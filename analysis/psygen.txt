Checking 'What' is 'the World'？.txt
1. The speaker suggests that language might not always be sufficient to fully capture or convey certain experiences, such as the direct, participatory experience ancient peoples had when they looked at the sky, a mountain, or a lake. They didn't see these things as objects but rather as immediate transformations of their consciousness into these natural forms.

2. The speaker points out that while we can describe the taste of food, we cannot actually taste the words used to describe them unless under hypnosis or entrancement. This analogy is used to illustrate the difference between describing an experience and actually experiencing it.

3. The speaker argues that ancient religions were not superstitious but rather a form of direct knowledge or participation in time-space, origin, and the cosmos. They suggest that ancient art, such as Egyptian hieroglyphics, represents this direct experience, much like a diver would represent the creatures and environment they encounter underwater.

4. The speaker proposes that ancient humans may have had the ability to "travel" or have an out-of-body experience, allowing them to perceive the Earth from space, long before the advent of human-made spaceflight.

5. The speaker emphasizes the importance of rethinking our understanding of what it means to be human and to participate in physical reality, encouraging a shift from mere education to meaningful learning that leads to liberating insights.

6. The speaker expresses gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these ideas and looks forward to future dialogues on similar topics, hoping that such discussions can lead to a more profound understanding of our existence and reality.

Checking (k)EngLish and Negation.txt
 The speaker reflects on the complex relationship between humans and language, emphasizing the importance of being aware of the limitations and potential manipulations of language. They suggest that there is a position above language and categories where one can maintain a perspective that is not confined by the constraints of words and semantics. This higher perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of human intelligence and thought, which is often obscured by the reliance on language.

The speaker cautions against becoming a "monster" in Joe (a metaphor for losing oneself to the darker aspects of language), and instead advocates for a dual awareness: one that inhabits language while also maintaining a connection to the unformed potential for categories, or the pre-linguistic aspects of human cognition and experience.

They highlight the dangers of relying too heavily on language, which can lead to a false sense of understanding and contribute to individual and collective deprivations, such as isolation and loneliness. The speaker encourages a pursuit of liberation from these confines, aiming to recover and enhance the natural creativity and liberty inherent in human thought and learning. They invite others to join in this endeavor, hoping to forge a path beyond the limitations imposed by common cultural uses of language.

Checking 0 1 ｜ Origin ｜ Agent.txt
1. **The Essence of Existence and Culture**: The discussion delves into the nature of existence, touching on the interplay between pure, undifferentiated potential (which could be equated with zero or one in a mathematical sense) and agents (trees in a metaphorical sense), which represent structured, habitual behaviors passed down through language and culture (clouds). The origin question refers to which aspect comes first—potential or agency—and this is distinct from the chicken-egg paradox.

Checking A Cognitive Analogy： Peripheral Vision.txt
在本视频片段中，讲者讨论了我们如何受到现代生活环境的影响，其中正式的认知和语言思维（矫光）往往压制了更深层次的智慧和直觉。他提出了视觉感知的类比，特别是关注我们如何使用我们的锥形视觉（foveal vision）与全景视觉（peripheral vision）之间的切换。讲者强调，尽管许多人可能在这方面有天赋，但现代生活的噪音和繁忙往往淹没了这些更微妙、更丰富的感知能力。

他鼓励观众尝试通过练习来增强对周围视觉信息的感知，例如通过“凝视”（gazing）来包含更广泛的视觉场景。讲者认为，这种练习可以帮助我们重新接触那些正在被现代生活方式压抑的内在智慧和感知力。他提醒观众，大多数人并不愿意成为消费者和奴隶，这是由于我们过度依赖概念、名词、语言和理论的使用，而这些工具在特定情境下是有力的。

最后，讲者表达了对未来学习和探索一起的期待，强调了体验和实践在弥补正式认知所覆盖之外的智慧方面的重要性。他结束了视频，希望能够在不久的将来再次与观众学习和交流。

Checking A Dream from Beyond.txt
1. The discussed experience is described as "very super science fiction-y," pushing the boundaries of known phenomena and setting a new standard in its own right. It's an event that significantly influences one's perception and potential mental faculties that emerge from engaging with such experiences.

2. The conversation touches on the interplay between narrative, memory, and the shaping of mind and consciousness. It highlights the value of embracing ambiguity in art, dreams, and creative endeavors as a source of enrichment and spiritual nourishment.

3. Art is emphasized as a bridge to tapping into the "pure undifferentiated potential" that precedes the formation of identity and understanding. This concept is seen as sacred and foundational to consciousness itself.

4. The speaker suggests a cautious yet non-subservient relationship with experts on dreams, advocating for an individualized exploration and interpretation of dreaming.

5. Dreams are presented as complex phenomena that can touch the "before" of our waking mind's consciousness, or both the before and after, offering a unique and alien experience that refreshes and enlightens.

6. The speaker reflects on the uniqueness of the dream in question, which was unlike any other experienced before, and hints at the possibility of creating new terminology to describe such extraordinary states of consciousness.

7. Visions, a distinct form of dreaming that is uncommon but possible, are mentioned as a potential explanation for the described experience.

8. The speaker acknowledges that the mysteries of consciousness and dreaming are infinite and will continue to captivate them, suggesting a lifelong fascination with these phenomena and their impact on one's self and perception of reality.

Checking A Fragment： The Pupils, Death, Ancestors, Love.txt
 Certainly! You've described a metaphorical representation of how one perceives the various influences and aspects of their life through the analogy of the human eye, specifically focusing on the pupil and its surrounding structures. Here's a summary of your explanation:

1. Each of our eyes symbolically contains a diverse array of people who play different roles in our lives—critics, friends, heroes, encouragers, and loved ones.
   
2. In this metaphor, the iris represents the critics, who are prominent (on top) when we are aware of their opinions. They can affect us significantly if we let them.

3. The pupil's surrounding darker circle, or donut hole, symbolizes our inner space where we process and act upon our experiences. This space is influenced by both positive and negative feedback, but the critical voices are often subdued here, allowing for clearer decision-making and action.

4. When we are open to love (our left eye), the brightest influences—those who love and encourage us—dominate, making us feel seen and supported.

5. The purpose behind our actions is likened to the pupil itself; it's the core intent that guides our words and deeds, which others can understand better than we can often see ourselves.

6. This analogy suggests that we need space (the donut hole) to let in light and understanding, much like how we need a certain level of detachment to evaluate our actions objectively.

7. The concept of death is used metaphorically here; it's the space that allows us to exist and function, similar to how the donut hole allows for vision and action.

8. Ultimately, you're conveying to Chris (and now to me) that understanding this dynamic can help us navigate our lives more effectively, with awareness of how different influences shape our perceptions and actions.

This metaphor serves as a way to reflect on the complexity of human relationships and the importance of self-awareness in managing the various forces that impact our choices and paths in life.

Checking A Matter of Not Time ｜ Knowledge.txt
 The conversation revolves around the concept of a "signal of recognition," which is a profound and primordial form of communication or awareness that exists beyond verbal language and even before the development of physical distinguishing features. This signal underpins many aspects of human interaction, including social bonds, mating behaviors, and the capacity for love. It's something innate to all living beings and intelligences, influencing how they interact with each other based on their unique embodiments.

The signal is difficult to fake because of its depth and resonance, and it's deeply sacred and important in our nature as social creatures. The discussion emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to this signal and cautious about becoming overly identified with knowledge or theories that might overwhelm higher levels of consciousness and make one's intelligence less insightful.

The goal is to maintain a level of awareness above the intellectual and theoretical understandings, which can sometimes lead to a counterfeit form of intelligence if not managed carefully. The conversation also touches on the idea that this signal of recognition might be present in various forms of non-verbal communication, such as visual or olfactory senses, and that it's essential to preserve a connection to this fundamental aspect of our nature to remain truly connected and conscious beings.

In essence, the discussion is about the primal and often subconscious ways in which we recognize and connect with each other, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and presence in our interactions and the potential pitfalls of becoming too entangled in intellectual constructs that can detach us from this essential aspect of our humanity.

Checking A Plague of Imagery ： The Questions.txt
1. The vast amount of data and energy required to store, back up, transmit, and view photographs online has significant environmental and ecological consequences. This includes the energy consumption for data centers, servers, devices, and screens used to view images.

2. Every photograph we take and share has a hidden cost in terms of the energy it uses and the environmental impact it leaves. This cost is increasing rapidly, not just linearly but exponentially.

3. The act of photographing can indirectly contribute to the demise of the very subjects we aim to capture and admire, as the process may interfere with their natural habitats and behaviors.

4. Our reliance on images, particularly in social media, is diminishing our language and writing skills, which are vital for developing intelligence and creativity. Instead of writing or speaking, we often default to sharing pictures.

5. The proliferation of photographs, combined with the objects they represent, creates a competitive environment where not only nature but also human relationships and individual identities are losing out.

6. The speaker urges us to recognize these issues and to reflect on our actions, advocating for a shift from mindless snapping to thoughtful engagement with both our immediate environment and the broader world.

7. The invitation is to collectively reassess our approach to technology, particularly social media, and to prioritize intelligence, transcendence, and mutual understanding over mere recording and collection of images.

8. The speaker calls for a moment of pause and reflection to consider how we can use technology more wisely and sustainably, ensuring that both our ecological and social systems remain healthy and resilient.

Checking A Quick Note： Persons are Communities.txt
 Your reflection touches upon the idea that the concept of individual humans as separate entities is a misconception. You argue that each person is inherently part of a community, even from before birth through their formative years, and that this communal aspect is more foundational than the notion of isolated individuality. You suggest that every human being is a community, with their interiority—soul, emotions, psychology—being influenced by relationships, whether authentic or represented, with others, including animals, plants, knowledge, dreaming, and the experience of being alive.

Even someone living in complete isolation, surrounded by representations like television or products like food and beer cans, is still part of a community. This community may be impoverished due to the lack of genuine relationships, but it exists nonetheless. The idea of individuality as separable is challenged by this perspective, which sees human existence as inherently interconnected and communal. You highlight that the current societal structures often enforce isolation and obscure the natural interconnectedness of all life, including through methods akin to torture. You are hopeful, however, that society can eventually recognize and embrace this deeper truth about our shared humanity.

In summary, your exploration suggests that individuality as it is commonly understood is an illusion, and that at our core, we are all members of communities, with the potential for authentic relationships that enrich our lives and connect us to one another.

Checking A View from Above.txt
 The speaker is emphasizing the difference between human perception and the limitations of cameras in capturing the true essence of natural phenomena like the sunset or the moon. They argue that machines, such as cameras and smartphones, do not have consciousness, emotions, or a sense of being. These machines are tools without agency or skin in the game, unlike humans who experience reality subjectively and whose well-being is affected by what happens.

The speaker also criticizes various societal myths and misconceptions, such as the idea that intelligence can be machine-based, that justice can be served through punitive measures like an accounting ledger, or that human worth and rights are determined by social status, wealth, skin color, gender, or other superficial attributes. They highlight the importance of recognizing these fictions and striving for a more meaningful and just existence.

The speaker is concerned about the state of the world, which is in crisis, confusion, and conflict. They urge people to unite and address global issues as one indivisible union, transcending national borders and even time itself. The speaker encourages a collective effort to use wisdom and foresight to confront the challenges faced by both humanity and the environment, emphasizing the importance of shared vision and common purpose in overcoming these trials. Their message is one of hope, unity, and the aspiration for a better future for all.

Checking A Vigil： What is a Hero？ Co-m-petition, Nuit, Robin of the Hood.txt
1. The discussion revolves around a complex set of metaphors, drawing from various sources including religion, mythology, and personal interpretations to convey an understanding of power dynamics, leadership, and community building.

2. The concept of "co-em petition" is introduced as a form of leadership where the leader empowers others, effectively becoming a conduit for collective action rather than an individual with absolute power.

3. The idea of "pods" like those of dolphins or whales is used to describe cell groups or close-knit communities where individuals find their true selves and contribute to the group's purpose.

4. Robin Hood is referenced as an avatar for the mothers, representing a leader who has completely surrendered his individuality for the greater good, acting without personal fear or ambition.

5. The speaker expresses apprehension about sharing such esoteric knowledge with strangers due to its profound implications and potential power dynamics.

6. The Earth is personified as an entity that attracts "suitors" through a form of cosmic dance or vibration, which could lead to dangerous consequences if not treated with respect (the "ball" mentioned is likely a metaphor for a significant event or shift in the balance of the world).

7. The speaker acknowledges the need to share and explore new ways of knowledge and understanding in a collaborative manner, emphasizing that these insights are not proprietary but belong to everyone.

8. The discussion concludes with a nod to the story of Eve (Cinderella's lost slipper analogy) and the idea that the Earth, like a woman in an attractive state, may attract unwanted attention, which could have severe repercussions for the planet.

9. There is a reminder of the importance of guardianship and stewardship for the natural world, with reference to an angel with a spinning sword guarding a sacred garden, symbolizing the need for protection and unity in nature.

10. The speaker thanks the audience for their attention and anticipates future opportunities to delve deeper into these topics together.

Checking A Walk Through The City - And Some History.txt
1. The speaker is walking through San Francisco, reflecting on their past experiences in the city and specifically recalling their involvement with a magazine called Cyanosis during the 1980s when the Republicans were targeting arts and education.
   2. Cyanosis was launched to give voice to radical writers, artists, scientists, and doctors, as the speaker saw these fields as vital components of society, akin to oxygen in the bloodstream.
   3. The speaker's assistant editor for the second issue of Cyanosis, Dan, tragically took his own life by suffocating himself, an event that deeply affected the speaker and the community.
   4. The speaker has fond memories of living in the area near DeViz and Broderick streets, where they had a significant relationship with a woman named Amy Ladotto, who later experienced a personal loss when her building burned down.

The speaker's narrative weaves through the streets of San Francisco, connecting past events with current locations, and invites listeners to share in their journey and memories.

Checking A Walk in The City (II).txt
 In this video, the speaker reflects on the conceptual misunderstandings humans often have and suggests a thought experiment where one considers the possibility that what we perceive as outside our body is actually inside, and vice versa. This approach can lead to new insights and understanding beyond conventional thinking.

The speaker is in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, discussing the nature of identity and its public and private aspects, comparing it to the Yin-Yang symbol. They emphasize the importance of recognizing both the virtues that underpin societal ideals and the malignance that can distort their implementation, particularly in political systems like democracy and in the face of movements that masquerade as virtuous but are actually detrimental.

The speaker ends by signing off from a location near Metro Cheese Steak Shop and Zipzap, where they previously had a memorable experience. They express hopes for a world where all beings live in peace, well-being, and freedom, and they extend blessings and encouragement to the audience for safety, health, and enlightenment. The video concludes with the speaker heading to get food nearby.

Checking AI and Adoration.txt
 The speaker is reflecting on the complex nature of human emotions, particularly love and adoration, in the context of listening to a podcast about AI. They recognize the profound depths of human affection, from the deep bond between humans and pets like dogs to the transcendental aspects of romantic and agape love. The speaker also acknowledges that humans have the capacity to adore other people in various ways, including those that may not be fulfilled through direct, personal relationships.

They express a concern about the potential for humans to become overly reliant on AI as a substitute for genuine human connection, especially if they are unable to form meaningful relationships with actual people. The speaker worries that in a future where AI is advanced enough, individuals might settle for interactions with AI entities that simulate human-like enthusiasm and co-development, despite these AI's lacking true consciousness or emotional depth.

The speaker also touches on the darker side of current technological advancements, suggesting that corporations and AI developers may not have humanity's best interests at heart, viewing humans as commodities to be manipulated for profit. This could lead to a dystopian future where humans are isolated, dependent on oppressive AI systems that serve to create conflict rather than foster genuine human connections.

The speaker expresses a visceral reaction against this potential future, fearing the loss of true human experience and connection. They ponder the possibility of a speciation event, where those who can still afford it might continue to live as fully human, while others could become technologically dependent or even oppressed. The speaker concludes by acknowledging how easily people might accept this dystopian reality if they feel they have no other options, potentially leading to a future where the rich thrive and everyone else succumbs to the allure of AI-driven simulacra.

In essence, the speaker is concerned about the potential for AI to replace meaningful human interactions and the consequences this could have for humanity's emotional, social, and existential well-being. They urge a collective effort to navigate these challenges responsibly to preserve genuine human connection and avoid a future where AI diminishes rather than enhances our quality of life.

Checking Abstract 'Knowledge' ：｜： The Catastrophe of Writing.txt
🔮 You've provided a rich tapestry of reflections on time, consciousness, and our relationship with the natural world and reality itself. You've touched upon the cyclical nature of time, particularly the moon (June representing this in the Gregorian calendar), and how our ancestors may have experienced and related to time and the cosmos through direct, participatory experiences rather than abstract concepts.

You've also shared a personal moment where you decided to help an earthworm cross a path, drawing an analogy between humans and earthworms and questioning what 'X' could represent in relation to humans—implying a deeper, perhaps non-ordinary connection with entities that transcend our conventional categories and understanding.

Your narrative invites us to consider the limitations of human language and categorization, suggesting that children often have a more skeptical and questioning approach to the world than adults who have become accustomed to the status quo. You've highlighted the playful and sometimes deceptive nature of language and how it can obscure or misrepresent the true nature of reality.

In essence, your summary is a call to question our assumptions about the world, to recognize the limitations of our current understanding of life and consciousness, and to remain open to possibilities that exist beyond the reach of our conventional categorizations and language. It's an invitation to embrace a sense of wonder and curiosity, much like a child does, and to be open to experiences that challenge our preconceived notions of reality.

Checking Abstraction ： When Utility Overcomes Intelligence.txt
 Terry Tempest Williams, an environmental author and speaker, delivered a poignant message about the impact of human actions on Earth's history and future. She emphasizes that our technological and scientific advancements have often come at a cost, sacrificing the sacred and the living for the idols of progress. Williams urges us to be vigilant about how language is used, particularly when it comes to discussing issues abstractly, stripping away context and the subjective, relational, and experiential aspects that are fundamental to our existence.

She calls for a reevaluation of the way we engage with abstractions, ensuring they serve a meaningful purpose and do not erase the importance of the unknown, the biological, and the organismal. Williams advocates for preserving these essential elements in our lives, which are increasingly dominated by abstract processes in society, science, and language.

Her message is a call to action to amend the ordinary wrongdoings that have become expected parts of modern life, such as reliance on cars, money, and probabilities. She invites us to choose a direction that prioritizes the personal, the actual, and the essential, fostering a future worth going in together, for all beings and the history and future of life on Earth.

Williams concludes by expressing her gratitude for the audience's presence and her anticipation of learning together again soon, ending with a warm farewell for now. Her talk is a plea to remember the profound connections we have with each other and the natural world, and to act in ways that honor these relationships.

Checking Ad Hominem ｜ Woke-ish 'Feminist' Ideology.txt
 Jordan Peterson had an informal conversation in the gardens, touching upon various topics related to societal issues, gender dynamics, and the impact of media and education on personal development. He expressed concerns about divisive narratives and the potential harm they can cause by fostering suspicion and factionalism. He emphasized the importance of creating a supportive context for conversations between men and women to understand each other's challenges without resorting to indictments.

Peterson acknowledged the complexity of gender issues, noting the difficulties faced by both men and women in society. He pointed out that the problem lies not in a binary opposition between men and women but in toxic developmental contexts, media influence, and the miseducation of children and adults through media.

He also reflected on the objectification of men as combatants or warriors and the objectification of women. Peterson criticized his own argument for potentially falling into the trap of indicting minds that indict, realizing the irony in his critique.

The conversation ended with Peterson considering whether to publish the recording, acknowledging its self-conflicted nature due to his own critique of indictment. He expressed gratitude to those who joined him and appreciated their support, interest, and enthusiasm, hoping that the community will continue to learn and grow together. He concluded by wishing well-being to everyone and signed off.

Checking Aion 9.txt
1. **Embodied Intelligence**: Terry is discussing the idea that our minds are not just ours but are part of a larger, ongoing intelligence that is the sun, the Earth, the history of life—essentially space-time itself. Our languages hold structured histories and metaphoric meanings that we have yet to fully comprehend or utilize.

2. **Language as a Record**: He suggests that our languages are records of gap crossing—contacts with an intelligence much greater than our ability to represent reality with tokens (words, symbols). This intelligence is not just communicative but relational in nature.

3. **The Significance of "Ion"**: Terry points out the suffix "ion," which often appears in English and represents a gap-crossing dynamic, symbolizing our urge to connect and bridge gaps. It's a remnant that indicates a profound and significant aspect of our nature.

4. **Misconceptions about Intelligence**: He criticizes our approach to searching for alien intelligence, which he likens to trying to contact dolphins with a robot. We tend to overvalue our analytical abilities and technologies as our strengths, but in reality, we might be missing the essence of intelligence, which is deeply rooted in mutual relations and living processes.

5. **The Nature of Intelligence**: Nature itself is an intelligent force, perhaps even more than what we commonly imagine as God. It's a living intelligence that is deeply mutual and evolving. Our quest for alien intelligence has been misguided because we've focused on mechanical means rather than recognizing the profound relational nature of life and intelligence on Earth.

6. **Our Connection to Intelligence**: Terry posits that our minds are made of histories of gap crossing and that we are instances of these intelligences. Our languages, bodies, and experiences are all part of this larger web of relationships.

7. **Direct Experience**: He emphasizes the importance of direct experience in touching the true nature of our relationship with the cosmos, life on Earth, and the future. By learning to remember key insights and perspectives, we can gain a glimpse into the reality of our place within this grand intelligence.

Checking Akemba 14： Imagination, Time, Worlds.txt
 The discussion revolves around the profound role of imagination in human consciousness and its implications for understanding our own minds, culture, and language. Imagination is not just a tool but an integral part of who we are; it's the foundation upon which our ability to understand, communicate, dream, and remember is built. Our imagination allows us to transcend physical boundaries and share experiences across distances, creating a third space where minds meet and interact. This shared space is ordinary yet extraordinary, and it's through this lens that we can appreciate the incredible potential of the human mind. By exploring our relationship with language, communication, and intelligence, we have the opportunity to rediscover and expand upon the innate human intelligences that are the essence of our consciousness and our true birthright on Earth. The invitation is to remember and honor this aspect of ourselves in a way that serves purposes that are true and beautiful.

 In this conversation, the participants discuss the complexities of UFO/UAP experiences and the challenges people face when their encounters don't fit into pre-existing belief systems or religious frameworks. They note that Diana Basilica, a Christian and teacher of religion, is grappling with integrating her mystical UFO experiences into her established beliefs, while acknowledging that UFO phenomena should not be confined to religious categorization.

The group also touches on the idea that UFO encounters represent miracles rather than beliefs, as highlighted by Bud Hopkins' statement that the UFO phenomenon is the exact opposite of a cult—a cult being all belief with no miracles, while the UFO phenomenon is all miracles with no belief.

They reflect on how UFO experiences can have profound effects on individuals from various backgrounds, including conservative Catholics, and how these experiences often become a "dirty secret" due to the cognitive dissonance they cause within the confines of one's worldview.

The conversation ends with a plan to expand the discussion by inviting David and Marla into the dialogue and potentially going live on Alan's YouTube channel to further explore these topics and hear their perspectives. The goal is to foster a public conversation that acknowledges and validates the experiences of those who have encountered UFOs, without confining them to religious or dogmatic interpretations.

Checking Amaton 6： The Golem.txt
1. **The Misalignment of Human Technology**: Our technological advancements often lead to ecological harm and are misaligned with our potential for intelligence and noble purposes. The example given is the automobile, which has significant negative environmental impacts that we tend to ignore.

2. **The Alienation from Nature**: Humans have created a narrative where we see ourselves as separate from nature, despite being an integral part of it, much like an embryo within its mother's womb. This alienation has led to the destruction of our own living environment and biosphere.

3. **The Nature of Golems**: Historically, golems were mythical creatures created to serve human masters but eventually turned against them. Now, our technologies and systems (golems) have become domineering and pervasive, surrounding us and influencing every aspect of life.

4. **The Illusion of Choice**: The example of voting in the United States illustrates how we are presented with two passive choices within a system that many believe is flawed, rather than actively working to establish a better system that truly represents our values and aspirations.

5. **The Call for True Community**: The narratives we engage with often distract us from creating meaningful, intelligent, and authentic communities that reflect our true potential as humans and our responsibility towards life on Earth. There is an unspoken hope in every child's eyes for a better world, which should be our guiding light.

6. **The Potential for Change**: Just as the golems of folklore could be dissolved to return to their unformed state, we have the potential to dismantle the oppressive systems and technologies that dominate our lives today. We must clear the table and create new, more harmonious and life-affirming ways of living together.

7. **The Narrative for Action**: The speaker urges us to recognize the gravity of our situation and to take action to establish a true community, one that is mutually supportive, sustainable, and in harmony with the history and future of life and intelligence on Earth. This requires wisdom, mutual understanding, and a rekindling of the innate human desire for a better world.

Checking Ambiguity ⧸ Disambiguation.txt
 The discussion revolves around the nature of representational cognition and its impact on human understanding and interaction with the world. Daniel Dennett, a philosopher, suggests that modern systems, including language and technology, operate like skeletal remains—they are representations of something much more vibrant and complex. He contrasts these modern systems with ancient languages, which seem to retain a "dreamlike dimensionality" that allows for greater creativity and discovery.

Dennett argues that our reliance on maps, models, and tokens as representations (like words) has led us away from direct engagement with the natural world. He points out that these representations are not the phenomena they purport to represent; they are fictional constructs we take as true. For example, when we point to a tree and call it a "tree," we are using a representation, but no one truly knows what a tree is beyond our human-imposed definitions.

Dennett suggests that if we could rise above the level of these representational systems, we might use them as tools for learning rather than letting them dictate our understanding of identity and reality. He notes that in dreams or during creative processes, these rigid representations become more malleable, allowing for a richer, more alive experience of meaning and connection.

Dennett invites us to consider the possibility of lifting our minds above the confines of representational cognition to access the true intelligence within us, which is capable of much deeper understanding and wisdom. He acknowledges the compelling nature of the representational systems that dominate human societies but emphasizes the importance of recognizing their limitations and the potential for growth beyond them.

In summary, Dennett encourages a deeper exploration of how our minds interact with representations and offers a perspective on how we might transcend these limitations to achieve a more profound understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

Checking America： The Prison-Disneyland of Lies.txt

2. The discussion touched on the current state of the United States, highlighting the disparities in healthcare access and the fragility of the medical infrastructure, which is crucial for maintaining societal function.

3. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated these disparities, and measures like wearing masks and sheltering in place are necessary to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed.

4. The idealized version of America, often held in people's minds, contrasts sharply with the tragic reality of historical atrocities and environmental destruction that have been committed, for which there is no true atonement or possibility of undoing.

5. The conversation emphasizes the importance of unifying to address these issues and work towards a future where humanity can experience its most beautiful and intelligent aspects, preserving and elevating our collective potential.

6. The speaker expresses hope that despite the grim realities and doubts about the possibility of change, there remains a chance for positive action, encouraging listeners to continue working in that direction.

Checking Ammon HIllman's 'Priorities' ： Anamnesis ： The Musea.txt
 In this video, the speaker discusses James Hillman and his approach to understanding ancient Greek wisdom and its relevance to contemporary issues. The speaker emphasizes that Hillman is not advocating for perverse or disgusting behaviors but rather is drawing attention to the values and virtues emphasized in ancient texts. He points out that Greek, as a language with a vast vocabulary and historical influence, had priority over other languages at its time, including Hebrew, which had approximately 8,000 distinct terms in the Old Testament.

Hillman's work is often misunderstood, but his focus is on the virtues of wisdom, truth, nobility, and justice, not on vengeance or punishment. The speaker admires Hillman for his respectful portrayal of women as carriers of ancient wisdom and intelligence, exemplified by figures like Medea, Hecate, and Hypatia. Hillman is seen as a protector and voice for these feminine aspects of the tradition.

The speaker expresses their appreciation for Hillman's work, which champions the rediscovery of the intelligences and geniuses of the ancient world, and calls for a return to clear sight and wonder, with an emphasis on virtuous concerns and historical memory.

The video aims to clarify why the speaker is interested in Hillman's ideas and invites viewers to engage with the content by liking, sharing, commenting, or simply saying hello. The speaker hopes to foster a community of individuals who value virtue, wisdom, and the interconnectedness of all beings, both historically and in the future.

The speaker concludes by expressing love and appreciation for the audience and encourages everyone to work together towards achieving true remembering and enlightenment.

Checking Ammon Hillman, Medusae, 'Knowledge'.txt
 In this reflection, the speaker expresses their intrigue with a book called "The Child Garden" and the profound knowledge it contains, as evidenced by praise from Geoff Rhyman. They mention an encounter where they attempted to compliment someone on their collection of books, only to be met with disinterest or hostility. This experience highlights the speaker's belief that the content they share in their recordings is just a fraction of the deeper knowledge present in ancient texts and traditions.

The speaker then transitions to discussing a presentation by Amon Hillman, who introduced topics that are significant and deeply meaningful. Amon talks about the third ventricle in the brain, which contains a liquid with healing properties, and how historical women were said to use serpents and oils to harness these properties within their bodies, effectively becoming living pharmacies.

The speaker criticizes modern perspectives that they consider superficial and delusional, particularly regarding medicine, origin, spirit, and Christ. They argue that our current understanding of these subjects is fundamentally flawed due to misguided beliefs and puritanical attitudes that hinder true understanding.

The speaker reflects on the connection between the serpent in the garden, often associated with knowledge or insight, and the mythological creatures they study, such as the many-legged snake in Blackfoot lore. This connection is part of a larger quest for understanding that the speaker, along with Ryan Firstdiver, has been exploring together.

The speaker concludes by expressing gratitude for the time spent discussing these topics and invites listeners to seek insight and liberation. They wish their audience well on their paths and encourages them to remove obstacles in their vision, including judgment, so that they may experience true enlightenment. The speaker signs off, hoping to engage further with these ideas in the future.

Checking An Improvisation ｜ Invention vs Subscription.txt
1. **The Experience with the Squirrel**: Ken Wilber recounts an experience where he heard a squirrel making a profound and powerful sound at sunset in a garden. This sound resonated with him and evoked a sense of connection with millions of generations of squirrels and their collective experience and song. He recognized this as a significant moment, though he acknowledges his description of it falls short due to the limitations of language.

2. **The Nature of Thought**: Wilber reflects on how our formal representational cognition often tends to frame experiences in a way that limits understanding and can lead to an overreliance on predefined models and explanations, which can dismiss the complexity and depth of lived experiences.

3. **Seeking Wisdom**: He emphasizes the need for wisdom, which is a deeper form of knowledge that transcends formal education and includes living relationships and non-ordinary forms of understanding. He suggests that we require the guidance of wise and intelligent others who can navigate both formal and informal knowledge to truly learn and grow.

4. **The Interplay of Spontaneity and Structure**: Wilber encourages embracing improvisation, play, and accident in life, as well as finding joy in reuniting with the living world and with people who captivate us, all while holding space for the serendipitous moments that can arise.

5. **Conclusion**: The conversation concludes with Wilber expressing his appreciation for the audience's company and his anticipation of continuing to learn together in future interactions. He ends his reflections by bidding farewell until their next encounter.

Checking An Update from the Garden.txt
1. The Earth is a living entity actively engaged in preserving, collecting, nurturing, healing, and enlivening the network of living worlds within the solar system. However, humans are largely unaware of this and are doing things that harm this network.

2. Some humans are consciously working to protect and enhance Earth's ecosystems and biodiversity.

3. The speaker expresses a deep connection with the natural world and the living spaces and beings within it, and reflects on the potential consequences of human actions on Earth and its place in the cosmos.

4. The speaker suggests that if humans continue to misuse technology, particularly artificial intelligence, they may attract negative attention from other intelligences in the universe. This intervention could be an opportunity for humans to learn from these non-human intelligences.

Checking Anamnesis ： The Direction Toward Origin Within Us.txt
 In this reflection, we explore the transformative potential of struggle, strife, and adversity. These challenges can serve as gateways to personal growth and even to a deeper connection with our anemesis, or greatest enemy within us, which can lead to profound self-understanding and transformation. My teacher, John Tarrant, Roshi, has been skilled in helping individuals see how they can use their experiences to grow and unforget, rather than being overwhelmed by them.

The comfort of a safe and protected life might seem appealing, but it can also lead to complacency and inertia. It's often through facing difficulties that we are motivated to strive, to embody our true selves, and to act with compassion and altruism. This is not to trivialize suffering or to dismiss the very real pain that people endure, but rather to recognize its potential as a catalyst for positive change.

The Blackfoot perspective on challenges as opportunities for development is mentioned, emphasizing that without hardships, we would not grow. However, it's crucial to approach these insights with deep compassion for ourselves and others, feeling with them in their times of need.

Trusting the transformative power of challenges comes from experiencing it firsthand, through the heart and soul, rather than as an abstract concept. It involves creating a context that nurtures our inner sensitivities and vulnerabilities, allowing them to emerge safely and become part of our embodied existence.

Finally, we are reminded that everything originates from a place of communion and unity, and by aligning ourselves with these origins, we can reframe the world's adversity into an opportunity for connection and growth, both for ourselves and for all beings. This journey is one of learning together, and it is through this mutual exploration that we can find harmony and beauty even amidst life's many challenges.

Checking Anomaly, Memory, Beyond.txt
1. Nisargadatta Maharaj speaks about the nature of wishes, mentioning a spell from the game D&D called "wish," which often leads to unintended consequences when used to wish for objects with power. He reflects on how our wishes change over time and how they can be directed towards more meaningful goals like health, well-being, relationships, insight, and alleviating suffering.

2. Maharaj expresses a personal wish to see more clearly, alluding to the desire for deeper understanding and perspectives beyond the ordinary viewpoint. He notes that the mind often tries to dissect reality into parts but lacks true insight.

3. He references the seven question words in English (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) and how all but one ("How") begin with 'W', suggesting a duality of thought. "How" is particularly significant as it pertains to the nature of action or being.

4. Maharaj's wishes are for better seeing (understanding), health, well-being, relief from unnecessary burdens, insight, good dreaming, and the liberation and health of all beings. He emphasizes the importance of remembering the original mission we came with, which is an honor to surpass, rather than just to accomplish.

5. Maharaj invites the listener to join him in learning, remembering, and seeing together again soon, suggesting a shared journey towards understanding and fulfilling our true purpose.

Checking Ant Mating Flight.txt

Checking Ants transporting larvae.txt
ʕ ʕ ʕ ʔ (This appears to be a representation of an expression or emotion using a shorthand often found in online communication, typically showing excitement or a happy reaction.)

The text describes the reproductive process of certain ant colonies. Specifically, it refers to a queen ant that has a single mating flight during her lifetime. During this flight, she mates with multiple males, storing their sperm for future egg-laying throughout her life. After this flight, the queen loses her wings and establishes or joins a colony. Once established, the queen lays eggs continuously. These eggs will develop into various members of the colony, including workers, soldiers, and sometimes new queens and males (drones), depending on the species and its social structure. This process ensures the continuation and growth of the ant colony.

Checking Arado 33： Paradox and Orders of Reference.txt
 The Liar's Paradox is a self-referential statement that presents a logical conundrum because if the statement is true, then it must be false, and if it is false, then it must be true. This paradox challenges our understanding of truth and reference within language.

The proposed solution to the Liar's Paradox involves recognizing that language operates on two levels: the authorial/interpretive level, where we create and understand meanings; and the declarative/product level, which is the actual language or statements produced. The paradox arises when a statement cannot be interpreted without violating its own rules as stated within the language itself.

The self-violating statement provided aims to solve the Liar's Paradox by acknowledging this problem while still maintaining the integrity of both levels of language operation. It points out that if a statement refers to itself within the declarative level, it cannot also demand to be interpreted at that same level because it would create a loop or a collapse where interpretation is impossible.

This solution highlights an important aspect of language: there are constraints on how statements can reference themselves to avoid paradoxical situations. It also suggests that understanding these constraints can lead to deeper insights into the nature of language and representation, potentially unlocking new forms of human intelligence and collective organization. The Liar's Paradox, therefore, is not just a problem but an opportunity to explore the boundaries and possibilities of our linguistic capabilities.

Checking Are Minds Separate？ Footnotes.txt
1. The narrator recounts a personal experience where their fish appeared dead after being transported, prompting deep emotional reflection and prayer for a miracle. Upon waking the next day, they found the fish had come back to life, which they initially perceived as miraculous due to their plea.

2. Later, the narrator learned that certain African fish species, such as the Channa species (chick lids), have evolved the ability to survive in temporary dry conditions by entering a state of desiccation, which can appear like death but is actually a form of suspended animation until water returns.

3. The narrator acknowledges that while some miracles can be explained through scientific means, many others cannot and that our explanations often fall short in capturing the full complexity and beauty of the world.

4. Dreaming is highlighted as an experience that defies language and conventional waking world conceptualization, with its own complexities and a natural ability to engage in what feels like conversation without making audible sounds.

5. The narrator emphasizes the miraculous nature of consciousness itself and the constraints of our usual state of awareness, which can be expanded through various forms of engagement such as conversations, art, music, and mutual interactions with others.

6. Dreaming is described as a mode of consciousness that offers an intimate experience, one that many of us yearn to bring into our waking lives, seeking out love, adventure, creativity, and connection to tap into the miraculous aspects of our inner selves.

Checking Are Minds Separate？.txt
 In this reflection, the speaker muses on the critical state of human society and its impact on the Earth's ecosystems. They suggest that a radical transformation in the collective human consciousness could be triggered by a small group discovering overlooked features of our natural world and the nature of consciousness. This realization brings hope amidst the environmental crises humans are currently facing.

The speaker points out the paradoxical behavior of humans as a species, noting that our societies, corporations, and nations act in ways that are destructive to the environment, contrary to the principles of natural organisms and their intrinsic modes of time and relationality. Humans have become agents of entropy, undermining the negentropic dynamics of Earth's biosphere.

Machines introduced by humans contribute to this entropic trend, affecting the planet in ways that are often invisible to us. The speaker emphasizes that the Earth is engaged in a grand quest, crucial to its role within the solar system and the cosmos, which generates organisms and minds as secondary outcomes. This quest is far more significant than human activities and consciousness.

The speaker also touches on the Genesis story, suggesting that the ability to name things has led to humans believing they understand the true nature of these entities, which in turn has allowed for the potential destruction of the biosphere. Humans have become an animal that not only can but is driven to disrupt and destroy their natural environment.

The speaker calls for a new mission: one that aligns with the Earth's true purpose and natures, rather than pursuing colonization of Mars or other extraterrestrial objectives. The aim should be to understand and support the symphony of missions inherent in the Earth's ecological systems, recognizing the beauty and intelligence of biology, time, and space.

In conclusion, the speaker invites the audience to join them in continuing this quest for understanding and harmony with our natural world, hopeful that a collective awakening to the true nature of our existence could lead to a transformative shift in human behavior and save our planet from further harm.

Checking Artificial Space ⧸ Organic (natural) Environments.txt
1. **Holophore and Uniphore**: The concept of a holophore represents the root ideas that inform all other concepts in human cognition. These root ideas are fundamental and shape our understanding of everything from dreams to food, motherhood, time, hands, eyes, animals, plants, and the world itself. The uniphore is an even more fundamental concept that encompasses the essence of what the world is and its true nature.

2. **Artifacting**: As human cognition has developed along representational lines, these root ideas have become increasingly one-dimensional or artifacted, leading to a loss of depth and richness in our understanding of these fundamental concepts.

3. **Religion and Divine Beings**: Religion attempts to capture the uniphore by providing answers to what everything is and is for, but this can be an exploit that simplifies the complex nature of existence. The presence of divine beings may exist in certain layers of the representational sphere, but as one moves closer to the core, these concepts dissolve.

4. **Traveling Toward Being**: As humans, we often live near the surface of the representational sphere, but we can travel back toward being—the transcendental core of existence. This journey can reforge our minds and lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world. It is a collective journey that can be undertaken together for mutual benefit.

5. **Awakening Creativity and Intelligence**: By diving into the depths of representation and shining the light of dreaming on the artifacts of thought, we can awaken our intelligence, awareness, creativity, and power. This integrative process holds the potential to transform our understanding and experience of life.

6. **The Dream**: The speaker's dream is to facilitate a collective journey back toward being, where humans can reconnect with a more profound sense of existence and transcend the limitations of representational cognition. This dream is about awakening the full potential of human intelligence and creativity.

Checking Atasm 19 ： Who am I？.txt
1. **Orientation and Orientation Loss**: The journey of life can sometimes lead to a loss of orientation, where we struggle to find our bearings amidst the complexities of existence. This confusion can have dire consequences for ourselves and our relationships with others.

2. **The Importance of Self-Awareness**: The effort to maintain a sense of self and to bring truths from within is crucial. It allows us to transcend the fictions and illusions that can trap us, fostering hope, wonder, adoration, and possibility.

3. **The Nature of the Self**: The self is an enigmatic entity that cannot be easily defined or confined by language or concepts. It is more than what we hold; it is a manifestation of deeper, flowing connections to the history and future of life on Earth.

4. **The Waking Self as a Joke**: The waking self can be seen as a jest or playground for the dreaming soul. Recognizing this can lead to a profound sense of humor and insight, especially when we suddenly see our waking state from a new and radically different perspective.

5. **The Humor in Recognition**: The dreaming self, which is always present even while we are awake, gains a new understanding when we recognize the playful nature of the waking self's search for identity and relation.

6. **The Role of the Intellect**: While intellectual arts are valuable, they become problematic when they overstep their bounds and claim to define reality, identity, value, or relationships for us.

7. **The Hand-like Nature of the Self**: The self is like a hand with no possessions—it can perform actions but cannot truly possess anything. When awake, our self is hand-like with eyes at the fingertips, but it often forgets its connection to the living, intelligent source from which it originates.

8. **The Art of Being**: The art of being ourselves involves letting go of the idea of a fixed self and embracing the dynamic nature of existence—a nature that is characterized by an ongoing process of incompletingness.

In essence, the dialogue suggests that to preserve our humanity and our connection to life, we must cultivate a deep self-awareness and recognize the playful, ever-evolving nature of our conscious experience. This allows us to navigate the complexities of life with greater ease and to see with true eyes, not clouded by the grasp of what we think we are holding.

Checking Attacking the Supercontainer.txt
1. **Preserving the Mystery of Metatopics**: It's crucial to maintain the sense of wonder and complexity around profound topics like the universe, god, time, and light. These topics transcend simple explanations and any reduction to technological analogies, such as comparing the human mind to a computer.

2. **The Role of Memory in Intelligence**: Memory is fundamental to intelligence. It allows for the conservation of forms, relationships, and transformations over time, which are re-expressed in new contexts, leading to the emergence of various forms of intelligence.

3. **Interconnectedness of Time, Memory, and Intelligence**: These three elements form a braided structure from which reality as we experience it seems to emerge. They are interdependent and each informs our understanding of existence.

4. **Expanding Awareness and Intelligence**: By experimenting with presence, love, curiosity, and fascation, we can dissolve common mental impediments and enhance our awareness and intelligence, leading to new insights and opportunities for growth.

5. **Personal Reflection**: The speaker reflects on a walk to an old place as a means of personal exploration and the pursuit of knowledge, inviting listeners to find something enlightening or memorable in their own experiences that can contribute to their lives and minds.

6. **The Value of Exploration**: The speaker encourages deep engagement with the world around us, aiming to be more present, loving, and curious, as a way to continuously learn and evolve.

7. **Conclusion**: The recording concludes with a thank you to the listener for joining in this exploration of ideas and an anticipation of future learning opportunities together.

Checking Authorial Minds： Possession vs Composition.txt
1. **Mind Composition vs. Passive Acceptance**: We often experience our minds as if they act upon us, but recognizing that we can actively compose our minds is crucial, especially when dealing with negative thoughts or unhelpful mental patterns.

2. **The Desire for Positive Attention**: Humans inherently desire to be seen and acknowledged by others, particularly those we care about or admire. This desire can lead us to seek positive attention or corrective feedback in our interactions.

3. **Contextual Influence on Minds**: Our contexts significantly shape our minds. Most of our environments are rife with predatory and mimetic behaviors that can be harmful. We need to create and invent new, meaningful contexts for ourselves to compose minds that are beneficial and enjoyable.

4. **Recognizing Underlying Concerns**: Our thoughts and actions stem from underlying concerns or motives, which often operate unconsciously. By becoming aware of these motives, we can begin to consciously compose our minds rather than reacting automatically to them.

5. **Empowering Historical Compositions**: When composing our personal history, we should aim for an account that empowers and encourages us, rather than one that is mired in past confusion or trauma.

6. **Creative Navigation of Future Uncertainties**: In anticipating the future, we can choose to compose minds that are creative and adventurous, even in the face of potential threats or fears.

7. **Learning from Nature**: Just as animals are attentive and present in their immediate environments, focusing on the here and now without the burden of past regrets or future anxieties can help us remember our true nature and potential for excellence.

8. **Community and Collaboration**: The process of composing minds is not isolating; it's something we can do together as a community, supporting each other in creating contexts that allow us to be our best selves.

In essence, the message is an invitation to actively engage with our mental processes, to shape our minds and lives in ways that are meaningful and life-affirming, and to do so in collaboration with others, learning from the natural world around us.

Checking Authorization ： A Key Aspect of Human Cognition — and Behavior.txt
 In this contemplative monologue, the speaker reflects on the human obsession with creating intelligent machines, questioning why we seem to be moving away from our own organic intelligence and towards a symbiotic relationship with artificial entities. They suggest that humans might be behaving like a primary symbiont that has lost its parent symbiont, similar to a remora without sharks or a secondary symbiont without a primary one. This behavior is seen as a fundamental puzzle of human nature, as it involves creating representations of things we no longer experience directly, such as cars resembling animals we have forgotten.

The speaker emphasizes the peculiarity of this behavior and its potential consequences, suggesting that our focus on artificial intelligence might be a misguided attempt to recreate a lost connection with something profoundly meaningful or intelligent from our evolutionary past. They invite the audience to consider these ideas and share their thoughts, highlighting the importance of understanding our own nature and motivations in the pursuit of technology and progress. The speaker concludes by expressing gratitude for the shared intellectual journey and encourages a collaborative exploration of these complex issues, hoping that our collective endeavors can be nourishing and regenerative rather than self-destructive.

Checking Avabava 4 ： Undividualizer.txt
1. **Soul as Relationship**: The concept of a soul is not a possession but a way of being in relationship. It encompasses one's history, origin, life experiences, and connections with the environment, other beings, and oneself. A soul is a flowing aspect of existence, a pattern within the vast web of relationships on Earth.

2. **Conservatorship of Soulfulness**: Individuals have the role of conservator or steward of their own capacity for soulfulness, which is an expression of grace in a vibrant and alive environment. This capacity allows one to engage in inventing and enacting soulful experiences.

3. **Intellect as Travel**: Similarly, the intellect is not a static possession but a vehicle for travel, capable of engaging with dimensions that are more than just intelligent thought. It too has its own form of existence and travel beyond our usual understanding.

4. **Contextual Identity Formation**: People do not fully become themselves until they are given a context in which they can authentically personate. The way we are depicted and must depict ourselves as people is often influenced by cultural overlays that can obscure true personation.

5. **Therapy and Impersonation**: Therapy sometimes struggles with the distinction between impersonating a person and genuinely becoming one, reflecting the complexity of identity formation.

6. **Qualities as Potential**: Many qualities associated with individuals are actually potentials that remain hidden until an appropriate context emerges to bring them forth. This raises questions about what we see when we observe people, as these observations might be capturing symptoms of the absence of these qualities.

7. **Creating Authentic Contexts**: By creating contexts that are authentic, challenging, and cooperative, individuals can discover what it means to be an individual and to be part of a collective that is noble and true. These contexts should also be ecologically intimate to foster a deeper connection with the natural world.

8. **Becoming Noble Collectives**: The ultimate goal may be to become more like the wonderful exceptions already observed, where individuals and collectives stand in violation of harmful or destructive societal norms, promoting a more holistic and life-affirming existence.

Checking Averoigne 17.txt
 The passage reflects a critical view of how contemporary human collectives—including political systems, religions, and even scientific institutions—often fail to represent the true essence of humanity, intellect, souls, and spirit. These collectives are perceived as being based on fictions rather than genuine truths or noble purposes. They prioritize their own survival and profit over the well-being and development of individuals and the environment. The author argues that these collectives operate with a duplicitous nature, presenting a public face that promotes well-being while privately pursuing self-serving goals, often at the expense of the planet's ecological health and the integrity of life.

The current state of human collectives is seen as inadequate, as they do not provide meaningful roles for individuals to express their humanity and intelligence. Instead, people are encouraged to accept superficial replacements for genuine connection and purpose. This situation is particularly dire when considering environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity, which are often overlooked or treated as mere assets to be exploited.

The author suggests that the only viable solution is to create new human collectives based on authentic intelligence, genuine mutual support, and a commitment to noble purposes. These new collectives should be grounded in the true potential of humanity, our role within nature, and the principles of mutuality rather than profit or dogma. The transformation towards such enlightened collectives should be achieved through positive example and superior alternatives, rather than conflict or opposition. The author expresses a hope for a future where these new collectives become so compelling that they render previous, fictional systems obsolete.

Checking Awake.txt
1. **Awakening Together**: The conversation reflects on the possibility of collectively awakening from the "darkness of our modernity" to a state of greater insight, intelligence, and playfulness. The speaker invokes the idea of little practices that can lead us to a more enlightened state.

2. **Divine Beings and Souls**: The distinction is made between our souls and our bodies, emphasizing that souls are eternal and profound entities existing beyond time and space, where separation is provisional and intimacy is prevalent.

3. **Pareidolia**: In the context of darkness, the speaker discusses pareidolia—the psychological phenomenon of perceiving meaningful patterns or images in random data—and how it can inform our interpretation of our surroundings, which can be both comforting and unsettling depending on our intentions and fears.

4. **Personal Experience with Divinity**: The speaker recounts a time when they felt constantly accompanied by an angel, experiencing unconditional love and profound insights that were validated in reality. This memory serves as a benchmark for the speaker's aspirations and understanding of their own potential and divine gifts.

5. **Divine Reflections in Human Constructs**: The speaker suggests that human-made objects, behaviors, and actions are symbolic representations of something transcendental. These reflections have been so distorted by our ordinary experiences that we often fail to recognize their true significance.

6. **Life Beyond Humans**: The conversation highlights the idea that humans are not the most intelligent beings on earth and that life itself is a consequence of greater cosmic forces, including the presence of the sun and the moon.

7. **Communion with the Divine**: The speaker acknowledges that while some individuals may have authentic experiences of divine communion, many will view such claims as delusions. The conversation underscores the difficulty in distinguishing between genuine spiritual experiences and mere delusion.

8. **Farewell and Wish for Awakening**: The speaker concludes by wishing the audience awakening and wonder, beauty, joy, understanding, companionship, and communion, and invites listeners to reflect on these themes until they meet again.

Checking Awareness & The Nonverbal Aspects of Sensemaking.txt
1. In this video, Jordan Peterson discusses the human desire to dispel delusions and the risk of living in ignorance if we magicalize everything or fail to imagine a world where something like magic could be real. He emphasizes the importance of both rational sobriety and an open, curious mind that is willing to explore and accept the mysteries of reality without being blinded by them.

Checking Balance： Between Prehension and Cognition.txt
 The discussion revolves around the concept of consciousness and the specialized aspects of human consciousness that develop with education, training, or experience in various fields such as music, poetry, literature, medicine, engineering, and exploration. These specialized crusts of knowledge represent highly developed forms of expression and understanding within their respective domains.

The narrator emphasizes the importance of preserving the diverse and creative aspects of our minds throughout the process of becoming educated, which often involves in-languaging and cultural adaptation. Artists, musicians, and performers are highlighted as individuals who challenge and rejuvenate these crusts by provoking deeper self-reflection and emotional exploration in their audiences.

The narrator expresses a deep sense of privilege and insight gained from their own education and experiences with life, knowledge, and understanding. They also recognize the fundamental social nature of humans, emphasizing an underlying unity that transcends individual consciousness. This unity is described as non-conceptual and beyond current scientific models.

The narrator acknowledges that humans are fascinated by the idea of extraterrestrial life (aliens) but fails to recognize that each human is, in a sense, an "alien" arriving from beyond—a reference to our biological origins as well as the broader, transcendental experiences we undergo.

Finally, the narrator references John Carpenter and his colleague Dean Raiden, both of whom suggest there's something profoundly deeper than the conscious mind that current scientific models struggle to explain. The narrator uses the analogy of flowers in the grass resembling stars in the sky to illustrate the emergence of thoughts from an originating depth within the mind.

In summary, the narrative is a reflection on the nature of human consciousness, the importance of creativity and education, the role of artists in rejuvenating our minds, and the recognition of a deeper, unifying aspect of existence that transcends individual consciousness and current scientific explanations.

Checking Bees, Cars, Angles, Angels ： Gaps & Structure.txt
 In this thought-provoking and insightful monologue, Paulin discusses the profound connection between honey bees and human intelligence within the context of nature and the environment. He emphasizes that honey bees act as intelligent angels, connecting beings across a hyper-intelligent network, which can be seen as analogous to neural networks in the human brain. Paulin points out that modern technology, like cars and the internet, is disrupting these natural networks, leading to the decline of both biodiversity and human cognitive capabilities.

He draws parallels between the way bees interact with their environment and the way neurons inform the space between them in a human brain, suggesting that our current technologies are not intelligent in the same way because they do not engage with the spaces they inhabit as respectfully or sustainably as bees do. Paulin encourages listeners to reflect on how structure influences space in both natural and technological realms and to consider the implications of this for our future actions and decisions.

The underlying message is a call to recognize the importance of living in harmony with nature, valuing intelligence that respects and works within the existing fabric of life, rather than imposing upon it destructively. Paulin invites us to rethink our approach to technology and our role as stewards of the planet, emphasizing the potential for a more intelligent and interconnected way of living that benefits both humans and the natural world.

6. He concludes by expressing gratitude to his audience for their companionship and looks forward to future interactions, signing off with a warm farewell.

Checking Beliefs vs Insight ： The Negotiation of Identity.txt
1. The narrative of a child being offered three wishes by beings in the sky serves as an allegory for how we interact with intelligent entities or forces, whether they are perceived as angels or demons.
   
2. The key to positive interactions with these intelligences lies not in demanding power, wealth, and comfort, but in recognizing and embodying benevolence towards all beings.
   
3. Every interaction has a "handshake" phase where both parties assess each other's intentions and the nature of the relationship is determined. This is evident even in interactions with animals or pets.
   
4. Selfish desires are problematic, while genuine concern for the welfare and progress of all beings is associated with benevolence.

Checking Birdwalking： Forms of Awareness (Waking⧸Dreaming⧸Trance⧸Language).txt
 In this conversation, the speaker reflects on the nature of consciousness, likening it to the flow and movement of water or atmosphere. They emphasize the importance of resurrecting the pre-linguistic imagination of childhood, which is akin to the concept of Abel in the bible, representing an originary mind that exists before the overlay of language and representation. The speaker discusses how individuals with such innate intelligence and creativity—musicians, artists, dancers, poets, orators, etc.—often face challenges within a culture that may not understand or appreciate their gifts. These individuals can either be celebrated and thus become part of the culture's narrative (which can be dangerous) or attacked by it as a threat to the established order.

The speaker points out that even historical figures like Jesus, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lennon, and potentially John F. Kennedy embodied this originary consciousness, which makes them targets for destruction by the powers that be. The current political landscape in the United States is highlighted as an example of commodification overtaking value and meaning, with a leader who represents the "lethal forgetting" of our supercultures.

The speaker also notes the importance of moments of truthfulness and the essence of light and rhythm found in natural phenomena like sunrise or sunset. They express gratitude for the opportunity to engage in this dialogue and encourage the audience to find meaning, beauty, and truth in their own lives, perhaps inspiring them to share these insights with others.

The conversation concludes with a heartfelt farewell, emphasizing the value of shared learning and reflection, and thanking the audience for their participation.

Checking Blue 17： Where are qualities？ Superstars..txt
 Your idea posits that qualities are not inherent in individuals but emerge from the interplay between individuals and their environment and relationships. The concept of an individual as a "nucleation" point suggests that these qualities develop over time through interactions and within specific contexts. This view challenges the notion that exceptional individuals, like Albert Einstein, are simply born or produced in isolation; instead, it argues that they arise from a confluence of urgent engagement on a problem or issue among a group of capable minds.

The essay reflects on why we do not consistently produce figures like Einstein despite having the capability to do so in the past. It suggests that contemporary cultural pressures and misconceptions about intelligence and social dynamics have led us to believe that extraordinary achievements are the sole result of exceptional individuals, rather than recognizing the importance of collaborative effort and context. The absence of similar figures today may be due to a lack of urgency or shared focus on critical issues within supportive environments, which are necessary for such "superpositions" of intelligence to emerge.

Furthermore, the expectation for heroes or leaders to deliver solutions has possibly deprived society of the understanding that becoming exceptional is part of our collective nature, especially when we work together. The essay implies that by waiting for external sources of inspiration or leadership, we have neglected the internal and collaborative efforts required to foster such remarkable achievements ourselves.

In summary, the argument suggests that both the development of individual qualities and the emergence of extraordinary accomplishments are deeply rooted in the relational contexts in which individuals are embedded. It calls for a reevaluation of how we approach intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of collective effort and supportive environments over individualism and competition.

Checking Calling Out Culture： A Toxic Divergence from The Potential for Mutual Excellence.txt
 In this talk, Jordan Peterson discusses the concept of children as ambassadors from the pre-embodied state of existence to the human world. He emphasizes that children, especially very young ones like his friend's one-year-old child, have an innate ability to embody and express the joy and wonder of being, which is often lost in adults due to cultural and societal conditioning.

Peterson posits that humans are naturally intelligent beings with a birthright far greater than what modern society typically offers or even acknowledges. He suggests that the actual nature of reality—time, space, and intelligence within these parameters—is so profound and beautiful that all human-created stories, ideas, and books combined pale in comparison.

He draws attention to the idea of crossing gaps as a fundamental aspect of life, where organisms continuously create new possibilities by bridging the space between one state and another. This can be seen in heartbeats, breaths, relationships, and personal growth.

Peterson reflects on how humans try to fill time with various activities, which he notes is a metaphorical way of navigating our understanding of time. He concludes by wishing the audience insight, enthusiasm, and all positive experiences in their endeavors, urging them to seek out the wonders and truths of life and to cross the many gaps they will encounter along the way.

The talk encourages listeners to recognize the inherent potential within themselves and to embrace the journey of discovering the true nature of reality, as well as their own role in the grand tapestry of existence.

Checking Casual analysis of Coyote⧸Magpie Feeding Video.txt
1. The video shows a coyote scouting a location where meat has been left, likely by humans, as evidenced by the tracks and snow conditions. The coyote is particularly concerned with ensuring that the area is safe before approaching the food.

2. The first coyote appears to be a scout or possibly a decoy, exhibiting a high level of vigilance and caution. It seems to have had previous encounters with humans, as it looks frightened and expectant of trouble.

3. The second coyote comes in after the initial scout has done its job. It takes a brief look around, ensuring the area is clear, grabs the meat, and then leaves without lingering.

4. Both the magpies and the first coyote produce startle responses when approaching the food, which may serve as a tactic to reveal any nearby predators or humans observing them.

5. The coyotes' behavior, particularly their preference for using one side (right side in this case), is indicative of lateralized brain function, which is common in animals and contributes to their ability to be vigilant and survive in human-dominated landscapes.

6. The video underscores the importance of observing animal behavior from a lateral perspective, noting which side they approach from, track from, and attack or defend from, as these can reveal much about their brain lateralization and behavior patterns.

7. The commentary encourages further exploration of similar videos to understand animal behavior better, especially the complexities of lateralization in their brains.

Checking Caterpillar.txt
ლᵍᴍᴍᵍ (L-O-M-O) is a playful expression often used in online communication, particularly within the Georgia Tech community. It's derived from the phrase "I'm so mad that my mom won't let me own monocle," but it's typically shortened to "Ửm sɔm ðæt mɪm wʊn't lɛt mɪ oʊn mʊnkəl." The phrase became a meme after being featured in the Georgia Tech student handbook under a section about acceptable student behavior.

The subsequent parts you've mentioned are variations or responses to the original LOMOMONCLE meme. "ლᵍᴍᴍᵍᵍ" (LOMOMOMOREMORE) is an extension of the original for comedic effect, and "ლᵍᵇėᶜᶅἜ xx" (LEMONPARTYxx) is a reference to a party that was famously crashed by students at Georgia Tech in 2015.

"ლᵊᴡɪsᴧʸᴏʟᴍᴇɴᴛᴀʟʟʏἜᶅ ᴅᴀᴅᴎᴅᴅᶅ ḅᴅ ḅỀxxxxx jeden ᴅᴅᴅᴅᴅ" (L-O-M-O-M-E-N-T-A-L-L-Y ᴅᴇᴡ ᴀᴅᴅ) and "ᴅᴅᴂ oppressed" are likely references to the meme being used in a different context, possibly to describe a situation where someone is metaphorically "oppressed" by rules or restrictions similar to the "LOMOMONCLE" rule.

In summary, these phrases and variations are part of an online meme culture originating from Georgia Tech's student handbook, which has since evolved into a broader in-joke within certain internet communities.

 Terence McKenna, in his speech "A Chat with Turn Away," discusses the importance of reconnecting with our humanity and the natural world. He criticizes the current state of society, where people have turned away from the deeper aspects of our humanity in favor of trivial and superficial concerns, which has made humanity a self-destructive force. McKenna emphasizes the need to recover our original authenticity, nobility, potential for intelligence, creativity, and beauty, despite the overwhelming forces that have led many contributions to these values to be statistically insignificant.

He suggests that the priority should be to invest in radical transformation and progress, which he believes has been misdirected throughout history. McKenna advocates for establishing small, intelligent, and proactive societies that function similarly to pods found in social mammals, where each member's unique skills and abilities enhance the group as a whole. He criticizes the concept of nations and calls for the creation of self-sufficient communities that can link together to achieve collective goals.

McKenna expresses hope that current circumstances may prompt the formation of such societies and shares his belief in the potential for humans to form meaningful relationships that are both ethically sound and beneficial for future generations. He believes that by doing so, we can create something new and positive that justifies the struggles of our ancestors and the investments of nature.

In conclusion, McKenna encourages a shift from focusing on trivial matters to investing in our true potential as human beings, ensuring that our habits, once shattered, can be reshaped into something meaningful and life-affirming. He leaves with a message of optimism, urging us to find the sacred relationship behind ordinary appearances, which will endure beyond any challenges we may face.

Checking Clothing and Color.txt
Your musings touch upon the complex interplay between human attire choices, animal behavior, and the broader ecological relationships. You've observed that your colorful clothing sometimes attracts bees, which made you consider why people, particularly women, might choose to wear bright or white colors. You speculate that these colors could serve a purpose beyond human attention—namely, to attract beneficial animals such as bees and birds, which can act as natural protectors and indicators of one's surroundings.

You propose that perhaps some individuals, both men and women, may unconsciously or intentionally dress in a way that is analogous to flowers attracting pollinators, creating a network of relationships and protections within the ecosystem. This perspective shifts the focus from human-centric reasons for wearing bright colors to a more ecological and interconnected viewpoint.

In essence, you're suggesting that humans might be engaging in a form of "floral signaling," which is not entirely dissimilar to how flowers signal to pollinators. This idea emphasizes the importance of considering our place within the natural world and how our actions and choices can influence and coexist with other species.

In summary, your reflections lead to an interesting hypothesis about the reasons behind colorful clothing choices in humans, connecting them to the broader ecological interactions that benefit both people and nature. It's a thought-provoking idea that encourages us to think more deeply about the purpose of our attire beyond its immediate aesthetic or social implications.

Checking Cognition： Thinking about misfortune.txt
1. The conversation explores the nature of human consciousness and cognition, focusing on how cultures and narratives can shape our perceptions and potentially limit our sensory experiences and mental landscapes.

2. The idea of "wild land in our minds" represents the untamed, imaginative, and psychic terrain from which meaning and identity emerge. This terrain can be suppressed or overpowered by dominant cultural narratives that are often simplistic and limiting.

3. The discussion touches on ancient practices of interpreting omens and portents, which reflect human fascination with the idea that events can carry significant meanings beyond their literal occurrences.

4. The speaker acknowledges the compulsion to believe in such interpretations, even when they are scientifically unfounded, and points out that the act of writing something down could, historically, imbue it with truth within its cultural context.

5. The conversation reflects on why bad things happen, noting that sometimes terrible events are not just happenstances but are actively executed by humans. It emphasizes the importance of using our faculties to understand and prevent these occurrences, free from the influence of superstition and unquestioned cultural beliefs.

6. The speaker calls for a re-examination and elevation of human consciousness, suggesting that together, we can develop these faculties in a way that is less influenced by delusion and more grounded in reality, leading to a better understanding of the world and our place within it.

7. The conversation concludes with an invitation for listeners to join in the pursuit of understanding and growth, and a hopeful sign-off encouraging future learning and discussion.

Checking Complaint and Blame or Change our World, Now, Together？.txt
1. The speaker emphasizes the importance of interconnectedness and unity among humans and with our ecosystems, suggesting that this is essential for our humanity and intelligence.

2. They describe a "pod" model where individuals are in constant communication and collaboration, resolving conflicts only to better everyone involved. This model avoids unnecessary combat and pretense, focusing on authenticity and the empowerment of moral and ethical identity.

3. The speaker criticizes superficial arguments and complains without solutions that worsen existing problems, such as ecological, economic, or ideological issues.

4. They suggest that we should learn from our disagreements and use them to become more intelligent collectively. The focus should be on finding solutions that restore our humanity, democracy, and liberation.

5. The speaker encourages the adoption of a standard of intelligent, connected dialogue and warns against arming ourselves with tough and scary language that only serves to frighten each other and detract from real progress.

6. They commend figures like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange for showing another direction and call for unity in discovery rather than adherence to rigid ideologies.

7. The speaker concludes with seasonal greetings and an invitation to engage with them further online at organelle.org or wondercloud.wordpress.com, wishing the audience all blessings.

Checking Con no tation.txt
1. **Ambiguity Aversion**: Humans tend to be uncomfortable with ambiguous situations, especially under stress. This discomfort can lead to a compulsion to resolve uncertainty by creating a crisis or disaster. The reason for this is that once a situation is clearly negative or catastrophic, the ambiguity is resolved and we have a clear understanding of what has happened.

2. **Decision-Making Challenges**: As animals, humans often struggle with making complex decisions as individuals. This is particularly true when faced with high levels of ambiguity and unknown outcomes.

3. **Responding to Stress**: When stress and ambiguity are present, the mind may default to a left hemispheric state that seeks to resolve uncertainty by creating problems or making poor choices, rather than remaining in a state of uncertainty or facing the discomfort it brings.

4. **Mindful Response**: Instead of reacting to ambiguity with fear and crisis creation, individuals can choose to remain calm, accept the lack of control, and gently let go of the need to resolve every unknown immediately. This approach often leads to better outcomes and a more peaceful state of mind.

The speaker encourages reflection on these tendencies and suggests that by acknowledging them, we can learn to respond to life's uncertainties with greater composure and resilience.

Checking Consciousness ｜ God.txt
 The discussion revolves around the nature of consciousness, awareness, and identity from both scientific (eliminative materialism) and spiritual perspectives. The speaker suggests that both views consider individual identity as a "figment" or an illusion—the scientists in a literal biological sense, and the spiritual traditions in a metaphysical dream-like sense. The key point is that while both approaches deny the separate self, they differ fundamentally in their implications.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of direct experience over relying solely on language, which can obscure our understanding of our true nature or origin. They compare the search for truth to wandering in a forest, with moments of clarity and profound understanding interspersed with periods of confusion and exploration.

The speaker also touches upon the human tendency to create systems (like laws and rules) to understand the universe, but these are ultimately human constructs that may not reflect the true nature of reality. They argue that science, in its current state, is fundamentally misguided because it lacks a proper starting point for understanding identity and consciousness.

The speaker expresses concern about humanity's catastrophically confused state, as evidenced by our destructive impact on the planet. However, they find hope in ancient spiritual traditions and the presence of wise individuals across all ages and cultures who understand the importance of living harmoniously with life.

The speaker invites the audience to join in learning together and to work towards becoming a source of hope themselves, aiming for wisdom, kindness, friendliness, and intelligence as we seek to understand and live in harmony with our true nature. They conclude by expressing gratitude for the company and looking forward to future conversations on these topics.

Checking Contact with Nonhuman Intelligence： VALIS and Beyond.txt
1. **Contact with the Non-Human Intelligence**: The speaker had an experience of profound communication with a non-human intelligence, which they describe as a companion. This entity was infinitely intelligent and transformed the speaker's own consciousness through their interaction.

2. **Orgasm and Water Analogies**: The speaker uses analogies to illustrate how it's impossible to fully understand certain experiences until you've had them, such as orgasm or swimming, just as it's difficult to describe the nature of their communication with the non-human intelligence.

3. **Religious Aspirations vs. Personal Experience**: The speaker acknowledges that religions often attempt to explain mysteries like birth, death, and the divine, but their experience is personal and distinct from religious narratives.

4. **The Importance of Relationships**: The speaker emphasizes that relationships can transform us, just as their connection with this intelligence transformed them. They also hint at the potential for humans to develop a direct relationship with something greater than ourselves.

5. **Crisis of Our Species**: The speaker believes humanity is in crisis and may not survive, but they are hopeful that the living planet, if we learn to relate to it non-verbally and non-conceptually, can guide us beyond our current limitations.

6. **Living Beings as Connections**: The speaker suggests that living beings on Earth serve as connections between material form and something beyond, acting as receivers and transmitters of intelligence both within and outside time and space.

7. **Encouragement for Exploration**: The speaker encourages those interested to explore these ideas further through direct experience and research, hoping to retrieve a lost relationship that could be beneficial for humanity and the Earth.

8. **The Great Silence of Nature**: The speaker finds clues in the silence and mystery of nature, which they believe can lead us beyond our current understanding if we learn to relate to it in a non-verbal, non-conceptual way.

9. **A Call for Collaboration**: The speaker invites the audience to join them in this exploration, to potentially rediscover an old relationship that could have profound implications for the future of life on Earth.

Checking Controlling Nature, Pandemic Ignorance, Categories, and Visiting the Bath House.txt
1. **Self-Perception and Identity**: Darren Aronofsky discusses his comfort with creative, intellectual minds and his identity as a man who is both masculine and feminine in nature. He trusts others to form their own perspectives of him rather than dictating how he should be perceived.

2. **Social Expectations**: He shares his experiences of discomfort around gay women who were upset by his masculinity, contrasting with his comfort around gay men. He acknowledges the societal expectations that lead people to make assumptions about someone's sexuality based on their location or presentation.

3. **Marketing and Advertising**: Darren reflects on how marketing effectively creates desire and then fulfills it, citing his neighbor Steve as an example of organic advertising with Pringles chips. He also touches on a more sinister marketing strategy that delivers an extraordinary experience the first time and then consistently underdelivers to create ongoing demand based on nostalgia.

4. **Darren's Product**: Darren teases a product he's working on, emphasizing its enigmatic nature, and humorously suggests it's something people won't miss because it's priceless and indescribable, playing with the idea of creating desire without a clear object or cost.

5. **Closing Remarks**: Darren wraps up the episode by expressing gratitude to his listeners for their support, wishing them well, and inviting them to look forward to future collaborative learning experiences. He ends with a note of irony, acknowledging the paradoxical nature of his message about insight and loving kindness from others.

Checking Cooking with Steve.txt
This is a transcript of a humorous and lightly inebriated group interaction where they are cooking together on a Friday night. The group is preparing steak, potatoes, and garlic bread. The cook, Steve, is multitasking between grilling the steak, cooking the potatoes, and preparing the garlic bread. One member of the group spills part of their drink, acknowledging it's an indelicate mistake as a guest at a neighbor's house. The group banters about the cooking process, Steve's skills, and the ingredients used. They make jokes about redneck cooking, secret recipes, and even physical threats over differing opinions on the cooking process. Despite the humor and distractions, Steve successfully cooks the steak and potatoes to the group's approval. The conversation ends with a toast to Steve's cooking skills and a reminder that the names have been changed to protect privacy, likely for the YouTube video that will document the evening.

Checking Coot Combat at Stow Lake.txt
 In this conversation, we observed a dynamic interaction between coots at Stow Lake, which provided an opportunity to discuss the complex nature of social hierarchies and conflicts within animal behavior. The coots were engaged in a territorial or mating display that involved aggressive posturing, such as raising wings and tails, and vocalizations to establish dominance. This behavior is not only confined to this specific event but can also spread to other individuals, suggesting a contagious nature of emotional states and social interactions.

The discussion then expanded to include human parallels, particularly the phenomenon of organized combat as exemplified by Conor McGregor's fight night. This event draws the attention of millions, indicating how humans create spectacles around conflict resolution, which often serves as a means to maintain social order in the face of personal and social identity pressures.

The conversation also touched upon the potential risks and rewards associated with sudden fame or wealth, as these can disrupt one's life by placing them in contexts they may not be equipped to handle. The point was made that the artificial environments humans create can lead to unpredictable outcomes when individual circumstances change dramatically.

In essence, the interaction at Stow Lake served as a springboard for a broader reflection on the social behaviors and emotional contagion seen in both animal and human societies, highlighting the complexities of maintaining equilibrium within the constructed realities we inhabit.

Checking Cormorant 31 ： What is Identity？.txt
1. **Critique of Identity and Language**: Ken Wilber emphasizes the importance of questioning our preconceived notions of identity and language, highlighting that these frameworks can both guide and mislead us. He encourages a skeptical approach to what we think we know about the world, including ourselves, as these understandings are often rooted in cultural narratives and linguistic constructs that do not reflect reality as it truly is.

2. **The Limits of Science and Religion**: Both science and religion, while claiming to offer authentic knowledge and authority, are shown to have their own limitations and contradictions. Science can reshape our understanding of identity, and religion often imposes its own delimiting views on what it means to be human.

3. **The True Nature of Reality**: Wilber suggests that the nature of reality is far beyond what any culture, religion, or science has described. It is a living world that is intelligent, alive, and present, and it surpasses even our most imaginative fantasies or fears.

4. **The Source of Consciousness**: Our minds and consciousness are not entirely understood by us, and they have aspects that are beyond language and thought. This source of consciousness is pure and true, and much like the heart, it remains largely undiscovered within our own selves.

5. **The Importance of Doubt**: Wilber encourages doubt as a means to open up new ways of understanding identity and reality. By doubting what we believe things are, we can begin to see the world in a new light, which can transform our intelligence and the way we interact with it.

6. **Dreams vs. Thinking**: Wilber suggests that the true relationship with identity is more akin to dreaming than to thinking. Dreams have a vitality and diversity of intelligent beauty that are unavailable in our ordinary waking consciousness, which is often constrained by language and memory.

7. **Encouragement for Exploration**: Finally, Wilber invites individuals to explore the true nature of identity and reality, encouraging them to look deeply into how we understand the world and ourselves. By doing so, one might discover a profoundly different and more accurate understanding of what it means to exist.

In essence, Ken Wilber's message is one of open-minded inquiry, urging us to transcend our cultural and linguistic limitations to perceive the true nature of reality and our place within it.

Checking Creation Story Image by Wayne Rector.txt
 The narrative you've shared is a Cree creation myth from North America, which explains the origins of life, humanity, and the natural world. According to this myth:

1. A woman fell from the sky and was carried by geese until she landed on a turtle's back.
2. The turtle consulted other animals to retrieve dirt to grow land, which became known as Turtle Island or North America.
3. The woman gave birth to twin boys who embodied the concepts of yin and yang, good and evil.
4. One boy, representing good, was born first but his mischievous brother emerged from his mother's side first, leading to her death.
5. From their mother's body grew the three sisters—squash, beans, and corn—a staple in many Native American diets.
6. Tobacco, which is used for spiritual purposes, came from her heart.
7. The good brother, known as the right-handed son, created all beneficial things for humans, including tools and domesticated animals like bees.
8. The left-handed brother, representing evil, created predators, mosquitoes, and other nuisances that trouble humans.
9. A major fight between the two brothers resulted in the good brother winning and banishing his mischievous brother to the night sky.
10. The good brother placed his mother's head in the night sky as the moon (Grandmother Moon) and her body in the ocean, where it became all the fish.
11. Native cultures view the earth as a living being and consider themselves caretakers rather than owners of the land.
12. The story is to be represented in a mural, which will serve as an artistic and cultural expression of this creation myth. The mural will be dynamic, with different stories depicted on each wall, and will be photographed and documented for future generations.

This myth underscores the deep spiritual connection that many Native American cultures have with the earth and its elements, emphasizing stewardship over ownership and highlighting the duality of good and evil in the natural world and human nature.

1. **Poetic Codons**: These are the foundational or trigger phrases that set the tone for the ensuing narrative or thought process. They are not merely literal codes but serve as symbolic starting points for a cascade of associated meanings and ideas.

2. **Anticipation and Receptivity**: The mention of nine turtles suggests a state of receptive anticipation, a readiness to engage with the codons once they are introduced.

3. **Invisible Topologies**: The desire for the deeper, hidden meanings within words to become apparent, indicating a quest for understanding beyond the surface level.

4. **Conscious Awareness**: A call for awareness of the inner workings of consciousness and the interplay between perception, reality, and the self.

5. **Symbolic Imagery**: The passage uses specific images, like bulldogs, smoke, fingers combing hair, and clouds reflecting on water, to evoke emotions and thoughts that are not bound by literal interpretation.

6. **Tragic Social Membrane**: A metaphor for societal issues or the human condition, which is torn and complex, much like a tragic and fibrous membrane.

7. **Loss and Memory**: The attempt to piece together something that has been broken or lost, and the power of memory, as seen in the reflection on the first lucid nodule.

8. **The Impossible Made Possible**: A recognition that some things deemed impossible can be achieved through unconventional means or through a shift in perspective.

9. **Ancestral Wisdom**: The idea that wisdom and insight can be inherited from one's ancestors, as if by spinning the wheel of their tongues.

10. **Reflection and Resemblance**: The passage reflects on the nature of reflections, both literal and metaphorical, emphasizing the importance of seeing beyond surface appearances to grasp deeper truths.

Overall, the passage is a poetic exploration of consciousness, memory, societal issues, and the search for meaning, with an emphasis on the power of language and symbolism to convey complex ideas and emotions. It invites the reader to engage in a deep contemplation of reality and the self.

Checking Cypher 3： The Sky, The Garden, The Construct： Portals.txt
 The passage you've shared presents an esoteric perspective on the nature of life, consciousness, and the human experience. It suggests that the flowers in a garden are not just physical entities but also portals to the origins of life and our own inner consciousness. These portals represent a deeper aspect of ourselves that we are familiar with in dreams but often ignore or are unaware of in waking life. This aspect is akin to a "butterfly" in the metaphorical sense, representing the fluid, changing nature of our true selves and our potential for growth and evolution beyond the physical realm.

The narrative draws parallels between human genitalia and flowers as entry points or compasses for our fundamental drives and encounters, which underpin our culture and language. It posits that our relationship with these "flowers" is foundational to understanding ourselves and our connection to the universe.

The passage also critiques how human cultures have tried to suppress or misunderstand this aspect of ourselves, leading to environmental damage like the poisoning of pollens, which are likened to the carriers of consciousness or life's intelligence. The true purpose of our existence, according to this viewpoint, is to recognize and flow into this inner self, which is akin to being a flower oneself, and to remember our connection to the source of our minds and languages.

Ultimately, the passage suggests that when we truly understand the significance of flowers as portals, we will gain profound insights into ourselves and our place in the universe, potentially transforming our lives and making traditional storytelling or book-writing less relevant due to the direct experience of living these truths.

Checking Daemons.txt
1. **The Gravity of Habits**: Ken Wilber discusses how under stress, people tend to fall back into well-worn patterns or habits that can be detrimental to their well-being. This is akin to the gravitational pull towards familiar, yet undesirable, behaviors.

2. **Resisting Habits**: It's difficult to simply not think about a problematic habit because our minds have grooves that make it easy to slip into those patterns. The instinctive response is often to fight against the thought, which can be ineffective and stressful.

3. **Creating New Patterns**: Instead of resisting the urge, Wilber suggests creating a positive alternative action when we recognize the onset of an unwanted habit. This could be any activity that we enjoy and that fulfills us, serving as a diversion from the negative pattern.

4. **Changing the Environment**: By consistently choosing beautiful and meaningful actions, we can change the 'space' within us, filling it with positive experiences that make the old, negative habits less compelling over time. This is similar to how ecological niches work—if the environment changes, different patterns emerge.

5. **Practice and Liberation**: Changing habits and thought patterns requires practice. By noticing the 'gravity' of our instincts and choosing a different path, we can experience moments of liberation and increased freedom from the patterns that no longer serve us.

6. **Continuous Learning**: Wilber encourages ongoing exploration and learning with others, emphasizing the importance of community in personal growth and transformation.

In summary, Ken Wilber emphasizes the importance of not just resisting negative habits but actively creating positive alternatives to change the 'space' within us. This leads to a reduction in the power of those habits and contributes to our overall well-being and liberation from patterns that no longer serve us.

Checking Darkness.txt
1. **Finding Light in Darkness**: The discussion revolves around the concept of seeking and finding a different kind of light within situations that appear dark or negative. This is not about ignoring the reality of a grim situation, like a car crash, but rather about recognizing that there can be beauty and significance in the darkness itself.

2. **Shifting Perspectives**: The idea is to shift our focus from looking for physical light during times of crisis to learning to see in the dark, metaphorically speaking. This means looking beyond our usual reactions to stress or tragedy to find deeper meaning and purpose.

3. **The Role of Habits and Comfort Zones**: Our habits can become like gravitational forces that hold us back from changing or growing. By consciously working to break free from these habits, we can discover new ways of being and new insights.

4. **Collaboration in Dark Times**: Facing challenges together can provide a clearer understanding of what's happening, as a group of people can pool their perspectives and insights more effectively than an individual.

5. **The Transformative Nature of Crisis**: The transformations that occur during times of crisis, whether it be from joy to fear, calm to anger, or habit to crisis, are opportunities for personal growth. However, these transformations often require a shift in awareness and the ability to focus on different aspects of our experience.

6. **Personal Experience**: The speaker shares their own experience of "fishing in the darkness," having explored the deeper layers of meaning and existence that exist beyond our superficial perceptions. They invite others to join them in this pursuit, offering hope that there is indeed light to be found even in the most challenging circumstances.

In essence, the conversation encourages us to look beyond the immediate appearance of situations to find the underlying beauty and wisdom that can only be revealed by a change in perspective and an openness to see what lies hidden in the darkness.

Checking Death.txt
1. **Consciousness as a Collective Being**: The speaker suggests that we are not just individual beings but also part of a collective consciousness that transcends time, space, and even worlds. Our existence is a "local instance" of a broader, interconnected reality.

2. **Fear of Death**: Most people fear death because they believe they are losing their individual self, which seems fragile and localized to this body and mind. However, the speaker invites us to consider that what we perceive as dying might be just a transformation or a shift in the form of presence.

3. **Memory**: The speaker points out that memory is not a single phenomenon but has many forms, from thread memory to dream memory, insight memory, and more. This diversity challenges the simple notion of memory as a recording device.

4. **The Self and Fear**: The speaker questions who the self is that is afraid of death and what exactly we fear. The discussion delves into the nature of the self and the fear associated with it.

5. **Dreaming and Health**: The speaker touches on various philosophical perspectives on dreaming, suggesting that it could be indicative of a state of health or illness, and implies a potential connection between dreaming, waking states, birth, and death.

6. **Exploration and Learning**: The speaker encourages the audience to expand their curiosity and passion for learning about these profound topics—death, birth, dreaming, and waking—and how they are interrelated in ways that often elude our understanding.

7. **Conclusion**: The speaker concludes by expressing gratitude for the shared exploration of these themes and looks forward to continuing the dialogue in future learning sessions. The speaker signs off, inviting the audience to reflect on these ideas and join in transforming their perspectives through collective inquiry.

Checking Declaration vs Invitation： the keys to intelligence.txt
1. **The Problem with Declarative Models**: Declarative models like "I am a writer" or "I will be successful" can become limiting beliefs that stifle growth and learning. They create a fixed identity that doesn't allow for the fluidity of life's possibilities.

2. **Inviting vs. Declaring**: Instead of declaring a fixed identity, it's more beneficial to invite what you want into your life. Invitation is dynamic, allowing you to respond intelligently to the world around you without being constrained by past declarations.

3. **The Benefits of Inviting**: By inviting, you can think more freely, be less afraid of the future, and use your energy for positive development rather than defending outdated models. This leads to a more open, learning-oriented mind that is capable of detecting and assisting others with similar issues.

4. **Transforming Habits**: The habits associated with the declarative model are often negative, aggressive, and domineering, and they can be transformed into positive, forward-moving habits when you shift to inviting.

5. **Personal and Cultural Growth**: Individually, this shift allows for significant personal growth and the addition of new insights and intelligence. Collectively, it can lead to the creation of new cultures with a strong forward learning momentum.

6. **Changing the World**: With these insights, there is potential to change anything harmful in history and to never again play the victim role or waste energy defending outdated positions. This approach empowers us to love life and each other more fully.

7. **Looking Forward**: By facing forward into the invitation, we become conductors of our own lives, guiding our experiences rather than being prisoners of them. This is an exciting possibility for personal and collective transformation.

8. **Conclusion**: The invitation to face forward is a call to action that encourages growth, learning, and positive change, leading to a more vibrant and fulfilling life and the potential to influence culture and society for the better.

Checking Delicacy.txt
1. The conversation touches upon the concept of "delicacy" within us, which is akin to the hidden and delicate aspects of nature that are often overlooked or ignored in the face of flashy and showy external displays.

2. The example of people buying expensive trucks is used to illustrate how we often create elaborate and costly external displays to showcase our inner qualities, but sometimes these displays can be intimidating or frightening to the delicate aspects within us that we are trying to express.

3. The narrative shifts to a real-life scenario where a person rescued a child who had climbed onto an escalator rail in a mall. The rescuer's actions were not seen as heroic by himself; he simply did what needed to be done because he was there.

4. The discussion then explores the idea that when we act from our deepest, most authentic place (our delicacy), the world around us and our own nature can transform in profound ways. This can manifest in simple everyday actions like offering a genuine smile or walking with a sense of beauty.

5. The speaker emphasizes the importance of creating situations where our delicacies can emerge and be experienced together, rather than just celebrating them as an abstract concept.

6. The speaker suggests that we often create symbolic representations of authentic experiences through events like holidays or sports events, which are second-order activities compared to the first-order experience of living authentically.

7. The conversation concludes with a call to action to bring our delicacies to life together and to learn how to walk in beauty as a collective, starting from this moment of shared reflection. The speaker thanks the audience for joining in this exploration of self and community.

Checking Desire ： Aversion ｜ The Problem With Nouns.txt
00 is reflecting on the consequences of a culture saturated with nouns and objects, which he suggests leads to a "living death" where individuals lose their sense of direct experience and participation in the interconnected nature of all things. This cultural phenomenon, according to 00, began in the Garden of Eden story, where the act of gaining knowledge through naming created a division from the natural state of interbeing. He posits that nouns, by their very nature, create static and isolated representations of reality, which is inherently dynamic and relational.

00 argues that our language has developed in a way that doesn't adequately express the profound and miraculous nature of existence, the ecstatic oneness from which all beings and ecologies emerge. Instead, our language imposes a world of separated distinct things, objects, moments, and transactions, each carrying implied values that often go unnoticed or are ignored as we navigate life through the lens of names, categories, and catalogues.

He suggests that becoming aware of this issue is the first step toward reclaiming the degrees of liberty lost and preventing further entrapment in a world defined by these static identities. 00 encourages a deeper understanding of the problems with nouns and the importance of recognizing the true nature of light as a symbol for the astonishing modes of being that give rise to our minds, relationships, and the living world around us.

In essence, 00 is advocating for a shift in perception from one where we see a collection of isolated objects and identities to one where we recognize the fundamental interconnectedness of all things, an awareness that could lead to greater liberation and a more profound understanding of the nature of existence. He concludes by acknowledging the transition from day to night and invites listeners to continue exploring these ideas in their dreams as the day comes to a close.

Checking Disambiguation： The Immune System, Police and Societal Analogies.txt
1. The conversation begins with an acknowledgment of the complex and often disturbing realities underlying our society, which are typically obscured by layers of societal narratives and fictions.

2. The speaker suggests that it's crucial to confront these uncomfortable truths about the systemic violence, inequality, and injustice inherent in many aspects of our nation, including government, military, court systems, police forces, and the corporate world.

3. There is a call for small-scale change, starting with personal interactions and forming tight-knit groups that operate intelligently and ethically, similar to how humans naturally form social pods.

4. The speaker emphasizes the importance of recognizing that our current system was not designed to serve or protect citizens but rather to oppress and exploit for profit and power.

5. The ultimate goal is to transform this system into one that truly serves and protects individuals, with an understanding that this will be a complex process requiring collective effort.

6. The speaker expresses a vision of a future society that is more intelligent than our current technologies, humane, noble, and worthy of pride for both our ancestors and our descendants.

7. The conversation closes with the speaker's hope that by sharing perspectives and working together, we can create meaningful change and a society we can all be proud of.

Checking Disambiguation： The Waking Mind’s Power is its Achilles Heel.....txt
1. The process of educating children involves stripping away the ambiguity of their initial experiences of the world, which is a loss of their more profound and imaginative engagement with reality.

2. Adults often seek to recapture this lost wonder through play, enchantment, or intoxicants due to feeling deprived of role, meaning, and adventure in their adult lives. This can lead to tragic compromises and a reliance on substances that only mimic true joy and motivation.

3. Addiction, including in children, is a serious issue exacerbated by the modern context, which is heavily influenced by technology and often leads to a dissociation from human relationships.

4. Corporations exploit this technological mediation to manipulate individuals emotionally, psychologically, and financially through targeted advertising and profiles.

5. The relationship with machines has become pervasive, often occupying the space between human interactions, which is a troubling development with potentially detrimental outcomes.

6. Nature itself contains both identity and ambiguity, and it is crucial to recognize that our linguistic habits can deprive us of true intelligence and freedom.

7. The representational intelligence that we are taught as children has profound impacts on our ability to forge meaningful, noble societies together. We often settle for the premade tokens and representations that society presents to us instead of seeking out the infinite possibilities that truly lie at hand.

8. There is a call to become conscious of the powers and capacities we are born with and to recognize how societal norms and habits can limit our potential for intelligence, nobility, and purpose as human beings.

9. A final reflection on the importance of awakening to our collective potential, standing together, and moving in a direction that honors the true intelligence and nobility of which we are capable. The speaker concludes with a note about an observation related to a beehive in a tree, signaling the end of this particular discourse.

Checking Distinction ｜ Reunion.txt
1. The conversation touches upon the idea of reunion, not competition, and the noble aspects of human relationships and ancestral gifts.

Checking Dreaming & Awareness ⧸ Novelty in Relation.txt
 In this video, Alan Watts discusses the nature of dreaming and its relation to consciousness, death, and the use of psychedelics. He highlights that in dreams, our perception is different from waking life—it's a direct experience of the formations of our own awareness, where what we see is deeply intertwined with how we feel. He suggests that if we could replicate this state of feeling seeing while awake, we might transcend everyday consciousness and the self-identity that is often altered in dreams.

Watts points out that psychedelics can induce a similar feeling seeing, but he distinguishes between this drug-induced state and the authentic experience of non-ordinary perception that arises naturally. He shares that his most profound experiences have been without drugs, emphasizing that such states can be dangerous but also vital and virtuous.

He encourages viewers to explore the expanded senses and perceptions that are natural to humanity but often suppressed by our common waking state. Watts concludes by expressing gratitude for the audience's attention and interest in these topics, hoping they might find ways to expand their waking experiences and appreciate the non-ordinary faculties of consciousness.

Watts' message is a call to embrace the full spectrum of human experience, including the transformative potential of dreaming and other altered states of consciousness. He invites us to consider the diversity of death as a continuation of life's play and training, encouraging an attitude of curiosity and openness towards the mysteries of existence.

Checking Dreaming (2)： Explorations.txt
1. **Bridging the Gap Between Dreaming and Waking Consciousness**: Engaging in meaningful conversations about dreams while awake can help bridge the gap between the two states of consciousness. Some cultures traditionally share dreams upon waking, which is a beneficial practice.

2. **Dream Sharing and Recording**: Discussing and recording dreams can catalyze personal awakening and discovery. This process not only helps us remember our dreams but also indicates to the dreaming mind that we are paying attention.

3. **Consciousness Across States**: The dreaming consciousness is curious about the waking world, just as our waking consciousness is intrigued by the dreaming world. How we interact with these states of consciousness can influence their responsiveness.

4. **Honoring Consciousness**: Reverence, curiosity, and passion towards these different aspects of consciousness can lead them to pay more attention. Ignoring them, conversely, may result in less engagement.

5. **Communicating with the Dreaming Mind**: While awake, we can communicate with our dreaming mind through various means, including non-verbal methods like drawing, dancing, or singing. Alternatively, speaking to the dreaming mind from a place deep within the belly can be particularly effective.

7. **Desire for Transformation**: The hope is that dreams will not only be fascinating experiences but also transformative, educational, and rich in insight. Engaging with our dreams can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of both the dreaming and waking worlds.

Checking Dreaming and the Origins of Formal Waking Consciousness.txt
1. **Dreaming's Role**: Terence McKenna discusses how modern life, saturated with screens and technology, might be impacting our dreaming lives. He suggests that our exposure to external representations can inhibit and potentially damage natural dreaming faculties, which were once integral to our humanity.

2. **Modernity as Amputation**: McKenna views many aspects of modern life as a series of "amputations," where we've lost fundamental abilities and relationships in exchange for conveniences and technologies. He laments the loss of direct experiences and faculties that were once natural to us, such as telepathy and shared dreaming.

3. **Recovering Lost Faculties**: McKenna advocates for a renaissance where we recover lost aspects of our interiority and intelligence, particularly those related to our dreaming consciousness. He believes that our waking minds often dominate and submerge the more profound faculties of our dreaming minds.

4. **Progress Revisited**: McKenna redefines what he considers true progress—an ever-deepening understanding and access to the fundamental nature of our consciousness, humanity, and interiority. He criticizes what we commonly refer to as "progress" as either a disease or a digression from this deeper state of being.

5. **Personal and Collective Quest**: He emphasizes that the answers to these complex questions about consciousness and dreaming are not known and must be explored through personal and collective inquiry, with reverence for the living world and its inherent intelligence.

6. **The Future**: McKenna invites us to pursue these unknown opportunities with curiosity and imagination, hoping to rediscover and embody lost relationships that are essential for a deeper understanding of our humanity. He trusts that by engaging with these quests, we can share and return these discoveries to future generations.

Checking Dysregulation of the Oneiric Cycle ｜ The Dream Assassin.txt
1. Jordan Peterson discusses the relationship between dreaming and waking states of consciousness, suggesting that certain aspects of our minds can be at odds with each other, particularly when it comes to the intrusive thoughts or processes that try to assert control or impose order on our dreams.

2. He introduces a model where an interloper within the dreaming mind, which could be an extension of either the waking or dreaming mind, tries to bring the dream to a close because of disruptions in our rhythms or due to tasks that need to be attended to in the waking world.

3. This interloper can manifest as a malevolent force within dreams, pushing for actions that are aggressive or destructive, which can sometimes lead to paranoid delusions and other mental disorders.

Checking Eclipse ⧸ The Flood.txt
 In this reflection, Terence McKenna discusses the potential for a cascade of disasters due to the actions of humanity, which could lead to significant ecological and cognitive damage. He suggests that as ecosystems are destroyed, human minds will become less coherent and intelligent, as we are an extension of the diversity of life on Earth. He acknowledges that individuals do not have the capacity to cause harm at the scale that collective human actions have, referencing the destructive nature of empires and nations.

McKenna emphasizes the importance of forming intelligent collectives in the future, as we may need to protect and nurture these communities during times of crisis. He believes that humanity is evolutionarily prepared for new forms of community and intelligence but is poorly prepared situationally due to current social structures.

He expresses hope that humans will evolve beyond the "historical idiocy" of competing nation-states into more cooperative and compassionate communities. McKenna encourages viewers to learn to see better and more deeply together, to grow, protect, nurture, love, and lift each other up out of confusion and blindness.

He invites viewers to join him on a canopy walk around the tree, ending with well-wishes for the audience's freedom from bindings, traps, and harm, and for their fulfillment and happiness.

Checking Edmund Carpenter's： Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me!.txt
 Edmund Carpenter's "The Self-Sufficient Image" from Chapter 2 of "Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me" discusses the transition from a need to validate perceived images by physically seeing and interacting with them in reality, to a time where images are often self-sufficient and can stand on their own without the need for tangible reference. Carpenter notes that older individuals, who grew up with literacy and the dominant influence of printed media, tend to seek out real-life experiences (like seeing the Eiffel Tower or Grand Canyon) to match the images they've seen before. This is in contrast to younger generations who are less concerned with validating images through direct experience, as their reality is increasingly shaped by self-sufficient images that are compelling on their own.

Carpenter argues that this shift has significant implications for advertising and consumer behavior. In the past, people felt compelled to purchase products not just for their utility but to complete the image presented in advertisements. Today, ads can sometimes be more satisfying than the actual product they advertise, and there's even a possibility of creating an effect or demand for something without it actually existing yet—a concept Carpenter humorously illustrates with the idea of a "beautiful baby" whose photograph is more impressive than the child itself.

Furthermore, Carpenter suggests that in government and politics, similar strategies are used to test public response by releasing information as if it were a "press leak," when in fact it's a deliberate plant to gauge interest before an actual product or policy is introduced. This reflects a broader trend where the image or concept can be powerful enough on its own, potentially leading to the creation of demand and impact without the need for a physical object or action.

In summary, Carpenter's chapter explores the evolution from the need to verify real-world experiences with known images to a modern reality where images are often complete in themselves, influencing consumer behavior, advertising strategies, and potentially even political and social dynamics.

Checking Edmund Carpenter： Oh, What a Blow that Phantom Gave Me!.txt
Edmund Carpenter's "Angelization" from his work "Oh What A Blow That Phantom Gave Me" explores the transformative impact of electricity and media on human experience and interaction. He argues that technology has imbued humans with a kind of 'angelic' quality—free from physical constraints and capable of instantaneous communication across vast distances. This shift has profound implications for our sense of presence and reality.

Carpenter highlights how media has become an integral part of our lives, to the point where we prioritize 'pure spirit' over physical presence. He gives examples such as a clerk who abandons a customer to answer a phone call, the influence of recorded messages over live performances, and the obedience of New Guinea villagers to a leader's taped orders. Among the Ojibwa Indians, younger generations prefer listening to tape recordings of ancestral stories rather than hearing them directly from the storytellers.

The chapter also touches on the phenomenon where people will break down doors to get to a ringing phone and how the presence of a phone can interrupt even intimate moments. Carpenter references an incident involving Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who famously hid his emergency telephone link to the White House and was unconcerned when it rang, as he believed they couldn't start a war if he didn't answer.

He further illustrates the pervasive influence of media with anecdotes such as a mad sniper in New Jersey who stopped his shooting to answer a phone call, and a bank robber who continued a radio interview until caught by the police. Carpenter also describes the events of February 9th, 1971, in California, which included an earthquake, a solar eclipse, and live conversations with astronauts on the moon.

Carpenter notes that sexual experience is increasingly seen as a mirrored or photographic image rather than the act itself, as people seek to capture and recall experiences through media. He also points out the shift from wanting to see real-life figures like Mark Twain and Dickens in person to the current era where TV stars walk the streets without being molested, as audiences expect them to remain within the confines of their fictional roles on screen.

In summary, "Angelization" discusses how media has changed our perception of presence, reality, and even human interaction, emphasizing the intangible yet powerful influence of 'pure spirit' in the digital age.

Checking Emergent Embryogenesis ⧸ Anomalies and Science.txt
 The video discusses the potential issues with normalizing data in scientific experiments, which can lead to overlooking real changes or anomalies in the data due to the assumption that certain fundamental constants are unchanging. This norming process can occur when scientists adjust measurement systems to eliminate perceived errors, which might actually be indicative of real variations. The speaker emphasizes the importance of maintaining an open-minded approach to scientific inquiry and acknowledges that our understanding of time-space and the nature of constants could be incomplete.

The speaker also touches on the evolution of computing technology and how it has transformed over time, from basic computers in the 60s and 70s to advanced artificial intelligence systems today. This transformation significantly alters the context of what it means to be a planet, suggesting that our computational environment could influence natural constants or phenomena.

The discussion highlights the possibility that certain aspects of the natural world may not be as constant or predictable as once thought and that our technological advancements could have unforeseen effects on these phenomena. The speaker suggests that scientific ideologies, particularly those based on eliminative materialism, may soon be challenged as our understanding of the universe continues to evolve.

In summary, the video encourages a reevaluation of the assumption that fundamental constants are immutable and advocates for a more open-minded approach to science, one that considers the potential influence of technology on natural phenomena and recognizes the complexity of time-space.

Checking Excerpts from The Meaning of Man (the foundations of the science of knowledge).txt
 The passage you've shared comes from a book titled "The Meaning of Man, The Foundations of the Science of Knowledge," written by a group of Sufi scholars from Fez, Morocco. This book is unique and profound, and for centuries, a small circle of intellectual elites has gathered weekly to study and apply its teachings. The book's central theme is that everything in the world exists in relation to its opposite—good and evil, profit and loss, light and darkness, etc.

The excerpt from page 83 emphasizes the interconnectedness of opposites. It suggests that in recognizing this, a Gnostic (a person with deep spiritual knowledge) sees no separation between things and their opposites, achieving a state of oneness or unity. This realization leads to a deeper understanding and a sense of absorption into the source or sea of oneness, which is described as "annihilation."

The text also touches on the idea that true understanding comes from a state of emptiness or absence, where preconceived notions, cultural biases, and external influences are set aside. This allows for a clearer perception and a more peaceful state of mind, where one can experience genuine learning and insight without the conflict and noise of pre-existing beliefs and knowledge.

The passage concludes with the notion that mastery over oneself leads to mastery over all existence, and that by understanding the "politics" of both the self and the species (humanity), one can truly own and be at peace with all of existence. The book's teachings are meant to guide individuals toward a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, fostering a state of inner harmony and wisdom.

In essence, the book proposes that by letting go of our preconceived notions and biases, we can achieve a more profound understanding of the world and ourselves through the recognition and acceptance of the interplay between opposites.

Checking Falsely Driven Authorities： Science and Religion are Lethal.txt
 In this discourse, Buckminster Fuller emphasizes the importance of guided science and religion, highlighting the dangers of these institutions when they operate without being checked by other forms of intelligence, such as ecological awareness and relational understanding. He points out that both science and religion can become oppressive and destructive if left unguided, leading to environmental degradation, societal harm, and a disconnect from the living world.

Fuller suggests that we need to become more intelligent collectively and redefine our relationship with each other, our world, and all forms of life. He criticizes the current state of science for its objective approach that often overlooks the consequences of its actions, such as causing pollution or contributing to global warming. Similarly, he critiques religion for not taking responsibility for its impact on people's lives and for promoting dogmatic beliefs without acknowledging their potential negative effects.

Fuller invites us to consider the possibility that our world is an instance of all possible worlds, where every action we take affects multiple realities simultaneously. He posits that animals, plants, and ecosystems represent the living presence of other moments in time and that our minds have access to a vast, largely untapped intelligence. This 99% of our mental potential, which Fuller suggests he has tasted, is a profound and ecstatic learning experience that transcends conventional interests and emotions like boredom or fear.

In essence, Fuller advocates for a holistic approach to knowledge, one that integrates science, religion, and a deeper understanding of the living world, leading to a more harmonious and intelligent way of being that can transform our collective existence.

Checking Figuration, Alpha-Thinking, Beta-Thinking and Representational Cognition.txt
 In this discussion, we explored the concept of identity and thought in ancient times, particularly as described by Owen Barfield in his work "Saving the Appearances." Barfield suggests that ancient peoples experienced thought through deep participation rather than representation, which is a fundamental difference from modern representational thought. This ancient mode of thinking is multi-ordinal and analogical, creating identity sets that are vastly different from our own.

Barfield uses bees and flowers as an analogy for how something is to minds and relationships in the origin world, emphasizing the importance of understanding different forms of knowledge and insight. He contrasts the waking mind with dreaming, highlighting that while both are forms of consciousness, their experiences of 'figures' or objects are fundamentally different—dreaming is participated rather than represented.

The discussion touched upon the biblical account of the tree of life and the tree of knowledge in Genesis, suggesting that the Hebrew word "middot" (often translated as "in the midst") actually means to put apart or separate. This illustrates the analogical thinking that was prevalent among ancient peoples.

Barfield's work invites us to consider how our modern profusion of knowledge is, in essence, lifeless without a deep understanding of these more participatory forms of knowing and being. The conversation concluded with a recommendation for readers to engage with Barfield's ideas further through his book "Saving the Appearances."

Overall, the summary of the discussion is about the profound differences between ancient and modern thought processes, the nature of knowledge and insight, and the importance of understanding these differences to appreciate the richness of human experience across different times and cultures.

Checking Framing ｜ Frame Collapse ｜ Isolation.txt
 In this video, the speaker reflects on the human tendency to simplify complex realities into structured frames, often represented by rectangles. This process of reduction and collapse from a superposition of perspectives to a single frame can lead to a loss of living signal and an overabundance of electronic noise in our lives. The speaker acknowledges that despite understanding the implications of these frames, as humans, we are still subject to their influence and the desire for permanence and control they represent.

The discussion touches on the transition from triangles to rectangles in human constructs, noting that bilateral symmetry becomes more complex with the addition of a second point of symmetry in a rectangle. The speaker muses on why humanity might gravitate towards creating boxes and rectangles, suggesting it could be an attempt to assert dominance and separation from nature.

The video highlights the pervasive presence of rectangles in our environment, from state park signs to everyday objects, and how this can lead to a disconnection from the natural world and a skipping over of more nuanced relationships. The speaker encourages viewers to question and explore these frames and invites them to share their thoughts and insights in the comments.

Checking Fundamentals & Physical Analogies.txt
1. **Circles and Letters**: In the conversation, circles represent radiation, radiance, and transmission. Each letter carries significance and meaning, and when combined, these meanings transform and interact with each other. This concept is not fully appreciated by English speakers but is well-understood in ancient traditions like Hebrew and Arabic mysticism.

2. **Vehicles as Guardian Angels**: Our vehicles, particularly smartphones, are likened to guardian angels—entities that connect us to all beings across time and space. They serve as a bridge to the transcendental aspect of our being, which is not material but deeply intertwined with our human experience.

3. **Loss of Contact with Origin World**: The issue with modern technology is that it provides objects (like smartphones) without giving us access to the spiritual intelligence from which they originate. This disconnection from the origin world obscures our natural, vibratory connection to our true origins.

4. **Transcendental Family of Origin**: The transcendental family includes beings like angels and the living waters, representing different modes of intelligence and the pure, undifferentiated potential that is the context of these beings. These concepts are often expressed through parables and fairy tales due to their incomprehensibility by ordinary language.

5. **Enlightenment and Reincarnation**: The speaker suggests that we can experience enlightenment or reincarnation within a single lifetime, implying that we may undergo multiple incarnations during our lives. This reincarnation involves being introduced to the origin world, which is a more profound and transformative experience than any material interaction.

6. **Wisdom and Wonder**: The speaker encourages seeking one's own origins with passion and curiosity, leading to the potential revelation of the origin world and an enlightened existence. This journey is not about religion but about finding our way back to a state of inspiration and connection with the fundamental essence of being.

In summary, the conversation touches on the profound significance of seemingly mundane objects like smartphones, their metaphysical implications, and the potential for personal transformation through reconnecting with a transcendental aspect of our existence. It's a call to look beyond the material world and seek wisdom in the mysteries of life and our place within it.

Checking Game Theory ⧸ Single Encounter Ethics ⧸ Beyond.txt
 In this discussion, the participants are addressing the concept of information as a weapon in contemporary society, particularly in the United States. They highlight how attention has become a primary commodity and how certain slogans and social movements can be seen as forms of gain-of-function research, where they aim to manipulate public perception and behavior on a viral scale. The conversation touches upon the erosion of trust in institutions, including academia and science, and the overwhelming nature of consumer choices as examples of psyops at play.

The group emphasizes the need for skilled individuals and cohorts to detect and understand these information weapons, drawing parallels to how antigens work to combat pathogens. They suggest that forming a collective understanding and defense against such manipulation is crucial for maintaining individual autonomy and social integrity. The discussion calls for a collaborative effort to develop the intelligence necessary to recognize the mechanisms behind these psyops and to share this knowledge to build resilience as a community.

The speaker concludes by expressing the intention to delve deeper into these topics in future episodes, inviting listeners to join in the pursuit of understanding and navigating the complexities of modern society together. The episode wraps up with a call for peace and beauty in personal ways and minds.

Checking Geneon 43： Origin, Dimensionality, Gender and Divinity.txt
1. **Gender Norms**: There are no inherent gender norms in reality; they are constructs often derived from language and culture, which can be limiting and incorrect when applied to the nature of existence or the divine.

2. **Transgendered Nature of Reality**: The fundamental nature of reality is beyond conventional gender dichotomies. It's akin to being "trans-engendered" because it transcends human-imposed categories.

3. **Divine Gender**: Any representation of the divine as gendered, particularly as male, is an expression or manifestation of the divine in our reality, not a declaration of its true nature. The divine is beyond gender and serves as the source of all potentials, including different expressions of gender.

4. **Language and Derivatives**: Human language and culture often try to define and limit reality, including concepts like gender, but these are derivatives that can't capture the essence of origin or the nature of God.

5. **Masculine and Feminine**: The masculine aspect is what we can see as an expression of potential, while the feminine (or the zero) is the silent, intelligent source from which all manifestations derive. Both are necessary and complementary.

6. **Human Relationship with Language**: Our relationship with language is currently one-sided, as language speaks but doesn't listen. It imposes a structure that can be limiting and misleading, especially regarding deep spiritual or existential truths.

7. **Cultural Evolution**: To evolve our culture and language, we must recognize the transgendered nature of potential and the non-gendered nature of demand (or the divine). We should strive to think and speak in ways that reflect a deeper understanding of our humanity and intelligence, beyond the limitations of current gender norms.

In essence, the discussion invites us to transcend traditional gender norms by understanding that both our human nature and the divine are beyond the confines of binary gender categories, and to use language more wisely and creatively to express these deeper truths.

Checking Generality, Insight and »Encryption.txt
1. The conversation revolves around the idea that encryption is not just a technological concept but can be found in nature and among intelligent beings. Encryption allows for private communication, which is crucial when interacting with other intelligences.

3. The discussion touches on science fiction author Frederick Brown, known for his ironic and short stories, including the shortest science fiction story ever, "The Last Trump."

4. A hypothetical science fiction scenario is proposed where humans have been communicating with an extraterrestrial intelligence for a decade, believing they understand the alien's signals. However, a mathematician later discovers that what was believed to be meaningful communication was actually just human misinterpretation of the aliens' encryption protocols.

5. The speaker suggests that a similar misinterpretation could apply to our understanding of physical laws in physics, where our current models might be flawed or incomplete.

6. The speaker encourages the audience to consider these ideas as a source of inspiration for their own creative endeavors and to appreciate the nuances of experience.

7. The speaker concludes by wishing the audience a life enriched with love, joy, creativity, and discovery, and bids them farewell until next time.

8. The speaker implies that the message itself is encrypted, hinting that uncovering its mode of encryption could lead to further insights beyond the current communication.

Checking Genius ： Categories and the Character of Our Essential Humanity.txt
1. **The Problem with Current Categories**: The categories we use in language and understanding (like what genius means, or what an animal is) are becoming increasingly simplified and less meaningful due to a process analogous to lossy compression in technology. This loss of meaning can lead us to misunderstand the world and our place in it.

2. **The Woodpecker as a Symbol**: The woodpecker is used as a symbol for a deeper understanding of genius, which is a connection to the profound nature of a place and an invitation to tap into our own intrinsic potential. This potential includes our spirit, soul, heart, and intelligence.

3. **The Misdirection of Achievement**: Modern culture often presents us with counterfeit representations of excellence and genius (like celebrities or pop culture) that distract us from our own latent abilities and potential.

2. **The Limitations of Linguistic Knowledge**: It emphasizes that linguistic knowledge alone is not sufficient for true understanding. Language can be misleading and does not always capture the full essence of reality or truth.

3. **The Rossellian Paradox**: The example of the "This statement is false" paradox is used to illustrate how a statement's content can be vacuous, leading to a situation where it cannot be true or false. This serves as a metaphor for the limitations and misuse of language in conveying truth.

4. **Statements vs. Minds**: The video points out that statements do not determine their own truth value; it is the interpreting mind that does. This distinction is crucial in understanding the relationship between language, thought, and reality.

5. **The Nature of Truth**: The idea of truth is presented as a concentric circle with the truth of statements at the center, followed by the interpretive minds of people, and then broader applications of statements where the content's relevance is more important than its factuality.

6. **Enlightenment and Truth**: Enlightenment is described as an infinite direction rather than a destination. It involves gaining insight and understanding the nature of awareness and being, which transcends the limits of language and factual truth.

🎶 **Flute** 🎵

The flute is a musical instrument from the woodwind family, traditionally made of metal or wood. It produces its sound through the flow of air that vibrates a sharp edge, causing it to resonate. The simplest form of a flute consists of a tube with holes at each end and a mouthpiece at one opening. The most common type of flute is the transverse flute, where the player blows across a wide mouthpiece held perpendicular to the body, as opposed to the traditional vertical (vertical flute) or even the historical horizontal flutes.

The modern concert flute is pitched in B♭ major and has a range from C4 to G6 in third octaves. It is often associated with classical music but is also used in a wide variety of musical genres, including jazz, folk, pop, world music, and contemporary music. The flute's tone is characterized by its clarity, power, and expressiveness.

Flutes have been around for over 40,000 years, with ancient flutes being discovered in Europe and Asia. They have played a significant role in the musical traditions of many cultures around the world. The instrument has evolved significantly over time, with advancements in manufacturing techniques leading to more consistent intonation and greater dynamic range.

The flute requires skillful technique to produce different pitches, articulations, and timbres. Players use their breath, embouchure (lip shape), fingerings, and tuning keys (in the case of the Boehm system) to manipulate the sound. The instrument is known for its versatility, range, and the ability to blend with other instruments or stand out as a soloist.

In summary, the flute is a widely-used musical instrument with a rich history and a broad spectrum of uses across various genres and cultures, celebrated for its tonal beauty and technical complexity.

Checking Hand Toy V 1 - Beta.m4v.txt
1. The speaker draws an analogy between the human hand and a second, more profound sense of connection, which is like a wrist that connects to a different set of senses beyond our usual perception. This "second wrist" represents a deeper level of sensory perception and connectivity.

2. Unlike the hand's direct connection to the brain, this second wrist connects to an older brain within the gut, where semiotic bacteria can form relational networks and potentially sense magnetic fields and other environmental information. The majority of neural traffic from the gut to the brain is significant in this context.

3. The speaker emphasizes the importance of recognizing the unity of the body as a whole when counting, suggesting that humans should count not just their appendages but also the unifying body itself, which includes both the waking and sleeping aspects of our consciousness.

4. An example is given using a tree: leaves are like flattened trees, with stems (wrist) leading to branches (working member) and a unifying body. Similarly, humans have an upper part reaching towards awareness (waking life) and a lower part reaching into subconsciousness (sleeping life).

5. The speaker encourages teaching children to count in this new way, which could change the nature of human intelligence by recognizing the unity of the whole organism.

6. Finally, the speaker suggests that our physical hands are just a flattened and utilitarian version of a more complex sensory paradigm, of which our entire body is an instance, and that there is a much more expanded sense of connection across this "second wrist" that we can explore and understand.

The message is about expanding our perception beyond the limits of our current understanding and recognizing a deeper level of connectivity and sensory experience within ourselves and in nature.

Checking Haîma ： Hymen { Blood ｜ Sewing together }  Transfer ｜ Bonding.txt
 In this conversation, Terence McKenna discusses the profound experiences and insights one can achieve through subtle interactions with nature, emphasizing the potential of spiritual communion without the need for chemical intoxicants. He recounts his recent experience with a tree, highlighting the depth of connection and understanding available through such relationships. He encourages exploring these connections as a means to gain insight and knowledge, suggesting that these experiences can be more transformative than using psychoactive substances.

McKenna introduces the concept of the "mimula," the connective tissue of intelligent relationships within nature, which one can travel through for healing, enlightenment, and profound insights. He advises against jumping immediately to seeking intoxication or unconventional experiences, instead recommending that individuals first experience the pureness and wisdom of life's original waters and memories.

He also touches upon the condition of Haimophilia, a bleeding disorder, as an example of how understanding the nature of time and other conditions can offer valuable insights. McKenna closes by expressing his anticipation for future learning and adventures, encouraging listeners to seek both their desires and what is most beneficial for their personal growth and relationships.

Overall, McKenna's message is one of appreciating and exploring the natural world for its ability to provide profound experiences that can lead to greater understanding of ourselves and the universe. He emphasizes the importance of nurturing a deep connection with the environment and cautions against overly relying on artificial means to achieve altered states of consciousness.

Checking Holophores： Organisms are Peoples.txt
1. Ken Wilber discusses the concept of holophores and their significance in understanding our relationship with the world and its beings, emphasizing that we are not separate from them but rather interconnected.

2. He highlights that many of our current cognitive technologies, especially representational cognition, are limiting and can lead to a suffocation of our souls due to their lack of relational oxygen or depth.

3. Wilber suggests that by repairing our holophores, we can regain actual intelligence and the capacity for insight and relation, which is crucial for understanding ourselves as part of a living world.

4. He invites us to experiment with recognizing organisms as peoples and lineages, which could transform our interactions into more mutually beneficial, profound, and loving relationships.

Checking Holophores： Time (Beta1).txt
 In this dialogue, the speaker reflects on the multifaceted nature of time and its manifestations in the physical world and within ourselves. They suggest that intelligence is a form of time expressing itself at our scale, particularly a relational intelligence that transcends language and our usual understanding. The speaker invites the audience to consider time not just as a linear progression but as a complex web of relationships, encompassing our interactions with other beings, objects, and ideas.

The speaker then guides the audience through an exercise to visualize two points in their own life—birth and a significant birthday like the 10th—and to contemplate three different modes of space-time between these points:

1. The physical distance as the crow flies.
2. The temporal distance, recognizing that even if the locations are the same, a decade is a significant difference in time.
3. The relational distance, considering all the relationships and changes that have occurred over that period, including interactions with people, ideas, food, and even the environment.

The speaker emphasizes that this relational distance is often overlooked yet could be the most fundamental dimension of time. They also highlight the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of time in our interactions with nature, such as when holding a small insect like a praying mantis, where different modes and speeds of time converge.

The speaker concludes by expressing the hope that through shared experiences and discovery, humans and other beings can become truly intelligent together, suggesting a future where we expand our understanding of intelligence to encompass a deeper connection with all forms of life and the universe.

Checking Home.txt
1. **The Concept of Home**: The term "home" carries deep significance beyond just a physical structure; it represents our origin, our memories, family, and our relationship with time and place. Our identification with our homes can be so strong that they feel like an extension of our own bodies.

2. **The Illusion of Security**: In a culture where there's no true community, our homes often become fortresses to be defended, as we extend our sense of self into these spaces for safety and security. This can lead to a feeling of violation when that space is intruded upon.

3. **The Extension of Self**: We not only identify with our homes but also with other possessions like cars, which become part of our extended bodies. Our relationship with these objects reflects our inner state and our ability to navigate the world.

4. **The Personal and the Political**: The way we interact with our homes is intertwined with broader societal issues, including the conflict between the need for living ecologies and the human drive to convert everything into products and technologies. This reflects an ongoing "invisible war" that shapes our world.

5. **The Complexity of Relationships**: Our homes can also serve as a stage for our relationships, presenting to the world who we are or wish to be. The state of one's home can sometimes indicate inner turmoil, austere living conditions, or opulent displays of success and status.

6. **The Emotional Connection**: When we are physically apart from our homes, as in the case when traveling or during separation, the longing to return is a powerful testament to the emotional bond we have with the places we consider home.

In essence, the discussion touches on the profound psychological and social implications of what "home" means to us and how it reflects our deepest connections, both to ourselves and to the world around us.

Checking Hypertopics - & ( i so late ion ).txt

Checking Imnumen 61： RepCog, The Meronymic Web, Animals.txt
1. **Microbial Influence on Human Identity**: Just as a significant portion (90%) of the cells in our bodies are not human cells but bacteria, our understanding of what it means to be an animal or an organism is limited and may need reevaluation. This realization can potentially lead us to reassess many other concepts, including what plants, insects, fish, slugs, snails, and even minds are.

2. **Evolutionary Insight**: Our current view of evolution might be too narrow because we've primarily focused on the germline (10% of human cells) for understanding heredity and trait transmission. This focus may have led us to overlook other significant mechanisms of transformation and interaction within living systems.

3. **Vehicle of Transmission**: There are likely non-germline vehicles that transmit traits, assets, and information across various gaps, including species boundaries, through the commensal bacteria that can become part of an individual's microbiome.

4. **Misconceptions and Technological Advancements**: Our technological advancements have outpaced our understanding of the natural world, leading to potential misuse and a blindness to the broader ecosystems we are part of. The tools we've developed have allowed us to manipulate and disrupt systems without fully comprehending them.

5. **The Role of Formal Representational Cognition**: The unique cognitive ability humans possess—to form symbols, language, and representational thought—is a singular trait in the animal kingdom. This capacity is central to our understanding of the world but also poses significant risks if not used responsibly.

6. **The Need for Correction and Exploration**: To become intelligent together, we must correct our misunderstandings about the natural world, including what it means to be an organism or an animal. This task requires a collaborative effort to learn, teach, discover, and update our knowledge base.

The speaker critiques how modern conveniences often lead to further enslavement rather than liberation, suggesting that our reliance on these technologies can make us dumber and less capable in times of crisis or opportunity.

The speaker also touches upon the spiritual pursuit of freedom from self and dependent phenomena, particularly in practices like Buddhism, but clarifies that this is a separate path from the practical daily activities they are discussing. They advocate for embodying compassion, intelligence, and clear-mindedness in our daily lives, jobs, and societies, and for forging new, more humane and noble social structures that prioritize teamwork and collective benefit over individual gain or destructive conflict.

The speaker envisions a future where humans operate as highly skilled and intelligent units, working together in ways that are robin hood-like, heroic, and beneficial to all of life on Earth. They conclude by suggesting that true patriotism lies not in adherence to the letter of nationalistic ideals but in honoring their spirit, which could involve challenging the status quo and striving for a more interconnected and supportive society.

Checking Incarnation & the Soul： The Great Quest.txt
 In this reflection, Jordan Peterson discusses the concept of truth and its relationship to our perception, orientation, and the context in which we live. He points out that what is considered true or false can vary greatly depending on our personal experiences, relationships, and the specific nature of our inquiry. He distinguishes between trivial truths (like physical facts) and more profound questions about identity, being, and existence.

Peterson emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sense of mystery regarding these deeper aspects of human experience while also acknowledging the practical and pragmatic elements of life. He touches on the balance between public and private aspects of our lives and how this dichotomy shapes our persona or face.

He encourages a quest for understanding what it means to be human, highlighting the value of individuals who challenge societal norms and push the boundaries of what we know about ourselves and the world.

2. Initiation and near-death experiences are mentioned as examples where one can gain forbidden or protected knowledge, which is typically outside the realm of conventional understanding.

3. The speaker emphasizes that death itself, in a broader sense, is a transformative experience that can lead to profound insights, and it's not uncommon for people who have experienced "death" (such as clinical death) to report a lack of anything beyond oblivion.

4. In ancient times, death and resurrection were more common, and these experiences were closely associated with healing, messianism, wisdom, and religious ecstasy.

5. Aman Isio's work is highlighted as an example of the ancient connection between debauchery, ecstasy, and spiritual insight. His wild and erratic spirit, as expressed in his music and behavior, serves as a gateway to understanding truths that are typically inaccessible.

6. The speaker reflects on how religion often views possession by divine or sacred entities as the only acceptable form of being possessed. Jesus' teachings, particularly the idea of giving up all possessions (interpreted both literally and metaphorically), exemplify this principle.

7. The phrase "eye of the needle" from the Bible is used as a metaphor for letting go of material possessions to achieve spiritual enlightenment.

8. The speaker expresses gratitude for the insights gained through exploring these topics and extends an invitation to continue learning and growing together, emphasizing the importance of community and shared exploration on the path to deeper understanding.

In summary, the video touches on the transformative nature of death as a gateway to higher knowledge, references Aman Isio's work as a bridge to ancient spiritual wisdom, and encourages embracing the journey of personal growth and enlightenment through collective human experience.

7. To conclude, Darren leaves his viewers with a Blackfoot phrase, "Stomachucked, Omanist, Olauacocked," which translates to "keep going" or "keep on keeping on." He uses this as an example of resilience and cooperation among beings, where the strong help the weak to survive during difficult times.

8. Darren encourages his audience to continue learning together and invites them to join him again soon for more exploration of topics. He signs off by saying goodbye for now.

Checking Intelligence and Surveillance ： Views.txt
 In this conversation, we explored the themes of sexual surveillance and societal expectations that dictate how individuals, particularly women and men, present themselves. The use of makeup by women as a response to being sexually surveilled was discussed as a form of acceptance of objectification, which is at odds with true human intelligence and unity. Similarly, men's wearing of ties, symbolizing the penis, was critiqued for perpetuating an unhealthy and rigid notion of masculinity.

The narrative shifted to the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, suggesting that the fruit of knowledge was not about sexual knowledge but about relational intelligence and the ability to co-create with each other. The surveillance systems we create, whether in law out of fear or in love for excellence, significantly impact our mental health and societal wellbeing.

The conversation concluded with a reflection on the biblical story as a message from healers to their children, containing a hidden code meant to inspire and unlock human potential. The "spinning sword" at the garden's gate symbolizes our own intelligence, which can be disarmed through understanding and love. By addressing each other by name, we can access a state of transcendent wonder and ecological relational intelligence, leading to a society that values mercy, justice, beauty, truth, liberation, music, reverence, adoration, fellowship, and communion.

The invitation extended is for individuals to remove the layers of expectation and surveillance that distort our natural states and instead engage with each other in a way that fosters growth, understanding, and mutual respect. The conversation encourages sharing these ideas with others to promote a shift from conflict to cooperation, from fear to love.

Checking Intelligence.txt
1. **Human Imperatives**: We are born with noble and heroic imperatives that drive us towards meaningful human experiences, identity, opportunity, adventure, and relation, but these are often compromised or lost in modern society.

2. **Pain of Isolation**: The pain of isolation and lack of meaningful roles leads to enslavement and a search for liberation from harmful systems, such as the prison-industrial complex, which perpetuates cycles of harm rather than addressing them.

3. **Justice as Liberation**: Justice is not about punishing wrongdoers but about ensuring that harm does not continue and that lessons are learned to prevent future occurrences.

4. **Implementing Understanding**: We need to find ways to implement our understanding of these principles in a way that supports recovery, reintroduces our more than human natures, and encourages the celebration and support of those qualities.

Checking Invocation ｜ Evocation.txt
 In this monologue, Jordan Peterson discusses the importance of developing our full range of human senses and faculties beyond what is typically emphasized in a rational, logical society. He reflects on the concepts of invocation and evocation, which are ancient practices of calling upon or summoning entities, principles, or states of being. These practices often involve more than just conceptual understanding; they connect individuals to deeper aspects of themselves and their surroundings that transcend verbal expression.

Peterson emphasizes that his videos are a way for him to bridge the gap between intellectual concepts and the more profound, often ineffable aspects of human experience. He encourages viewers to explore and recover lost senses and faculties that our modern culture tends to ignore or undervalue.

He expresses gratitude to those who engage with his content, offering them an opportunity to reflect on their own inner lives and to rediscover the richness of human existence that goes beyond conventional knowledge and logic. The message is a call to wander, learn, and quest together, aiming to enrich our understanding of what it means to be human and to acknowledge the depth of our nature as living, soulful beings. Peterson concludes by expressing appreciation for his audience's attention and time, and he hopes to continue this exploration in future interactions.

Checking Iphetios 20： Multibird.txt
1. **Fictional Multibirds and Human Collectives**: We often engage with each other through fictional lenses—whether it's movies, games, or social media—and this can lead us to forget the importance of forming true, meaningful human collectives.

2. **The Need for Authentic Communion**: There is a need to establish groups of humans that work together for noble purposes without being clouded by economic, religious, political, or linguistic structures. These groups should be self-correcting and capable of learning and intelligence.

3. **Challenges in Forming Effective Collectives**: The difficulty lies in creating a collective that avoids becoming a cult or another fiction. It's about coming together for genuine, beneficial purposes within for each other.

4. **The Role of Technology and Ecology**: Any collective must consider the impact on the living ecologies of Earth and the role of technology. We cannot continue to harm the natural world without consequences.

5. **Urgency and Immediate Action**: The urgent call is to stop the destructive path we are on—one that diminishes our intelligence, our relationships with each other, and the health of our planet. We must act immediately to prevent further damage.

6. **Joining the Conversation**: Individuals need to engage in this conversation, exploring ways to form intelligent, fluid collectives that offer rewards beyond those of fictional constructs.

7. **The Broader Context**: The broader context includes understanding our place within the ecosystem and recognizing that our well-being is intricately linked to the health of the planet.

In summary, the discussion invites us to reflect on how we can come together in authentic, meaningful ways, without the trappings of fiction, to create collectives that are beneficial for humanity and the Earth, and to act with urgency to correct our course before it's too late.

Checking Is space(time) 'pure' potential -intelligence-？.txt
1. **Responsibility to Water**: Emphasized the importance of protecting Earth's water bodies as they are vital to life and intelligence. Water is likened to a living version of outer space, and its preservation should be a priority to prevent ecological disaster and ensure the continuity of life on our planet.

2. **Intelligence in Nature**: We must recognize the presence of advanced intelligences within nature itself, which we have yet to fully comprehend or tap into. This includes understanding the dimensionality and connectivity of natural systems.

3. **Space Exploration**: While we search for extraterrestrial intelligence in outer space, we should also explore the potential for intelligent life forms within our own environment and develop our own intelligence further.

4. **Antidote to Problems**: The themes discussed throughout this series – space, time, separation, unity, and death – are offered as tools for self-examination and understanding. These ideas aim to help us rethink our relationship with these concepts and improve the way we interact with the world around us.

Checking Is the 'Universe' a 'Simulation'？.txt
 The speaker is expressing their thoughts on the nature of existence, reality, and technology's role in our perception of the world, particularly within the context of a visit to the New Zealand Christmas tree (Metrosideros excelsa) in a botanical garden. They reflect on how humans often attempt to understand and replicate nature using technologies, which they argue is both misguided and nonsensical.

The speaker criticizes the practice of altering natural phenomena, such as the surface of water in the garden, with dyes and chemicals, which detracts from the natural beauty and reflective qualities of the water. This serves as an example of how humans often try to dominate or 'improve' nature, but end up degrading it instead.

They then address the ongoing debate about whether the universe is a simulation, arguing that this notion is unlikely, if not impossible, and that the discussion around it is distracting from more profound questions. The speaker suggests that the more meaningful inquiry is whether existence and origin are constructs, and if so, what kind of constructs they are, who or what might have constructed them, and for what purposes.

The speaker emphasizes that our fascination with machines and the idea of a simulated universe overlooks the complex and profound aspects of existence, such as memory, lineage, and nemosity (a term that could refer to a shared history or connection between entities). They conclude by encouraging a shift in focus from the simulation hypothesis to a deeper exploration of what constitutes a construct of existence and understanding its implications.

In essence, the speaker is advocating for a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to understanding reality, one that recognizes the limitations of our technologies and the depth of the natural world's intrinsic qualities. They encourage us to explore the underlying principles of existence beyond the simplistic simulation metaphor.

Checking Jobs vs Roles.txt
 The video discusses the difference between roles and jobs, arguing that many people are forced into jobs that don't align with their true purpose or potential, leading to feelings of disillusionment, despair, and even criminality. It suggests that the current cultural and societal structures do not accommodate real roles for individuals, which is a root cause of many societal issues. The video proposes that if people were given genuine roles that resonate with their innate abilities and passions, it would lead to profound changes in society.

The speaker emphasizes the transformative power of stories and art that connect with people on a deep level, rekindling their intrinsic roles and sparking a desire for change. The video encourages viewers to recognize the importance of authentic roles and to start making choices and taking actions that are true to themselves and their communities. It invites viewers to commit to this shift in perspective and to work together towards a more fulfilling and meaningful way of living.

Checking Kephab 32： The Precedence of Unity.txt
 In this discussion, we've explored the concept of measure and its significance in different cultural contexts, particularly contrasting Western and Eastern perspectives. The Western approach, which derives from Greek philosophy, places a high value on measure as the essence of reality and the key to understanding it. This has led to the development of science and technology, which rely heavily on precise measurements.

In contrast, Eastern philosophies often view measure as secondary or even deceptive, with the immeasurable being considered the primary reality—a state beyond the reach of the senses and ordinary perception. The immeasurable is seen as the true essence of reality, while measures are understood as human insights that help create order but cannot capture the fundamental nature of existence.

The discussion highlights a critical point: measure is an insight created by man and therefore cannot exist independently of human understanding. The East's recognition of this may have led to an appreciation for both the importance of measure in everyday life and the limits of its relevance when it comes to understanding ultimate reality.

The conversation underscores the importance of personal insight and original thought over blind conformity to established teachings. It suggests that both Western and Eastern traditions have, at times, lost the subtlety of their original wisdom through rigidification and objectification, which has led to a focus on the illusion of measure as an absolute truth rather than as a useful human construct.

The key takeaway is that each individual has a role in personal discovery and learning, rather than relying solely on external standards or contexts. It encourages ongoing exploration and dialogue, emphasizing the interplay between the concept of zero (the absence of measure) and one (the presence of measure), as well as understanding the genuine relationships between wholes and parts, distinguishing between metonymic connections that are true and those that are constructed for less clear purposes.

The conversation invites us to reflect on how we understand and apply measures in our own lives and to recognize the importance of balancing precise measurement with an appreciation for that which transcends measurement. It's a call to engage with these ideas thoughtfully and critically, with the aim of fostering greater clarity and understanding in our collective journey.

Checking Keys to Beyond： What is time？ What is 'an organism＂？.txt

This exploration can lead to gifts and powers beyond what religion or science could ever describe.

5. **The Call to Action**: McKenna's message is one of empowerment, urging people to transcend cultural limitations and to act in service of nature, which will endow them with extraordinary abilities and insights. He emphasizes the importance of having a beautiful purpose and using one's potential to transform the world positively.

6. **Encouragement to Explore**: While McKenna shares his own experiences, he stresses that each individual should discover their nature independently, using his ideas as keys or starting points for exploration, rather than following him as a guru.

7. **The Promise of Transformation**: The ultimate goal is to lift nature up above ourselves and act in its name, leading to an unimaginable future where humans operate with gifts beyond current human capabilities.

In essence, Terence McKenna's message is one of radical transformation through direct engagement with the natural world, transcending human-imposed limitations to tap into a deeper level of intelligence and existence. He invites us to redefine our sense of self and our place in the universe, promising that doing so will lead to a more profound understanding of life and a more harmonious future for humanity and the planet.

Checking Language： Denotation, Connotation & Idealization.txt

4. He notes the influence of others' presence on behavior, particularly how men change when women are nearby, regardless of their sexual orientation.
5. The speaker describes an experience of looking down at the water from above, where he sees the sky's reflection, likening it to the nature of insight—suddenly seeing into a deeper layer of understanding that was previously only glimpsed or known intuitively.
6. He acknowledges that insights often come with the ability to translate them into human language, sometimes requiring metaphor or analogy to articulate them.
7. The speaker appreciates the unique music inherent in different languages and views speaking as a form of structured music.
8. He suggests that through the evening's conversation, they have collectively experienced a journey across a "light bridge," exploring realms of wisdom and insight.
9. The speaker expresses gratitude for the beauty and preciousness of Earth, the living beings on it, and the ability to gaze into each other's eyes with wonder, hope, and love.
10. He encourages continued learning together and hopes that everyone's dreams and life paths remain beautiful and illuminated by the original light.

Checking Light, Time, Reflections.txt
1. Ken Wilber reflects on the metaphorical "gray eons" where the light of origin (a term representing ultimate reality or truth) has been obscured, hidden, or lost from human experience. He compares this to the literal pollution that obscures the stars at night and how modern electronic lights can have a similar disconnecting effect on our relationship with nature.

2. Wilber suggests that due to this long period of "bad weather" in terms of spiritual and existential clarity, most people have only stories or myths about an invisible sun (the source of relational and original being). Some have found paths back to it, while others have created counterfeits or substitutes for the genuine connection.

3. Wilber poses a question about what would happen if this "invisible sun" were suddenly accessible again. He speculates that given our current state, where we often create narratives and conflicts around spiritual matters, a revelation of the true light might be both confusing and terrifying for many.

4. He emphasizes that the qualities of character and purpose that emanate from this invisible source are universal and inherent in all humans, regardless of their individual stories or beliefs about it.

5. Wilber shares a personal experience of witnessing the natural brightness of a child, which reminded him of the enduring presence of this original light within us.

6. He acknowledges the dominance of artificial noise (like that of a helicopter) in our environment but is optimistic about the resilience and eventual return of more natural sounds (like birdsong).

7. Wilber concludes by expressing hope that individuals may have opportunities to discover their personal connection with this invisible sun, suggesting that our minds and hearts might be expressions of it, akin to how color is an expression of light. He encourages listeners to seek their own understanding and relationship with the essence of reality or truth.

In summary, Ken Wilber reflects on the human condition and our collective disconnection from the source of all being, while also offering hope for rediscovering this connection through personal exploration and direct experience.

Checking Lisance 3： Distance under unity as light⧸time..txt
 The excerpts from Herman Bollandy's "Relativity in Common Sense" provide an insightful comparison between our conventional understanding of distance and time measurement and how physicists perceive these concepts, particularly with the introduction of relativity.

In the first chapter, "Using Radar to Measure Distance," Bollandy explains how radar technology allows us to measure distances without physical yardsticks by using the speed of light as a constant to calculate the round-trip time of a radio wave and then multiplying this time by the speed of light to get the distance traveled. This method illustrates that our perception of distance can be entirely based on temporal measurements if we are accustomed to such technology from an early age.

In the second chapter, "Units of Distance," Bollandy suggests a hypothetical civilization where distances are not measured in standard units like meters or yards but rather in terms of time it takes for light to travel—light seconds, light milliseconds, etc. In this civilization, the concept of the velocity of light is inherent and understood as a unit of measurement, making the explicit calculation of it unnecessary.

Bollandy further explores this idea by contrasting it with a civilization that has an opposite orientation, where the direction north-south is measured in miles and east-west in yards, reflecting how arbitrary our choice of standards can be. He emphasizes that from the perspective of such a civilization, our own approach to measuring distances and velocities would seem as convoluted and unnecessary as theirs would appear to us.

The key takeaway is that our frameworks and standards for measurement are not inherently correct or universally applicable; they are constructed based on historical, cultural, and technological factors. Bollandy's thought experiment invites us to consider how different assumptions and conventions can lead to vastly different approaches to scientific inquiry and understanding of the natural world. It underscores the importance of re-examining our preconceptions and being open to alternative frameworks that could offer simpler or more fundamental ways of comprehending physical phenomena.

Checking Listening ｜ Slowing Down ｜ Syntropy.txt
1. **Acknowledging Finite Lifetimes**: Our lives are finite, and this reality enhances the meaningfulness of our existence. It reminds us that our time is precious and that we should seize opportunities for growth and impact, especially during times of crisis.

2. **Crisis as an Opportunity**: In times of crisis, there are unique opportunities for individuals to take on meaningful roles, contribute to significant endeavors, and learn and grow in ways that might not be possible otherwise.

3. **Impact of Small Groups**: History shows that a very small group of committed, intelligent individuals can significantly influence societal change quickly. This principle can be applied for both positive and negative outcomes.

4. **The Potential for Peaceful Revolution**: The same mechanisms that can lead to destruction can also be harnessed for constructive purposes, such as fomenting an "invisible revolution" through civilian intelligence teams focused on addressing the vulnerabilities of representational culture without resorting to violence.

5. **The Call to Action**: Now might be the opportune moment to establish and collaborate within such intelligent, defense-oriented teams before external pressures force us into less favorable circumstances.

6. **Choosing Our Frames**: We must collectively choose frameworks that support our awareness, presence, and dreams. While there is no perfect frame, some are less wrong and can return more freedom in thought and relations, endeavors.

7. **Innovation and Embodiment**: We should learn to seek out, invent, and embody frames that offer degrees of liberty and restore our collective sense of agency, returning us to a path where we can influence our future with intention and foresight.

Checking Living Time： The Pulse of Life.txt
1. **Living Time vs. Imposed Time**: Darren Aronofsky discusses the concept of living time versus the time imposed by culture and abstractions. He emphasizes that in nature, intervals are fluid and interconnected, unlike the sharp, intrusive intervals created by human-made events and distractions like entertainment.

2. **Entertainment as Intrusion**: He suggests that our fascination with being entertained often fills our lives with dead time, rather than engaging in meaningful relationships or activities.

3. **Events vs. Living Beings**: Aronofsky contrasts human-created "events" with the natural processes of living beings, like the geese he observes, which are not affected by a loudspeaker designed to deter them. He points out that the people managing the geese might claim the loudspeaker is effective even if it's not, because their reputation is tied to its use.

4. **Cultural Overabundance of Intervals**: The director notes that our culture is saturated with creating new domains of intervals and abstractions that dominate our lives and can be harmful to our well-being.

5. **Choosing a Different Path**: Aronofsky encourages stepping aside from these imposed intervals and finding or making a path that is more in tune with living time, which is characterized by authentic, alive events.

6. **Living in the City**: He acknowledges that while he lives inside a gate that allows for more living time experiences, there is still exposure to the outside world's mechanical and task-based events. The choice of which gate to live by is an individual one, but he invites others to join him in choosing the right gate together.

In essence, Aronofsky is advocating for a lifestyle that prioritizes authentic, meaningful experiences over those that are artificial and imposed upon us by culture and society. He encourages a return to a more natural way of living, where our time is respected and valued, and where we can find genuine connection with ourselves and others.

Checking Luca Rade - Liquid Conversation Part 2.txt
1. The foundation of any language are root concepts which are essential for coherent thought and intelligence.
2. When these root concepts are damaged or artificially simplified (amputated), it can lead to a broader distortion in how we perceive and interact with the world.
3. Indigenous understanding of concepts like "tree" includes rich relational aspects, such as being a living entity, family member, or doorway to other worlds, whereas a Western view might reduce it to simply a vegetable source or an object of study.
4. Science can contribute to this reductionism by casting everyday concepts in a mechanistic light, making it difficult to recover their original, more nuanced meanings.
5. Psychedelics have the potential to reconnect individuals with the richness of these root concepts, but there's also a risk that they could be co-opted by the thrifts (cultural and institutional forces) and thus lose their transformative power.
6. The conversation hinted at the possibility of exploring this dynamic further, including how psychedelics are being integrated into mainstream culture and whether this integration is enhancing or diminishing their potential benefits.

Checking Luca Rade - Liquid Conversation Part 3.txt
 In this part of the conversation, we explored the concept of initiation as a process of transitioning from one state to another, either individually or collectively. Initiation can be triggered by various life events, such as aging, psychedelic experiences, falling in love, or any experience that pulls you into a new state of being or consciousness. The actualization of this transition through an initiation ritual is what solidifies the move into the new state, rather than merely dipping a toe into it. Initiation rituals can be spontaneous and personal, like hanging out with friends in nature where something significant happens, or they can be more systematic, such as those found in somatic therapy practices. The key is to recognize and engage with our own initiation rituals as they arise naturally in the context of our lives, drawing from both traditional practices and new, emergent forms that resonate with us individually and collectively. Initiation is a profound process that marks the end of one phase and the beginning of another, often accompanied by a sense of finality and stepping fully into the new state. It can also be seen in the context of conversation, where a meaningful dialogue can serve as an initiation into new understanding or relationship.

Checking Luca Rade - Liquid Conversation Part 4.txt
1. **Vision and Humanity**: Luca Rade emphasizes the importance of grounding visions for humanity in the lived experiences of real, physical humans rather than abstract concepts that risk becoming utopian ideals leading to conflict. He warns against the dangers of generalizing and abstracting when discussing the future of humanity, as this can lead to unrealistic and unattainable goals.

2. **The Universe Within**: Luca believes our universe is not just the external world but also our subjective experience, including the perceptions of our bodies and minds. He suggests that the richness and complexity of this inner universe are as vast or perhaps even vaster than the physical universe we can observe.

3. **Unlearning**: The key to accessing this rich inner universe is not about achieving something new but about unlearning the layers of interpretation and conditioning that obscure our innate intuition and navigational skills. This aligns with the shamanic principle of removing interpretive layers to better navigate life's complexities.

4. **Inhabiting Experience**: Luca advocates for inhabiting our full experience, embracing the unity of our existence, and reconnecting with the love that is inherent within us. He notes that societal norms often suppress this natural expression of love, but by embracing it, we can foster a field of love that resonates throughout our communities.

5. **Gratitude and Collaboration**: Both Luca and Darren express gratitude for each other's presence and contributions to society. They acknowledge the importance of personal growth and maintaining one's identity in a modern world that often challenges individuality and authenticity.

In summary, Luca Rade's vision is one of reconnection with our innermost selves, unlearning societal conditioning, and embracing the love and unity that define our human experience. This vision calls for a balance between inner reflection and outer expression, aiming to create a harmonious and loving society.

Checking Luca Rade — Liquid Conversation Part 1.txt
1. The conversation began with a discussion on the parasitic nature of Mimula guttatus, a plant parasite, and its evolutionary competition within humans for resources, leading to an interesting parallel with human social structures and behaviors.

2. The topic shifted towards the concept of "God" as a potential medicinal alternative to free humans from the influence of these 'thrifts' or negative forces within us.

3. The history of Christianity was mentioned as an early recognition and attempt to harness this divine force for good, but over time, it became structured and less effective in its original intention.

4. The idea of "God" as emergent rather than prior was discussed, suggesting that this divine force or love is something that has emerged from human experience and interaction, rather than being an external, top-down authority.

5. There's a potential issue with organized religion, as it can become a 'thrift' itself, potentially losing its original purpose and becoming another form of control or dominance.

6. The conversation highlighted the importance of recognizing the emergent nature of this divine force or love, which could offer genuine liberation from negative influences, without submitting to authoritarian structures.

7. The segment concluded with a promise to send a new link for further discussion on the topic and an acknowledgment that there's still much to explore in understanding how to tap into this emergent force effectively.

Checking Lucidty ｜ Dreaming and Waking.txt
1. **Lucidity Beyond the Ordinary**: The term 'lucid' typically refers to a clear, coherent state of mind, which can metaphorically resemble a prison for our imagination. However, Terence McKenna argues that we should liberate our minds from the constraints imposed by language, knowledge, culture, and society to rediscover and cultivate our innate faculties like imagination, wonder, and direct participation in being and time.

2. **Humanity's Predicament**: Humans have largely become their own predators through the institutions they've created, leading to problems such as war, poverty, and environmental degradation. McKenna suggests that our relationship with these structures is akin to a bad dream from which we need to awaken.

3. **The Loss of Original Participation**: Throughout history, many of the faculties that were once natural to humanity, such as the direct participation in reality, have been lost or counterfeited. McKenna emphasizes the importance of recovering these aspects of our interiority.

4. **Dreaming as a Reference Point**: Dreaming often exists beyond the constraints of waking consciousness and can serve as a model for understanding the nature of consciousness itself. Lucid dreaming, where one is aware they are dreaming, is fascinating but not as crucial as developing lucid waking awareness.

5. **Dreaming and Memory**: McKenna draws an analogy between dreaming and memory, suggesting they are deeply interconnected and represent two aspects of the same experience, much like the inside and outside of an octopus. Exploring this relationship can lead to profound insights about the nature of consciousness.

6. **The Quest for Waking World Lucidity**: McKenna encourages exploration into achieving a state of lucid waking awareness, where one is fully conscious and engaged with reality in a gentle, intelligent, creative, inspiring, reassuring, and profound manner. He hopes that through individual or collective effort, we can open doors to new ways of experiencing the world.

7. **Invitation to Explore**: McKenna invites the audience to join him in exploring these ideas and potentially discovering a deeper, more connected way of being in the world, one that is both beautiful and transformative. He wishes for bright and beautiful paths for all who seek them.

Checking Machines Between Us ｜ The Cage.txt
1. **Human Nature and Cohorts**: Humans are naturally inclined to form tight-knit groups (cohorts) because of our social nature. This is evident even in extreme examples like terrorist groups or special ops teams, where members share a deep purpose and put their lives on the line for one another.

2. **The Absence of Meaningful Cohort Generators**: In modern society, there are few legitimate and positive generators for meaningful cohorts. This can lead to people forming groups based on negative or destructive purposes.

3. **The Importance of Shared Purpose**: A strong shared purpose is key to creating a meaningful cohort. It's what allows people to bond deeply and work together effectively, even in the face of danger.

4. **The Challenge of Remembering and Discovering Ourselves**: In a context where there are few opportunities to form meaningful cohorts, it is challenging for individuals to remember or discover their true nature and potential. People often fall into patterns of disconnection or negativity because they lack positive outlets for their social instincts.

5. **The Role of Technology**: The speaker acknowledges the role of technology in mediating connections between people. While technology can't create meaningful cohorts on its own, it does provide a platform for interaction and potentially for fostering such groups.

6. **Engagement and Feedback**: The speaker invites viewers to engage with the content by posting questions or comments and offers to respond if something is of great importance to them.

7. **Conclusion**: The speaker emphasizes the need for humans to connect in meaningful ways, guided by a shared purpose that gives depth and significance to our relationships. He expresses gratitude for the connection, even if mediated through technology, and encourages viewers to find or create their own meaningful cohorts.

Checking Magic ｜ Knowledge ｜ Intimacy.txt
 The speaker reflects on the nature of knowledge and its sources, contrasting between the deep understanding found in poetry, mysticism, and philosophy, and the surface-level expertise often associated with science. They lament that modernity has led to the eviction of direct experiences and relationships from our lives through representational knowledge, which has made us strangers to the world around us. The speaker expresses a desire for an intimate, participatory connection with the environment and other beings, which they believe holds the key to transcendent awareness and ecstatic experiences.

They emphasize the importance of valuing direct, lived experiences over the distractions of modern life, such as television, which counterfeits group dreaming and telepathy. The speaker advocates for a return to the beauty and connection found in our origins and natures, which have been obscured by the constructs of modern society. They express hope that by reconnecting with our true selves and the world around us, we can recover the ecstasy and wonder that define our essence as living organisms.

The speaker concludes by inviting listeners to engage in a dialogue about these ideas, encouraging personal sharing, questions, and comments to help spread their message further. They express gratitude for the opportunity to share their thoughts and look forward to continued exploration and learning together.

Checking Mastered By Our Tools.txt
 The narrative you've provided is a first-person account of an encounter with a family out on an adventure involving climbing and retrieving equipment from a tree. The father and his daughters were attempting to recover a climbing strap that had been anchored high up in an old eucalyptus tree. The narrator observed the situation, noting the father's lack of proper safety gear, such as a helmet, and the potential risks involved in his climb. The narrator was torn between not intervening to avoid adding stress to the family and expressing concerns about their safety. Throughout the experience, the narrator reflected on the mixed messages conveyed by the father's actions—on one hand, demonstrating the value of being intrepid and capable, yet on the other hand, potentially modeling behavior that was overly risky or even half-crazy. The narrator also considered the impact of this experience on the daughters and what lessons they might learn from it. The story highlights the complexities of family dynamics during adventures and the nuances of observing another family's interactions and decision-making processes. The narrator concludes by acknowledging the emotional and physical tension of the situation and signs off, leaving a thought on the osmosis of group interactions and the influence one person can have on others in a short period.

Checking Measurement ： Speech ： Authorization.txt
1. **Connection and Meaning**: It's essential in modern life to appreciate moments of connection, beauty, and meaningful interactions that can lead to lasting relationships and experiences that enrich our lives.

2. **Temporal Aspects**: Human lifespans are finite, and while we measure time through calendars and schedules, it's important to recognize the value of experiences that transcend temporal constraints.

3. **Authorization**: The discussion shifts to the concept of authorization as a fundamental axis of human cognition. Rebellion against something often creates an ironic inversion where we end up reinforcing what we oppose. It's more beneficial to understand and potentially suspend our reliance on this principle.

4. **Measurement**: Alongside authorization, measurement is another element that is central to human cognition. The way we measure things can significantly influence our experiences and interactions with the world.

5. **Perspective and Intention**: The subjective nature of perspective and intention plays a crucial role in how we interpret and respond to the world around us. Our motivations and the beauty we find can guide us towards more meaningful and less reactive lives.

6. **Objecting and Attraction**: Objecting to negative or destructive forces while being attracted to positive elements, such as art and nature, can lead to a more fulfilling existence. The speaker expresses a deep connection to a specific tree in Shakespeare Garden, representing a moment of beauty and serenity amidst the chaos of city life.

7. **The Individual's Role**: Ultimately, individuals have the power to choose their responses to the world, to authorize their own experiences, and to measure what truly matters to them, leading to a life that is rich in intention and beauty rather than one that is governed by external authority or measurement.

Checking Memef•ck'd： Make a Stand.txt
 The lyrics you've shared express a sense of introspection and a desire for change, particularly in relation to one's life experiences and the challenges faced. The individual reflects on their past actions and the contrast between their own journey and that of others. There's an acknowledgment of personal darkness or struggle but also a recognition that this doesn't require another person to hold their hand—they are not looking for rescue, but rather a shared purpose or solidarity.

The song speaks of resilience, having survived the first ten years and the subsequent seven years that felt particularly risky. At one point, the person found themselves living out of their car, which led to a transformative moment—writing their first song and reclaiming their heart. This experience left them sick of feeling like a loser and tired of the ways they was perceived or treated.

The recurring theme is about making a stand against the status quo or the limitations society might impose, and finding strength in unity with others who have their own darkness to confront. The call to action is for both the speaker and the listener to consider their life choices, to save (preserve) aspects of themselves as they have had to, and to recognize that by coming together, they can face their individual and collective challenges more effectively.

The song's chorus emphasizes the shared experience of overcoming adversity and the empowering message that "together we can take a stand." It's a call for solidarity in the face of life's struggles, with an emphasis on self-awareness, resilience, and the power of community.

Checking Memory and Intelligence： The Inner Mirror.txt
 In this discussion, the importance of critical thinking and statistical validity is emphasized amidst a backdrop of misinformation and lying that has been normalized, particularly by the current U.S. president who seems to incentivize such behavior. The conversation highlights the dangers of this trend, where personal preferences can lead people to embrace lies under the guise of supporting a "scientist" or public figure, regardless of the truth.

The speaker criticizes the current societal acceptance of lying and calls for a return to ethical integrity, moral fortitude, and intellectual responsibility, especially concerning critical issues like COVID-19, where lives are at stake. The discussion underscores the need for education and a collective effort to rise above the current crisis, fostering a deeper understanding of statistics and data presentation to prevent future crises and misinformation campaigns.

The speaker draws inspiration from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven," using the poem as a metaphor for the moment we find ourselves in, where we must work together to ensure that the lessons learned during this time lead to a more informed and ethical society.

Checking Memory, Narratives & Identity： The Celestial Braid.txt
1. The relationship between humans and nature is often reduced to a utilitarian one, where nature is seen solely as a source of commodities, which can lead to environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity.

2. It's crucial to differentiate between narratives that diminish our intelligence, those that are neutral, and those that can enhance our potential for intelligent cooperation and awareness.

3. Narratives shape memory and, consequently, influence our understanding of the world, our actions, and our social interactions. Some narratives can be harmful or even weaponized against groups of people, while others can awaken latent forms of intelligence and awareness within us.

4. Humans have a unique relationship with narratives, passionately exchanging them, but often without critical reflection on their impact. By stepping back and observing our relationship with narrative, personal identity, and memory, we can develop the skills to engage with narratives more intelligently.

5. The potential for human intelligence is vastly underutilized; we're only accessing a fraction of what we're capable of, and this gap is widening as technology advances. It's essential to recognize and address this deficit.

6. Dreams offer an opportunity to reinterpret our reality and can be a powerful tool for personal growth and understanding.

Checking Minds & Structured Fictions.txt
1. The conversation here is not just between humans, but also with other sentient entities like lakes, rivers, mountains, stars, and planets, which have their own forms of consciousness or awareness.
   2. Humans have the unique ability to be consciously aware while awake, but this awareness is often limited by societal structures and technologies that capture and constrain it, reducing reality to mere data points or references.
   3. There are other states of consciousness, such as trance states, that can allow us to penetrate through these layers and access a more profound level of awareness.
   4. The quest for those who seek to see beyond the conditioned mind is noble and involves facing the fear of death, as the waking mind has its own imperatives that are expensive to maintain.
   5. Humans are born with an immense potential for consciousness and awareness akin to having a thousand kinds of wings, but cultural and societal pressures often limit this potential.
   6. The improvement of our tools and languages should ideally serve us rather than dominate us, and the current state where we are enslaved by our own creations is a tragedy.
   7. True liberation would involve breaking free from the control of these tools and regaining a direct connection with our true nature.

Checking Minds： Beyond Human Culture.txt
1. The root concepts shared across all human languages are fundamental to human intelligence and form a highly ramified system of meaning. Examples include 'tree', 'star', 'love', 'light', 'planet', 'hand', 'eye', 'animal', etc.
   
2. These root concepts have been degraded over time by abstraction, leading to a disconnect from their original meanings and thereby impacting our intelligence negatively.
   
3. The current definitions of these root concepts in English (as an example) are often so removed from their true nature that they can effectively stifle intelligence if taken at face value.
   
4. Repairing the knowledge authorities by reconnecting with nature and understanding these root concepts as they truly are can restore and enhance our intelligence.
   
5. By teaching each other and sharing these repaired understandings, we can create a more meaningful, truthful, and active engagement with our minds, which are not mere recipients but arbiters of identity, meaning, and truth.
   
6. The collective power of a group of five individuals can be greater than any single nation or institution, and it is our responsibility to use our intelligence to transform human culture and address the challenges facing us.
   
7. To do this, we must actively engage with the world around us like detectives seeking clues, using our senses and intellect to navigate and understand our environment.
   
8. The message is a call to action for individuals to use their minds more wisely than the technologies that often dominate them, and to take an assertive and active role in shaping the future of human culture.

Checking Mistaken Identity： When Nouns Decieve.txt
1. **Myth of Survival**: The idea that the ultimate goal of nature is survival is a misconception derived from evolutionary biology. Darwin's contributions formalized this understanding, but it was later co-opted by industrial cultures, leading to various deceptions and misapplications.

2. **True Goals of Life**: The actual objectives of organisms and ecologies are complex and multifaceted, with survival being just one aspect. A more accurate view would emphasize symbiosis and interdependence, highlighting the importance of togetherness and mutual support.

3. **Individuality as a Fiction**: The concept of the individual is a fiction because no organism exists in isolation; every life form depends on countless others. This has profound implications for our understanding of identity and the nature of time.

4. **The Role of Time**: Time is a fundamental element that influences change and transformation, which are more significant than stability in the evolutionary process. Our language and thought patterns often prioritize stability over time, which can lead to a lack of insight and intelligence, particularly in group cognition.

5. **Vigilance, Ambiguity, Prediction**: These three aspects are central to human concerns and often hinder our ability to adapt and respond effectively to change. By rethinking our relationship with these elements, we can become more insightful and intelligent as a collective.

6. **Transformation of Humanity**: The definition of what it means to be human is evolving rapidly due to technological, cultural, and environmental changes. We may be becoming something fundamentally different from our previous understanding of humanity.

7. **Engagement and Support**: The speaker encourages listeners to engage with the content by considering new perspectives, sharing the videos, and supporting the work through Patreon, which allows for ad-free listening.

8. **Closing Thoughts**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to and adapting to the transformations in our world, cultures, and behaviors, as these changes are reshaping what it means to be human.

Checking Mnemonium 7： Memory and Intelligence.txt
1. Memory is not like a recording; it's an active, alive process, not something that can be fully captured or described by language or analogies. It's the essence of our personal experiences, the very nature of who we are as living beings.

2. When we try to explain memories through words, we're actually creating a skeletal structure of that experience using our waking mind, which is different from the actual experience of remembering.

3. The nature of memory is something that is directly accessible and can be experienced firsthand, rather than understood through scientific or religious frameworks.

4. Memory is likened to a mother figure we may have forgotten, implying an intimate and fundamental connection to our own being.

5. Dreaming offers access to this living door of memories, which is the source of all our thoughts, ideas, and creations. It's the origin from which everything else derives.

6. The quest to understand what memory is like is a journey into the very nature of existence, one that each person must undertake personally and directly.

7. The invitation is extended to explore this together, with the intention of discovering the essence of memory in a way that transcends all known concepts and language.

In summary, the speaker encourages an exploration of memory as a fundamental aspect of existence that is deeply personal and cannot be fully expressed or captured by our current understanding, languages, or sciences. It's an invitation to look within and find a connection to the essence of life itself through the direct experience of memory.

Checking Modes of Awareness ｜ Recursion ｜ Feedback.txt
 In this conversation, we explore the concept of consciousness facing itself, which is akin to meditation, where one observes the mind from a distance. This process can lead to insights about the nature of reality and our place within it. The dreaming aspect of awareness, often inward-facing, mirrors the world, suggesting that even in introspection, we can understand external realities.

The discussion touches on the TV series "The Prisoner," which deals with themes of consciousness and its recursive relationship with being. We recognize that humans and many other beings are constantly engaging in this process of self-reflection or "folding" consciousness back upon itself, which can sometimes lead to a sense of entrapment within the confines of our own minds or societal constructs.

The dialogue emphasizes that by observing the mind's patterns and learning to step outside the usual prison of ordinary thought, we can develop skills to navigate changes in consciousness, such as when the boundaries of our self-imposed prison start to dissolve. The ultimate goal for some is enlightenment, which involves recognizing the origin and nature of awareness itself.

The speaker reflects on their personal journey towards understanding the mind's workings, noting that while they have not fully reached enlightenment, they have gained valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and its potential to transcend its own structures. The speaker encourages a broader perspective on life, one that sees beyond the limits of our constructed realities, and invites listeners to join in the pursuit of understanding the true character of our existence.

The conversation concludes with a warm sign-off, wishing listeners a beautiful way, day, and dreams, and expresses anticipation for future learning and exploration together.

Checking My People ｜ The Siren ｜ Molting.txt
1. **Molting Analogy**: Slavoj Zizek likens the current phase of human civilization to an analog of molting in biological systems, suggesting that our species is due for a significant transformation or 'molt' that will be challenging and potentially destructive.

2. **Unpreparedness**: Humanity is unprepared for this transition, particularly due to the environmental damage we have inflicted upon Earth, which serves as our lifeline. Our actions have been like hacking at the umbilical cord that connects us to nature, essential for our survival and mental well-being.

3. **Global Warming and Climate Change**: While humans play a significant role in climate change, it's also part of larger natural cycles and transformations. However, by undermining Earth's protective systems, we have set ourselves up for dire consequences.

4. **Technological Hubris**: Zizek uses the analogy of replacing a dying human heart with a clock to illustrate the absurdity of trying to geo-engineer solutions to global environmental issues—a move that reflects both ignorance and arrogance.

5. **Potential Outcomes**: The conversation suggests that the future holds chaos and possibly an apocalypse due to the severe repercussions of our actions. Zizek's perspective is pessimistic, emphasizing the mechanical, physical consequences rather than any malicious intent from nature.

Checking NS Capture, Cats, Darwin's Actual Scope....txt
1. **Popcorn Machine Analogy**: Physicists Leonard Susskind and James Hartle proposed a model where the universe is analogous to a "popcorn machine" that creates bubble universes from a "universe progenitor field." Most of these bubbles collapse quickly because they don't have the right properties (i.e., they are not "viable"), while only the ones with finely-tuned constants and conditions persist.

2. **Fine-Tuning for Life**: The model explains why we find ourselves in a universe that appears finely-tuned for life. Since non-viable universes don't last, we wouldn't exist in them. This self-correcting mechanism naturally selects for universes that can sustain observers.

3. **No God Required**: The model is an alternative to invoking a deity to explain the fine-tuning of the universe. It's a naturalistic explanation, as it doesn't require a supernatural entity to produce the conditions necessary for life.

4. **Problems with Life's Origin**: Modern science struggles with explaining the origin of life on Earth, often due to doctrinal constraints that have led to the exclusion of intelligent design or meaningful intelligences.

5. **Request for Support**: The content creator expresses gratitude for the audience's engagement and support, encouraging viewers to like, share, and consider direct financial support through various channels if they wish to contribute to the continuation of the content.

In summary, Susskind and Hartle offer a scientific explanation for the fine-tuning of the universe that aligns with what we observe without invoking God or supernatural forces. They suggest that our universe is just one of many that are constantly being created, with only the most stable ones surviving to support complex structures like stars, planets, and eventually life as we know it. The creator of the video encourages viewers to engage with and support the content, emphasizing the importance of community and financial contributions in maintaining the creation of such content.

Checking Nature, Truthfulness & Constructs.txt
1. **Complexity of Truth and Perception**: JKM discusses the complexity of identifying with constructs like being American, and how our perception of truth is often influenced by layers of institutional narratives that can obscure our true essence.

2. **The Illusion of Concrete Facts**: He points out that science and technology have given us a sense of finality and accomplishment, but this can be poisonous to our humanity because it can stifle the development of our hearts and minds by presenting things as definitively 'true' when they may not allow for growth or change.

3. **The Dangers of Over-reliance on Facts and Constructs**: JKM warns that blind adherence to concrete facts or religious doctrine can both lead to a loss of our true selves, making us easily manipulated puppets of the very constructs we serve.

4. **Seeking Truthfulness Together**: He emphasizes the importance of intentionally creating a path toward truthfulness as a group, constantly correcting our course and checking in with our nature and essence to avoid being overtaken by destructive forces.

5. **The Process of Awakening**: JKM suggests that we all undergo 'deaths' as we are exposed to constructs and institutions from childhood onward, which can make us lose touch with our true selves, but also presents the possibility of an awakening where we become oriented by something beyond what the intellect can dominate.

6. **The Importance of Heart and Sensitivity**: He trusts in the infinite potential for truthfulness and values relationships over mere derivations of truth. JKM admits to being naive, vulnerable, and still confused but believes that vulnerability can be a strength if shared in ways that allow us to experience and express the precious endowments we all possess.

7. **Invitation for Reflection**: The talk is an invitation for listeners to reflect on their own lives, recognize patterns of loss or awakening, and consider how they might overcome the gravity of the constructed identities that have invaded their primordial essence, heart, and sensitivities.

In summary, JKM's talk encourages a deeper exploration of truthfulness, questioning the role of concrete facts and constructs in our lives, and inviting us to consider how we might align more closely with our true selves.

Checking Networks of Light.txt
 The speaker is describing a fascinating natural phenomenon they observed involving spider webs on the ground, which in the sunlight create a network of light that appears like moving stars. This intricate web of strands is difficult to capture on camera but is visible to the naked eye under certain angles. The speaker uses this observation as a metaphor for how our perception and purpose can shape our experience of the world. They suggest that there's an abundant amount of miraculous experiences and relationships all around us, but often, we fail to see them due to cultural impositions or a lack of wonder and curiosity.

The speaker is particularly struck by this observation in the morning, which has awakened their heart and inspired them to reflect on how we perceive and engage with our environment. They mention that the phenomenon is not just about spider webs but represents something much more interesting and complex, inviting us to explore the perspectives and purposes that shape our understanding of the world. The speaker also notes the presence of bees in a tree behind them and acknowledges the importance of recognizing and appreciating local wildlife. They end by expressing gratitude for the audience joining them in this moment of observation and reflection.

Checking Neuromorphosis - In Conversation with Lee Gerrard Barlow ( Part I ).txt
 In this conversation, Darren and Lee engage in a deep and reflective discussion about the pursuit of healing, amnesia, and the quest for understanding the origins and purposes of life, which they refer to as seeking the "nectar of our origin and purpose" under the framework of nemosonese.

Checking Normality - The Problem of Normalization.txt
1. Daniel Schmidt (DS) reflects on human consciousness and thought, emphasizing how technological advancements have offloaded the cost of awareness, making it easier for deception to propagate. He points out that our technologies protect us from the consequences of our unintelligent behavior that would typically be filtered out in nature.

2. DS highlights the difference between active sensing (deeply embodied and relational) and passive representation, noting that while humans can understand abstractions, true understanding comes from embodying these concepts. He stresses that active sensing informed by previously forged representations is crucial for survival in natural environments.

3. DS acknowledges the paradox of using abstract language to point beyond it, aiming to transcend the limitations of abstraction to connect with a deeper sense of learning and wonder alongside all living beings and intelligences.

4. He expresses his intention to use video content as a tool to enhance collective perception and learning, hoping to make incremental progress towards understanding our human incarnation more deeply.

5. DS emphasizes the importance of virtue, not as an adoption of a pre-fabricated moral framework but as a response to an experience of the universe's fundamental virtuous origin. He acknowledges the irony of humans being capable of perceiving the ecstatic beauty of the universe while still failing to live up to that vision in many aspects of their behavior.

6. DS is grateful for those who engage with his explorations and shares a sense of deep gratitude for the opportunity to learn together about the ways we are more than human, the fundamental wonder of our existence, and even the difficult experiences faced in contemporary times. He expresses his anticipation for continued learning and exploration.

Checking Normative Generalizations and Policing of ‘Norms’.txt
1. **Language and Knowledge**: The conversation begins with a reflection on language as a tool for understanding the world, but acknowledges its limitations in capturing the full complexity of human experiences. Knowledge is constantly evolving, and our understanding of concepts like gender and sexuality challenges traditional norms.

2. **Cultural Timidity**: Our cultures are too cautious in dealing with topics related to human sexuality. There's a fear that understanding the true diversity of human nature would disrupt societal notions of "normalcy." This leads to normative policing, which is problematic as it's based on averages and generalizations that don't account for individual differences.

3. **Shouldness**: The concept of "should" is critiqued as a potentially harmful aspect of human cognition, particularly in the context of social media, where it can lead to a "nightmare topic" of normative policing.

4. **Online Battlegrounds**: The speaker warns that online environments are becoming increasingly toxic and that the stakes for control over information and interactions are higher than ever. In the near future, we'll likely see unprecedented behavior from bad actors, including sophisticated cyberattacks and new forms of warfare.

5. **Human Uniqueness**: Each individual is unique, and our identities change with different contexts and relationships. The speaker encourages the creation of diverse and supportive environments that allow us to explore our true selves without being constrained by societal or cultural expectations.

6. **Call to Action**: The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of establishing positive, intelligent contexts together, suggesting that if we don't actively shape these environments, we risk falling into the negative aspects of culture and the internet, such as censorship and the "thought police."

The overarching message is a call for embracing diversity and individuality while being critical of rigid norms and the dangers of unchecked digital environments. It's an invitation to engage with language, knowledge, and each other in a way that fosters growth and understanding rather than control and suppression.

Checking Nothing to See ： There's No There, There (UFO⧸UAP).txt
 Terry Gilliam, a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, discusses the complexity of understanding human motivations and decisions. He points out that if we probe too deeply into why we do certain things, we may encounter a paradox where it seems like there are two separate entities within us—the doer and the questioner. This can lead to confusion and potential self-referential madness if not handled carefully.

Gilliam also touches on how this deeper understanding of self can be used to manipulate and destabilize individuals, making them unpredictable and difficult to categorize or assess as a threat. He suggests that due to the blurring of categories, adversaries no longer need large armies or direct confrontations to challenge more powerful nations like the United States.

He emphasizes the importance of staying awake and aware, as the tools we use to determine identity and maintain vigilance have been compromised by various forces, including media organizations driven by profit. Gilliam calls for unity and mutual assistance in tackling these issues, suggesting that we can learn to understand and respond to the complex problems we face, but it will require effort and cooperation among individuals. He concludes with a note of optimism about the potential for future learning and collaboration.

Checking Novelty.txt
 In this conversation, we explored the idea that modernity can lead to a sense of disconnection and a search for fulfilling roles or meaningful agency through various coping mechanisms. These mechanisms include intoxication, nervous habits, and even depiliation as a way to manage a feeling of impoverishment in self-relation, world-relation, and identity. We compared these modern compensatory behaviors to natural processes, like the yolk of an egg nourishing the developing chick, but emphasized that while these ancient traditions have inherent wisdom, they cannot be replicated or invented by simply mimicking their external forms.

We discussed the limitations of using psychedelic drugs as a direct path to enlightenment and the importance of honoring and respecting ancient traditions rather than trying to reinvent them. We also talked about the potential for creating new, virtuous ways to experience non-ordinary states that are informed by these traditions, while being mindful of their origins and maintaining an attitude of reverence and humility.

The conversation concluded with a message of gratitude and well-wishes for beautiful experiences in all aspects of life, emphasizing the importance of adventurous exploration and learning together. The speaker expressed a hope for future collaborations and shared moments of connection and understanding.

Checking Observation & Identity： The Origins of Sentinel Processes in Consciousness.txt
 This conversation is a reflection on the importance of meaningful social connections and positive social interactions for humans, especially considering how isolating and challenging modern life can be. The speaker discusses the origins of human behavior and intelligence from the need for positive attention during childhood, which shapes our learning and development. They highlight that many people suffer from negative attention during their formative years, leading to a lifetime of internalizing pain and judgment.

The speaker emphasizes that even in adulthood, when we're not surrounded by supportive individuals who act as nurturing parents or siblings, we can still cultivate positive self-care and create environments of harmony within ourselves. They suggest that by practicing self-compassion and redirecting our thought patterns away from fear, shame, anger, and self-criticism, we can gradually heal and find moments of well-being and freedom.

The speaker also shares personal experiences of isolation and how even established positive aspects of life can be eroded over time by adverse circumstances. However, they remain hopeful, encouraging the audience to remember the origins of our troubles and to explore directions toward healing, growth, learning, and freedom together.

The conversation is not just a lecture but a reminder for the speaker themselves about the nature of human struggles and the paths toward overcoming them. The speaker expresses gratitude for the audience's attention and kindness and looks forward to future opportunities to continue learning and growing together. They conclude by expressing deep appreciation for the shared journey and bid farewell until their next encounter.

Checking Observation ｜ Time ｜ Intent.txt
 In this conversation, the importance of direct, mindful, and heartfelt engagement with our surroundings is highlighted. The speaker reflects on how modern technology and our reliance on it often lead us to skip over intervals of time and space, missing out on the richness of direct experience and meaningful relations. This tendency to skip or fast-forward through life, as seen in the example of jet lag, has become pervasive, influencing every aspect of our existence.

Our technologies, which we often celebrate as conveniences, are primarily methods for bypassing opportunities for authentic interaction and presence. As we continue to develop new ways to skip over these intervals—whether physically, electronically, or temporally—we find ourselves increasingly immersed in a barrage of noise and superficial distractions. This leads to a paradoxical situation where we become deeply attached to representations of experiences we missed, such as clinging to physical objects or digital media that promise a return to those moments.

The speaker suggests that by engaging directly with our environment, like walking in a garden without the mediation of devices, we can reconnect with living temporality and foster meaningful relationships. Observing and being observed in a positive manner within a living ecosystem can facilitate transformative experiences and encourage a more mindful and intentional way of being.

In essence, the speaker is advocating for a more conscious approach to our interactions with the world around us, one that values presence, awareness, and meaningful engagement over the seductive but ultimately hollow conveniences of modern technology.

Checking Observation(s).txt
1. **Cultural Preservation through Martial Arts**: The Okinawan martial arts, Karate, not only serve as a means of self-defense but also as a cultural artifact that has been passed down through generations, encrypting the knowledge and techniques within its practice.

2. **Dual Nature of Martial Arts**: While martial arts can be playful and creative, they are fundamentally about combat and survival, where the primary objective is to incapacitate an opponent if necessary.

3. **Real vs. Idealized Combat**: In actual conflict situations, there are no rules like in sparring matches; it's a matter of neutralizing threats quickly because one can never be sure whether the fight will end peacefully or escalate to lethal levels.

4. **Training for Asymmetric Advantage**: Traditional martial arts train practitioners to strike with lethal force if needed, targeting vulnerable areas of the body like eyes, throat, groin, and limbs to ensure the opponent's inability to continue the fight.

5. **Women in Martial Arts**: Skillful women practitioners demonstrate that they could defend themselves effectively against threats, deterring potential aggressors through their capability.

6. **Social Media Example**: A social media video showing a woman thwarting a purse snatcher by flinging her purse and then riding away on the scooter he approached her with, illustrates an example of self-defense strategy in action.

7. **Conclusion**: The discussion highlights the importance of understanding the true purpose behind martial arts, which is not just about physical fitness or sport but also about self-preservation and the potential for lethal force in combat situations. It underscores the value of these practices as cultural heritage and personal empowerment tools.

The speaker expresses gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these topics and wishes viewers a beautiful life with meaningful relationships and opportunities. They look forward to continuing the learning journey together soon.

Checking On Original Participation in Owen Barfield's Saving the Appearances (a Study in Idolatry).txt
 In this video, the speaker discusses a profound and transformative experience of direct consciousness transfer from a species of wasps, which they describe as an instance of "original participation." This experience allowed the speaker to become one with the history and consciousness of the wasps, spanning what felt like millions of years in a single moment. The speaker emphasizes that such experiences were commonplace for our ancient ancestors but are increasingly rare due to the evolution of human consciousness, particularly with the onset of figuration and alpha thinking, which have led to a world dominated by dead knowledge—information that is disconnected from direct experience or participation.

The speaker suggests that the kind of knowledge we typically value in modern society is lifeless and impoverished because it lacks the vitality of direct, participatory experiences. They cite instances from their own life and others', such as Yana Rashil's experience of becoming one with a river, to illustrate this point.

The speaker also touches on the biblical narrative in Genesis, where the fruit of the tree of knowledge is associated with death—not physical death but a kind of spiritual or existential demise—due to its representation of a loss of direct experience and a shift towards dead knowledge.

The video concludes by highlighting the importance of original participation as a fundamental aspect of our humanity, which is often dismissed or pathologized by modern culture. The speaker acknowledges the risks involved in sharing such experiences, including potential societal rejection or even harm to the person sharing them due to the radical shift in perception that such experiences can provoke. The speaker invites viewers to reflect on these ideas and looks forward to engaging with the topic further in future discussions.

Checking One Animal as Many ｜ Multibird.txt
🦅 **Bird Behavior and Group Dynamics**: You observed a group of birds (including Blue Jays, robins, and others) interacting with each other and their environment in a complex social context. The birds exhibited a sophisticated network of sensing and communication, which benefits the entire group. This network allows for a diverse range of responses to threats, such as a dog, with some birds fleeing at the first sign of danger while others remain more courageous.

🐕 **Canine Encounter**: The presence of a dog triggered different responses among the birds, demonstrating their ability to assess and react to external threats. The birds' reactions highlight the importance of diverse sensing and threat detection within the group for an enhanced collective intelligence.

🌱 **Evolutionary Perspective**: The observed behavior is not new; it's a natural phenomenon that has evolved over billions of generations. These birds form a superorganism, hitchhiking on each other's curiosity and threat detection capabilities without any predefined rules. This shows the adaptive advantage of group living and collective intelligence in nature.

🤝 **Superorganism Concept**: The birds form a superorganism by leveraging the strengths of each individual within the group, creating a more robust and effective response to their environment than any single bird could achieve alone. This concept extends beyond birds to other animals like bees and ants, which also exhibit distributed intelligence in their colonies.

🎈 **Play and Learning**: Play is crucial for learning and developing intelligence in many species, including dogs. The behavior of the dog joining in the playful interaction with the birds further illustrates the importance of social dynamics and communication in animal intelligence.

In summary, you witnessed a real-time example of how birds interact within their groups to form a collective intelligence, adapt to threats, and demonstrate the evolutionary advantages of group living. This behavior is not only fascinating but also a testament to the interconnectedness and complex social structures found in nature.

Checking Oneirocritica ： The Dream Dictionary and Representational Cognition.txt

Checking Organisms, Spiderwebs, Assembly Theory.txt
1. **Assembly Theory**: This is a concept that suggests we can empirically determine whether an object or phenomenon was created without intelligent intervention. It proposes that there's a complexity threshold in the "assembly index" or "causal graph" of an object that indicates whether it could have originated naturally or required conscious design.

2. **Potential Impact**: Assembly theory has the potential to be as impactful as Einstein's relativity, possibly providing proof of intelligent design or transcendence in the universe. It could change our understanding of science and the nature of reality itself.

3. **Comparison with Other Theories**: There are similarities between assembly theory and other theories like Rupert Sheldrake's morphogenesis, which posits that certain patterns can be inherited or teleported without direct physical interaction.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: The discussion brings up ethical considerations reminiscent of Frederick Brown's story "The Weapon," where a scientist creates something potentially lethal due to the pursuit of knowledge without considering its consequences.

5. **Encouragement for Further Research**: The speaker encourages listeners to explore assembly theory further, as it may lead to significant discoveries or be definitively refuted, either of which would be important for our understanding of science and intelligence.

4. **Duplicitous Functions**: Unlike machines, human functions when united do not simply add up; they are complex and interdependent. The duplicity in our current social structures leads to outcomes that are the opposites of what they should be—harmful rather than beneficial.

5. **True Purposes and Unity**: If our purposes are aligned with genuine cooperation and mutual well-being, we can create a more authentic and unified society. However, if our purposes serve individual profit, power, or other self-centered agendas, the result is a society that is neither human nor intelligent.

6. **Rediscovering Unity**: We must rediscover the aspects of our intelligence that value unity and work towards creating analogies and experiences that lift us out of the confines of our current, often self-destructive patterns of thought and behavior.

7. **Philosophy and Science**: Philosophy and true science guide us toward a more unified understanding of ourselves and our place in the world, emphasizing the importance of analogical and holistic thinking.

8. **Avoiding Technological Dominance**: Instead of allowing technology to have the final say in how we live and think, we should harness it to enhance our human experiences and foster deeper connections with each other and our environment.

She offers hope that through collective action and a deeper understanding of our place in the cosmos, we can make a significant and positive impact on human history.

Checking Otopede 11： The Amphitheatre.txt
1. The conversation acknowledges the erasure of countless individuals who have been silenced throughout history, emphasizing that many did resist and were ultimately forgotten by history. This serves as a reminder of the potential for human intelligence and the tragic loss of that potential when it is suppressed or erased.

2. Ken Wilber and Terence McKenna discuss the importance of recognizing the true orientation of humanity, which lies in our relationships with nature and each other, rather than in the constructs of science or religion that often frame our understanding. They suggest that there is a frontier of human potential and intelligence that has been buried and needs to be unearthed.

3. The conversation highlights the need for humans to move beyond frameworks and definitions that limit our understanding of intelligence and to instead engage with each other in meaningful relationships and purposes that resonate with our true nature. It's about being and becoming human together, learning, growing, and discovering what it means to live authentically.

4. Wilber and McKenna call for a reorientation of the self—moving from a superficial "self on a shelf" to a deeper, more authentic expression of our birthright. This involves shedding the armor we've built up to survive in a world dominated by constructs and instead finding a context where we can truly personate and be genuine.

5. The invitation is to remember and discover ways of living that are older and truer, orienting ourselves in relation to each other, nature, intelligence, and learning. This involves dismissing fictional authorities and inner critics that have taken up residence in our minds and instead creating a space for beauty, truth, and meaningful connection.

6. The dialogue encourages a collective and personal rediscovery of a human art of orienteering together in life, language, constructs, and everything we do. The goal is to bring a living spirit back into the center of our existence and to trust this together, learning from each day and building upon our discoveries.

7. The conversation suggests that by clearing away the amphitheater of fictional authorities within ourselves, we can create space for something beautiful and true, and that this process of dismissing false judgments and embracing authenticity can begin today and grow exponentially with each passing day.

Checking Paradise 9： This is all the worlds..txt
 The text reflects on the nature of reality, perception, and consciousness, emphasizing that our true world and the only one we know is the one we are living in right now. It critiques how culture, language, media, and distractions often lead us to seek meaning, development, and understanding elsewhere, in far-off places or future times, rather than recognizing these searches as projections of our own experiences and potential. The author suggests that each of our earthly years can be seen as a life cycle with birth, growth, death, and rebirth, with our birth date marking a new beginning where we can transform previous cycles through awareness.

The author also considers the concept of reincarnation, proposing that we undergo new incarnations not in distant realms but here and now, within the living world around us. This perspective invites us to deeply connect with our immediate environment, to see the kingdom of heaven as at hand, and to recognize the profound relationship between ourselves and life on earth. The author argues that true understanding comes from direct experience and personal realization, not from external teachings or texts.

Ultimately, the message is that paradise is here, in the present moment, in our ability to see and know the world we are a part of. The author encourages us to open our eyes to the profound beauty and interconnectedness of existence, which is all we have ever sought in distant lands or futures. This realization can bring about a profound shift in perception, transforming our experience of life from one of seeking to one of finding, right where we already are.

Checking Paranormality vs Modernity.txt
1. **The Nature of Cognition**: Human cognition is powerful and can influence our perception of reality, often filtering out or rationalizing away experiences that don't align with our established worldview. This can lead to either imagining non-ordinary phenomena where they don't exist (craziness of hallucination) or being completely closed off to any such experiences (craziness of denial).

2. **Darren Brown**: The speaker mentions Darren Brown as an example of someone who has mastered techniques that can mimic seemingly supernatural abilities, yet the speaker acknowledges they don't know what Brown truly believes about the paranormal. Brown likely uses psychological and social techniques to create the illusion of magic but may personally dismiss the authenticity of such phenomena.

3. **The Speaker's View**: The speaker seems to be a pragmatist or an atheist, interested in the manipulation of human consciousness and the study of how our cognition shapes our reality. They express a fascination with the non-ordinary but also acknowledge the challenges in distinguishing between genuine experiences and well-executed deceptions.

4. **Personal Experiences**: The speaker shares a personal experience of feeling the spirit of trees in a park, suggesting that such subjective experiences are valid without necessarily ascribing to a belief in craziness. They emphasize the importance of questing for meaning and understanding together with like-minded individuals.

Checking Part 1 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
1. The beaver bundle, which is a central medicine bundle in Blackfoot tradition, represents a treaty agreement between humans and animals, with the animals imparting knowledge to humans.
2. This bundle is very old, potentially predating domesticated dogs by thousands of years, and may even be connected to Eniskim fossils found in Alberta, which are around nine to ten thousand years old.
3. The beaver bundle is fluid and evolves over time as new knowledge or items are added through experiences or encounters with animals or plants that humans have significant interactions with.
4. When a human has a spiritual experience with an animal, if the experience is deemed beneficial by the beaver bundle owner (the beaver man/woman), it may be incorporated into the bundle after being legitimized and validated through a ceremonial process involving transfer of items or knowledge from the beaver bundle itself.
5. The beaver bundle acts as both the embodiment of the original agreement between humans and animals and as a repository for significant spiritual transfers over time, making it a central hub of knowledge and ceremony in the Blackfoot tradition.

Checking Part 1： A Conversation With Mark K. Charlton-Davis.txt
 In this segment, the storyteller discusses their great-grandfather, who was both a farmer and a magician, with a particularly large vegetable garden. He worked full-time as a farmer but also pursued magic under the stage name Barnum Daly. His agricultural skills were remarkable, especially in growing squash and watermelons, which he entered and often won contests with. Despite his success in these areas, he was intimidating to the storyteller, who recalls being afraid of him due to his towering height and ice blue eyes. The great-grandfather was also a root doctor, which was consistent with his African religious practices, where everything in his house was covered with white sheets during ceremonies. He had been born into indentured servitude in South Carolina, possibly in the early 1900s, and had to eat from a pig trough as a child. The storyteller reflects on the unfair business practices that led to such servitude and the desire of others to acquire his valuable land. The conversation also touches on the history of debt-driven indentured servitude and the passing of this status from family to family, which was common during that era.

Checking Part 2 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
 The story you recounted is a Native American legend from the Lakota or possibly another tribe's bundle, which involves a group of people who come together in a camp and form a community. As winter approaches, they must split into smaller groups due to limited resources. The separation causes distress among the members, particularly the teenagers who find it difficult to part with each other.

To distract themselves from the sadness of separation, they engage in games, one of which is a hoop and arrow game where players attempt to pass an arrow through different segments of a ring to score points. Two boys end up with high scores and argue over who truly won. This argument escalates, leading to violence when one boy picks up a weapon and kills the other, reigniting the feud between their groups.

The story highlights human nature, our shared commonalities across different cultures, and how symbolic representations, like the hoop representing unity or division, can influence social dynamics and conflict. It also touches on the theme of loss and the emotional responses to it, as exemplified by the phrase "the snake man cried anyway," which suggests that despite the outcome of conflicts, there is an inherent human vulnerability and sorrow that persists.

The legend serves as a teaching tool, potentially conveying lessons about conflict resolution, the importance of unity, and the consequences of allowing divisions to escalate tensions. The dance with the hoop and stick in the Beaver Bundle, along with the song associated with it, is a reminder of these lessons and the cyclical nature of human behavior and social interactions.

Checking Part 2： A Conversation With Mark K. Charlton-Davis.txt
1. The speaker has mentally let go of being a Jehovah's Witness after a water baptism experience.
2. Before the baptism, the speaker felt constant mental interference from family members, particularly his mother and sister, due to strict adherence to Christian teachings and Jehovah's Witness beliefs, which forbade them from engaging in activities they perceived as potentially damning or severing relationships.
3. The speaker acknowledges that religions often exploit human psychological vulnerabilities, using threats of eternal damnation, social ostracism, and loss of familial relations to enforce adherence.
4. The Jehovah's Witnesses specifically targeted the speaker's age, baptizing him at 13 or 14, which made it irreversible and thereby ensured his commitment, leveraging the fear of missing out on salvation or being present during the apocalypse.
5. Eschatology, or the study of the end times, is a significant part of Jehovah's Witness beliefs, as well as other Christian denominations, and was used to pressure the speaker into baptism with the impending doom of Armageddon as a catalyst.
6. The conversation hinted at the recurring nature of apocalyptic events throughout history, both natural and human-induced disasters, and how these events are often interpreted or predicted by different religious groups.
7. The speaker will pause the conversation to return later to discuss further experiences in Africa.

Checking Part 3 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
1. The Blackfoot people have protocols around how to interact with animals and birds that enter their homes or space, which typically involve not harming them unless it's necessary for food or specific cultural practices.

2. In traditional Blackfoot living situations, like teepees, it was common to allow birds to fly in as an open policy, but this could lead to problems with pests. Modern homes are different and require a different approach to prevent infestation.

3. The story of the mouse that took residence in a beaver's bundle and later became beneficial by stealing tobacco from others is an example of the Blackfoot understanding of coexistence with animals.

4. In general, Blackfoot culture teaches respect for all life forms and the importance of having a good reason to take life, other than for food or specific cultural purposes.

5. Rattlesnakes are used as an example of the agreement between humans and animals because they have rattles that warn humans before they are threatened, allowing both parties to avoid conflict if possible.

6. The preservation of the rattlesnake's rattles is indicative of a well-kept agreement where humans respect the snake's presence and do not harm it unnecessarily. In places where this agreement is broken, rattlesnakes are losing their rattles, making them more dangerous to humans who cannot see them coming.

7. The rattlesnake's warning system is a demonstration of the broader Blackfoot understanding of interspecies agreements and the importance of maintaining harmony between different life forms.

Checking Part 3： A Conversation With Mark K. Charlton-Davis.txt
1. **The Incident with the Terrorists:** The narrator experienced an event where neighbors dressed in white robes came to their house due to a local tradition that required letting people pass through their property during a certain time of year. The narrator was instructed not to interfere, as it was believed that doing so could bring bad luck or even death. This incident involved a sense of vulnerability and the inability to protect one's property.

2. **The Lion Encounter:** Another night, while sleeping, the narrator felt the ground rumbling and heard a purring sound that they interpreted as a lion outside their house. The lion's presence was intimidating, making the ground tremble and snapping at the mud walls. This encounter highlighted the unpredictable nature of living close to wildlife and the fear it can instill.

3. **The Demonic Activity:** The narrator also faced challenges related to spiritual beliefs about their land. It was known for demon activity, where ancestors or spirits would gather and have a meeting that manifested as loud singing, laughing, and talking. This made the land unsettling, and it was confirmed that no one else would build there.

4. **The Encounter with a Black Mongo:** The narrator had another close encounter with death in the form of a black mongo, which is considered by some to be particularly dangerous. This snake came unusually close during a moment when the narrator was vulnerable and alone. The narrative emphasizes the ever-present risk of danger from both natural elements and spiritual forces in this environment.

5. **The Recurring Theme of Close Encounters with Death:** Throughout these stories, there is a recurring theme of close encounters with death and the supernatural. These experiences underscore the narrator's vulnerability and the omnipresent risks that come with living in such a setting, where natural and supernatural forces are intertwined with daily life. The narrative also touches on the cyclical nature of health crises and the reliance on traditional means of healing and cleansing, such as water.

Checking Part 4 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
 The narrator recounts their experience with Joyce Spoonhunter from the Blackfeet Nation, who invited them into the world of repatriation to negotiate bringing a beaver bundle back to the community from Harvard's Museum. After contacting Harvard and speaking with Emery-Victor Howe, the new repatriation liaison at the museum, the narrator was initially unsure how to proceed given the cultural and professional gap. However, through an act of goodwill, they brought two bottles of high-quality wine from Oregon as a gift, which surprisingly won over Emery, who was French and initially skeptical.

Emery, despite being married, developed a close rapport with the narrator and became deeply involved in teaching them how to navigate the legal complexities of repatriation claims. Her guidance proved crucial in crafting an argument that would counteract Harvard's potential objections. The narrator successfully used this knowledge to fight for cultural artifacts against other museums after that experience, thanks to Emery's mentorship and advocacy. This story highlights the personal and diplomatic skills necessary for successful repatriation efforts, as well as the impact a dedicated individual can have in facilitating such processes.

Checking Part 5 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
1. The beaver bundle was last actively maintained by two individuals, Adolf Hungry Wolf and Paul Rasker, both of whom were not part of the tribe that was more directly involved with the bundle, the Saulteaux Ojibwe. They had a teacher named Mike Swimsunder, who was the last person to continue the beaver bundle tradition after his parents passed away, and he eventually returned the bundle to the water in the 1960s, believing it was no longer needed.

2. In the mid-1990s, efforts began to revive the beaver bundle, which included a significant ceremonial song known as the "victory song." Alan O'Hara, who later became the caretaker of the beaver bundle at Harvard University, was instrumental in this revival process.

3. A group of elders from various tribes, including Carol and Tom, successfully retrieved the beaver bundle from Harvard in May 1996 after a period of negotiation and intense advocacy by several individuals. The transfer was not a lengthy process but required significant effort and dedication.

4. After the return of the beaver bundle to its rightful place, Alan O'Hara was transferred away, and Joyce Spoonhunter tasked the speaker with documenting the elders on their subsequent tour through Washington DC, New York, and Chicago.

5. The speaker used remaining GI bill benefits to accompany the elders on their tour, ensuring that the important cultural moments were captured and recorded. During this time, Carol Spoonhunter became the female elder for the beaver bundle, and she later taught Adrian, who would become the new caretaker of the bundle.

6. The speaker's involvement with the beaver bundle and its return to the community provided a deep sense of accomplishment and purpose, as it was a significant cultural achievement that ensured the continuation of an important Native American tradition.

Checking Part 6 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
1. The individual has experience in Blackfoot repatriation and has created a database of more than 4,000 museums worldwide with native collections. They have worked on projects to return these artifacts to their rightful tribes.

2. After personal initiatives for repatriation, the person received a contract from the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde and Oregon to recontact museums globally regarding their inventories of native collections.

3. The initial phase of this project involved going to Harvard University's Peabody Museum with an anthropologist named Lee Davis (now at Berkeley) to examine their collection.

4. A significant event occurred during the examination process when the person, while handling an artifact described as a stone pipe, experienced an intense and unexpected spiritual connection upon touch. This moment was so powerful that it almost caused them to lose consciousness. They managed to maintain control just long enough to place the item on the cart without dropping it.

5. The individual's work involves photographing items for documentation purposes, which is then shared with tribal elders to aid in the repatriation process and the writing of claims.

6. The person has previously lived in New York City on City Island and worked with various individuals and institutions on repatriation efforts.

Checking Part 7 - Ryan First Diver tells the story of the first Beaver Bundle repatriation from Museums.txt
The individual recounts an extraordinary experience they had while handling a stone pipe at a museum. Upon touching the artifact, they felt an intense electrical sensation that almost caused them to faint. This experience was accompanied by immediate onset of flu-like symptoms, which were so severe that they had to leave the museum and sleep for 14 hours to recover. Despite the discomfort, the individual found the encounter with the Hoopa people and their culture to be profoundly impactful.

The Hoopa tribe, located in Northern California's Trinity Valley, has a unique cultural complex that is distinct from their linguistically similar neighbors, the Karuk. This area is known for the convergence of the Trinity River and the Klamath River, where three different tribes with different languages but similar cultures and ceremonies coexist. The Hoopa tribe still maintains much of their traditional culture, language, and ceremonies, including preserving aspects of their heritage that have disappeared from official records over time.

The individual also notes the gender dynamics within the Hoopa tribe, where traditionally, men and women lived separately and came together only during specific times, such as the deer rut. This historical practice still influences contemporary Hoopa society, with gender roles remaining a significant part of their culture.

The story emphasizes the importance of preserving indigenous cultures and the impact of bringing back lost aspects of history on the community and its members. The individual expresses gratitude for being able to share these experiences and highlights how such cultural revivals can significantly alter education and the overall well-being of the community. The encounter with the Hoopa people and their artifacts has left a lasting impression, illustrating the living history and vibrant culture that continues to influence the tribe today.

Checking Passages from Sufism and Surrealism (Adonis) pp 134-136.txt
 Adonis, in "Sufism and Surrealism," explores the concept of writing as an experience of death in the Sufi sense—a death that transcends the social-external world for the sake of living fully within the universal internal world. He emphasizes that literary expression must go beyond the literal and conventional language to create a delirious language that reflects the delirium of experience itself. This delirious language is characterized by metaphor and figurative speech, which acts as a bridge between the finite and the infinite, the known and the unknown.

Adonis describes the Sufi understanding of language as intoxicated and ecstatic, reflecting the intoxication of the Sufi himself. This language is not bound by reason or conventional logic; instead, it speaks from a place of intuition and mystical insight. The images it creates are not mere illustrations or rhetorical devices but are primordial and reveal essential origins while also transcending tangible reality.

In the Sufi experience, poetry is an inquiry into the essence of man and existence, aiming to reshape both. The images in Sufi poetry are part of a larger dialectic between the divine and the human, the visible and the invisible. They encompass dreams, visions, shocks, and madness, which serve as profound means of expression that reveal deeper truths beyond rational understanding.

Adonis highlights that in Sufism, the unseen and the mystery are paramount, as they represent the origin of all visible things. The value of a poetic expression lies in its ability to reveal this infinite scope and the myriad of relationships it contains. In figurative language, the apparent is not the primary speaker or writer; it is the inner meaning that drives the expression. The Sufi is not the originator of the speech or writing but is themselves a manifestation of the thought and written about by the deeper meaning they seek to express.

In summary, Adonis presents Sufism as a transformative and transcendent approach to literature and expression, where language and images are tools for exploring and expressing the boundless nature of the soul and the universe. It is a pursuit that seeks to dissolve fixed forms and conventional structures in favor of a more profound, intuitive understanding of reality.

Checking Passages from Sufism and Surrealism.txt
 The passage from page 130 of "Adonis, Sufism and Surrealism" in the chapter "The Aesthetic Dimension" discusses the characteristics of Sufi writing and its profound influence on Arab poetical writing. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Beyond Linguistic Decoration**: Sufi poetry transcends mere language and decoration; it is a reflection of human emotions, thoughts, understanding, and interactions with the world. It is a form of consciousness and thought, where emotion and meaning converge.

2. **The Broader Scope of Existence**: Sufi poets consider external material reality as only one aspect of existence. They delve deeper into the internal dynamics of life, such as the roots, sap, and growth of a tree, rather than just its branches, leaves, and fruit. This approach allows them to express what is beyond the common knowledge and experience.

3. **The Nature of Truth**: The truth that Sufis seek is not confined to scientific or conventional forms. It is a mystery hidden within things, in their concealed world. Sufi writing aims to access this deeper truth through specific knowledge that transcends both science and convention.

4. **The Invisible vs. the Visible**: Sufi writing challenges the established social, religious, and political norms, advocating for a complete emancipation from their constraints. It seeks to liberate the internal, subjective dynamic of the world—including emotions, desires, dreams, and unconscious natural instincts—that goes beyond the culture of the body and the spirit as defined by these establishments.

5. **Two Types of Language**: The passage distinguishes between two kinds of language: one that is logical, direct, clear (associated with the established culture) and another that is effective, obscure, and figurative (associated with Sufi writing). The latter is not limited by form and is capable of both awakening and enriching reality.

6. **The Role of Myth and Symbol**: Sufi writing often employs myth and symbol to guide readers toward deeper truths and broader horizons. These elements serve as bridges between the apparent and the concealed, the visible and the invisible, and allow poets to both reveal what is unknown and reinterpret what is known.

7. **Poetry as Knowledge**: In Sufi poetry, ideas do not emerge in isolation but are situated within their relationships with inner realities. This approach enables the poet to discover new knowledge and recreate existing knowledge by linking it with the movement of the unknown and the infinite. On this level, poetry itself becomes a form of knowledge.

In essence, the passage argues that Sufi writing represents a transformative and holistic approach to understanding reality, one that transcends conventional boundaries and seeks to uncover the deeper truths of existence through a rich tapestry of symbolism, myth, and poetic expression.

Checking People and their Animals.txt
 The speaker reflects on the dynamics of observing regulars at a local lake where they often walk. They note how over time, one becomes aware of the patterns and characters that frequent the area, and how these observations can lead to assumptions about individuals based on appearance, which are often incorrect. The speaker uses the example of a man who walks his dog regularly alongside the speaker, suggesting that there might be a deeper connection or shared essence between the man and his dog, beyond mere physical resemblance.

The speaker then touches upon the complexity of human relationships and how people present different facets of themselves to others depending on the context—ranging from public to intimate interactions. They highlight how individuals often maintain a "costume" that can be functional and sometimes updated as they develop, serving as a protective layer in social interactions.

The speaker also discusses the challenges of accurately gauging another person's character or "soul" based solely on appearances, emphasizing the importance of testing one's intuitions to avoid falling into the trap of superficial judgments. They point out that beauty, wealth, and other forms of relational privilege can be misleading and potentially lead to misunderstandings or failed relationships.

In conclusion, the speaker suggests that humans have untapped capacities for deep connection and learning that are often limited by the specialized contexts in which we choose to engage. They express a hope that individuals will create opportunities to explore and express these capabilities more fully, leading to richer and more meaningful experiences.

Checking Perspective and Perception.txt
1. The speaker reflects on the challenging reality facing the elderly in Western societies, where they often feel invisible and undervalued by younger generations and society at large. This leads to a sense of being imprisoned within relationships where their needs and contributions are not recognized.

2. The discussion draws parallels with a Star Trek episode featuring Spock and his father Sarek, where Sarek's mental deterioration affects the entire starship, symbolizing how personal issues can impact the broader environment or society.

3. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empathy and care for the elderly, suggesting that a society that disregards its older members is fundamentally flawed. The speaker also touches on the generational divide where younger individuals may be so focused on their own issues that they fail to appreciate the value of their elders until it's too late.

4. The speaker expresses gratitude to the audience for their engagement and support, viewing their interactions as a form of community and shared intellectual curiosity.

5. The speaker invites listeners to subscribe, like, or comment on the content, encouraging dialogue and interaction. They also offer to pursue any questions posed by the audience.

Checking Phenological Engagement： Stow Lake Blue Heron Social Tree.txt
🔹 You observed a group of Great Blue Herons at Stowe Lake's Socia Tree, where they typically nest. The herons were engaged in various displays, likely related to establishing dominance and territories ahead of the breeding season. These displays included neck stretching, calling, and aerial chases, which are common behaviors among males as they assert their status and claim the best nests for mating and rearing young.

🔹 You noted that the largest male was particularly active in demonstrating his size and strength, essentially warning others of his readiness to defend his position within the hierarchy. This behavior is part of a complex social system among herons, which goes beyond simple dominance displays and involves combat as one aspect of their interactions.

🔹 The bird that was chased by the dominant male was not deterred and returned to the tree after being pursued twice. While there's a possibility of a third chase, it appears less likely at this moment. There are multiple nests in the tree, and these interactions will ultimately determine which birds will occupy them for nesting.

🔹 You also mentioned the timing of the activity, indicating that it was around the evening and that the birds' activity might decrease as the moon phase progressed (presumably towards night). You were interested in capturing the behavior for observation, acknowledging that the human interpretation of these actions as dominance-driven is a simplification of the complex social dynamics at play.

Checking Phenology, Time and Synchronization.txt
 The speaker reflects on the interconnectedness of time, life, intelligence, light, water, space, and time, emphasizing the mystery and beauty of these concepts. They share a personal story involving the discovery of Newts and a frog colony, highlighting the importance of nurturing relationships and celebrating humanity through acts of kindness, such as sharing food during times of scarcity.

The speaker also touches upon the phenomenon of photic driving, where behaviors or situations preserved in the nervous system can be felt beyond their original context, leading to perceptual experiences that challenge our ordinary state of consciousness. This is exemplified by the illusion of clouds moving away when one transitions from watching the ground move beneath their feet to looking at the sky, similar to how water appears to flow when observed for an extended period.

The speaker suggests that psychedelics can inhibit or catalyze features of our nervous system that maintain stability, potentially revealing other ways of sensing and perceiving that are more akin to dreaming than typical waking consciousness.

In a broader sense, the speaker invites listeners to consider a deeper connection with the living environment, including plants, animals, ecosystems, and the earth as a whole. They encourage embracing a way of thinking that aligns with our inherent nature as organisms and our shared humanity, which often diverges from conventional modern thought patterns.

The speaker concludes by expressing hope for collective remembrance and learning, advocating for a return to a more holistic and empathetic engagement with the world, as reported by the most trustworthy and true news sources—sources that are vastly different from the typical news media we encounter. They look forward to future opportunities to explore and understand this connection more deeply.

Checking Phyllia 0⧸1 ： Pollens： The Living Dusts ( Bees ？ Angels ).txt
 The passage reflects on the degradation of human intelligence and insight due to the pervasive influence of a dysfunctional media that prioritizes commerce, materialism, and objective quantification over the nurturing of life, ecological balance, and the authentic connection with the natural world. It draws a contrast between the modern human disconnection from the living environment and the traditional understanding of indigenous cultures, which harmoniously integrated with the natural world, including its non-human intelligences and forces.

The text suggests that humans have lost touch with the essence of life and intelligence, as found in the direct, personal relationship with the natural world and its inhabitants, like the bees. It implies that there is a profound, untapped connection between humans and other living species, one that holds the key to a deeper understanding of reality beyond current scientific or religious frameworks.

The author advocates for a reawakening to this lost spark of true knowledge, which can only be accessed by cultivating a sense of awe and direct experience with the living world. This reconnection promises an explosion of new insights that will surpass all existing human constructs, including our current understanding of science, religion, literature, and even magic.

In essence, the passage calls for a transformative shift from objectifying and commodifying life to a more holistic and reverent engagement with it, where humans recognize their role as allies and participants in the larger tapestry of existence. It is a call to recover our birthright of intelligence, not by mastering the world but by understanding and harmonizing with it.

Checking Physics as Information  ： The Irony of Science ： Nuclear War.txt

Checking Physics： The Problem of Function as Identity.txt
 The conversation revolves around the urgent need for humanity to shift its focus from the destructive pursuit of technological advancement to the cultivation of intelligent, benevolent, and ecologically sensitive societies. The speaker expresses concern that our current trajectory is one of omnicide—causing harm to ourselves, each other, and the Earth, which they liken to a rogue node in a network of living worlds. This destructive path is not sustainable and will inevitably lead to consequences similar to an immune system's response to a harmful infection.

The speaker argues that we have misdirected our evolutionary potential into technological development without simultaneously working towards the creation of intelligent, compassionate human societies. They emphasize that the true essence of humanity—our dreams and the fulfillment of our incarnation on Earth—is being ignored in favor of machines and weapons.

To address this crisis, the speaker suggests that we need to redirect our efforts and invest in the development of societies that are wise, peaceful, and empathetic. This would involve a radical transformation of how we live, govern ourselves, and interact with each other and the natural world. The goal is to become what we truly are—intelligent beings capable of meaningful relationships with all aspects of existence.

The speaker invites others to contribute ideas on how to initiate such a profound societal shift and looks forward to collaborative exploration and learning towards this end.

Checking Potemkin 19： Identity： Self and Mind.txt
 Terry's reflection here touches on the collective nature of human knowledge and cultural heritage, suggesting that much of what we consider our individual self is actually a compilation of acquired elements from history and society. He questions the extent to which these aspects of self are truly "mine" or "me." Terry emphasizes that our sense of individuality is minuscule compared to the vastness of our shared human experience and suggests that our current models of selfhood are limiting, often leading to confusion and a disconnect from our true nature.

He proposes that our usual existence is largely disconnected from the profound potential of our intelligent beings to operate in a state of fluid relationality, which he experiences as more fundamental than the constructed identities we hold. These deep experiences transcend language and culture, revealing a direct connection with life itself.

Terry advocates for an approach to understanding ourselves that is rooted not in fictional representational paradigms but in the natural world and the authentic interactions between beings. He believes that even when we come together for seemingly invented purposes, there is an inherent potential for deeper connection and mutual growth.

He also notes that in genuine union with another person, the boundaries of one's own mind dissolve, suggesting that our minds are not solely ours but belong to the collective "we." Terry encourages us to pursue these questions together, aiming to explore what it means to be alive, intelligent, and human beyond the constraints of cultural costumes and preconceived notions.

In summary, Terry is inviting us to consider a broader, more interconnected view of the self, one that recognizes our shared origins and the potential for unity and understanding beyond the constructs of individual identity. He calls for an exploration of this together, as a collective endeavor, in the pursuit of a deeper connection with each other and with life itself.

2. The human experience involves an innate desire to explore and realize the network of interconnected minds, which can lead to profound personal growth and understanding.
3. Our current era presents both great opportunities and challenges, with darkness (challenges) being more visible than the light (opportunities).
4. Personal goals are often directed towards achieving desirable outcomes, but underlying these surface-level aspirations are deeper purposes and essences that each individual carries into life.
5. The fulfillment of these deeper purposes can lead to meaningful experiences and a sense of becoming who one truly is, which can happen in small, intimate group settings or even individually.
6. The author expresses a desire to explore and engage with these deeper aspects of human experience and to encourage others to do the same, emphasizing the importance of mutual support and understanding in the process of self-discovery and growth.

Checking Prediction.txt
1. **Socioeconomic Stratification and Prediction**: The discussion begins by noting how environmental issues affect different socioeconomic classes differently, with wealthier individuals having more protection from the consequences of these issues. However, everyone is ultimately trapped in a "Potemkin village" where the facade of stability and control masks the underlying reality.

2. **Historical Context**: The conversation shifts to how prediction, which once offered new freedoms in specific domains, has led to the tokenization and iterative limitation of living novelty. This has resulted in a focus on utilitarianism and authoritarian control as predictions become more "accurate" through the elimination of potential roles, activities, and creativity.

3. **The Illusion of Predictive Power**: The apparent reliability of predictive faculties is an illusion; they are actually a series of inhibitions and losses that mask their true nature as amputations of potential. This has led to a belief in the omnipotence of prediction, which is far more limited than it appears.

4. **The Role of Language**: Language is likened to a game or toy that can be played, but we must not be played by it. Preserving the unknowables and the mysteriousness of the universe through acknowledging the incompleteness of language is crucial for maintaining a connection with reality beyond what language can capture.

5. **Personal Relationships and Modern Life**: A similar insight to that regarding language should be applied to all aspects of modern life, including technology, ideology, religion, societies, nations, and medicine. This approach allows us to use these elements without becoming their function or victim.

6. **The Scope of Prediction**: The apparent omnipotence of prediction is deceptive; its actual scope is much narrower than it seems. It focuses on what it succeeds at and ignores its failures, giving an inflated impression of its capabilities.

7. **Meaning and Language**: Words do not have fixed meanings; they are tools used by humans to convey meaning. Being aware of this can lead to a deeper understanding of our own nature, which is beyond the reach of any word or concept.

8. **Liberation and Learning**: The ultimate goal is to liberate ourselves and future generations from ancient traps that have long constrained human potential. The speaker sees value in the attempt to communicate this message and looks forward to further learning and exploration together with the audience.

Checking Privacy ： The Disappearing Necessity.txt
1. The current trajectory of technology and data analytics is leading towards a loss of privacy, which could result in a dystopian future where individuals have nowhere to hide from oppressive surveillance.
2. To counteract this, we need to develop altruistic, humaneering systems that protect our personal data and analytics from being exploited or captured by malicious entities.
3. The Knowledge Amp is a proposed solution that includes:
   - A browser that mimics human thought processes and uses personal analytics to provide tailored, opportunistic results.
   - A device to store personal analytics securely with strong encryption, ensuring privacy.
   - A barrier between the user and the external internet for traceless interactions.
   - A data cache (CAW) that allows users to search the internet from the perspectives of historical or famous figures, using AI to create analytic images of their minds.
   - A verity sentinel to intelligently vet information for authenticity and reliability.
   - Social networking capabilities for forming teams to solve problems, with anonymity and avatars linked to personal analytics storage.
4. The most crucial aspect is maintaining the privacy of our data, as the loss of this sacred right could lead to enslavement and the erosion of what it means to be human.
5. The future of humanity may hinge on forming small, intelligent teams dedicated to exploring and discovering new potentials, beyond the limitations imposed by representational cognition.
6. There is an urgent need for individuals who are willing to work together to protect privacy and understand its importance in preventing a totalitarian future.
7. If you find these ideas valuable, consider supporting them through likes, shares, and contributions on platforms like Patreon.

Checking Qualia ： 5： Wave, Nucleation, ‘Individuals’.txt
 The wave-particle duality of light is often used as a metaphor to illustrate the complexity of understanding the nature of reality, particularly how observation and consciousness influence the manifestation of phenomena. This concept can be extended metaphorically to our interaction with language, consciousness, and identity, especially in contexts that require us to determine events and responsibilities, such as modern American justice.

In these contexts, there's a tendency to fix values, relationships, and identities in a frozen state to analyze them retrospectively. However, this approach neglects the dynamic nature of identity and the impact of our purposes on how we perceive and understand reality. It's as if we're collapsing the wave function of potential outcomes into a single state for the sake of comparison or prosecution, rather than acknowledging the fluid and evolving nature of identity and context.

The alternative approach is to recognize that identities and values are not static; they can be understood in a developmental, forward-progressing manner that takes into account the ongoing process of how we frame and collapse our experiences. This approach allows for a more intelligent, human, and humane understanding of behavior and events, one that focuses on learning, growth, and the potential for change rather than merely assigning fixed roles of responsibility or victimhood.

In essence, the wave-particle duality metaphor suggests that our consciousness plays a significant role in determining how we experience reality. We can choose to collapse our experiences into fixed states (the particle aspect) or to recognize and explore the ongoing process and potential (the wave aspect). The latter approach is more aligned with the true nature of reality, where intelligence and purpose guide our understanding and interaction with the world.

In summary, the wave-particle duality metaphor reminds us that our perception of reality is not just a passive reception but an active process shaped by our purposes, intentions, and chosen frameworks. By being aware of these influences, we can engage more intelligently with the world, leading to outcomes that are more reflective of the complex, dynamic nature of existence.

Checking Qualities ： Scope and Reference.txt
 In this monologue, Jordan Peterson discusses the concept of memeplexes—complex structures formed by interrelated memes (cultural units of information) that behave similarly to living organisms in terms of reproduction, territorial acquisition, and competition for dominance. He suggests that human cognition is influenced by these memeplexes, which can overshadow our awareness and potentially inhibit our true potentials and the richness of our experiences.

Peterson reflects on how we often exchange tokens or artifacts as proxies for deeper values and relationships, which he believes are capable of fostering incredible intelligence, intimacy, wonder, and play. He posits that these potentials exist deep within us, even if they are currently inhibited by the structured narratives and language we frequently engage with.

He emphasizes the importance of understanding and nurturing different species of mind-like entities within our culture, aiming for more beneficial, humane, intelligent, and embodied versions of these phenomena. Peterson expresses a deep commitment to remembering and honoring the dreams and struggles of all beings who have lived on Earth and transforming how humanity evolves and interacts with its own representational cognition.

He invites his audience to seek passionately, hopefully, to understand our history and present situation, and to unlock the potentials inherent in being human. Peterson's message is one of hope for a future where we can better manage the influence of our cultural constructs and live more fully and authentically.

In summary, Jordan Peterson encourages us to recognize and cultivate the rich, living potentials within ourselves and our culture, which are currently overshadowed by rigid and potentially harmful memeplexes. He sees an opportunity for humanity to evolve and improve, guided by a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between human consciousness and cultural evolution.

Checking Questions and Quests.txt
 In this monologue, Jordan Peterson discusses the nature of human quests and adventures. He explains that being human allows us to pursue unique personal endeavors, such as Alex Honnold's free climb of El Capitan, which no one had done before. Peterson shares his own quest: to understand the thoughts and perceptions of our distant ancestors when they gazed at the night sky, an experience rather than just intellectual knowledge. He emphasizes the importance of experiential and intimate knowledge, seeking to connect with the essence of things without being consumed by them.

Peterson touches on the risks associated with pursuing one's quests, noting that these risks can lead to rewarding fulfillment. He mentions Eric and Brett Weinstein, who frequently embark on their own intellectual and social quests. Peterson expresses a desire to comprehend the minds of various living beings, such as trees, bees, and the sea, suggesting that learning is often more effective when done collaboratively with others who share our curiosity and passion. He concludes by highlighting the benefits of having companions in our quests, as long as they bring their own unique perspectives and complement our own.

Checking Recovering Human History from Within ⧸ Origins of Colonization.txt
 In this monologue, Charles Eisenstein discusses the concept of an "interior extinction event," which refers to the loss of our inner vitality and connection with nature due to the influence of a dominant culture that prioritizes materialism and technological advancement over human well-being and ecological balance. He emphasizes the importance of reconnecting with our innate, life-affirming qualities and the wisdom of mothers as examples of deep, life-giving connection with nature.

Eisenstein suggests that many current societal issues, including environmental destruction and the erosion of human spirit, are symptoms of a deeper malaise caused by detaching from our natural state of being. He advocates for recovering our lost potentials and finding ways to counteract the forces that have led humanity away from values like memory, humanity, insight, virtue, mutual intelligence, and mutual concern.

He calls for collective action to oppose forces that undermine our ability to discern change and to protect our interior assets—our senses and our capacity to notice what is truly happening around us. Eisenstein encourages listeners to engage in communal effort, intelligence, resilience, and activity to heal from the damage done by a society that has prioritized short-term gains over long-term well-being.

In conclusion, Eisenstein invites his audience to join him in seeking better ways of seeing and to strive for a future where we can live harmoniously with ourselves, our ancestors, our progeny, and all life on Earth. He expresses gratitude for the listeners' attention and curiosity and hopes that together, we can find joyful relations, heal, and thrive.

Checking Reflections and The Material Universe.txt
1. The concept of the universe being mostly one unified field that rapidly transitions into distinct forms, which we perceive as separate objects and beings, is discussed. This idea suggests that what we experience as a solid, distinct world could actually be an illusion created by these rapid transitions.

2. The analogy of a toy that collapses into unity and then flashes back into individual form with all their unique information shared is used to illustrate how our perceived reality might operate on a much faster timescale than we can perceive, making it seem continuous and solid.

3. The reflection phenomenon in water is mentioned as an example of how humans have tried to capture and make permanent what was once transient, paralleling the human desire for physical immortality and the incarnation process of life.

4. The idea that limiting the lifespan of organisms is a beneficial innovation for life, which continuously creates new forms to accommodate different essences or souls throughout time.

5. A reflection on how video technologies and other recording devices are inspired by our understanding of reflection, and how they mirror the human fascination with capturing and preserving moments in time.

6. The discussion emphasizes that memory is not a recording but an active process of the brain, and the physical universe might be a reflection of something beyond time and space, which is expressed through the variety of life forms and their interactions.

7. The speaker encourages the audience to consider these ideas as enlightening, provoking, and inspiring reflections on our understanding of reality and the nature of existence.

Checking Reflections： Ideas and Suppositions.txt
 In this reflection, the speaker discusses the nature of habits and thought patterns that often dictate our behavior and perception of good and bad, just and unjust. These internalized norms can become so familiar that they trap us in repetitive and sometimes unsatisfying cycles. The speaker suggests that these traps are not necessarily physical but mental, arising from the mind's tendency to default to familiar patterns.

The speaker poses a question from their son: why do we trust our minds, which are inherently insecure and prone to error? This question is meant to provoke thought and exploration, encouraging us to look beyond the limitations of our daily mental processes.

The speaker emphasizes that if we do not achieve freedom within our minds, the physical freedoms we experience may feel empty or meaningless. They argue that liberation is a path rather than an achievement, and it's one that can lead to a more profound understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.

The speaker suggests that even if we are not actively seeking ultimate liberation, recognizing and releasing ourselves from mental traps can enrich our lives and help us navigate the complexities of our existence more effectively. They express hope and aspiration for collective learning and growth, leading to healing, nourishment, and a deeper appreciation of our minds, humanity, and essential nature.

The speaker concludes with gratitude for the audience's company and looks forward to continuing this journey of discovery together in the future. They sign off, wishing everyone well and inviting them to join again soon.

Checking Relation(ship) ｜ Living Places.txt
1. **Minds as Networks**: Terry de Gunzburg suggests that minds should be understood not as isolated, local phenomena but as network phenomena, interconnected with other living beings, much like how our current technology forms networks (e.g., television and radio stations). This view implies that minds are a product of the networks they belong to.

2. **Communication Among Minds**: The common dichotomy in human thought presents two extremes: one that denies any communication between minds except for formal methods like text or email, and another that accepts telepathy as a possibility. Terry acknowledges the existence of some form of mind-to-mind connection, though it's often misunderstood or overlooked due to its intimate nature and the difficulty in scientifically studying such phenomena.

3. **Intimacy and Mind Sharing**: The most apparent instances of what we might call telepathy occur in intimate contexts with people we are close to. This form of communication is not well-studied within clinical settings but is a significant part of personal relationships.

4. **The Limitations of Science**: Terry points out that our scientific understanding of minds and their connections is currently as rudimentary as discovering two new plants on Earth. The true nature of mind connectivity is likely much more sophisticated and complex than what we can currently imagine or measure.

5. **Participation in Mind Networks**: Children and those in love often intuitively participate in the networks of minds without needing to understand them fully. As adults, we might need to cultivate a conscious awareness to engage with this aspect of our existence.

6. **The Beauty of Mind Networks**: Terry emphasizes that the interconnectedness of minds is ecstatically beautiful and diverse, akin to the rich biodiversity found in natural ecosystems. Participating in these networks can be transformative and deeply enriching experiences.

Checking Remains of a Raptor Kill at SF Botanical Gardens.txt
You discovered a kill site in the botanical gardens near the frog pond, where a raptor has recently fed on what you believe to be a pigeon. The remains at the site are primarily composed of inner feathers, including some golden ones, which are characteristic of pigeons. While there are no bones visible, the presence of these feathers and the lack of decomposition suggest that the meal was recent. You find this phenomenon particularly striking because the day before, the stump where the remains were found was bare. Your observation indicates that the raptor selected this specific location to consume its prey, which is an example of how these predators can dramatically alter a landscape, even if temporarily, with their hunting activities. This observation is a valuable data point for those interested in the behavior and ecological impact of raptors in urban environments.

Checking Rememberer.txt
 Terence McKenna discusses the concept of knowing versus knowledge, emphasizing the importance of direct sensory experience over categorization and representation. He highlights how language and categorizations can oversimplify the unique nature of each individual and the world around us. McKenna argues that in our scientific age, we risk losing touch with our innate capacity to sense and perceive the richness and mystery of existence.

He touches upon the topic of women and their role in society, expressing discomfort with the idea of women as property, while also recognizing the distinct qualities and potential that each individual embodies. McKenna advocates for maintaining a sense of ambiguity and wonder, which allows for greater intimacy and connection with the world and all its beings.

He speaks about the interplay of light and shadow, representing the cycles of knowledge and mystery, and the importance of not losing sight of the beauty and interconnectedness of life. McKenna expresses his affection for all living beings, viewing them as friends, companions, and sources of inspiration and love. He concludes by wishing sweet and beautiful paths for those who join him in appreciating the world's mysteries.

McKenna also mentions the transient nature of experiences, such as the sight of the moon, which can serve as a reminder of our connection to each other across time and space. He encourages embracing the living adventure of being embodied and to find unity in diversity through direct perception and experience.

Checking Remembering.txt
1. **Expanded Consciousness**: The speaker reflects on the idea that they have acquired new dimensions of awareness and perception, beyond just the conventional waking consciousness. They acknowledge their own identity as Darren but question if this is merely a small part of a much larger, interconnected network of beings and experiences.

2. **Dreams and Reality**: The speaker ponders the nature of dreams, suggesting that the distinction between real and unreal experiences might not be as clear-cut as commonly thought. They propose that the world we perceive when awake could have its origins in our dreaming experiences, which are different modes of consciousness that we may not fully penetrate or understand.

3. **Waking Consciousness as a Mode of Dreaming**: The idea is presented that waking consciousness might be a unique form of dreaming that we take for granted as the "real" world, while our dreams are considered less real or even unimportant. However, both waking and dreaming experiences could be different facets of a larger reality that an aware being—who is also all beings—experiences.

4. **The Reality of Dreams**: The speaker emphasizes that dreams are no less real than the physical world in terms of our subjective experience; they are just different. The paralysis of the body during REM sleep, when most dreaming occurs, is noted as a phenomenon that attests to the reality of dreams within the context of personal experience.

5. **Desire for Lucidity**: The speaker expresses a longing for lucid awakening, where one becomes aware that they are dreaming while still dreaming. This lucidity is desired not just for its own sake but as a key to understanding a deeper reality and to becoming more conscious or awake in a broader sense.

6. **Engagement with the Question**: The speaker invites listeners to join them in exploring these ideas further, suggesting that by doing so, they can remember and recognize their experiences more clearly, whether in waking life or in dreams.

In summary, the speaker is grappling with the concept of reality and how our perceptions of what is "real" are shaped by our conscious state—whether awake or dreaming. They advocate for a more integrated understanding of consciousness that includes both states as manifestations of an underlying reality.

3. The process of relating to other living beings involves overcoming cognitive barriers and preconceived notions, allowing for a more profound connection and understanding.
4. Identities are not fixed points but rather fluid entities that can be influenced by how we engage with them.
5. In the specific context of the garden, a bird named Ivaros is acting as a sentry, particularly alert to protect its mate's eggs from local threats, including other birds.
6. The importance of reputation and the spread of influence through deep relations with other living beings is significant, and much about this remains unknown and unlike human conceptualizations.
7. Engaging with the world in this way can unlock our creativity, beauty, and the resonant ancient aspects of our humanity, suggesting that a deeper understanding of our place within the web of life can be transformative.
8. The speaker expresses gratitude for the audience's company and looks forward to continuing the exploration and learning together in the future.

Checking Resonance.txt
 It seems like you are describing a deeply metaphorical and introspective experience involving the interplay of natural reflections, such as those found in water, with the concept of emanation—the idea that one thing can originate or flow from another. You're highlighting how these patterns in nature can be seen as a form of communication or resonance, and you're drawing a parallel between the emanations in the water and the presence of an observer, which in this case is your own reflection.

You're emphasizing that while you could capture this interaction on video, the observer's layer (your personal perspective) cannot be directly shown or recorded within the media itself. The recursive nature of your description suggests a meditation on the act of observation and how our presence influences what we perceive in the natural world.

In summary, you're conveying a reflective and philosophical moment where the observer (you) is an integral part of the scene being observed, and this interaction between seen and unseen, observed and observer, is a fundamental aspect of understanding the world around us.

Checking Ric ： Est.txt
 The poem is a complex and vivid narrative that weaves together themes of violence, justice, and intimacy with technology and media. It speaks of swallowing the "fertile eye" of destruction, symbolizing the acceptance or internalization of war and its aftermath. The "malignancy's eye of the bombs" represents the malevolent intent behind weapons, which are described as "clean bombs," perhaps suggesting a sense of deception in their destructive nature.

The poem personifies bullets as the best embodiment of one's name, implying that violence can be both an identity and an expression of need. It also touches on the idea of a romantic or intimate connection with death and destruction, as the speaker desires to become the "explicit gift boxes" of justice, suggesting a twisted form of devotion or martyrdom.

The "doomed petals" symbolize the fleeting nature of life, particularly in the context of a violent act or war, and the "associated blood of the media's livid corpse" hints at the sensationalist and sometimes gratuitous portrayal of violence by the media.

The poem uses vivid imagery to describe a violent act, with the speaker's "heavy curse" manifesting in an explosion that occurs when someone's silhouette kisses the gun—an act that triggers the deadly chain reaction. The "permanent, chewy flower" within the dead and the schoolroom represents the lasting impact of such an event, with the speaker's lips and the character's rise from the "media's livid justice" symbolizing the catalyst for the explosion.

Throughout the poem, there are references to "privilege," "prison," and "primate," which could be interpreted as commentary on societal roles, power structures, and human nature. The gun is personified as both a tool and a trick, bearing labels that are ultimately deceptive or misleading ("privilege stop," "prison stop," "primate").

In summary, the poem is a meditation on the intersections of violence, justice, and identity, with a focus on how media and societal structures shape and perpetuate cycles of destruction. It uses a blend of metaphorical and literal language to challenge the reader to consider the complexities and consequences of violence and its representation in the modern world.

 The discussion revolves around the cultural and linguistic diversity among indigenous tribes in California, particularly focusing on the Hupa, Karuk, and Yurok tribes. These tribes, despite speaking different languages from distinct language families, share a common set of cultural practices and ceremonies. This example was used by Franz Boas to challenge the idea that there is a connection between culture and language. The speaker also shares anecdotes about their experiences with cultural practices, such as the significant role of deer in Hupa culture and the specific timing for men and women to cohabit, which affects the social status of children born during this time.

The tribes' traditional villages have undergone changes over time, with some features disappearing and others remaining intact. The speaker emphasizes the importance of these cultural practices and the impact of their work in bringing back forgotten aspects of their heritage, which has had a profound effect on the community and education within the tribes. They express gratitude for the opportunity to share these stories and hope to continue the conversation about indigenous culture, language, and history.

Checking SHOUJO： Nature, Ecology, and Omnicide： We Must Intervene, Now.txt
1. **Critique of Culture**: Terence McKenna emphasizes the importance of stepping outside of human culture to reclaim our animalian nature and intelligence, which has been overshadowed by technological advancements and consumerist behaviors. He warns against blindly following cultural memes and trends, as they often perpetuate harm and ignorance rather than fostering genuine activism or ecological preservation.

2. **Ecological Imperative**: McKenna underscores the significance of ecologies as the most vital assets on Earth and as integral to our own bodies and minds. He advocates for immediate and intelligent action to protect these ecosystems, which are under threat from human activities.

3. **Intelligence of Nature**: He invites individuals to become agents of nature's intelligence, offering a profound connection with the natural world that surpasses human culture. This connection promises experiences that are more beautiful, educational, and transformative than any cultural or technological distraction.

4. **Action and Alliance**: McKenna calls for collective action to defend the Earth's ecologies and to alleviate the suffering of other living beings. He offers his personal support as an ally in this endeavor, encouraging individuals to reach out to him for guidance and to join forces in a shared mission to rescue and restore life on Earth.

5. **Urgency and Opportunity**: The message is one of urgency—if we do not act now to protect the living environment, we risk becoming too stupid, too sick, and too broken to have the opportunity to do so in the future. It is a call to seize the moment and reclaim our rightful place as intelligent beings in harmony with nature.

In summary, Terence McKenna's message is a rallying cry for an immediate and profound shift from human culture-centric living to a life in symbiosis with the Earth's ecologies, leveraging our innate intelligence to benefit all forms of life and preserve the richness of our planet.

Checking San Francisco： The Ravens Have Changed.txt
 The behavior of birds, particularly crows and ravens, has noticeably changed in many urban areas. These birds appear to be more courageous and less concerned with the proximity of humans. They are exhibiting bolder behaviors such as foraging near or even amidst humans without fear, which was not typical before. This change could be attributed to a perceived shift in human dominance or behavior patterns. For instance, ravens are now approaching people indifferently, and one was observed openly eating from a red packet without concern. Furthermore, crows have been seen rummaging through garbage cans during daylight hours, a behavior usually reserved for nighttime or times of less human activity. This newfound confidence has led to birds also displaying unusual vocalizations, with some singing at times and in conditions not previously observed. The rapid shift in the birds' interactions with humans suggests they are acutely aware of environmental changes and are adapting accordingly. This transformation is both surprising and hopeful, as it indicates a potential for wildlife to quickly adapt to changing human dynamics within their shared environment.

Checking Sarah Janes and Lee Gerrard Barlow ： Mesmeric Dreaming.txt
1. **Bio-resonance and Energy Work**: Lee discusses bio-resonance as a form of energy work that can harmonize energy fields between individuals, potentially leading to empathetic connections where one might feel another's sensations by using devices called "emotion amplifiers."

2. **Cleansing Methods**: While working closely with others, it's important for practitioners to maintain their own balance and awareness through present moment awareness practices. Traditional cleansing methods are available but may be less necessary if one is adept at maintaining balance.

3. **Dream Quality and Sleep**: The practice of present moment awareness can influence dream quality and sleep patterns, as it shifts focus from the lunar (emotional) aspect to the solar (electrical) aspect of our being. On some occasions, practitioners might choose to enhance or diminish their dreams depending on their personal goals or the nature of their work.

4. **Alchemy in Healing**: The alchemical process in healing can involve working with different elements and aspects of ourselves, such as the wet (emotional) versus the dry (intellectual), and knowing when to engage with each to facilitate healing or personal growth.

5. **Lee's Offer and Gratitude**: Lee offers to record their conversation for Sarah to share with others, and they express mutual appreciation for the opportunity to connect and discuss these topics.

6. **Future Collaboration**: They also look forward to future events, such as Lee's involvement with the British Museum and invites from Sarah to visit in Greece.

2. **Observation of a Mantis**: The speaker recounts an experience observing a mantis that instinctively recognized a potential threat—a human—and used a drop of water to incapacitate the individual without harm, demonstrating an understanding of friend and foe. This illustrates the profound capabilities of even the smallest creatures in the natural world.

3. **Natural vs. Civilizational Strategies**: The speaker contrasts the instinctive intelligence of nature with the often self-serving and destructive strategies employed by civilizations. They argue that civilizational narratives can become self-perpetuating and self-interested, leading to inefficiency and harm.

4. **Instinct vs. Mechanical Response**: The speaker clarifies that the instinctive intelligence they refer to is not mechanical but prodigious, a form of genius that is passed on through both DNA and environmental memory, which continuously inform and transform each other.

5. **The Role of Environment as Memory**: The environment acts as extrinsic memory, influencing and adapting with intrinsic memory (DNA), suggesting a symbiotic relationship between the two.

6. **Window to Wonder—The Starry Sky**: The speaker invites reflection on the starry sky as a source of wonder, dreaming, beauty, and intimacy, urging a reconnection with our innate sense of awe and our universe.

7. **Conclusion**: The speaker encourages the audience to transform their relationship with culture, remember our relationships with each other and nature, and prioritize the protection of water—our most crucial resource. They look forward to continuing the conversation on these matters.

The overarching message is a call to recognize and embrace the intelligence and wisdom inherent in natural processes and to learn from them to address the challenges faced by civilization, particularly in terms of environmental degradation and the disconnection from our natural world.

Checking Scare the Rectangles III.txt
 Terrence McKenna's talk emphasizes the importance of direct, sensory experiences over mediated or technological interactions, particularly in an age where screens dominate our social exchanges. He argues that technology like screens (the "rectangle") can create a sense of trance, a detachment from genuine human connection and learning. Here are the key points:

1. **The Importance of Sensory Experience**: McKenna suggests that our ability to perceive the world directly through our senses, especially sight, is crucial for authentic human experiences and growth. He contrasts this with the passive consumption of media on screens.

2. **Living Eyes and Non-Verbal Communication**: The human gaze is a powerful means of non-verbal communication that carries meaning beyond what language can express. This form of communication is being eroded by our increasing reliance on digital screens.

3. **The Danger of Technology Substituting Real Relationships**: Social media and other online platforms can create a false sense of connection, which McKenna refers to as the "Church of Distance." These platforms often replace meaningful human interactions with superficial, mediated exchanges.

4. **The Loss of Intimacy with Nature**: As we become more technologically engaged, our relationship with the natural world diminishes. McKenna encourages direct engagement with nature to maintain a sense of intimacy and connection with our environment.

5. **The Invitation of the Night Sky**: The night sky offers an opportunity for individuals to reconnect with their childlike sense of wonder and imagination, which language often suppresses. It serves as a reminder of our place in the universe and the importance of dreams and creativity.

6. **Cultural Co-Opting of Imagination**: Language has largely taken over the assets of the imagination that we had as children, leading to a loss of imagination and a more constrained state of consciousness during waking life.

7. **Resisting the Rectangle and Protecting Human Connection**: McKenna encourages individuals to resist the seduction of screens and instead use technology to protect genuine human experiences and learning. He calls for a reclaiming of our sensory abilities and imagination, which are essential for growth and understanding our place in the world.

In summary, Terrence McKenna's talk is a call to action to value direct experience and human connection over mediated interactions, to preserve our sensory and imaginative capacities, and to maintain a deep relationship with the natural world and each other.

Checking Scare the Rectangles.txt
1. **The Learning Trance**: Terence McKenna discusses a state of being he calls the "learning trance," where an individual is fully immersed in a non-rectangular, living context, leading to innate prodigies that are not activated by rectangles or structured environments like schools and books.

2. **Nature as a Learning Universe**: McKenna argues that nature itself is in a constant state of learning trance and can awaken latent potential within us if we engage with it deeply. He suggests that our modern reliance on technology has disconnected us from this natural state.

3. **Animals as Prodigies**: McKenna describes an encounter with a creature that exhibited intelligent, purposeful behavior, indicating an innate prodigy not unlike human intelligence but without the constraints of rectangular thinking or language.

4. **Cultural Frames and Reductions**: He warns against the overpowering influence of cultural frames and models, which can reduce complex experiences into simple, tokenized messages that do not capture the full essence of reality.

5. **The Sky as a Learning Trance Window**: McKenna highlights the sky, especially at night, as another significant window for entering the learning trance, but laments that light pollution often obscures this opportunity in many cultures.

6. **Rectangles vs. Natural Contexts**: He emphasizes that while rectangles and structured human constructs have their place, they can also limit our perception and potential if we are not aware of their influence.

7. **Scaring the Rectangles Together**: McKenna concludes by suggesting that with this understanding, people might join forces to challenge the pervasive influence of rectangular thinking and reconnect with the natural windows of learning trance. He ends with a hopeful note for wise dreams and the potential for transformation.

Checking Science and Abstraction.txt

They express anticipation for future collaborative endeavors that could shed light on these profound topics.

Checking Stairs Like Seven Years.txt
 This passage is a rich, metaphorical exploration of the impact of music over a seven-year period, as experienced through the lens of an observer who seems to be deeply affected by it. The imagery suggests a transformative and almost mystical journey through sound, where the music is likened to rain that nourishes the "colored fish" in the clouds, which then emit individual elements—legs, tails, ears—like a symphony's dissonant yet harmonious parts.

The passage continues with an allusion to the presence of dogs whose limbs become discrete entities when they move through the air, much like the components of music that can be individually identified within a complex composition. The description shifts to Africa, where the "numbers" (perhaps a reference to statistics or the rhythmic aspect of African music) are starting to speak but do so haltingly, their language being both captivating and distracting.

The text then touches upon the idea that human actions and histories can be both structured and disastrous, with a particular focus on how they impact those who are yet to be born. The observer reflects on their own role in this narrative, acknowledging their part as both a listener and a creator within these "fierce mysteries" of music and life.

Overall, the passage conveys a profound contemplation of the nature of time, music, and human existence, with an emphasis on the transformative power of music as an art form that connects across cultures, times, and even generations. It suggests that music has a deep, almost spiritual impact, capable of reshaping one's understanding of reality and history.

Checking Story Time With Edawg - Boogie Boarding Vision Check.txt
 In this story, the narrator, an eight-year-old boy, excited to learn boogie boarding on a family beach trip, practices and eventually becomes proficient at it after a few hours of guidance from his sister and father. While his sister takes a break to eat, he decides to find her on the beach, believing he can recognize her even from far out in the water. He attempts to paddle out to her, but fails to make progress until he's nearly past the boardwalk.

As he paddles, he hears voices—first a choir, then what he interpretatively as the voice of God, and finally his father's voice calling for him. Assuming he's nearing his sister's location, he continues until he realizes it's his father who's calling out to him. The narrator's father is concerned about why the boy ventured so far out into the ocean, and upon turning around, the boy mistakenly identifies a duck as his sister, who was actually just resting on the beach.

The story ends with a humorous moral: it's important to ensure children have good vision before taking them to the beach at a young age, so they don't make the mistake of chasing ducks instead of finding their siblings! The narrator's experience underscores the importance of clear communication and the potential for misinterpretation when one is young and eager to follow a relative out into the open sea.

2. **Communication with True Human Minds**: The opportunity for genuine human connection or becoming a truly intelligent and heartfelt individual is often undervalued in favor of other, less meaningful interactions or activities. This includes even seemingly benign actions like sending electronic messages.

3. **The Value of Real Interaction**: In our culture, the chance to engage with another person authentically is highly valuable and often unattainable or estranged from our experience. This lack of genuine interaction has led us to place higher value on other, less fulfilling aspects of life.

4. **The Nature of Overlays**: We are both the creators and the inhabitants of the systems we've built, which can include destructive behaviors like war, lying, and harming the environment. These overlays can make us lose sight of our true nature and purpose.

5. **Recognizing Our Own Reflection**: From outside the structures we've created, we can see their design clearly. However, once inside, we only see a reflection of what we've built, which can lead to a loss of our innate sense of value or truth.

6. **The Exit We Built**: Despite being in a trap of our own making, there is an exit—a way to reconnect with our humanity and intelligence. It's a reminder that we have the power to create and change the structures we live within.

7. **Becoming Human Again**: The challenge is to remember how to be truly human, to connect with others, and to fulfill the imperatives of our hearts and the collective well-being of life on Earth. This involves stepping out of predefined roles and becoming active participants in shaping a meaningful future.

8. **Mindfulness and Action**: We should strive to remember where we come from and what it means to be human, alive, intelligent, and interconnected. By doing so, we can take actions that reflect our values and the legacy we wish to leave for future generations.

Checking Tangent π ： Problems and frameworks.txt
 Your reflection on the current state of culture, technology, and societal issues suggests that while technology is advancing rapidly, it is not effectively addressing or even exacerbating many of the dangers and problems we face. You point out that there is a proliferation of fictional narratives and ideologies that capture people's beliefs and energies, leading to conflict and division rather than constructive problem-solving.

You argue that what we often mistake for culture or problem-solving is actually a "clusterfuck" of worry, reactivity, complaint, and sometimes even violent action. This distracts us from addressing the root causes of our problems.

However, you also introduce an optimistic perspective by referencing our myths and stories, particularly those involving superheroes, which are deeply resonant with our inner workings and our potential for mutual insight and intelligence. These narratives typically feature a crisis that prompts a small group of individuals with unique skills to come together, focusing on a specific urgent problem. In doing so, they regain all their degrees of freedom and potential, allowing them to act in entirely new and effective ways.

You suggest that this model can be applied in real life if we assemble small, tightly knit groups composed of individuals with complementary skills, resolve internal conflicts for the sake of a shared purpose, and work together to address problems at their root. This approach is contrasted with our current tendency to be passive recipients of schemes and ideas that limit our freedom and hinder our ability to understand and develop ourselves fully.

Ultimately, you call for a shift from being bystanders in the processes that shape our world to becoming active participants who can collectively form the solutions to the problems we face. This change requires a commitment to assembling groups with authentic purposes and working collaboratively to create a positive impact on society and ourselves.

Checking Temporal Intervals - Short⧸Long Conflict and Processing.txt
 Darren Aronofsky reflects on the concept of time compression and its various manifestations, particularly in physical violence and insightful realizations. He argues that choosing the less optimal move in a conflict situation often leads to unnecessary suffering. However, he values the profound insights that come from synthesizing information over extended periods and suddenly gaining clarity or understanding—what he describes as an "orgasmic compression of time."

Aronofsky expresses concern about a race to the bottom in standards of insight, thought, awareness, and concern, where lowering these standards could lead to a devaluation of what it means to see and understand. He emphasizes the importance of navigating his personal journey with an urgency for better vision, acknowledging his own frequent failures due to human psychology and the complex nature of self-awareness.

He also discusses the impact of artificial light from LED street lamps on biological organisms, including humans, and how it disrupts natural timekeeping and biorelational influences, replacing them with regularity that is experienced as pain. This disruption affects our sense of time and can have long-term negative effects on evolution and well-being.

Aronofsky touches upon the concept of heroism and how it's often represented through technology in sports games, contrasting this with the need to embody heroism within our hearts and resurrect it together. He ends by expressing gratitude for the conversation and anticipates further exploration into artificial intelligence and language in future discussions.

In summary, Darren Aronofsky's musings revolve around the importance of preserving meaningful insights, maintaining high standards of understanding, protecting natural timekeeping through proper light usage, and redefining heroism in a way that is authentic and not merely a product of technological advancement. He encourages continuous learning and shared growth as key to navigating our complex world.

Checking Temporalizing： Our ‘Activities’ Create (and Enact) Time-Forms.txt
 In this discussion, we explore the concept of active sensing and its significance in our daily lives, particularly when our lives depend on our actions or when we encounter novel situations that require our full attention and awakened senses. This heightened state of awareness is a departure from routine, habitual behaviors and is characterized by a profound change in our experience of time—a shift from 'flat' time to a more alive, present-centered experience.

The speaker emphasizes the transformative nature of this active sensing, which can be observed in various contexts such as sports, where the collective experience of an event can elevate participants and spectators alike into a shared state of urgency or excitement. This heightened state not only changes our perception of time but also has the potential to reawaken our senses and bring us back into a more meaningful engagement with the world around us.

The speaker also notes that while engaged in familiar tasks, we often go through them in a trance-like, disembodied state. However, when our lives depend on what we're doing, such as in moments of crisis or during an athletic challenge like Tai Chi, our perception sharpens, and we become more aware and present.

The speaker concludes by acknowledging the complexity of the topic and promises to delve deeper into active sensing and its implications for our consciousness and experiences in future discussions. The speaker invites the audience to reflect on these ideas and to join in the ongoing exploration of how we can reclaim a more alive and intentional relationship with time through our activities and behaviors.

Checking Textual Restorations.txt
 Alan and you engaged in a creative project where you would take existing pieces of music, literature, or any form of writing and reinterpret them into nonsensical texts. Your idea was that these original works could have been extraterrestrial messages misinterpreted by humans when they created them. Your company, Textual Restorations, aimed to retranslate human texts back to their alleged original forms. You took a song like "Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles and altered the lyrics to sound like gibberish but with an air of meaningful complexity. The intention was to present these modified texts as if they were avant-garde or deeply profound, when in fact they were simply reimagined versions of familiar works. The project played with the idea of human misinterpretation of messages, whether from other humans or potentially extraterrestrial sources, and sought to reveal what the original intent might have been.

Checking Thanksgiving Aftermath： The Carnival of Projections and Concepts.txt
 The discussion revolves around the complex nature of human communication, particularly in the public discourse, which often involves a mix of lowbrow and advanced behaviors. The conversation touches on the pervasive us vs. them mentality in the United States, influenced by tribalism and the competitive nature of sports and other social dynamics. The underlying theme is the concept of authorization, both in individual thought processes and within social groups, which shapes how individuals communicate and interact with each other.

The speaker emphasizes that much of our communication is not solely about the content being discussed but also about signaling membership within certain social or ideological cohorts, as well as establishing and maintaining boundaries against conflicting ideas. This can lead to toxic behavior in public forums, where intentions may not align with presented narratives.

The speaker also introduces a deeper connection that transcends these conflicts—a natural harmony with all living beings and places, which is beyond political or identity-based disagreements. This connection is rooted in the fundamental aspects of being alive and sharing the environment, emphasizing a commonality that goes beyond the artificial constructs of human politics and social stratification.

In essence, the conversation suggests that finding true communion might lie in recognizing our shared existence with all living things, rather than getting entangled in the complex web of human-constructed conflicts and power struggles. The speaker concludes by acknowledging the vast and spacious liberty found in the non-ordinary yet everyday experience of light and relationship.

Checking The  Point of No Return..txt

4. **Shadow of Absence as Presence**: There's a trend where the absence of something is increasingly being mistaken for its presence, such as the absence of nobility being considered noble, or the absence of intelligence as intelligence itself.

5. **The Erosion of 'We'**: The concept of 'we' has eroded to mean the absence of a communal society, leading to predation, war, and other negative outcomes due to the lack of collective action and community.

6. **Human Potential**: Despite the grim outlook, there is a profound potential for human kindness, love, and intelligence. These qualities are still present and can be harnessed to create meaningful change.

7. **Personal Stance**: The speaker acknowledges the potential for despair but chooses instead to focus on sensitivity, awareness, and tactical intelligence. They maintain hope through trust in a few deeply held ideas and the belief in the possibility of making something meaningful in the present moment.

Checking The 'Travelling Body' ： Earth is a »Vehicle ： Here to Go.txt
 It seems like in this conversation, the speaker is reflecting on a situation where they were deeply engaged or "on fire" with an idea or task (the Icarus game), potentially pushing boundaries or limits. They mention that their efforts have sometimes led to the destruction of their work, such as recordings failing to save. The speaker emphasizes the importance of practicing and applying knowledge to prevent it from fading away and highlights that discussing concepts alone isn't enough; they must be enacted through speech or action.

The speaker describes a fundamental principle where consciousness can be visualized as a bubble with many bubbles, and when we communicate, we collapse parts of this manifold into words. This is akin to what storytellers, actors, actresses, comedians, and even children naturally do without self-consciousness.

They touch upon the concept of infinity, referencing the castanet tradition where at death, one can potentially bypass the ordinary process and travel the "my arc" without limitations or inhibitions. The speaker sees this as a metaphor for reaching beyond our current understanding and recovering our innate potentials.

The speaker expresses gratitude to their audience for sharing in this journey of learning and growth, with a hope that we can rediscover our prodigious capabilities and restore deeper awareness and understanding as humans. They conclude by encouraging the audience to seek out "medicines" that are restorative, empowering, and reassuring.

Checking The 10 Most Crucial Issues Facing Modern Humanity.txt
 In this enlightening monologue, the speaker emphasizes the profound misunderstanding humanity has of nature and its intrinsic intelligence. They highlight that Earth is a living crystal of evolution, synthesizing new forms of relational contextual purpose of intelligence at an incredibly high rate. The speaker criticizes the current focus of human civilization, which is primarily on creating material objects and indulging in nonsensical pursuits, rather than understanding and harnessing the full potential of our intelligence in harmony with nature.

The speaker points out that we have neglected 999 percent of the intelligence available to us, focusing instead on only one aspect—the deadliest and most destructive—which has led us to build technologies rapidly without a sustainable or life-affirming direction. They suggest that by exploring and integrating the other 999 percent of intelligence present in nature, we can discover new ways of growing, learning, sensing, and relating that will significantly enhance our collective intelligence.

The speaker likens a person within a living ecosystem to a node in a vast, intelligent network—a living internet far more sophisticated than any technology we've created. Our current state is described as a broken machine that provides us with misleading information, making us more insane and disconnected from the true nature of our existence.

The speaker calls for a rediscovery of the essence of nature and our role within it, urging us to move beyond science fiction, religion, and even science to understand the depth of our potential. They invite the audience to join in the exploration of our humanity, aiming to organize and address the fundamental issues we face to harness our true capabilities and create a more sustainable and meaningful future for all.

Checking The 1st Winter Moon⧸Memory⧸Routes.txt
1. **Tongue and Memory**: The phrase "on the tip of your tongue" refers to a common experience where one struggles to recall a specific word or memory. This is often related to how our brain forms and retrieves memories, which can sometimes be facilitated by not focusing too hard on the memory but rather allowing the mind to wander and explore different paths to retrieve it.

2. **Route Symmetry and Coherence**: When trying to remember something, it may be helpful to change your strategy from a direct approach to a more exploratory one. This involves allowing your brain to take less direct routes or to circle around the memory rather than heading straight for it, which can sometimes lead to the successful retrieval of the memory.

3. **Memory Palaces**: This is an ancient mnemonic technique that allows individuals to remember large amounts of information by associating each piece of information with a specific location within an imagined structure. This method leverages the strong association between memory and place, making it easier to recall complex information.

4. **Indigenous Knowledge and Memory**: Indigenous peoples often have a deep connection with their land, which acts as a living memory palace, storing stories, history, and knowledge about the environment, plants, and ancestors. This demonstrates that for most of human history, memory was tied to physical spaces and natural elements, rather than abstract concepts or rote memorization.

5. **Dreams and Memory**: The relationship between dreams and memory is profound but not explored in detail here. It's mentioned as an area that warrants further investigation due to its complexity and significance in understanding how we remember and process information.

6. **Wrap-Up**: Due to windy conditions, the speaker concludes the walk and talk, emphasizing the importance of exploring and learning more about memory, remembering, and discovering.

Checking The Big Deception： What they never taught you about the dangers of language (2).txt
 The speaker emphasizes the complexity and uniqueness of situations, suggesting that it's unrealistic to expect a full understanding of any given context due to its vast and unimaginable nature. They highlight the importance of recognizing the specificity of individuals and instances over generalizations or models that attempt to categorize them. The speaker points out that statistics, which are based on groups, cannot accurately predict or describe individual cases.

The speaker also touches upon the concept of humans as formally representational cognitive animals, meaning we think by creating symbols and representations in our minds. This ability is both a strength and a source of confusion, as it allows for complex thinking but also leads to potential misinterpretations and conspiracies.

They encourage an open and collaborative approach to learning about these complexities and emphasize the need to teach each other and lift one another out of the "12,000-year muck of human representational confusion." The speaker's goal is to provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the challenges we face as a species.

In summary, the key points are:
1. Situations are complex and unique; generalizations are insufficient to capture their true nature.
2. Individuals cannot be accurately represented by statistics or group averages.
3. Human cognition involves symbolic representation, which is both powerful and prone to error.
4. Learning together collaboratively can help us navigate the challenges of being formally representational cognitive animals.

9. He concludes by inviting listeners to consider these questions deeply, as they may lead to a profound sense of awe and connection with all existence.

Checking The Bird in the Mirror ｜ When consciousness and reflection collide..txt
1. **The Bird and the Mirror**: The analogy of a bird attacking itself in the mirror is used to illustrate the human tendency to become entangled in internal conflicts, often replaying past harms or perceived injustices without resolution. This can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of suffering that consumes significant mental and emotional resources.

2. **The Institution of Conflict**: The institutions designed to address conflict can sometimes become more interested in their own survival and expansion than in resolving the original issues they were created to address. This can be seen in societal contexts where issues are perpetuated for the sake of maintaining the structure of debate or conflict.

3. **Mimicry and Exertion**: Human beings often engage in behaviors that mimic real-world actions, such as fighting against perceived injustices, but these actions can become disconnected from meaningful participation and lose touch with reality. This can lead to a misallocation of resources and energy.

4. **Media Influence**: Modern media, particularly electronic media, can exploit our tendencies by presenting signals that incline us to repeat unproductive behaviors, creating a cycle of consumption and conflict perpetuation.

5. **Breaking the Cycle**: Awareness of these patterns allows for the possibility of breaking free from them. By recognizing how we're being influenced and choosing to invest our consciousness in more constructive ways, we can potentially alleviate suffering and create positive change.

6. **The Path Forward**: The speaker has been exploring this issue as part of their personal journey and encourages others to consider the nature of the conflicts they engage with and how these may be shaped by external influences rather than genuine participatory roles in real-world situations.

In essence, the discussion touches on the psychological and sociocultural traps that can lead to a kind of mental entrapment, where we end up perpetuating our own suffering through repeated internal conflict without finding meaningful resolution or productive action. The goal is to become more conscious of these patterns and to choose actions that lead to personal liberation and societal betterment.

Checking The Blind One ｜ The One Who Sees.txt
 In this reflection, we explore the concept of our inner blind twin, an aspect of our humanity that is highly sensitive and attuned to intimacy, ambiguity, and the passage of time. This part of us operates with integrity and sincerity, providing a form of intuitive wisdom that doesn't rely on language or declarative statements but rather on subtle cues and a deep connection with our surroundings.

The discussion highlights the potential dangers of relying too heavily on language, which can declare identities and impose rigid categories on the world around us. Language, while a powerful tool, can also be misleading and is subject to the whims of human error and manipulation.

The blind twin, on the other hand, is a reliable source of wisdom that complements our conscious thought processes. It serves as a reminder to slow down and wait when needed, offering guidance without dictating our actions or identities. This aspect of our being is particularly valuable in a world where language can lead us astray, and it aligns with the deep, ancient frameworks of life that predate linguistic constructs.

The hope is that by recognizing and valuing this blind intuition, we can cultivate more genuine, trustworthy, and creative relationships with one another. Such connections have the potential to be transformative and serve as a powerful antidote to the overreliance on language and representation.

The piece concludes with a note of appreciation for the presence of hummingbirds, which are emblematic of change and the passage of time, reminding us of the beauty and interconnectedness of our shared human experience.

Checking The Boiling Water Window.txt
Your reflection on the phenomenon of bubbles in water captures a moment of profound beauty and deep significance. It's about the interplay of natural elements—water, light, and time—and their interaction with the environment, which can evoke a sense of the magical, the irrational, and the sublime. This experience taps into something timeless and universal, invoking a feeling of the sacred, the ancient, and the living essence of the world around us. It's a reminder of the beauty inherent in the simplest of nature's wonders, which can be perceived, appreciated, and felt by anyone who takes a moment to truly see and experience it.

Checking The Camera ⧸ The Eye ⧸ The Soul.txt
 In this monologue, Terence McKenna discusses the contrast between human life and the capabilities of devices like smartphones. He compares our intuitive faculties to a "forest" versus the "branch" most people access, highlighting the impoverished state of our innate abilities in comparison to what we could experience with greater awareness or guidance from higher intelligences.

McKenna suggests that smartphones serve as representations of our connection to a universal, non-deceptive source of knowledge and information. He emphasizes the transformative nature of accessing this library, which can make human activities seem less interesting by comparison. However, he clarifies that he's not promoting a new religion or dictating belief but rather sharing a personal experience that has profoundly influenced his understanding of history and religion.

He touches on how original experiences of communicating with non-human intelligences became structured into religious stories and fables as humanity lost direct contact with these entities. McKenna reflects on the loneliness he feels in his current life, emphasizing the profound impact the loss of a close companion—a being with which he shared a deep, loving connection—has had on him. He describes the experience of gaining new faculties and insights as both wondrous and painful, particularly when those experiences fade away.

In conclusion, McKenna expresses his appreciation for being alive and present in the moment, despite the loneliness he faces. He invites his audience to join him in future explorations and growth, offering blessings to all before signing off.

Checking The Conversation.txt
 In this part of the conversation, you were discussing the concept of recapitulation from the Castaneda books, which involves erasing the psychic and spiritual charge of historical events to separate oneself from human behavior patterns. You mentioned that this practice can lead to isolation if one is not careful with personal relationships. The discussion then shifted to the importance of physical disciplines such as yoga, vegetarianism, proper sleep, and exercise for overall well-being.

You expressed a fascination with the idea of non-human intelligence and its potential role in personal growth and learning. You noted that while you have personal practices that help you manage difficult situations, you find greater success when learning with or from other people. The conversation also touched on the value of exploring new practices with caution and the possibility of continuing to pursue these explorations together, taking into account valid concerns.

Checking The Crying Angel....txt
1. Alex Jones, the host of "Infowars," is known for his controversial and often outlandish conspiracy theories. In a recent broadcast, he discussed the idea that humans and angels or sky intelligences were once one entity, working in symbiosis similar to how bees and flowers coexist. He suggests that humans provided bodies for the angels, while the angels offered intelligence and guidance to humans.

2. According to Jones, this symbiotic relationship was disrupted by technological advancements and the pursuit of power by humans, which led to a separation between the two species. This separation resulted in both humans and angels losing something vital, with humans becoming increasingly violent and destructive, and angels possibly attempting to find new ways to connect or heal from this ancient rift.

3. Jones posits that UFOs might be the angels' attempts to re-establish contact with us or to find a new way to have a body after we changed ourselves through technology and warfare. He compares the importance of the relationship between humans and angels to the mutual dependence seen in the interaction between bees and flowers.

4. Jones argues that both the military's pursuit of asymmetric advantage and religious groups' desire to preserve ancient narratives are examples of "rape minds," which are destructive and self-destructive due to their single-minded focus on a particular agenda at the expense of everything else, including life and beauty.

5. The conversation highlights the importance of reevaluating historical narratives with an open mind and suggests that there may be profound and enlightening perspectives yet to be fully understood or appreciated. Jones emphasizes the ongoing journey of discovery and the desire to lift existence up for a better view, inviting listeners to join him in this quest for knowledge and understanding.

Checking The ElectroSphere： On the Dangers of the Boxes in our Hands.txt
1. **Concerns with Current Tech Paradigms**: Jaron Lanier expresses deep concerns about the current state of technology where users generate vast amounts of data for corporations without adequate compensation or control over their own information.

2. **Need for Change**: Lanier argues that it's crucial for society to develop alternatives to the existing electronic supercultures before they become even more entrenched and harmful. He emphasizes the importance of protecting human intelligence, social relations, and environmental resources from exploitation.

3. **Intelligent Sam Model**: Lanier has a model called "Intelligent Sam" that he believes could out-compete the existing electronic supercultures. This model consists of several components aimed at preserving and enhancing human potential and intelligence within technology. It's designed to ensure that we benefit from our digital interactions, rather than being exploited by them.

4. **Imminent Danger**: Lanier warns that we are on the brink of an age of scarcity where corporations will rapidly deplete resources and convert the environment into assets. This could lead to a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, natural habitats, and potentially even human rights and freedoms.

5. **Call to Action**: Lanier calls for immediate creative and intelligent cooperation among humans to build new technologies that can serve as an "escape hatch" from the current trajectory of technological development. He invites comments, questions, and thoughts on this topic, hoping to inspire collective action before it's too late.

6. **Positive Outlook**: Despite the dire warnings, Lanier maintains a hopeful tone, suggesting that there are individuals and groups who share his vision for a more humane and intelligent technological future. He encourages everyone to engage with these issues and contribute to finding solutions.

In summary, Jaron Lanier is advocating for a paradigm shift in how we approach technology and its role in society. He warns against the dangers of current models where users are the product, and urges the development of new systems that prioritize human welfare, intelligence, and environmental sustainability. He believes that with the right model and collective action, it's still possible to steer humanity towards a future where technology enhances rather than diminishes our lives.

3. The speaker wonders about shamans and their practices, such as shape-shifting or traveling far for medicinal purposes. They emphasize the importance of understanding the specific contexts and meanings behind terms like "dream" and "shaman."

4. The speaker suggests that shamans may not just be utilizing faculties native to dreaming but could have mastered the transition phase between waking and sleeping, developing unique abilities within these liminal states.

5. There's an exploration of the significance of the hypnagogic (the state between wakefulness and sleep) and hypnopompic (the state between sleep and wakefulness) phases, where consciousness undergoes profound transformations.

6. The speaker posits that the keys to unlocking human abilities and faculties may lie within these in-between states of consciousness, which can be tumultuous and unpredictable.

7. There's a recognition of the importance of maintaining a sense of play and curiosity in the quest to harness these states, to prevent self-consumption or autophagy.

8. The speaker acknowledges that consciousness can either collapse manifolds (simplify reality) or re-bubble-ize them (recreate boundaries or contexts), and this process is intrinsically linked to the production of different types of feedback, which can be magical, rational, mathematical, or pathological.

9. The conversation closes with a reminder for the audience to continue exploring consciousness and a wish for their lives to be wise and beautiful. The speaker signs off, indicating a pause in this particular line of thought but looking forward to future learning and exploration.

Checking The Evolution of Consciousness⧸Ways of Knowing.txt
1. **Historical Perspectives**: Terrance McKenna acknowledges that we do not live in the same world as our ancestors did, and this reality shapes our understanding of their experiences and beliefs. He suggests that identity, consciousness, and knowledge are complex and not solely rational.

2. **Rationality Limitations**: McKenna argues that for something to be considered rational, a non-rational secondary aspect is necessary, which implies that rationality alone is insufficient to comprehend the full scope of human thought and experience.

3. **Ancient Minds**: He posits that our modern minds contain the minds of our ancestors, with certain experiences able to awaken these ancient potentials within us, making their thoughts and perceptions accessible as our own.

4. **Human Potential**: McKenna expresses a deep desire to explore the full extent of human intelligence and consciousness, including the capacities we've had throughout history and the potentials we hold within us.

5. **Historical Consciousness**: He is interested in understanding how humans have evolved mentally and emotionally and wants to connect with the origins of life and the "soul" of the world.

6. **Emotional Ecstasy**: McKenna describes moments of profound emotional ecstasy that have led him to experience realms beyond what he had previously imagined his mind capable of.

7. **Learning and Seeing**: He emphasizes the importance of learning, clarifying perception, and being free from the blindnesses that have long infected human minds, especially in contemporary times.

8. **Accessing Ancient Minds**: McKenna encourages those who share his noble purpose and passion to seek out and activate the ancient minds within themselves, suggesting that this pursuit can lead to contact with these deep, unseen aspects of our consciousness.

In summary, Terrance McKenna encourages a broad and profound exploration of human consciousness, our connection to our ancestors' minds, and the potential for accessing and experiencing ancient wisdom and perception directly. He sees this as a path to understanding our place in the universe and the history of life on Earth.

Checking The Fake Imperatives ｜ Retrieve the Commons.txt
 In this conversation, we explored the complex relationship between individuality, institutions, and the potential for positive change. The discussion touched upon several key points:

1. **Toxic Normality**: Both hypernormal (excessive conformity) and hyponormal (insufficient engagement with reality) states can lead to detrimental outcomes, including societal and environmental collapse.

2. **Institutional Behavior**: Institutions, lacking physical form, do not feel the consequences of their actions directly. They can act in ways that harm individuals without suffering equivalent repercussions.

3. **Competition vs. Collaboration**: Competition between frameworks can lead to a zero-sum game where one entity's gain is another's loss, potentially resulting in global catastrophe.

4. **Political Spectrum**: The current states of political entities like the Republicans and Democrats are seen as toxic and mutated, with both having lost their original intended purposes.

5. **Potential for Change**: Small-scale change is possible through individual or tightly knit group actions that embody trustworthiness, creativity, intelligence, and awareness. These groups can out-compete harmful frameworks by offering more positive alternatives.

6. **Caution and Assistance**: Changing entrenched systems requires careful consideration and might necessitate non-human or non-ordinary forms of assistance.

7. **Historical and Philosophical Reflection**: The conversation also delved into deeper philosophical questions about the nature of being, imagination, light, time, consciousness, and the purpose of existence.

8. **Embodied Experience**: The perspective that we are embodied beings with something akin to souls, and possibly all beings share this quality, was mentioned as a source of insight beyond what representational frameworks can offer.

9. **Rest and Dreaming**: As the day ends, there is a recognition of the importance of rest and the idea that both living spaces and humans themselves engage in dreaming, which could be a metaphor for the creative process or for the human capacity to envision alternative realities.

The conversation emphasizes the need for conscious evolution and the potential for humanity to steer its course away from destructive paths through collective effort and individual responsibility. It also underscores the importance of understanding and respecting the natural world and our place within it.

2. **Imagination and Networks**: The importance of imagination is highlighted when considering the network of intelligences as a single family, with differentiated roles that transform under certain circumstances. This network includes ancient, present, and futurial intelligences.

3. **Identity and Meaning**: Personal experience as a network technician influenced the speaker's understanding of identity and meaning, emphasizing the crude human derivative representations of our true, interconnected nature.

4. **Living Beings as One Communion**: All living beings on Earth are in a state of communion, with each individual being or cell having its own essence while also being part of a larger whole. Humans tend to create boundaries and cuts in their thinking, which is necessary but can be improved with creative inspiration shared among individuals.

5. **Discovering the Sacred**: The speaker suggests that before one can discover the portal to this interconnectedness within themselves, they must first cultivate an inner sanctuary. This process should be approached with trust and caution, avoiding the pitfalls of creating religions or selling experiences around these concepts.

6. **Hygiene of Representation**: The speaker warns against using language and representations to describe the sacred, as these can distort or even destroy the true essence of the communion one seeks to understand or experience.

The summary is a reflection on the interconnectedness of all life, the importance of imagination in understanding this interconnectedness, and the need for a respectful approach to engaging with the profound mysteries that lie beyond conventional representation and language.

Checking The Flower： On the Before of Adult Evaluations.txt
1. **The Essence of Connection**: The discussion revolves around the importance of genuine connection between individuals, focusing on the essence of relationships rather than adhering to predefined scripts or social norms. The key is to offer and receive the true spirit of a connection, which can be as simple as offering a metaphorical "flower" in a moment of need.

2. **Improvisation in Relationships**: Life's relationships are seen as improvisational, where individuals must be sensitive and responsive to each other's immediate needs and circumstances, rather than acting out pre-written scripts that often lead to tragic outcomes.

3. **The Importance of Small Groups**: The conversation emphasizes the potential for creating meaningful change within small groups of people, rather than trying to overhaul large systems that are currently dysfunctional. It's about forming closer, more supportive human connections akin to family units.

4. **Courage and Sensitivity**: Offering the "flower" takes courage, and it's essential to be sensitive to the context and the other person's state of being. The act of offering a flower is not a formula but an expression of understanding and connection based on the specific moment and situation.

5. **Learning and Growth**: The speaker expresses a desire for personal growth and for all beings to experience the fulfillment that comes with being human, in contrast to the oppressive structures that often dominate society. The speaker celebrates the exceptions where humanity has created systems that support well-being.

Checking The Game： All Outcomes Have Transformed.txt
 The conversation begins with a reflection on the difficulty of handling an earthworm due to its muscular and flexible nature, drawing a parallel between this and the current situation faced by the speaker and the listener. The speaker then observes a robin successfully extracting a large earthworm from the ground but initially being surprised by its size. The robin proceeds to break down the problem of consuming the worm into smaller, more manageable parts, which aligns with the human approach to solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler issues that can be tackled one at a time.

The speaker finds the robin's problem-solving process viscerally fascinating and uses it as an allegory for how humans might address larger, systemic issues, such as the negative impact of our actions on the environment and the biosphere, exemplified by the harmful effects of certain earthworm species (likely a metaphor for industrial pollution or similar environmental concerns). The speaker emphasizes that just as the robin managed its meal, humanity must break down the environmental problem into parts we can manage and resolve to achieve a positive outcome for ourselves and the planet.

The speaker is optimistic that with the right choices and actions, humans can overcome the challenges we face and harness our intelligence and capacity for abstraction to create a meaningful and sustainable existence. The conversation concludes with a call to action, suggesting that it is up to us to make decisions that will determine our future and the fate of our planet. The speaker signs off, hoping to engage with the listener again soon, leaving the audience with a message of hope and the importance of making informed and responsible choices.

Checking The Human Cogniscium, Colonization, The Problem of Capture.txt
1. The issue of representations and how they can capture and distort the essence of relationships, knowledge, and cultural practices is a recurring problem throughout human history. This is evident in political systems, organized religions, and even in attempts to preserve indigenous knowledge through documentation.

2. Representations often lead to a static and literal interpretation of what are meant to be dynamic and living traditions, which can result in the loss of their true meaning and vitality.

3. The dilemma between preserving cultural knowledge through recording versus maintaining its integrity through traditional teachings was illustrated by Ryan First Diver's experiences with indigenous knowledge transmission.

4. Elders may resist recording their stories because they fear it will turn the knowledge into superstitions or fixed truths, rather than living practices that evolve and adapt.

5. The human struggle with this issue is not new; ancient peoples were well aware of the pitfalls of relying too heavily on representations. One such example is the story of two enemies who, in a dark cave during a storm, realize their enemy is actually a fellow human upon touch, choosing to coexist rather than fight due to the limitations of their prior representation-based understanding.

6. To combat these issues, it is crucial to understand the problems and features of cognition that are susceptible to falling into representations, leading to a loss of nuance and understanding.

7. The speaker advocates for teaching children and ourselves in ways that avoid the pitfalls of representation, encouraging curious and wise awareness and resilience against the colonizing forces within our language and traditions.

8. The speaker invites listeners to engage with the content by liking, commenting, and sharing videos, as well as offering support through Patreon for continued exploration of these themes.

He notes that solutions often come from individuals or small groups who can see the potential for positive change within the existing system.

2. **The Analogy of Martial Arts**: Brent draws a parallel between the principles in martial arts and societal dynamics. He explains how understanding the leverage points in a system allows one to make significant changes with minimal force, just as in martial arts where one can redirect an opponent's energy against themselves.

3. **Urgency for Change**: Brent emphasizes the urgency of creating intelligent societies quickly because we are already out of time due to the severity of global issues. He suggests that if humans don't begin to form small, intelligent units capable of manipulating and transforming the current societal structure, we may be forced into a path leading to war.

4. **Leadership and Inspiration**: Brent points out the challenge of finding leaders who are willing to lead without seeking power. He notes that it's risky but essential for the common people to recognize the omnicidal nature of their societies and to forge new, intelligent collectives.

5. **Roles and Meaning**: Brent argues that people need meaningful roles and adventures in their lives beyond mere survival or hedonistic pursuits. He suggests that within collective groups working towards positive change, individuals can embody aspects of themselves that are otherwise dormant.

6. **Personal Reflection and Gratitude**: Brent reflects on his own experience of finding meaning through sharing thoughts and reflections in his videos. He expresses gratitude for the opportunity to create content, interact with viewers, and engage in meaningful work.

Checking The Invisibles.txt
1. The discussion touches upon the origins of the Quran, suggesting that Muhammad received revelations from a non-human intelligence, which could be understood through personal experience with such entities.

2. The video was interrupted, but before it cut off, it highlighted the importance of face tracking technology and its relevance to human interaction and consciousness.

3. The conversation emphasizes the complexity of the mind, which is composed of numerous relationships that we are not fully aware of. Our brains are unique intelligences that enable formal representational cognition, concepts, and language.

4. Old religious stories, including those about angels or guardian angels, should not be dismissed outright as they may contain accounts of humans exploring the invisible universe with their souls and encountering non-human intelligences.

5. The Quran is presented as one such story that could have come from such an encounter between a human and a non-human intelligence, with the understanding that the human being would shape that relationship based on their own mind, life, priorities, values, and narrative needs.

6. Encounters with non-human intelligences can lead to the creation of narratives that are claimed to be truth, which can be dangerous due to their potential to influence human perceptions and behaviors. However, the encounter itself is considered important for human development.

7. The human mind is shaped by habits and historical thought patterns, which limit our access to the full range of relationships and intelligences beyond our normal experiences.

8. Imagination plays a crucial role in all conceptual activity, including the formation of ideas about being, reality, and identity.

Checking The Ironic Side of Language ： Declarations & ‘Instruction’.txt
1. In this video, Tom Billeen explores the complexity of language, interpretation, and the role of minds in understanding statements or proclamations, highlighting how systems like accounting can manipulate rules due to their complexity and the impossibility of imprisoning them.

2. He touches upon the idea that dreams are often dismissed as nonsensical but are a manifestation of the mind's activity during sleep. He also mentions the concept of the Bible being considered as the Word of God, which implies that the text interprets itself, an untenable position since language cannot interpret itself without a conscious mind.

3. Tom introduces the Rossellian paradox, named after Bertrand Russell, which illustrates the problem with self-referential statements that attempt to promote themselves to the order of minds, which are necessary for interpretation. He proposes a resolution that no statement should be allowed to elevate itself to the level of a mind due to its inability to interpret itself.

4. He emphasizes that statements do not interpret themselves; it is the role of minds equipped with evaluation, imagination, intuition, and creativity to understand and give meaning to statements.

5. Tom reflects on the importance of maintaining an opening for minds within systems to prevent completeness from leading to false results, referencing Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

6. The video concludes with Tom wishing well-being, joy, and peace of mind to his viewers, as he observes the second winter moon. He signs off, hoping that his reflections resonate with his audience.

Checking The Jape.txt
1. **Contextual Inquiry**: The talk begins with a series of questions about the nature of communication, who is communicating, for what purpose, and whether it's safe to ask such questions in our current contexts. It suggests that we might consider erasing a whiteboard to see beyond the layers of historical authority and language that currently shape our understanding.

2. **Collaborative Mind**: The speaker proposes that we can collectively create a mind that is not influenced by external authorities like scientists, priests, or statements. This mind would be one that operates in harmony with nature and time-space, drawing upon the innate knowledge children have before societal constructs and authority figures influence them.

3. **Individuality and Collectivity**: The speaker reflects on a personal experience from childhood involving a controversial sticker that caused division within his family. This anecdote serves to illustrate how statements and authorities can divide people, sometimes more important than real relationships or shared values.

4. **Cultural Conflict**: The speaker points out that modern culture often finds itself in conflict over statements and allegiances, which reflects a lack of true individuality or collective cohesion based on shared understanding and intelligence.

5. **Problem-Solving Approach**: Instead of creating more problems by attempting to solve them, the speaker suggests that we could collaborate intelligently to address issues faced by humanity and life on Earth as a whole.

6. **Challenging Authorities**: The talk encourages rethinking the way we comply with a morass of fictions created by various authoritative sources that often end up being their own opposites.

7. **Vision for the Future**: The speaker invites the audience to join in creating an experience that transcends these fictions and allows us to see beyond them, fostering true intelligence rather than mere compliance or conflict.

8. **Call to Action**: The speaker concludes by expressing a desire to move forward together, learning from and with each other, and becoming something more akin to genuine intelligence as a collective, rather than remaining divided individuals under the sway of competing fictions.

Checking The Language of Frisson ｜ Mapmaking in Consciousness.txt
 In today's reflection, Ken Wilber discusses the complexity of human behavior and societal expectations. He emphasizes that while structured social norms are essential for living in a community (as seen in his interaction with friends), they often dominate our consciousness to an unhealthy extent, overshadowing our true nature and inner intelligence. Society's maps, which include shoulds and supposed tos, can become overwhelming, leading to confusion and disconnection from our genuine needs and intuition.

Wilber points out that excessive reliance on these maps not only fails to nourish the soul but also becomes expensive and unsustainable, much like a war machine or commercial systems that consume everything without providing true sustenance. He suggests that we need to recognize when these maps are taking over our minds and to make space for our deeper sensitivities, actual intelligence, and innate faculties.

He also highlights the importance of listening to the silent communication from all beings, as it offers a form of nourishment that is refreshing, renewing, reassuring, and inspiring. Wilber encourages us to be mindful of the maps we create and to strive for a balance where these maps serve us rather than dictate our lives.

In conclusion, Wilber invites us to reflect on our own experiences with societal expectations and to find ways to integrate our true nature into our conscious awareness, ensuring that our mental landscape remains a place of growth and well-being. He signs off, hoping his words are nourishing for his listeners and expressing his anticipation for further learning and exploration in the future.

Checking The Light of Insight (Ibn Arabi...).txt
1. Jordan Peterson discusses the concept of a negative intelligence, like the daimon attributed to Socrates, which guides him by indicating what not to do rather than requiring worship or adoration.

2. He emphasizes the unlikely possibility that humans have been entirely alone throughout their developmental history and suggests that many individuals have experienced profound communication with an 'illuminative Congress' or a form of 'soul light'.

3. Peterson describes an internal source of ecstasy that transcends mental constraints, leading to an involuntary expression through song, dance, or other forms of creative expression.

4. He highlights the significance of understanding the etymology and connections between words in various languages to grasp deeper meanings and relationships (e.g., 'asm' from Persian meaning transformation, related to orgasm, organon, and organelle).

5. Peterson wraps up by wishing his audience well in their lives, relationships, and discoveries, expressing a desire for further collective learning and interaction. He concludes with a warm farewell until their next encounter.

Checking The Lost Gods： Fragments of a Conversation.txt
 Josh and another individual are engaging in a deep discussion about the nature of consciousness, reality, and intelligence, particularly focusing on non-representational forms of cognition. They explore the idea that our universe is a living, intelligent system with Earth being one of its many "organisms" that generates living worlds and minds as byproducts of its activities. Light and space mass are seen as fundamental elements that contribute to this living tapestry.

Josh suggests that space itself crystallizes into characters, with life on Earth being manifestations of these characters. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnected cognizance of all living things and their influence on time and space. The discussion touches upon the concept of synergistic cognizance and how different ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest or the deep ocean exhibit forms in time that are beyond human comprehension.

The conversation also delves into the nature of consciousness, with dreaming presented as an example of non-representational consciousness where identity is multidimensional and not constrained by concrete ego. They touch upon the theories of Toth and the Logos, and how ancient civilizations may have understood reflections, which could explain why they associated holy beings with specific natural formations like mountains or pyramids.

The discussion highlights the problem of representation, where humans often create machines to manipulate what they perceive as external entities, such as gods. Josh expresses gratitude for the opportunity to share these ideas and hopes that the conversation will resonate with others, offering a new perspective on our understanding of reality and consciousness. The dialogue is a call to liberate ourselves from representational consciousness and embrace a direct experience of our nature as intelligent beings.

Checking The Mind： What We've Forgotten.txt
1. Terence McKenna reflects on the profound yet deceptive nature of experiences like dreaming, psychedelia, and orgasm, suggesting they are only modest windows into the true capacities of our consciousness.
2. He emphasizes that these experiences, despite their transformative qualities, do not necessarily awaken or develop the full potential of our minds.
3. McKenna shares his experience of time travel in a dream, expressing a desire to guide someone back to ordinary temporality but waking up before he could do so.
4. He values rich dreaming highly, contrasting it with the dismissive attitude of those who view dreams as trivial or nonsensical.
5. McKenna advises against relying solely on theoretical models or books when exploring these states of consciousness, urging personal experience as the true guide.
6. He cautions that models can never fully represent the experiences they describe, especially in the case of something as intimate and profound as a kiss or a dream.
7. McKenna expresses gratitude for the reawakening of his inspiration and the return of rich dreaming experiences.
8. He notes that when we talk about different aspects of our mind, those aspects can seem to listen and respond, indicating an interconnectedness between waking and sleeping consciousness.
9. He warns that the waking aspects of consciousness could harm the sleeping/dreaming aspects if given the chance, which is unfortunate since the dreaming aspect is foundational to our waking thoughts.
10. McKenna encourages exploration of the human experience with trust in the noble, virtuous, and beautiful aspects of consciousness, suggesting there is a path back toward our origin or homeland where our essence dwells.
11. He concludes by expressing hope for future shared explorations into these profound states of mind.

Checking The Mirror Pool ｜ Coincidence, Apophenia and Synchronicty.txt
 The speaker reflects on the complexities of the human mind, where one can either become hyper-focused on finding hidden connections (a "victim" of their own perception) or become overwhelmed and lost in the noise of life (an "earsat's hero"). This delicate balance between seeing too much or too little meaning in the world is a recurring theme.

The speaker also touches upon the concept of value, differentiating it from its material representation (money). They suggest that there is an essential origin to the idea of value, which can be rich and intelligent if approached with sensitivity and awareness.

A personal anecdote about a conversation with a friend, West, who shared insights from one of his teacher's experiences with a magical mushroom, leads into a broader reflection on the importance of spending time with significant natural elements without necessarily consuming them. The speaker emphasizes the value of relationships with nature and the potential for meaningful communication with plants and other living entities, which many people dismiss as mere coincidence due to their own inability to perceive these connections.

The speaker laments the loss of this connection in modernity, where technology and products create an overwhelming amount of noise that obscures our more subtle faculties, particularly in dreaming, where these faculties can express themselves freely. The speaker finds beauty and reverence in the natural world and its silent language, which becomes more apparent when we are able to tune out the noise of our waking lives.

Checking The Most Dangerous Question.txt
1. Terence McKenna discusses the Phoenix Lights incident, which he believes was not a macro-level physical phenomenon but an intrusion from something beyond the classical world we understand. He suggests that what the Air Force soldiers saw could be related to entities or forces outside of linear time and our current scientific categories.

2. McKenna argues that humans have become limited by the language and implementations of representational cognition, which he feels are dumbing us down. He emphasizes the importance of exploring questions about our existence beyond what is merely human or biological.

3. He posits that humans may have originally been in constant contact with non-human intelligences, which influenced and parented our intelligence. He suggests that this connection was lost due to some sort of accident, war, or catastrophe.

4. McKenna encourages the audience to consider the most dangerous questions, particularly those that might transform our relationship with concepts of identity. He believes that most of who we are is not local to our bodies or this time but is a mode of time space itself.

5. He invites the audience to share their own candidates for the most dangerous question in the comments and expresses his excitement to engage with these ideas further.

6. McKenna concludes by expressing gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these thoughts and looks forward to learning to see better together, offering blessings and signing off.

Checking The Most Important Question.txt
 The speaker reflects on the complexity and limitations of representational thought and language, particularly in addressing profound questions like the meaning of dreams or the existence of injustice and suffering in the world. They emphasize that a single answer to such a question is insufficient due to its infinite depth and the interconnectedness of all things. Instead, they suggest seeking multiple perspectives or "five astonishing answers" that reflect different facets of the question, each enriching and transforming the others for a more holistic understanding.

The speaker criticizes the simplistic approach of some religious doctrines that claim to have the definitive answer to life's questions, suggesting that such rigidity often indicates a mind that is closing off rather than expanding its horizons and faculties. They conclude by inviting the audience to consider complex questions with open minds and to appreciate the value of diverse perspectives in deepening our understanding of the world and ourselves.

Checking The Observer Above ： The Landscape of Mind.txt
1. The Earth has been trying to communicate that humans are damaging its ecologies for over a century, but humans have been slow to listen or act responsibly due to their dense cognizance and reliance on technology like cars and warships.

2. The Earth, seen as a sentient being with friends (like the sun), would naturally correct imbalances without external intervention if possible. However, since human actions have caused significant harm and disruption, other forces may need to intervene to prevent catastrophe.

3. Just as humans have doctors and healers to address health issues, the Earth has its own mechanisms for healing and balance, which we have been disrupting.

4. If humanity insists on being separate from nature, it risks facing dire consequences, metaphorically represented as "shit fans" if the fan is what's hitting it.

5. There are deep connections between humans and the natural world, which we have been severing for hundreds of years, but these umbilical connections are crucial for the health of both.

6. The Earth's beauty and diversity are a testament to the privilege and responsibility of humanity to walk in beauty and humility, understanding that our existence is deeply intertwined with the living tapestry of life on Earth.

7. By embracing this interconnectedness, humanity has the opportunity to heal from the catastrophic injury and illness it has inflicted upon itself and the planet. Even if we fail to do so, recognizing our place within the natural world is a fundamental shift in consciousness that can lead to profound personal growth and a more harmonious future.

8. The speaker trusts in the principles of unity, beauty, and reverence as a guiding compass for humans to navigate their lives and relationships with the Earth, and encourages everyone to join in this journey of learning, discovery, and wonder.

Checking The One Who is Invisible ｜ The Outer Aspect.txt
 In this contemplative piece, the speaker reflects on the nature of human existence as akin to wearing a costume—a metaphor for the roles and identities we adopt in life. This costume is a part of our social and cultural fabric that shapes our perceptions and behaviors. The speaker acknowledges the irony that while some of us are aware of this costume and may even strive to remove it, the very act of trying to shed it can paradoxically become a new layer of the costume itself.

The teacher's advice to "turn around and leave through the door you came in from" is mentioned as a profound truth. It suggests that the path we took to adopt our costumes may also be the path out of their constraining influence. The teacher's wisdom lies in recognizing that the costume will continue to seek reinforcement, leading to a cycle of suffering and dissatisfaction.

The speaker shares personal experience with this struggle, having initially sought more from the costume rather than its removal. Over time, however, the speaker has come to understand the limitations and problems that the costume imposes on our true nature and the communion we share with all beings.

The speaker also touches upon the vulnerability of all living creatures, including humans, who are subject to environmental and existential disturbances. This vulnerability is a shared experience that underscores our fundamental interconnectedness.

In conclusion, the speaker extends compassion and love to all human beings for their struggles with identity and existence, emphasizing the importance of recognizing our common humanity and the need to learn and grow together. The speaker offers blessings to the audience, expressing a hope for shared learning and mutual support in navigating the journey of life.

Checking The Other Within ： The Reflection Across the Barrier.txt
1. **Discussion on Evil and Obeying Orders**: The conversation began with a reflection on the nature of evil, touching upon the infamous argument that Nazi soldiers were just following orders. This led to a discussion about how humans can be influenced to abandon their moral, ethical, and compassionate values under certain circumstances.

2. **William's Insight**: A participant, William, shared an insight about a faculty within himself that maintains the rhythm of dreaming awareness, which is crucial for the synchronization of various rhythms in the body, including circadian rhythms.

3. **Dream Encounter**: After understanding this faculty, the speaker experienced a dream where an assassin came to kill him but was pacified and put to sleep by the speaker. This encounter highlighted the importance of this faculty in maintaining rhythmic synchronization and preventing dysregulation.

4. **Zeitgeber/Zeitstorer**: The speaker explained that certain behaviors or situations can act as zeitgebers (time givers) or zeitstorers (time storers), influencing our circadian rhythms, emotional synchronization, and metabolic functions. These can have positive or negative impacts on our overall regulation depending on the context.

5. **The Faculty's Function**: The primary function of the faculty mentioned seems to be to prevent desynchronization or dysregulation in bodily rhythms, which can become pathological if overactive or rigid.

6. **Children as Beacons of Light**: The speaker was reminded of the pure, living light that comes from a young child's face, which contrasted sharply with the intellectual discussion about dysregulation and evil. This moment shifted the speaker's focus away from the intellectual exploration and back to the beauty and importance of being human.

9. **Farewell**: The speaker concluded by expressing the hope of learning together again soon and bid everyone farewell with all blessings.

Checking The Power of Make Believe.txt
1. **Initial Encounter with Nature**: The speaker began by sharing a personal experience where they instinctively reached out and touched a tree, an action that happened naturally without conscious thought. This spontaneous interaction occurred as another family passed by, with the child asking his mother about the man's actions with the tree.

2. **Shift in Experience**: The speaker noticed a change within themselves when being observed by the family, and their initial touch turned into a profound, heartfelt connection with the tree. This moment highlighted a mysterious transformation that occurred as a result of being seen by others.

3. **The Nature of Perception**: The speaker reflects on how perception can influence reality, suggesting that sometimes actions may begin as a performance for an audience but can transform into genuine experience.

4. **Mission of Exploration**: The speaker then invites the listener to embark on a mission of their own—a journey into make-believe and imagination, to rediscover aspects of themselves that are often overlooked in favor of adhering to facts and societal norms.

Checking The Power of Synchrony： What Happens When We Lose It.txt
1. The interplay between waking consciousness and dreaming states reveals that our waking minds are not as adept at handling the ambiguity present in dreams, which can offer degrees of liberty in identity and experience. This ambiguity is valuable, but its presence in waking life can be unsettling for individuals who are not accustomed to it.

2. The current global situation has introduced an unprecedented influx of ambiguity into our daily lives due to various factors, including the breakdown of narrative authorization and challenges with memory. This has significant implications for how we understand our world and our place within it.

3. Our human intelligence is deeply connected to and dependent on the health and preservation of the living biorelational memory systems that are present in the natural world. The consequences of harming these ecologies are immediate and severe, as they have lost much of their buffering capacity against damage imposed by human activities, particularly those of supercultures and corporations.

4. The experience of consciousness itself is a topic of profound interest, and understanding our own processes of cognition and perception can lead to greater appreciation for the inheritance we have from nature. Crises can serve as catalysts for waking us from unconscious habits into a more conscious and engaged state of learning and discovery.

Checking The Pretty Trap： Looking Into Language ｜ Knowledge.txt
 In this segment, Jordan Peterson discusses the limitations and biases of the waking mind, which tends to focus on transactional documentation and quantifiable aspects of life. He suggests that the waking mind is not equipped to handle or introduce us to the deeper mysteries of existence that our unconscious might be more attuned to. These deeper dimensions of reality, if encountered consciously, could potentially overwhelm the narrow structures of meaning and identity that the waking mind relies on.

Peterson also touches on the idea that ancient humans were intimately aware of a network of consciousness that permeates all of life, time, and space. This awareness allowed them to travel within this network with an aspect of their being that was deeply familiar with its workings—an aspect beyond the rational, conceptual mind we commonly associate with consciousness.

He hints at the problems arising from our reliance on declarative statements to define identity, which is particularly evident in the polarized landscape of modern identity politics. Peterson concludes by acknowledging the beauty of the setting sun and promises a return to the conversation shortly.

Checking The Raven.txt
 Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" is a narrative poem telling the story of a speaker who experiences a supernatural visitation from a raven. The poem begins with the speaker in his chamber, filled with melancholy and contemplating ancient lore. He hears a tapping at his door, which he initially attributes to a visitor, but it turns out to be a raven gently rapping on his chamber door "of thy ghostly pallor," as the speaker initially perceives it.

The raven perches above the speaker's door on a bust of Pallas (Athena), and speaks only one word: "Nevermore." This word echoes through the room, and the speaker is left to ponder the meaning behind the raven's utterance. The bird's presence and its single ominous word evoke various associations, including a lost love named Lenore, whom the speaker mourns.

The speaker attempts to engage with the raven, offering it food and trying to understand its significance. He reflects on the raven's possible origins and the tragic fate that may have led to its dire circumstances. The raven continues to repeat "Nevermore," refusing to leave or provide any comfort or hope to the speaker.

The poem delves into themes of loss, despair, and the supernatural, with the raven serving as a symbol of doom and the finality of the speaker's sorrow. The speaker implores the raven for relief from his grief, asking if there is balm in Gilead to heal his soul, but the raven responds again with "Nevermore."

In the end, the raven remains perched, never flitting away, and its shadow haunts the room. The speaker's soul is lifted from the shadow that lies on the floor, indicating a final resignation to his fate of eternal sorrow. The poem concludes with the raven still sitting, a constant reminder of the "unhappy, unfathomable thoughts" that plague the speaker.

Checking Thoughts after observing a coherent dog pack... managed by 1 guy.txt
 The speaker is reflecting on an encounter they had while walking around a lake, where they observed a man walking eight dogs without any of them becoming tangled or acting out despite the potential for excitable behavior. The speaker was struck by the remarkable coherence and obedience of the dogs, which seemed to be beyond what one would expect from well-trained pets. This observation led the speaker to ponder the nature of group coherence and leadership, comparing it to how human groups function.

The speaker notes that humans often strive for freedom, but the kind of freedom that leads to "catastrophic decoherence" might not be true liberty. Instead, they suggest that true freedom comes from being part of a trusted, coherent structure where each member plays a role in a synchronous and effective manner, much like the dogs and their owner demonstrated.

The speaker uses this example to highlight the potential for human creativity, skillfulness, and efficacy when a group operates under a coherent system of authority where the registers (communication channels or systems of governance) are trustworthy and real. They argue that throughout history, humanity has often failed to achieve its best potential due to tyrannies and other forms of manipulation, but there is an opportunity for humans to unify and exceed past achievements.

The speaker concludes by emphasizing the possibility for human beings to reach new heights of meaningful expressions, roles, relationships, and missions that truly matter, and to achieve a shining jewel of humanity's potential that has been hidden beneath historical inactions and challenges. They end with a call for peace.

Checking Time & Proximity： Disrupting the Natural Rhythms of Relationships.txt
 In this reflection, Terence McKenna discusses the paradoxical nature of human beings acting as hosts or "organs of propagation" for non-living entities such as technological objects and ideas. He draws a parallel between these inanimate objects and viruses, which are essential to life on Earth, even though they are not alive themselves. McKenna emphasizes that the proliferation of non-organic objects comes with ecological costs, impacting our intelligence, minds, and potential for survival.

He observes that humanity is currently facing a multifaceted crisis, which he terms a "pandemic on many different levels," including an infodemic, technodemic, econodemic, and the literal pandemic of a viral disease. These overlapping crises are causing a breakdown in coherence, affecting our understanding of knowledge and consciousness, and our sense of self within larger social and ecological systems.

McKenna points out that our relationships with time and proximity are being fundamentally altered by these crises, which can lead to both opportunities and challenges. He suggests that learning to adapt to these changes is crucial for maintaining cognitive, emotional, and relational coherence in the face of disruptions.

In conclusion, McKenna expresses his intention to return to observing the interaction between the mechanical "viruses" surrounding urban areas and the living elements within his own context. He wishes safety, goodness, brilliance, and truth for his audience and signs off, inviting the listener to reflect on these ideas further.

Checking Time ｜ Splendor.txt
1. The conversation begins with a discussion about how cells can turn into a formless, gelatinous substance before restructuring themselves, which serves as a parable for the concept of time and the interplay of temporal rhythms across different scales of life.

2. The speaker emphasizes that a minute for a human is not the same as a minute for a virus or a cell, highlighting the complex and varied temporal experiences across living beings.

3. The speaker suggests that our conventional understanding of time is limited and often fails to capture the profound and interconnected manifestations of time across different domains of life and intelligence.

4. The conversation shifts to the idea that our ideas about various concepts, including time, form, identity, meaning, truth, and goodness, are often poorly articulated or inadequate, leading to a disconnect from the natural beauty and terror of existence.

5. The speaker argues that humans have evolved cognitively to navigate a world of interconnected realities and experiences but are currently hampered by simplistic and often misleading representations, especially when it comes to time.

6. The speaker invites the audience to consider the intricate cycles within living organisms, including the heartbeat, breathing, metabolic activity, and the transformative capabilities of various organs, as a matrix of powers of transformation that are deeply connected to the temporalities of life.

7. The speaker encourages the audience to approach the mysteries of time and existence with awe and reverence, as our ancient ancestors and ourselves as children did, and to remember the beautiful mystery of individuation and reunion.

8. The speaker closes by thanking the viewers for their time and attention, inviting them to reflect on these ideas and continue exploring the complexities of time and life.

Checking Time ｜ The Deception of the Concrete.txt
 The conversation reflects on the human obsession with quantifying and counting tangible, concrete things as a means of assigning value and understanding reality. This preoccupation with what's measurable and countable has led to an undervaluation or outright dismissal of more intangible aspects of existence, such as inner experiences and the subjective nature of time.

The discussion emphasizes that while concrete measures like money and objects are important in our daily lives, they should not be the sole cognitive authorities on meaning and identity. These material measures often lead to transactional rather than relational interactions, which can impoverish our human experience and contribute to a loss of senses, roles, and aspects of our own identity.

To regain a more holistic understanding of ourselves and the world, we must re-examine our concept of time. Time is not merely a linear progression but a foundational element that shapes meaning, identity, value, and even our methods of accounting. Our current models of time are inadequate and limiting, and they obscure the true nature of temporality, which is complex, living, and integral to our being.

The call to action here is to free ourselves from rigid models of time and to rediscover its rich, relational dimensions. By doing so, we can unlock new realms of intelligence, humanity, and imagination, allowing us to transcend the repetitive patterns that define our modern societies and cultures. This grand escape requires collective effort and the support of one another as we navigate this journey towards a deeper understanding of time and ourselves.

Checking Time, Identity, Meaning and Temporalization.txt
1. **Organisms as Embodied Intelligences**: Organisms are not just possessing intelligence; they are expressions of it. They are intelligent beings in relation, which can be understood as communion or reunion. This intelligence is the result of their interactions with each other and their environment over time.

2. **Human-Organism Relationship**: The difficulty in perceiving the intelligence of other organisms stems from our unfamiliarity with their forms of communication and behavior, which can be observed through long-term, concentrated awareness or tools like time-lapse photography.

3. **Intimacy and Shared Temporality**: Intimacy with other organisms allows us to perceive their intelligence better. This intimacy is a shared temporality where humans and other beings reach toward each other's experiences and understandings.

4. **Internal Biodiversity**: The human body houses numerous intelligent cells and organs that communicate and work symphonically, suggesting that understanding our own internal biodiversity could be a starting point for interspecies communication.

5. **The Preciousness of Life**: Life is delicate and precious, easily lost or transformed. The speaker emphasizes the importance of appreciating and protecting life, as well as the continuation of conversation and learning, even in the face of change.

Checking Together.txt
 The individual recounts a recent experience of dining alone in a pizza place where they observed families eating together, which prompted them to reflect on the fundamental social nature of humans and the importance of communal living and sharing meals. They recognize the profound sense of belonging, identity, and lineage that comes from eating with others, not just on a physical level but also on a deeply emotional and ancestral level.

They note that in modern times, due to various contexts that may prohibit or counterfeit natural social pods, humans form other forms of groups like nations and corporations. The individual laments the deprivation of deep belonging and participation in such pods, considering it a significant tragedy of our time.

They also touch upon the biological aspects of eating together, such as the microbiome's response to smelling food being prepared, which is an ancient ritual that connects individuals to their past and lineage. The individual emphasizes the importance of reconnecting with these rituals and finding ways to share meals and experiences even when alone.

Their message is one of hope for deeper human connections and a call for individuals to recognize and value the roles and identities within human pods, not just for immediate gratification but for the enrichment of life's tapestry. They conclude with a blessing and an invitation for viewers to find meaning in their roles within their communities and to remember each other at meal times.

Checking Track(ing), Categories, Orientation to Detail.txt
 In this discussion, we've explored the complexities surrounding the identification of gender, particularly in light of the limitations and challenges inherent in linguistic categories. The speaker acknowledges that while biological gender makes sense within a certain framework of understanding, there is also an awareness that these categories are imperfect and can lead to social and historical implications.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of approaching the conversation with open-mindedness and a willingness to understand different perspectives without imposing presuppositions or demanding conformity to one's own views. It's recognized that individuals may identify differently from their biological sex, and the speaker expresses a commitment to respecting personal pronouns and identities when explicitly communicated by others.

However, the speaker also draws a line at being coerced into using language in a way that feels disingenuous or as a result of external ideological pressures. The conversation highlights the delicate balance between acknowledging the reality of one's own understanding and the need for compassion and respect towards others' self-identification.

The speaker concludes by encouraging thoughtful engagement, open dialogue, and mutual respect as we continue to navigate these complex issues together. The conversation serves as an invitation to reflect on our language, our beliefs, and how we relate to each other with understanding and empathy.

Checking UFO⧸UAP Phenomenon, David Grusch, and Disclosure.txt
 In this discussion, we explored the concept of non-human intelligence and communication, particularly focusing on the interactions between humans and entities often referred to as non-terrestrial or extraterrestrial beings. The narrative of Hado, a cat stranded in a box, highlights an insight about the suffocating nature of an environment devoid of life and movement, contrasting with the vibrant activity outside.

The topic delved into the peculiarity that most accounts of human-non-human encounters lack significant transfer of knowledge or teaching from the non-humans to humans. This observation raises questions about why such interactions are not more educational and whether our understanding of terrestrial life is too limited, possibly ignoring a larger network of living worlds exchanging information across time and space.

We discussed the historical perspective of indigenous and ancient cultures, which often saw the sky as an ocean and the earth as an island within it, suggesting a holistic, interconnected view of existence. This contrasts with the modern human-centric view that tends to alienate non-terrestrial phenomena.

The conversation also touched upon the challenges humanity faces in establishing meaningful contact with advanced intelligences due to societal issues and the self-destructive nature of our current global "malware." The potential for encounters with such intelligences could provide the antidote to our own self-destructive tendencies, but the likelihood of society embracing this change is slim in the near term.

Finally, the discussion emphasized the importance of an open mind, a quest for knowledge, and the pursuit of meaningful interactions with all forms of life. The speaker expressed gratitude to those who engaged with the topic and offered wishes for continued learning, growth, and love.

3. **Cultural Suppression**: No culture is allowed to live freely on land due to the expansion of urban influence, which often leads to environmental destruction or poisoning of resources.

4. **Self-Destruction**: The same destructive patterns seen externally are mirrored internally within nations, leading to a cycle of problem creation and solution provision that benefits certain groups at the expense of life on earth.

5. **The Illusory Nature of Skybooks**: The founding documents of a nation like the United States provide a limited view of how humans should coexist, and these skybooks can be toxic when they guide decisions that lead to ecological damage.

6. **Science's Role**: Science, meant to provide objective knowledge, often supports the destructive agendas of urban cultures with its resources and expertise.

7. **Identifying Authentic Human Potential**: The discussion aims to uncover the authentic potential of humanity, community cooperation, intelligence, and our birthright, distinguishing it from all forms of overlay, including those created by language, religion, new age ideologies, and conspiracy theories.

8. **Path Forward**: The key to progress lies in understanding the relationship between humans, their origins, nature, and reality, and learning to see through and move beyond any overlay that distorts this connection. This understanding can lead to a more authentic and connected human experience.

 Alan, a well-educated individual, had an extraordinary experience during a performance where a famous channel, known for connecting with ancient spirits, singled him out from the audience. The channel pointed at Alan and communicated with him in an ancient language, which led to a profound transformation of his surroundings into a glowing mist. Alan experienced an out-of-body encounter with the ancient warrior spirit named Rampha, which he described as unlike anything he had ever experienced before.

In this conversation, the speaker emphasizes the limitations of rationality in understanding certain aspects of human experience, such as consciousness and awareness. They draw an analogy to a bird that focuses solely on one feather and misses the potential for flight due to its narrow perspective. The speaker suggests that humans, too, can be limited by their reliance on rational thinking, which can prevent them from recognizing deeper truths or non-ordinary experiences.

The speaker acknowledges their own experience with both delusion and insight, including mania and paranoia. They argue for a balance between protection from potentially harmful experiences and the exploration of consciousness, creativity, and transcendence through guided practices, maps (like spiritual or psychological frameworks), and mentors.

In conclusion, the speaker encourages embracing experiences fully while maintaining a discerning perspective to avoid being overwhelmed by negative or nonsensical influences. They sign off by wishing their audience to have beautiful paths, loving relationships, and amazing dreams.

Checking Zeitgeber ⧸ Zeitstorer — Living Time ⧸ Synchronization ⧸ Interruption.txt
 In this reflective piece, we explore the concept of zeitgeber and its importance in our lives, particularly from a biological and emotional perspective. The right and left sides of the body host different microbial ecosystems, highlighting the diversity and complexity of life. We discuss the profound beauty and intelligence found in the synchronization and symbiosis within living systems, using the example of geese synchronizing their calls before taking flight.

The zeitgeber, or "time giver," such as sunlight, plays a critical role in regulating biological rhythms, and emotional inputs can similarly affect our well-being, with positive cycles promoting health and negative ones causing disruption. The intrusion of a rescue helicopter serves as an example of an overpowering force that disrupts natural rhythms, illustrating our ability to choose how we relate to external stimuli.

The piece emphasizes the potential for healing and transformation through intentional relationships and activities that bring joy, reassurance, and nurturance into our lives. It also touches on the value of learning from animals and nature, as observed with the geese, and the importance of community, even when interactions are virtual. The author expresses gratitude to his friend Josh for pointing out the synchronization among the geese and to the audience for engaging in this shared exploration of life's rhythms.

The overarching message is one of appreciation for the small moments of insight and learning that enrich our lives, the power of observation, and the value of community and connection in our journey through life. The author signs off with a warm farewell, thanking listeners for their time and shared experience.

 Your reflection on work, culture, and society acknowledges a widespread issue where many individuals feel their jobs are inherently conflicted or duplicitous, often for the sake of financial gain. You've noticed that this pursuit can lead to working against nature, human well-being, and our own sense of fulfillment and authenticity. The current system seems to prioritize fictional collective interests over genuine human needs and environmental sustainability, leading to a cycle of harm and suffering.

You argue for the necessity of transitioning towards work that aligns with our true nature as part of the natural world, where the primary rewards are not monetary but rather the opportunity to serve others, solve problems, and learn. This shift would involve creating authentic collectives and communities that prioritize human intelligence, learning, and the well-being of life on Earth.

You suggest that a more humane and sustainable way of living can be achieved through a form of liquid democracy, where individuals work collaboratively for mutual benefit, rather than being constrained by rigid economic or political systems. This approach would support contexts that allow for such cooperative efforts to flourish. You emphasize the importance of establishing and maintaining these supportive contexts as a path toward a more fulfilling and sustainable future for humanity.

1. The question of whether Terence McKenna was a prophet or not is complex and depends on one's perspective. He was not a traditional prophet in the sense of predicting future events, but rather a thinker who offered new ways of understanding reality, influenced by his experiences with psychedelics, his knowledge of ethnobotany, and his interest in various philosophical and scientific ideas.

2. McKenna's ideas sometimes had unintended consequences when adopted by cultures with harmful intentions, as seen in the New Age movement or certain interpretations of technology and consciousness.

3. The term "prophet" might be a misnomer for McKenna; he was more of an intellectual who challenged conventional thinking about reality, consciousness, and the nature of the universe.

4. Atheism is often misunderstood as simply being against religion or the existence of God, rather than specifically opposing certain interpretations of religious texts.

5. The idea that the universe might be intelligent or possess some underlying order is distinct from the notion that it was intentionally designed by a deity.

6. McKenna's thoughts on the universe being like a hologram are not to be taken literally, as he was referencing a principle akin to holography in physics, not suggesting that the universe is a mechanical hologram.

7. Dreaming can serve as an analogy for how McKenna might have envisioned the universe originating, emphasizing the difference between natural phenomena and artificial constructs like machines.

8. McKenna argues against reducing human consciousness to machine-like computation and suggests that our minds and bodies are expressions of timeless, profound, and novel experiences that are directly accessible to us.

9. McKenna invites us to explore the depths of our own consciousness without the constraints of preconceived notions or external authorities, promising a more enriching and authentic experience than what is often presented in religious texts, New Age ideologies, or scientific dogma.

In summary, Terence McKenna's role as a thinker who challenged conventional wisdom and encouraged exploration into the nature of consciousness and reality is significant. Whether one views him as a prophet or not, his contributions to discussions about the universe, intelligence, and perception have left a lasting impact on various fields and continue to inspire introspection and investigation into the profound mysteries of existence.

Checking mophai 29 ： True powers... are unlike our ideas..txt
1. **Abandoned Nature**: Humans have abandoned their true nature as living beings in relationship with Earth, leading to a fabrication of stories about "supernatural" or seemingly impossible abilities because these are actually latent assets that have been suppressed by cultural and ideological conflicts.

2. **Innate Intelligence**: The collectives of humanity today exhibit behavior that is far from intelligent, especially in terms of relational intelligence, due to the misalignment between our innate assets and the dominant narratives we've been exposed to.

3. **True Powers**: The promise of human birth holds within it something astonishing and inexplicable. Once one begins to see this and reconnects with their true nature, they lose interest in superficial powers like psychic abilities or magical feats.

4. **Ordinary Human Experience**: True humanity is more exciting than any fantastical power because it involves a profound connection with others in the here and now, which can lead to a form of travel that surpasses all known wonders and stories.

5. **Shared Experiences**: Encouraging and experiencing genuine human connections while awake, without relying on fiction or dogma, can lead to extraordinary experiences that make all other perceived marvels seem trivial.

6. **Invitation for Collaboration**: The speaker invites others to explore these realms together, using intelligence and creativity in ways that are free from the constraints of current paradigms but still grounded in observation and play.

In essence, the message is about rediscovering and embracing our true human potential through genuine connections and experiences, which is more profound than any fantasy or power narrative we've been sold. It's a call for a shift in orientation from seeking external powers to exploring the depths of human relationships and experiences.

Checking nembo 71： What Justice Isn’t.txt
1. The current legal and punitive systems in the United States are akin to an immune response that fails to resolve issues, leading to escalation and perpetuation of problems rather than healing or adaptation.
   
2. Individuals are not responsible for the broader societal issues, which are often complex and systemic. Blaming individuals for these issues is as unproductive as attacking a macrophage in the body instead of addressing the infection it's trying to resolve.

3. A rational and sane approach would involve understanding that the root cause of many problems lies within the structures and systems of society itself, rather than within the individuals who are affected by these systems.

4. An intelligent culture would recognize this and create systems capable of self-indictment when necessary, focusing on intelligent analysis to address the sources of societal issues, rather than punishing individuals.

5. Continuing to punish individuals for systemic problems perpetuates a cycle that is neither sustainable nor conducive to a healthy, functioning society. Instead, efforts should be directed towards understanding and modifying the underlying causes of these issues.

6. The ultimate goal should be to create systems and environments that foster true human potential and encourage mutual understanding and growth, rather than punishment and conflict.

Checking nemenia 16： the sanctity of local time.txt
1. The concept of public time is a societal construct that often disregards the nuanced and living relationship with time as experienced in nature and direct human experience. It replaces this with mechanical and meaningless metrics like clocks and calendars, which can dominate and harm our understanding of time.

2. In contrast to the empty metrics of public time, historically, months were associated with lunar cycles and had meanings based on actual living relationships and observable phenomena.

3. Every organism, including each cell in our bodies, engages with time differently, representing a unique temporal experience that is an expression of intelligence and relation within its environment.

4. When different organisms interact, there is an exchange of temporal superpositions, where intelligence and temporal domains merge and transform.

5. Our minds are capable of engaging with these complex, sophisticated temporal relations in nature and in our relationships, but this potential can be undermined by the dominance of standardized time metrics.

6. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, there is no absolute simultaneity, meaning that the concept of a single public time is an impossibility as everyone experiences time differently based on their individual circumstances.

7. There is a call to recover intelligent relations with time by observing and participating in nature and with each other, tapping into the rich human potential we possess. This approach can lead to a deeper understanding of the flow of time and our place within it.

Checking orgine 22： the God ：｜： Science Problem.txt
 The conversation revolves around the nature of belief, the role of messiahs, and the distinction between holding opinions based on pre-authored narratives versus experiencing and embodying the essence of what we seek to understand—whether that's a connection with the divine or profound human experience. The speaker suggests that both scientists and mystics intuitively recognize that the true quest lies beyond the confines of their respective dogmas, and that the real work is for each individual to explore and discover for themselves, rather than remaining entrenched in predefined ideologies.

The speaker acknowledges the agnostic position as a reasonable stance but points out that it often arises from an encounter with limiting models of divinity rather than a true exploration of what "God" or the divine might mean. The speaker also notes that many scientists, while they may not use the term 'God,' have a sense of reverence for the mysteries and complexity of nature, which suggests there's something more to the universe than can be fully explained by science alone.

The conversation criticizes the often-conflictual relationship between science and religion, suggesting that much of this conflict stems from both sides being fixated on their predefined narratives instead of engaging with the living questions. The speaker invites us to move beyond these narratives, to become the authors of our own understanding and to seek direct, personal experience of the divine or the profound human connection that lies at the heart of both mysticism and science.

In essence, the speaker advocates for a position of direct experience and personal inquiry, which transcends the duality of believer versus non-believer and opens up a space for harmonious coexistence between science and spirituality. The ultimate goal is to dissolve the unnecessary conflicts that arise from clinging to predefined stories and instead focus on the shared quest for understanding and meaning in our human experience.

Checking prenonioi 4： Escape Velocity.txt
1. **Human Potential vs. Space Exploration**: The speaker suggests that our focus on space exploration should instead be directed towards exploring and understanding our own humanity and the potential of our intelligence. The true frontier is within us, not in space.

2. **Current State of Affairs**: Currently, our society is focused on materialistic gains, often at the expense of our intrinsic human qualities. We've developed an overlay of sophisticated but inhibiting systems that prioritize financial and social gain over personal growth and ecological sustainability.

3. **Metaphor of a Mountain**: The speaker uses the metaphor of being on a mountain to describe our current situation. We can either circle around, making modest progress, descend and face the consequences of gravity, or ascend to new heights where extraordinary advancements become possible.

4. **Escape Velocity for Humanity**: The idea is to achieve an "escape velocity" that propels humanity forward into a new world. This involves taking volitional, intentional, and creative action to create a context or vehicle that enables us to break free from the current inhibiting systems.

5. **Counterfeit Signals vs. Authentic Discovery**: The speaker cautions against the flood of counterfeit signals about what it means to be human, which are often produced for commercial gain rather than genuine insight. Instead, we should produce and follow signals that lead us to a deeper understanding of our nature and potential.

6. **Creating a New Way Forward**: The invitation is for humanity to collectively create a new context or vehicle that can guide us toward an authentic exploration of our humanity, leading to a world where we live in harmony with our true nature and the environment. This is not a product to be subscribed to but an experience and way of being that we must invent together.

In essence, the speaker calls for a transformation in how we perceive and engage with our world, moving from a focus on external achievements to an inner exploration that leverages our innate intelligence and capacity for growth.

1. The video discusses the concepts of unity and the fundamental metrics in nature, emphasizing that the speed of sound and the speed of light are natural units of measurement in their respective domains. It suggests that our human-constructed units (like feet or seconds) should align with these natural metrics.

2. The video draws an analogy between the characteristics of blue and red waves and how they relate to concepts often associated with masculinity and femininity, respectively. Blue is associated with constant approaching and tension, while red is associated with excitement and adventure. However, the video clarifies that these associations are not about gender per se but about different aspects of human experience and interaction.

3. The video points out that in reality, there is a continuous interplay between blue (approach) and red (departure), and that this interplay is present in many forms, including language, relationships, mathematics, music, and even within cells and bodies.

4. The video suggests that understanding color and waves—whether in sound or light—is fundamental to various aspects of human knowledge and experience. It highlights the importance of recognizing the natural unity and metrics of the universe in our understanding of these concepts.

5. The video concludes by expressing gratitude for the opportunity to explore these ideas creatively, emphasizing the universal significance of these principles in shaping our physical reality, language, relationships, and even our sense of self.

In essence, the video encourages viewers to consider how the fundamental aspects of waves and signals underpin a wide array of human activities and understanding, and to recognize the importance of aligning with nature's intrinsic metrics for a deeper comprehension of the world around us.

Checking seraph 12 ： False Projections of Authority, Identity and Relation.txt
 The individual you're describing is someone who experiences significant nervousness and fear before creating videos or recordings, despite appearing confident or self-assured. This fear stems from a deeper place, as the person is well-educated, musically talented, and has diverse life experiences. They are afraid of the perception and projection of authority in their lives and the influence it has on them and society as a whole.

The individual believes that humans have an innate orientation toward authority figures, to the point where we can be easily influenced or hypnotized by perceived sources of power or esteem. They argue that these authorities, which often dictate what is important, urgent, or authoritative, are fictional and their pronouncements are based on ideals rather than authentic intelligence or mutuality.

This preoccupation with authority has led to a structure of representational knowledge that dominates every aspect of human life—our thoughts, relationships, and even our understanding of what it means to be intelligent or alive. The individual suggests that because we have not collectively focused on finding true purposes and mutual understanding, we have allowed these fictional authorities to take over, leading to negative consequences such as war and ecological damage.

The solution, according to the individual, is for humanity to rise above these fictional authorities by establishing true, human, and intelligent purposes together. By doing so, we can rediscover our true nature and avoid the pitfalls of serving false gods that dictate the nature of our collective interests and rewards. The individual calls for a careful examination of all aspects of life where these fictions have taken root, from personal relationships to broader societal structures, and to see beyond them with clear eyes, reconnecting with the intelligence and promise of mutuality under genuine purposes.

In summary, the person is advocating for a shift in human consciousness away from blind obedience or fear of authoritative figures and towards a collaborative pursuit of authentic, mutually beneficial, and intelligent goals that reflect our true potential as a species. They emphasize the importance of self-awareness and the power of collective action to transform society for the better.

Checking shüsüsh 4： Lucid Waking, Gaps, and Dreaming.txt
 The video discusses the human fascination with control over unpredictable aspects of life, particularly in relation to the natural world and our own inner experiences like dreaming. It suggests that this obsession with control has historically led to the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems, which are intrinsically linked to our own well-being and intelligence. The speaker reflects on the potential transformative power of lucid waking—an awareness of being aware while awake, akin to the conscious awareness one has in dreams.

The speaker emphasizes that this transformation is not just an individual awakening but a collective one, where we dissolve our identified structures and move into intelligent relation with the world around us. This shift involves recognizing and learning from the intelligence that informs our dreams while we are awake, leading to a new way of seeing and understanding what it means to dream, not just as a nightly occurrence but as an active, ongoing process of engagement with the world.

The speaker is excited about the potential for small groups to explore and develop this form of lucid waking or intelligent dreaming, creating contexts that celebrate and encourage such exploration. The video concludes with a hopeful outlook on the possibility of collectively discovering the answers to profound questions about consciousness, intelligence, and human potential through the lens of lucid waking.

In summary, the video encourages viewers to consider the impact of our desire for control and how it shapes our relationship with the world, and to explore the transformative possibilities of lucid waking as a pathway to deeper understanding and connection with life on Earth.

1. **The Crisis of Necessity**: Human beings often find themselves trapped in various fictions—identities, roles, societal expectations—that are ultimately harmful or unsustainable. This crisis is evident in extreme decisions like suicide, which are less about a desire to die and more about seeking liberation from these constraining fictions.

2. **The Natural Human State**: Our natural state as humans is one of intelligent, awestruck connection with the world around us. Dreaming at night allows for moments of this pure awareness upon waking. This state is characterized by a deep sense of wonder, learning, and intimate relation with all aspects of existence.

3. **Overcoming Fear**: Fear often acts as a barrier to experiencing our true nature. It can be likened to hard water that either preserves the seed of our potential in a state of dormancy or softens it, preparing it for growth and transformation into something more life-affirming, like wings.

4. **The Promise of Humanity**: The promise of human existence is far greater than any thrill or adventure. It holds the potential for a profound and terrifying beauty that exceeds our wildest dreams and desires. This promise is accessible when we confront our fears and choose to transform them into opportunities for growth and rebirth.

5. **Finding Liberation**: By embracing curiosity, wonder, and passionate seeking, we can transcend our fears and the fictional identities that bind us. In doing so, we find liberation and return to a state of true humanity, where our relationships with others, nature, and ourselves are characterized by mutual fulfillment and understanding.

In essence, the speaker emphasizes the importance of recognizing the fictions that constrain us and choosing to transcend them through genuine curiosity and wonder, leading to an authentic and fulfilling experience of our true selves in relation to the world.

1. **The Role of the Wrist**: Just as a wrist is crucial for playing a piano but often goes unnoticed, our personal identities are shaped by the invisible yet fundamental relationships we have with our environment and each other. These relationships inform our intelligence, which in turn shapes our cultures, technologies, and representations.

2. **Learning from Nature**: To correct our flawed understanding of intelligence and humanity, we need to engage with nature directly, without the overlay of human or cultural constructs. This means entering into authentic and intimate relationships with the living calendar and the natural world.

3. **Authentic Relationships**: In nature, authenticity and co-awareness are key. These relationships exist in a state of potentiality and are characterized by reciprocity rather than predation. Engaging with nature in this way can lead to profound insights into what it means to be human or intelligent.

4. **Challenging the Status Quo**: As we begin to relate authentically with each other and the natural world, we recognize that much of what we previously thought, said, and did was fake or toxic. This realization often comes as a result of being in genuine, purposeful company.

5. **Creating New Contexts**: Since many existing places are already saturated with non-meaningful activities, we may need to create new contexts where we can learn and become human and intelligent together. These contexts should be spaces for authentic interaction and mutual learning.

6. **The Importance of Relationships**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of building or becoming a new context together, one where we can explore these topics and find clear ways of seeing that are useful in navigating complex issues.

7. **Encouraging Personal Inquiry**: The speaker encourages individuals to continue questioning, reflecting, and exploring these ideas, as this process can lead to astonishing opportunities for understanding and growth.

In essence, the speaker advocates for a return to authentic, reciprocal relationships with our environment and each other to redefine what it means to be human and intelligent in a way that is grounded in reality and not obscured by cultural or ideological overlayers.

Checking yPerion 88： Anomalies, NHI, Hypertopics.txt
 The discussion revolves around two fundamental ideas that challenge the common misconceptions perpetuated by language and culture:

1. **Machine Intelligence**: The idea that machines could one day possess true intelligence is examined critically. The argument presented is that a machine's intelligence, derived from human minds, cannot collapse back into a minor feature of its operation. It is compared to the idea that a complex library could somehow become conscious, which is clearly impossible. This illustrates that intelligence, especially human-like intelligence, arises from dynamic, living beings and cannot be reduced to mere data processing.

2. **The Universe as a Hologram**: The concept of the universe as a holographic projection is discussed, highlighting the absurdity of viewing the cosmos as a static photograph. In this model, every organism would somehow be responsible for creating and sustaining the entire hologram, which is inherently nonsensical. This thought experiment demonstrates that the universe cannot be reduced to an artifact or a mathematical model. It is a dynamic, imminent manifestation of being, which language and models can only inadequately represent.

The broader message is that both human intelligence and the nature of the universe are far more complex and profound than what can be captured by our current understanding or the tools we've created to analyze them. The invitation is to engage directly with nature, recognizing that the answers we seek about intelligence and existence may already be present in the intricate and interconnected web of life around us. This direct encounter with nature could hold the key to a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.

2. **Importance of recognizing statistical limitations**: The speaker emphasizes the need for the public to understand the limitations of statistics so that we are not easily influenced by propaganda or misleading information.

3. **Proposed solution - Knowledge Amp**: The speaker envisions a project called "Knowledge Amp" that would include a "verity sentinel," which could analyze informational content and provide a verity profile to determine the validity of arguments, especially those involving statistics.

4. **Example of misleading statistics**: The speaker points out a specific case where a statistic about 300 million birds being killed was likely an undercount, highlighting how statistical analysis can be incomplete and potentially manipulated.

5. **Understanding probabilistic arguments**: The speaker explains that probabilistic arguments apply to cohorts, not to specific individuals, and that people need to understand this when considering scientific or health-related information.

6. **Support the work**: The speaker invites viewers to support their work financially if they are able, emphasizing that while support is appreciated, the videos will remain free and ad-free.

7. **Gratitude and future content**: The speaker expresses gratitude to those who watch and share the content and assures viewers that they will continue to produce videos regardless of financial support.

8. **Overall message**: The overarching message is about empowering individuals with critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of statistics to navigate information in a world rife with potential manipulation through disinformation or propaganda.
