Drinking whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome to tonight's Wednesday Night Bible Study
at Lady Babylon Season 4
It's nice to see everyone
What we're gonna do tonight is take you into the deep
Get ready for this, okay? Get comfortable
Get your seat set up
You're sittin' there on that throne of Satan
Right in that spot
You are the morning star
Yeah, you are the morning star
You are in that throne
You are euthronic
That's an orphic word
For those of us who are learning the orphic speech
Fish, hurry up and figure out Dragontown
Tonight on Lady Babylon
We'll be looking at the Alpha and the Omega
And we'll have us just a short clip
That will satisfy the appetites of all you necromancers
I've been very much looking forward to this
What we're gonna do right off the bat
Before we jump up the Alpha and the Omega
Is we're going to invite a guest in
This is Chuck Baudelaire
Chuck, say hello to everybody
We're going to give you just a vision's moment
Of the great poetry of the Revenant
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Thank you Chuck, that was very nice
That was very nice
Digest that
Take that symbol
Remember we're looking at the Saturnian verse
And Chuck is a master of the Saturnian verse
Yes, and so are his translators
Yeah, at least one on Flecker
Flecker, we gotta hunt down that guy
Okay, tonight I want to jump right into the Bible
Because here we are, this is our opportunity
And you guys know, this is all going according to a schedule
And our apocalypse will proceed accordingly
Tonight we're gonna look at Jesus Christ
We're gonna look at Jesus Christ
Let's look at him, I need the first reference, Chewie
Throw it up there, hit it
Excellent
I am the one who is, and who was, and who will be
I am the Ponto Crattor
Take it down, and you say, okay I got just about all of that
I got all of that up to that Ponto Crattor thing
And the evangelicals run around and they're like
Alpha to Omega, hoo hoo ha ha
Guessy guess, and tickle me fancy
Nothing comes out of it, but fairy tale
That you and I are dancing to
Like a bunch of zombies
I love it
Nobody looks at the end of that
Nobody looks at the end of that
Bring that up again Chewie
What is this word here? Ponto Crattor
Who is that?
Jesus Christ, give me the next slide
Look at this, look at this
Here's our word on the right
Look at it on the right here, we have Ponto Crattor
And this is the peculiar feminine
Of that form, Ponto Crattor
And why is it peculiar? Because it predates
It predates the stuff that you're using
Oh, so it's a feminine
Yeah, just like don't worry
It's Orphic Greek
And it is just like the Soter
And the Sotera
And it turns out just like Jesus Christ
Was not the first savior
Yeah, he was also not the first Ponto Crattor
Both of those forms are used earlier
Of a woman, both of them
It's not that the form is feminine
It's that it predates the masculine
Huh, well that's interesting
You can't screw around with Chronos, man
You just can't do it, this stuff is too hot
Okay, it's hot, you feel it?
Sizzling, it's sizzling
Let's get into Jesus Christ and the Alpha and the Omega
That formula by the way
That he put up there, the one that is
And the one that will be
Yeah, the one that was
Yes, repeated over and over and over again
That, my friends, is sibling oracle
That's what you're smelling
When you
You're like, oh, you smell the dank
Tonight we're getting the dank
Right, this is the dank
Are you on the throne?
Are you out there?
I know you are
Yeah, let's go to the next one
Pull it up, fantastic
Who is this one?
Who is this one?
I just want you to look
Just really quick here
I'm gonna have to put my glasses on
This is ridiculous
Here, I'm gonna pull up my own copy
People, I'm sorry
I'm sorry about that
Oh, there we go
There we go, good
Look at this, who is this?
This is the tenth
Him in the Orphic hymns
Yeah, and who is this?
This is nature
Nature for everybody who says
Those people worship nature
Bad
Those people that do that
Historically, and there are always
There are always people that do that
These are the people that are doing that
Those people are not liking them doing
And I just want you to notice
In the top line, this is nature herself
And she is that all mother
She is that all mother
You know what beats a Nazi?
A mother
Yeah, it's crazy
I don't know the physics I don't get
But that's what the psychologists say
Post WW2
That's nice
I want you to notice that
Polumejane is on that first line
Polumejane
Yeah, she has many ways of doing things
That was not an earthquake
She has many ways of doing things
Yes, she has great intelligence
Yeah, she does not need the mail
You know, that's what she...
Read the text
Read the text, yeah
She does the father and the mother
Yeah, wow
Who is this?
Who is this?
I want you to just...
I want you just to notice
All of the old, old, old Greek forms
That we've gotten this
And notice there's a cosmetera
Oh my God
She is that cosmic, complete mother
That starry-faced asteropy
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
The selasphora
Isn't that nice?
The bringer of that light
That torch
Yeah, these are nightly rites
Remember, we're working in...
We're working in...
Environment of nicks
These are offerings to nicks
That we're performing
Fantastic
Okay, give me the second part of that text
Hang on, one second
No, let's see
We're looking for the pantocratera
Help me look here, people
It'll be a little game
Oh, here it is
It's online, one, two, three, four
Look on that fourth line down that first word
Pantocratera
There's what we're looking for
That was the meat underneath
You guys thought we were lost
Don't worry, Aphrodite is with us
And it doesn't hurt
It doesn't hurt
To have that motherly love
When Addis is being educated
Right?
You understand?
This is the cult
This is the cult
This is the pre-Christian
Orphic cult
Bronze age
That you people had took over
I'm talking to you evangelicals
You know what I'm talking about?
Your savior
Your Jesus Christ
I'll show you the Christed one
I'll show you, he took it
It's all feminine modeling
It is
Anyway, on the fourth line down
Look, we've got the pantocratera
She is that one
When Jesus says I am
He's doing it with the oracular
I am, I was
And I will be
Remember, be practical
You can make lozenges
Things like little pills
That size
And you make them out of drugs
You make them out of drugs
And you take the drugs
You take that down
We'll put the next one up in a second
You take those drugs and you stick them
Into your rectum
Because that's how the medication is applied
And that's why I say the angels always have
Their middle finger is stinky
Right?
Because they have the seals
Don't you think when John was having his vision
After he breaks the seal
Do you know that's an expression
For administering a suppository?
Oh, you didn't
I'm sorry, it can also be for the vagina
Yes, yes
Okay, so angels
Middle finger, smells
Yes, when you were in Sodom and Gomorrah
You've got to learn the rules
Yes, definitely
Let's go on
This is pleasurable
And you people are crazy for being here
Absolutely crazy
But we'll show you the alpha and the omega
You guys want to see it?
We'll show you
Remember, we're toning
The Greeks are using their vowels
As celestial spheres
And they are tuning their logos
Yeah, fantastic, fantastic
It's like a fetus
It's like a fetal pie
Let's go
Is anybody else hungry?
Let's go to the next
Let's go to the next...
Yeah, this is way...
Yeah, this is...
Let's go to the Pantocratera
There we go, this one
Excellent, yeah
I just wanted you to see, by the way
They list the Orphic hymn 10-4
Just keep that in mind
That's the one that we're looking at
Okay, let's keep going down
Yeah, let's go down there
I want you to see the verb meadow here
Yeah, protector rule
Yeah, used by Homer
That med root
And Roman numer number two, meadow my
To provide for the mindful
To plan or contrive or devise
Let's go to the next one
Okay, look at this med root
Medeon from meadow
One who, you know, rules a ruler
A guardian, a guardian
Wait, look at number two
What, medusa?
Guardian goddess of Aphrodite
It's used of Aphrodite
Did you know that Aphrodite was a medusa?
Oh, I don't think you did
But it's sexy, isn't it?
It's incredibly sexy
What else is it used of?
Nemosinie
Everybody knows who that is, right?
Take it down for a minute
Put it back, right, Becca?
Nemosinie
Let's hear something from Nemosinie
Mother of the Muses
Remember that
Remember her name
Yes, remember
Okay, let's go back
Go back to that same
We found Nemosinie
Yep, yep, yep
And then just look down
Who else?
Nemosinie is there
Oh, a palisthenia
Oh, that's nice
The virgin
The virgin medusa
Of course, everybody knows
Everybody knows that the virgin
Is associated with this toxicology
Of the medusa
Who are the rulers
And if you look down here, it's great
You see Artemis
You see Artemis and the toxon
Oh, and you know
Take it off
You know you've landed squarely
In that Bronze Age cult now
As soon as you see Aeropoison
You know, okay
Let's go one more with med
Last one with the med
Yeah, here, maydomae
Now, when I look, we adjusted
Look what we're doing, people
You cannot learn this somewhere else
And it would be wrong to ever charge
For this
It would be wrong
We, everybody here has a right
To know this stuff
I wouldn't say it's a right
I'd say it's some kind of cosmic privilege
Yeah, cosmic privilege
Let's look, let's tune
Let's tune, look what we're doing
This one's maydomae, right
We're lengthening that vowel
What happens when we skip
Skip one of the holy spheres
And jump from three to four
Right, what happens
To plan and do cunningly or skillfully
To plot and contrive to invent
To take care by watching, okay
Let's go one more
And what happens when we, go ahead
And what happens when we turn that up like that
Look at that, that vowel is longer
All of a sudden we get genitals
Genitals
And look who they cite
Andromachus, Apu Galen
You people, you people
Look what you've got
Urine, fantastic
Take that down, fantastic
We ended up with the urine
Right, because that's where it comes from
And if
Apuleus is to be believed
It doesn't actually smell like urine
It smells like a brothel
And if you thank Nero
Was interested in this chemistry
You would be right
You would be right
You would be right
So is Augustus
I know that
Classes don't know that
They will know that
But they don't know it now
Yes, shame
The watchers by the way
None of the classes just get out
Right
They have to serve their sentence
That's the word up
Word from devil
Right, straight from the devil
Classes don't get out
Right
We're gonna have to
We're gonna have to
Let them know
They let us down
They let us down
But that goes for Bible scholars
Double
Yeah, double
Those guys
Yes
And gals
Although they
Tend to be guy heavy
You know
Something about wearing a veil
In public or something
Something about, yeah
You know
Yeah, it was before
Any sort of liberation
Yeah, from the
From the cheese
That bubbled out of the fungus
That took down the Roman Empire
Yeah, the dark medieval
Christian era
To which we are very happily
Skippily returning
Right
And everybody should recognize this
Right, welcome
Welcome
We welcome with open arms
In open arms
The guy from Brown
The professor from Brown said
It'll take him 10 years
To catch up
10 years to catch up
Okay
So
Future past
One present
Know yourself
Right
This is so
This is good stuff
This is the
Oh, God, love it
Let's keep going with sources
This is just to
We can't leave this alone
Can you blow that up, Chew it all
Can we
Can we get a good
Oh, you know what I wanted you guys to see here
Look at the idea of Zoe
It's on the fourth line from the bottom
Idea of Zoe
Remember how I was yelling at people
Telling them
You don't know about eternal life, right
Because Bible didn't say
Jesus didn't say
I'll give you eternal life
It doesn't say that
He says I'll give you ionic life
Right
Well, here
Is the line for what is
True eternal life
Ideos
Ideos
That does mean
Unceasing
Yeah
Yeah
But what Jesus said it was not
He said I'll give you
I'll give you drug heads
The life that you're in the ion
I'll give you that
You can bring it here
Watch me
I can stop the winds
Wah
Cast out demons
Oh
I'm the Christ
Where's my naked boy
Yeah
Yeah
It was an unfortunate
It was an unfortunate mistake
And that's why we have to
Sweep
Swoop in now
This time in history
And sweep up the detritus
And take him off to jail
Look
But here's the reference
This is to her
This is to
Fusus
To nature
This is to Urania
This is to her
And who is she
A thousand years before Jesus
She is eternal life
Yeah
That's why he
Jesus is wearing her
Aphrodite
Girdle
Her accoutrement
Yeah
Did you know Jesus cross dressed
Only in the apocalypse
Right
There ought to be a club
In LA called the apocalypse
And in order to get in
You have to dress up as Jesus
Cross dressing
Yeah
I would go
To that club
And I would drink
Whatever it was
That they were serving
In order to get in touch
With that power
Yeah
That's awesome
They used to say
The Balkans always lead to Aphrodite
They always lead to Aphrodite
Ace Aphrodite
You can hear the club music
You can hear it
Right
Oh my god
It's gorgeous
Let's keep going with the Greek
Before I dance away
Let's keep
Let's go to the next one
We're running out
We're running low on time
I want you to
Please blow it up
I want you to see
This little bit about Cersei
Look at you starting
This is from the Orphic Argonautica
We approached the beach
And we bound the ship to the shore
With the rocks
Jason sent beloved crewmen from the ship
To go and inquire
Is what kind of men lived
In this great land
And to learn about the cities
And the settlements of the people
All right fine
But suddenly
There arrived the maiden sister
Of noble EETs
A daughter of Helios
Oh okay hold on
This is where it gets gorgeous
A daughter of Helios
Whom they call Cersei
Whose mother was
Asterope
Asterope and if you can
Eat and breathe
Ancient Greek
You know when you say
Asterope
You know who that is
Yeah
Gorgeous
This is
Gorgeousness
And Gorgeosity
And her father
Far shining Hyperion
The son
The son
She quickly came down to the ship
And what happened
All were struck
Dumb by the sight
Wait
Wait what
Yes
I'm going to show you this verb
And it precisely means that
To be struck
To the point of being incommunicado
Yeah
You cannot
You cannot reach out
You're stuck
I told you those angels
Take it down for a second
We'll bring it back
Those angels with the fingers
That smell
This one
They
Right
Right
Yeah it's those guys
If you trust those guys
You're going to end up seeing things
You're going to end up seeing things
You break those seals
Oh
You're going all the way
From alpha to omega
And that's exactly
What I am going to show you
How to go
Alpha to omega
This is awesome
Okay let's go
Bring us up some more
This godless Greek
Okay no that one
Perfect perfect perfect
And then what happens
All were struck dumb by the sight
From her head
Hung hair like rays of light
Her beautiful face showing up
And her breath
Bright with flames
Okay pull it down
With flames
Oh man
I am so so
In that
Phoenician place
Yeah
Yeah
Those Canaanites dude
Oh my god
You should see the dance floors there
Okay
We can't go back to Armageddon
Right
We can't go back to Armageddon
Did I tell everyone
I'm going to take a little extra time
Satan will give me a discount tonight
I'll pay but not as much as
You have to worry about
Those dance floors
That you could discover
In of Canaanite temples
Yeah way under the stuff
The later ugly ages stuff
Which is what I call them
The darkness of the iron
Those were terrible times
Yeah
And their architecture was terrible
Anyway the good stuff that's underneath
The really good stuff like those
Canaanite dance floors
That's what we found
Canaanite dance floor
And those two guys got up
One night after another I was asleep
It's 2 a.m. I'm exhausted after
Carrying dirt all day long
And this guy sits up in bed
And the guy that's sleeping there
Asked me his name's Moshe
And he just starts talking like a
Like a growling mechanical dog
It sounded like
And I told him knock it off
Because he was saying weird stuff
And I was like okay enough
I thought he was joking or something
You know it was weird but
You know I don't know he's dreaming maybe
Anyway he runs off the next day
And has to be taken to a mental hospital
And another guy stays
The next night the other guy
He did the same thing
And what was funny
And he ended up running off the next day
The Israeli police went after him
But this is all in an excavation
Involved with the site of Armageddon
So when I first thought it was a joke
I couldn't the second night
When the guy did it the second night
And he said the same things
The first guy did
I was like alright as a scientist
If you're not into that
You're not into anything you know what I mean
Okay let's go back to
From the Armageddon here
To Alpha to Omega I'm supposed to tune
Right is this thing working

Enter a phase of being
Dumbstruck

This is not the 70s.
What they did in the 90s in Israel, they call them discos.
And the people there understand that milk.
Yeah, the milk of prophecy.
I want some, don't you?
I want, who wouldn't want the milk of prophecy?
Who wouldn't?
I would.
It's pagan though.
It's pagan and mystery, not like modern Christianity.
I'm talking the original Christianity.
Talk about that mystery.
Yeah.
OK, let's keep going.
I'm going way over.
Way over in that, guys.
It's OK.
People will forgive me.
Yeah, here's what.
It's full of that milk, yeah?
And then he talks about, as the breasts of the proto-toku
no face.
Wait a minute, isn't that the same word we just saw?
Isn't Jesus one of those?
Yes.
Again, a title for that nursing nymph.
That nursing nymph.
Go ahead, take it down.
That nursing nymph, that fruitful goat.
Yeah.
Yeah, what are they talking about?
Remember, you had to be in their place to really understand.
You have to be in there as close as you can get in there.
This is not.
We've gone way past academic theories.
We don't need any academic theories.
Thanks, Harvard.
We don't need them.
Unproductive.
We need the text.
Give me another text.
Public text.
I've got to keep the string going.
This is too much.
Yes.
Who do we have here?
I just wanted you to see that we are talking about the kurei,
the kurei, the kora, the daughter.
Aetao, the daughter of Aetis.
Yes.
And who is she?
She is the polumejanos.
She is the polumejanos.
Take it down.
Polumejanos, where do we see the polumejanos?
We saw that in the very first line of the Orphic hymn.
The very first line of the Orphic hymn.
And these hymns predate Christianity
by at least six centuries.
I'd put it back more.
I'd go back to the eighth or ninth.
Yeah.
Based on the language.
Love it.
Love it.
OK.
Bring that last passage up again.
Yeah.
Polumejanos.
Go ahead, take it down.
Bring up after that.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to see here.
This is from Alice.
Hello, Alice in Wonderland.
It's nice to be with you.
It's nice to be with you.
Don't worry.
He was looking for something resourceful, inventive.
It's an epithet of Odysseus.
Right?
Odysseus is considered polumejanos.
It's used of Apollo.
Oh, and wait a minute.
When you combine it with the noun metered,
you're referring to nature.
Yes, that resourceful mother.
Yeah, gorgeous, gorgeous.
We have to remember that these mysteries,
that they're exercising in antiquity,
that these are coming from a tradition
and that that tradition is originally
based on late Bronze Age performance that
involved drugs and the queen of a people
and not one of these weak queens.
You look at the crown today, any of them in the world.
I'm not talking that.
I'm not talking that.
That's a joke.
I'm talking cercean so that you know.
That's right, take out.
Open that pouch and take out your purple.
Put it in your eyes.
You know how it works.
Put it in your eyes.
The angel will be coming in shortly.
Knock, knock, knock.
He's got the suppositories.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Right?
You've got the cercean, which is what they called it, right?
And at least in the first century,
they called it the cercean.
And the only reason we have that knowledge
from guys like Dioscorides and Scrobonius Largus
is that they had access to the emperors who
were preserving this.
Gustus is one of them.
Nero is one of them.
And now Yale and Harvard and not Princeton and Stanford.
Yeah, you people, Michigan, there's good people.
Jump.
Jump on this.
Look at the Andromachus.
Yes, look at Nero's position.
Yes, oh, it's such good stuff.
And it's so filled with code, right?
You didn't know before you came today
that a trochiscus was something you stuck in your rectum.
And it dissolved and gave you a vision.
You didn't know that, did you?
Well, they did.
This is how life went, right?
And it turns out there was a lot of good health.
There's a lot of good health stuff there.
Yeah, and we very foolishly walked away from it.
And the technology, now we've got the programming speeds.
Let's figure this thing out and bring her back.
And that way, we can all eat fetal pie, right?
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
No, I'm not.
Hail Satan.
Go ahead and drink and whiskey.
