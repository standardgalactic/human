We're the ones with boys in these kisses
Out of 60 time witches
We're the ones with boys in these kisses
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
Boy, do we have something good for you tonight
Thanks to Teddy
Thank you, Teddy, for bringing us in
I'm going to let Teddy purify us as well
Bring them up the gateway
Yeah, the Teddy gateway
Let's do this
People, what are we...
What are we coming to? Take that thing down
They can go back and stop this
Excellent
What are we going tonight?
We've got to have our stuff together
Because this is deeper into the mystery
And anyone is gone
Deeper than anyone is gone
I need you to follow
I need you to sit on that throne
Be on that throne
And I need you to take the purification
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready?
I'm going to have Chewie roll us the purification tonight
Right off at the beginning
Because this is our chorus
This is our chorus
And our chorus is being brought to us tonight

Oh God, if we can bring her image back
I was looking for her the other day
I was looking for where'd she go
Where'd she go? Tonight
The object is to get off of the spaceship
Right? We got the time thing going
Get out of here
And what we're going to do is
We're going to go right to her
Going to go right to the Christ
Going right to her
God, I've got some stuff for you
You're not going to find this
You're not going to find this
Anywhere else
Yes, definitely
Here it is, people
And tonight we have several different ghosts
They're just going to jump on in
We're just going to free it up
We're just going to do it all the way
Let's do it
Bring my first
Bring him up
Look, what is this?
Who is this?
Oh, Gailen
Welcome, Gailen
We haven't had you here
Everybody had like you to meet
The personal body physician
Of Marcus Aurelius
Now, he had other connections
I'm not forgetting those
But that's really
That's really something to be proud of
Right?
Comedist, are you kidding?
Oh, shoot
Here he is
And he says, look, people
Now, I'm just going to
I'm just going to fill you in
I've got a work by a doctor
Who worked for Nero
He was his chief physician
And in it
Gailen says, look, he's about to give us
The work, right?
It's dactylic hexameter
And he's prophesying it
And he's saying, look, look
In it is your guy
Who loves what's beautiful, you know what I mean?
He's writing to a guy named Piso
And he says, hey
Hey, you're a good person, you know what I mean?
You want to know
You wouldn't want to be ignorant, you know
Unschooled in this kind of thing
But I want you to know, right?
They know how to mix these drugs
They're using the theriacs
Not just for the bites
But they're using them in the antidotes
Oh, God, give me the next one
You mean these christs are that steep
Into the drugs?
Yeah, yeah, I want to take you
Okay, wait, where is she?
I promised you I'd bring you her
This is Lady Babylon
Right, Lady Mystery
Go ahead, bring it up, Chewie
This is Lady Babylon
We have to bring it up
What's he doing here?
Get that junky Jesus out of here
Take your juice and get out of here
Go back with your boys
Back to the apostles, you creep
Okay, get him out of here
Run that Jesus off
That's what I do in Satanic congregation
Run off Jesus
They're going to catch up with him sometime
I'm warning you
We're going to catch up with him
All right, kids, if you're in a park late at night
And somehow you end up without your clothes on
Don't go to Jesus
Because he's going to get arrested
He's going to get arrested, right?
Okay, I'm not a trafficker
Bring it, bring it
Put that in, let's go
New material, these dogs are hungry
They want the new stuff
Watch what happens, people
Right?
Oh, God
Oh, God
You know how you can take these?
You can take these venom directly from the creature
Isn't that nice?
Directly
Or you can put them into a poma
You can put them into a potion
Oh, what kind of potion would that be?
I'm passing it out to everybody now
I want you to see this ancient potion
You know what it's called?
It's cyanic death
Black death
Everybody, welcome black death
Are you ready?
What kind of cult is this?
Don't worry
Trust me, the resurrection will be there
You'll all be born again, right?
Everybody that has ears can hear me
Go to the next one
Oh, love it
Where's her image?
You know what she is?
She's subtle
Who is this woman that he's looking for, Martha?
He's looking for the first Christ
For those of you who've just joined in
And we've got her, we captured her
She's here, it's fantastic
It's the fulfillment of everything
That the evangelicals have been waiting for
It's gorgeous
Where's the beast?
Love it, bring the next one
She's Wiley, notice who else was Wiley on that?
Notice who else?
Look, look, look
Calypso and Kierke
Boy, these daughters of the sun
These women are notorious
They are notorious, man
I kind of want to get caught
Have you ever found that way?
Have you ever been hunted?
And you're kind of like
I don't know, I sort of want to get caught
You know what I mean?
This is her
This is who we're looking for
Oh, God, did we not make it obvious enough?
Look, it's printed on this
Noggin, go, hit us a nut, yes
Oh, look at this, oh, oh, oh
This is the poem on May Day
This is why I brought you guys here
Don't worry about the form of May Day
We're going to, who is this?
We're going to jump into this doctor
Look, I'm going to be flashing you
Some of this doctor who works with Nero
And I'm going to be giving you the potion
Look at her, right in the face, right?
We've got Medea here, ready?
This is the priestess
We're looking at her, she's got her potion
Fantastic, and it's okumoran
That's not good, that's not good
It's that potion of black death
Are you ready? Are you ready for it?
Oh, we need to get some
Go, go, go, who is this?
Oh, who is this Bakant?
Who is this Bakant with the purple?
Who is she? I'm looking
Is she out there? This is fantastic
Go to the next one, Chewie
Bring us the, oh, we got to slide these sources
And faster people are going to be like
You know, I got to party somewhere
You know what I mean, right?
This, people, what are we doing tonight?
We're going to the dark harbor
We're going to the dark harbor, right?
If you have the galene
You don't have to worry
You're safe in the dark harbor
We're looking for Galene
That's who we're looking for, aren't we Chewie?
That's fine, give me the next reference
We're getting closer to her
Come here, shh, everybody quiet
Can you see her? I'm going to coax her in
Are you ready? Ok, the Greeks, right?
They use this thing called Helenion
Or Helenion, it's in the genitive here
What do they do with this thing?
It looks like the name for Greek
It looks like it's from the root
Hellenist, oh my God
What do they do with this stuff?
It's a drug, the Greeks have it
And they use it, I'm telling you what Galen
Just, he was telling me, go, go to the next one
Boom, and what does this thing do?
Oh, it's used by the Dacians
The Dalmatians, what do they do?
They put it on the tips of their arrows
All the arrow poison that we've been talking about
Galen is telling us who is doing it
And who is using it, so the stuff that was found
At the site, the henbane, jump on board people
Here it is, get the next one
What are they going to do with it?
What is she going to do with it most importantly?
Look at this, Ezekius, right?
Says it's the claymata, says it's what?
Says it's the clayma
And what is that?
It's the tendrils of the vine
Can you feel the tendrils of the vine?
If you don't, you don't have ears to hear
Oh, I see, this is some of the strange mystery
Called stuff, yes
So when they stop us at the door
And they ask you if you've got the tendrils
Tell them you do, tell them you do
Please, next source
That's how you get in people, right?
They're not going to let you in, otherwise
They're going to be putting crosses
You know why that guy's going to cross there?
Yeah, yeah, I do too
Fig leaves just don't cover enough
In some cases
Yeah, let's go, look at the skolia
This is a skolia of Nicander
Do you think for a minute
That there is a single evangelical out there
Who knows any of this?
And this is the stuff that's going on around Jesus
This is the language that he's growing up with
This is the language that he's speaking
Oh, God, love it, love it
Where's that Nicander?
We pulled him up, Nicander
Who is Nicander?
I'm going to introduce you to a priest
Priest of Apollo
In a minute, Nicander's going to give us
You know, because he knows all the drugs
We're searching for her
We're looking for her
Can we find her in this passage?
Oh, well, you know, it ends up being about Dionysus
Oh, guess what?
We get to join Dionysus
Why? Because Nicander
Thank you, Nicander, priest man
Wrote, now, people
Are these biblical times?
Are these biblical times?
No, this is history
This is an actuality
Biblical times are made up fairy tale
This is reality
This is Nicander
And what is Nicander saying here?
He wrote a book called the Ophiaca, right?
A book on serpents
Just on the venoms of the serpents
Can you imagine having that much knowledge?
You knew every friggin' snake and what it did
And what does he say here?
He says everybody knows that Dionysus
Was made insane by Hera
Whoo!
And there's a snake involved
Where's that serpent?
Yeah, you can go to the next one
Where's that serpent or whatever?
By the way, Chewie's packed this thing tonight
With a lot of symbols and a lot of stuff
That's gonna take you
If you have time, a little extra to look it up
And see what it is and what it means
It's all part of the cultiness, right?
Thank you, Chewie
Brilliant job done by Chewie
Where is that snake?
Where is that snake?
I want to see the snake
Oh, Hera drove him mad
Oh, there he is again
Jesus!
Wait, leave him in there
Now you brought him
Now you summoned him, Chewie
Blow him up so I can really look him right in the eyes
That snake handling
You wait until we get to the end of the day
We're gonna show you Jesus
With his, what does he command all Christians to do?
What does he command all the junky commands him to get high?
Jesus tells him, get high
I didn't know that was in the Bible
I'm gonna show it to you
I love it
Can you feel me there?
Can you feel me?
Sometimes you can feel just a little shiver
Yes, it's a side effect
Go, hit me the next one
The incubus flies
Did somebody turn the incubus on?
Get that thing out of here
Okay, what is this?
I want us to know this
Now this central figure of the mystery
That we're about to meet
She was from the great house of E.T.'s
The son of Helios
Oh, isn't that something?
Isn't that something?
And she was taught
You want to know what her pedigree is?
This is what this says
She was taught
Remember, she ends up being the Queen of Babylon, too
She was taught
By Hecate
She was taught by Hecate
Oh, who is that Hecate?
She was taught drugs
All of them, not just some of them
All of them
Oh, God
And look at that bottom line
What is she able to do with all of her knowledge?
What is she able to do with those drugs?
What is it when you take a woman
And give her a chance to go all the way to the top
To be the master of nature?
What happens?
She pulls down the stars
She redirects the moon
That's what happens
That's what happens
Where was Athena?
Athena wanted me to pop
I'm obliged by the power of Athena
She who guides and directs our democracy
I'm obliged when she shows up
To do what she tells me
And I'm doing so tonight
Under the order of she who established democracy
Right, she's got all the skills
She's got all the skills
Came right out of his head
Boom! Right out of God's head
Boom!
Yeah, shaking her spear
Love it
Give me the two at the end
We need those two quotes at the end
These are from Athena
Right, people are like
Don't do that
That gets my goat when people do that
And they say, you can't talk about modern stuff
Where's...
Yeah, no, my goat
No, no, we're off course
Quick, readjust the sensors
We're messed up
Oh, my God
Did we fly close to...
No, the last two quotes
Remember that I said
I'll know when to put them in
Yes, there you go, fantastic
Here we are
You and experts demand investigation
And it claims Israeli forces
Killed, raped and sexually assaulted
Palestinian women and girls
Give me another one
Give me the second one
She said, do them both
Ukraine, rape and torture by Russian forces
Continuing, writes experts report
Take that down
When you support
The rape of children
While holding up the banner
Of defending life
Your hands are stained with blood
Your hands are stained with blood
So says Nemesis
So says Nemesis
We cannot
We cannot join those forces
That cause people to rape children
Those armies
Those armies do not fight for democracy
No, they don't
They don't, justice to them all
Justice to them all
This is the lesson of Algeria in history
This was her lesson, she had a song
We ignored it, we buried the books
Ah, what a mistake
Why did they bury the books?
It was about the time of the uprisings
And they buried the books
Because they thought the people would revolt
If they heard what she said
She said, defend
Defend those children
Their voice is the voice of democracy
Thank you, Athena
For that immortal lesson from antiquity
Thank you, we bring
The past and the future into the present
Love it, love it
Okay, back to the cult
Everybody get back to the cult
They're like, why did it get so serious all of a sudden?
I was just having a good time
Okay, get back on your throne
Get back on your throne, it's okay
It's okay, do you feel a little bit culpable?
Let's go, let's go to the next source
We're looking for the Palma Medes
That's what we're looking for
We're looking for that drink
Palma Medes
We're looking for her medicine
Who's medicine?
Lady medicine
What they call her over in Italy
Angetia, snake queen
Woo, love it
Let's go, because when you know all the toxins, right?
You're not afraid of getting bit
Love it, go to the next one
Boom, yeah
What are we talking about?
What kind of creatures are we going to be using
In our art, right?
As you're entering this cult performance
What kind of creatures are you finding?
Echios, right?
From the Echis
Vipers, you should be thinking about vipers
Next one, we're going to go through these faster
What else is there?
Cantaridon, right?
Cantaris, what is that?
It's a beautiful blister beetle
And you take that thing and you have a sustained satiriasis
Nobody knows who that is
Look that up, what is satiriasis?
You have that sustained
Those are your drugs from Pan, right?
Who's using them?
The Medwa, right?
Lady medicine is using them
Oh, God, you mean it was a title?
I thought it was a name
That's what they say
Go to the next one, love it
What else?
What are the kind of snakes?
The ones that make you bleed
This is the name for the snake they came up with
That makes you hemorrhage blood, right?
Oh, my God, hit the next one
Boom, and you can do with some of this people
If you're in antiquity and in this cult
Don't knock these bowls over as we're walking around
Yeah, conium maculatum, right?
Isn't that what they killed Socrates with?
We think it's what they killed Socrates with, right?
That's our good hemlock
Hemlock's not just a drug to kill you with, right?
It's an active participant in a complex process
Of making a compound
Love it, and look, we're going to watch Gaylen tell us
This is so exciting, cute
Nobody knows this stuff, by the way
People, these are all sources that nobody cares about
Aconyta, too
What is it?
What is it?
Akinite, monk's hood
Yeah, wolf's pain
You know what they call this one?
Oh, God, this is so sexy
Are you ready?
Yeah, leave that Akinite up there
That's gorgeous
Look at the petals, wouldn't you just like to stroke those petals?
That's gorgeous
What do they cause, man?
Stuff can kill you, right?
It's a deadly, deadly poison, right?
Shut you down
It'll make your circuits go boop
You will be in the nether
Oh, God, look at the beauty and the power of nature
Look at her
Look at her, right?
That's what the lady medicine has to be
She has to be that nature
You mean she's taking this stuff?
Yep
Yep, she is
Oh, God, what does it do?
Just wait, go to the next one
What else do we have in here?
We've got Hioskai, the henbane
Look, people, look, this is what they just found
You know, I told you about the library
They were able to start reading, right?
They're going to find the very same types of works
that I'm giving you
from the doctors and from the magicians
from the magic
They're going to find astrology
They're going to find it only
They're going to find that drug
They're going to find that beautiful, beautiful drug
This is wonderful
This one makes you crazy, man
Don't do that one, kids
Don't do any of these, right?
Because it's mint
It's mint for somebody who has a high, high, high level
of expertise, right?
And Galen tells us that
He says, some of these doctors, they can't
They can't pull this stuff out
You can put this thing and make a tea with it
and it's not going to hurt you
But if you have the right knowledge
of where on the plant to collect it
and how to make it into a compound
how to synthesize it, he says
Oh, my God, these theriacs, they're crazy
Crazy, did you know?
We are in the drug dark ages
ruled by barons of the economy
Yeah, by barons
And our drug knowledge isn't a one-hundredth
of what theirs was
Oh, my God, the complex systems there
You talk to a modern pharmacologist
and you ask him, what happens
when you put all of these things together
and you do this with them
And I don't know
Right
Is this the dark ages?
Yeah, we went back, didn't we?
Where's the classical sunrise?
Let's bring it, go
Boom, what else?
Opium
Opium, you've got to have your opium
Everybody out there
All the hop heads, hello
Hello to the hop heads, right?
This isn't your acetylated morphine
Right, but it's the raw stuff
that'll get you there, right?
Yeah, yeah, here it is
If you wondered why your dark goddess
was calling you
Oh, the empire got us in the track to be in there
Sorry about that, people
Yeah, it's okay
Let's go back to it
Where were we?
We were with a bunch of people using drugs
in the ancient world
and somehow Jesus was there with the snakes
Right?
Oh, my God
Jesus and the snakes?
Yeah, let's look at her one more time
Let's look at the woman
who came up with all of this
that spun off Judaism
that spun off Christianity
Oh, let's find her
Let's find her, go
Go to the next source
Oh, yeah
Look at this one, people
Yeah, this is the dark harbor
That's in the room
We've already been there
We're just people
You've got to remember
We're in the dark harbor
And you're not going to understand that
unless you've seen it
That's okay
We'll get them
Don't worry
We're still broadcasting, right?
We still have coverage
We're still, right?
The shields are still out, people
Let's keep going
Hit us with the next one
Yeah, there we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
Next one, yeah
There we go
And what does this stuff do to you, people?
Down below
If you look at what her communion does
It opens up your eyes
Wait, what?
Yeah
It gives you vision
It gives you vision
Because your eyes
Your eyes ain't open
They're blurred
You have embliopia
Your eyes
Are not open
Have you come here tonight
And you're like, what is this?
And you want your eyes opened
You got to go see the serpent
You got to go see the serpent
It turns out Yahoo's a big liar
Yeah, he made a debacle of the whole deal
Right, he took a Bronze Age thing
And just screwed it up
That's what happens when you're outsourced, baby
Let's go mainstream
Right through the Saturnian
Right into the Satanic
And bring it up
Open your eyes, people
What do you think this medicine does?
It opens your eyes
Hit us with the oh
And by the way, it's also good
For that craziness
This stuff makes you crazy, right?
Don't get me wrong
We've seen that before
But look what it does
It also cures rabies
You mean you can bring somebody
Through rabies on this stuff?
Yeah
That's how the physicians are using it
Oh, you didn't think of that one, did you, Doc?
No, you didn't
Good, and by the way
Look at that last word there
Antidotoy
It is the antidote, baby
And it smells like wonderland
It smells like wonderland
You have an antidote
It smells like wonderland
That's odd
Remember, we're fumigating people
We're fumigating
Didn't you?
You forgot when you came here
We had the fumigation going
You're breathing that stuff in
You're starting to purge now
The reality has hit you
Now you're getting a little bit of paranoia
A little bit of paranoia
It's starting to come up
I think it's going to get worse
You can use this as a treatment
For rabies
And the mania that comes from rabies
I love it
Let's go to the next one
Probably some chemicals in the brain stuff
You can even calm a titanic seizure
Yeah, a titanic fit
Tetanus, right?
They had to deal with it
And this is one of the medicines they used
I told you we were going to Lady Medicine, right?
I showed you the purple that she uses
That cures growths
This is it
This is it
Let's keep going
One more
Boom, boom
When are we all going to do this?
Says the physician
They do it
In the dawn
Yeah, you do it in the dawn
What time do you think it was?
What time do you think it was?
It was during the dawn, right?
We were dawn bringers
Let's go down
You didn't think we made up that stuff
About dawn bringers for nothing, did you?
Don't ever meet a
You'll never meet a resurrected vampire
Who's not a dawn bringer
A dawn bringer, right?
Jesus Christ himself
Right, you Christians, wake up, man
He's a dawn bringer
You mean he's using this stuff?
Where is he?
Bring up Jesus with his snakes again
Jesus
Yoo-hoo
Jesus, maybe if I do this kind of stuff
Come on
You'd like it
Where is he?
Chewie
Chewie
Oh, thank you
Fantastic
Remember, I told you
He's right in the middle of this stuff
And you've never seen this Jesus
I mean, we've been sniffing around him, right?
But you hadn't seen him before that
You hadn't seen that reality
Your vision has opened up
The blurriness that's in your eyes
Has been rubbed away
Those scales
You're healed
How are you healed?
You're healed with reality
Knowing yourself is a healing process
Right?
Who are we?
Who are we?
And that's why sometimes you've got to look in the mirror
And say, am I culpable?
When I see that armies overseas
Are raping children
Am I somehow culpable?
If I not stood against armies of rapists
Look, baby, this is Rome
This is Rome
This is exactly why Judea
And all of Greece were pacified
Yeah, they were volunteering by the end of
They were volunteering kingdoms to Rome
Because Romans don't put up with the lace-dace, man
Romans don't put up with the child traffickers
Those who do things to children
That's why they started arresting Christians
Because the Christians were performing ritual incestuous acts
A.k.a. adult women were sodomizing boys
Interesting, interesting
That's a strange thing to do
Yeah, there's a lot of chemistry involved
And there's a lot of anthropology
So let's hang up
Was that creepy, Jesus?
Oh, I didn't see him
Oh, I'm glad I didn't see him
That guy gives me a bad feeling
Let's go to the next text, people
We're only going to have a few more of these
Because tonight I don't want to keep you that long
And I wanted to give you something sweet
Like the sweetest nectar I could give you
What else are we going to put in this concoction?
We're going to put that nard
Just like Mary Magdalene had
And you can get this stuff
You can get this stuff from a Celtic dude
Some Galatian
Wait a minute
Are we in Bithynia or are we in Etruria?
Yes
The answer is yes
You mean we're all the way over in Italy
And at the same time all the way over in the Black Sea?
Yes
Why do you think they build temples too in Italy?
Right?
Right?
Those are Tyrenians
Those are Etruscans
You want to talk about a people
You mean there are Etruscans in Asia Minor?
Is Asia Minor off the coast of the Black Sea?
Isn't she beautiful?
Look at that finger coming down in the carousel
Right?
Look at that finger
Oh God, you know what that is?
That's where she lives
That's where she lives
Everybody that's along this coast
Look at the western coast of Turkey
Right?
This is Asia Minor in antiquity
Right?
There's no Turkey then
This is Asia Minor
And who?
Who are the people all along the coast?
They're Ionian Greeks
Ionian Greeks
Yeah
And those people who are up on the Black Sea
Just up on the north there
Those people in those tribes
They're the ones who have the sophistication with the drugs
They make us look like we're going backwards
It's not amazing
They have a connection with the Greeks
They are spreading
Their people are spreading
What do they call those Aryans?
Well, now they call them Meads
Yeah
Yeah, they do
Look, dude, they were all on horseback
You gotta give them a break
You gotta give them a break
I want to say something, by the way
I want to take that down for a second
And I want to just say
We've never kicked anybody out of the chat room
Not even
I was tempted a couple of times
With some misogynistic stuff
Because there's absolutely nothing productive
It's only control that can come of that
Right?
And we don't want
We don't want any of that
Any of those invaders
Right?
But I let everybody speak
But Chewie got a little bit excited
And blasted somebody
Yeah, so
Goodbye
Goodbye
No more warnings
We don't have to warn anymore
Sit down
Be quiet
Right?
Because somebody stepped over the line
How do you step over the line
In the Satanic congregation?
Number one, you're dishonest
If you are dishonest
And you say things that aren't true
You got no place with Saturn, baby
The Saturnian age doesn't accept pollution
Right?
Pollution gets purged
So you angered Chewie
And Chewie pulled out his blaster
And off you went
Love it
Love it
Let's keep the people here
Hell Satan
Everybody out there
Hell Satan
I'm going to get to your comments tonight
Okay, I want to purify us again
Because I want to take what I've shown you
And I want you to feed it in
To this chorus
This Orphic chorus
Along with its images
Chewie hit us with Medea again
Dream with Athena
I grew up in the house of Satan
You're going to have to make a better opera
I'm on this hot track
With a stuffy like Medea
The Sorceress
Hold the ghost home to your faces
With drugs it's laced
I'm in the tree line
In the Gagore
Company and Whopper
House up on the hill
Putting Lightning on you
Lawnmower man
Pop purple drawers
Direct with straws
Boys in arrows
Dealing the tarot cards
Dancing to the bank
The water flows just to rip this edge
This little chicka-dee I know
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Poison arrows
Black out the sky
Poison arrows
Dream time
Dancing to the bank
Crow and weed in the graveyard
Starks big as Mount Everest
Put the tattoos on your head
Phosphorus, light bearer
Cathode, black goo
She's coming for you
Iambic pentameter
On the bark of legs
Exclaim the pattern
It is what I am
Hail Satan
Sombrero hats off
Don't be late
The wizard walks by
With a pointy hat
And a purple cane
You have asphalt on
I cannot take you
I have to take you there
This is the intimate of the intimate
This is the inner chamber baby
And that's where we go
What did you think this was all about?
That inner chamber
That antrum? That's it
That's where she is
That's where you'll find
Lady Medea
Go to the next one
Boom
Excellent
There it is
Okay, people, look at this really quick
Who are we? Who's our sponsor tonight?
In all of this activity
Oh, there we are
It hurts every time you do that
It's like a dimensional shift
Stop it, Chewie
Look at the end of the first line, people
We're looking at Pion
Who is Pion?
Well, here he's given specific
kind of
epithets, right?
He's given very specific
We can see him, emerge
This is the great physician
What am I rambling about?
The great physician
Don't you remember when Jesus is all walking around
Heal people, casting out demons
Stuff like that
Being the great physician
This is who we're addressing
This comes from Medea's work
In the late Bronze Age
Yes, the divine physician
You Boneheads was first
A woman
Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine worshipping
A divine physician woman?
Oh, God
Where is she?
I want that, right?
Where is she? Bring her back
Bring her back, love it
Hit us with the next source, please
Chewie, got a little
He gave me, hit my head last time
On the top of the screen
Okay, look people, I just want to bring up
Nicander, and I want to show you a couple
of things from this priest
Look at this, look at the, look at
On the fourth line, Lexia
He says, look brother, he's talking about
He's basically writing
A poetic letter to a friend
Of his, right? And he's writing
It in meter
I mean, this guy is
Genius, and his work ultimately
Becomes the basis for
Much of the science of
Rome, right?
They're all stealing from him
Cicero is stealing from him, right?
Quoting him plenty, stuff like that
And what does he call it? He says, look, I can
I know, he's living
In that western coast
Turkey, you know
Asia Minor, he's living there
And what is he doing?
He says, look, I've got your curatives
I know
What the antidotes are
For the drugs that people are using
In ceremonies, right? We've got him
And he starts to go through a list
But he says, look, this is going to take you to a place
This is going to take you to a place
From which you're not going to come back
It's the chasm
It's the rift of Eubulius
Wait, what?
It's the rift of Eubulius
You're listening to a priest
Talk about
Entering people into the right
This is a place
That you're going to go
To everybody who's under the influence
Right now, that you're watching
In the room
They're going to the chasm
Of Eubulius
Yeah
Yeah, fantastic
Hit us with the next one
What are we going to do, people
If we're able to get out
You can't escape
The place
Except
With the Alexifonmicon
What is that thing? It's an antidote
Look at number two here
See where it says, look at the pharmacon
It's a way to describe the pharmacon
That's what he's doing
When I say
That Jesus Christ is involved
You blow it up
This is disturbing, I have to tell people this
I keep saying in interviews
And I've got a couple of
I've had some good interviews
And I've got a couple more coming up
So when you tell
These people that Christ
Is a pharmacological term
And that Christianity
Is a
Cult right
Of a mystery that is using
Drugs
They look at you funny
Because they're coming to us from
La La Land
This is wonderland to them
This is the fairy tale
This is Jesus with his little
You know, his entourage
Of 35 year old white men
With beards
Yeah
This is that fairy tale
That their mind
Is consumed with
The scales over their eyes
Turn them into a horde
That wants to kill children
While raising flags
That say, we're the protecting the children
Yeah
And then they're killing them
That blood
Soaked into that eye
That will take off those scales, man
You'll see who you are
Do you know what the Bacchic initiation
Does?
It shows you who you are
It's a mirror
It's a mirror people
I want you to remember that
Everybody in satanic initiation
That Bacchic initiation
Is a mirror
We are still
Honoring Apollo
We are still honoring
He who strikes from afar
He who carries the arrows
Did you wonder why Jesus Christ
Riding into the apocalypse
Is on a horse and has arrows
Did you wonder that?
I am showing you
Eden
I'm showing you where that came from
And it came from a woman
It came from a woman
I love it
Do you see her?
She's a little bit afraid
She's got a cup for you
She's got a cup
Let's go to the next one
Poison me baby
That's what I'm saying
Poison me baby
Give me the next one
You people are the same
Don't look at me and say shame on you
Shame on you
There's no shame
Keep going to the next one
These are just words that are related
These drugs
And remember Galen told us
They're not just making antidotes
For the poisons
They're using the poisons
In their
Theriacs
Isn't that genius?
You take a poison
And you turn it
Into the water of life
And you do it through a person
A very special person
Right?
That mother of medicine
Has to be
We've got to go to her dark harbor
Are you ready to go to her dark harbor?
And everybody just
I know 30% of you just put up your hands
You're like wait
Wait wait
No no no this is a cruise
You can't jump now
You're already there
That reality has already opened up
Sorry you can't ignore it now
I know you want to go back
But you can't go to the next one
Go to the next one let's finish off
Look at these people
What is this thing?
What is this thing that they're preparing?
It's the lady killer
It's the lady killer
Well who's going to use something called
Lady killer
I mean wolf killer I understand
Right? Lady killer
What's the lady killer all about?
Tell me
A man who is not a cretin
Because everybody knows
From her
Creitins are all liars
They gave her second place in the beauty contest
Right?
Do you see what happens?
Don't be a cretin
Don't be a cretin
Find that
Source
And when you do you'll
Declare her the most beautiful
Go to the next one
What kind of mesmerism is this?
It's the sources baby
What does plenty tell us about
The lady killer
Look
This is what the report says
Plenty right?
When you apply this thing
To the female genitalia
It induces
Mortem
It induces death
Do you see
Where you have to go
With these mystery cults
It's always
Always right into death
Why do you think there's a rebirth
Yeah
It has to be
On the genitalia
That is the biological
Source
Now I'm going to show you something
And I know
People I know
Who's the dirty dirty person
Out there
Who is the dirty person
Who wants to see to the bottom
Of that well
Who wants to see to the bottom
Of this source
Right?
Who wants to see
To the bottom
Show me
Show me
The bottom
Right?
Here's the bottom
Oh God
What are we going to see here
The last word on the first line
Is galactos
You'll recognize galaxy in that
Perhaps
Our Milky Way galaxy is called the Milky Way
Because
Galactos means milk
And
What is that?
Oh, poloio
Oh no
What is a poloio
That's the word
For the
Not through
Growing stage yet
Of the person
Or they use it also for
Any kind of animal
But it's the phase of not being done yet
With puberty
And what do you do with this person
You take their milk
And
You add drugs
To this water
Because it doesn't look like
Regular milk
But
You take it
And you add it
To balsamum
And
It's one of the ingredients
That will balance
We call it galane
The whole composition
But you have to have
That
Exodate
From that priestess
Okay
I told you about
What they call the maidens milk
I told you
Right
Now you're seeing it
It is again another component
It is what the medwa
Brings
Right
And it's why one person
Can be classified
As a nymph
Never ages
Have you ever seen her age
No, how old is she
About 13
12
Ish
She's awfully big for that age
And guess what
We're all afraid of her
This is her image
Medwa
Love it
People are like
We need the new
Just go hit
Anyone
Fantasics
This is theophrastus
Christians would never
Be interested in
Aristotle
Plants
Aconite
Aconite
It is on Crete
With all those liars
And it isn't Zakenthus
But the best of it
Aristotle
Is in Heraclea
In the Pontus
This is Pontic
Pontic Aconite
That's the best stuff
Theophrastus has already told us that
He's a student of Aristotle
Now here's what's cool
Give me the next one from that
It says
Oh, look, oh here
This one just butted in
What did you say in the candor
Look at that first line
Hey, those of you who want to know
Here's the formula
Here is the divine communion
I'm showing it to you people
Look at the first line
The last word
The circle
This is the fire of Medea
Colchian Medea
When she comes
When Lady Babylon comes
With that cup
That's when you know Christians
Put your mark on
Put your mark on your head
He's not going to take you
It's just the way it is
It's in the text, baby
Let's bring up Jesus
We need Jesus
It's 758
In my zone
We need Jesus
All the way down to Jesus, please
Yeah, this is Matthew
And what was that? This stuff was all
Supposed to be fulfilled by the prophets
Those people
Who were on the drugs in the first place
Right?
This guy's going to cause us to
He's going to heal us
And he's going to cause us to
Not have any sort of illness, right?
Right? What is this guy going to do?
Right?
Go, go to the next one
He's going to tell us
Hey, whoever believes and is baptized
Is going to be saved
And those who don't
They're going to be judged
That's him, right out of the mouth of Jesus
Thank you Jesus
Now tell us, what do you mean? Who are the Christians?
And who are not now?
And I'm issuing a challenge
To those of you who watch
To the sisters of frustration
To those of you who watch because
You secretly wear those monks
Underwear
I want you to see what a real
Christian is. Are you ready?
And all you dogs in the congregation
All you wolves out there
Keep barking baby
Keep barking because this is it
Go to the next one
Who is that Christian?
Yeah, there are certain characteristics
Right?
What are these people going to do?
They're going to cast out demons
They're going to cast out demons in my name
And they're going to what?
They're going to speak in these
New languages, right?
Because you haven't heard this stuff
You mean is that tongues?
Yeah, yeah it is
And tongues is not a current
Written language? Nope
Nope, it's not
And what else
Marks these Christians?
What else do Christians do?
When you go to your church this weekend
And you're standing there
In the general church
Waving to invisible Jesus
Right and praising
You got your hand out
And people are swaying
Yeah and oh we love you Jesus
Do you do this?
Because if you don't, you're not a Christian
Go to the next one
What is it? Oh my god
You're going to raise up serpents
And you're going to drink
Thanassimon
Thanassimon is the word
That I keep saying
On the medical side that is
Those poisonous concoctions
That are meant within the mystery
To put you into a state of death
And bring you out
Into new life
You'll be able to do that
If you are a Christian
Those of you who are sitting there
Your faith is meaningless
Your faith is meaningless
If you are not raising up serpents
If you are not
Taking
A communion
That is a death bringer
You're not a Christian
And you're not doing it at dawn
And it's probably why
You are a member of the sisters of frustration
Your faith is meaningless
Says Jesus Christ
Right
What does the devil insist on?
Honesty
Honesty
You want this don't you
You want it
Go to the next one
And then I want to yell at the crowd
That was it, pull me up
It gets my goat that we
I kept people for so long
It gets my goat, hail Penelope
We love you Penelope
She's so gorgeous
I love her godiness
Now I'm going to give you an opportunity
Because we just have a couple of minutes
And I'm going to play us out with
Our exit
I want to ask people in the audience
Because I want people to know
I want people to know that I'm paying attention
I go back and I read your comments
I read your comments
Chewie are there any outstanding comments

That's why we're all here we all know it
We all wanted to see Jesus get arrested
With a naked boy
Isn't that amazing

Jesus Christ arrested with a naked boy

But enjoy it
Love it and I love that stuff

I wanted you to really see
Tonight those concrete texts
So that you can have
An understanding
So that you can see
The Jesus Christ who is walking
In antiquity and you can bring him
Forward and you can
See the Jesus Christ
Who is out there now
And you know
Unless we're gonna really
Piss off the queen
Of democracy
That Athena
I think we should start paying attention
To the blood
Yeah let's protect those
Vestals those things
That are
In a place that they can grow
And blossom
Let's protect those things in life
That's the side that we should be on
Right otherwise you know
The watchers can only take so much
They can only take so much
The nemesis kicks everybody out
Thank you for coming tonight
I hope
That you have begun
To see
With the eyes
That the great physician
Can give us
Hail Satan
Sexy time witches
Ones with poisonous kisses
Ones with poisonous kisses
Cause I wreak like in the cup
Cause I wreak like in the cup
With the glowing chalice
Of dragon bender
Singing songs written on seashells
Fleece, tree sap and mushrooms
Coming through
Hail the sexy time witches
Hail the sexy time witches
Ones with poisonous kisses
Ones with poisonous kisses
Hail the sexy time witches
Ones with poisonous kisses
Ones with poisonous kisses
