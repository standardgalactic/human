Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burned through my veins
Indian goes crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've got your selling and you got your drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah, drinkin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation
It's good to see everyone
Tonight we have a little update on some music that will be coming our way
Some music and an artist, lovely stuff
But we are going to dive into the deep tonight
I'm sorry, I'm going to be talking about a lot more drugs
You mean they can have more drugs than the ones that we've already looked at? Yes
And we're going to be following that thorn
That thorn that sinks deep into the flesh
We're going to look for those seven stars tonight on Lady Babylon
Thanks for joining us tonight, I know your time is valuable
So I'm going to absolutely put the pedal to the metal
The ship is set, we are going back to that first century
But before we get there, we're going to stop
Does anybody mind? Does anybody mind?
We're going to stop, make a stop
See some of the mid-19th
Pull out a little bit of Jules Michelet
Jules Michelet, French historian
French historian, he coined a word
He coined a word, what was that Jules?
Renaissance, gorgeous, gorgeous
You finally find the right people
You know what I mean? It's always those who are coining words
Those are the dragons, yeah, those are the dragons
Tonight we're going to have a two-part clip to start us off here to get us into the mood
This is Jules Michelet
Be careful, the punch is spiked with aphrodisiacs
I want you to be looking for them, look for them tonight
Look for the aphrodisiacs who run around
Maniacally, I want us to see them
Oh, they're people, love it
Let's start this first clip, and I want you to
Just enjoy, just enjoy, if you can
Please, this one's on us, Jules, go ahead
Jules Michelet
Jules Michelet
Jules Michelet
Jules Michelet
And the dragon pursues that song
Protects and guards it
Only to be put to sleep
By her hand
I want to find that paradise, don't you?
Don't you, I want to go back, does it just
I want to let everybody know
I want to let you in on a little secret
Those rivers
Those four rivers
That leave paradise
They bound it
And that location, that location
Is as plain as day
It's as plain as day, look to the fossils
You'll find, you'll find her there
With the dragon
In paradise
Who was it, where's that junkie?
Get that junkie Paul, people by the way love
Working with junkie Paul, so let's get him down
Here's my whip, come on Paul, come on
Yeah, it's a don't, down, he looks so sad
He looks so sad, I think I'm beating him too much
Paul, tell me, Paul the apostle
Holy Paul, can I call you Holy Paul?
Tell me, what are your people looking for?
You're looking for that third uranos
You're looking for that third uranos
And tell me Paul, do you remember how you got there?
Everybody that was with us, it was on the ride
We're going back, right? This is warp speed
Oh my God
We're going back to that point in time
Yeah, here we are, we're in that third heaven
Right, okay, everybody's got the throne
Is everybody sitting on the throne?
Those of you with ears to hear will know
You must be sitting on the throne
What comes from the throne?
That's what we're going to see in the end today
We looked at the Mithraic energy
We saw her, we saw her being put through it
Can you smell the kufi?
Smell that kufi, love it, love it
Tonight, let's keep going
Let's go a little bit deeper and drive that thorn into the flesh
A little bit deeper, let's go back to it
Hit those first of those texts that we've got up there
Tomusterion Tomhapterasteron
Who's elis epites dexiasmu
Gorgeous, gorgeous
This is the mystery of those seven stars
Which you see in my right hand
Which you see in my right hand
Are we with that girl?
Are we with her being put through that initiation?
Let's go to the second one
Ho hepte haste des angeloiton hepte ecclesiones
See, who are these people?
Who are these angeloi?
They say, wait a minute, she had seven stars in her hand
She had seven stars in her hand
Right, I am a wandering star, she says
Oh, fantastic
Here they are
They're messengers, they're angeloi
Paul's got one
That's why I told you to throw away those magic books
Paul has his own thorn
Paul's got his own thorn
What do you do with a thorn?
Well, if you study ancient medicine
You know that you're in a world
You're in a world of psychotropics
You're in a world where neurochemistry is the motto
Yes, fantastic
Let's go to the very, this one right about here
Here we go, no, this one
Perfect, perfect, look at this people
This is what you gotta get is a skullops
You gotta get a skullops, right?
And I blew this up, I brought this to you guys last time
But this is what you gotta get
What is a skullops, right?
It's a thorn
Or look at this, underneath the entry for the scorn
We got the skullopis foinicos
Yeah, what is that?
What is the foinics?
What is the foinics?
The foinics is the purple
The foinics is the purple
We've got thorns purple
Yeah, what are we gonna do?
Go back to that thorns purple place
Yeah, watch what's happening people here
Notice we've got that reference to our Corinthians
Right, second Corinthians, right
Notice in number three it's an instrument for operating on Eurythra
Right, fantastic, it's the point of a fishing hook
Yes, yes
So what is Paul's skullops?
It's an instrument that is used to drive the purple into the body
Into the body, why?
Because they know you can't drink it
It doesn't work the same, fantastic
You need that skullops
Yeah, now what did Paul call his?
Come here, come here, right?
Some of you just wanted me to hurt St. Paul the Apostle gratuitously
Those of you who have given me those comments
You should be ashamed of yourself
However, I will indulge you
Oh yeah, oh right on his little bottom
Oh, like that, like that
Do you like that?
I do, St. Paul's buttocks is bruised
He's been smelling angels' middle fingers too much
What do we do in all seriousness?
What do we do with the thorn?
Paul, what does it do for you?
That sting, that sting is an angelos
Wait, wait, what?
The sting is an angelos
I can use this thing and get messages
I can get messages
You can, you can
Has anybody read the apocalypse lately?
By the way, I'm taking all the stuff from the apocalypse
These are all texts, this is your Bible
Because we're storming, we're storming your Bible college
We just stormed into a Bible college
We kicked the doors down
We stripped naked, every professor there and lined them up
We walked in, we took their Greek texts
We said, these are our chumps and we walked out with it
They belong to us now
They belong to us
Your hoo-ha is just that
It's hoo-ha
It goes for seminaries
It goes for universities, big and small
Private liberal college
Liberal private university
St. So-and-so, it doesn't matter, it's all of you
It's all of you
You've let us down
So we're taking the texts back
And we're gonna, we're gonna work on them ourselves
Yeah, we're gonna work on them ourselves
Let's go back
We're at the scabs
It's an angel of who?
It's an angel of Satan
Do you just keep us here?
It's an angel of Satan
Satan, it doesn't say it
It's an angel of Satan
Because it's the form of the word
Oh, it doesn't say
It says it is Satan
Oh, do you like that?
Do you like that?
You thought, you thought you understood the universe
You were living in
You thought you knew who the devil was, didn't you?
Didn't you know?
No, no, no, no
Thank you, Sebesius, man
Holy mackerel
This is wonderful
This is wonderful
Let's go back to the Greek
Let's keep going
Let's dive, let's get deeper
Paul's got this messenger thing
Just don't forget, take it down
Just don't forget
Paul's got a messenger
He's got an applicator
That will take him to the third uranos
And when he's there
Bum, bum, he gets the visions
He gets the visions
Yeah, yeah
And what is the voice in his head?
Satan, bro
Did you know Paul the Apostle had Satan in his brain?
That's too much
You didn't
Because you have lived in Disneyland all your life
And you follow fairy tales
And you have buildings where you walk into the buildings
And they repeat the fairy tales
And they give you some this and some that
And none of it is the Christian mystery
None of it, I can tell you for a fact
Take it, take it from the board
The board of Lucifer and Co
Yeah, the mystery is not being performed
Do you want to know what it is?
That guy that was jacking himself with purple?
Yeah, he knew, he'd been there
He'd seen the things that can't be repeated
With mortal speech
With mortal tongue
Things that can't be repeated
Yeah, he'd seen them
And he knew
He knew, let's dial him back up here
We've got to get some more Greek in here before these people get bored
Right?
Yeah, what's he going to do?
He's going to go to that paradise here
We'll see that Padaeus on there
Oh, that says, I'm not making it up folks
It's right there in your text
He's getting the areta remata
Right, the things that can't be repeated
Those not just newspaper clippings
Or not just headlines
Or not just ancient scroll labels
None of that
None of that, this is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
He is snatched away via his burning purple
Isn't that nice?
Love it, oh god, the drugs are getting
Wait, there's more, there's more drugs to come
We need more drugs than this?
Yes, we do
If we're going to have the apocalypse
We need a lot of drugs, sorry
Let's bring up the next one, yeah
So what was given to him was a skullops
And that is his Angelo satana
Okay Paul, keep Satan in your head
And let's keep going
Look at this, this is from the Mithras Liturgy
I just want you guys to look at the third line down
This is 575, like that
Yeah, sige, sige, sige, right?
That's your log off that you're supposed to speak
Ego, Amy, sum planos, sum min astir
I am the wandering star with you
With you, she's addressing those seven
Keep your eyes on those seven stars
Your anchor is that fugater
That daughter who is in the Mithrait
Right, that's your key
Keep your eye on her, right?
Because what is she going to do?
Kai ek dubafus an alampon
Because she's going to come out
She's going to, what does it say?
Turn it off, she's going to
come out
She's going to return
She's going to return from where?
From the depths, from the depths, bro
Now you don't know where that is, right?
You don't know where that is
Because we're talking about dimensions
We're talking about the seen and the unseen, right?
Okay, evangelicals, you guys should have been
saying, yep, yep, we know, we know
That's the way to, do you know what happened?
I put Paul with Isaiah, the next thing
Isaiah had a big smile on his face
I don't know what's going on
I don't know, but you got to keep those
You got to keep that from turning into something
You know, where it gets out of hand, right?
Excellent, let's go, let's go to the next
Hey, right here under that text
I just want to give you a few words here
Yeah, can we blow that up? Fantastic
So I can get to, oh, this is burning, man
Look at this, this is what's going on
In the eyes of Jesus
In the eyes of Jesus
He touched me, he touched me, right?
Oh, he touched me, right?
Show me where he touched you on the dolly, right?
Jesus touched me with his burning eyes
He's got flocks poor in his eyes
Does everybody here realize that?
The risen, the risen, take it down for just one minute
The risen vampire Jesus, right?
He who was dead, he who became necros
He is the living flame
He has the flocks in his eyes
He has the flocks in his eyes
Okay, right there, right in front of him
Right in front of him, bringing him right to you
Are you there in the right?
Okay, you're going to hold on
You're going to get a little turbulent here
Bring this up, make me bigger
Well, notice that it means to light up, right?
To light up, to burn or blaze
As in a torch, and then at the very bottom
You see, it's used to passion
It's used to passion
Is there a connection between this flocks
And the stuff that we gave you in your drink
When you were coming in tonight
Is there something different?
Is there something?
Nope, it's the same thing, it burns
It burns, ask any physician
Any physician around town, you know
Let's go to Rome
Let's take a side trip to Rome, guys
And let's step out in the first century
Let's ask a physician in Rome
Hey, bro, does it burn?
And he says, what do you think they call it?
The burning purple idiot
And you say, okay, can you tell me something
About why that is?
Great, ancient physician
That's because the heat
That's because the what, the heat
The heat of what?
The burning seed, brah
You got the heat of the burning seed
That causes you to thirst, right?
Ooh, what happens when you thirst?
You get a lot to drink
Yeah, yeah, these druggies, I tell you
I tell you, you people
I mean, this is again, again
When I say you people, I'm not talking about
The congregation of Satan, right?
I'm not talking about those
Those of you who worship the muse
I'm not talking about those
I'm talking about everyone
That those watchers talk about
Yeah, and I'm thinking how do they get to the point
Where their cult creates their society
And the one that is dominant
Is the one that started
With sex and sex drugs
Yeah, sex and sex drugs, man
Yeah, that's what the Christian foundation is all about
Sex and sex drugs
It's why they're forcefully raping children, right?
Purification, brah
It's a Christian purification
And from that, you can get the golden vessel
Love it
You want to be born again, Tommy?
You want to be born again?
I know your parents aren't here
I know your parents aren't here, Tommy
Yeah
You ever see the devil, Tommy?
Yeah
Christianity
Thank you
Thank you Christianity for these
Roots of our history
And now you know why the watchers
You know, now you know why
They wear the colors that they wear
It's just too late
They already put on heavy gear
Right?
Okay, back to Sodom and Gomorrah
Let's go, where's the fantastic
Look at this, a flame of fire
Fire is the element, what is that flux, right?
Well, it comes from that burning
It comes from that shining, right?
And you've got it as an element of nature
It's a very element of nature
That's what burns in Jesus' eyes
Right, the flux, ros
Let's go to that one, yep, let's see that one
Oh, we've already seen that, we don't need that
Let's go down to the death
That's the death, yeah
You know, write this to that, you know, to that church
To the angel that's over the church in Smyrna
Yeah, because that angelos, we all know, right?
Remember Paul's got his angelos
He's got his
And these churches have theirs
Did you think you were going to get into the cult?
You knew you would, right?
It's gorgeous
Okay, so let's keep going
What are we supposed to say to these people at Smyrna?
Remember, we're getting our visions, right?
This is all visions, John is having visions
He's taking into the Eremon, right?
And I'll show you in just a second, but here
And yeah, to that angelos in Smyrna, you know, write these things
The first in the completion is talking to you, right?
The one who became dead and flamed out
That's actually an heiress, isn't that funny?
People want to translate, this came to life
Because it fits, it fits the fairy tale
Ryan, where's Mr. Rogers when you need him?
This is gorgeous, this is gorgeous
You guys, I'm telling you, New Testament scholars
Can I just take a step back today
And say New Testament scholars out there
You guys at the seminaries
Dude, you have done such a poor job
You didn't even thank for a minute
Hey, if I want to understand this one document
Maybe I should read everything else around it
Maybe I should know how words develop over time in Greek
Right? No, that's not what you did
It's not what you did
Clot, you lousy, lousy, shoddy stuff
That's what brings, you know, that's why we have to have that whole apocalypse thing
Guardians let down
Let's go to the next one
Yeah, look at this, here's the...
Look, you can have this same root for that
One that means to live or to burn
And you can have it to bring something to life
Look at this, the Therion
Zothentosoma
Yeah, that Theriac, the beast
Right?
Bringing back, bringing back, producing
Hmm, interesting
Yeah, makes me smell Aphrodite
All of this purple drug use
Makes me smell Aphrodite
Never forget, that's where we are
Okay, next text, we've got a couple more
We've got a gift
I just wanted you guys to see the Aphrodite
Right, look at how they translate it
These are the people who are on the Aphrodisiacs, right?
In plural, it's the worshippers of Aphrodite at Rhodes, right?
Oh, the lessee of a public brothel
So, when somebody tells you that cup of porneas is waiting for us
Yeah, you see?
Don't do that
Don't do that
Don't...
They think it means to offer flesh to idols
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
They think it means to offer
To eat meat offered to stones
They don't realize
Right? How could they?
You guys coated this stuff up too much
Right?
We've got to go back to the great people to make sense of it
And when you do, it's shocking
What's the next one on there?
Give me the next one
Look at this, this is just zaho, right?
Oh, just drink some of this in
Just drink it in
To be burnt alive
Woo, that's something
Okay, let's go on
And to that angel
Yeah, that's in Thyatira, the church at Thyatira
Write these things
Say, Ho huyos tu feyu
The son of God
Ho egon tu saftal mus
Au tu
Who has his eyes as what?
Hos floga puros
As that flocks of fire
And he's got those feet
Those calcolibanic feet
And you say, what does he have?
Net mean, net mean he has brand's feet
Ha ha ha
Yeah, no, it's bad
I shouldn't laugh, don't do that
It shouldn't laugh
It's not funny when you desecrate the temple
It's not funny
Okay, let's keep going
Let's keep going
Yeah
And to that guy
You know, he's got the, we're done with him
Yeah, whoever knows the deep things
Ba tha tu satana
Do you know the deep things of Satan?
Did you know it was possible to know the deep things of Satan?
When a cultist walks out of history
And walks up to you and they're all dressed funny
You know, they got specific garments
Maybe it's the all one color
And it's got little fringes of this
And they, dude, they smell like
They've walked into a perfumery
And it exploded around them, right?
That's what they smell like
I mean, you know, it's kind of neat
You could put that person on an altar
Burn them and it would make the whole place smell great
They did that with fingers in the middle ages
So yeah, fantastic, fantastic
Let's go back to our text
The next text, yeah
Those are those who know those deep things, right?
Of Satan
And we don't, we don't
Because, you know, you're just a bunch of time traveling
Historian, investigators
Trying to bring forward a warrant
For Jesus Christ
And we're gonna catch him with a naked boy
In a public park, right?
Fantastic
Let's do another one
I will give to him
Ton astra, ton pro, oh, inon
See that lulumat looking thing?
Oh, the yod?
On that last word
That means you pronounce it too
It doesn't get sucked into any vowels around it, right?
I will give to him
The morning star
I will give to him the morning star
What is this with these people
And all of their drugs
And now we're getting drug after drug
And the stars and the me getting boosted up
Into the third uranos, the third heaven
Right?
It's a dirty, dirty party of drunkards
That's what it is
Did you ever notice that Peter, James, and John
Those three knuckleheads that were supposed to keep watch
While Jesus was with the naked kid
In the public park?
You know, at 4 a.m.
Did anybody notice that those three dudes
Kept falling asleep?
Yeah
Did anybody notice that the text says, and Mark says
Jesus is confused?
He's bewildered, bro
We got a dazed and confused Jesus
Strutting around in a public park
It's a cemetery at 4 in the morning
With the naked kid
And his guards fell asleep
Did you ever want to ask yourself
Next time you're in evangelicals
Next time you're in Sunday school
Ask your pastor or your Bible teacher
Right?
Even if you're, you know
Even if it's your, you're in junior Bible study
Right?
Doesn't have to be anything serious
Just approach your authority
And ask them
Ask them about that moment
Ask them about
Why are these guys all on drugs?
Why is one of them?
Why is Jesus calling himself a job
Trafficker?
Why is he doing this?
Right? Ask them
They won't know because kiddies
Because they follow the fairy tales
Right?
We're born and bred
In our land of the mouse
Our land of the
Of the great mouse of entertainment
Yeah, right?
So we follow our fairy tales
This one's a little bit darker
Right?
The actual history is
It's always more interesting
The fairy tale, you knew it
When you were reading it
You knew it
You were like, this stuff doesn't make sense
Right?
Well, okay here
We're here to show you what it actually was
So it will make sense
Go ahead
Bring the next one up
Now what comes out of the throne?
Okay, I'm going to say this
This is the climax
That I was hoping to get to with everybody
Okay, so hold on
Hold on, is anybody in the audience
Talking about the coming drugs?
This is fantastic
Okay, here we go
Are you ready?
The throne
Is the drug
In its compound form
And when you get the drug
What does it give you?
Here we have a description
Consistent across text
Including our Greek magical papyri
This is the same stuff that you guys
Saw in the Mithras liturgy
Right?
Same actions
What does the drug do?
What does the drug actually do
When you're sitting on the throne
This is fantastic
Let's go to the text
And see what the drug
Same text that we were just on
See what the drug does
From that throne comes
Astrapai
Astrapai
Kyfonai
Kybrontai
Oh my God
Phonai
Let's start with that
Voices
Voices
From the throne
Of Lady Babylon
Comes the voice
Love it
Love it
Gorgeous
Go back to the text
What else?
Astrapes, right?
Astrapai
Oh my God
When you look up
Look up
You know who was born
Of the
Astrapai
Astrapai
Astrapai
Astrapai
Astrapai
Astrapai
You know who was born
Of the
Astrapai
You know who was born
Of the lightning
Yeah
Simile
Mother of Dionysus
Who was born of the lightning
The virgin
Who had intercourse
With God
The virgin who had intercourse
With God
None of us believed her
So now we've got to sit through
The whole play
Isn't that gorgeous?
Oh my God
That's what comes out of the throne
Lightning
Lightning comes from the throne
And what else?
There's one more lightning
And voices
And
Brontae
Boom
Boom
You know who Brontae's is?
Oh dude
Dude, he's a world that sees
He's a monster
He's a monster born
Of this cosmos
Oh
Who sees in the round
His vision is the future
And the past
At the present
That's what you call
A cycle
Yeah
Cooklops
Alright
What do I need my thorn
And the flesh for?
I need to have
The lightning
I need to have the lightning
It's the power of God
Do you know what that lightning does?
Oh yeah
Yeah
Give me your lightning
Bathe me in your lightning
And with that
The initiates enter into the death
Behold
I have the flocks pulled
In my eyes
I am the son of God
Yeah
Son of Zeus
Son of Zeus
Let's keep going with the text
You're gonna be surprised when it all comes out
You're saying, wait a minute
These classical texts are overlapping with the Bible
Yes, yes, welcome
Right?
No, they weren't beams there
But a foreign planet
Right?
Out of context
No, give us back that passage, Chewie
Yeah, yeah
And from that throne
Right?
And from that throne is this burning fire, dudes
It's this burning source of light
Yeah, and what is all of that?
That's the seven plummeta
That's the seven spirits
In my hand
Seven stars
In my hand, seven stars
Yeah, okay
Okay, let's keep going
Go down to the next text
We're almost done
I made this go so long, people
And what did this angel do?
Now, for those of you who were thinking, okay
I'm too deep into this narrative
I'm gone
I don't know where I am
I forgot that we were at a ritual
I forgot there were novitiates
I forgot that there was an initiation
Right?
I'm losing the picture
For those of you who are at that place
Let's just go back to what's actually happening
And that's what this text gives us
This angelos, right?
This angel, he did what?
He grabbed up some libanoton
Right?
And a lot of people, a lot of the translations
Will give this to you as some kind of sensor
Or something to burn something in
Yeah
Only because it's post after the fact, right?
So he took some libanoton
And let's just look at what libanoton
Says frankincense
Yeah, frankincense
Guess what?
The magi are still there, people
Can you smell them?
When that magi came in and farted
Everybody smelled it for a week
Right?
That's the place we are historically
Here's the frankincense with him
Right?
And look at, it also means
Look at the very bottom, number three
Libanotris
What is it?
Libanotris
Well, I told my
I'm telling all of my Greek students
Right?
That everything in Greek
Can, goes back to some verb
Right?
They're verb heavy
For deriving words
And developing concepts
So it's very verb heavy
You just go back to the verbs
And see, what does it mean to
To libanotrisos something?
It means to fumigate it
With frankincense
To fumigate it
And what does it fumigate?
Remember the Sylians?
They don't take baths
They take, they fumigate themselves
With cannabis
Right?
Isn't that nice?
And who did we read?
A couple of days ago
Who did we read?
Was the origin of fumigation?
Who do they say was the origin of fumigation?
That was Semiramis, right?
So we're performing something
They were doing, they were doing
The queen of Babylon was doing, right?
The Medwa was the queen of Babylon
She is fumigating you
Fumigating you
Let's go back to the text
Yeah, and, um, no
Next one down
No, did we miss?
Where was that one?
We were just at
Here, leaving them out
Okay, um, yeah
So, yeah
I want you guys to see
That this frankincense is a big part of the picture
And it gets so crazy
That the frankincense is used
To be able to see the future
So there are libanomanes
There are mantics
Who are entering a frankincense mania
A frankincense mania, right?
Okay
And, um, that's because
They've been fumigated one too many times
And libanomana is really the grain
Now here, we're going to crack something
Those of you who are going to say
Oh, oh, this is Hebrew
Oh, manna is Hebrew, right?
You fell into the same trap, right?
There you are in Desaad's palace
And he's got you down there
He's got you tied up
He's doing things
You got to take what's in that bowl
That the priest pushes out into the hallway
You got to take what's in that
And give it to the other guy
And the other guy will smear it all over his body
And, um, you know, it's a thing
It's a thing
Welcome to the world of Desaad
Those of you who thought that was the picture
Manna
Manna is not a Hebrew word
It's a Greek word that was there before
The earliest proto-Hebrew
Yes, but you only believed it
Because you took the Masoretic path
You followed King James
Even if you didn't care, right?
It's just the way you were pushed
So, yeah, one of those
What is manna?
Manna is actually a granular form
It's a type of...
When you take the drug
And you can break it into a powder
You can prepare it as a powder
Some kind of granule
In order to burn those, right?
That's what they're talking about with that manna
So, the frankincense manna
Is simply that powdered frankincense
And if we can put back up a couple more
Let's...
From where we were
Put it where we were
Good
Look at what this is
Libanomontis
What's a Libanomontis?
You didn't believe me when I said this
But here this person is
One that divides from the smog of frankincense
So, these magi that were high
Right?
Because all magi are high all the time
Right?
What do they do for...
What do they do for Jesus?
They're giving him the drugs that he will need
To kick himself
Into uranos
To be that son
You know, you see how it works?
You can't be the Christo
Somebody this week was telling me
That a classicist told them
It turns out this person wasn't a classicist
Anywhere, they're a New Testament scholar
Right?
And a New Testament scholar
Who's been reading Josephus
Did somebody just crack one?
It smells like dirty rotten onions in here
Sulfur
Purify this place, bro
Right?
When I hear somebody's read Josephus
Or translated Josephus
I smell the fart of eggs
Yeah, I do
When somebody quotes Josephus
What you need to do is realize
An angel just farted in your face
Yeah
Right in your face
It's not funny
It's not funny
It's not
You can stop angel farting
Okay
Alright
We have to do the Greek
And this person was saying
Christ, it just means to be rubbed with oil
Mashiach
Right?
It starts quoting some things that are not in the text
And have nothing to do with the words
No
The Greeks, if this guy had read more than Josephus
He would know
That alepho is the common word
For rubbing oil into somebody
Right?
Chrio comes originally
From the word that means to be stung by the gap fly
When you have the thorn in your flesh
You are invincible
You are invincible
And you have that oracle of Jehovah
You've got his oracle
You've got that place open
Right?
Next thing you know
You'll get the flocks in your eyes
You'll get those brazen feet
You'll get those brazen feet
What's he doing with those brazen feet, right?
You know, it's
We need to realize that this is people or people
And that what we've got is a cult
Full of drugged out sex maniacs
And once you come to those
That understanding
When you see those parameters of what your religion is
It kind of makes a lot more sense
Yeah, it makes a lot more sense
And all of a sudden, those funny odd passages that have what
We don't really translate them
Shame on you people
Shame on you scholars
That you didn't give this information
Okay, do we have any more texts?
We're going awfully long
I just want you to see that this mania
Can also just come from another oyster
Another sting
Another gadfly
Right?
How did she prophesy?
She prophesies your honor through the power
Of that oyster
Now wait, bring that back up
I want everybody to see this
Look at, if you look up mana
Right?
You'll get right away
A division, A and 2
And one of them appears to be
Based upon really hardcore Greek texts
Look at the first one that's mentioned
Diascortes
He's a doctor
Who deals in drugs
He writes about drugs
That's his thing
Look at Hippocrates is in here
Using it
Orabaceous
That's the personal physician of Julian the Apostate
Look Galen
That's the personal physician of Marcus Aurelius
So this word is used from an older Greek meaning
Which then they had to, the Victorians had to say
Wait a minute
We know that half of us are Bible scholars
And they're going to want to say
This is from Hebrew
Garbage
Garbage
Garbage, I define you to find me a word in English like that
No, it has magical roots in a different language
No, no, no, that's just bad linguistics, bro
That is just appropriation from the Maserites
Right?
This has got to be the holy Hebrew
Hebrew has got to be the holy language
You can't be not the oldest
Right?
It can't be
And if it makes you feel any better
You want to trace those roots through Babylon
Through Ur
No, no, no, dude
Dude
This mystery is being performed before
Before your people
And before the people that came before your people
Yeah, this is old
This is old stuff
Right?
So if you're going to argue
If you're going to argue linguistics
Don't use the ones that are made up
Don't use the tools that are made up
Get the science going
Did you see how that word men is used
Within the medicine?
Did you see all those doctors I just showed you?
Guess what?
Bible scholars don't read
They don't read this stuff
You are getting information
That nobody else is getting
This opens up a reality
That you didn't know was there but is
Yeah
We just went into their citadel
We knocked everything down
Right?
Get off that
Get off that guardian
I can see him over there
I can see everybody
We'll just burst in like a bunch of mean ads
We'll take our clubs
And we'll just bust everything to pieces
Yeah, turns out
Christianity
Turns out you are based
In sexual gratification
While under the influence of mind altering drugs
Your master entered into death
For the sake of being revived
Yes
A bunch of dirty cultists
You'll never wipe off that stain
Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park
With a naked boy
Tonight we got the thorn in the flesh
We have the messenger of Satan
We have Satan himself
Providing us with that
Oracular voice
What do I want to see from that throne?
I want to see the lightning
I don't want to hear voices
This is gorgeous people
We're getting there
We're getting there
And with a little bit more deep diving
You will be able to assemble all of the drugs necessary
For your own Christian mystery
Yes, yes
For the next time we meet
We will be looking at our ability
To revive the mystery
And we're going to do that
By looking at people who have done it in the past
And who wrote about it
And wrote about the experience
And the people who entered into it
And the people who didn't like them
The people who tried to shut them down
So we'll get a little bit of the history of the mystery
That's what we'll get
Thank you for your time tonight
I appreciate it
And I want to remind everybody that Zane Campbell
Is seeing the songs of our Satanic initiation
Is right now working on a new song
About Jesus and a naked boy in a public park
Thank you for coming tonight
Everybody have a good weekend
Hail Satan
Go ahead and drink and whiskey
Oh, yeah
