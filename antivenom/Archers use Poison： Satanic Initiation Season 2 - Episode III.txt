Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that whore called Destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Welcome back, we have a great night tonight
I'm going to take you guys somewhere that nobody else is ever going to take you
Yeah, I'm going to take you into the heart of ancient Roman medicine
We're going to look in the drawer of Claudius, the emperor
We're going to pull out an actual scene
I'm going to show you what happens when you take the drug of communion and you enter the mystery
We're going to begin tonight with a guy named Scribonius Largus
We're going to find him, we're going to pull him from the grave
We're going to talk to him and see what he says in his own words
We're going to see what he says about these cults that you and I have been looking at
We're going to look at the Saturnian Toxicum
What is the Saturnian Toxicum?
Let's pull that down
I want to first explain to you that we're looking at
What I'm going to show you tonight is Latin, first of all
We're not going to look at Greek, we're going to look at Latin
We're going to look a little bit of Greek
But we're going to look at the Roman side through the physician who was connected to the legions
And may or may have not been a chief physician to Claudius
But he was certainly from what he talks about, he was certainly involved with military medicine
Fantastic
Personally he preserved for us a work called the Compositione
Which is prescription after prescription after prescription for different types of compound drugs
He doesn't talk, he's not big on theory, he's big on practice and what works in treatment
What we can do with all sorts of injuries
For today we have the example of the Aeropoison
And I want to just take you there to begin with
Let's go to Scribonius here
And I want you to take a look at this passage at the bottom
You notice the very first word is Toxicum
So this is a very specific drug compound that he's about to tell us about
And that is not a native Latin word
When you see that Xe you're going to know that you're taking a loan word from the Greek
And the Greek is Toxicum, can we bring up Toxicum please?
The top, good
And if you just take a quick look at this definition
You'll notice right away over for the bow
Wait a minute, I thought you were talking about drugs here
I am, just wait, we'll get there
You talk about a kind of Cretan reed, right?
The Calamus
The toxic Calamus is a kind of Cretan reed that was used for arrows
Arrows, we're talking bow culture with this word right?
And if you look down Roman numeral number two
A person skilled in the use of the bow
Here we have a bow culture right?
I bet they got horses too
But I want you to look at Roman numeral number three
Notice the bowmen, the Tuxotai
Those bowmen are there
But then under number two we have Toxicum pharmacone
A poison for smearing arrows with
Yes, and you see at the very bottom it's the equivalence of the Wenanum
He's saying here it's a toxin, it's a drug
Fantastic, so let's go back to the text that we've got from Scribonius
I just want you to notice a couple of words
And then I'm going to show you a video
But I want you to notice Toxicum
And when somebody gets a hold of this stuff
Whether they're drinking it, he says
Or whether it's inflicted from an injury
It's the same response that the person has
And what is this terrible, terrible reaction?
Right away
This is terrible pain in the guts
All of the guts
All over the guts, terrible pain
Like someone threw a javelin through you
Yeah, and it creates a furorementis
It creates a crazed state of mind
A fury, not just any sort of craze
But a fury
A fury of mind
What else does this thing do?
It compels its users to
Exululare
Exululare
That's to make an ululation
But to do it in the Bacchic way
With head back
Isn't that wonderful?
Wonderful description
Look, they're making Bacchic shouts
Screams
Can you do the Bacchic scream?
You can do the Bacchic scream, right?
This drug will let you do the Bacchic scream
And what else?
Et pal patata e lingua similiter?
Oh, it gets a little bit gross here
I gotta put a rating on this
You guys better watch out
Because this gets pretty gross
It causes you to throw around your tongue
Just like someone whose head has just been cut off
Now, they are watching heads get cut off
In all sorts of ways
So apparently you had to be there
To see the heads get cut off
But apparently you got some funny stuff
That you do with your tongue
And when your head gets cut off
And these people who are in the
Minatic revelry
Enter into this stage
With the Toxicon
It's the drug that is used
People are saying, now wait
Okay, we're gonna spank someone
When we get back
But what I want you to do now
Is finish this gorgeous text
Because it is full of goodies
I want you to see a little video
That I've prepped for you
And this video will explain to you
In images and in song
It'll explain to you in images
And in song the direction
That Scrobonius is leading us
With his Toxicon
Yes, chewy, hit it
I can't see no future
For me in this world
And looking back on the past
If it's gonna be more of the same
Calling into the game
Cause I've had about enough of that
And they wonder why
I turn to the wine
I turn to the wine
Every time I get lonely
I turn to the wine
Every time that I do
I turn to the wine
And the wine
Turns on me
Agree
And the blues
Turn to darker
Blue every blue
And the blues
Turn to darker
Blue every blue
And the blues
Turn to darker
Blue
And the blues
It's all in the venoms, man
I'm telling you, it's all in the venoms
Your history was created
By a group of women
Who were getting people to enter
Into death and life states
To be reborn with a toxic venom
A toxic venom
This is the heart of the mystery
And let's see what else
Let's see what else we can do with that
Toxic venom
That they're using on their arrow
I know that we can get there
If we milk those snakes
Can we milk some snakes?
So there we have it
What helps in these cases, Scrobanius?
Tell us, what can you do?
So you've had your taste of it
You've had your drink of it
And he specifies, this is for the ones
Who partake in the quotation
This is them, right?
It's the same effect it has
Hitting somebody with it on the arrow
But this is the paralyzing fear
That one enters into
When one is under the influence
Of the drug that allows you
To ascend into death
And to be resurrected
And what helps for it?
Well, you know, for those who drink it
It's, we need to, you know
Get some rose, some potable rose
It's interesting, some rose potion
Okay, get some rose potion
And is there anything else?
Sure, there's a couple other plants
But I want you to mix it with
Lactae et antidoto mistridatio
With milk and with the, again
Milk doesn't have to be milk
Like you think milk
But it says milk
So milk and the mistridatic antidote
Which is funny
And it makes perfect sense contextually
I don't know why classes don't use any of this
But it makes perfect sense because
The impernero is interested
In the very same antidote
So it would make sense that
Again, we're in a crime scene
We have to step back and we realize
That we're reading to you
The witness tonight is a witness
Connected with the legions
This is the highest of the high
You know, this is the first
And you're the last, right?
This is the one
And he is bringing the recipes
For the antidotes that are using
Conjunction with the pagan mystery communion
Yeah, yeah, fantastic
Right above that, you'll see ephemeron
And the recipe above that
You'll see ephemeron
That is what we call
Culturescene, right?
Yeah, we get culturescene from it, right?
Caucus
It's literally the Greek, just caucas
Right?
So it's one of those ones
And be careful with that one
It tells you, you burn yourself with that one
Right?
You get quite burned up
I want to show you
I want to read to you
A little bit of Valerius flakus
I want to read to you
A little bit of Valerius flakus
And I want you to see
The
Working of the ancient magic
What is the person doing?
Okay, so we know that they're entering the right
And that they're using
That they're milking vipers
They're milking vipers
They're milking poisonous venomous snakes
In order to make
To add ingredients to these
Communions that they're using
Yeah, these potions
These compound
This compound drug
That ultimately will end up
Ultimately will end up with the
With the medwa
Now somebody was asking me
Do we know if they smoked?
And this is an old question
And one that I was just asking you
Do we know if they smoked?
They performed fumigations
They performed fumigations
Did they walk around with marborals in antiquity?
Is Claudius going to worry about his troops
Pulling out that he's responsible
For pulling out marborals?
No, he's not
He's got to be worried about them
Entering into fumigations
That will get them involved
In drinking things
And administering things evenly
And administering things
By incisions on the skin
And by performing things like this
Fumigation, you fill the whole room
It's like hot boxing
You just fill the whole room with fumes
Remember, your religions
Are based upon taking incense
And putting them upon a burning altar
This is where everything starts
Your western religions are built upon that
I can't speak for these
But for the western religions
They're built upon that
This burning of the incense and temples
Come on, Jehovah never lied about that one
He lied about a lot
But he didn't lie about that one
Pull down those temples
Where they're burning incense to those gods
Where they're entering those states
So breathing
Breathing this incense
Breathing this fumigated substance
Is that like smoking?
Yeah, if you're getting fumigated
You might as well be
You're a step up from secondary
That's for sure
You're probably classified as secondary smoking
Okay, that's neat
I want to read you a little passage
From Valerius Flakis now
To bring us all to a place where we're at the same spot
This guy, Coastes
Who comes from the west
To the east to see Medea
In performing what she became so well known for
That we can't even translate properly
So tonight we looked at somebody
Entering a bachic phase
With these drugs
We saw them entering this hilarity
Head back saying the things
That Skrobonius says are hard to be interpreted
What they say
So now I want to go to this
Late Bronze Age
Worker of sorcery, Coastes
That we see in Valerius Flakis' Argonautica
His story about the Medwa
He says, mightiest among them
In Stygian Arts
Coastes comes
He's the mightiest
What is the Stygian?
In the what?
The Stygian Arts
Yeah
Those are the underworld arts
Yeah, those are the arts
That make us all afraid
At night when we have our nightmares
Those are the arts that are doing it
These are the necromancers
Necromancers
Anyway
Not love of war excites him
But the fame of the Scythian-made
Medea breathing poisons
In match to his own
That's the translation
Who is this?
I'm going to give you the Mosley
This is the Mosley translation
But in the line that he translates
Poisons equal to yours
Is the difficulty
There's a difficulty with the Greeks
Just a terrible, I mean with the Latin
Just a terrible, terrible difficulty
And I will
I will read it to you in Latin
And translate it literally
So
The love of war
The love of Mars does not move him
Love of Mars, don't you love that?
Now you know why the fleece
Which the garden
Which the dragon guards
Is hanging in the grove of Mars
It's important that you understand that
Image-wise, it's important that you understand
Put yourself in that place
In the grove of Mars
Yes, so not the love of Mars
Sed fama catai virginis
But the Scythian virgin
Medea
Yeah
Yeah, doing what?
Spirans, what draws him?
Her? Spirans
Breathing
Inhaling
Paribus
Wenanis
Balanced
Drugs, poisons
Inhaling them
Yeah, now we call this
And we see this on the medical side
This breathing of the
Of the drug
And remember these drugs that they're using
They're not all things that they aerosolize, right?
These are not all fumigations that they're performing
There's a lot of incense involved
And there's a lot of exposure to that incense
But a lot of these that are administered
Rectally, orally, ocular-wise
And slits in the skin
A lot of these drugs are
Not kinds that you would use in fumigations
So what exactly it's meaning
History, what is it meaning
When it says he was so impressed
This necromancer, right?
Now that he's gone, the text says
Now that he left his homeland to come see this
To come see the Medwa
Perform this act
He, the people can sleep
Safely and soundly
Because he's no longer drawing down the moon
Yeah
He's no longer drawing down the moon
So he is with her now
In order to see her breathe
In these equal
These balanced poisons
Yeah
And that word for breathing is
Associated in antiquity with the Romans
With the inspiration
The breath of inspiration
Right? She is a Wirago
We just read about a Wirago last time, correct?
We saw that Eve, the one who cries Ewa
She is the Wirago
We saw that's how they described her as the Wirago
We are squarely with Roman Minerva
Squarely with her
And it is she that gets us to that place
By worship of the muses
By worship of the muses
She gets us to that place
And her breathing
Her breathing is through
Equally balanced drugs
Equally balanced poisons
She's oftentimes said
Seneca claims that she has a compound
Created from different
Venoms, snake-venoms
And in her very authentic incantation
She invokes Ophiuchus
So we are seeing now
You see in the tradition of the epics
In the poetic traditions
You see Medea's medicine emerging
But you can see the very same medicine
In the text of the imperial doctors
Of the highest ranking imperial doctors
And in the doctors who serve people like Nero
So we are one step closer to completing the scene
Completing that crime scene
Our concern and people have been talking about this
Our concern is to bring back Lady Babylon
That's the mission, right?
To understand that reality
To see and to have eyes to see and ears to hear
To not follow a fairy tale
But to worship reason and honor reason
So we want to bring back that image
We are stuck here at this scene with Jesus
Jesus Christ arrested in a public park
Slash cemetery at early morning hours
With a naked boy
And what is he doing there?
Under those circumstances
We are beginning to be able to see at least a history
Of where these drug rights come from
And to see that they are entrenched
Within very high levels of ancient society
There is a reason that the Bacchic suppression
Of 186 or 185, whatever it is
That that was a reaction to this cult
Operating within the highest levels of the aristocracy
We're told that it was the women that were getting rounded up
And it said they were arresting the wives of senators
Who were involved
And how did they know that they were involved in the conspiracy?
Because of the drugs?
Yeah, because of the drugs, that's how they identified them
Isn't it interesting to know that if it was a conspiracy
As the Romans viewed it as a conspiracy
Not just the free expression of religion
But we're talking when religion and political power
Are the same thing
Yes, you see the Bacchins today
When we say, when the Romans say yes it was a conspiracy
Because they were trying to take power
We need to consider then that this is really
This is no longer fairy tale world
This is a very human place that we've come to
And we need to consider these sources
If I were to tell you some of the secrets that are in these things
That you might start getting paranoid
About uncovering even further what is behind the facade
Were women staying at home?
All of these drug traditions come from female practice
The oldest ones that we have come from the gynecology and obstetrics
So somebody out there right now is talking about the use of aero poisons
Until that's great, congratulations
It used to be that people would openly deny
Scholars would openly deny, no they didn't use drugs
There's no drugs involved
I just read you an entire drug passage about antidotes to a drug that gets you so high
You babble and blurt and wiggle your tongue like you've just been decapitated
And we just discussed the antidotes used to bring those people back from that edge
So were they using drugs?
Wake up, wake up and smell the opium
But that's old, it used to be you had to fight against that
People would say no, no they didn't use drugs
Because they don't want to look at their history in the context of people using drugs
Can we really say Augustus who brought the poxromana that he was an opium swiller?
Yeah we can, yeah we can
Scrobotius says so, yes, but we don't want to say those kind of things
Now we're at the step, now we're at the step where we know this is the renaissance
This is the renaissance of the psychedelics
This is the toxic step forward that's always necessary in order to initiate the spark
In order to start the spark, the apocalypse that brings that return
It's a cyclical mystery, right? Death and rebirth
So I wanted you tonight to see that there is a tradition that has left behind evidence
Good strong linguistic evidence
First hand testimony, you get Scrobotius up in trial, up in the stand
There's nothing better, right out of their mouths, you can't deny it
It's right out of their mouths
So if we are at that point that we are determining what that crime scene involves with Jesus
Now we know, we know that the drug side of things goes way back
And is heavily influential in the contemporary time, in his century when he is
Scrobotius is the early first century, right? He's exact contemporary with Jesus
He probably died within a few years, not a few years
But shortly after Jesus died, to complete contemporary
And we have in that contemporary, we have the use of these drugs
For the sake of entering into a state of mystery communion
The process of being born again
Now, tonight, and I thank you
Tonight I want to finish with two people, with Rob and Snappy
And before we go to Rob and Snappy, I want Snappy to step up and give us a two minute presentation
On some of the things that are going on behind the scenes with the Discord
And what good news we've got from that, Snappy, go for it
Alright, thank you Amon, so first off the Discord has reached over 100 members
So thank you everyone for joining
And over a dozen of you have decided to either shave your heads or walk the path of Aphrodite
And as Amon was saying, big things are happening
Right now we are working at establishing our very own temple to the muses
First we're looking about doing this online
We have Dr. Buzzard who's working at making a wiki
And he's right now working on the Javascript for that
And there's also been discussion about recreating and developing our own order of the rose
The idea behind this would be to organize ourselves and to create a sort of fraternity but without those gender distinctions
We want to come together and form a stronger community and create some organization so that we can focus on this
Like I was speaking to Amon and we want to have people who are dedicated to the magic
People who are dedicated to archiving this
People who are dedicated to sourcing the mystery directly
People who are looking for Medea in other cultures and so on
There's so much that we can focus on and we'd love it if you guys all came to the Discord
And we could all pile together and work this out and start to organize ourselves a little more formally
Yeah, and excellent, excellent
And I can't tell you how much it means to me
The pool of you who are interacting now on this Discord are so aggressively reason-oriented
Yeah, just good pagan Satanist, you know, just the salt of the earth
This is how it should be
And I'm truly impressed and humbled
So Rob now has an idea for, you know, ideas for how the direction of the museum can go
And what it's my job to do is to step back and let the people who are just, we have such a resource of people here
That can really help design things and can open up this virtual space
Because you know that most of us have broken out of cults
And most of us are coming in that direction as reasonable Satanists
And most of us are necromancers at heart and want to raise the dead
And want to achieve something
So people have been asking me what is our goal and what is our mission
And I will just add this, if it is anything short of bringing back Lady Babylon
Then why would we do it? Why would we do it at all?
Rob, what's your vision of a museum? Tell me what you're working on
Well, I've been working on it for a while now
But in philosophical terms, because I haven't really, I haven't set anything up that is concrete
And if I'm honest, I need some help in setting it up
But where I had very early days, I had the idea of forming another discord
Which is more centered towards these episodes
Which features the very sources that are in the episodes
For people who want to go a little bit deeper and focus on the source material that are featured in the episodes
Just like a specific kind of nature, but also aware of the fact that that might offend the current discord
So it's been a slow progress because the discord as it is is fantastic
And it's not something that you could say needs work, it doesn't need any work at all
It's not that kind of expression where I'm trying to attain, what I'm trying to attain is some sort of special area
For people who really want to engage with the material what are in the episodes rather than
Because there's a wide variety of opinions, of varied ideas
And the brilliant idea, it isn't like you'd want to close that down because you should look everywhere for all your information
Your information should come from random sources, all sorts of sources
Everywhere what can spark different ideas and that's the nature of the discord because you're going to get all these ideas out there
And that's fantastic and that goes on, that's what's going on
There's also a more specific side that I personally want to address
For example, I'm going to use tonight, for example, we talk about the toxins on the ends of these arrows
And these arrow poisons and you'll shoot them into somebody and it has this dramatic effect upon them
And I want now is how you get from that point to rubbing it on something that's shaped like a dildo for an application in a ritual
That's where I want to go, I want to go into that, I don't really want to go...
Obviously it's a part of it that you want to go broader and you want to see the comparative differences
And also the areas out there are comparative and you can draw them in and say
Well, this culture is doing the same type of thing but that has got its own forum
There isn't a forum for that specific, well, you know, what's in that toxin that kills you
But can also be applied to the body in another way
And that's what I'd like to focus on to be clear
Yeah, so you can see, okay, this is perfect
You can see how Rob focuses in on kind of a refinement of an academic type of branch of this grand virtual...
I'm sorry, you see that's like people thinking oppositions
So it's like it's not an opposition to, it's a complementary side approach to an already successful discord
It's not meant as any sort of...
Getting what you want out of that discord because you are, you literally are
Yeah, and we're all coming at this from the same start
We're all coming at it from the same start
So it's just like you said, you need some help in how to design this, right?
That's the brilliance of what's going on is that we're connecting now
All these minds and expertise now are connecting, we're on the same frequency
Christians and the Jews and Muslims, Hindus, they're going to start doing, they're going to see what we have here
And they're going to start, if they haven't already, they're going to flood to this because this is the movement
People are not going to be going to buildings, right?
We have to think of the future
And the future is for us constructing this virtual temple, right?
We start with this temple of muse and we will build a city
I know that people are interested in different areas, people want the magic, right?
They want to, we have to start a magic class immediately
There has to be a specialty
We have to get people to understand the rudiments of necromancy
And again, not by preaching, not by teaching, but giving people the sources
By giving people the sources and saying, look, don't trust me
Trust what this witch from the fourth century said
Because that's what we're harkening back to
Yeah, tell me
I think Rob raises an interesting concern though
And this is something that I think we need to address is that we need to focus in on certain things
And we need to have, like you were bringing up Amon, we need to have sort of designated organizations
Where people are focused on specific things
Like if we can be more organized in our approach, we can have a better way of understanding these things
So people who are more dedicated to tracing the mystery and what the drugs are
And people who are more interested in the magic, but we all, like you said, and we all need to be doing the necromancy
But that's the idea where we're at right now is that the Discord is wonderful for invoking this freedom
And invoking ourselves to just follow the muse, but it does lack cohesion
And what your episodes bring is that cohesion
And I think that's what we need to try and do going forward as we try to make this a little more formal
And create our order of the rose is have a more dedicated focus and have people streamlined
And dedicated to specific pursuits
Yeah, let me ask you both this question while we're here
And maybe we can bounce this off the audience somehow
We have a real duty to put together this scene
And to figure out what Jesus is doing with this naked boy
And what are the details of it? We have a duty to delve into that
We have a duty to bring that
If we're bringers of reality, right? If we're trying to tell people, look, what you've been sold is a fairy tale
And let me show you what's actually there in order to open up their, to take off their blinders
And to free them, if we are really going to perpetuate the Bacchic freedom
Then we're going to have to have a mission that's oriented to those people who are currently enslaved
We have to be ministers to the enslaved, do we not?
Oh, definitely, right? But the question is how do we approach this too?
Because there's also was a lot of concern on the discord like both Rat King and Dion brought this up
It's like they're in California, they could start a church tomorrow if we wanted to
But you're going to get a lot of people who are looking for wish fulfillment
Who aren't necessarily seeking the same things that we're seeking
So we have to be, not exclusive, but we have to be careful in our approach, right?
We're not a church, right? We're trying to invoke the mystery
We're trying to bring that back, we're trying to bring Lady Babylon back
We're something new, we're something different, you know?
Yeah, let me elaborate just by saying that's why I used the detective metaphor
Because that's all we can do. Who are we people? Are we part of some special organization? No
Are we funded by billionaires? No
Are we some kind of special illuminati? No
We're just average people who want to know what the reality is
We want to put aside the bullshit with the academics
We want to step aside from the hoo-ha and from the sale
The wholesale shopping out of the prostitution of history
You know what I'm talking about
We want to put those things aside and we want to just get down to that basic level of the evidence
That's what we are
I would never ever want to start a church
I would never want to start a church, you know?
Or any sort of organization that was anything beyond a salon of people who were influencing the world around them
By their worship of the muse
It's all that matters, you know? Let them have the world
Rob, what do you think our mission is?
We're getting further into this
We're getting further into the mystery
The more episodes we're putting out
The more people are becoming accustomed to what you're presenting
And that's only ever been my mission to get your work out there
So people can review it and just have a look at it for themselves
It's had a profound effect upon me
But that doesn't mean I'm not...
I just want to get it out there for everybody to see
But also what you can't forget is how bloody huge this subject becomes
It isn't... I mean, it's very commendable to want to...
What I wanted was focusing on the episodes
And that is monumental in itself
If you go... People will know and they will be doing this and going back through the episodes
And then they will be taking notes and they will be looking things up just as I've done
And you just can't... You've got to...
I'm sure then people will appreciate it how huge this unfolds
It unfolds and unfolds and unfolds
And when you try and fold it back up into a nice neat little package of explainability
It's almost ineffable
And that's a problem what we face is understanding to go into the minutiae of things is a good thing
But also coming out and having this overview
If you come out and you look at the overview and you look at the subjects you cover with the mysteries
It's enormous, I'm sure I'm messing up expressing that
But it's what I've found is you think you're moving forward and you think you're learning a lot
And then you realise how little you do know about this subject
And it's overwhelming that feeling
Because you get to a certain stage where you think I'm comfortable with this information now
And you understand this information
And then the next piece you go into, it can blow your mind and open up another column rabbit holes for you to explore
And that's what I've found fascinating with your work
You need to just start that spark, get them people to see that initial spark
And get what you're trying to put across
Because then you're on a roll and you just go with it
And I've been at this for two years, been at this for two years
And I don't miss a day, a day doesn't go by that it doesn't cross my mind
And I'm sure there are people out there who are experiencing the same thing
I just think there should be a place where this can be discussed
Especially the episodes and the broader aspects of the mysteries because you go on the discord
The current discord is enormous, there's subjects, it's fantastic
And that's the wide broad scope of what you can learn
And it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it never stops and you only realise how little you know
What's your opinion of that? And would you say that's accurate?
Well I think we're deeper than everybody else aren't you?
I think we're getting closer, if you're walking into that temple and it says hey, know who you are
Then yeah, the more you're saying oh I don't know and the more you're getting deeper into it
The more Bacchic you're becoming and if you forget you can write it on your arm
And you can say Bacchus says you don't know who you are, you don't know what you're doing
You don't know what kind of life you're living
If we can get ourselves to the point that we're free
It's not dependent upon a person or any sort of institution or any sort of dogma
It's a real freedom, it's a freedom you can't take away from somebody
You know, you can't, I don't care what you can tell me now
As soon as I've seen Jesus in the garden with the goop on his face
And oh God, take this cup away, right?
And there's stuff going on, there's cops, freeze, freeze and there's a naked kid
And swords sway and stuff, once you've been to that scene
And the crowd is like kill him, kill him
And by the way, those of you who are writing and saying you're blaspheming, you're right
You're right, I am, I am
In order to achieve that breakthrough we have to see Jesus Christ for who he was
He was a man arrested in a public park with a naked boy
When you go to drink of his blood and eat of his flesh
You are promoting a rapist pedophile
Your institutions are the institutions of rapist pedophiles
Your conspiracy queue groups are institutions that have promoted the greatest rapist pedophile of all time
You are guilty, you have that all over your skin, you have it all over your nation
You have created an association of liars who promote a man who was arrested in a public park with a naked boy
It's time for reality
Guys, thanks for joining me tonight
And I'm sure that the brains behind what's going on
There's so much brain snappy in this discord that I'm sure it's going to congeal
I mean, I don't want to step in the way
So to everybody that's involved, let's keep involved
And Hail Satan
Hail Satan
Good talking to you
