Sunday morning, dark clouds rising Oh, there's no sunshine anywhere
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom To grasp the message in the air
Oh, if I could have one wish And know that it would come true
Had a wish that God would give us strength To know just what to do
Then we could tear down the fences That fences all new
Fences created by such evil men Then we could tear down the fences
That fences all new Maybe we could walk together again
Tonight we're going to mainline with Jesus
Yeah, you heard me, you heard me Tonight on Lady Babylon
We are going to mainline with Jesus
You didn't know he was like that, did you?
I'm going to show you how to get Christed
Then I'm going to introduce you to a vampire
Tonight on Lady Babylon
Here we go, here we go
Okay, tonight, before we push in, I'm going to start with a couple of comments
And I want to start by saying, we're always going to have a good in the bed
I wanted to start by saying, Snappy, thank you so much
For letting me know that I needed to get you the source
People were not believing when I said Medea was the queen of Babylon
They looked at me funny
So, we got the source eventually
And sometimes, oh, Philostratus, yeah, I almost forgot him right there
Anywho says that she's the queen of Babylon
Thank you, Snappy, for pushing on that one
Right, those sources are good
I'm giving your guys and religious studies
I'm giving them a hard time, I'm bashing them around
You, sir, are attached to the sources
And I respect that, I respect that
Tonight, let's go to the good comment to start with
Who sent me something nice?
Just please, can I just feel, I want to feel good about myself
This is Humble Thanker, I like that name
Dr. Amen, is Mary Magdalene to Jesus as Medea is to Jason?
Wow, that's the most spectacular question
And I'm going to answer it linguistically
There is a 16th century cryptologist
Who talks about the Magdalene being a Scythian word
That is the equivalent of the Maga
Not the Magos, but the Maga
This is the one that came before
Did the witch come before the wizard?
Yes, it turns out historically she did
Who else was going to figure out all that stuff?
Right, took a lot of brains
Here we go, here we go
I want to bring you that Maga
That Maga is the Medwa
And that Medwa is in charge
Is in union with the Jesus
So is there a relation between them?
These are all cult titles people
We're going to read these things over and over again
Wow, until we see it, it's all there
Great question, that's what happens when you stay in the cult
Right, it's what happens when you get the queen and the Christ
Isn't that nice? Love it
Who do you think was supplying all the drugs?
It wasn't Jesus
He knows how to make the punch
But he was getting it all from Mary
The Maga
You can call her a prostitute if you want to
But tonight, since we're going to mainline
We're going to mainline with Jesus
And I know some of you are sensitive about using terms like that
We're talking about historical mainlining
We're going to find that place
Where you can take that Christed poison
And get it right into the blood
Fantastic, fantastic
I've got to give you the best stuff
That's why you're here, I know your time is limited
I'm stopping at 30 tonight, I'm going to stop myself
So let's get to the vampire that I'd like to bring you first
Let's wash it, oh we need another con
I forgot the bad, we've had the good, we have to have the bad
Okay, throw up the bad
Okay, this is from Naruto
Another interesting experience
Particularly unpleasant
Particularly unpleasant
Not just unpleasant, it's particularly unpleasant
I expected at least, at very least
Something from Philo, okay take it down
I cannot take this person seriously anymore
I can't, no I'm going to laugh, I'm going to laugh
And it's rude, it's rude to do that
But my children, in the world there are perpetrators with trench coats
And they will take you places and do things to you
Yeah, yeah, that's what they do
It's their nature
If I were at a professional conference
In the middle of a bunch of classical philologists
Who had given the sweat and blood and earned that spot
If I pulled out Philo
Right away, right away
You lose your credibility, right away when you do that
Naruto, you lose your credibility
Because Naruto, there are Bible studies
There are studies of the Torah
There are Bible studies, there are seminaries
There are New Testament departments
And in these departments Naruto
There are no philologists
Philologists are those who have reached a level of expertise
Where they are expected to go to the international gymnasia and wrestle
That's what they're expected to do
You cannot get by on what Bible studies does for you
It is a sinking ship that has been barely floating for the last 1600 years
You see, because there's a problem in the universe
The problem is the classical philologists are the professionals with the classical texts
You should be able to throw a classical philologist
Anything from Homer, throw him a little bit of Tacitus
How about some Juvenile?
Do you know how to do meter between both languages?
Those are the people that you consult
What's weird in this universe
The watchers still haven't figured it out
But what's really weird here
Is that those experts are experts in everything but the Bible
And the Septuagint included when I say Bible
Yeah
And do you know why?
Let me just tell you, as a former prof myself
You do not want to risk the engagement
Because a classical philologist, I'm just telling you this tonight
A classical philologist can tear your BS apart
Because for every second that you have read
They have read millions
It is their life
They have devoted themselves to this sacred space
So when you pull out Philo, that's what the seminarians do
That's what the religious schools do
And look, my children
When these people in trench coats come to you
They're going to open that trench coat
They're going to open it up
With a big seminarian smile on their face
They're going to show you the twins
Josephus and Philo
And you're going to gag on those twins
You're going to gag on them
What I recommend you do
Because the people at the time said
Hey, you know that guy Josephus
He's making up sources
Right?
That's a huge problem
This all culminates, people
Please understand me why this is so important
This all culminates
In Julian the Apostate, we call him
Julian the Apostate
Who made a decree
Nobody can teach classics
Who's an atheist
Interesting
And why would that be Julian?
Because they corrupt the text
It's their intention
In establishing their own fake history
Do you mean this is about power?
This is about power
Essentially about a power grab
Oh yeah, what do you think those humans do?
Aren't you guys the apesco boy?
Aren't you the ones who are watching all of this go around?
Oh god, let's hit some text
Let's purify it
Here's the vampire
I want to purify us now with the vampire

ready. Let's go see Jesus
mainlining. I want to give you
the first tonight of our
texts. Um,
yep, go ahead and pull that up.
I want to just give you up. Take it
down real quick. Let me give him an intro
while I'm talking. Sorry. Yes.
Um,
Elian. Elian.
Uh, who's this person?
Um, to your phylo.
See, that's the thing. You call him phylo.
I'm gonna call up Elian. And unfortunately
for you
unfortunately for you
who
by the way, whatever that guy's name
is, I want to give him the KIP
the KIP award
of courage
to pull out phylo
in a discussion
of the logos is amazing
and one you can take home
you can always take home
everybody we can all take home
that that little bit of Zeno
that little bit of Zeno who said
oleos
esti
ospermaticos
logos to Cosmo
God
is the
spermatic logos
of
the
organization
Boom.
Love it.
Love it.
That's the real stuff.
You get that?
It's a chronic, and that's what Nonas
was trying to tell you last week.
Ahronos, those of you with ears to hear,
I know you picked it up.
Ahronos, love it.
Okay, boom.
Let's bring up our first text of Elian.
This, bring it down again.
Forgot to introduce him properly.
We're talking about, you know,
a little bit after time, Marcus Aurelius.
And Elian comes into the picture,
and this guy is educated, educated, educated.
And as a highly, highly educated person,
his proficiency with Greek is just phenomenal.
They called him, you know, the honey tongued,
because his Greek was so good.
Good for you.
Good for you.
He's adicizing a little bit here.
This is a little bit of second sophistic
for those of you who are into it.
Now, I've worked with this passage with several students.
I'm just gonna give you,
I'm just gonna translate it very quickly,
because we don't have a lot of time.
We want to face it, right, our attention.
Let's go, bring it up.
What's gonna happen?
You know, the bites of the viper
and of other types of snakes.
People say that, you know, we have curatives for this.
We have drugs for this.
And I hear that these drugs are in two forms.
They're either pomata, they're either potions,
or they're hrimata.
They are things that you apply as Christing.
Kai epa oides.
So he goes on and he says, hey, you know, the epodes.
And by the way, Elien, take it down for a minute.
Who is this guy, Elien?
Just for those of you who are interested,
he's kind of, he's writing a work on zoology.
Yeah, he's writing a zoological work.
And the good thing is, is his sources,
which there are a ton of,
we don't necessarily have those surviving anywhere else.
Right, do you see people for a second?
Do you see how big it is?
Do you see how big it is?
We're not looking for that scrap.
We're not looking for the scraps.
Look, somebody threw away an old parchment.
It's got a scrap, a scribble.
We're not looking for that.
We're looking for the stuff that was in the libraries.
We're looking for the stuff
that the people are working with, right?
This is Elien.
You're dealing with a major thinker of the day.
And I know that most of you, and you shouldn't.
Most of you don't know who he is.
Yeah, yeah.
So zoologists, just think zoologists here.
Now we're gonna watch.
Are you ready?
We're getting close.
We're talking about two types of drugs.
We're talking about the drugs that you drink.
Those are the pomata, right?
And then we're talking about the drugs that you heal,
that you inhale,
that you apply otherwise.
And this can mean to the eyes,
it's any other application that you are not swallowing.
If you, there are those you swallow
and those you apply otherwise.
Otherwise, and mainlining.
And when I say mainline, what do I mean historically?
Some of you may absolutely understand this.
And some of you may not.
But you are entering that stream.
You are entering that stream.
You're finding that blood and pushing into the blood.
That's mainlining.
Yes.
Oh, God, that's what Jesus is doing.
It's what Jesus is doing.
And you say, oh my God,
you're gonna show me a text in the alien?
Where Jesus, I'm gonna show you the Christ.
You cannot be Christ without injecting it
right into your veins.
What?
Yes, linguistically.
It's gorgeous.
Bring up the text again.
Are you ready?
Let's keep reading it.
Let's keep reading it.
He says, you know, you can drink it
or you can have it applied as the Christ.
And he says, there are incantations
that are effective at kind of mollifying or softening.
Softening what?
Tonion.
Many of you see that line tonion
because you're working on the Greek and you know.
That's the toxin that they use with the arrow poisons.
When you take this thing and you increase center it,
when it enters directly,
oh my God, there is nothing better, right?
You've got to have a mollifying drug, right?
And he's saying the epodes help.
The incantations are part of it.
You ask yourself, take it down for a second.
Why are these people,
why are these people going through incantations?
You see even straight up in antiquity,
straight up doctoring,
where the doctor, somebody will have broken a limb
and the doctor is repairing the limb,
putting the bone back to try to set the bone.
And while they're doing it, they are incanting.
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
Singing a song while they're doing it.
And the song helps them to reset,
yeah, to reduce the break.
Isn't that great?
That's fantastic.
So the incantations are there
and they help when you've been Christed.
I want you to put up that next,
should we put up that next Greek?
Yep.
I just want you to look at this verb,
and khrio, and khrio, right?
Look at notice at the top, annoying.
What kind of parts are you gonna, annoying?
Look at the second line,
of thalamus, the eyes, right?
We ain't talking about boys in a gym.
We are talking about sending someone
into the world of the Christ.
Oh my God, look at it, look at number two.
Take down the Bible studies, Chewie.
Look at number two, okay?
Just Roman numeral number two, look.
Sting or prick, wait a minute.
To incrise something means to prick.
Yes, yes, poison injected by a sting.
Number two, at the very bottom, to stick in
and they give you the word for the thorn.
Boom, you know what you can do?
You can put this stuff on a thorn.
You can put this stuff on a thorn
and you can get it in.
You can incrise yourself.
You can incrise yourself.
Isn't that fantastic?
Oh my God, Elin, what does he say?
Well, okay, look, we're not done with the drugs yet.
In that quote, just bring it up,
I'll go through it quickly
because I know people gotta run.
Quickly, let's do it, look at this.
He says, look, it's okay.
He says it's okay to hate something
that these snakes that have this power to kill,
to do bad, it's okay.
He says, but there's something worse.
There's a beast that's far worse
and something you're not gonna be able
to guard yourself against
and that is the Gune Pharma Kis.
The Gune Pharma Kis.
What is the, I'm looking for this woman,
like anthropologically, right?
I mean, I hate to, go ahead, take it off.
I hate to blow my cover,
but I'm just a trans-dimensional anthropologist
and I'm looking for this woman
because she is going to help me solve the case
of why Jesus was arrested in a public park
with a naked kid, yelling, I'm not a sex trafficker.
Yes, wow, we're gonna find out.
You misspelled lacedace, by the way.
Nice, nice.
I had to get that little dig in there.
I'm sorry, I can't help it,
but if you're gonna be professional and refute,
bring the professional.
Yeah, love it, love it.
Let's go back to the text.
There's something even more dangerous,
that Gune, that woman who is the Pharma Kis.
He says, for example, Medea and Cersei, right?
And why is that?
You can take it down.
He says, why is that?
Why is that?
That snake is killing you
with its bite.
That snake is killing you with its bite.
It's drugs, boom, direct application.
He said, you know what's even scarier than that?
The women who have developed this science, get this.
They can kill you with a touch.
They can kill you with a touch.
Now, this isn't a mystery initiate devotee
who's writing this.
It's not a priest, right?
It's not someone who's gonna have
some kind of axe to grind.
This is, oops, sorry.
This is a person who is writing about zoology.
And using sources that are telling him,
oh, this plant is that plant.
This animal is that animal.
Yeah, fantastic.
This one's poisonous.
That was the most poisonous.
He says that everybody knows the Egyptian cobra
is the one that you can't stay away from, right?
Our antidotes will work on all of them, but that one.
Yeah, isn't that neat?
How scientific.
If that doesn't turn you on intellectually,
nothing will.
Okay, I wanna give you a couple more texts.
Look, people were asking questions.
I'll be the next text.
People were asking questions.
Why is this significant about the Hebrew
not being there in the society?
I just wanna show you a work.
This is, of course, brought to you by 1840s,
German classical philological scholarship in Leipzig.
Something, those people were smoking something
because the productivity was amazing
and their source work, phenomenal, phenomenal.
Whatever those guys were doing.
Woo, gorgeous.
One of them put together lives of different types of writers.
Now, he put it together in eight books
and each of the books is dedicated to one type of skill.
We have epic poetry, we have lyric poetry,
we have rhetoric, we have tragedy, we have comedy.
Yeah, yeah.
And he talks about all the famous people,
whose works you and I know
because how are you and I educated?
We're not from Florida.
Yeah, we were educated from tiny, tiny, on Homer
and other poets.
That language, when somebody comes to you and says,
I think this about the New Testament
or about the Septuagint, about the Bible.
When they do that, ask them, ask them,
where does it come through Homer?
Because that's the standard grammar.
If you're gonna be in the universe, you better know Homer.
Yeah, love it.
That's why every classical ball,
you just have to take a certain amount of Homer.
Yeah, fantastic.
So I'm not gonna throw you any curveballs, guys.
We're still demonetized, we're not demonetized,
we've never been monetized.
We're not trying to get monetized.
I have nothing to sell you.
There's no merch.
I don't want any chats throwing money.
I appreciate the fact that everybody's got a voice.
Nobody has to attach money to it.
Okay, fantastic.
Hit us with the next, bring that up there.
Here's just an example.
Look, Nicander, he's gonna talk about Nicander.
And my God, man, in each of the field,
there's a few famous people that we all recognize, right?
And then he's just got oodles and oodles and oodles of author
after author, after author, after author.
Realize at the time, there is no Hebrew.
It doesn't exist.
It is not a literary language.
It has died.
And most of the people,
most of the people in Palestine and Judea,
they don't care.
They don't care.
They love Greek, just fine, thank you.
Yeah.
It is always a religiously zealous minority.
Historically, that will come along
to turn the situation to their political favor.
It was in the favor of that religious minority
to revive this dead corpse that was classical Hebrew.
And again, remember, for those of you who want to travel,
I'm not talking about modern Hebrew.
Modern Hebrew is flourishing.
It's flourishing, it's blossomed.
Somehow, they brought life to the language in Israel.
Yes, and it's gonna be happy and healthy.
Happy, classical Hebrew, oh my goodness.
It's a mummified corpse.
It's, oh God, it's terrible.
It's, oh.
So that's why I ask people,
the reason that you're not seeing in Hebrew during the time
is it's dead.
Nobody's writing in Hebrew.
You've been using Greek in the synagogues, right?
Nobody's writing in Hebrew.
So where are you gonna go with the,
where are you gonna go with your sources
if you're gonna be saying I'm expecting
to find some kind of Hebrew link
so that the language can be holy,
the Bible can be correct,
and I can go to heaven or whatever.
Yeah, but that is the joke.
The joke's on you.
There are professionals who laugh
at biblical scholarship, so-called.
And the agenda that it toes.
Julian the Apostate was right.
Nobody, who's an atheist,
and by atheist they were talking about
any of the monists who were saying
there are no gods but blank.
Any of those atheists will corrupt the system.
You cannot have them teach.
What happens?
You get Florida.
You get dark ages.
You get banned things,
and you get people saying this can't be taught,
that can't be taught, right?
Yeah, sign of the times.
Let's hit that text again.
I didn't wanna take this long.
I'm sorry, I value your time,
and I want everybody to get goodies out of this.
So I've got a couple of more.
Let me just hit you with a couple more.
Keep going down.
Here, I just wanted you to see,
here's a couple of names, right?
Who are these people?
Right, they're poets, right?
Well, that's nice.
Epipoios, that's an epic poet, right?
Here's a, has anybody heard of Ischion?
No, you haven't, right?
He's a famous epic poet.
Isn't that nice?
That's gorgeous.
Let's go to the next one.
Right, none of these.
So when you tell me you know antiquity,
you should be quiet.
Because look, here's three Dionysiases.
Oh my God.
Did you know these are sources?
No, there's one of them.
One of them's from Byzantium,
one of them's from Corinth,
and the third one is from Middellini.
Middellini, isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
That's on the island of Lesbos.
That's on the island of Lesbos.
My God, man, you want culture?
Go to a girl's school in Lesbos,
where you've got people like Sappho.
We have no problem finding references to Sappho,
quotes of Sappho.
Did you know that?
Did you know that?
We have no problem,
because she has such a strong reputation.
We're not worried about our sources.
We have established texts, people.
The Bible is written in Greek, the whole thing.
We have established texts.
We have people quoting that Greek Old Testament.
We have them quoting it.
We don't have them quoting Hebrew,
because the Hebrew is defunct.
It's defunct.
Yes.
Look at all these authors.
Give me the next, give me the next.
Look at all these authors here
that I want to introduce you.
Oh, look, we ran across the Sibyls.
For those of you who are interested in the Sibyl,
the Sibyl is listed among the classical authors
within her genre.
She's using Dactylic Hexameter too.
She's using the Hexameter too.
She belongs with the epic poets.
She belongs with them.
Yes, she's the source of that Dactylic Hexameter.
Yeah, so it's sort of, they belong to her,
but let's just see the Sibyl real quick.
What did that say?
I just wanted to bring them about the Sibyl.
They're talking about the Sibyl of Delphi.
What did they call her?
What did they call her for Sibyl of Delphi?
They called her Artemis.
Wait, are you sure that it says that?
Yeah, it turns out that they're calling,
you can take it down,
that they're calling people, gods,
try to grasp this for a minute, break out of the fairy tale,
and try to grasp the fact that there were people
walking around in their civilization
who were considered, dressed as,
and worshiped as gods.
Yeah, yeah, well that is amazing, right?
That, right there, that's something.
When you have been into the mystery,
and you have been through that
pharmacosexual initiation,
you have seen her, you have seen Lady Babylon.
And now you know why Lady Babylon is enemy number one
of yahoo, enemy number one.
Have you ever thought about that?
Why?
Why in the apocalypse?
Why is it the way that Lady Babylon is, is the enemy?
Why?
Yeah, yeah, it's in the blood.
It's in the blood.
If you want to be born again,
if you want that in Christing,
it's gonna have to come through the blood on a thorn.
Yeah, oh I love it, give me a little more,
give me a little more great,
can you give me a little more great?
Let me just throw out a couple more things.
Those are beautiful by the way,
jewey thanks, fantastic.
Yep, anything, there we go.
Hey, I just want you to see here
that this one symbol that is the Chaldean symbol,
he says her name is Sanbethi, right?
Now he says some people say that she is the Ibraia, right?
Some people say that she is the Persis, right?
And this is her real name of power though.
Her real name of power is Sanbethi, yes.
And she comes from that genus
of that holy priest we all know as Noah.
You say Noah?
No, I said Noah.
Before, before you were ever given a Noah,
you had Noah the father of the symbol.
The symbol, yeah, father of the symbol.
How long does she live?
A better question would be does she die?
And who are all the people in history who claim
that she doesn't?
Yeah, are you mainlining?
All right, if you are mainlining that logos,
you've got to get it.
You see why the Christians can't reach it?
Why the Orthodox Jews can't reach it?
Why the Taliban throw an acid in the face of little girls?
You know why they cannot reach that place?
Because their ancestors all worshiped Aphrodite and Bacchus
and they threw it away.
They threw it away for the sake of greed,
for the sake of a possession,
for the sake of 70 virgins.
They threw it all away.
You dishonor Aphrodite.
You fundamentalists, you dishonor Aphrodite
and you hate women as a result.
And how do I know that?
Because I'm just talking history, man.
That's what happens.
It always goes that direction.
Yeah, when you get rid of the elements of Aphrodite
within the cult, you get religions that are misogynistic.
Ta-da, shouldn't be a surprise.
Shouldn't be a surprise.
Now you can go the other direction too.
You can get an Amazonian queen.
You get an Amazonian queen who perhaps has worshiped
as a goddess.
Yeah, have you ever been, let me just ask,
sister heard of frustration?
Have you ever been worshiped?
Yeah, yeah, special dedication to my non-friend
in Nazareth, special dedication.
You saw, you saw everything, your eyes were open
and it was my pleasure to be able to give you that fruit.
That's the power.
That's the power.
Oh, can you feel it?
Can you feel that?
Okay, throw in that last, let's go quick.
These people want, they're like, shut up, I need dinner.
Go, yeah, here, more civil stuff.
Look, more civil stuff.
Great.
Look, I just wanted you guys to notice
this Caldean or Persian symbol, right?
All of these symbols are following that structure
that Medea set up as the queen of Babylon.
Did you see the tunnel?
She built a tunnel under the river.
Can you believe this?
And it's, you know, she had to change
the direction of the river.
She had to waterproof everything.
They had to put up art designs.
Oh my God, it's absolutely gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.
This is the most, this is the greatest gem, Medea.
Let me just say this.
Medea is the greatest undiscovered treasure of humanity.
The greatest undiscovered treasure of humanity.
Yeah, you are the product of her thoughts.
You are the product of her thoughts.
If you are a Christian and you are sitting,
watching Billy Graham with your popcorn,
if you are in church,
if you are going to your synagogue,
to your mosque,
you are all servants of the mind of a Bronze Age woman.
Your religions were created by her.
They are corruptions of what she did.
This is gorgeous, gorgeousness and gorgeosity.
Go to another one.
I hope you don't mind, we didn't invite Philo.
Because if we had Philo sitting here this whole time,
you know what we'd be talking about.
Yeah, yeah, wouldn't be this, let's go.
Yeah, that's okay, here's another Orpheus.
I want to show you, look, there's an Orpheus one.
This is the Thracian one, go to the next one.
And look, there's a bunch of other Orpheus's here.
Yeah, did you even know, like many of us,
many people here, be honest with yourself,
you're studying these mystery religions.
Take it down, you're studying these mystery religions.
You want to know what you're studying.
You want to know, that's what's driving us, right?
You want to know, so that you can say
what Jesus was doing with that naked kid.
You want to know.
And right in the middle of all this, you realize,
oh shit, I didn't know there was more than one Orpheus.
Yeah, it's just a name, brah.
Right, and you mean these other ones or poets too?
Yeah, right, and nobody knows.
Look, we've got fragments from them.
This is fantastic.
Right, Bible scholars, and they never touch this stuff.
Why would they never touch this stuff?
I don't know, I'm asking genuinely,
because I don't know, it boggles my mind.
Whenever I come across a biblical scar
who has no idea about anything outside of the New Testament,
I'm always shocked, I'm like, can you claim really
to be an expert in this language?
If all you've read is one thing out of thousands
upon thousands upon thousands,
there's 400 pages of this text that I'm showing you
with these different authors, different ancient authors.
There's 400 pages of it, and there's two to three per page.
Two to three per page.
My God, did you know there was that many?
There's 500,000 copies.
500,000 scrolls in Alexandria alone.
Yeah, don't think that there aren't books
all over the place, right?
If you are wealthy in antiquity, in Rome, you got scrolls.
You got scrolls, you send your kids to Athens.
Why do you send them there?
It's for the Greek, brah.
It's for the Greek, this Greek can open your brain.
Modern Greek, modern Greek's been enslaved by the church.
Yeah, see what happens, people?
Julian was right, we're gonna lose it.
We're gonna lose everything.
30%, they told me in history.
It's gotta be 30% and kicks over.
Go for it.
Well, a couple more and then we'll,
oh here, I just gave you, yeah.
So, Teddy Hus, I just wanna give you,
this is interesting because who is this writer
of epic poetry, right?
He's got Sotera in his name.
I just wanted you to see this,
he's got Sotera in his name.
But, he's gonna be talking about some pretty cool stuff.
He's writing about the basards, you know,
or otherwise called, he's writing a Dionysiaca.
Wait a minute, what?
Yes, another, you saw, I thought there was only one.
No, no, no, there's multiple, right?
All of a sudden, do you realize how small a view
of antiquity you've been getting?
You mean there are other epics,
other than known us about Dionysus?
Yep, yeah.
You mean the epithets that Jesus is using
as Jesus Christ are all Bacchic epithets?
Yep, you mean hallelujah is a Greek expression?
Yep, yeah, yeah.
You see what you have to do is you have to build.
You have to build your own foundation.
If you don't have one, if all you got sand,
you gotta build a foundation.
You gotta put something, make it work, right?
You can't just start on the sand, right?
It's probably gonna sink anyway, right?
Go somewhere else.
Yeah, take Philo with you, right?
Josephus was a liar.
He was an out and out liar.
It's amazing.
People will believe anything if you write it down.
And of course, what are they all writing in?
Greek.
Anywho, go, go, this is, I'm sorry.
Do that, do that, I think it's too,
I think it's abusing the biblical scholars too much.
Can we get the excessive abusing
the biblical scholars sound?
Do we have that anywhere, Chewie?
Can you key that up?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, he's already dead.
Yeah, exactly, right?
Come on, man, you gotta feel bad for him.
All they've got is a text that's from a defunct language
that somebody propped up and shocked a couple times
with the battery and it twitched.
Right?
Come on, man, I wanna show you a woman.
I wanna show you a woman and this is in response.
This last little bit is gonna be my response to Bart Ehrman.
My response to Bart Ehrman.
Bart, you stepped in it.
You stepped in it, Bart, you know you did
when you said this week
that people in antiquity all thought
that women were inferior to men.
They were not finished creations.
And Bart, you know what you've done, Bart, right?
You've taken a 2000-year period, Bart,
with hundreds of cultures and you smashed them all together
under the power of Aristotle and his misogyny.
You smashed it all together and you did that, Bart,
because I know what you did.
You wiggled out from the generation,
the generation of scholars who were saying,
women did nothing in the ancient world.
They did nothing.
Yeah, they were chattel.
They were chattel.
Sorry, sorry, Bart, but you know as well as I do
or maybe they don't teach you in biblical studies,
but you should know that a generalization like that
about antiquity, you're never,
and there's no generalization that you can prop up, right?
I can walk you over to the Amazonians
who are kicking the Athenians' tails in battle
and tell them, hey, what do you think?
You could tell Medea that, but she wouldn't care
because she's already sending out pithias all over the planet.
Yeah, yeah, you got them as far west as Brittany.
They go beyond the Hesperides, beyond the Hesperides.
Oh my God, oh my God, but that's okay, Bart, Bart,
I know that you can't help it
because there's a certain load of stank
that you have to bear within the discipline.
I get that, but that doesn't mean
that you aren't doing something that is disrespectful
to the muse, right?
Classical philologists, texts, that's what we are, right?
We work with the texts.
We don't dig in the dirt.
We have to, you have to a certain amount,
but we don't dig in the dirt.
We leave that to the archeologists.
We dig through the texts.
We dig through the texts.
I wanna get you this woman, bring her in, finally, somebody.
Is this she that I was looking for just a minute ago
and you look at the top and the Greek students,
look at that, Hypatia.
We're gonna be talking about Hypatia.
She's one of the authors that, you know, as mentioned
and in this source.
And I just want you to know, let's put it up there.
I wanna translate it for him because, oh yeah, this is,
yeah, she's the daughter,
the Hypatia is the daughter of the geometrician Theon, yeah?
And she was a, sorry, he's a philosopher in Alexandria
and she too, it was a philosopher.
Yeah, and famous, was known by many people.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she was the wife of, no, no, no, sorry.
She grew to her acme.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
She grew to her acme in the kingship of Arcadius.
Okay, cool.
And what did she do?
She wrote a notes.
She wrote notes or a synopsis of these mathematical works
of diophanties.
Okay, cool, cool, cool.
And something on astronomical.
Yeah, something about astronomy.
Yeah, and also Apollonius, right?
Apollonius, she wrote again some notes on that.
And what did she do?
She was killed by the Alexandrians and her body, right?
Was grossly maltreated, cut up, spread through the city.
Yeah, and she suffered this.
He says, duto de peponte.
She suffered this, why?
Dia phonon, phonon, phonon, you atheists won't understand this.
Phonon, you atheists won't understand this.
Phonon, give me the next, give me the Greek for phonon.
Yeah, what is it?
Ill will or malice, yeah, little bit of jealousy.
Little bit of jealousy, little bit of grudging feeling.
Why?
Why did they grudge this woman?
What could she possibly begrudge them?
Bring it back up.
Well, it's because of her wisdom.
Most especially, you know,
because of the incredible astronomical knowledge.
Take it down.
What a bunch of dogs.
What a bunch of, I can't even say.
I love dogs too much.
Yeah, I don't know what kind of animal acts that way.
I don't, but I do know that that animal
is traditionally carrying a cross
or an eight pointed star
or a crescent moon.
And usually somebody's getting enslaved in the process
and it's typically women.
Those sisterhoods of the frustration,
I know you, I know where you are.
Yeah, yeah.
Hypatia, what beauty, right?
You notice I didn't read to you.
There's descriptions of her
and how she looked and all that stuff.
All right.
But what was beautiful about Hypatia
is that her understanding of the cosmos
was so superior that it made people hate her for it.
People who followed Yahoo.
Yeah.
When you take a polytheistic society
in which justice thrives,
when you take that society
and give a third of the people power over everyone else,
that third can turn that society upside down.
They don't have to be a majority.
And that's exactly what the Christians did.
And what the Christians haven't taken over the Romans, right?
Having taken over the empire
and having mismanaged it so poorly
that it was falling apart.
Yeah.
Yeah, more additional war.
Nice.
Good job.
Having done all of that,
there had to be built some kind of facade of scholarship.
And that scholarship came through the Masoretic sect
which provided that source that we didn't have.
It finally solidified that this language
is the language of God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how history is built and that's where you are.
But we're going back to that original.
Tonight I had a couple.
I think I had one or two more things,
but I wanted you to see,
I wanted us to end with the resurrection of that vampire
that Baudelaire is talking about.
Yeah, she that Baudelaire,
who Baudelaire is talking about.
Yeah.
These are the texts, people.
If you would like to refute,
if you would like to critique,
or as some of the comments said, to debunk.
If you would like to debunk any of those texts,
feel free about it.
Yeah, go ahead.
But if you notice tonight, guys, all I did,
all I did was bring you texts.
This is what Bible studies will die from
when classes stand up,
master those texts and bring you the beauty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the way.
We build that museum.
We build that museum.
Thank you guys for giving me so much time tonight.
I'm not going to take any more of your time.
It's an honor.
Hail Satan.
There down the fences that fence us all in.
Fences created by such evil men that we could.
There down the fences that fence us all in.
Maybe we could walk together again.
Just maybe we could walk together again.
