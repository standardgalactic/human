Unfortunate reality
Deadly as you know
Poison took the touch
Rubba dubba dub
The sea gave up its dead
Overflowing cup
Hades extra love
Thanos and Athena
Dancing with Numbadia
The voice is in the wind
Hear now why you listen
Q-Sip Numbadia
Shouldn't mess with this
My girl is poisonous
Purple rain and kiss
Envira, that's my chick
Drake and fandom drip
Fangrippin' her lip
Catherine of the wheel
Athena, Numbadia
Purple triple beamer
Sticky icky creeper
The muse dance with Mia
Sibyline Numbadia
Havoc's seen the dreamers
My girl is poisonous
Hit you with a kiss
Drake and fandom drip
Fangrippin' her lip
Hit you with a kiss
Drake and fandom drip
Fangrippin' her lip
Clio
We're gonna see her tonight
And I'm gonna take you in
As the ship is warming up now
And as we're just going through
The space time
Boom, right through that wave
We're gonna go
And I'm gonna bring you to the
Apocalypse
I'm gonna bring you to the
Apocalypse
There's a reason that we've been
Initiating Apocalypse
Tonight
I have something for you
Remember
We work
For the devil
And when you work for the devil
You cannot take money
You cannot take money
Yeah, that's the way it is
What I'm going to give you
In 100%
Genuine reality
Are some words that you have been
Ode
These are the words of your
Awakening
So that you
Might not fear
That second death
Fantastic, do you hear my cult
Terminology tonight?
Everybody is getting ready to get
Off a ship
You gotta get your cult
Terminology going, right?
I don't want you shelling up at
The doors tonight
To watch the ceremony
And to be saying things that
People are looking at you like
Has anybody initiated that goofball?
Right, how does she get in here?
Initiate her
Oh, God
Right, let's go
People, when we go in tonight
We gotta be crisp
We gotta be strong
The forces around there
We need that science
And reason to drive us home
Just as sharp as it can be
Just as sharp
No BS tonight
No ideas
No theories
Just ghosts
We're bringing them back from
The dead baby
We're bringing them back from
The dead Howard
Oh, yeah, come on
Let's jump on the almond spaceship
Yes, of course, right?
You can't help it
You can't help it
It's the quantum reality
You can't help
But be carried
Through time and space
When you're doing the necromancy
Let's go
Let's go tonight
Thank you for coming
It's very important to me
To be diligently protective
Of your time
So I want to give you everything
Just pow
Open up the doors
Let's go out, people
It's here
I want to bring you up first, though
What do we do?
The star charts are screwed up tonight
I need to give you the third
I did this on purpose, Chewie
I did it on purpose
I'll have to show you the gift
Just a minute
Everybody off
I'll show you the gift in five minutes
Just gather your stuff
And let's go
Hit it
Where are we?
We're in the beginning
Of the apocalypse
Apocalypse
Yesu Christu
Heine edukenaultoi hothios
You know what we're bringing tonight?
We're bringing the apocalypse
Of the Christ
Of the Christ
Are you ready?
This is for us
This is for us
Give me the next one
What's going to happen?
That was the opening
Here is the word
For those of you who are taking the Greek
I want you to appreciate it
Apocalypse
There is no dash
They're just trying to show you
Where the prefix is
And where the root is
Et cetera, et cetera
This is a hiding
Oppo is taking that hiding away
You are bringing something to light
When you stand in that mystery temple
It says, know yourself
This is the revelation
Are you ready?
Give me the next one
We got to go right in
Watch here, people
Here is the apocalopto
Okay, fine
To disclose and to reveal
I just want you to see
I'm not lying to you
Hit me with the next one
Mm, fantastic
What is an actual apocalopsis
If you turn it into a noun
I want you to notice
It's an uncovering of something
It can be uncovering of different things
Tonight, I'm going to uncover
For you the right
Are you ready?
Look at that second line
Especially of divine mysteries
Oh, my God
Mystery, what is a mystery?
Hit them
They don't know this
Hit them
Musterion
Musterion
Here it is
Here it is
Love it, people
The Greek people
We're taking the Greek right now
Reading through Unit 1
Mu, Upsilon, Sigma, Tao, Eta, Rho, Yoda
Omicron, Nu
Musterion, Accent over the Eta
Oh, God
Isn't it gorgeous?
Just to say it
Musterion
Musterion
What is that?
Musterion
Well, really
Look at the parentheses at the top
Here's our musterion
Look at the parentheses
That's what they're hiding from you
Right?
That's what really counts
Those two words and parentheses
Particularly the second one
Mueo
Why?
Because I told everybody
Everything is coming from the verb
In ancient Greek
That's the verb
And what is that word
What is that verb going to do?
I'll show you in a second
But look here
Mystery of secret right
Mystery of secret
The mystery is in the plural
And then I want you to see
At the end of that line
The mystery is first in Heraclitus
Who, you say?
The hell is Heraclitus
Oh, I love this
Bring out the dead
Bring out the dead
Come on, Heraclitus
Oh, vigorous
Vigorous butte scenes
Will be on display
It's fantastic
Who is Heraclitus?
He is a pre-secratic philosopher
Who blows people's minds
I told you
I told you
Give him some images
Making him crazy
I told you
That there is this power
Of ancient Greek
In the right position
Which is in your brain
That power can bring itself out
In the logos
This guy was flying on the logos
Remember, remember
He's the guy who says things
That nobody really understands
Nobody really understands
It's too much
Heraclitus
And you say, wait a minute
Why am I bringing the revelation
With Heraclitus?
Because this is the place
That the theologians cannot go
They cannot track the language
And that's what we're here to do
The Tower of Babel only works
If Mother Greek says so
You're gonna love it tonight
Watch this
Give me the next one
Oh, God, it's sizzling
It's sexy
Sexy mute
Chewy, get us to there
Come on, get us to there
Wait, was that it?
Are you sure?
Look, I wanted you to see here, people
Look at this
Look at what I do for you
Look at what I do
This is a text from the 19th century
It's Galen
It's Galen
Look at how beautiful that paper is
That paper is a couple hundred years old
You know, when that stuff is new
It looks just like this
Isn't that gorgeous?
Look at how it doesn't age
It's immortal, baby
They made immortal paper
In the 1820s to the 40s
Oh, God, let's go
Look at the people
I said mystery, right?
So I wanted to take you to a place Dan isn't?
You know, this is just a place
A place to dance and the kips to the world
They can't go because they're training
You know, it just falls
It just falls a little short
Right? You know, there's samurai
And then there are people who stay there, samurai
And how do you know when they get in an arena?
You can see
It's skill
Watch this, people
This is Galen
That's in the very middle of the page
In the new paragraph
This is Ale, an odunos to musterion
Not only is the word Christos
Or Christ a drug term
But in antiquity
They are so cheeky
That they name powerful
Compound drug
The mystery
Oh, my God
Somebody would tell me
Some scholar somewhere
Ah, right on it
Backside
Some scholar somewhere
Is going to say
There is no association between a mystery and drugs
And you want to squeeze
There are little heads like this
Like just like that
Right? Why?
Oh, God
The gospel is a drug term
Salvation is a drug term
She dusts his robe
Oh, God
Here we go
Go back to the sources
Bring up the next one
There was your drug formula, by the way
For those of you, your Greeklings
Who are reading and studying
I recommend that you go to that text
Just flash that text up
It's got a recipe for the drug
That you call the mystery
Oh, that's fantastic
Past the bull's blood
Let's go
You didn't know they had this kind of stuff, did you?
But they did
Here's the verb
To initiate into the mysteries
Now, I want to make a point here
Dan McClellan, the world-renowned theologian
Bible scholar
Just all around, you know, champion
Champion, did you see the plaques on his walls?
Oh, my God, he's got plaques
Woo!
Dan McClellan says, amen
Merely went to the bottom of the definition
Okay, now, what does that show?
It shows poor inadequate training
He's not trying to be this way
He's being this way because his trainers
Didn't have the skill level with the language
That they could raise him up to the level
That he can use a basic tool
Like a classical Greek lexicon
Yeah, so if you track the word
Through this passage, you see how it's set up?
All in blue, you've got all the Greek and blue
Who are the mysteries about?
Gives you all the different mysteries
And all the different contexts that you've got
And then you get to definition number two
It says generally to teach, you're an instruct
Now, if I jump down and I choose definition number two
It's not because that has nothing to do
With the rest of the word
If you track these passages
You will see what does it mean to Mueo
Yeah, it does mean to educate, to instruct
To a level during an initiation
Yes, yes, Dan
The fact that it's the bottom has nothing to do with it
Right, the idea of the initiation and instruction
We are pulling those out artificially
When you say Christ, you say apply a drug
Drug application, it's what you're saying
It doesn't matter that you can't recognize it, Dan
It's still in the word
Roots have power
And what these great, the classical lexica
That have been edited
You don't say written, you say edited
Those are fantastic
Now, if you go online
And you try to pull down a lexicon of the New Testament
You are going to find the most deranged, laughable jokery
Those definitions are going to be sizzling
With the spice of theology
And they're not going to be good lexica
You don't need the scholar interfering with the evidence
We're just investigators
And when you walk into that crime scene as a theologian
You urinate all over the floor
Do you know what you just did?
You just destroyed all our DNA evidence, you bonehead
Nice job, it's contaminated
The whole scene is contaminated
No court in the country would take this evidence
That is what Judaism Christianity did
To classical history
And it's why Julian the emperor said
Who we call the apostate
It's why Julian the emperor said
You can't allow the monist to do this
To your education
To all of your writings
They are actively burning down libraries
One of the things people don't realize is that monists
Like Christians in their earliest stages
One of the activities that they did on a regular basis
Was burn down libraries
Burn down libraries
Destroy monuments
Destroy statues
Destroy justice
Take her down, we're atheists
We don't follow your gods
We're monists
You have to understand that real pressure is in antiquity
Hit the next one
Let's go to the, this is going to get good
Here's salvation
People don't realize that salvation
Soteria is a health state
It's a state of health
Soteria, hit the next one
Soteria, I want to fly through these
Till we get to our promise
Because I had a gift for everybody tonight
It's coming, it's coming
Don't you hate going on a date
And sitting down for dinner
And you know, there's no gift there
What kind of clown are you?
You know what I mean?
Come on man, get some
You know, some
Eat some lettuce or something
I don't know
Deliverance
What is that deliverance from?
It's a deliverance from disease
It's a deliverance from imbalance
Because that is what is created
When you have symptoms of something
Whether it's mental or physical
Your diseases are all from imbalance
Now, this is the ancient Greek physician talking
The person who's the healer
The great physician
This is that side of the cult mystery
It's very medically oriented
You've got to restore the balance
Blow that up again, Chewie
Let me make sure that we...
A means of safety, a way of returns
Look at number two
Keeping something safe, right?
Fantastic
Give me the next one
So, salvation
We all need salvation, right?
And how are we going to get it?
Well, watch what Peter says
Pay attention, he says
Finish, finish off your telos
The completion of your faith
Because that is the salvation
The soteria of your psyche
All right, now I'm going to introduce you
I'm about to give you the gift
But then I'm going to introduce you to angels
Real angels, are you ready?
Are you ready?
They're going to give us salvation
Like you've never seen it
Give me the next one
Okay, one more for the gift
Yeah, okay, give me the next one
The next one's a gift
This is just...
He's explaining who he is
That's nice
Thank you very much
Here's the gift
Are you ready?
This is what's unique
And this is something that Christians will not understand
About their own texts, right?
This is why if you talk to a modern-day Christian
It doesn't matter if Protestant or Catholic
It doesn't matter if it's evangelical or Methodist
It doesn't matter
You talk to them about this
And they will give you a distortion
That's laughably bad
Because they're working off King James
Newer in a national version
They're working off Anglo-Saxon crappery
That's the problem
And here's the secret
I'm going to give you a secret about seminarians
Okay, take this down and brainwash
And then we'll bring it back
When I worked in seminary
I picked up certain ways
I picked up the vibes
Of the way that theologians, Bible study scholars
The way that pastors and priests
I picked up a way that they follow
And one of the ways they follow is
They say that they use Greek
But they don't
That's number one
Number two, they rely upon faith
And you say, well, no
Wake up
They rely upon faith when they're exercising
Their reason
When they are reading a text
They use a theological filter
To see the words
And what I did as a seminary instructor
Is to take off those blind folds
To take off those glasses
Those rose-colored, theological-colored glasses
It's not a pretty thing at all
But it taints
So here, we're getting the raw naked text tonight
That's what classes do
It's like an autopsy
We're not there to bond with the corpse
We're there to figure out what happened to it
Right?
If I am a, if I am a monist
The logos
The logos is that text
Do you see?
In antiquity, in the original mystery religions
That preceded Christianity
From which Christianity developed
And used all of their vocabulary
Words like Christ, words like gospel
Words like salvation
In all of those earlier, in all of those earlier forms
Of the mystery
The terms are being set
Right?
When we get a Christ
We know what that Christ is
It's not like people would look at you
When Jesus walked around
He's the Christ
Right?
Here in the opening of the apocalypse
It's the apocalypse of the Christ
It's not like people would scratch your head
And say, what is that?
What is that?
Right?
Everybody knows what that is
The theologian can't see those realities
Because over his vision
And I have known one female theologian
She was quite reasonable
Typically over a theologian man's eyes
Or this pride
This excessive smugness
And here's the secret
That can pop their reality
They really don't work with the evidence
They really don't
And when you bring the evidence to them
It's, you know, embarrassing
It's embarrassing
And I learned this
I learned about this defense
This theology
Never get into an argument
Satanic congregation
Don't get into an argument
They mean nothing
And they will always win
Right?
It's already done
Their mind is already settled
I'm telling you
I have been there
I have had that VR on
That, that monest VR
And I have participated
I have sucked the souls
Of those who were downtrodden
I've given them the hope of Christ
And the redemption of the blood of Christ
I have shown them that
I have caused tears
Do you know what it's like
To suck the tears of somebody
Who suddenly comes to the psychic realization
That if they don't believe this stuff
They're going to hell
Yeah
Oh, you thought the whole love thing?
Nobody comes to Jesus Christ because of love
No
Conversions take place
When people see
That you're going to put them in hell
Yeah
Listen up
Are you going to hell?
Fantastic
You want to bet?
People are like
No, that's not the way
Let's give them the gift
Let's give them the gift
Are you ready?
Should we punch them with a gift?
Everybody say
Satanic congregation
Visitors tonight
Who are coming
And there are 633 of you
And I appreciate everyone
By the way
That reminds me
Neil wanted me to say
That this is the 666th year
After something important
I think I've forgotten now
It's something to do with apmonious
Didn't it?
Or no, was it play-thon?
I'm not sure
I think it was play-thon
Yeah, talk to Neil
He's into the Renaissance now
That guy is totally, totally drunk
On the Renaissance now
I love it
Talking to him is like
Yeah?
Yeah?
Give me some of that
I love that
What he's on?
I love it
Okay, ready?
Macarius
Here's your gift
Here's your gift for the evening
This is why we came
Set the mood to the date
Macarius
Ho!
Ana guinoscon
Caioi acuontes tus logos
Teis profiteas
Now, I'm going to stop there
Because this says
And I'm bringing this to you
Congregation, are you ready?
Blessed is the one who reads out this prophecy
And blessed are those who hear it
They're going to guard everything in it
Now is the time
Isn't that?
Hear the words
The words of Amun
Isn't that nice?
Now is the kairos
Now is the kairos
Do you know what the kairos is
To the great physician?
It's the point at which the treatment
Will bring the cure
If you don't find the kairos
That's it
You're doomed
Second death is for you
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy your death
Are you ready?
It's okay
We're here at the cult
And the cult is going to show us
How to go through the death
And come back to life
It's crazy, it's crazy
Can you see it?
You know what Jesus is wearing
At this point in the game?
He's wearing a lady's bra
It's beautiful and golden
Why is he wearing a lady's bra?
Because he's the morning star
Do you have problems with that?
Do you see him?
Jesus, let me give the...
I'm sorry
Where's the shame on me?
Shame on you Amun
For not letting the Christians know
That the first time you see your dude
Come back
He's going to be wearing a lady's bra
Where's he going to be wearing the lady's bra?
On his breasts
That's what the text says
The apocalypse is the revelation
Of Jesus Christ
Wearing a woman's bra
Why?
Because he's the morning star fool
Learn how things are going
Okay, let's go
Trevor, you darn traitor
He's the best character
Who would...
Oh, the other...
Those are idiots
The other ones
I agree
Trevor, it's the way to go
It's the way to go
Go!
Watch what's happening, people
Where is all this coke coming from?
It's coming from somebody's mouth
And their mouth is athana too
Right?
Their stoma is athana
It's got...
Wait, is that the root for Athena?
Yes, it is
It is the root for Athena
And what is that immortal mouth
That deathless mouth?
It is that which breathes the spirit
Apepnelsa
Apepnelsa athana to stomatos
That is the divine mouth
Of she who founded the mysteries
This text that I just showed you
Is Pindar
Now remember, according to
Pastors, preachers, the theologians, the teachers
You cannot take what a Greek does
And apply it to what a Christian does
Why?
Because they live in bubbles
History, according to
Honest teaching
Is a fairy tale
Where some people live in bubbles
They keep them insulated from everything around them
And that's how the...
That's how life is
That's too bad if you don't understand that
Faith, faith, faith, faith, faith
Right?
Here's your unfortunate reality
Your unfortunate reality is
That the language can't sustain that
Language is universal
The forces that are acting on language
They don't care that your neighbor is a different religion
They don't care
Yeah, that's why language
Through science overpowers all of your BS
Oh, can you feel it tonight?
People feel that
This is a temple of reason, baby
It's a temple of reason
Those words that I just showed you
That's what comes out of the founder's mouth
Who is the first Christ
She was a woman, they called her Medea
The root is to heal of her very name
To heal and to rule
Oh, my God, isn't it gorgeous?
Oh, hit the...
Oh, yeah, hit the...
That's a beautiful image, Chewie, by the way
Thank you, Chewie
For all your beautiful, beautiful images
Chewie takes a lot of her time
To bring you these gorgeous, gorgeous images
And they all, of course, are packed with the goods
Do you know what this says?
This is the divine logos
The divine word of Medea
Right?
This is that epos
Now, when you take the word logos
And the Christians say, it means word, word, word, word, right?
It means reason, it means accounting
It means a reckoning, right?
And it means word
And you say, wait a minute
Dan said, if I pick one of these later definitions, I'm off
You mean one Greek word
Can mean word and reason and reckoning
All at the same time
Yes, now, for those of you who are growing
Take those three concepts from your Anglo-Saxon brain
Use the force
There we go
Take those concepts
And put them together
Word
Word, you got it?
You understand?
Word
Now, take reason
And combine word and reason
What kind of offspring do you get from word and reason?
Now, take that offspring
And combine that with reckoning
Reckoning as in an accounting of something
Reckon your existence
Logos
Do you know where this stuff is coming from?
When John says in the beginning was the logos
It's coming from this guy, Heraclitus
Yeah, among others
He's one of the people who bats it around
Who develops the context
I mean the content of the word
As it grows
Imagine that
Now, you cannot do this with Hebrew, right?
The level that you have got ancient Hebrew
For those of you, ancient Hebrew with its 8,000 words
Is compared to Greek with 1.5 million now
Estimated by the TLG
Holy mack
You can't get to this level
That you've got reason
You've got accounting
It's just not enough elements, right?
There's not enough balls and sticks to put together
The molecules that you need
Complex molecules
If you only have 8,000 basic units
You can't do anything with that
I'm telling you a third grader has a 3,000
I mean a 3 year old has a 3,000 word capacity
8,000 words is like his big sister
Alright, maybe she's in the fourth, fifth grade maybe
I don't know, I wouldn't put it that way
Have you seen that stuff?
And don't think that it's just an artifact of ancient Hebrew
The Oskar and the Umbria are the same way
Gilgamesh is the same way
Everybody, the epic of Gilgamesh
Brilliant!
Yeah, if you're in kindergarten
Have you read that thing?
It's only so much you can do
Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh
Boy, if you're impressed by Gilgamesh
I've got some stuff that will cause you to be very depressed
Very depressed
The first thing it's gonna do is it's gonna depress the hell out of you
Because you and I are so stupid
So stupid!
Alright, how can I say that with absolute authority?
How can I say that? People say
You're a genius! Bullshit!
Oh, I shouldn't have said that
Now, it's not genius
I know who I am
And I know Nemesis
Yeah, and that gives me a real honorable perspective on the world
I have seen people who are geniuses
I have read Sappho
I've seen the glory of her own music
She made her own meter
Dudes at Oxford are trying to figure it out right now
To reconstruct it
Isn't that gorgeous?
What a genius! That's genius
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna cheat a little bit tonight
And I'm gonna give you what the muse has given me
And you're gonna think, oh, that's...
No, it's not...
It's a gift, people
Do you want to be...
Do you want to be blessed?
You'll listen and you'll guard
You'll listen and you'll guard
And who are you doing it for?
The Despoina, everybody in Greek
Despoina Colchon
Yeah, that Queen of Colchis
Queen of Colchis
Whose mouth is immortal
The original Christ
Was a woman
And her name was medicine
Oh, God
Isn't that the most beautiful thing?
Think about reality for a minute, people
Think of what you've been showing with Jesus
And the dude in the heart
Ouch! Thirsty!
Sabachthon!
And boom!
He's dead, resurrected
Think of all of that
And realize that none of that
Would have been possible
Without the woman who figured out the drugs
And how it is that we can kick you
Into a state of death
And bring you back
And you can have a completely different understanding
Of what your existence is
That's why the second death
Has no sting
Because you've been there
You've seen
And if you did it through the mystery
You were able to bring back
That which will enable you
To live anew
If I hadn't done it, Cicero said
If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be the same person
I wouldn't be the same person!
No!
It's gorgeousness and gorgeousity
I love it, I love it
Bring up the next one
That's the last one that we did
Okay, here it comes, people
Are you ready for some Heraclitus?
Here we go
The apocalypse says, John
To the seven churches in Asia
Right, and then there's a greeting
And it's raining peace and grace to you
You know, now we get the phrase then
Apohon kaiho ain kaiho erchomenos
That is formulaic
From the one who is and was and will be
Now you thought, you Christians you thought
Okay, this is ours, right?
This has got to be
Because we're talking about Yahoo
And we're talking about the Old Testament
As you call it
And this is one of his phrases
The one who is and was and will be
Sorry, Heraclitus
Heraclitus
Heraclitus
Close the door
Close the door
Now, people like Dan, the theologians
Who want to take you into the back alley
Into the mental darkness of confusion
They'll tell you, you can't compare Heraclitus
To Jesus Christ
They can't be using the same
Yeah, they can
Yeah, they can
Just like you can use your neighbor's expressions
That's called language, bruh
Go
What is happening here?
He's the one who's coming
What is he doing?
And look at the last line
There are these what?
There are these seven spirits
That are before his throne
Did you know the Holy Spirit was divided into seven?
What is that Holy Spirit doing there?
Look, the editor here
Even was so guilty
About not recognizing the Holy Spirit
That he capitalized
This is Nestle and Allen
That he capitalized
Pnellmaton at the bottom
Just so you would know
We're talking about the spirit
But this one is in seven forms
And I hold seven stars in my hand
Give me the next one
Here's the original people
This is Heraclitus
And what does he say?
He says
You hear the musteria?
An i erosti
Muue un tai
Muue un tai
We bring out a little bit of that daguilla
Yeah, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
You're going to be surprised
He says the mysteries
That we currently understand
These things are practiced
In a way that is unholy
in a way that is unholy drugs sex christ drugs sex christ
unholy what does it say underneath that give me the very next one i'm going to move down
you're going to be surprised who did you think was associated with salvation
who did you think i'll use it in a minute who did you think was associated with salvation
right if i'm going to translate this is number 34 if they do not
what if they do not what if they do not bring the hymn and the procession to diagnosis along
with the song and celebration of the i do you i see what is that i do on means
private parts you mean we hymn the private parts in barkic religion yes and what is it
what does it say it then goes on to say and what what do they do they put people into mania
and they put them into the lanayan ecstasy wait a minute these are drug terms right yes
these are cult associated terms that indicate a change in mental behavior a change in mental
perception a change in an understanding of reality
okay um what does plutaric says at the bottom he says hey on ox lord lord of the oracle that is
in delphi he speaks right and what happens oh i'm sorry i'm sorry he doesn't speak and he doesn't
hide but he say my name he signifies he seals he seals and signifies that's what the lord of
the oracle does and remember the first jewish religious structure is a telestarian it's an
oracle producing tent this is talking about the origins of everything that is
judaism everything and in turn what christianity developed marvelous did you know judaism and
christianity i don't know if judaism and christianity would like to be would like to
know this about themselves but they were born from the same parents
isn't that neat isn't that neat i don't know if everybody would like that or not
but um whether you like it or not they're codependent right and when we have people translating
greek texts into hebrou just to say we've got original hebrou texts the christians have to
prop that up right or else they both fall short right and the pagans were just just no just whatever
don't try to tear that on the government we don't care give me the next one
boom lastly what is he oh no there was a there was a message and there we go watch this what is
plutarx say plutarx the priest by the way mm-hmm what are you apollo you're one who neither speaks
nor do you hide but you signify you seal now watch this go to the next one why does that
matter you think oh this stuff is not there oh before we get there one more one more we'll
see the signifying a second but watch what happens i'm just going to translate this for the one and
you see the two daggers in that first line after the number six those two daggers mean a something
goofy and it's a little bit hard to um to translate it right but there for the one who is they will be
raised again to become guardians guardians of the living and of the dead
oh okay that was heraclitus people if you want to understand the apocalypse and you have not read
pre-socratic philosophy you're going to miss maybe 60 percent of the vocabulary right away
you're not even going to know what that vocabulary is for we are squarely sitting in a mystery
initiation we're in the cult and these words this is the evidence of the crime scene
let's do it let's do it it's too bad the theologians don't ever catch up but they don't typically
they don't um it's the faith thing right it's the same reason sisters of frustration never become
fulfilled it's the faith it's the faith and you do it because of your fear you're afraid of hell
but watch what's going to happen to hell i'll show you what we're going to do to hell are you ready
give me the next one watch this and uh um witness yeah who is just jesus christ look at the second
line he's that firstborn what is he the firstborn of now you think about the he's the firstborn of
god right no no he's not he's not theologically that may match what you'd like but he is not he is the
the only born of god am i reaching yeah not yet it'll come it'll come we'll get there um
sorry did you set that when you can't okay let's go what is he he's the firstborn ton necron
the you hear you know necro in there and you know it has to do with dead necrophilia man necron
corpses right people who have deceased who have died he's the firstborn of the dead did you know
that was jesus christ's title it was his cult title firstborn of the dead of course he had to
resurrect right because he's the firstborn of the dead and what else king of these kings right of
course he is give me the next one that word that word is very important and you cannot dismiss it and
say uh the cults are using the same terms uh but the christians yeah something's different you know
think about christianity this way this is how christians see their own history right um
gaius woke up one morning and went and listened to a preacher and maybe it was peter right right
after he killed ananias and sapphira for their money and he's sitting out there listening to him
and he's like oh this stuff really makes sense and i don't want to go to hell so i'm gonna i'm
gonna follow this to wherever it goes now all of my words are not going to be what they were before
i am not going to use pagan ideas i am not going to use pagan words magically i am going to speak
those pagan words but they will have christian meanings because of my faith is that what you
want you want faith here come here come here you're going to hell you're going to hell
what's happening give me the next one i think i've taken us into a different place
is there a dimensional rift somewhere in here
hmm and what are we now we're priests man we are priests glory and power into the ions of ions says
the christian into the ions of the ions do you even know what that means do you think the person
sitting there in church this weekend ho ho ho making their symbols feeling their prayers oh
jesus forgive me these three times this week i saw patty next door oh god i wish you wouldn't wear
what she's wearing oh it's the spirit of the devil can you forgive me lord jesus you know
they're praying like that right right um and do you think that they understand what the expression
does dan i challenge you i challenge you dan what does it mean into the ions of ions dan will say
from his seminary training oh that's the word for eternal like eternal life dan dan and all you
theologians out there what the heck does it mean to say into the eternities can you really have a
plural eternity isn't eternity already everything how can you have two everything's isn't the one
everything also the other everything when you say eternal life when you walk into that church today
and that preacher is up there that misogynist guy is up there and he's like oh you need to repent
you need to repent of your crimes because you are the Sodom and Gomorrah of the modern world
you need to repent praise jesus he'll forgive you all your sodomistic ways
Gomorrah tendencies you got them not me right um that person do you think that person really
understands the concept of a plurality of ion i don't think so but you as an initiate
you have ionic vision you know what your completion is you've experienced your
completion and thanks to that christ the first person who was ever referred to as having
been a christ thank you diogenes for showing us this not diogenes um diodorus syculus thank
you diodorus who by the way is continues about a hundred years before jesus yeah so the terminology
is there and he's referring to the first christ and it turns out it's the woman who gave us salvation
whose name means medicine
she is the prototype and that's why jesus is now wearing her golden bra do you see
the monism of judaism and the monism of christianity are replacements of a sacred
feminine voice i'll say that one more time the monism of judaism the monism of christianity
are the direct offspring of lady babelon now you understand why they don't want to come out
of the closet now you understand what happens what happens when your world is tipped upside down
you don't worry you're disoriented you just have to accept breathe breathe the reality take a breath
breathe the reality give it give me the next one give me the next one what is
it's not working too forget about it i'm just gonna have to exist in this zone of blueness
yeah this is into the ions of ions let's go on people are like you know what i need to climax
here i need some kind of crescendo to something that oh we got the purple bag give it to me hey
pay attention he's coming in the clouds now that's what you know people would say what the
it's a kind of a nice picture they'll draw it with jesus and he's oh he's in the clouds
right and he's coming it doesn't say in the clouds though it says with the clouds
says with the clouds in all fairness i'll let you theologians figure that out but when you're
surrounded by clouds every eye can see him and especially those who pricked him who wait what
those who pricked him they put the people theologians will say oh it's referring to crucifixion
no it's not no it's not there's no crucifixion in this word there's no crucifixion give me the
next one give me the next one there is no crucifixion in this word what is in it oh here's the clouds
here's the clouds let's go on from the clouds look at that the bottom one is nice the alchemical
sublimate isn't that neat call those clouds ah didn't i here is the verb that it's from people
kente oh and it's just got an intensifier on the front of it so it's like really really kente oh
and what do you do when you kente oh something you sting it you sting it do you remember paul
what does paul have he's got that stinging in his sox oh my flesh pastor please jesus christ save me
save me pastor from this stinging flesh he asked god three times give it to me this dude paul
who is immune to viper venom ask god three times please don't let me continue to do this and god
said to him shut up my grace is sufficient my strength is multiplied in weakness
ostenea is the word in greek in weakness when you go under you will find ostenea
you will be unable to move and this is necessary to bring you to death
do you see why god allowed paul to continue
there was a great city in antiquity called thebes some of the some of the best things
in the world came out of thebes like the worship of Dionysus and the grave of his mother
the son of god yeah yeah and where did that brilliance come from came from baskets they carried
around with serpents and medical applicators for rectal administration of drugs do you know
who founded the city of thebes
was a singer and he did it with the teeth of the dragon the teeth of the dragon
the teeth of the dragon are what you need to enter into the mystery you must be stung and
that is why yahoo's grace is sufficient please please yahoo take this away from me take this
boy cup away from me nevertheless not my will but yours be done that city was founded through
those practices that involved the seven stars that i hold in my hand
if you are ever if you are ever on the verge of death hold up the serpent
raise up the serpent undertake the work of the serpent
you'll drink that death inducer says jesus and it will do nothing to you
do you know what jesus the one product was that jesus christ endorsed in the bible
it's not any sort of chariot it's not any sort of accounting abacus
it's not any sort of drugs that you can buy in the roman marketplace
the one thing he endorsed was a drug that only the mystery initiates will have
experienced these are people who were born again and jesus christ said you will use these drugs
and they will not hurt you okay what are you doing if you come over to my place and i've
got my 12 children and we're doing our initiations we're oh apostles are children right students
anyway um i say children they can be teenagers too so um you know somewhere in that range
students and um if i'm there with my 12 students maybe i'm washing their feet
so i've already taken off my clothes and um the little towel that i wrapped around my private
parts i'm gonna as i wash the foot and then dry it i'm gonna take that towel off and i'm gonna wash
that foot right in front of myself totally totally naked right what's john looking at while
you're washing his foot hmm you'll ask yourself the question have these people done it and the
answer is the ones that are born again have been sunk in death and resurrected those are the true
believers those are the true um if you're not willing to enter into death and resurrection
you're never going to make it through the right you're never going to make it there's too much
fear involved there if you fear for your life that much you're not going to be able to do this
yeah unless we hold you down do it forcefully to you but you know although you could argue
they're doing that at the cave atrophonias and because they just drop you in there and then
you're around the snakes and you're on the hallucinogen and you know next thing you know
you're screaming there's no way out it's totally pitch black dark you could argue that that's really
not voluntary kind of but you have to be willing if you are a christian and you love jesus christ
you'll love the christing you'll understand what it is and you'll follow that what we
have today with theology the apocalypse tonight is showing us we don't have what we used to
this is not christianity is not the mystery religion at once was judieism is not the
religious mystery that it once was yeah yeah we have to reconcile the fact that our
conceptions of our own past are not the reality this is the mystery for you to look into that
mirror and for you to see i am not what i thought i was
you're awake and unafraid that's what they used to say about it this person now who's been
initiated is awake and unafraid oh god is that gorgeous give me the next one we need to we need
to um touch off here people are people are like oh my god the texts are endless let's finish up
right okay um skip this one i want to go quick this is the yep there's the biting and i just want
yep fine that's the stinging right the stinging um here's some bees and wasps for you that's great
give me the next one um it also what is that stinging associated with bineo which means to
in ire and what does it mean to in ire why did they translate this into latin because
they were um victorian prudes and to in ire literally means to go into um to enter into someone
you know what i'm talking about um to co ire to enter into it together right as a as a pair
right look who it refers to right away we get aristophanies right oh that's nice
passively it's used of the woman are we getting closer right do you understand where that sting
comes from do you understand right okay i've been stung let's get it let's get it that's
literally what it says and here's paul i just want to skip to the end here's i noticed on the third
line down angelo satana who is paul when paul is doing his drugs he's on the venom and he's got the
star what does he do what what happens he's entering into a place where he gets an angelo
and the the the title of these angelo is pantocrator pantocrator who's this one satana
who's paul called who's paul's personal angel you didn't know this you didn't know satan
was paul's personal angel when he said he got to the third heaven and he was like oh i don't know
if it was actually there or not right right i don't know whether it was just an illusion
or or whether it was a reality i don't know whether i was physically there i don't know
right people listen to paul the apostle and they they talk about him like he's the biggest
brain on the planet let me tell you something you put paul the apostle next to an epaminides
and he's gonna crush him they both quoted the same thing by the way they both quoted medea
both paul and epaminides quoted medea all cretins are liars right uh
he couldn't hold a candle paul couldn't hold a candle you remember what he said
he said i was in that state
i don't know if i was in my body
but i was in that heaven right whatever level that he went to because there's different levels
and you look at me you'd be like that's now first of all the the person of faith will say
i can see how that could be the person of not faith would be like what the hell does that mean
right what do you mean there's different levels apparently apparently when you go through the
death process and are brought back by these drugs apparently you can access and see the structure
there's a divine structure to the cosmos ruled by daimones oh my god are you kidding me
no and he's talking about that vision people used to say you mean there's drugs in the new
testament oh my god um where are there not drugs when you're using a term like christ which is a
drug term paul is going up dude that guys they noticed this dude is is is um by the way this is
the perfect question to ask next time you're with one of your one of your um honest friends
you know and maybe they start talking about praise this and praise that um ask them why is paul
immune to venom immune to snake venom is there something funny why is jesus telling people
hey you can use venom and it won't hurt you are you guys a part of a drug cult
the answer is yes give me the last we're going to go to this last i wanted you guys to see
the title almond is your mind an apple of disparities garden that's gorgeous who said that
it was calzone is gorgeous gorgeous love it oh yeah oh yeah who's that apple for by the way
right eyes are open eyes are open you want the fruit god was a total liar everybody knows yahu's
a liar right what did he say you eat that fruit you're going to die you're going to die mom satan
says no how are you not going to die no your eyes are going to be open much the contrary you're
going to see things like he does like they do the divinities do did you know they're plural
you're going to see things like the gods yeah and you'll be naked right and sure enough that's
you know sure enough you know devil's word was good why you know it's to sit in that position
to sit in that position and guard that fruit if he was ugly would have been much better he should
have picked the ugliest angel he knew alfred the ugly anglo-saxon angel that's who he should have picked
right to guard that fruit she would have looked at alfred and been like oh god right now it was the
devil and he was the best looking what do you think go what a dummy yahu is dumb he's just plain
out dumb if a full third of your own people decide that you're dumb and they follow the
good-looking dude who seems to have his act together by the way kane is not adam's child
oh my god what do we have here this is the power this is the power in turning that
that right teletai that completion that initiation bringing in the ostenae right you ever seen
somebody on opium like in an opium den you ever see those pictures right opium dens look them up
what do you see ostenae the ostenae is absolutely necessary i'm the alpha and the omega i am the
one who is the one who was and the one who will be i am the panto krator and everybody will tell
you every theologian will tell you oh this is from almighty in hebrew oh no let's see what they did
let's see how bad look at the greek look at how much this word is used do you know what a panto
kran terai do you know what those are those mmm those are the fates you you mean it yeah panto
kratera panto krate or the verb wait what was the second when you said panto kratera
do you know what that is that is the original right yahoo right is that panto krator do you
know before they called yahoo that do you know who else they called that uh they called fusus
give me the next slide give me that big beautiful one look at this people it's an orphic hymn to
nature and if you look down on the left hand side you're going to see the one two three fourth line
down panto kratera do you know who nature is she's urania you mean she's venus yes and do you do you
know what they called her they called her the same thing that the jews and christians
called their divinity they took her title which was already established and they reworked it
into a dude you mean the all-powerful refers to a woman yes it does and judaism and christianity
took that woman and made her a man think about that they took her and made her a man okay
