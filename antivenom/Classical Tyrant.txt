You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did
And I thank you
Welcome back
to Lady Babylon
This is better than Muse
and this episode
is gonna have to be prefaced
This episode, we're gonna have to
introduce this episode
It is so radioactive
It is so radioactive
as soon as the thumbnail hit
I got messages
on messages on messages
Oh my god, the response
was spectacular
It was spectacular
People really want to come
to see the tyrant in hell
and I appreciate that
I appreciate that
Lucian appreciates that
Yes, and ultimately
your brain will appreciate that too
Satanic congregation
what I've got for you tonight
is going to be delicious
Now, you know me
You know me, what I'm all about
This is a temple of the Muse, baby
and you know how it works
We use that power
of Hecate
to protect that Edelon
and who is Hecate?
I've been going on YouTube
Mostly YouTube
That's where I hang
and I'm looking at different
people talking about Hecate
and I'm thanking myself
over time, these people
they've never met
They've never met
You see, the problem
is that wall
I think it's the fourth
It has to come down
Hecate
Who is Hecate?
She's the one who dances
with the dead
She's the one who dances
with the dead
If you didn't understand Hecate
it's because you haven't
danced with the dead
Are you ready to dance
with the dead tonight?
Now, in typical
almond fashion
what I'm going to do
is I'm going to bring up
those ghosts
and I've only got one for you tonight
but listen, here's the preview
Listen
What is happening
is you're about to witness
the magic
of the muse
We're going to reach into the past
and we're going to pull
We're going to pull
that tyrant
right out
right out of hell
and we're going to look him in the face
That's what tonight is
Tonight is the mirror magic
If you don't understand what that is
that is the heart
of Bacchic worship
looking into one's self
looking in the mirror
Why?
Because you don't know who you are
and I've got a lot of messages
from people
who
Oh
Amen
I've followed you
I admire your scholarship
but you have profaned
the blessed and holy
orange
you have
What are we doing here?
What I'm going to bring you
is an ancient source
and that ancient source is a mirror
and we're going to look into that mirror
We're going to look right into the tyrant
We're going to see
who the tyrant is
This is fresh, people
What I bring to you
is from the spring
This is a classical well
Don't tell me to hurry up
Don't tell me to hurry up
I do things my way
And you're going to love this
Oh, God, Satanic congregations
You are going to love it
Let's get to it
Are you ready, Chewie?
Go ahead and hit the number one
People, who am I bringing you?
I'm bringing you Lucian
Lucian has a story
has a story about
people going to hell
and Lucian
tells us about the tyrant
who went to hell
and how he ran
his real pain in the butt
for Hermes, right?
Here's Hermes, right?
He's trying to tell the story
of what's been going on
because he's been delayed
in bringing all the souls for the day
He's the soul bringer
He's the soul bringer
Here's the anthropology
He's the psychopomp
He's the one, how does he do it?
He does it with that wand
with your symbol of medicine
That wand
is the conveyor
of souls, right?
Everybody who's been here
and who's been watching the cold
note that down in your anthropological notebooks, right?
What's going on?
And the tyrant tries to run away
Hermes has to go back and get him
and that's where we enter this story
and we're going to look
at the classical tyrant
and what is so neat about it
The magic here is you're going to find a core
In Greek
you're going to find
the trump
You're going to find the trump
Oh, God, you're going to love this
You're going to love the connection
You're going to be like, how do you do that?
It's not me, it's not me
I'm not the one pulling the levers
That's the power, that's the power
of that muse
that classical voice
You should be thanking me
and allowed to be here
because none of us are worthy of that voice
That's a pure
and gorgeous
That's right, stay back
Dragon says, stay back
First one steps over the line
You get the arrow
Oh, God
Give it to me, go ahead, Chewie
Hit me with that first source
Hermes, what are you going to tell us, Hermes?
Look, the guy didn't want to stay here
Right?
He's some kind of tyrant
He's some kind of tyrant
Right?
And what's happening?
The things that he's saying
Oh, my God, he's wanting to leave
and go back for
you know, for Eudaimonia
He's missing his Eudaimonia
He's missing his what?
He's missing that
prosperity
He's missing his prosperity
Number one, arrow
Hit it, give me the next one
Do you people want to see
Oh, do you people want to see
what this guy's name is?
Right?
His name is Great Misery
Megapenthes
And he is
Turanis
And what is that? The word tyrant
is a Greek word
The word tyrant
Everybody after Mother Greek came along
borrowed it
and said, huh, what a great invention
The festivals
in Athens
that are meant to purge society
Those are
festivals in which I go
and watch somebody get
possessed
Right? Tell the people who are acting today
Break down that fourth wall
You got to be possessed or it doesn't work
People who are
possessed bring you
the tyrant
People who are possessed
And why would you want to go watch that?
Besides all the good food and everything
Why would you want to go watch that?
Because it'll purge you
It'll cleanse you
and our democracy will be stronger
Do you understand?
This is for the deems
Yeah
Neighborhoods
Give me the next one
Oh God, what is this? What's happening?
So here we've got the spirit
of the tyrant
And we're taking his spirit to hell
And he's trying to get away
He's trying to get away
Right? And they're collecting
All the souls are being collected
and put onto the boat where
Keron is
And what kind of souls?
We got babies
And we got old people
Isn't that something? We got babies
And they're all like fresh grapes
And then we got old people
This is what
The Moirai are saying
This is what they're saying
Of the people
The souls that they're collecting
Look, you got young ones, you got old ones
You got ones that are killed by tyrant
You got a couple of those
You got ones that are killed by
Leistai
By pirates
It's a wonderful little look
At the anthropology
What's going on?
Yeah, what are your death rates about?
Well, let's see
Give me the next one
So here we are, we've got our tyrant with us
We've got our tyrant with us
And Clotho says, look people
Bring me the people who've been judged
By the courts, I want them
I want the people
Who have been beaten
And the ones that have been tortured
Right? And I want the ones that the
Pirates
That the Leistai, those guys
They're involved
Where are they Hermes, right?
So we're collecting souls
We're collecting souls
Wait, the tyrant is coming
Just wait, you'll see, give me the next one
And what happens?
What happens?
A little guy named Puppy Man
Right? Cuniscos
Right? Puppy Guy comes up
Puppy Guy is a cool guy
Right? And why is that?
Listen to him, listen to him speak
Remember, this is a soul
Speaking to the powers
Of the cosmos
And what does this
Soul say?
Says, look, I've been standing
Next to you, you know
You best of goddesses
Clotho, right? That's your name
I've been standing here next to you
You have given me a life
That's, you know, I don't deserve
What you've given me, the length of time
That you've spread out for me
Give me the next one
And Clotho is like
Look, look, he's like
Why'd you do that? You didn't have to do that
And she says, don't you love it
Isn't that tender and beautiful
And what does she say to him?
Look, I've made things this way
So that you could be an overseer
And a doctor to these
Humans who do such
Bad things
So
Get on the boat and
Good fortune to you, brother
Right? That's what
That's how the soul is
Interacting. Now wait
We're gonna look in the mirror
Where's that timer? Give me the next one
We gotta search down that timer
I'm gonna jump to it, right?
Pretty quick tonight
Because I want you to see
What you are doing
Because
That's the power of the muse
Okay? The power to
Look into that mirror
What does that little puppy guy
Say? You know, he's a good guy
I like him. He ends up in a good place
Right? But
He says
Well, you see, there's no verb in that sentence
Yeah, there is. It's invisible
Isn't Greek amazing? Anyway
It says, look, this guy mega-penthies
That is the dude who is
Super miserable
He's a tyrant. Here he comes
He's the guy who's been causing so much trouble
Hermes had to go running after him
Give me the next one, please, Chewie
Hermes had to go running after him
What is it that he
Keeps trying to get back
That he was taken away at death
He's trying to get his
Prosperity, his good fortune
His opulence
Okay? His
Opulence
The tyrant
Is chasing
The opulence
Give me the next one, tyrants chasing
The opulence
Let's see, let's keep going
What does the
Moira say to him?
She says
For what sake
For what sake did you come here?
And he says
Mega-penthies says
Um
I went to the
Hang on
Oh, yeah
For what sake
Would you have me
Send you back
And he says, for the sake of
Completing
My mansion, baby
My house is only
Well, it's not finished
Right?
It's only half-finished
Right?
Half-completion
And I haven't
Built it, right?
He's got a mansion
Down somewhere, I don't know
Maybe it's in Florida, it's not done
It's not finished
That's why he's asking to go back
And she's like
Why the hell do you want to go back?
Give me the next one
And what does the tyrant say
Day-race
Day-race
One word, watch this power
Of the Greek, give me the next slide
One word
Here it is
This is actually from Laodos
Trash
Trumpery
I told you, there was Trump
Buried in this, I didn't put in there
Do you understand?
Here's our trumpery
What are you doing?
You're running after
That which is showy
But is useless
What is the tyrant?
Love
More than anything, you mean
The Greeks are not managing tyrants
Based upon their political party
And their affiliation
And whether they're an ism or that
Or this left or right
Or liberal or conservative
No, they're not
The number one test
For a tyrant
Is greed
Is greed
You want that luxury, don't you?
You want that luxury
You see, the Greeks were scientific
Very scientific people
They invented the scientific method
Thank goodness they did
Or you and I would be traipsing around in bogs
Yes
How do you tell a tyrant?
Number one
Is that tyrant
A servant of greed
Is that tyrant's a servant of greed?
Are you looking into the mirror
At the tyrant?
Are you a servant of greed?
Is that your thing?
Oh god
Now, why is that so?
Why is that particularly so bad?
Because you see, I hate to say this
But I'm gonna go ahead and interject
Here, something. I'm sitting with the watchers
The other day watching
We were talking about the court
Bring up that court
We were talking about the court
That finally gave
This one
That finally gave
Complete and
Total power
To a mortal
We're talking about that court
And I said, do you see
Thomas sitting there with his big smile
On? Do you know why?
I said this to a watcher
I said this to a watcher
I said, do you know why he's sitting there with a big smile?
Because he
Is going on vacation
He's going on vacation
He's gonna take the billionaire's vacation
He's gonna do it
Mmm
The watchers don't find that stuff funny
They don't find it funny because
That's how you lose justice
Once you put a mortal
Above
Everybody
You're safe as long as
That mortal is still underneath justice
Right?
This is a unified people
We are all
Equal under the law
We are all equal
And when you're most corrupt
Court
In supreme court history
Nobody has gotten
The millions upon millions
That these people have
What happens
Justice leaves
We're not concerned about
Whether or not anybody's going
To get justice
What we're concerned about now
Is finding out what is a tyrant
What is a tyrant
Greed
Greed, always the mark of the tyrant
Always the mark of the tyrant
And when I say greed
I'm talking about
Ancient
Desire
For that which is going to elevate
You
I'm talking about, look dude
If I give you
This speech
You accept
And repent of your sins
You're gonna get eternal life
That kind of exchange
Is a greed
Based exchange
You wouldn't
Be going to heaven
Unless there was something that you were gonna do
Right? You're gonna get
I'm gonna give over
My brain to this virus
And I'm gonna perpetuate this virus
And I'm gonna sit and be
Self delusional with this virus
Yeah, greed
You thought you knew ancient
Ethics didn't you? Shame on you
I have a sting for your
Buttices
Shame on you
You had no idea
What the ancient ethic was
You had no idea what
Mother Greed gave us
Greed
Do you see a commandment about
Thou shalt not be greedy?
Put it at the top
Put it at the top
This
Is the ancient
Ethic
Give me the next one
Oh god
What does she say to him?
Clota says look
Your brain is in the wrong place baby
And what is
Mr. Misery who is the tyrant
What does he say? Oh
I don't need much time Moira
I don't need I'm just asking
For a little bit you know
For a little bit of time
Maybe one day to stay there
And what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna show my wife
Where all the money is
Interesting
Right
Why doesn't she know already
I'm gonna show my wife
Where all the money is
I've got a big
Treasury
I've got a big stash that I've hidden
That's why he wants to go back
What is it
That's on his mind
The gold
Give me the next one
The gold is on his mind
Is the gold on the mind
Of the tyrant
Let's see
Let's see
Look what happens
What Clotho says to him here
Right
You're done
You're done
With those
Things that you had
He tells her at the top line
He tells her you know
All of that stuff was mine
And she says guess what
Your time of procuring
Is over
Your time of
Procuring is over
The tyrant procures
The tyrant
Gets
The tyrant gets gold
And the tyrant gets salvation
The tyrant gets the obliteration
The obliteration
Of anybody who's not
Of the tyrant
Do you see the power it has
Over you
What am I doing
This is Ludovico
Your eyes are open
I'm giving you the serum
I'm showing you what your tyranny is
The Trumpery
Oh
Oh the horror
The Trumpery
It's amazing
You thought it was what was important
But it's not
Where are we going to put
The Trumpery
We're going to put it in flagathon
The burning river
Of the underworld
Now you say that sounds
Kind of Christian
Right it's because the Christians bode
Everything
From the very same mystery
Some of them are practicing it
Openly too
We'll call them heretics
Right
Trumpery
Where is the
Trumpery
Are you looking at it
Okay give me the next one
Watch this people
What does this tyrant says
He says listen up clotho
Right
I don't want
I don't want to
Be heard by these people
Around us
Come here with me let me tell you something
Come a little distance away
Okay so she says look
He whispers in her ear
Hey
If you let me go
I will give you
1000 talents
Of stamped
Gold
1000 talents
Of stamped gold
That means it's got a face on it
Right
It's currency
It's guaranteed
He's got
1000 talents
That's a lot
He's a billionaire baby
This is
Pick out any of your billionaire
This is him
Are we there
Are we looking in the mirror
Where is Trump looking in the mirror yet
Is the Trumpery going on
Do you have that one
No you don't let's see
Let's go to this one
She says you're a moron
You're laughably an idiot
You still
It's a question
She says you still have your mind
On the gold
He's dead
He's dead
But you can't take that out of him
What kind of misery
Is it being a tyrant
You can't take that out of them
That misery
Is Ionic
You've heard about Ionic life
I'm bringing you Ionic misery
Ionic misery
Let's see what happens
Let's see what happens to the
Tyrant
I'm so excited
I've got whips for the tyrant
You love your money so much
Don't you
You have a bunch of people who love your money
And your prosperity
Don't you
You want your luxury
You want your luxury
Nice job
Constantine
Give me that one
Go for it
This is
This is not going to happen
Somebody else
Is going to build your wall
I just thought that was
I thought that was cute
Because one of the things he wants to do
Is he wants to go back and have the power
To build
The wall
Yeah
He's not going to get his wall
He's nuts man
Are you kidding
He's dead
Give me the next one
I hope he's
Paying attention
You know what I mean
Oh god
Now
Yeah
When things get down to
This is a negotiation
Clotho is insisting
Let me just step back and explain
Clotho is
insisting that he get on the boat
For death
Right
That he needs to be transported
Across to the underworld
And he's insisting
And he just keeps
Trying to bribe her
Trying to do anything
To get out of it
Now what does he do
He's negotiating
He's negotiating
Because the tyrant
The negotiation
Even
When it's corrupt
Even when it's corrupt
The tyrant
Cannot
See in the mirror
That's why the bonk
Ecstasy
Is meant to force you to look into the mirror
What does he say here
What's the negotiation
I will give you
My wife
In my place
Will you take that
And of course she's like no
We don't do that
Because the books of accounting
For hell
Are so extensive
Everybody has to be accounted for
Down to the person
The unique individual
That is you
Every one of them
Again, this is the classical
Mind
At work
Nature is so
Perfect
She is so beautiful
Everything goes, the curves go right together
All the pieces
They just paw, they make this
Oneness, oh god
I turned down the mojo
Right
So our ultimate
Reckoning
That logos
Is
Always
Correct
You can't substitute
Somebody's actions for your actions
Your time has come
And the tyrant just doesn't
Want to face
That end
Give me the next one
The tyrant doesn't want to face that end
Boom
Here he is, what does he say
Yeah
Again, we're back to negotiating
Right
He says
At least do this for me
Tell me, I want to know
What is coming
What is happening
What's going to happen to my estate
And everything like that
You
Yeah, fantastic
All right, here we go
Now for those of you who are like
Hey, you shut up
I take the road
I don't take the information highway
I take the little tiny
Frontage road
That's got eight
NBPS baby
Hey, somebody's got to be classical
Here's mega penthees
What does mega penthees says
The tyrant says look
Please, just tell me
What's going to happen to my
In my estate
Everything I've worked for
All of that
Glory that I worked for
Give me the next one
Clotho says
Okay, here's what's going to happen
Your daughter
Is going to be handed over
To those prostitutes of power
Your daughter
Is going to be handed over
To those prostitutes
Of power
All of your images
Mr. Tyrant
All of your images and statues
They're going to throw those down
And they're going to laugh
Not at you
But at themselves
For having ever listened
To any of your junk
Yeah
Yeah
They're going to make
Looking in the mirror
Great again
That's what they're going to do
Why is she saying that?
Because that's how civilizations are
Right, the people at the time
You have to understand people at the time
Are fighting against the rise
Of tyrants
Whether it's a handful of them
Or whether it's one, it doesn't matter
And they have developed
Systems for dealing
With tyrants in the number one
Control
The number one control
Is the oracle
Is the oracle, did you know?
There's a group of oracles
Throughout the Mediterranean
There's a group of oracles
They work together
Uh-huh
They're the real power and antiquity
And I'm not the only one to say that
Right, they're the real power
The Bronze Age power and antiquity
And if you go to one of those oracles
As an official delegation
Of your town
And you present the question
What do we do with our orange nightmare?
She'll tell you
Exactly what to do
And you have the legal right
To go back
To your town
And to carry out her sentence
Amazing
Why would you give them
So much power
Because they hate
Tyrants
Something to do with that age, man
Something to do with that age
And those drugs they were on
The tyrants have to go
Can you see the unattractive nature
Of a tyrant?
Where is he? Where is he again?
Where is our guy? Get him looking in the mirror
Get him looking in the mirror
Come here!
There he is
Look at this image, people
For one second, look at the image
Who is attracted?
Who?
Who is attracted to this image?
You must be seeing something
That the rest of us aren't
There's something that is drawing you
Is it
The greed?
Is it the greed?
Is it
The superiority?
Is it the confidence?
Is it that power?
Are you drawn to that?
Can you feel it?
Okay, let's see what else
Let's see what else is going to happen to our tyrant
And what makes a tyrant a tyrant
Clothes, though, says, yeah, that's going to happen
We did that one
Check this out
I just want you to see
This is who
It's considered the prostitution
Of his daughter
To another person in power
To make up
A dynasty
If you will
We don't have dynasties
In Rome
Now that we kicked the kings out
We don't have dynasties
Oh, don't get me wrong, we have powerful families
We have plenty of that
But those consuls, they don't form dynasties
Our leaders don't form dynasties
Yeah
It's only when you get empire
When the republic is dead
That you get dynasties
Tyranny
And family rule
Go hand in hand
Hand in hand
Okay
Alright
Give me the next one
What else about these tyrants?
Look what tyrant ancient trump says
He says, epe moite, tell me
Right?
Is nobody up there upset?
She says
What are you saying?
Do you think you actually
Had friends?
Don't you know that all of those
People who were bowing to you
And saying, oh god
The stuff you're doing is so great
James Page
Don't you know that?
They were what?
They were doing that out of fear
And hope
To get what you would leave behind
You got no friends
You got friends who are friends
Of power
Yeah
Yeah
They're just waiting for the opportunity
She tags on there
And she says
Don't you understand this?
Don't you know?
Imagine
Donald J Trump
Imagine him
With a friend
Do you think that man has friends?
Do you think that man has friends?
I know a lot of the people
Who want to get pardoned are his friends
Yeah
Are those real friends?
Do you see what the greek mind
Is grabbing onto and preserving
And holding up is the real beauty
The sad thing is
Don
Don never sees it coming
His life
Is an eternal loop
It's an eternal loop of not
Knowing himself
His misery
Is brought by his own greed
Superbus
They called the roman tyrant
They called him superbus
He was arrogant
And he was haughty
When was the last time you voted
In somebody who was humble
Not this guy
I don't know about you people
But this guy has
Every mark of the tyrant
Almost like this document
Was written for him
And it's a perfect reflection
Of you
It's a perfect reflection
Of you
Here's my wifey
What is she going to do
What is she going to do
Let's find out
Yes
She's going to say off with you
To the underworld while her lover
Is with her making love to her
While her lover
Did we find a photograph
Of that? I think we found
Some kind of AI photograph
There it is
What's your wife doing
Behind your back
What's your wife doing
I guarantee one thing
I guarantee one thing
It's not anything with you
What is the
Trade of the tyrant
That his wife can't stand him
Well
I don't know
I don't know her personally
I don't know if she looked in the mirror
With that sour face
It's got to be reflecting
Some kind of displeasure
Discomfort
Definitely
Definitely you see how
The greek world
Determines and judges its surroundings
Dude
That person never smiles
You can't support that
They got
None of that
No power in the world
That stays with you
The reason that you're not afraid
To go to the underworld
The reason you're not afraid to die
Yeah
Yeah, they've been there
They've been there
These two? No
That's not how the tyranny works
The tyranny is all consuming
The tyranny is all consuming
There is no way to pry it
Out of the hands
That person
Without them
Suffering the same fate
Is pentheus the tyrant
Yeah
Same fate awaits
Give me the next one
Oh, there's a couple more here
Oh, doctor fever
Did we put politics to war in religion, baby?
Right, yeah, I can't have one without the other
Give me the next one
So, here we are
Another dude comes up in the process
And who is this dude?
This dude makes shoes
That's all sandals
He's a sandal-making guy
And, you know what he says?
He walks up and he says,
Look, listen to me
Oh, you
Most honored of goddesses
He's talking
He's getting on the boat
And he says
I used to live next to a tyrant
And very close, I got to observe everything
That went on with him
And it seems to me
That he was equal
To a god
Even down to
His purple outfit
That guy was so lucky
That's how he seemed to me
Give me the next one, Chewie
But
Almost like the dude was a
Hooperanthropos
Does everybody see that
That middle word?
Hooperanthropos
It's got two accents
Because that little tis after it loses its accent
To it, right? Okay, cool
What is a Hooperanthropos?
You know, anthropos
Is a man
Or person, or being
And Hooper is just, you know, if you
Latinize that, it becomes super
Who is this?
This is literally
Superman
Now
Okay, all right
This is
The image
In the mind of the shoemaker
Of what
The tyrant is
Of what the tyrant is
Do you see him?
He's the Superman
This is the image
That the tyrant
Himself
Is chasing
This is that static in the air
Right?
We all want Henry Cavill
We do
We all want Henry Cavill
You know what I mean? I'll admit it
I don't have a problem with that
I got no problem with Chewie
Right?
With this complete fascination
With the Superman
Right?
He's got everything
He's got everything
Everything that he's got
That is what the tyrant
Is looking for
But the shoemaker knows
And says, that's not really how things are
Right?
When you don't value
Those things
Their loss is meaningless
To you
Their loss is meaningless
You see where the ethic is going
Give me the next one
Watch this
Okay
Look at the second line
And the third word in
It's the truffe
It's the truffe that he really wants
That spectacular
thing
That when you look at it
It's just, oh god
I gotta have that
But you realize it's meaningless
Over time
It's meaningless, it's empty
It's a bobble
You could have had Henry Cavill
Instead, you got a contract
With X, Y, and Z
You'll make some money on it
But will it make you happy?
No, it won't
There's an emptiness there
There's an emptiness there
Even down to his robe
His robe that is
I like how he says this
It's bloodstained
It's bloodstained
With that mollusk from
The Laconian Sea
They're talking about collection
Of the purple there, right?
Why?
Because in antiquity
You can take it down, in antiquity
The marker, oh and there's
Edimonia in that one too
That he's looking for
The marker
Of monetary power
Is not how big your estate is
Or how big your house is
Your villa
Although they do that too
The marker of it is whether you have
Access to purple
There's a reason
It's associated with royal power
Right?
What you see
Donald J
What you see that draw
Of the purple
That draw is the draw
Of tyranny
And it really doesn't matter
Right?
It really doesn't matter that you walk around in purple
Okay, let's see, there's a couple more
What's he gonna do?
What's the tyrant do to people, by the way?
We've got a whole section
Oh, God, by Heracles he says
This is the shoemaker
He says, look, it's so dark down here
Right? It's so dark down here
Mmm, God
I can't even tell
When you're playing, and I can't even tell
Whether somebody's attractive
Or not, look, it's Simiqi
Is she better looking than Frini?
He says, I don't know
Everything's sort of equal
And it's kind of homohoho
It's kind of the same color
Everything is equal
It's the same color
Nobody's beautiful
And nobody's more beautiful
Than anybody else, that's what he says
And look, even me
In my little ratty tat tat
Clothing, it's all torn up
And little ugly stuff
He says, it doesn't matter
It's equal to those
Purpleed robes
Of the kings
It's equal to
The purple robe
That the royalty are wearing
My little
Do you see what happens, people?
There is an ultimate equalizer
Built into justice
And anyone
Who is
Suffering
From that draw
Any
Tyrants, whether they're tyrants
Who are running for office
And trying to overthrow
The current government disband
The FBI, whether it's that type
Or whether it's other people running
In the system
Or it's people outside
It doesn't matter, you don't have to be involved
You don't have to have a stamp
If that tyrannical draw
Is in you
You got the greed
Do you know what you live in?
You live in the kingdom of the devil
And his job is to punish you
Look into the mirror
And look at your God
With his orange, ridiculous skin
I'm glad they don't care about that
In the underworld, because that stuff bothers me
I think it's a sign of his desire
Really, I think it's a sign of his draw
To be that Superman
Right?
And isn't it funny that nature has a
The muse who draws out
The quantum reality
The muse who
Weaves those strands together
The quantum reality
She is always bringing irony
She's always giving you
Look at everything that happens in human affairs
And you can say, wow
What kind of lesson is that?
The least
Henry Cavill
On the planet
Is the one that you
Find attractive
You've got to ask yourself
Is it the tyranny?
Is that what it is?
Is it the tyranny? Look into the mirror
You don't know who you are
You don't know what kind of life you're living
Do you see
The only way
That I'm going to bring this to you
Is if it's a part
Of that classical song
And it very much is
We have giant festivals
To show you what a tyrant is
So we don't make this mistake
Of electing one
Of electing one
Interesting
Interesting
Now you thought
The definition of a tyrant would be some kind of
You know, somebody gets donations
And they have a power back
And they have their politics
No, no
Look at the greed
Look what happens
Give me the next one
Yeah, yeah
Tell me
This is the shoemaker again
And shoemaker and puppy guy
His name means puppy
They hit it off
They're two nice people
And they end up holding hands
When they get to the underworld
And they're like, this is the first thing
The shoemaker says, he says, wait a minute
Look, is it just me or doesn't
This look like
What they taught us
In the Ellis city and mysteries
Doesn't this look exactly
Like what we saw?
Yeah
Do you see? He's not afraid
The person who's been
Through the mystery
Knows and is not afraid
It's the reason they're born
Again, not because they're
Reaching for something
Eternal life, give me eternal life
Jesus Christ, give me eternal life
No
It's because they've seen it
Because they have been
Through the nourishing
Of the great mother
They know
Yeah
Is that why they're not greedy?
Hmm
Wouldn't that be funny? Wouldn't that be funny
If people would go through this right
Open up their eyes
Have an experience they write about
And say, my God, man
I wasn't even born
Before this happened
I know what life is now
And all of a sudden
They don't care about
Your money
Now, if your reputation
Is having gotten where you are
Because of your money
And your ability to make it
Do you know that is this
Un-American
That is as un-American as
Anything
We
Hate
Tyrants
Our ancestors fought
Tyrants
Yeah
Look
For which one
Is it sleepy?
Or is it
Mr. Greed
Golden
Golden
Toilet Greed
Golden toilet
You know what it costs to sit on a golden toilet
It costs a lot of people
Food
I know I'm a poor guy
And I work hard
So that I can eat
And it's getting harder and harder
Just to eat
And do you know what's happening
With
Mr. Mega Misery
He is crapping
On your food
That
Is a tyrant
That
Is a tyrant
That's a tyrant
Give me the next one
We're almost done
And grateful that you give me the time
That you
Have
So these two guys
They're making good friends
The shoemaker and what's his name
And they come up to the judge
This is Radamanthus
Radamanthus
And what does he say?
So who are you?
And he introduces himself
I'm Kniskos
I'm a little puppy guy
What am I?
I'm a philosopher
I'm a philosopher
He's a philosopher
Fantastic
You'll be glad you stayed
Because I'm about to show you what happens in hell
You ready? This is so cool
I don't know the physics of this
Somebody should make up
The physics of this
And put it into like a drama
Some kind of sci-fi
Okay, this is awesome
Let's go back to the one that we were just on
He says who are you?
And he says I'm dog man
And I'm a philosopher
Up here I use my nomad
You know what I mean? Go down
Give me the next one
He says but
Okay, Knisuke
Right? You gotta tell me something
Right? I'm gonna look
I'm gonna look
At you
For any
Stigmata
Wait what?
He's going to strip him
And he's going to look
For his tattoos
The ones that are on the souls
Of every mortal
Wait, every mortal
Got tattoos on their soul
Yes, again
Don't understand the physics
Let's see how those tattoos get there
Are you ready? Why do you think tattoos are so important?
Those magic words
Why do you think they're so important?
It's a reflection of
Reality
Beyond the event horizon
I love this stuff
Let's figure it out
Give me the next one
So that I can see your tattoos
And he says
Wait a minute
He says
Knisuke
Wait a minute, I've got tattoos
Where have I got tattoos?
How do I get those tattoos?
He's like, huh?
The judge of the dead
One of the judges
The judge of the dead says
Whenever somebody does
Something, I'm translating
It's really bad
In their lifetime
There's an invisible
Tattoo
That is placed
Upon the soul
The soul bears a tattoo
But it's when you do terrible, shameful
Terrible, shameful things
Bad things, brah
Don't be doing bad things
What happens to this poor guy?
He lets him go
He says
Look, I'm going to tell you something
I once had a lot of tattoos
The underworld judge
Looks at his soul
And he says
You've got a few here
They've been healed over
You've got some kind of drug
And he tells him
Before I was a philosopher
I did some bad things
And I got some soul tattoos
But, you know, when I started
Practicing philosophy
I realized I could rub those out
Clean those out a little bit with the philosophy
He made himself
A better person
With philosophy
And I'm not talking modern day philosophy
Those guys are power hungry
Idiots, right?
Pettiness, petty power
Not even real power, he's petty
Um, yeah
Yeah, let me not
Yeah
And so anyway, he says
Look, you know, I cleaned things up
I cleaned up my act with philosophy
This is the love of wisdom
This is what causes you to question things
Right?
When somebody tells you this is the way the universe is
And you think a little voice in your head says
Shut up, darling
You don't know what you're talking about
Right? It's good to engage that voice
Right?
Because that voice will lead you to investigate
To learn
That's the love of wisdom, baby
We're Athenians
We're the ones who invented democracy for goodness sakes
Now as you think we're going to be chasing that
You can use that love of wisdom
To get rid of those
Soul tattoos
Yeah
So the shoemaker and
Mr. Poppy guy
They both go off happy
Holding hands, they knew what was coming
They've been through the rites
They didn't have marks
But that's not the same thing
What's going to happen to the tyrant
What's going to happen to the tyrant?
Let's see
Let's see
Okay
First of all
The judge is going to bring something up
You realize
That this dude
Has killed
Without justice
Right?
There's no judgment involved
Tyrants
Commit extra
Judicial killing
And they get away with it
Right?
When somebody gets shot
On the sixth
That blood
Is a killing
That blood is a killing
Right?
There has to be some sort of answer
There has to be some sort of fury
That writes that wrong
Or that blood
Spreads and the pollution
Spreads
In order to avoid justice
The tyrant commits
Murder
Whenever a tyrant tells you
We want some kind of
Trial for this person
And this person's trial is not going to be
In a court, it's going to be under different
Circumstances
That's extrajudicial
Extrajudicial
Military
Tribunes
Military
Tribunes
Those are old
And guess what? That's not the law of the land
That's not the law of the land
Yeah
Thank goodness
There are people out there
Who are willing to stand against the tyrant
Who is the sexiest
Woman on the planet right now?
Who is the sexiest woman? Bring her up
Bring up Liz
Bring her up
Liz Cheney
I just want to tell you
Right now you are in the position
You are in the position
Of the savior
Of the republic
Yes
There will be a time coming
Compared to people like
Cicero
You know
You stand against the tyrants
I put Liz in a
Yeah, in a better here
Just so we can spend some time together
Liz Cheney
Right? How brave
You know, I don't care
What her politics are at all
I saw this woman
Stand up in a way
That
Men didn't
I saw a
States woman born
I was like no wonder dude
No wonder they had queen hot chips
Because this is sexy
This power is sexy
Good for you Liz Cheney
Love it
Was that a political statement?
Absolutely not
I don't care what her politics are
As long as she is justly sexy
Oh god
Right? Love it
Let's get the next one
We got a couple more here people
Yeah
What does the tyrant do
When he faces the charges
Of the extrajudicial
Killing and all the list of things
That tyrants do
He says people are lying about me
The tyrant projects the lie
The tyrant
Is the master
Creator of falsehood
Right?
Tyranny
Is always
Illegitimate
In order to make itself
Appear legitimate
It must create a lie
You and I
Have watched
That whole lie
Spun out
And lady justice said nope
Your lie is just a lie
It's not legitimate at all
What did we do with our smile
On her face from the supreme court
We gave him immunity
To justice
Immunity to what? To justice
That's what a king is
The king's word is justice
You have given yourselves
A king, your greed
Has stained your souls
With the stench of ruin
And you have given yourself
A king
You lose your democracy
Give me the next one
So, look, he says
This is old
Radamanthus, who's now judging
Right? And really what's it come down to?
It doesn't come down to that
It doesn't come down to what he's wearing
Because in order to look at his soul
He's gonna rip off his purple garments
And he rips them off
And he says, holy
What?
He is covered
He can't even count the number
Of soul tattoos that Trump has
He cannot count them
He says, look, this guy
His soul is black all over the place
It's got big old bruises
Black and blue
Oh, god
This guy's got so many stigmata
I don't know where to start
They even overlap with each other
How can I read this? It overlaps
Because that's what he does
He reads who you are as a person
Through your stigmata
Now you're getting real antiquity
So he says, look, I don't know what to do with this guy
Um, should we just throw him
Into the puriflegethonta?
Or should we feed him
To Gerberoi?
Should we feed him to Cerberus?
Or should we throw him
Into the river of fire?
Right, there he is, he's waiting
Right, you wondered what Cerberus is
I know at least there's one of you out there
Who's total crazy
For Cerberus
Right, now's your chance, right
Who gets, who's gonna, why would you do that anyway?
Why wouldn't you?
Cerberus loves that stuff
He's gonna gulp it down
He's gonna gulp it down
But somebody else comes up
Better punishment, give me the next
Um, see, they're very democratic in hell, right?
Um
Kunisco says
Look, I know it's the custom
Right
For everybody
Who's dead to drink from the river
Lethe, right, it's the custom
Okay
To drink from the river of forgiveness
He says, I know this case
And
Radhamanthus says, you know it buddy
Right, you keep going
You know it
And Kunisco says
Okay, so
Why don't you make this one guy
Not
Drink from the
From the waters of forgiveness
Why don't you make him not drink it
And Radhamanthus says, what?
What?
What are you saying? Give me the next one
This will be our last
He says, what are you saying?
And Kunisco says
Look, look, look, this is ultimately
The most terrible
Punishment, this is the greatest justice
You can give to somebody like this
As you can cause them
To be constantly
Thinking about
The opulence and power
They lost
Yeah, you see where
The justice comes in
The justice comes in
When nature strips that
Tyrant of his greed
When
Justice brings
Him low
For those of you who came
Tonight looking
For Donald Trump going
To hell
I hope
You have seen into the mirror
I hope
You have seen the draw and the magic
Now of
That attraction
With the Trump cult
That
Power
The recreation of that
Tyrant
I hope you understand that a little bit better
From the ancient perspective
Of the people
Who figured out
Democracy
I thank you for coming tonight
And as usual
We're not about politics
We're about dancing
With the dead
Thank you for coming tonight
Hail Satan
We'll do this all the way
To the roads we paved
A ride up a horse from the sunshine
Blue-toned big-time wolfman
Killed side root cutter growin'
Dawn bringers shinin' in the mornin'
They puff a little bit of the chronic
Poisonous dragon venom
Darkness through dreams
Frank it's time to house up on the hill
I make it rain
I spit the hot fire
Heels above its verses
Make sure they got funny ears on the gold horns
Make a purple of the Sabbath
I'm Teddy Face Mr. Black Magic
Singing hallelujah
Deepest creepers, hot purple movya
Root cutter, evergreen tree grower
The antichrist you dream of
Thundered from unhigh
Venus in the sky
Heavy on the drums
Ada weight funk
Bar kick mania
Magdia dance with me
Where the purple flowers grow
Those with eyes to see
A kiss of Athena
Dream of Saturn
You're in this Venus dress
Roots grow from the stars overhead
Orca hymns to the moon
Orca ritual
With a kiss and a whip
Lady Babylon is with you
