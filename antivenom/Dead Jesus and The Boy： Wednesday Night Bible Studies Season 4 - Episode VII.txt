Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, and the indos crazy and the scots
Then what's to bash out the brain?
Oh that English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you gotcha sellin' and you gotcha
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
It's so nice to have you here tonight
We'll be taking a tour to the end of March
Yes, we only fulfilled half of our obligation
Half of our obligation, I'm so excited
We only fulfilled half of it by seeing them die
Right, we're there with the soldiers and everything
It's a son of God
We've only fulfilled half
Tonight we go to the second half of our commission here
And we investigate the kid that was, I'm sorry I almost said naked
But he's just a kid
The kid that was sitting next to dead Jesus
When Mary Magdalene and Salome showed up
Tonight we're gonna summon Celsus
And that's the touch point
That's gonna give us what we really need to blow up
Again, welcome back
Tonight I want to begin with some subliminal messaging
And a little bit of bringing the future and the past altogether in the present
Gonna throw some images at you
And I want us to be critical again as investigators
As those who appeal to reason, right
People have been telling me, sources, fantastic
We love it, this is ours
This is the museum that belongs to us
I'm gonna put you in the mood tonight and set you on your way
Chewie hit it
This fight has come to us
And you know what I say, bring it on
No homos will ever be allowed on this church
As long as I'm the pastor here
To let you know that verse one is the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
So help you God when you understand faith
The devil's hoping you don't know who you are
In a few years they'll die out
Do you know why they can't reproduce?
Cancer, cancer, cancer
All the pain is gone
We've prepared, birds prepare, eagles don't prepare
We've said, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah
Jesus would say to our politicians today
Who are telling us what light bulbs we can and can't use
But they won't say don't murder your children
Someone who is so deeply into paganism is to do this
It was restricted from the privileges and rights
Of citizenship within the nation
Because they had defiled the image of God
This is how you breathe in hell, it was like
Those quotes were by Celsus
And where we've gone tonight
You know, we usually get in the ship
And we go and we resurrect this dead
And we talk to the dead
Tonight what we're going to do is drag back with us
Everything
We are going now to the present
In the second century
Anno Domini
Also known as the year of our Lord
Yes, yes, we're going back
We're going back
Some of them like to call him Yahweh
Right?
But our texts say he's the Kurios
Yeah, okay, let's go
I want to go
Celsus, can you give us a little bit
And please, use that soft C on the front
Celsus, right?
It's not Celsus, you know who pronounces it that way?
People who don't have classical philology, that's who
Okay, don't, it's not
Skethian, for goodness sake
What kind of Skions do you know?
Right, it's Cithian
I know those are minor points
But in this temple to the Muse
In this place, can we please have it cleaned
Of any charlatanism?
Right, you come in here
You get on that mat and you perform
That's what's important
Let's go to Celsus, I'm going to read to you
Just a few passages of Celsus
And bombard you with some imagery
And this is from a very good translation
By R. Joseph Hoffman
This is the standard one
They make you get this one when you're
You know, in line for
Pretending that you have the ability to
Dissertate and make you get this one
Read this, yeah, love it
The Cult of Christ
Tell us Celsus about the Cult of Christ
You see, we're in the same time
And space with Celsus
That's why it's easy to bring him here
I can drag the whole universe
Backward, yeah
We're dealing with these people
Again, we're fighting for civilization
Let's see what happens
The Cult of Christ
Is a secret society
What's the year? Does he smell the year?
Oh, yeah, it's like, I don't know, 175
Yeah, 180, somewhere in that range
They even debate about that, right?
Let's just see what the man says
The Cult of Christ is a secret society
Whose members tattle together in corners
For fear of being brought to trial
And punishment
Okay, well at least I know where I am
At least I know where I am
Persistence is the persistence of a group
Threatened by a common danger
And danger is a more powerful incentive
To fraternal feeling than is any oath
Hmm, interesting
Tell me more
As to their doctrine
It was originally barbarian
And while even barbarians
Are capable of discovering truth
It happens to be the case
That Greeks are best equipped
To judge the merit of what passes for truth
These days
He keeps bringing this up
Their alignment with reason
Their alignment with reason
Who are these Christians?
Just tell me, Celces, what are these Christians doing
In their meetings? Could you please tell me?
What are they doing in their meetings?
To get some sort of power
From pronouncing the names of demons
What? They're in meetings
Pronouncing the names of demons
Okay, people back me up, right?
We're all going in to this crime scene
Back me up, here we are
Okay, what are they doing?
They're using the names for the demons
Or saying certain incantations
Hmm, epodes
Epodes, oh, I love it
I love it, now I know where I am
Where's the table with the drink?
Is it a drink or something?
I don't care, where are you...
You can put it anywhere you want
Just let's get in
Let's get on board
Let's get this throne set up
Yeah, this is gorgeous
The Christians claim to get some sort of power
Yeah, they're always incorporating
In these incantations, these epodes
Remember, epodes are the songs
That are used in conjunction with the drugs
That you and I are seeing in the things
Like the Mithras Liturgy
Fantastic!
Do you have them, Christians?
Do you have them?
Here we go
They even use the name Jesus
And a short story about him in the formula
It's no different than the Mithraic Liturgy, right?
It's the same thing, you can see them all
Look, I brought you back to an early Christian orgy
Congratulations!
It's somebody, somebody
And all I had to do was just ask this dead person
Just ask this dead person
This is like, none of this
Nobody can say, Poo Poo!
Neniskos is a dirty old man, Poo Poo!
Right, you can't do that
Because I'm just talking celsus
That's all I'm doing
Jesus himself was thought to work wonders
By the use of magic and incantations
And interestingly enough, notice that the two are separate
And right away, you and I, children of the modern era
We don't know why those should be separate
We don't know what the difference between magic and incantations is
We don't know if this is part of healing religion
We don't know what this is, we don't know where the drugs are
We don't know what the visions are, we know they're having visions
Profits, they're producing profits
Oh my goodness
I'm going to give you one more
Only because I know you love it
You guys have a sick fascination
A sick fascination
It's like getting down to that original peel
You ever pick it, pick it somebody else's scabs?
Yeah
You don't necessarily have to
You get down to that lower level
It's that fresh, invigorated flesh
It's got that blood of death
That's what we call it, we don't call it the mixture of life
We call it that which brings death
Salasimmon Heima
Okay, you're getting a little bit into there
Into their world
So says Celsus
One ought first to follow reason as a guide
Before accepting any belief
Thank you, I told him that
I told him that, I told him that's what the devil wanted
And here you are, Celsus
I agree with you, Celsus, good man
Good man, typical, nice pagan
Love to meet his parents, this is wonderful
One ought first to follow reason as a guide
Before accepting any belief
Since anyone who believes without testing a doctrine
Is certain to be deceived
Come on guys, be scientists
There's no problem, no problem
We have plenty of examples in our own time
Look at who he starts to compare them with
Sibli, the Seussayers, the worshipers of Mithras
Sibasius, wait a minute
You mean all of these mystery cults
That we've been talking about?
You mean there's an ancient person
Who is comparing Christianity?
No, he's not comparing Christianity
He's saying Christianity is one mystery practice
Yeah, so
When you say that the early Christians
Are using magic and Paul is running around
With his, you know, he's like, you bend over
Let me make you stop using your books
Like some kind of sick, you know, school principle
You know what I'm talking about, that kind
That kind
Yeah, Celsus and these guys are noticing these things
Right, they're noticing it
Look, you know, these people should be ashamed
For a lot of the stuff they're doing
Right, a lot of the stuff, yeah
Excellent, I want to, just in case
Look, in case there was anybody sitting here
Who still is in that one section
In the nosebleed section
That we reserved for the true believers
You know, that section has always got to be made available
Right, or we're not going to have any sort of progress
So we've got that section available
For anybody in that section who is still
In the least sympathetic to the fact
That Jesus is arrested in a public park with a naked boy
Okay
I want to give you the words of a dead pagan
Who said everybody knows what they do with the boys
Christians included
Don't you see?
The cult of Jesus is the cult of Antinois
Heracles, here he is, isn't he hot?
Here he is, you know who this is?
This is Antinois
He's a real person, right?
We don't think that you're sitting around
We don't spend any time in myth
We're with real people, baby
We're with Queens, Amazonian Queens and Antinois
Can I get him back for me?
Let me summon Antinois back, look at this
I want you guys to get, I want you to feel it
As you're sitting on that throne, right?
As you're sitting on that throne, look at him
Look at him, just feel Antinois
Antinois, you know who he was?
He was the boy-lover of Hadrian
Whom he picked up and brought back for his education
Look, everybody knew nothing was hidden
Because nobody cared
Yeah, nobody cared
Uh-huh, nobody cared
So we have a pagan who says, hey, this is your Jesus
Your Jesus, they celebrate, those Christians are doing
Let me just read it, let me just read it to you
Chewy, give him some stuff to get the brain going
Yeah
The honor they pay to Jesus is no different
From the sort paid to Hadrian's favorite boy, Antinois
Yes, did Jesus have a male-lover
With whom he was in a pederastic relationship?
That's the question that we're asking now
Sitting in this conference room, we want to know
Look, we've got a trans-dimensional stuff that's going to come through the pipe
And we've got to let them know where we are
And I'm saying part of this investigation has to do with the naked kid in the public park
Part of it has to do with the guy who was caught touching children aggressively
And had the whole group of parents say, stop
And he stood up and said, where are you going to scandalize me?
You want to scandalize me?
I am not a lacedace
Yeah, okay
And you say, how long did it take for that crowd to form when Jesus was getting taken off to get crucified?
How long did those guys show up? How bad did they punch him in the face?
Okay, he got crucified between two other ones, huh?
Alright, interesting, interesting
Let me read that again
The honor they pay to Jesus is no different from the sort paid to Hadrian's favorite boy, Antinois
Now, you're saying naked boy, naked boy with Jesus in a garden, right?
Public part
Give me another one, right?
We have to build, we're building a picture, so we need things like motive
We need to construct motive based upon evidence and only from evidence that we've got
We have this 16th chapter of Mark, where guess what?
Another Neoniscos comes in
And by the way, let me just put this down here, Paul
Take down your pants
Nope, I don't know, huh?
Paul, that's not how it works, right?
Daddy says, Paul, daddy says
Take them down
Okay, the reason we have to do that is because somebody has snuck in
And I said that naked kid that was with Jesus cannot be a kid
He's got to be a 30 year old mature male undergoing a weekend seminar in a cemetery
Neoniscos, the word for young man in Greek is neonias
When you put the sigma kappa onto it, you've created a different word
Because sigma kappa is a diminutive, it's what we call diminutive
So in Greek, you have a pice, a child
And then you have a paediscos
What is a child?
What is a paediscos?
It's a diminutive for child
A little kiddo
A little kiddo, right?
So you also have a neonias, a young man, and you have a neoniscos
A boy
Yeah, he's with his boy
We're going to find another one
Let's go with Mary, quick
Everybody in the machine, we're catching up with Mary, Magdalene, Salome
Nobody asked her to dance, please
We don't know who's who
All we know is the name is a drug
And it's a sex drug too
So let's not get in too deep
Right in this limo as we all jump in Mary Magdalene's limo
Let's not get too deep because the stuff is going to get heated
It's going to get heated
I want to take you to chapter 16 of Mark
And I'm just going to translate to you
I'm going to translate to you
And here's the text, you know, yeah, yeah, you like it
Wonderful, wonderful, isn't it gorgeous?
Okay, show them the next one
It's a pretty long chapter, right?
And there's problems, people don't like this chapter, it doesn't
It doesn't fit well, there's manuscript problems
There's some funny things in here that don't make us a little bit uncomfortable
That's what I want to see, right?
As an investigator, that's what you want to see
You want to go in that limo with those stars
And you want to see what's going on
Give me some, can I have some of that?
Let me see, yeah
And so when Sabbath was over, I'm just reading to you from the Greek
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jacob
And Salome, what did they do?
They scored some aromata
They got some drugs
They got some drugs, they aggarized some drugs
They went to the market, got some drugs, don't you like that?
Why?
In order that they might treat his body
Yeah, yeah
They're going to put some stuff on him
They're going to alepho him
They're not going to Christ him
They're going to alepho him, his body
Right, he's dead now, right?
Okay, fantastic, nothing new to see here
And really early in the morning on the first day of Sabbath
They came to his monument
Yeah, that's his, you know, tomb
Monument tomb, yeah
They came to his tomb, the tomb
The most talked about tomb and history
What was found in the most talked about tomb and history?
A wee boy, a wee boy
Yeah, watch what he's wearing too
He's party freak, watch this
So early on, they get on it
They're getting there right when the sun is rising, right?
And they started discussing among themselves
And said, who's going to move that giant rock
That's in front of the door of the tomb?
Right, they didn't bring anybody with them
Because it's big rock, right?
Big rock, got to roll it away
And so as they're discussing, they look up
And what happens, what do they see?
They see that somebody's rolled that thing away, right?
And it's big, exceptionally big, they say
Whoo, yeah, good, good, good
It's got some manly business, right?
Love it, love it, somebody's in the background
Somebody's in the background
And going in, here we go
Are you ready to go into Jesus' tomb?
Are you ready?
Most famous tomb in history
I'm delighted to be able to give you a tour
Of the tomb of Jesus, all a mark
And a little bit of celsus in the background
Here we go, going into the tomb
They saw what? A Nea Nisgun
Are you kidding me?
They saw a Nea Nisgun, what is he doing?
He's got themen on, he's sitting in
Deck sea ice pit
Wait, wait, what?
He's sitting on the right side
He's sitting on the right hand
He's sitting on the right hand of whom?
No, it just stops
He's sitting on the right hand of
Somebody or something
Or some corpse
Sitting on the right hand of it
Which is the cult mystery position
Love it, love it
What's this kid doing there?
Let's see what happens, let's see what happens
What does he say? He's sitting on the right hand
Oh, he's wearing a stolled nail kit
He's wearing the white robes of an initiate
Do you love that?
Can you smell the drugs that are in the air already?
If you don't, it's too late and you're about to go nuts
I'm not kidding, I'm not kidding
Have you ever been to one of these cemetery rituals?
Here we go, yeah
And he says to them, yeah
Don't, the kid speaks up
He says, don't be afraid
Don't be amazed
Because they're shocked
Why are they shocked?
They're walking to a tomb
There's a kid sitting there
It might be in too loud
He says, shut up, old man
You're being loud
But is there, what's the kid doing?
I'm sorry, I get so excited
When these kids get involved with Jesus
Can we see that kid with Jesus again?
Look at Jesus' face here, people
Come on, look at him
That's a man who knows
He's about to get scandalized
You know what I mean?
That's a man who knows
He's been touching like he shouldn't
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ
Yeah, yeah
Both of those are titles
Thank you very much
Okay, and he says to them, don't be afraid
He says, you're looking for Jesus
The Nazarene
Yeah, what is he doing?
The one that was crucified
That's what he says
Look, this is the one
You know, the one that was crucified
Well, he opened his eyes
He what?
Yeah
He opened his eyes
And then the Greek says
And everybody translates that
Do we have that one?
Everybody translates this
As that one
Yeah, there we go
Everybody translates this
I just want you to see
It's a demonstrative adverb
Look at the top
Demonstrative adverb of hode
Hode is just such a one
Right, so it's the demonstrative adverb form of that
So in this way, or thus, you know
Thusly, look at number two
Of a state or condition, as it is
I like you for who you are
For who you are is this hode
The thing sitting there as it is
What does the kid say?
Kid said, Jesus has gotten up
He's not this thing sitting here
Oh my God, did he just point to the corpse?
Did he just point to the corpse
And say that, no, no, no
He's been woken up
He's new
This is not him
Oh my goodness
That thing is translated traditionally as an adverb
He's not here
He's not here
But why is the boy sitting on the right hand
Of somebody who's not there?
Fantastic
And what is that kid doing?
And why is he dressed up?
Why is he dressed up like an initiate?
This is getting ridiculous
If we were cops
If we were cops, we would say, okay
There's a pattern
You think so?
Hand me those donuts over there
Hand me those donuts
You know what?
As I'm eating my donut
I'm thinking we're seeing a pattern
We're seeing a guy who gets arrested
In the company
He gets impeded
He gets somebody comes in
And he's there with a kid
Whether it's in a dark place late at night
Or whether he travels up
Somebody's rich tomb
And spends a couple of days with their kid
Is anybody seeing a pattern?
He called himself
He said, Jesus Christ said
I am not a child trafficker
I am not a child trafficker
I am Jesus Christ
I am not a child trafficker
Do not scandalize me
I am Jesus Christ
I am not a child trafficker
Do not scandalize me
For touching children
You know, the last person that corpse talked to
Was that kid
I'd like to know
I'd like to know
But before you think this is over
Now I'm bringing in the drugs
Are you ready for this?
Remember, in the tomb
That sacred place
Where that body is
Where those necromancers perform their rite
Yeah
They also burn incense
Yeah
They also burn incense
Okay
Wait a minute
What?
And it's called fumigation, brah
It's called fumigation
Every death is full of it
You've got to purify the area
You've got to get rid of those demons
You've got to get rid of those demons
Right?
So what happens?
Let's watch what happens in the next
In the next, yeah, yeah, yeah
So they got up early in Sabbath and they went
And Mary saw, right?
He went to her first
Anyway, I want to get when they're running out
Yeah
And so he says to them, you know
Behold Jesus, the Nazarene
You know what I mean?
The one who's crucified, he's up
And this is in him
This form is in him
Look at the place where he's buried
But they said to the students of him
Go out and say to the students in Peter
To bring yourselves, right?
To Galilee
He's going to go before you
He's going to go into Galilee
Wait, what?
Jesus said to him
He's going to go into Galilee
He's going to go before you
He's going to go into Galilee
Wait, what?
Jesus is going into Galilee
Okay
Okay
And then what's the very next sentence?
And they went out and fled in terror
They're tromos
They're shaking
They're shaking
It says they ran away
They ran away and refused to even tell anyone
About what happened, right?
Mary Magdalene, right?
Salome, a couple others
And they're standing there
And they see this kid
And all of a sudden a terror hits them
A terror hits them
I wonder what they were fumigating that place with
Was it something ecstatic?
Was it something that they were using?
And you think, oh no
Watch, I want to catch you
Now I'm going to chain you up
And I'm going to spank you
You say, no, no, they didn't
It wasn't, they weren't using those drugs
No, they couldn't have
We couldn't have gone there
Yes, take a look at what the Greek says
Right?
Says they were tromos
They had a shake
And they were in ecstasy
They were in ecstasy
They were in ecstasy
No, this is Christian
These cannot be those rites of the pagans
No, well guess what?
Mary got high
In Jesus' tomb
She became ecstatic
This is when you start seeing visions and stuff
What do you think that kid was doing sitting there?
Right?
You got to see those visions
You see the system that was around Jesus
And the performance of his mystery
Do you see the system that was functioning
That was operating?
Right?
That kid was there for a reason
And Celsus is screaming at the world
Look, they're no different
They do the same things
They reverence Jesus as they reverence Antinois
Antinois!
What is Hadrian doing with Antinois?
What is Heracles doing with Highless?
Yeah, and what is Jesus doing with the naked boy?
We're building a picture of the actuality
And now, just to finish off
I just want to play this
I want to roll this film clip
One more time, this little clip
And I want you to think about
What period of time you're inhabiting
And I want you to think about
Whether or not time is a river or a cycle
Let's hit it, please
This fight has come to us
And you know what I say?
Bring it on!
No homos will ever be allowed on this church
As long as it's on the pastor here
To let you know that verse one is the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
So help you God when you understand faith
The devil's hoping you don't know who you are
What is the deliverance that Jesus Christ has on you?
In a few years they'll die out
Do you know why they can't reproduce?
Cancer! Cancer! All the pain is gone!
We've prepared, birds prepare, eagles don't prepare
We've said hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah!
Jesus would say to our politicians today
Who are telling us what light bulbs we can and can't use
But they won't say don't murder your children
Someone who was so deeply into paganism as to do this
Was restricted from the privileges and rights of citizenship
But in the nation because they had defiled the image of God
This is how your breathing hell was like
They toppled civilization and issued in dark ages
Now they have the power to destroy everything
Look at where you are in history
Thank you for coming tonight
I will be a few minutes at the discord tonight
To chat with people and throw around for people to throw around ideas
It's a great place to come to throw around your ideas
Yeah, and maybe tonight we'll drop some cells
Maybe not, but please, please
As we go through this material, take it seriously
Because this is the reality that we have now at present
This is our reality
We have to do what's right, guys
We have to defend that space
We have to keep these texts
Have a good week
Hail Satan
We wish you a Merry Christmas
