I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' to keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should've said
And so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows
When I say, never was the cause for the long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is our 30-minute Thursday night Bible study
And tonight I'm gonna take you somewhere that you haven't yet been
This is gonna be fun
We'll also have a couple of clips of Derek Lambert from MythVision
And I wanna look at a couple of things that he said in a recent video
Just emphasize those great points that he's making
After that we'll talk about Pliny
Bring him back from the dead
We'll look into some of the deepest, darkest, confusing bits of gospel that you'll ever see
On Lady Babylon tonight
So I'll also have a little appearance tomorrow night
On Gnostic Informant we'll be talking about drugs
Talking about the drugs of antiquity
A topic that nobody ever, ever wants to talk about
Classicists included
Classicists included
It's getting a little bit better
A professor from Brown told me it'll take people 10 years to catch up
And then once they do it'll take off
Well, it's been about 12 years now
So we ought to be making some progress in the field of ancient drugs
Try going for fun
Try going to your preacher, pastor, minister, priest
Try going to one of those people and asking them
What do you know about drugs?
When they tell you they don't know anything, if they're honest
You can just say a book of thanks for being honest
But when they try to bring up the topic of a goat
Ignore them, run, run, you're in the wrong place
That's the only back alley they can find to catch you
And is that goat, that goat a sacrifice?
It has nothing to do with anything, anything
Especially not the language
They love to dance around those silly poles all the time
It's hilarious
Let's get on with a couple of clips tonight
Of myth vision
Derek has hit a couple of points this week
That I was just like, hey, kudos to this man
Kudos to him and what he is doing
There's an honor, a real honor in this
He has really captured the Satanic spirit
Yeah, he's on fire with it
Chewie hit us
He's just saying we're at a battle here in terms of ideologies
Which affect all sorts of other things
From politics, ethics, you name it
Do you want to see the world become a better place?
I do
And I am in no way saying we need to shut down all religion
Or people should not be allowed to practice them
Fundamentalism is an absolute opposition, in my opinion
To being able to freely think
Fundamentalism, notice he said fundamentalism
Not one type of fundamentalism
But fundamentalism in general
Is an enemy of the old thought box
Yeah, hence the old argument
Why are you worshiping nature?
You don't need that nature stuff
We've got creed
Yeah, that's what Mr. Lambert in all of his
He's having all of his guests on
He's got experts, he's got access to them
And you can see he's growing
You see the same thing in Gnostic Informant
They're outgrowing their tutors
Yeah, they're outgrowing their tutors
They're essentially getting an education
And they're outgrowing their tutors and they're seeing
This is a war, this is a war
Yeah, beautiful, let's roll that second clip
Because Christians don't do that
When they're doing the claims for other deities
They don't believe those things are all true
But theirs they do
Muslims are doing the same thing with their particular worldview
They have their own spin
Not interested
So help us with this battle, this war
By liking the videos of the content creators you like
By sharing the content out there as far and as wide as you can
Leaving a comment goes a very far distance
In helping the algorithm pay attention
Even if it is just a comment
Here's one for the algorithm
Because we have such large Christian apologetic channels
That get all this attention
There's really an ideological war going on
To speed up the process
And make this material more broad and more public
That's how you can help
There is an ideological war going on
He's talking about YouTube
Yeah, yeah
This is a man who has worked the front line
And seized the front line for what it is
Yeah, do you see the energy in him?
The zeal?
This smacks of the ancient museum
I can smell it
I can smell the ancient museum
No matter what you fundamentalists do
No matter what you indoctrinated
Dogmatic, orthodoxic, hegemonic, theocratic people do
The museum will persist
You can burn all of our scrolls
You can take all the books out of circulation
You will not stop, reason
You won't stop us
This is beautiful
Kudos to Derek Lambert, Miss Vision
Yeah, he's right there with war
This is Field of Mars
Oh, love it
Love it, love it, love it
Let's go tonight to our first little bit of jaunt
Back into the history
We're going to be doing Bible study tonight
I'm going to take you to the proto-Evangelian
The infancy gospel of James
We're going to look at a section that makes no sense
In the English
That's because the translation is terrible
But first, we're going to start with some plenty
And you'll notice I'm giving you all of plenty in English
Yeah, yeah, think about that
There's a good reason
The Latin comes across much more clearly
You can refine it with technical adjustments
But as my students who are learning both languages now
As they're going to see
As they're going to start to develop
Different forms of communication
There's different levels of thinking
And with the ancient Greeks
Sometimes we can get so lost
In the Orphic analog
That we lose sight of what's going on
That's right, tonight's text is full
It's full of Orphic radiation
You're going to love it
First, we've got to go through a little background with plenty
Hit that first plenty
Yeah
I should have been inclined to think that Orpheus
Had been the first to introduce into a country snow in Arizona
Certain magical superstitions based upon the practice of medicine
Right off the bat
Right off the bat, we have an association with medicine and magic
Plenty just hits this over and over and over and over again
You have to realize you cannot separate the drugs and the magic
You can't
When he says medicine
Those things that are given
Medeo to put you in a state of wellness
Yes, he's talking about drugs
He's talking about pharmacy
Sorcery, it's why we call it
You know, all the pharmacone roots we translate
Sorcery, sorcery
Right
Drugs and magic are one
Let's go to the next quote
For the art of magic is a fact beyond all doubt
Though at the same time, I would remark that in the most ancient times
And when Plenty says ancient times, he's talking about bronze age
He's talking about his antiquity
And indeed, by the way, his first century
And indeed, almost invariably, it was in this branch of science that was sought
The highest point of celebrity and of literary renown
At all events, Pythagoras we find
Empedocles, Democritus and Plato
Cross the seas in order to attain a knowledge thereof
And you say to yourself, Democritus, what did Democritus give us?
He's that pre-Socratic philosopher who gave us the atom
Yeah, your concept
Everything that modern physics is based on
It's a conception from the mind of a pre-Socratic philosopher
Who studied and wrote about magic extensively
Extensively
Good, good
Let's get another quote from Plenty
It was Democritus, too, who first drew attention to Apollo beckys of Comptos
To Dardanus and to Phoenix
The works of Dardanus, and yes, that's the famous Dardanus who we call the Greeks after
We call them Dardanians
Yes, that's him
He sought in the tomb of that personage
You always bury your magic scrolls with you
Numus doing it for a reason
And his own were composed in accordance with the doctrines there found
Give me one more, give me one more text
There is also a marvelous coincidence in the fact that the two arts, medicine, I mean magic
Were developed simultaneously
Medicine by the writings of Hippocrates and magic by the works of Democritus
So right away they should throw you a little bit
Wait a minute, the origins of that Greek literary magic
Where we have books that contain these magical principles and premises and spells and incantations and hymns
That all of these things literally go back to a pre-socratic wave of renaissance-like thought
Yes, they do, they do
But we'll see that the earlier forms of this that come from this Persian magus
That these Medo-Persian magus
These forms are ultimately where Pliny is going to say all of this interaction took place with the drugs
All of this knowledge
Pliny tells us about the magi using drugs to interrogate
And he says they have wonderful drugs for causing you to hallucinate
For you to be able to see things that are horrific, that are incredibly scary
And all the magus has to do who's performing the interrogation is to give you the drug
And then for himself to take in the demon, the daimon
And to express that daimon to this drugged person
And that person will tell you the truth as they perceive it
They will reflect what exactly they perceive
It's amazing, it's amazing technology
So Pliny tells us that the magi do this, they're the best interrogators and they work against conspiracies
You want to find out what the other conspirators are?
Drug the guy that you catch and get their names and locations
So what does that have to do with the Bible study?
What does that have to do with the Bible study?
Of course, the evangelicals are not going to know this
The guys at the seminary who claim to be Greek experts are not going to know this
Why? Because the only thing they ever read was their own little text
And when you do that, you don't develop a vocabulary
You develop an inbred, two-headed, three-eyed monster
It's disgusting, it's disgusting
Don't tell me you can translate those texts, you can't
I'll take any of you on
Yeah, breathe heavy, heavy breathing
I'm sorry, it gets me gassed though
What does this have to do with the Bible?
Devils only give me another quarter of an hour
So what does this have to do with the Bible?
Let's run to the text now
Chewie, get us quick to a star system that has the next set of quotes in it
Here we go, perfect, nice
Look at this, here we are in the sixth month of her pregnancy
That's Mary, Mary, I told you this had something to do with the Bible
Joseph came from his house building and went into the house to find her swelling
And he struck his face and threw himself on the ground and sandcloth and wept bitterly
How can I look to the Lord God?
What will I pray about her for?
I took her as a virgin from the temple of the Lord and did not guard her
Who has set this trap for me?
Who did this evil in my house?
I want to come back to this but I want to stop there and just comment on it
You see what's happening, he's saying, who came in and raped my virgin?
Somebody came in and raped my virgin, I'm in trouble now, I'm supposed to be guarding this virgin
And as she's pregnant, who did this?
Who stole this virgin from me and defiled her?
Has not the story of Adam been repeated with me?
For while Adam was glorifying God, the serpent came and found Eve alone and deceived her and defiled her
So it's happened to me.
Did you hear what he just said?
He's saying that Eve was entered into sexual intercourse with, you know who, serpent himself
Everybody knows he's the hottest, you didn't know that all of Genesis came down to one fact
That Eve saw the hotter of the two choices and ended up having intercourse
Now this doesn't strike me as odd, it does a lot of people that Eve would be having sex with the devil
Right, but we know that the devil used to scrape his skin and put it in her water
Yeah, isn't that cool?
Now if you were covered in paint and psychedelic paint and you were going to influence someone
To try to bring that sting of air off to them?
Right, that's why we have air off in front today
If you're going to try to bring that sting to them, you can do it with a drug
You can do it
Isn't that, that's hasperous, gorgeous, gorgeous, right?
That evening star
We all know, what did people say?
Hey, Neil and Derek, you guys have a lot of shows with experts and I talk a lot about the devil
Now once, have I heard any of these people talk about how hot the devil was?
The devil was the best looking of everybody
This is a doneness for a reason
Do you see it?
Do you see the morning star?
Now I'm giving you the images that those of you who have ears to hear will be able to know exactly where we are
Okay, let's go, next quote, we've got to hustle through this
And the High Priest said to her, Mary, what is this?
How have you humiliated yourself? Did you forget the Lord your God?
You were raised in the Holy of Holies and received from the hand of an angel? Wait, what?
Yeah, it looks at the Greek, it's very the same thing
It's literally you're nourished, you were grown
You were grown in the Holy of Holies, not just the temple, it doesn't say the temple
In what the Greeks called the Ataton, the inner space where you met with the God
That's where she was raised
That's where she was raised, she made the purple and the scarlet dies for the threads
Beautiful, beautiful, okay, that's the same quote we need to
You heard their songs and danced before them, what?
You heard their songs and danced before them?
Maybe that's why he's talking about the dancing and the chorus
For the temple
Oh, it's beautiful, look at the Jews performing these rites
The rites of a pagan mystery
You would think, you would think their history would have stopped them
But it didn't, it didn't
And that's how we get to this quirky scene that nobody can explain
The English translations are terrible, keep going to the next, what's our next?
Here we go, okay, so what's gonna happen, right? The High Priest is found out
The High Priest is found out that Mary's pregnant
And he summoned Joseph and Mary, right?
Kaip and Jochielos, and so the High Priest says
Ap-O-Dos-Ten-A-Parthenon
Give me back my girl, give me back the virgin
Notice he's still calling her a virgin, right?
Yeah, the virgin whom you took from the temple of the Lord
And so, I'm reading this literally
And so, Joseph stood there and started crying
I'm sorry, he started crying
Okay, Kaip, so, you know, probably because he's scared, right?
He defiled the virgin, the temple
My God, man, that can't be good
Kaip and Jochielos, and so the High Priest says to him
I am going to make you drink the water of the judgment of the Lord
And it will make clear your wrongdoings in your eyes
Take that off for a minute
It will make clear your wrongdoings in your eyes
Now, in a minute, he's gonna untie them both, right?
If you read this in English, it makes no sense
It makes absolutely no sense because
And this is where we on Satanic initiation will benefit so much
What they do is they follow the actual analog
They follow the metaphor, right?
And they say, Joseph goes off through the wilderness
He comes back and everything's fine
They're following the analog, right?
Listen to it with your ears
It's a drug interrogation
Okay, so he's gonna give you
And that thing that he says he's going to give him
Is a title for a drug
The judgment of God
Yes, you know what the judgment of God is?
It's a drug
The love of God
The love of God
Let me say that again
The love of God is the name of an ancient drug
Do you know what it's made of?
It's Jesus's semen
Yeah
Yeah, bring those tags
Bring them sh...
Bring those tags
Yeah
Let's go back to the Greek, finish this up
And the high priest took him
And forced him to drink
And when it says it took him, that's really like
Capturing him
Like taking a hold of, putting hands on him
And he forces him to drink
He forces him to drink
What does he force him to drink?
What he told him, he's going to force him to drink
Kai Epimpson, he sent him out
Into the wilderness
Where is it? What's the wilderness?
The wilderness is that place
Where you are tempted
It is literally
Here, this use of the word
Is that borderland
In Egypt they referred to it this way
It's that desert borderland
In Greece, different parts of Greece
You could talk about the
Inlands of the hills
The wild hill country
As that wilderness
As that wilderness
Yes
Let's go, that was six minutes
And so, yeah
And so what else did he do?
And he, Kai Elthen, right?
So he comes back
And he's holocleros
He's holocleros
That word, kleros
Is the word
For lot
Yes
His lot is whole
He comes back
He hasn't untied him yet
He hasn't let him go
He sends him into the wilderness
With this solution
That he makes him drink, specifically drink
And he comes back holocleros
True to
The sorte
True to the
The randomization
Of reality
This is drug talk, these are necromancers
These magi are doing these interrogations
These are necromancers, brah
This high priest
The dude's a necromancer
He's a Jewish necromancer
Okay, keep going, hurry
We're gonna hurry, yeah
And so he sends the
He sends the virgin out to the wilderness too
And she comes back holocleros
Everything is fine and everybody is amazed
Because they couldn't
Find any falsehood
In the story, they didn't reveal anything
Right? And so the priest says
You know, since we can't
Bring out any
Fault, then I'm not going to
I'm not gonna contradict here
What's going on?
Yes, yes, yes, let's go to the next
Text
I just wanted you to see Kledos here
Kledos here, ah
Yes, necromanic ties
For those of you who want to pause that
And take a look at it, let's go to the next test though
I want to go back really quick
To Pliny, and I want to read this to you
The Mithridatic antidote is composed of
Four and fifty ingredients
None of what you're using exactly
The same proportion and the quantity
Prescribed is in some cases
So small as the sixtieth part
Of one denarius, that's not very much
Which of the gods pray
Can have an instructed man
And such trickery as this
A height to which the mere subtlety
Of human invention could surely never have reached
Come on, calm down, Pliny
This clearly must emanate
From a vain ostentation
Of scientific skill
And must be
Set down as a monstrous system
Yes, puffling off
The medical art
You see that, they're so
Specific with their measurements
For all of these ingredients
Right, they're just
Showing off their scientific skill
That's all they're doing
So when the priest pulls out
Water of
God's judgment
And is able to administer it
Don't let it be surprised
This knowledge is there
This knowledge is there, fantastic
I want to take you really quick
Why did we go to the Mithridatic
I want you to consider the treacle well
For everybody who's in satanic initiation
I want you to consider the treacle well
And consider it
That Lewis Carroll
Took Alice
There with her sisters in a boat
He didn't take her to the well
But he
Talked about the well
In Oxford, and he said
There are three girls that live at the bottom
Of this well, right
That treacle, that word treacle
Is based off the Greek theriac
And for those of you
Who have been paying attention
This
Explosion of knowledge
Comes partially because of what
This Carroll's advisor is doing
In classics
So if you really want to understand
Alice in Wonderland
And the use of the treacle well
You want
You want to dip
Into antiquity
Yes, and then all of a sudden
The symbols are there
And instead of saying like that
Terrible English translation
They send them off into the woods
And they came back and it makes no sense
Where's the drug involved
By the way, it says after that
He untied their hands
He released their bonds and let them go
Right, so this is exactly
It matches Pliny's
Almost
Contemporary description
Pliny's first century
This gospel is really second century
It's like 150 somewhere
Around there
So yeah
It's okay, you're within
80 years
Of each other
That's not much
So it's good
Contemporary evidence, Pliny
And the gospel is using the same
Language to illustrate
The same type of event
Yeah, it's wonderful
And what I'll do is I'll continue
With this through
Neil tomorrow
Anastic Informant tomorrow
And we'll talk about some of the hardcore
Drug texts
And what they're doing
What doctors are doing in antiquity
And kind of look at that side
That narcotic side, if you will
Of everything
I wanted to tie this all up
To a nice, with a nice bow
And say
The world that we're learning
About that's there
In the Greek
Is not the world that we're being given
There is
An ideological war
I'm in complete agreement
Derek is right
There's an ideological war going on
And that war has been going on
For a long time
And it is meant
To obscure
Reality
It is obfuscation
At its best
Christianity
As they said in antiquity
Is meant for one thing
One thing alone
Power
The acquisition of power
When you start burning down
The museum
You
Are doing so to set
Your path to power
We are in conflict
The things that I say
Are not what your preachers are going to tell you
But you should know they're out there
They're out there and they're real
And we have a duty
We have a duty as servants of the muse
We have a duty to protect those texts
And those who claim to be guardians
Who have taken these New Testament texts
And say these are ours
You seminarians, you priests
Shame on you
For letting your guard down
Shame on you
For claiming
Your expertise when you have
None
It's disgusting
Long live the muse
Hail Satan
