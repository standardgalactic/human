Thank you.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon.
It's good to see you guys here tonight.
We have a great, great, short Bible study for you tonight.
And we're so privileged to have two guests, two special guests.
Now it didn't, it takes a lot to bring them, but tonight we're going to have, I'm pointing
over here because I've got them both tied up on the floor, tonight we're going to have
Billy Graham.
Yes.
Welcome.
Welcome the ghost of Billy Graham.
And of course, as usual, our friend, Dr. Young, who won't be saying anything due to his ball
gag.
So without any further ado, in order to get to the Ionic life, let us now turn to Billy
Graham.
Billy, bring it.
Oh, come on, Billy.
Oh, I can feel you, buddy.
I can feel you.
Bring me.
Bring me Ionic life, Billy.
What must I do to have eternal life?
The greatest problem in the world today is sin.
What causes people to hate and lust and have greed?
It's sin.
It's a disease that we all have.
The Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
You've missed the mark.
You've broken the law on your way to spiritual death and eternal death and to judgment.
But Jesus said, I can do something about that.
I can change your life.
I can make you a new person.
Jesus demanded that we make a choice.
He says there are two roads of life, the broad road and the narrow road, and you must too.
There are two destinies, heaven and hell.
Which road are you on?
Which master are you serving?
I don't have to be touched.
I don't have to go to hell.
I don't have to be lost.
My soul has been redeemed.
I'm going to heaven.
I've got to first repent of my sin and receive Christ as my Lord and my Savior.
You have to repent of your sins.
That means to be willing to change your way of living.
You may have no power to do it, but if you surrender to Christ, he'll give you the power.
How many of you here tonight are broken?
Fed up, but you don't know what to do.
You give your life to Christ tonight and you will have supernatural help in breaking those
chains that bind you.
God's not waiting to judge you.
God's not waiting to condemn you.
He's waiting to receive you with mercy, with love, with open arms and forgive all your sins.
You know, there only comes a few times in our lives when Jesus in Nazareth passes by
and we have an opportunity like we have tonight to receive Him.
You may never have it tomorrow, as far as God is concerned.
There are people here tonight that may never be alive tomorrow.
You may never get off school again like this, or your heart may not be this tender to God.
Come while you can, and don't put it off.
God is waiting to welcome you with open arms, to receive you as you come to Him in repentance
and faith.
A symbol, and yet could be life changing tonight, and all of heaven will rejoice.
And with such power, Billy Graham brought you eternal life, eternal life.
Can we see?
Can we see John 3.16, please?
Can we see John 3.16?
Everybody together is opening reading tonight in this Bible study.
Let's look at John 3.16.
This is the first time I've ever seen John 3.16 in my life, and I've never seen John 3.16.
John 3.16.

Coral John.

John 3.15.
translated to you as eternal.
And tonight, what I want to show you
is the world where eternal life doesn't exist.
It's nowhere in the Bible.
It is not a promise of eternal life.
It is a promise of Ionic life.
What is this thing?
Let's see.
Let's see an excellent false derivation of that.
More eternal life.
Bring us, bring it on.
You ghosts of the dead, bring on more eternal life.
And our life is there for life to the food, to the food.
And they shall never perish.
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
The Bible says, barely, barely, I say in thee,
he that heareth my word and believeth on him
that sent me hath everlasting life
and shall not come into condemnation,
but is passed from death unto life.
Jesus said, and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die.
Believe us out this.
And if you believe on Christ, you'll never die.
There's some people think eternal life means life
that goes on and on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
So the life they have now doesn't end.
They think life that just continues and doesn't stop.
No, eternal life is the rendering,
is the English rendering of the Greek Zoe.
Eternal life is used in the English language
to describe the life that only belongs
to the eternal.
The truth is the way of eternal life.
We need to be able to follow it.
Eternal life, eternal life.
Eternal life, eternal life, eternal life.
Only such.
Whoever believes in him should not perish
but have eternal life.
Do not keep that life changing truth to yourself.
And remember, you are love.
You are indeed.
Now, what is this thing they're talking about,
this Ionic life, and does it mean eternal?
Let us just go to the Ion.
The best place to go is back to the original.
Go back to Alice.
And by the way, does anybody notice
how that preacher just snuck in a little bit of Greek?
And to you, it's believable, right?
To anybody who spends time reading Greek,
it's transparently bad.
Yeah, Zoe, let's eternal life, Zoe.
Thank you.
Let's go to Ion and see what is this thing Ionic life?
What is it?
Let's go to Ion.
Okay, please, beautiful.
Back to Alice, Alice.
Tell us, Alice, Ion.
Oh, lifetime, life, age, generation, long space of time.
Ion personified as the child of Chronos.
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.
I want you to look at just one word in Greek.
And let's bring up the Ion, big Ion.
Show us with the Derivate.
Oh, okay, okay, look at this, look at this, look at this.
Oh, this is gorgeous.
Look right in the middle here,
right here in space and time.
This way, look right here.
This is Ion, Ion, Alpha, Iota,
and what is that F looking thing?
That's a diagramma.
Can you say diagramma?
Yes, you know what that diagramma is?
It is from the Mycenaean Greek.
This is a very, very old word, Ion.
And where does it come from?
From 1600 BC?
Yes, wow.
Gorgeous, gorgeous.
Oh, is that lovely?
What is the, what is the Ion?
What is the Ion?
Before we can show you the Ion,
we have to step over the cadavers,
the terrible, terrible misconceptions and lies
that you have been fed by people
who's pretend to know Greek and tell you,
oh, it's from the Greek and it means this.
And they do not know it.
Can I get a Hail Satan?
Let's see it.
Let's see them in their foolery.
Let's go.
Please show us the,
Chewick, show us the false derivation,
the third clip that we've got, yeah.
If you know very much about the story of the Bible,
you've probably heard that Jesus offers eternal life.
Sounds nice, but what does Jesus mean by eternal life?
Well, Jesus adopted this phrase from the Hebrew scriptures.
In English, it's translated eternal life
or sometimes everlasting life.
But the phrase literally translated from Hebrew
is life unto the age.
Yeah.
Yeah, seriously?
Did he just say that?
It's adopted from the Hebrew
and you people just sit there, uh-huh, uh-huh.
It's adopted from the Hebrew.
I just showed you the Mycenaean.
The proto-Hebrew is the earliest 9th century BC.
This is not Hebrew.
This is not Semitic.
This is Greek in its oldest form,
at least the oldest recovered form of Ramsophon, right?
Let me, I think it's going to be back.
Let them, let them work on their end.
So the proto-Hebrew is,
to say that this is derived from Hebrew
is tantamount to taking you in a back alley
and having way with you.
Yes, very bad.
Shame on these people.
Shame on these people.
And why do people believe this?
Because we have to.
If it logically works out within the Judeo-Christian mystery,
the languages have to follow each other
and that original source has to be Hebrew.
They can't live, their universe shatters without that.
The Masoretic sect in the 10th century
starts crying out from their graves,
oh, we created you a text.
And that tradition has bound you for a thousand years.
Yes, yes, it's time to wake up.
What is the ion?
Where do we always go here at Lady Babylon?
We go to the Medwa, right?
We go to the Arians who call themselves the Medoi.
Yes, all because of this one woman.
Where else would we go?
Where else is interesting except Lady Babylon?
Seriously.
Love it, love it.
Okay, tonight I'd like to bring you a text
where we can see the ion
and to show you that it has been poorly, poorly,
terribly mistranslated and criminally perhaps as eternal.
Yes, eternal.
Seriously, guys.
Okay, let me pull up the Medea text.
This is the fourth Pythian ode.
And it is a record of Medea's Oracle.
Of Medea's Oracle, beautiful.
Thank you very much, Chewie.
So what is, take it down for a second.
What is Medea's Oracle?
Medea's Oracle as well.
It's one of the Oracles of Medea
that she handed down from Thera, Santorini.
Woo!
And this was before the explosion.
Yeah.
Anyway, she handed down this Oracle of the future
that was kept by the Pythia.
That's awesome.
Was kept by the Pythia and the Pythia went ahead
and released it when the inquiry was there
that was relevant to the Oracle.
It was about the founders of Cyrene
and some stuff in Northern Africa, good stuff.
Anyway, so this is Pindar's record
of that Oracle.
And in it, we have the word Ion.
And I just wanted you guys to see what the Ion is.
You know, Ion is Hera.
Hera is making sure, let's bring up the Greek.
Hera is making sure that everybody is falling in love
with Jason's ship, wants to go on the Argo.
And what are they sailing to do, right?
He doesn't want them to, third line down,
third line down on this one.
I just want to show you the Ion.
Where'd you go?
There we go.
Second line, one, two, three, four, five, six,
word in, Iona, okay?
So there we are.
And he doesn't want them to have,
to be staying there with their mothers.
Hera doesn't want them to be staying there
with their mothers.
Having an Ion Akin Dunon.
What is Akin Dunon?
That's something that lacks any sort of danger.
Lacks any sort of danger.
Hera wants you to go on the Argo
because she doesn't want you to sit at home with your mommy.
Living an Ion that is without danger.
Living an Ion that is without danger.
Now, what's funny is further down the line,
a la evi caitanatoy.
Despite the death, even against death,
they should go to find what?
To find a Calystone Pharmacon.
To find the best, most beautiful drug.
Wait, the most beautiful drug?
Yes, the most beautiful drug.
What kind of drug?
A drug, aretas.
The most beautiful drug of virtue, of arete.
You know, you can't get that if you're sitting at home
with your mommy, says Medea.
It's good stuff.
You gotta love it.
You don't realize this stuff is written by women, right?
They're like, oh, all the literature we have is,
no, it's not, no, it's not, it's not all men, right?
There's great stuff out there, great stuff out there.
Anyway, and yes, did you notice?
What are they on the journey for?
They're on the journey for the Pharmacon.
They want that drug, that drug that leads to virtue.
So they go and kidnap Medea.
It's logical, right?
Right, she's a source.
Okay, so what I wanna do next is,
I wanted you to see that within its context.
And now I wanna go to, yes,
I guess we're going to pull up Jung now.
Let's get Jung, before we do,
can you just show the folks Jung?
And I want you to, I just want you to thank Redbook
or leave her to know him.
Now what's, and what, shut up Jung.
Read it, just read it before he, just okay,
put the text up, let's just do this.
Here we go, are you guys ready?
We're gonna be transformed.
Why is Philemon a magician?
Oh, look, it's got the root of Ammon in it.
Yeah, that's nice.
Does he conjure up immortality for himself?
Jung is listening, do you see what happens?
Jung is listening to you.
He's watching you, I told you.
Is he conjuring up immortality, a life beyond?
He was probably only a magician by profession.
And he now appears to be a pension magician.
Speak, you old fool, speak.
Who has retired from service?
I'm not that old.
He's desirousness and creative drive.
And this, do you know why I beat him now?
Now you know why I beat Jung.
I know, every once in a while it feels good.
Yes, his desirousness and creative drive have expired
and he now enjoys his well-earned rest
out of sheer incapacity.
Like every old man who can do nothing else
than plant tulips in water, his little garden.
The mat, okay, now here's where, just give it to us.
Give it to us, you dirty old man.
You dirty old man, I'm gonna tell him
what you did to your patient.
How old was she?
You creep.
Jung, the magical rod.
Now get ready, get ready for, you know,
this is the big stuff, okay, of all of you esoteric people.
Anybody who's interested in the magic and the necromancy,
watch what's going to happen.
This is gorgeousness and gorgeosity all together.
Yeah, I love this.
The magical rod, wait, huh, lies in a cupboard
together with the sixth and seventh books of Moses.
Wait, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
That's five, I thought it was called a Pentateuch.
Guess what?
Your world that you thought was so normal isn't.
There happened to be other books of Moses.
They just weren't accepted in El Canon.
Love it, okay.
We have the eight, would you like me to show you?
It survives in Greek.
Who wants to read the eight book of Moses?
You know you do.
You know you do, yeah, yeah.
Philemon has become old and so much fever-minded.
Yes, okay, so tell us, why is the rod?
The rod is laid upon the sixth and the seventh.
Perhaps it's the eighth, you could say.
What kind of rod, the serpent rod?
The serpent one that Jung brings to you
and profanes to you.
Remember, he wanted this buried with him, right?
And then released at a specific time.
What a, he's weird.
Now you know why restraints are so important with Carl.
With Dr. Jung, sorry.
Don't try to get personal.
Okay, fantastic.
Let's go on to the eighth book of Moses then.
Eighth book of Moses.
And I'm going to read you a section of that.
And you are going to perceive Ionic life.
Are you ready?
None of your people from Harvard are gonna give this to you
because they don't use these sources.
Shame on you.
When you were needed, Harvard.
Ivy League.
Nothing about the Ivy in that one.
Yeah, yeah, let's see.
Okay, I'll read it to you.
Let's see if we can find it.
I'm not quite sure which one is it.
Nope, nope.
Nope, nope.
Well, that's okay.
Take it down.
I'll read it to you, please.
Let me read it to you.
It's from the PGM.
You can get it yourself.
Hans Dieter Betz.
Yeah, it's the edition that Dr. John Scarborough
was one of the many translators for
who was the gentleman that I worked with.
Very nice, very nice.
I call on you, the creator of all,
who are greater than all.
Like that.
You, the self-begotten God,
who see all and hear all and are not seen.
Okay, do you have the mental image
this God is telling you about?
Calling on that unseen one.
For you gave Helios all the glory and the power,
slain the privilege to wax and wane,
and you have fixed the courses, yet you took nothing
from the earlier born darkness,
but assigned them equally, assigned them equality.
For when you appeared, both order arose and light appeared.
I like that, order and light appeared.
And all things were arranged by you.
Therefore, all things are also subject to you,
whose true form, none of the gods can see,
who take different forms in different visions.
Ion of Ion, Ion of Ion.
Yeah, what ground are we treading here?
We're treading here the mysteries.
And we're looking at the Ion, let's images of Ion.
Images, where are they?
Bring them up, love it, love it.
Just keep bringing them up, forgive me,
forgive me and just keep whatever you can bring up of Ion.
Yeah, you'll notice the snake association,
you'll have the robot ulcers here for all of you cats
who were interested in the dark side of the esoteric.
You'll know the images that are there,
for those of you who've been somewhat initiated.
Yeah, you'll know, you'll recognize,
you'll begin to recognize them.
Show them the serpent, right?
The serpent around Ion, right?
AKA Faneis, Faneis.
What is going on with the language?
It's the same divinity, right?
Faneis, bring them up, Faneis.
Oh, take feast your eyes on this guy, right?
With the serpent around him, he's got the wings.
Oh, you gotta love it.
Does anybody smell Saturn?
Yes, you should, because this is Saturn.
Hail Satan.
Judaism and Christianity are the children of Satanism.
Yeah, the children of Satanism.
Yeah, yeah.
There he is for you, there is Ion.
And if you go into the synagogues in Israel,
from the first, from the second and first BC,
the first and second Anno Domini,
you're gonna find Ion, you're gonna find Ion.
The worship of Saturn.
Love it, love it, love it.
It's good stuff, it's good stuff.
So, as we, I just wanna hit a couple more texts with you,
but as we wrap up then, come full circle,
this Ionic life is a part of the mystery.
The initiate who enters death
and is brought back to life is born again.
Yeah, yeah, you're born again.
Uh-huh, and that Ionic life is the state
that the initiate enters.
It is not the word eternal.
And the mistake comes through Latin.
It's the church pushing it, I will,
and what I will means,
and whether it means I turn it to us and it doesn't.
The Ion, Saturn, is outside of Kronos.
Wait, what?
Yeah, Kronos, time.
The Saturn, Satan is outside of that time.
Yeah, it is only by the castration of Uranos
that anything proceeds.
He has set that time.
Mm, I'm first and last, apocalypse.
Here we go, are you ready?
Here's the funny thing,
this Fane's Ion is bi-gendered, it's dual, dual-gendered.
Yeah, yeah, feast on that guys
with your serpents on your poles.
Feast on that, right?
Oh, gotta love it.
Bring the apocalyptic chapter in here.
I wanna, this is from the beginning of the apocalypse.
We're gonna go right there.
I'm gonna bring it up on my screen here
so it's easier on my old eyes.
Yes, mm, fantastic.
In Mesoi ton luchnion homoion huion antropon.
In the middle of these lamps was this dude
who was very much like the son of man.
Yeah, he's dressed all the way down to his feet, right?
And he's got this girdle thing
that's a bra, yeah.
He's got a bra on.
Why?
I told you, Fane's was the bi-gendered one.
Nobody ever believes me in that.
But look, here is Jesus, right?
We're talking about Jesus.
And it says in that very time
with that first line, prostos mastos, right?
Zonen, he's got the zonen, he's got the bra
and it's around his mastos, right?
It doesn't say it's around his stern, his chest.
It says it's around his breast.
It's around his breast.
And this zonen is a very important thing.
It's a ceremonial thing worn by priestesses
who are collecting the cirrus exudate
from their breasts for the sake of ritual use.
Yeah, Jesus is wearing one in the apocalypse.
Jesus is wearing one, can you believe that?
Okay, and it's anyway, verse 14, and his head, right?
He's got white hairs on his head and they're white,
like a lamb and yeah, he on like the snow
and his eyes are the flocks poros, right?
Fire, it's that eruption of fire, the flocks.
Oh, it's got so much meaning.
He's the one that you can't see, but appears.
Oh, this is fantastic.
And his feet are like bronze.
Why does he have the bronze feet?
Because she has the bronze feet.
If I show you the vampire text that I have,
if I show you the vampire text from Mike Maroulas,
who's the buddy of Vlad, the impaler,
in his perfect, perfect cult Latin, by the way,
which in 1450 or whenever he wrote this,
maybe it was before then, but for the time,
that was the most outstanding Latin
and way too close to the cult to not be
right in the big darn middle of it.
But he will tell you, and it's him to I turn it off,
he brings you the ion.
Yeah, why?
Because he's the guy who knows the purple, right?
And they use the purple, remember the wings of purple
right before the, in the Oracle of Medea.
You guys have to read this stuff.
You love it.
Pindar, Pythianodes.
Okay, let's go on with the apocalypse.
And having in his right hand, what did he have?
He had the Asteris Heptai, he had the seven stars.
Yeah, and from his stomatos, from his mouth came what?
A very sharp sword.
Yeah, very sharp.
Yeah, distomos, cutting two ways.
Woo, that's sometimes rendered as two edges, the double edge,
but it literally says cutting two ways.
Anyway, and yeah, so he's got a star in his face,
his opus, his expression, his glare with that light
that comes out of your eyes, these are all magic.
This is magic physics, right?
Yeah, what is it?
What is this glare?
It's like the Helios.
Oh, okay, wait a minute, now we're getting close to it.
Can you smell the sorcery?
Can you smell the drugs?
Can you smell what's going on in the text, right?
He's got the bronze feet and all that kind of stuff.
He's got all the witchy stuff there from the PGM, right?
From the magical papyri, he's got it all.
And he's also got the power of the sun, right?
Who is the granddaughter of the sun?
Who wears the breastband that collects the galene?
Who is she?
The Medwa, the Medea, the Medea.
Or when you look in the mirror and you face Edim.
Yeah, in order to be in paradise,
you got to be facing the mirror.
You got to be facing Edim.
Oh yeah, you begin to see it.
Can you taste it?
Yeah, so yeah, he was dead and alive.
He came back, right?
And put his right hand on him saying, don't be afraid.
Now, looking how Jesus identifies himself here, verse 18,
17.5.
Ego, Amy.
I am.
I'm the first in the PGM accomplishment.
Finish, the finishing.
Love it.
Eschatology.
Carozone and the living.
He is the living.
He's not offering you the Zoe.
It's the Ionian Zoe.
He's offering you and the living.
And I became dead, neck cross, and behold, I am alive.
Eistus ionas ton ionon.
How do you translate that?
It's in the plural.
It says into the ions of ions.
There has never yet been written
a good English translation of that expression.
And if I were to walk into your pastor's office,
if I kicked down his door and walked in
through my Greek text in front of him and said,
listen, you little braggart,
tell me, what does this expression mean?
He wouldn't be able to.
He wouldn't be able to.
No, no.
Yeah, why?
Because they don't read.
They just pretend to.
All right, anybody who tells you they do Greek?
Yeah, okay.
It's rich.
It's deep.
It's deep.
You say it with reverence and fear.
A classical philologist says that with reverence and fear
because they've seen the great, wonderful depths of Greek
and they've swam.
They know, they know and respect its beauty.
And anybody who tells you they know it probably doesn't.
They just have had a couple of semesters.
I left Dallas Theological Seminary.
I went to the president and I was like,
look, I just started my THM program
and I have a bachelor's in classics
with a double major in Greek and Latin.
So your program is weak.
And he was like, yeah, brah.
He didn't say brah.
I mean, may have said brother,
but he was like, yeah, brah.
It is.
He confessed it was weak.
It wasn't what it used to be.
I had looked at some scholars who'd come there
when they were all reading Lewis Berry Shaffer.
And so I knew and it was just weak.
Seminaries are weak.
They are weak.
I went into a seminary
and within a very short period of time, two years,
within a very short period of time,
I had people saying, what are they students doing?
Their Greek is suddenly fantastic.
They didn't even have to know that anymore.
He should have just been teaching them Latin.
What's in the popes?
Decrees?
Anyway, yeah.
Look, he's into the ions of ions.
That's a prepositional phrase there.
Into the ions of ions.
Yeah.
What does it mean?
I'm engaging.
I am that.
Ions of ions.
Phew.
Now, for God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son
that whosoever believeth,
let's get a love of the King James,
on him should not perish,
but have
ion.
Interesting.
Yeah.
You have just uncovered a new reality.
There is no eternal life
that is such an absurdity.
It's a self-contradicting statement, right?
Because the ion is by definition,
especially if you're Pythagorean
and you have a connection to 10,
deck ad.
Does anybody know the deck ad?
No, nobody knows deck ad.
Phew.
Don't eat the cabala on the way there, right?
Cabala's later.
It's medieval.
It's off.
Anyway,
here we have the fruit and we're looking at it.
Here we have the ion.
The ion is outside.
It's outside of the time.
So a definition of eternal for it is sad,
is sad.
And I can talk about other Greek words used for eternal.
I can talk about a simple adverb and it's roots
and the relation to the verb Io,
meaning to comprehend or to perceive.
And Eides, being Hades,
who is the one who was invisible.
The perception of the invisibility,
the phonase, the Saturn, you big doh.
Does everybody see it?
We're right back to Saturn.
The verbs take us there, the language.
The language absorbed all this stuff.
It's like a fingerprint.
The Jews and the Christians worship
a satanic divinity.
That's a profound moment.
Christians worship a satanic
divinity.
That's so lovely, thank you for coming tonight.
We had a couple of questions, but I've had so much fun, and that's a lot to absorb.
And I think what we're going to do this time is just say, hey, all of you who are writing
in with great questions, I'm trying to get to them all.
It may take me some time, and for those of you who have sent me email requests for communications
or zooming, I appreciate it, and I will get through all of those if I have time.
I'm trying, I'm trying.
I love your comments and your questions, and I will return you a response within a couple
of days.
I'll get on the fine time to get on and take you guys extremely serious.
I appreciate everything, and I want you to have a great week.
I'll see you at Satanic Initiation.
Hail Satan.
