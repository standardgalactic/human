I never meant anything I said Just spittin' up everything I've been fittin'
Keepin' from eatin' away at me Never said anything I meant
I never said the letters that I should have said
But so it's askin' too much for me all to believe
But when I say Never meant nobody no harm
When I say Never was the cause for the long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Hello hello and welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
Tonight I'm gonna take us somewhere dirty
I'm gonna take us somewhere where we're gonna get that stuff on our feet
We're gonna follow one of the strongest women in all time
Yeah, we're gonna follow her to a specific point
And she has been maligned and belittled and turned into a servant of a man
And she was not
And we're also gonna talk about Medea
And we're gonna look at a specific incantation she performs
And we're gonna see her actually working the right
So that you can see the functioning of a mystery
Fantastic, that's what we come for to harvest is that goodies
Yes, that's tonight on Lady Babylon
We've got a couple of real nice clips for you
That we're gonna look at that will help to thoroughly brainwash you
Fantastic, love it
Welcome back
Tonight we're gonna go someplace
A lot of people go
But they go with the intention of demeaning
They go as racist
Or people who want to put people in cages
That's how they end up there
How are we getting there in the Bible?
Put the brakes on
Ship's almost there
That's why he talks to them
So that he can distract him from the fact that we're taking a trip
And tonight we're going to Samaria
We're gonna look at Jesus
We're gonna see
We're gonna see Gangsta G
We're gonna see Gangsta G
We're gonna see what he was doing
He was getting away from the heat
Down in Jerusalem
He's traveling up north
In order to get there
He's got to cross over to Samaria
He's got to cross over Samaria
Yeah
So he's been traveling
He comes across a well
And he sits himself down
And this lady walks up
And he orders her
To give him a drink
He doesn't say
Gangsta G doesn't say
Please
Gangsta G doesn't say
Excuse me, madam
Do you have some water?
Gangsta G says
Give me water
Yeah
Now this woman
This woman who was there
What did she pull out?
She says, listen you racist
What are you doing talking to me?
What are you doing talking to me?
Everybody knows
That you
Don't mix with us
Yeah
That you look on us as inferior
Right
Remember this is the woman
Taking the orders
From a culture where women took orders
Yeah
This is where that man is coming from
He's coming from a culture that orders women around
She's not having any of it
She tells him right up front
This is the greatest passage
That nobody has ever bothered to clarify
Nobody has ever played it
Can you smell the air?
Can you feel that dirt?
Yeah
Yeah
Forget the fairy tale
This is not the fairy tale
This is not for those who are wanting to partake
Of the holy hymn
Yeah, hit that
Hit that
This is not for us
This is the place where we look at the details
The reason
The reason
And the first thing she does to him, this woman
The first thing she does
She points out, I'm a woman, brah
I'm a woman, number one
You misogynist
And number two
I'm a Samaritan
It was my family that came here
It was my family
Yeah
So we have a, right away we have this
Kind of conflict going on
Kind of conflict going on
I'm going to show you the Greek in a second
But Jesus pulls out
At that point, what does he do?
He's lounging on their well
Yeah, what does he do?
He's gangster G
You know what he tells her?
You know what he tells her?
He tells her, I'm sorry
My people are a bunch of racists
Would you oblige me?
Do we have some way?
No, he didn't say that
He didn't say that
Jesus didn't say that
Gangsta G said, you know who I am?
You know who I am
You know who I am
Yeah
I want to run a little clip for you
I want to look at Gangsta G
See Jesus Christ for who he was
He was a man arrested in a public park
With a naked boy
When you go to drink of his blood
And eat of his flesh
You are promoting a rapist pedophile
Your institutions are the institutions
Of rapist pedophiles
So he's getting in on it
He's going in on a racial question
He's going to talk about superiority with this lady
You want to know who I am?
You want to know who I am?
What does he do?
He turns right to his meth
As you would expect
As you would expect a
Child prostitution ring leading demagogue
Who gets caught in public parks with naked children
He does exactly what you would expect
He pulls out his drug
He pulls out the thing that keeps everybody going
And you can see it in his drug-addled face
You can see it
He's like, I'll give it to you
You could have asked me
I'll tell you who I am
You want to know who gangster G is?
He says, I'm the guy that can get you the water of life
Water of life
Water of life
That's what I'm going to give you
What do you get with the water of life, Jesus?
Because we're all school children
In the grounds
We're just watching this guy standing outside the playground
Dealing his drugs, right?
Giving this woman a hard time
He says, I'll get you the water of life
Do you know what the water of life is?
The water of life will give you
Ionic vision
It gives you that Ionic life
It opens your eyes
It opens your eyes
It'll send you into the air
It's powerful stuff
And it's got half a DZ accident
And that's why we have little children
All over the New Testament
Little children getting touched
Little children getting scandalized
Little children ending up in tombs
This guy has so many naked children around him
Have you ever wondered who showed up?
Who showed up at his tomb?
Who showed up at his tomb?
Women
Women
Who they call prostitutes
Yeah
Women
He was constantly trying to keep them safe
And they knew Jesus was associated with prostitutes
He's got something going on
If we're in an investigation about why
That naked boy was with him in a public park
We know that he's performing pimp-like protections
For these women
They show up at his death
They show up
And there's a kid there
Inside his tomb
Before this group can even get to him
We know the Bible tells us
He's not associated with prostitutes and accountants
So he's got something going on
Peter's not the only one who's knocking off people for cash
He's not the only one
He knows how this act works
He's not the only one who's immune to the Venoms
These guys have the Venoms on board
This is some major, major stuff
And this Samaritan woman
Who steps up and steps into the breach
She stands against his racism
Because you know why the Jews and the Samaritans fight
Because the Samaritans worship a woman
Isn't that something?
They worship a woman
Nobody saw that with a Samaritan woman
We have Christianized her
We've taken that Samaritan woman
We have Christianized her
You will hear people preaching from the pulpit
You will hear feminists talk about her
And then we have completely
Sturcified her image
Completely
This is a woman who worships a woman
You're not going to tell me to get you water
You've got water in life
Show me
Show me
You think you're the Christos?
Is that what you think?
And there's something lovely that happens in the middle of this conversation
She says to him in the Greek
You think you're that one, the messias?
The one they call Christos
That was the name
The messiah wasn't the name for the dude
Within the right
The Christ was the name for the dude
And the Samaritan points it out
Why?
Because she worships the lady who's the head of everything
Who brings you that burning purple
She brings you that ionic life
You think Jesus came on the scene
And just made the stuff up?
You think just asked me hello?
Do you really believe the fairy tale?
Can we have some fairy tale music please?
Little fairy tale. Chewie hit it
There she is
There she is in the fairy tale
Yeah, with Jesus
Turns out gangster G comes up and brings his brand
Up to them
He brings it up
He's like I'll get you water life
You'd be sitting in a, you'd be sitting in a tomb for three days
Totally gone
Yeah, yeah
We'll bring you out of it
And what you bring back with you
Will open your eyes
Will open your eyes
Jesus Christ
Was a child selling drug peddling cult leader
A performer of a mystery
The source of which goes all the way back to the Bronze Age
Yeah
But here he is doing his own function, man
He's out there flying on his own juice, right?
Right? Fantastic
Let's, Chewie hit that clip number two
Hit that clip number two
What happens?
What happens to this process
If we let it keep working its mold?
To me to hear that
Because I heard that for eight years after the revolution
You know, same stuff that Russian, Russia
And basically Russian propaganda that was translated in Russia
Is the same thing people who are anti-Ukraine repeat in other countries
Including America and you know, pretty much everyone
I would say
So this whole thing about LGBT
Which by the way, nothing wrong in supporting LGBT
But yeah, but it's not something that justifies an invasion
But they just use I would say in Russia LGBT as a boogeyman basically
So for them it's an example of like a western degeneracy
I apologize if it sounds rude
But that's how they call it
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
I'm the guy who can come into town
I've got minions
These minions will write laws about you
Yeah, gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
That woman at the well stood up against him
Face toe to toe
Toe to toe
She wasn't afraid of him
Just like Anastasia is not afraid of gangsta P
Yeah, look at what they're trying to do
You say, hey, this is political
I haven't said a single political thing
Not a single
This is not politics
This is history at present
Pull yourself out
And look at what's going on
Don't join a club
Just look at what's going on
Yeah, it's coming
Gangsta P is coming
I want to shift now
And I want to move to a little bit of incantation
To bring me to a place
Let's everybody get back in the ship
I'll take a drink of tea
We'll set the time now for late Bronze Age
Put the settings, Chewie
On some cult
And let's look at what she's doing
Let's look at what Medea herself is doing
Who's spirit are we sucking up along the way?
Because we're necromancers
Who's spirit? We're going to grab Seneca
We're going to grab the guy that was advising Nero
The guy who had the access to the collection
Yeah
Turns out the emperors were keeping collections
Of scrolls
With ancient knowledge on them
Yeah, a lot of pharmacological stuff too
A lot of cult
Nero comes in
And gives us a ritual performance
Yeah, Seneca
Peers into this ritual performance
Nero supplies the drugs
Through his Arch Mage
His Arch Yathros
His head doctor
His head doctor
Who has got access to the formula
We've been here
I showed you the documents
You've seen this stuff
You guys know where we are
We need to go into that dark harbor
In order to do that
We're going to pull out Seneca
I just want to read you a little bit of Seneca
I just want you to relax and enjoy
I'm going to put my glasses on
We're going to see cult for the first time
It might get a little dark
It might get a little bit PG-13 rated
But we're going to take a look
This is Medea
She says, I loosen my hair from its bands
After the manner of my people
With bare feet
I trod the secret groves
And called forth rain from dry clouds
Get a picture of her
And who she is
Get a picture
We need to look at Sitha
That Sithi and Queen
We need to take a look at her
Surrounded by her Medusa
Fantastic
I have driven the seas back
To their lowest depths
And the ocean is tide's outdone
Shrushing waves further into the land
This is the woman who stands
This is the woman who stands
And in like manner with Heaven's law confounded
The world has seen both sun and stars together
And you, you bears
Have bathed in the forbidden sea
The order of the seasons I have changed
The summer land has blossomed
Beneath my magic song
And by my compelling series
Has seen harvest and wintertime
Fossus, the river
Has turned his swift waters backwards
To their source
One of the rivers of the four
That surrounded Edim
Edim
And mere magic, Edim
Is the Medwa
Yeah, fantastic
Those four rivers ran out everywhere
Those of you who think about the garden
You should be
Yeah, wonderful
Excellent
The waves have roared
The mad sea swelled
Though the winds were still
The heart of the ancient woods
Has lost its shadows
When the bright day has come back to them
A commandment of my voice
Yeah
Focus imperio me idea reducto
It's a beautiful line in Latin
Yeah
By the command of my voice
By my voice's imperium
The day is led back
Do you see how unnatural this is?
Right? It is that female voice
Standing
It's the order against it
Yes, it's gorgeous
Gorgeous, love it, love it, love it
Phoebus has halted in mid-heaven
That's the sun, right?
Phoebus has halted in mid-heaven
The Hyades moved by my incantation
Taunted to their fall
The hour is at hand, oh Phoebe
For your sacred rites
This is Medea
Who is speaking to Phoebe
Who is in two senses
The Britomart
Yeah, she is that
Artemisian or that
Dianic force
Yes, yes
She is also
The Lucifera
The Lucifera
Yeah, the bringer of that light
The bringer of dawn
We see in this invocation
We also talk about the attributes
That are given to Aphrodite
And people say
We're invoking Hecate here
We very much are
But when you look at the epithets
That are used for Hecate
When you look at the images
Orphic hymns that are used for Hecate
And then you cross those
Phucis, Urania
It called her
They are the same
And the culmination is in the line
Medusa
She is the one who guards
The air
The water
And the earth
She is that one who guards
All of those realms
All of those angles of existence
We're talking about the quantum
And the fact that you can't observe something
Without changing it
Yeah, the fact that you can't
Observe something without changing it
Yeah
Yeah, let's continue
Let's get into the
Into the riot
Let's see what she's actually doing
To you I offer these wreaths
Wrought with bloody hands
Earth each entwined
With nine serpent coils
What does she offer?
What does Medea have to offer?
What does this woman at the well have to offer?
Serpent coiled wreaths
Yeah, serpent coiled wreaths
Serpent coiled wreaths
Gorgeous
To you
These serpent limbs
Which rebellious tiffius wore
Who caused Joe's throne to tremble
Are we still in Samaria?
Yep, we are
We're still there
We're with a woman
Whose people caused the throne
Of Joe's
Jehovah's seat
To tremble
Yeah, this is lovely
It gets real druggy here, watch
Watch this
In this is the blood
Which Nessus, that traitor
Ferryman, bestowed
As he expired
With these ashes
The pyre sank down
Which drank in the poisoned blood
Of Hercules
Nessus' blood is poisoned
Hercules' blood is poisoned
There's a reason she's the medusa
She's six foot six
Looks like a twelve year old
Before she was born
They were bathing her through her mother
In the venom
You know what happens
When you do that
You get the medusa
People are surprised
That was a thirteen year old girl
I found, Sylvia
Looks like she's the head of an army
Yeah
Yeah, you're right
You're right
These feathers, the harpy left
When she fled from the ETs
And to these
The quills of the wounded symphalian bird
Which felt the darts of Lerna
We're talking about bows
And drugs
You have given forth
Your voice, you altars
Wait a minute
What's happening
She is hearing
The voice from the altar
Why are we doing this?
Don't worry, Moses has that
Tent in the wilderness
Where you can sit there
You can take in all those drugs
That are coming off of that altar
You can face the snake
The serpent on the
On the rod
And you can have the voice of God
Speak from the oracle
Guess what Medea is doing
Is this odd? Should we find this odd?
No, Pendar says
That she preserved the oracle
Right, there's an oracle of Medea
Right?
And who is she speaking to?
She's speaking to the first oracle
Phoebe
Isn't that gorgeous?
That's gorgeous
Yeah, I see
Trivious with gliding car
Not as one radiant with full face
She drives to live long night
But as one ghastly with more full aspect
Harried by the salient threats
She skirts the nearer reign
Of edge of heaven
So do you
Shed from your torch a gloomy
Light through the air
Terrify the peoples
With nude red
And let precious Corinthian bronze
Resound Dictina
To your aid
She's invoking Critomartis
Right?
She's invoking the Poison Shutter
Eok Ira
Eok Ira is what the Greeks call her
Yeah
To you
On your altar's bloody turf
We perform your solemn rites
To you a torch caught up
From the midst of a funeral pyre
Has illumined the night
To you
Here's the right
Tossing my head
And with bended neck
I have uttered my magic words
For you
Lying in funeral
Passage
A band
Binds my flowing locks
For you is brandished
The gloomy branch
From the Stygian stream
Now for those of you with ears to hear
And for those of you who are just
Super into
People like Virgil
You'll understand
You'll see the images and you'll know
The miraculous cult
Kuma
Why?
Because that's where we go into the underworld
This is the quantum part
We have to open up that
Underworld
You didn't think Jesus was arrested
In a public park with a naked boy
You didn't think the woman at the well
Was a hero
Standing up against a gangster
But now you do
Now you're seeing it
We've got to go into the abyss itself
We've got to find that place
What does she say?
What does Medea say?
Gifts staying to my poisons
A day when they ain't a steam loss
Give that power
To move
To my drugs
Give that power
And in my gifts
Keep hitting the seeds of fire
The seeds of fire
Are in your poison
What does she start to do?
She starts to cut herself
She starts to cut herself
And remember these medusa
They carry the poison in their hair
They have it constantly there
The arrow poisons
In this passage Nero points out
It's all about the bow
Says Medea
Arcus
Arcus
Bow
It's all grounded in that poison
In that communion
And Medea even says
After she's
Around the time that she's identified
Is Lucifer
She talks about
Her sacred latte case
Her sacred latte case
What is latex?
What is that?
A milky white juice
That comes off the opium poppy
When you cut it
Now it doesn't have to be just
Opium
Can be any juice
Any juice
Excretion
That transfers
From
The source
To the participant
The Ionic life
The eye opening
Medea says
Her blood
Is that life
Is that life
She
Is the Christ
She is the savior
More than a thousand years
Before Jesus ever existed
Jesus
Ganks to G
Knows what he's doing
He comes back
After they told him
The magi told him
This dude's going to be the king of everything
He goes down to Egypt
He gets his education
He's got his drugs with him
He's got a ton of frankincense and myrrh
He's got the very elements
That you mix everything else in
Jesus
Was using drugs so
Heavily
His
Education of the mystery was constant
Unceasing
We're going to look
Over the next couple of weeks
What happens when you're under the influence
Of
This communion
We're going to talk about that thirst
We're going to look into the cult
We're going to see Jesus
By the way, he got popped in the end
He got popped, someone turned on him
He got handed over
For justice
We're having a debate with Neil
About Jesus getting handed over
Paul says
He got handed over
That's used
For giving somebody to the authority
So that they can find justice
Bring to justice
Jesus got brought to justice
He got brought to justice
In the end
He's yelling, remember the same guy
The same cocky gangster
Who's standing there
Who's standing there with this
Woman
Of Samaria
Who is the gall
To stand in his face when he's a man
Right
Says, you know who I am
That same guy who's saying
I've got the juice that you will never
Thirst again
That same guy screaming out
From across
I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty
Ah
And he's screaming magical phrases
Yeah
Sabakthon
Sabakthon
You know who appreciates Sabakthon
Those Samaritans that are looking for the Christos
Which the Jews call
Messias
You see how it works? You've been looking in the wrong
You thought you were looking in the entrance
You're looking in the exit
Right, we've got to get back there
We've got to get back to those times
So over the next
That's our 30 minutes
That's all the devil gives me
But over the next
Couple of Bible studies
I want to go to these places
So that you can see
The cult and operation
You can see this person
Who enters that
Phase
Who enters the Eremon
Who enters
That place where the heavens are open
Where Uranos
Is able to transmit
And I want you to see what that brings
I want you to see it
I want you to realize those seven stars
That Jesus holds in his hand
Those seven stars
Are the same
Seven stars that Medea uses
To form the cup
The cup of the sacred communion
Yeah
Jesus Christ
Was high
High
On venoms
High on venoms
Yeah, somebody just wrote to me and said
I get this
A lot
Where people say, you said that
And I didn't believe you
But now I saw something
And now you were right
And I'm amazed that you're right
And I'm some sort of
You know
Constant plotter
Of dark deception
Right, no, so
Scorpion turns out
Scorpion venom is the most expensive
Solution on the planet
Right, turns out
Pound for pound
It's the most expensive
And why is that
Well, I don't know
I can tell you in antiquity
They were using it
Yeah, using it in these weird
Weird stuff they were doing
But it was medical too
Yeah, they weren't just smoking these things
Like they do in Pakistan, right
They were in antiquity
They were integrating it with the medicine
Yeah, you got to get that body
Remember the polypharmacy
Shout out to the
Gentlemen
Pharmacologists
Neuro pharmacologists
Who contacted me
Shout out to you
Yeah
Because you know the art
You know what's going on
Yeah, imagine that
The next level of pharmacology
Making the patient
The
Manufacturer of the drug
You can give people things
To make them
Produce the drug
That you need to
To reach that
Ionic
Persistence
They say it makes you live a long time
They said she looked like she was 12 years old
It didn't make sense, Medea, right
Why is she looking like she's 12 years old
And she leads the army
Why is she the only one who can stand up
Against the other guys
Who have the bow poisons
Why is she the only one that can stand up against them
Why is she the master of the purple
It's because she's producing it
She is producing the communion
Her bodily
Substance
Is our communion
This is
1100 years before that
Gangsta G ever showed up in Samaria
To give them
To give them a hard time
Yeah, thank you for coming tonight
Thank you for coming tonight
I hope the microphone is
Helping with the audio
And
I'm going to have a meeting
With some people after
I need a few minutes to take a break
But for the next couple
Of sessions that we have
I'll be
Pushing
We're going to increase the speed here
We're halfway through
We're approaching the midpoint
So we need to speed
We need to pick up our pace there
So that you can feel your productivity
Is kicking in
Yeah, thank you for staying with us tonight
Thank you for being here
Hail Satan
