Tables at the door.
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
Okay, welcome back to Satanic Initiation on Lady Babylon
Tonight there are going to be two groups of you
Those who can make it all the way through the end
Without severe nausea
And those who won't affect it all
But that will be a few, that will be a minority
You say how can you set things up by bringing in something like
Because you know where we're going
We were last time in the temple
In Jerusalem with Jesus
Bringing us new territory
Now we're going to stay with Jesus only this time
Instead of going with him
We're going to bring him up
We're going to bring him up along with Moses
And the party
Tonight we're going into an actual Bacchic Rebel
And I want you, I know that you feel like you can make it all the way through
But you'll regret it at some point
I can promise
Tonight on Lady Babylon
We have to pull out our most holy incense tonight
To be able to purify this place
I mean, bring it, breaks the time
We're going to cleanse out this place
So that we can call in these texts
And I'm going to show you some
Just straight up literal Bacchic ritual
And we're going to be looking at drugs
We're going to be looking at states of mind
And we're going to be looking at catharsis
Yeah
What we need to cleanse this place
Is a little bit of Artemis
We need that daimon
Called Eohiara
Eohiara
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
Something happened
It was Aura
You know what she had the guts to do?
She had the guts to put down Artemis
For the shape of her body
Yeah, she did
And this is what happened to her
Go ahead, Chewie
What we need to cleanse this place
Is a little bit of Eohiara
Eohiara
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
I have seen the place
Where the woman is made of bride
She has made that bride next to the rock.
Yes, next to the rock.
Now you thank to yourself.
What does that have to do with?
What does that have to do?
Just wait, just wait.
There's a wedding we need to go to.
Ready?
Everybody, the ship's here.
Everybody get out.
I want you to look right now.
I want you to look into the eyes of a boccan
and what's going on with a boccan.
It's hit me with the first one, Chewie.
Fantastic, blow it up.
Yeah, yeah, nobody.
You know what's going on during the celebration?
Nobody in the city was acoric.
You say acoric, what does that mean?
Nobody didn't dance.
Nobody didn't dance.
That's what happens.
That's what happens with the stuff, guys.
As soon as we get there,
we're not gonna be sitting in pews.
We're gonna be dancing.
Dancing, fantastic.
And Bochus is gonna go visit somebody.
He's gonna go visit Icarus.
Okay, cool, let's hang with him.
Come on, Bochus, we got Jesus.
We got Jesus right with us.
Here he is, let's go.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
This is what Bochus is distributing.
Uh-huh.
A pain-killing intoxication.
A pain-killing intoxication.
If, I want you to look at these words.
Lucie pon oil means to destroy that anguish,
to take away that pain.
And it is used for a specific class of drugs.
It's the name of a class of drugs in antiquity.
The pain killers.
Let's go on.
The pain killers.
So, okay, everybody get the, okay, we're good to go.
Okay, I just want you to notice the name
in the very middle of the second line.
Ganymede.
Bochus tells this guy, he says, look,
we're watching him talk right now.
I'm sorry, what's that?
Bochus, what'd you say?
He said, look, I'm going to make you equal.
Ganymede, ganymede, ganymede.
You're going to be heading up the rights.
You know what people brought up until this point?
You're going to bring them my communion, my communion.
You're going to bring them the blood.
Do you understand my son?
It's the son of God we're talking about.
Don't you get that wrong either?
We come here to worship Bochus at this time in history.
We come here to honor the son of God.
The reason that we have all of the problems
is because people will not embrace
that he is the son of God.
Yes, prove it, Bochus, prove it.
Okay, I'm starting to, can you feel it?
Can you feel the, at least the pain killers?
They give you that right at the door, right?
Let's keep going to the next one.
Why ganymede, yeah, why ganymede?
Go to the next one.
Why ganymede?
Because ganymede gives something to Zeus.
Actually take it down, Chewie,
and get us whatever mind-bending pictures you've got.
Because ganymede is going to take us to Zeus.
Well, who is ganymede?
Oh, isn't that nice?
There he is.
You thought I was just making up stories.
No, look, here they are.
Fantastic.
Ganymede, what does he do?
He bears the cup for Zeus.
He bears the cup.
What does that mean?
Well, that's on two levels, people, okay?
And we know it, because you and I,
did you see that Roman Hitchhiker we picked up
a few weeks ago, who's been on Time Spaceship?
Yeah, he's influencing us subconsciously.
Yeah, and what he's doing is he's telling us,
look, we know what the ganymede is.
The ganymede's the cup.
If you are following the Pripyek poems,
which are old Roman poems,
hymns and whatnot, little ditties, epigrams,
all sorts of stuff, man.
Pripyek, and what do they say in the Pripyek?
Ganymede has the anal cup.
Yes.
Zeus drinks from Ganymede and Hebe.
Hebe, did you just say Hebe?
I did.
Do we have a picture?
Fantastic.
Hebe, notice, notice.
She looks like she may be young.
It's because youth, youth is what her name means.
Okay, remember, we worship the gods.
We're not like Christians and Jews.
We do not become honest and worship one force
at the expense of all the others.
We worship youth in antiquity.
Hey, who doesn't want to be young?
Who doesn't want to be young?
Do you know the Son of God?
Who's the Son of God, Mary?
You guys don't know it.
You don't know who the Son of God marries.
It's Hebe.
It's youth.
And what does Hebe do?
Youth gives ambrosia to the Olympians.
She's the source of Olympian ambrosia.
What is ambrosia?
What are ambrosia and nectar?
Right, because Ganymede's tromping around with the nectar.
He's got that nectar.
And youth, she's got the ambrosia.
And what is she doing?
If she doesn't give us that,
we don't live forever.
You mean that's what the Greeks thought?
Yes, let me say this to you,
and I want you to use everything practiced
up until this point, mentally, mentally.
If you don't feed the gods,
ambrosia and nectar, they die.
They become immortal.
Their mortality is burned off by their own ikor.
And what is ikor?
That is what flows in your veins.
That's what Medea removed from Telos.
Yeah, yeah.
And if you don't have it from Hebe and Ganymede,
you don't have your mortality burned off.
Yeah, did you think that the, yeah, right?
It's a system has to work according to the laws of physics.
Right, okay, I get it.
Let's get very rational stuff, people.
It's not, you know, come on.
You didn't, who's here to get Bacchic?
I came, let's stop the lesson and just get back to Bacchus.
Let's go.
Look at this people, what's he gonna give you?
He's gonna give you, look at the two words underlined.
Do you see oinu and in?
That's the word for wine and genus, oinus, right?
Oh, look at that.
And it's adjectives.
Way the heck over there.
On the other side, way over here, right here.
Eger si no oio.
And that's a fight for your great people, my students.
That's archaic, right?
That's an old genitive.
Anywho, look, they don't have to be right next to each other.
I got no problem with that.
What is this thing full of, right?
It's full of this wine that is resurrection wine.
You say what?
Resurrection wine.
Have you ever heard of resurrection wine?
Interesting.
It's gonna egero you.
What does that mean?
You remember the little kid?
It was under the influence and the tomb.
Screaming out, Jesus goes into.
Rise up.
Egero.
Egero.
Egero.
That's all you need, people.
That's all you need is that resurrection wine.
Okay, the Son of God brings us that, right?
Thank you.
Thank you, nice.
Let's go to the next one.
What else do we get in this package, right?
Well, it has, if you're gonna be involved in this,
you're gonna be involved in the oistress up front.
And everybody here knows what the gadfly does.
The gadfly stings you and makes you mad.
He makes you crazy.
He makes you want to pursue.
Kicks your mind into a place of mania
that is unsatisfiable, insatiable.
Oh, God.
She's giving it to him.
Who is daughter instead of the milk?
That's what it says under it.
Let's go.
Let's go.
And what happens?
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
Speak up.
Speak up, old man.
Where'd you find the nectar of Olympus on earth?
Where'd you find it?
Where'd you get it?
You didn't get it from the cathesis.
This xanthochron, hudor, look at that, xanthochron.
What does that mean?
It means the color of xanthos, xanthos.
What is this stuff?
You thought, what is this stuff?
I'm going to assume it's wine.
This isn't the origin of wine making.
This is the origin of Bacchus.
Take a look at the next, next we're going to give a,
I think it's this one.
Is that, yep, xanthos people.
Now we have a problem.
Take it down.
We have a problem and then put it right back up
when I say we have a problem with colors and antiquity.
You would think in Greek that there would be a red and a blue,
maybe a green and a yellow.
Everything's going to be fine.
Yeah, well you discover there's a huge problem
when you start studying medicine
because every color fluid that comes out of the body
must be described.
These are all symptoms.
Yeah, was he phlegmatic?
What was it like?
Right, was he bilious?
Right, so you have to know these colors
and they're weird and they can vary.
And every time you have one, you got to think,
I bet this could be a couple other colors.
So here's our option people of the color.
Yellow, various shades with the tinge of red,
brown or auburn.
Perhaps all the way to a brown through an auburn.
Golden people, xanthos is golden.
It's like yellow with a touch of blood
with just a touch of blood.
But look, we know certain people are known
for their nice blonde hair.
Their nice blonde hair.
And there's even a wine here in this list.
Look at paragraph number two.
We got an aphrodisiac wine.
There's that golden, golden.
You want some golden stuff?
You know what Kelly's hair was colored?
It was golden.
You know what Medea's hair was colored?
It was color of radiating sun.
Nice, nice.
That's the color we've got here.
And that's the color of the hudor,
the solution that Bacchus has given people.
And let's see what it does.
Okay, so first we already got the painkillers at the door.
Right, now what are we doing?
Right now we're getting ready.
We're hearing about, people are dancing, singing,
and now we're gonna get the golden.
We're gonna get the golden.
You ready for the golden?
Watch what it does to you.
Watch what the golden does to you.
Don't tell me, right?
Don't, no regrets on this trip.
People all wanted to be here.
So no regrets for what we're about to see.
I think it was this one, Chewie.
Yeah, I just wanted to blow that up.
Look up, there it is.
Getting the golden water.
Okay, here we go.
Bring me up the next one.
Go ahead, yep.
Nope, that's not that one.
I wanna show them that when I work it out.
Look, in a fragment.
I just want you to see.
Before that, we got there.
I was about to drink it, right?
I was about to drink it.
But look, we gotta realize who's around us at the party.
Who's around us?
A crowd, an awful loss.
Just like Jesus.
You mean Jesus's kiddies followed us here?
Yes!
Jesus's children followed us to a barricade.
You can do that.
You know why?
The devil's in control.
You can summon his ghost.
You can grab that resurrected guy right out of the sky.
Bring him here right now.
Why'd you thank the two or three thing?
Two, three of you, I'll be right there with you.
You will.
There's a hundred of us.
Let's go to, look, we brought him with us, people.
What does this say?
Says this is all happening with a crowd of local nymphs.
Local nymphs, yeah, local nymphs and children.
Children, right?
Children.
Local nymphs and the children.
Do you remember the doves?
Oh wow, what is a nymph?
What is a nymph?
What is a dove?
What is a dove?
Where are the kids?
We're in a barricade.
Does anybody feel just a little uncomfortable?
No, you don't.
And do you know why you don't feel uncomfortable?
Because we have given you one drug at the entry
and now you're getting another one.
This is the main thing.
You'll need an antidote for it.
But just wait, just wait, watch what happens.
Let's see.
And I know some of you have written to me and have been,
by the way, if I haven't gone back to you,
I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.
I will catch up.
But for any of you who have been,
people have written to me and said that they know
of these festivals, right?
What's the difference between the mystery
and just a good, solid rave?
Because watch what happens at the mystery.
It doesn't happen, it's rave.
Okay, here we go.
Oh my God.
This thing, did you get some?
Let's have some together.
That's right, let's have some, final season.
Let's have some together, have some together.
Oh, that golden stuff, that golden stuff.
That's what they're doing and what happens?
This golden stuff, I'm just gonna translate.
This isn't the potion that Lady Athena created for us.
This isn't that.
This thing is sweeter than any milk that you can get, man.
Right, it stays fresh all the time.
Do you hear me?
I just, did I just have the potion?
Yeah, and this is what I'm saying.
This stuff is crazy good.
Wow, fresh, bro.
That's what happens, fresh.
Now, look what happens.
It's also, look at the last word in the third line,
coqueo nos, coqueo nos.
Does anybody recognize the coquean?
Yes, you remember how many times I've told you
coquean is an ingredient that is used.
It's a compound, but it is an ingredient
that is used along with other.
It's mixed with other things, right?
This thing that you're getting on board,
this is the top.
This is the heart of elusis being channeled
right through a god, right into a nectar.
And we're gonna get served that nectar.
Let's go to the next one.
I love this, I love this.
Are you guys ready?
Watch what happens, watch what it does to people.
Look, you must have taken this stuff from,
didn't you take this stuff from Hebe?
She must have been the one to give it to you.
And Ganymede, he said previously, right?
So you must have stolen this stuff, right?
Who took the mixing bowl of the gods, right?
Wow, this is where you are mentally.
Next one, next one.
Tell me, speak.
All right, speak.
Something's gonna come from your stoma.
What's gonna come from your mouth?
What's gonna, we're under the influence
of this sweet potion.
Notice here in the first line, it's not a wine,
it's a potion, it's a drink that's been concocted.
And what happens?
I become Hedumanes.
Look at that, I've got problems in my brain, right?
I'm in mania.
Don't you feel like you're in mania?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but this is meant, right?
We gotta have the music, we gotta be dancing.
Remember, we're dancing, because people dance
when they're under this influence.
It's half the death metal.
That's why the devil dances.
Sisters of repression and dissatisfaction.
You know you want it.
The people are even commenting that you want it.
Does that satisfy you?
The repression is too much.
The communion allows the Bakant, my class,
to enter into the place where the repression is loosed.
Isn't that nice?
You wanna see the Villa of the Mysteries sometime.
We should all take a field trip to the Villa of the Mysteries.
Yes, right, we should all go transported.
Transported through time and space.
Let's go to the next reference source.
Yeah, oh, where are we?
Look at this, just look at the thing that's underlined.
That's all you gotta know.
Where's my mind going under the influence of the gold?
It's going to Lyssa.
To Lyssa, who was Luce, madness, mania, right?
And it's theiatic mania.
This is specifically Bakic mania.
This is the glorification of the mother.
The virgin who made it with Zeus
to produce the Son of God, to produce the Son of God.
She birthed within the lightning.
Are you ready to see the lightning?
Do you have the oistress on?
Because it's sad, this is giving us the oistress.
It's sad, it's giving us that sting.
Are you ready?
I don't know what Paul said, this stuff was so good.
All right, go to the next one, please.
Yeah, oh, look at this one.
Look at this one, just, ow.
Okay, I got to fill in the blank
for what happened between here.
You can leave it up to you if you want, it's your call.
You have good judgment.
Thanks for all the navigation
and none of this will be possible.
What happens?
So when you're in that oistress,
when you're in that state, something strange happens.
The music and the dancing will focus the group of maniacs
into one machine.
And they will turn on a carious and they will kill him.
Together, they will understand why his death is necessary
and they will kill him in their mania.
And there's a very graphic description of them doing this.
And now here's where you start feeling regretful, right?
They kill him, they pound him with their fists,
they bludgeon him, yeah.
And then they start with a cudgel and aerating him.
It's got a spike on it, a thorn,
and they start aerating him.
And the blood is splashing around.
And this verse says that that blood,
it combined with that dew,
purpleizing the wine, purpleizing it, making it purple.
The blood is absolutely necessary.
You cannot have the mystery without a sacrifice.
Do you wanna see the sacrifice continue?
It's gonna get graphic, that was nothing, okay?
Don't feel bad for the dude, right?
He's the one who was given the gift.
Yeah, he's the one who was given the gift.
This is a God.
This is a God not to be, not to be toyed with, right?
You can't make a deal with the devil and then renege.
You can't, she's just done work.
All right, let's see what Bacchus does.
Are you ready?
I know, a lot of you are like,
oh, I'm not sure I wanna go here, right?
We're going, yeah, sit, love it.
Let's go there to the next one.
Yeah, yeah, they're screaming crazy stuff too.
Crazy stuff too, no, go to the next one.
Oh, this is what I want.
Yeah, that's fine.
I want you to notice that all of this spiraling down,
this mania is a controlled psychosis
that is driven by eros.
This says eros is a prophet,
the one who is the fire.
Okay, unless you are in this state,
you'll never make it to that vision and prophecy.
If you think Isaiah and Ezekiel walked around
with a little notepad and did a little,
no, no, no, they didn't,
those guys were warped out of their minds.
I was standing there on Mount so-and-so
underneath a blank tree and all of a sudden,
the Lord God smacked my nogget
and I ended up in the wilderness.
Right, and the angel standing there,
what did I do?
I bent over and I was urinating on the ground,
you know, in my pants,
because I was so scared and shaking and oh, right?
There's only one way to get there.
This is what the gold is for.
This is what the gold is for.
It allows us to find that place.
That place we can come back from,
yeah, and have a new birth.
Yeah, love it.
Let's go to the next one.
This is poetry people and I want you to notice here.
Remember Carl Rock?
Here's a little tribute to Carl Rock.
I mean, he's still, you know,
I mean, it's nice to tribute like, you know,
gotta email him too, but I'll do it here.
Look,
what is a thuepolos?
It's somebody who leads the thue or thuo,
who leads that sacrifice
that is the burning of the incense.
This is Mr. Fumigator.
He works for Hera and he is Entheos,
my tribute to Dr. Rock coined the word Entheogen, right?
Well, here's Entheos, right there, right?
That priest who is the one officiating that right
who is bringing you to the place
that you need to be brought,
that priest is Entheotic.
They have a connection that you don't understand, right?
Now you can obtain that connection through the mystery
and the Christians would say, this is your demonia.
Exactly, right?
Exactly.
So do you see the drugs are there,
the ritual is there, everything about the mystery.
By the time Jesus gets there, remember, this is hot.
This is hot 300 years before Jesus.
This is hot 250 years before Jesus
when people are writing for the first time
the Septuagint in Greek and it becomes a hit.
Yeah, yeah.
This is that stuff that's there.
Remember, it's from this environment.
That's why Moses is gonna show up.
You thought Moses was gonna show up?
Oh, we gotta keep going.
Where are the babies?
Can somebody get me the babies?
It never works unless you have a giant sacrifice.
Do you see your sacrifice?
Let's go, let's look at the child sacrifice, shall we?
Oh, no, no, let's not.
You can't look anywhere today
that you don't see the child sacrifice.
So appropriately, here it is, here it is.
Let's go to the next one.
Yep.
Yeah, okay, so here, I'm just gonna translate.
Look, I'm really small,
but I'm just gonna try to blow it up to you.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Oh, it's hurting me.
Okay, look, what happens?
Dionysus is pissed off.
Yeah, what does he do?
He drives all the Anarchy and women.
Oystress mad.
Look at the second line, oistresa.
He oystressizes them, yeah.
And what do they start doing?
They start a la lazoing.
What do you do when you a la lazo?
It's a war cry.
It's also a shout of joy,
and it's particular to the Bacchic Mysteries.
It is our word, take it down, for hallelujah.
For hallelujah, just take it down for a minute.
Hallelujah.
When you wanna express hallelujah,
you're expressing an old Greek idea.
An old Greek idea that was there centuries
before there was ever any Hebrew.
Okay, our understanding of these documents
has been completely tainted
by religious schools, both Jewish and Christian.
Both of these groups, this Jewish religion
and this Christian religion,
both of these monotheistic religions
developed from the Bacchic ritual.
I'm not the one to first start saying that.
They said that in antiquity
when they were watching what they did.
Yeah, fantastic.
Okay, let's go to the next source.
What are those people doing?
That looks illegal.
Go to the next one.
Okay, no, I mean, go to the old one.
Okay, yeah, there we are.
Okay, now what happened?
He drives them mad.
He's pissed off, right?
Bacchus is mad.
Because they, why?
Because they won't accept his worship.
So he makes them accept his worship.
You see, that's not a very nice thing for the son of God.
This son of God,
isn't like the son of God that you're used to, right?
This son of God has something to prove.
And he does so.
Watch this, what does he do?
The women, he makes it so they go out on the highways
and they find people and hurt them.
And these poor women, they take,
I'm just gonna translate it for you.
They ready their cutting implements for their newborns.
They ready cutting implements for their newborns.
And they take the sword, what is this, what happens?
A mother will kill her kid right there.
Yeah, another one will take her kid
who is only three years old and totally destroy him.
And another one, some other one,
will take their little kid and throw him up in the air.
Just heave him, heave him under the influence,
under the influence.
They won't have any thoughts.
You know where their minds are?
It says their minds are in a place.
They won't have any thoughts for breastfeeding, right?
They won't have any thoughts for that.
They won't remember the childbirth.
They won't remember they'll just sacrifice.
So a mother killed her son, yeah,
doesn't even think about the breast,
has no memory of giving that kid birth.
You know what happens in the place called a sterion?
It says this, you know what happens?
Their young people give a sacrifice
of the locks of their hair.
You know what sacrifice they're given now?
They're given the children's sacrifice.
Yeah, I'll tell you what I'm doing.
Uh-oh, all the air went out of the room, right?
Can you feel it?
It's kind of chilly, right?
You thought you wanted to come to this.
I told you, I'll bring it to you.
I'll show you what it is.
I'll show you, and now you're sad.
Don't worry, there's a bottom and there's a top.
We'll come back, we'll come back here.
Let's start to come back.
We've gotten to the bottom.
Okay, are you ready?
Shift into, oh, bring in Jesus.
Where's Jesus?
Come here, Jesus, Revelation, Revelation 21.
And I saw a new Uranos and a new Gaia
for the first Uranos and the first Gaia.
It perished, it went away.
And the sea is not, yeah, yeah.
And what else did he see?
He saw holy Jerusalem.
I'm telling you what I'm seeing, baby.
I see that new Jerusalem coming down,
coming down from Uranos and from Theos.
I see it coming, yeah.
And what's gonna happen?
It's gonna be like a nymph.
It's gonna be like a nymph.
Wait, take it down.
A nymph, did we just see them?
We saw them, right, with the kids.
You saw them, Chewy.
Did you see the nymphs that were here?
I told you, right?
We're gonna see a nymph.
Wait a minute, is this the Bible talking about Jesus,
the Son of God performing the mystery?
Correct, it is.
It is.
It's him doing it.
And he's got the nymph.
Have you ever wondered, let me just ask you Christians,
Catholic, Protestant, doesn't matter.
I'll even ask the Mormons.
Maybe the Mormons go for this stuff.
Did you hold his witnesses?
I don't care.
All you guys, all you guys know that when Jesus comes back,
when the Son of God returns,
he's gonna make you his bride.
He's gonna, no, it's okay, Chewy.
It's okay, yeah, he's gonna make you his bride.
You know you're the bride of Christ.
Are you ready to see bride of Christ?
What you're in for?
Yeah, this new Jerusalem.
This new Jerusalem.
What's it gonna be like?
Did you know the foundations of the foundations of Rome?
Do you know what the Templars found?
They found the foundation of Rome
and the city of the seven hills.
That's what they found, Jerusalem.
Let's go to the next pass.
Yeah, the same one here.
Here it is, Revelation.
Well, I heard a voice.
Oh God, they're hearing voices again.
Right?
Are you guys hearing voices?
I mean, the stuff they gave us.
And I heard the voice, a great one.
And it's coming from a throne.
Okay, I think I took something else, people.
Look, there's a tent of God with men
and he's tentifying with men and somebody out there.
I know, I can feel you.
I can feel you, Mason, a free Mason.
I know you're out there.
I know you're out there and you want that skein
to be something dirty.
Free Masons are dirty, right?
What's that skein A to be something, right?
Look for the gland.
Right?
This is what's going to happen.
We're gonna skeinify.
Are you ready to go back to the passage?
Oh God, it's so lovely.
And a lot of people, you know, God himself, right?
He'll be there and a lot of people.
It's gonna be a big crowd, right?
And he's gonna wipe away all your tears, baby.
No tears.
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you,
underneath the influence of the gold,
nobody's gonna care.
If you and I can execute our children or newborns
right in front of everybody and nobody cares, right?
They're gonna eat them anyway, right?
They're gonna have that almost a year, right?
Ooh, gonna have a kind of a watered down barbecue
without the barbecue.
Without the fire.
You ever eat raw meat?
Hey, you wanted a Bacchic revel, right?
You wanted it.
Let's go back to that one, yeah.
And what is he gonna do?
All of this is gonna happen because in that third
to last line,
and there will be no death.
Take it away.
There will be no death.
Do you know why?
Didn't we show you last time, Jesus,
going through the cathartic rituals?
Didn't we show you his magic that he's doing?
Yeah, this is the extension of that.
This is the performance of the mystery.
You go back to that verse one more time.
The same one.
I just want you to notice, people,
death will not exist.
Death will not exist.
Remember what we said?
Those of the second death.
What do we do?
What do we do?
In those days, we are gonna be stuck
because we're going to be searching for death,
but death is not gonna come, right?
Why?
Because the mystery will have been restarted.
The mystery is that salvation from death.
You didn't think Jesus and the resurrections were all
just symbolic, right?
Right?
Yeah, realize the physics is there, right?
You evangelicals may be able to pull out enough.
Common sense to respect what I'm saying.
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go to the next one.
Look what's gonna happen.
There will be no death.
I just want you guys to see it, right?
Why?
Because we've restarted the mystery.
And what does the mystery do?
The mystery avert death.
How does the mystery do that?
By submerging you in that transit.
Right?
Right into that black hole.
Love it.
It's gonna open your eyes, right?
Jehovah was trying to do that from the start.
What do you think Eve was for?
You gotta have the water of life
if you wanna take Adam, your boy,
to the place where he goes beyond and comes back
and has the knowledge.
Has the knowledge.
It's like a God.
It's like a God.
You know how you burn off somebody's mortality?
I wish we would start.
I wish we would start.
Let's go to the next one.
Love it.
Okay.
Hey, for the rest of you.
For the rest of you.
Just give in to that fear of Christ.
Right?
Now, wait a minute.
I didn't say anything about fear.
I forgot to mention people.
The drugs that they've been giving us,
you know, that makes us kill our children.
Those drugs make us exceptionally fearful.
Fearful.
What do we fear?
We fear the Christ.
This language that you find in the New Testament
is not separate and distinct
from the environment of the classical world.
Jesus did not suddenly appear within a vacuum.
Yeah.
He is using the machinery that is there at the time.
Has anybody noticed that we've been doing Greek
the whole time, that everything Jesus says is in Greek?
Because they were not speaking Hebrew.
Yeah.
It was liturgical.
And it pissed people off, but too bad.
Languages die.
Right?
Deal with it.
Greek kicked, but across the world.
Wasn't just Hebrew.
Gee, how many languages did the Roman world wipe out?
Right?
Oh, thanks, Evander.
Evander gave him the alphabet, you know,
through his mom, Kermintah.
Love it.
You know, she was a prophet, right?
You know, she was a Bacchic prophet.
Is that surprise anyone?
Yeah.
Love it.
Did you know your history has been generated
by people you are unfamiliar with?
Yeah.
Yeah, it has.
Very good.
Very good.
It's only the dogs that get recognized, right?
Given to your fear of Christ, right?
Become that fear of pan.
Keep going.
Yeah.
And the women.
Women, by the way, this is just a little bit.
I'm just, I'm taking Paul and I'm just causing him
to cough up something.
We're talking about marriage and whatnot and cult.
And you know, what?
If you are within the movement, what is your opinion?
Right?
You gotta obey your men, you know,
as if they were the Curios.
Do you hear me, Eve?
Do you hear me out there?
Why is this associate?
Do you hear me?
Eve didn't listen.
That's what started the whole problem.
They had just written this thing in the third century.
So these New Testament writers, they're fresh on it, right?
It's hand in glove.
It's good stuff.
And you have to understand that that Curios,
that Christos is that Adam.
And I'm not the one saying this.
They're the ones saying this.
Is the Adam.
You mean Judaism and Christianity
are just two aspects of one single cult?
Yes.
And that cult came earlier
and gave birth to Judaism and Christianity
at a time when women were also worshiped.
Love it, love it.
You're never gonna be able to hide those women.
Keep going.
Yeah, next quote, please.
This is Ephesians and Paul says in the men,
love your wives, you know, is Christ.
Is he agape the ecclesia, the church, right?
Okay, all right, all right, good, good.
Gave himself, you know, gave himself,
put his all and might into it.
You know what I mean for the church?
Because this is his bride.
Come on, man, we defend him.
We defend the bride.
That's the way it is.
Do you think this mystery didn't defend the bride?
Look, and what is all this for?
It is for catharsis.
It is for a cathartic cleansing.
Wait, what, am I back in the Bacchic, right?
Yeah, you are.
This is Christianity, but it's Bacchic.
And what is all this for?
What does Ephesians say?
Right, why does Jesus do all of this?
In order that he may purify her, right?
He may make her holy with a purification.
It's a bath.
It's a bath of water.
And how do we get there?
We get there in remati, rema, rema, that's what we'll teach you.
That's what we'll teach you in the initiation
when we get there.
And we are ready to bring you there and back.
That's what we'll use, the rema.
This is what we see in the papyri,
the Greek magical papyri.
This is what we see.
The use of this rema, this saying,
it's not really the same.
It's this power that radiates,
that you use via the logos,
which was in the beginning.
All right?
You see?
You have to channel the right, channel the right forces.
Or you're not gonna be commanding demons.
It gets my goat when people try to command demons
without understanding the physics
because the physics is image.
And if you don't have the right image,
it's gonna be useless.
I don't know why.
I mean, it's like, if you don't have wings,
you're not gonna fly, bro.
It's that simple.
Let's go back to the source.
Okay, good.
And so this is that cleansing that we need.
We are in cathartic rites with Jesus.
And Bacchus.
Go back.
Yep.
Fantastic.
Yeah.
Why is he, what's he gonna do?
Ultimately, he's gonna make his bride a thing of honor.
Right?
Not having any spelone or rutida.
Wait, she's gotta, she's gotta,
she's got no spelone and no rutida.
Did Eve have this stuff?
Did Eve have this?
No, she didn't, right?
Because Jesus and Jehovah don't pick anything
but perfect virgins, right?
Are you, come on, people, watch.
Look what happens.
But she is a momos, Eve is a momos at the bottom.
She is not without blame.
A momos.
The church has to be made without blame.
Why does Eve have the blame?
Cause she went through it and had her eyes opened
and saw that God was nobody.
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?
It brought her, you thank the guard of Eden
the expulsion of Eve and her forced hard labor
in childbirth because he took away all her drugs.
You really thank that Eve went down
and got on her knees and honored this Creighton
who threw her out.
Sorry, apologies to the people of Creighton.
It's Menander.
And back to Medea.
She's the one who said Creighton's are all liars, right?
Sorry, it's a modern Creighton.
Lovely place, gorgeous place.
Anywho, this is what we have to.
This is what we have to deal with.
Eve's reputation.
She didn't lose it.
She gained it.
What did God, Jove or Jehovah?
What did that father God know?
He knew that if she got access to this fruit
from her own tree that she would be like him.
She wouldn't need him, right?
When you get there, take it down from what I was saying,
when you get there and you realize that you don't need him,
you know why he puts a guardian there, right?
He puts a guardian.
Who kept that way?
The light bringer kept that way.
Mr. Reason himself kept that way.
He allowed her.
He allowed her to contravene the orders
of the mongrel God who was with the boy Adam.
Now, when I say Theos there, hear from antiquity.
Hear from the Bronze Age.
Theos, hear it, right?
Hmm, can you see him?
I can see him.
People say don't make an image of Allah or God, right?
Don't make an image.
I got one right here, right here.
And it's not complimentary.
Why?
Because we're children of Eve.
Yeah, let's be children of Eve.
I love that.
That was beautiful.
Those romantics were nuts.
Let's go.
Have more and that's it because we are way,
again, way over time.
What is that speed loss?
That's just the, I just wanted you to see
that it's some kind of naughtiness, right?
Flack or blemish.
It's just some kind of mark or blemish.
And what, let's go back to Paul.
What is it?
What is it?
Christ did want, he loved you
and gave himself for you, for us, right?
As a offering, something brought forward
and thusia as that burnt sacrifice.
And what does that burnt sacrifice do?
It's a beautiful smell.
It is Eodias.
Wait, it is Eodian?
Did I tell you?
Did you guys see on the pot when we came in
and they had that stuff that causes the pain killing?
The initial drug that we all took to get into the mystery.
Did anybody notice that written on that pot
was the very same?
Was something, go back to that, Chewie.
Was something very same?
What was written on that pot?
What was written on that pot?
Eodia.
That which is most pleasing to the smell.
To the smell.
A eodic drug.
Compounds are eodic.
And what does notice tell us?
The compound that Dionysus gives us,
he tells us it is eodic.
Eodic.
You didn't know Jesus was carrying around
the same thing, did you?
Yeah, remember?
Remember what he got so pissed about in the temple?
You can't bring that scale of sin, right?
This is my thing, right?
Let's go, let's go back up.
Yep, just to the next source.
Yeah, keep talking, Paul, keep talking.
Nope, next one.
Yep.
Okay, and you gotta know this stuff, man,
that every, what does Paul say?
He says every pornos.
Every pornos.
Every acathartos, right?
Every pleonectes.
Yeah.
Wait, what kind of people are you talking about?
Everyone who's a porne or a pornos.
Remember a pornos can be a 12-year-old boy, right?
It's somebody who is being used within the trafficking,
right, the sex trade.
And what else?
Unclean, acatharsia, or anybody who has that acatharsis,
right, who's acathartos, right?
Everyone who is that.
What are they?
They are idolaters.
They are idolaters.
If you go through one of these purifications,
you're gonna end up performing idolatry.
And if you look up porneia, you'll find that it is
not only temple worship, but at the very same time,
it is temple sex, it is acts that cause you
to enter into a sexual state, right?
Even if they're using virgin priestesses
who are not de-virginified
to retain their irracular power, okay?
So there's still sexual acts going on in these rites.
All right, all right.
Now, I promised you Moses would show up.
Where's that guy?
Come on, Moses, bring me those.
Keep going.
This is the next one, just do the next one.
Yeah, here's some translations.
You know, no immoral, impure, or greedy.
Okay, keep going, go down.
Who is sexually immoral or impure, covetous, right?
Okay, keep going.
Nor unclean person, nor covetous man, right?
Who happens to be an idolatry?
That's a terrible translation.
King James sucks sometimes.
Keep going.
New American standard, which tends to be the most literal.
Impure person, no immoral or impure.
Okay, see how even they're kind of brushing aside
what that actual purity is talking about, right?
We're talking about Ganymede.
There's a reason that Zeus drinks from his rectum.
Don't get upset at me.
It's in the Pripyat.
Some British knight wrote a whole treatise
on all of these aspects.
There's sodomy and what it was within the ritual,
dildos, there's all sorts of things
that have to do with sexual gratification and ritual.
Because this is all under the umbrella of Lord Pripus, right?
Now you didn't think, would you be surprised
if Jesus is standing in the place of Pripus?
Oh, now I understand the boys.
Now I understand the boys that are with Jesus.
It's a necessary occupational vehicle,
the boys that they're using, right?
Okay, good.
Let's go to the next one.
Not good for them, you know, the jigs up with these people.
But I just want you to see a little bit of fragment here.
This is just a little bit of Silene speaking.
We're going to the cave of Hermes.
We're going to his nurse, Kuleene.
And she says, mainuna piste, don't be in disbelief, right?
Trust what that goddess gives you.
Yeah, and the chorus sings back
and how, right?
How can we believe that this dead thing gave out a voice?
This corpse, dead, how do we know that they thunder?
Are you ready, people?
We're a debauched rave, right?
Are you ready for the dead to give their voice?
Because that's what we are.
You are not who you were.
You're dead.
Silene says, believe it, right?
For being dead, right?
That dead person has a voice.
But when they are alive, they're just a voiceless beast.
Okay, that was a little bit extra
for the people who like to solve the puzzles, okay?
I want you to.
That was a little extra picture
of what's going on within the rite.
Give me the next one.
And finally, 1st Corinthians 10.
Did he find me again here?
How you doing, Moe?
How you doing, Moe?
No, you came dressed inappropriately.
Take off, Moses, take off your clothes, Moses.
Right, let's show you the rites.
Are you ready?
Blow this up, Chewie.
I'm just gonna translate this, people.
Yeah, I don't want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers,
that our fathers, all of them,
they were underneath the influence of the cloud.
Yeah, and all of them came through the sea,
through the midst of the sea.
Yeah, and all of them what?
All of them were baptized into Moses.
Take it down.
Baptized into Moses.
And the Orthodox Jews in the group say,
well, we don't care.
That's your New Testament garbage.
We don't care about that, right?
It's fine, you can put up that wall,
but you should know you rabbis and scholars of the Torah.
You should know that people in the first century
who were reading your Septuagint are saying,
Moses is a Baptist.
Moses is a Baptist.
You mean, wait a minute,
you mean all that funny snake stuff that Moses was doing
and the snake on the stick and all the healing?
Yeah, it's all Baptist.
You were baptized into Moses.
Now, originally, what this concept was
is you are submerged in the muse, moussa.
But what it became was you were baptized into Moses.
It's no different people, right?
Every religious Jew on the planet owes a debt of gratitude
to the Greeks who established their irracular cult.
Moses would be nowhere without them.
And maybe some priests,
maybe some Egyptian priests throw them in there, right?
Alexandrians, yeah, love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Isn't it nice to discover where you're from, right?
And you can see that Christianity and Judaism
are just variations of this very cult
that we are talking about
that we're trying to get straight up, right?
Look at.
Now, what is, I wanted you guys to see this definition.
I should have used it earlier,
but this is what happens, it's okay.
This is what happens when the Bakken enters into the state
that they can end up doing a thing
that has the root pi, right?
Pi, paidos, meaning child, paizo, right?
What am I gonna do?
When I am under the influence of the cult
and I am in my psychosis
and I am seeing my two sons
and I am sacrificing the children,
what kind of mental place do I get to?
I get to a place that I want to dance.
Dance, it is a place that I want to play.
Just look at the definitions.
It's a place that I want to play on a musical instrument,
which they do for some reason.
The music guides this group of maniacs, right?
And women are the ones who pioneered this.
It's only late that men get involved, right?
And that's part of why you have
John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, right?
Cool, so look what else does it mean?
Number five, play amorously, what?
You mean they use a word for playing amorously
that uses the root for child?
Yeah, sportive, to be sportive, like a child, frolicsome.
It's like a, do you ever see a little deer
jumping about, little young one,
jumping about, right, around mommy?
Yeah, that sportive, I'm not used to using that word,
it's not really used anymore,
but that kind of frolicsome behavior
is what the Balkans are known for.
So take it down, I just want to give you the big picture
within this right that we have just come to.
We are now in a state, we started out drinking
some painkillers, I haven't felt a bit of pain.
We entered into taking that gold,
it's filling our veins, it's burning off our mortality,
and what do we do?
We offer up our children, right?
We offer up our children.
And what happens after that with all of this?
Well, Jehovah gets mad, bring us back to Corinthians.
Watch what happens, people, watch what happens,
you know that they were baptized into Moses,
you know that they were, yeah, and all of them,
what did they do?
They ate, wait a minute, they ate what?
They ate a pneumatic broma,
and that word broma, just leave it up to me,
that word broma can be food, something that is secreted.
Wait, what?
Yeah, it can be or dur, it can be poopy poops,
it can be something that goes through your intestines,
this is how it's used in the Gospel of Mark.
It's not what goes into you that corrupts you,
because watch what happens, that stuff just goes
through your bowels and ends up getting extruded.
It ends up getting extruded is broma.
It ends up, wait, what?
You mean your body can process something into broma?
Yes, and that is what they are eating.
They are eating pneumatic broma, what is pneumatic broma?
I don't know, I don't know, I'm gonna pass on that one,
I'll stop with the goal.
The pneumatic broma, let's just leave it that,
but it does something to you.
Did you remember that manna?
Did you know that they were all on drugs?
Manna is a drug, it's a Greek drug and a Greek name.
It is not Aramaic, it is not Hebrew.
Hebrew did not exist when manna existed, yeah.
But you know what manna does, yeah you do, yeah you do.
Manna sustains us, manna is what they gave
to Mary, the virgin mother of Jesus Christ
when she was in the temple,
being nourished by angels, manna is what they gave her.
Okay, here we go, let's go back to Corinthians.
It's so creepy, isn't it?
It's like we're all of a sudden in some kind
of cultic group or something.
And what happens, so they ate this stuff
and then epinangar ek pneumaticis acutusis pedras.
Wait a minute, what?
The poma is a potion.
They have created a potion, a poma, and they're drinking,
this is Moses, the people of Israel, right?
Who at the time were not really calling people of Israel,
but this migrant group, right?
In the desert, what do they do?
They're drinking potions, they're eating broma,
and what else, there's a rock, there's a rock with them.
Wait a minute, you mean the bride
has to be around that rock?
Yes, that's the Greek that I showed you.
That rock goes with the process of the mystery.
Are the Jews performing the mystery?
Yes, are the Christians performing the mystery?
Some of them, right?
Fantastic, the rock is there, one more time, one more time.
Oh, let's just go.
Okay, yeah, and somehow they ended up getting extruded
into the wilderness, but anyhow, things go bad
and God gets mad and people die.
And these things are there for examples for you people.
See, you might know not to have these tendencies
to be able to go into this process of using these drugs
and becoming born again.
You're gonna have to stop doing this, right?
There has to be a real skein here.
There has to be a limiting tent where we can go,
a limiting tent where we can all go, right?
There's gotta be a place, hence Jesus in the temple.
He's reestablishing, he's taking over the Bacchic tradition.
One more time with that verse,
I just wanna see if there's anything there at the bottom.
Yeah, so there's a lot of pornating.
I just want you to see at the bottom,
there's a lot of pornating, right?
And a lot of people get killed for the pornation.
Now you can follow the fairy tale
and you can say something like the ground
opened up and swallowed them.
You can say there was a fairy of death that came down
and caused everybody, I like that one.
I like the fairy of death.
Yeah, it's fun.
I don't read that to my children at night.
It's bedtime story.
The angel of death.
What a terrible job.
Okay, but what happens?
What happens?
These people are pornating, right?
And that's what's the wrecking the problem.
That's why thousands of them are killed.
How many thousands?
A lot of thousands, several thousand, right?
Okay, take it out of here.
Moses is presented by the author of this pistol,
if it's Paul or whoever, who cares?
I don't care if it was the actual junkie.
I know they trust this one,
but if it was the actual junkie Paul or not,
Paul knows the thorn and the flesh.
He knows this.
So he knows that when Moses goes out
and he's with his people and he's getting ready
to build that skeine so that he can have that one right
so that he can control the oracle.
Because if everybody's doing it,
gives us no power.
Why do you think people in the loses kept it secret?
Why do you think their priesthood kept it secret?
Because people went every year to a loses
to be able to have this life-changing experience, right?
It was keeping the territory.
They were guarding the territory.
And Bacchus says in this text, he says,
hey, this isn't that cup that Athena gave you.
This isn't that.
This is the gold of Bacchus, right?
You're about to go there.
This is the right that Christianity emerges from,
makes changes to and then perpetuates
with its own bastardization of the right.
Now, the early church fathers messed up
and had them remove the drugs from the right.
And as Christianity came to power in Rome
and as they found their Trump and Constantine,
they found access to that power.
They then regulated all of the experience
that you would get from the use of a drug,
i.e. idolatry they regulate.
Haven't you ever wondered why modern evangelicalism
and Nancy Reagan go hand in hand?
Haven't you ever wondered why people just say no
and why it's a good religious person doesn't do drugs?
Haven't you ever wondered that?
That is the mechanism of a people
who lived in the third and fourth centuries
trying to get you to have your access cut off.
So much so that now we don't even have
the concept of the drug community.
We don't even have the concept of it anymore.
We're having to rediscover it.
We're having to rediscover it.
Yeah, I want you to be happy tonight
knowing that all of the religions that are around you,
that you're hearing, that you're feeling,
the ones that are propelling you forward,
those religions have an anchor in history.
This is where we're from, people.
We're from this right.
It was this mystery that forged Western civilization.
It was this mystery that creeped across the Atlantic
on some ships and ended up with you and I
celebrating Thanksgiving.
A holiday that Thomas Jefferson said
should never have been a holiday.
Never should the government have supported
a holiday that was a religious holiday.
Why?
Because everybody knows from history
as soon as they take over,
as soon as you have a man, woman, or child
in a Christian office, you will lose your democracy.
You will lose the voice of the people.
You will lose the golden age
that you've managed to bring to the world.
And if you doubt me, the last thousand years will show it.
Have you seen the sacrifice?
Have you seen the children's sacrifice?
They want to make a personal appeal
because on the breasts of a lot of people out there
are let's save the children.
While all of us watch the thousands.
How many is it up to now?
5,000?
6,000?
Imagine 5,000 children slaughtered
on the altar of greed.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Justify yourself.
Justify yourself.
Take that to the watchers.
Try sometimes, sitting with a watcher
and try speaking up as if there's something good
about the human race.
Try it.
Thanks for coming tonight.
I will see you next Wednesday
for what is the downhill end
of Lady Babylon Satanic Initiation.
Thank you for coming, Hail Satan.
He never cared for his payment for June
