Blasphemy
I'm flying for peace, all things hidden will be revealed
I'm Freddy Kruger with the purple stone, Hail Satan!
My deus is home, I'm in the twilight zoning
Roots I cut and grow em'
Diff up all you token, take two hits and hold it
The witch she keep you loaded, so good they want my mow it
I spit dragon venom through hell and through the heavens
High fire is purple, I'm with the ashy ashen
Where the horses ride, flying through the night
I'm here for the promises, you feel alright
It's a policy, she keeps it tight
Got the costume on, all night
I'm with the fumigation company
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
All of us who have lost companions on this route
Yeah, tonight we're going to be talking about Hackety
We're going to be talking about Hackety and her hound
Her wolf, her black gorgeous beautiful wolf
A shout out to all those who mourn
Given that, what do I want to do tonight?
I'm going to give you a warning before we start
Because this is the most radioactive blasphemy in existence
This is stuff that will burn through the quantum reality
Are you ready?
Nobody has ever, ever, ever translated this
Nobody has ever translated this
And you are getting it exclusively
Exclusively, tonight you've got to take it
To see something that nobody
Nobody has seen
Now, what is it we're going to see?
It is the deepest, most radioactive blasphemy
Oh my god, I can't wait
Oh god, you know, this is fresh
This is fresh off the muse
And I am telling you, we're going to bring up a ghost tonight
Where's that whip?
We're going to bring up a ghost tonight
We're going to work that ghost out
And we are going to look at something
That is going to make you all sick to the stomach
Oh, Christing
You wanted to see what Christing was
Let's look at what Christing is
Here we come
Where is he? Come here, Galen
Come here, get over here
You love it, you love it
Come here, this is, show us, show us
Blast them, blast everybody
Blow them off the page, go
Look at people, look at what I'm talking about tonight
I'm talking 1826
This thing is out, it's published in 1826
When John Quincy Adams was president of the United States
Oh, what a year
This is volume 12 of all the works of Galen
Nobody has touched this thing
This is right in the middle of the pristine well of life
That is the collected works of Galen
It's right in the middle of it
It's just hiding there
And what this is, I'm going to show you
Let's pull it out, Galen, tell me, Galen
What you want to talk about tonight
Look at this people
This is his work on the simple drugs
Their balances and their capacities
Okay, we're talking about simple drugs
Right, I told you
I'm going to show you the Christ
Like you've never seen it
And this has never been opened before today
Give it to me, this is fresh
This is fresh stuff
Oh, God, I'm going to just go through
Look, people, I'm going to translate it
But I'm going to warn you again
This is rough
Are you ready?
So, what does Galen say?
Chewie, can we readjust here?
We readjust the console here to get us going
Okay, look people, he says
I've been talking about some things that they do
With some bodily fluids, yeah
But these things aren't really forbidden
They don't really have a pollution value
Right, but now what I'm going to talk about
Because I talked about that before
Now what I'm going to talk about is plenty that
Are you ready?
This is Galen, he says, hey
This drink of sweat and the drink of urine
And the drink of the woman's menstrual flow
These things are esselge
And loathsome
Give me a hope, right?
That's what the word means
I'm just translating the word for it
Makes you loathsome
The drinking of it
Wait a minute
Galen, are you talking?
Are you talking about?
Okay, let's let him go on
People don't interrupt Galen, right?
And what's he say?
The worst one of all of these is the copros
What's the copros?
That is translated as feces
The feces which they Christ themselves with
Around the mouth and down the throat
Xenocrity says it gets in the stomach
And it causes certain problems
Christing, we're going to look at it
I'm going to show it to you in just a minute
And it results in the copros
The poopy getting around your mouth
And down into your throat
Remember, he's just been telling us
About body fluids
He's going to go on and on and on
About blood and about bile
He's talking now about poop
And Christing yourself with poop
How do you get Christed with poop?
You didn't know that Christ had something to do
With the application of feces to your mouth
And throat, did you?
How do you think they got it there?
Are you ready?
I'm told you tonight, people
I told you tonight
All the gloves are off
This is dedicated to my companion
And she was such fierce German shepherd
She wouldn't stop for anything
To do what was right
I know it's extremely, extremely uncomfortable
To look at the actual evidence that we have
When you get in that ship and you go back in time
And you're sitting there
Watching them do these things
It's difficult
Please, those of you who have not
Been part of the congregation for long
Realize your nausea medicine will kick in shortly
Fantastic, fantastic
Let's go for it
I'm going to keep translating it
Go back, I've got to keep translating it
Okay, Galen, give me some more, buddy
Give me some more, Galen
Oh, I love this, are you ready?
So he says, look, you know, I can't
Xenocrates wrote about it, you know what I mean
And he wrote about what it does
He even wrote about drinking earwax
Drinking earwax
Right, I told you these people are into a lot of things
Now, did you know they drank earwax?
It's a medicine, people
What else did he write about?
He said, Galen said, I don't know
He said, I don't know, man
If I'm going to recommend it
Right, because, you know, for any kind of disease
But, you know, there's very much one, I think
That's the worst of all of them
These body fluid medicines that they're using
And that's the poop
Galen, he's got something against poop, right?
And he says, look, it's the greatest
It's the greatest hardship or trouble-causer
For people who understand, for people who know
Right, we know about the coprophagia
We know about eating poop
We know about the ischla-urgon
We know about doing the sexual acts
That we're not going to talk about
And being the canitis
We know about the canitis
We know what the canitis does
The canitis, remember in Greek, is the one
Who presents his buttocks in a dance
Okay, Galen is saying, we know
Everything that's going on, right?
But this thing is rather bad, you know what I mean?
But, despite that, there's one even worse
It's those people
Who are doing the lesbian thing
While they are doing the Phoenician thing
Wait, let me get this straight
And this is right here, I'll just read it
Two spoiny kids on taston, lesbian, zonton
Right, those people
The worst thing is, the medically, the worst thing is
Is the people who are doing the Phoenician
From the group that does the lesbian thing
Yeah, we'll take a look at some of these words
Okay, Galen, thank you very much
And what happens, he says, look, there appears to me even
Some advantage for the one who drinks menstrual fluid
Right?
Okay, then he goes into a little discussion
Of trying it and stuff like that
Look, the very last two lines in the bottom
They say, but look, there's one
There's one that is just friggin' gross
And that's when people do what
When they Christ parts of their body
With poop
Galen, what kind of parties are you hanging out at?
Well, that's not as bad, right?
I can understand even the eating of the semen
Says Galen, the male seed
I can understand that
It's the one where we Christ with poop
That really bothers me
Wait, I'm going to finish up here
With the cannon, the nuclear weapon
Are you ready? It's about to detonate
Hit the next one, yeah
Okay, people, hold on, right?
So this other guy's anocrates
He's writing about these things, right?
He's differentiating very carefully
Between the penis that is Christed
And its advantages between that one
Because that's what you're going to get
On your mouth and on your throat
He's distinguishing between that one
And the one that you have in intercourse
Between male and female
When the penis slips out from the colpus
What is it covered with?
Right?
So this is all Christing
If you'll just look, we'll look at the Christing terms
Look at the third line down
Catachryomonos, right?
What is he talking about that's being Christed?
He's talking about somebody's private part
Which they gonos, right?
Let's just say that, you're gonos
Look, I'm teaching you, great
You're gonos has been Christed
And the stuff that's on there
Is going to end up on your stomach
And in your pharls
So here's the advantages and disadvantages
And here's the antidotes to clear that stuff up
Give me the next one
Because it's different, right?
It's different
Last one here, go hit it
There it is, blow it up
Here we go, all right, Galen, give me one more
Just give me one more goodie, right?
Give me one more goodie
Look, he says, Galen, you know
Urine that you drink has a certain power
You know what I mean?
And, yeah
And you can drink it
And you can be Christed with it, right?
You can Christ it all over the parts of your mouth
You can use poop too
Okay, are you ready?
Are you ready?
So when Jesus Christ is around
The word Christ means something
And I am showing you what it means
Give me the next one, give me the next one
Oh, yes, no
Oh, it's so heavy
It's so heavy tonight, these taxes are heavy
People, just hold on with me
Oh, Lord Jesus Christ, please
Please hang around with us for as long as you can
As long as we can stomach
Hit us with the next one, that's all I can take
Get him off there
Okay, look what we're talking about people
Poesis de hidrotos
A drink of your sweat
The sweat is also the stuff that's all over your body
Right?
When you take a sweat bath, you know what I mean?
You get all that and you're like, what is this stuff?
You can bottle that stuff, right?
We're talking about the effects of it
And he's like, this is what you use it for
Hit me the next one
What else?
We're talking about the drink of uru
Your urine
Okay, I just want you to know
They're drinking urine, the same people who were
Putting poop on their bodies
Come on, grow up
Anthropologically people, come on
Look at what they're doing, they're using the urine
Give me the next one
What else?
What else?
The catameniu of the gunaykos
Right?
The monthly running
The monthly running and I'll show you what they thought
The monthly running was
Remember, this is a world that respects science
Who else in the world do you think has such an art
Dedicated to physiology at the time?
Nobody?
Why?
Because you need language
Your history is not you
It's your language developing
You're just a friggin ant
Yeah, love it, love it
Give me the next one
What else are we talking about?
This says the one who drinks the menses
This is a specific person
A menses drinker
A menses drinker
Now remember, that's not necessarily a bad thing
Physiologically
Right?
Okay, let's see what the next one is
According to Galen, you be quiet
Give me the next one
What is that?
What is that catamenion?
Look at these people
It's your monthly wages
You earned it
Catharsis
It's what?
It's your catharsis
And then they put hyma
It's the blood
Look at number two
What is it that we're drinking?
Look at number two at the bottom
The menses of women
Right?
It's just from the concept of the monthly thing
The monthly activity
The moon's influence
Love it, 28 days
You gotta love that
The science is so
It's like a bunch of nerds
Got together, made democracy
Give me the next one
What is that catharsis then
That women undergo?
It's a purification
It's a clarification
Look at number two
Medically, what is it?
It's the clearing off of morbid humors
An evacuation, whether natural
Or by the use of drugs
And are they using drugs?
To regulate their menstruation?
Yes, it turns out
You're supposed to
Isn't that funny?
Isn't that funny?
There's a whole world of plant and animal products
Out there that will tune you up
Yeah, maximize your greatness
Ooh, I love that
Turn you into a vampire man
Nobody will stop you
Nobody will stop you
We gotta read those texts too
Up and down, the flow
Dialing in and out
That's why they're going out at midnight
They all get naked and oiled up
And they go out at midnight
Just like those boys
Who are being initiated by the Christian church
In the catechesis
Performance of the catechesis
That's, they end up
Naked, stripped, and oiled
The priest oiled them
And they tell the children, do not be afraid
Christ himself was naked on the cross
Yes
Okay
Did they understand?
Did the church understand what Jesus was doing?
You better believe it
Or Origen wouldn't have had to cut off his testicles
Did you know that?
There's a Christian hero who cut off his own testicles
When everybody else was getting arrested
For, oh, I can't say that word on YouTube
For doing things, children
Yeah, check it out, early church history
It's pretty disgusting
Let's keep going, let's keep going
Oh, I can feel Safi, this feels good, I like this
What else are we talking about?
You gotta realize we're talking about something
That's Beloura, right?
So Galen is talking in terms of those things
That are impure, those things that are unpurged
Those things that are abominable, right?
That cause the reaction to step back, right?
Okay, fantastic, give me the next one
Give me the next one, why is this all important?
Because do you remember
In this tiny, tiny, tiny message to you
Do you remember the musterion, the mystery?
It's all about Babylon, the great
She's the mother of those prostitutes
And of their bedelug maton
The earth's pollution
The thing that we're talking about
That is what is in her cup
Okay, if you just fell to profound connection
To the nature that is these plants and animal substances
And the moon cycle
If you just felt that, that is what
Christianity, Judaism, Islam
It's what they close, it's an oculus
That they close off
So that you don't have a connection with her
And who's the she that I'm talking about?
I'm talking about Hecate
I'm talking about she who makes magic
I love it, I love it, absolutely love it
Let's go back, we gotta go back into the Christ thing
Just a little bit more, I just want to keep showing you
Because people, you know how it is
What's gonna happen?
Lady Babylon, look at the second line
She has a cup that's gold
And in this cup, whether she holds in her hand
Is the bedelug maton
Caeta acacarta
Teis porneas
It is the pollution
That which is unclean, which is in her cup
It's the uncleanness of her pornea
That pornea is a sexual activity
The cup that gives you ionic life
Is her pornea
You mean Jesus in the mouth and throat
You mean all of that?
I could have done the other one
Who told us to come here?
Ryan, who told us?
I told you people, never go to a monist
Paradise, never go to a religious monist
Anything, I don't care if it's an ice cream social
Shame on you, congregation
Satan, that's one for you
That's one for you, everybody
I hope you felt that
Let's get back in line
Get back in shape here
She's got that cup, right?
What's happening now?
Okay, I'm sorry to spring this on
You say, Tenant congregation, I'm sorry to spring this on
I should have told you I was going to do this beforehand
But I brought you something tonight
I did, I brought a gift
It's the fulfillment of prophecy
It's the completion
You are the ones now who are being written about
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
The people who inhabit the earth will be amazed
They'll be amazed when they see the beast
The one that was and is not, but will be
This theriac is not currently in use
People ask me all the time, do you think it's being used?
I know it's not
I have slogged through the miles and miles of wilderness
To get to this point where Christ is putting poop on people
Nobody has been here, I can tell you that
This muse is a virgin spring
Oh God, and tonight you are seeing her
And what happens when the people of the world see that beast?
Bring it back, tell us what happens when they see it
Oh, give it to us, Chewie
I want them to get it literally
They see it for what it was when it used to function
What it is now that it does not exist
And what it will be when it begins again
We are at that point in history
And you are the people of the earth
I love this, I love this
It's gorgeous, give me the next one
Look people, now I brought you some poop
Because that's another thing we have to figure
We have to factor into all this
I know, I know it's gross
But if you talk about Christ and you talk about poop
Why?
Why do you think?
How do you think you get it on your mouth and down your throat?
Don't you think it's funny?
The Galen who is the physician is talking about people
Who have gotten poop plus stuff off of bodies in their throats
Drugs, we are drug users, right?
All these people are friggin' drug users
It's natural, man
So what do you do with the poop?
Give me the next one, Chewie
We are going to the poop planet
You become one of these
You become a coprofagon
You become a poop eater
When you are with the lace-dace Jesus Christ
You become a coprofagon
You have to, right?
You could put swallow here instead of eat
And it would be just as accurate
You're a poop swallower
Do you understand?
You are not Christed if you're not
Makes you wonder
Give me the next one
How do we stay on Disney?
We die a Christ someone
We die a Christ
Look, people, I'm bringing you a new species
This isn't even catalogued in the Liddell Scott
The Alice, right?
The Oxford masterful lexicon of ancient Greek
This isn't there
You're going to spend a long time finding it
There's no definition for this
This is a new species
That's how Greek is
There are so many words
Look, they think they're 1.7 million
Here, here's 1.7 million and one
Right? Oh, God
What does this mean?
It means to die a Christ someone
Look what you get to benefit from
Satanic congregation
Nobody, no monist out there
No Jew, no Christian, no Muslim
Has ever heard of this word
Ever, ever
You get it
People of the earth, you get it
To die a Christ someone
What do you die a Christ them with?
Oh, give me the next one
This is the person who's getting
Die a Christed
It's a canitis
It's a canitis
You know what the canitis is?
It's a little dance
It's a little dance you do
It causes your bottom to flop around
Causes your bottom to flop around
That's a canitis
That's a canitis
And he's the one getting Christed
Everybody wondered about Jesus
And the sexuality
Give me the next one
Cata, here's another one
Here's the second
I didn't bring you one
Oh, this one's for me
You're so good
I love that
Self-mastigation is what I am showing you
Now, I just made up a word
Because I know the Greek roots, right?
He's auto-masticatory
What?
I suppose
Only on Sunday
In the bed of the muse
Cata, here's the
What is this one?
Here's the new species
To Cata, here's something
That's an intensifier, that Cata
That means to really spread the poop good
Anybody getting a little bit
Right?
You mean suppose you got to be there
You had to be there
Right for all this Christian stuff
Hit me the next one
Let's go
Look what's happening, people
Now, for those of you who don't believe me
I know there's going to be someone out there
Even though I put this up
For that dude
Hey, guy
You were sitting out there
I know you're thanking this
You're going to be like
I'm going to write him an email
And I'm going to ask him
Where's your source?
You're looking at it
You're looking at it
Are you ready?
We're talking about people
Who are really, really, really
Christing parts of their mouth
With poop
How do you get like totally
Poop mouth and antiquity
How do you get poop mouth?
Dude's got poop mouth
You know what I mean?
I'm sorry
Don't be scientific about this
I don't have 18 shirts like this
No
How do you deal with somebody
Who's poop mouth, right?
Who's been Christed?
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that guy over there?
He's all, you know
He's Christed on his mouth
This is application, people
You're applying
You're using that applicator
The alabasteran
Whether it's human
Whether it's flesh or not
Eat my flesh
Right, sorry
That was Jesus
Eat my flesh
And drink my blood
Remember?
That was the game
Galen's just describing the medicine
And what happens, you know
You've got to be Christed with the poopies
And then
And then what?
The worst thing is those people
Doing the Phoenician thing
Who are also doing the lesbian thing
And when I say lesbian
What do you know what I mean from lesbos?
Right, what does lesbos
What does this word mean?
Lesbos is an island
People, remember that
Let's all go to lesbos someday
Maybe the next one
What does lesbos
Or what does it mean to
Lesbiozzo someone
It says, do like the lesbian women
Thank you, we knew that
Or Latin
Felare
Felare
No
It's the wrong song
It's the wrong term
And this one
Is the word we use in English
When we say
Felatio
Yes, this is to perform
Felatio
Now
He's saying
The most medically
Questionable
Are the people who are
Involved in Felatio
Who are also
Doing the Phoenician
And what is the Phoenician thing they're doing?
What is the Phoenician?
Well, that's an
That's two
Imitate the Phoenicians
Well, how so?
Well, you know,
Victorian Alfred tells us
It's unnatural vice
Unnatural vice
So I see
This is somebody
Who is performing
Felatio
Upon
That
Poopy
Phoenician
Dragon
Yeah
That's exactly what he's saying
So that one medically
Is the most, you know
If you're Christing in this way, people
You know, they used to tell us
When I was, you know,
Youthful
They used to say
You know, watch out for HIV
I was back with Dr. Fauci
I was reading his papers
In graduate school
Shout out to Dr. Fauci
I read your papers, brah
And the things that you did
To make progress in HIV
Research and acceptance
Of not shunning people
With a disease
That was, you know
You got crad, man
You got crad in the under
You got crad, definitely
Hail Satan
Let's go to the
Let's go to the
Oh, look at this
We're getting some comments
I love that
Flash those up there to me
Make sure you get the good ones
Right?
Yeah, let's go to the next one
Here's the phoenix
We knew that
You know, here's the purple
I just wanted you to see the purple
We got purple women, you know what I mean
The Phoenician women
That we talk about
Keep going
That wasn't really relevant
I wanted to move
Are we...
Oh, here's Homer
Homer, look people
I just want to show you
End of the first line
Look at the second and last word
Phoeniki
I just want you to see
This purple stuff
It's in the oldest documents
That we've got
Right?
So when you see them
Dying things
In say, Homer
Like they like to die
Halters for horses
They like to die
The belts
Belts were a big thing
Aphrodite has this gorgeous
Beautiful belt
So stained with purple
She's been baptized with purple
Oh, God
Who wants that?
Who wants that?
Raise your hand if you want
Aphrodite, Cestus, please
Please
Ah
It's got the purple
We got it going
Right?
Galen's, you know
This is old, old, old
Right?
This tech is
Ancient to them
So they would look at you funny
You know, for not knowing it
Right?
With the
With the ocular Christing
Here she is
Right?
That archeress
Who's so devastating
To the civilized world
Because she can gallop
Shoot backwards while she's galloping
It's terrible poison that they've got
Look at her
She is rocked on that stuff
Right?
So by the time Galen's right
This is old, so don't be surprised
Like, look, if you've been Christing
If you've been Christing in your mouth
Um, this is the
This is what you're going to have to consider
Right?
It's just being a good doctor
For the things that are being done in society
If you were Christing in the mouth now
Right?
Ah
You know, they were given different advice
Right?
But the Christing is there
Right?
The Christing is the application
Are you telling me
Christ is the application of a drug?
Yes
And in this case
It's the application of a drug
That is mixed with feces
From you having performed activities
On a canitis
In the dance of your religion
Yeah
Let's go to the next one
Let's go to the next one
People are still like
Oh, God, I don't know
Which way is up?
What about this doing this Phoenician thing?
Right?
What about doing this Phoenician thing?
Well, there's something called a schulach
This is from
This is the ancient lexicon
We're looking at now
The schulach
Most people translate this as dog or puppy
And it's generally puppy
He says the schulachs is a type of aphrodisiac
Just like that
Which is used by the Phoenicians
Now, he doesn't say the Phoenicians here
He says by those who are doing the Phoenician thing
Like the dogs, the Heracles
Yes
Yes, believe it or not
Believe it or not
Christ me, baby
Right?
Right?
Okay, let's see
Let's see where this goes
Let's see where it goes
Hit me with the next one
I want to give to you
I want to give to you
We just had puppy
Look at the second to the last line
The second word is schulakitin
Schulakitin
Remember, everybody in Greek
You're practicing
Right, you can say it after me
And they had an excellent session
Lab yesterday was good
It was good
Thank you, everybody who showed up
And all the TAs that are working
Remember, you can avail yourself of that
Every Saturday at 12 central
You can go there, right?
And ask questions
Love it
Oh, God, it's good
Have a good time
Look, people
Let me bring us to the origin
Of everything that we've been talking about
All of this magic
Look at the connection here
With the schulakitin
This is what you call
Hecate
This is what you call her
She's that one who is associated
With that aphrodisiac
I thought it was puppies
Yes, and that's why your
That's why your Patreon blows
Right, because your evidence is garbage
Because you don't read the text
Who are we talking about
When we're talking about Hecate
Let me just read this to you
Let me just translate it to you
Right, I call upon Hecate of the way
She whose way is divided into three parts
The desired one
The Uranian one
The Cthonian one
And the one who comes from the sea
She wears that peplos
That is crocus colored
She wears it
She's the one who hangs around in the tombs
She's the one who becomes metabolic
Do you know anybody like this?
She becomes metabolic
With the souls of the dead
Have you ever known someone
You can read around for images
Have you ever known someone
Who has brought you to the place
Where you are metabolic
With the dead
Have you ever been there?
I'm asking you seriously, Satanic congregation
Have you ever danced with the dead?
Have you ever?
Well, they did
And she is the one who leads that dance
Do you understand?
Do you have ears to hear?
She's the one who leads that dance
This mystery is ancient religion
This thing birthed Judaism Christianity
It birthed them
Right?
She is the one behind the cup
Fantastic
Now you know why they called the Medwa
The one who knew all the drugs
They said she was the daughter of Hecate
The daughter of Hecate
Let that sink in
Let it sink in for a minute
And you begin to understand
Remember, think of it anthropologically
Let it sink in
Love it
Oh, God
Give me the hymn again
And what else is she?
Look, she's got power in all three realms
The weird thing about Hecate
Is that the Zeus said, hey
She has to have total power in all three realms
She has to control what's here
What's up and what's down
She has to control the air, the earth, and the water
Right?
She has to possess all of those realms
Right?
Now you know why she can get
Bacchic with the dead
Right?
Okay, what else does she love?
She's the daughter of Persees
And she loves the void
Have you been into the void, Satanic congregation?
Have you been there?
Do you have the star in your hand?
Have you jumped into that void?
She is the guide in the void
Yeah, isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute
I know that when you go into the void
In antiquity, the edamon
When you go into it
That you're meeting the devil
You're meeting Satan
Didn't you think this was Saturnian?
Did you think you were getting anywhere out of the garden?
Did you think seriously?
Yeah, that's her
Okay
Okay, right
Are they picking it up?
Yeah, I think they're getting it
And we're ready to transmit
Beautiful
Okay, here we go, people
What else is she?
She is that one who is of the night
She is the one who is of that aphrodisiac
That we use when we foiniquizo
Okay
She is that inescapable bossy layer
She is the one who makes that aphariac rumble
You know the thunder that you get out of the cup?
Can you imagine getting thunder out of a cup?
Oh, you say, oh, that's silly
You haven't had the cup
Yeah, she's the one who brings it
Give me the next one
What else is hacka-tina?
If you go wikipedia hacka-tina
You're going to find the biggest bunch of
Well, it may have good stuff on there
See if they talk about sources
But if you want to go out there and search for hacka-tina
You're going to find the most ridiculous
Take off the goth stuff
Come on
What a ridiculous
She's also the daoropoulon
Now, people will translate that as bullherder
Bullherder, well, that makes sense
She dances with ghosts and she herds bulls
Remember what that Tauros is
I taught you last time
That Tauros is that genitalia
She's the one who masters that bull
Okay, and she's a nymph
She's a nymph, yes, and she's a leader
And she's a nourisher of the children
Because you know what the one law is
That none of us ever, ever question
You know what that one...
Oh, I didn't tell you guys that
The one thing the universe never questions
Is the value of nourishing children
She is the child nourisher
If you cannot stand before she who nourishes children
If you can't stand before her because of who you are
Or what you've done
You got no place
You got no place with us
All right
Do you see where Jesus took a little tiny step over the line
He just took a little tiny step
Oh, God, you're going to scandalize me
You're going to scandalize me
Oh, stop, you're going to scandalize me
Shut up, Jesus
Continue Christing that kid, you freak
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
And so what happens?
She's a child nourisher
You know what I mean?
We pray to her as the Korah
All of us who have been initiated
That's all part of the deal
Give me the next one
Now, Hezekius, when you pull him up and say,
Hey, Hezekius, tell us
What is the Hekate anyway?
What is that Hekate anyway?
He says it's a Xulon
A Xulon is a steak
It can't be just a piece of wood
But here it's a piece of wood
That they tie or bind
Somebody who's guilty
Who's done bad things
They tie him to it
And then they beat him
Do you like that?
So what is the Hekate?
The Hekate is what you get with justice, baby
That's what you get
You do something bad to a kid
We're going to tie you to a steak
And we're going to beat you
We're going to beat you and whip you
Oh, wow
That's fantastic
Doesn't that now, people, come on
Can't you feel good about that?
That is satanic justice, baby
You don't get that kind of justice
From any other kingdom
That belongs to Satan, baby, right there
Oh, God
Don't you love that?
Who wants to go?
I want to go
Is that part of the cult?
After the vision thing?
Do we all get to beat up freaks?
Yeah, you know
Let's go for it, baby
I love it
Oh, give me the next one
Give me the next one
We're done
And next one
Boom
Now, Hekate, they'll tell you is also the throwing
No, let's forget you
It's the throwing
Henry Cavill still loves you
It's the throwing of the javelin
Or the hurling of a bolt of some sort
Like an arrow
What do you call Hekate?
They call Artemis Hekate
Why?
Because she is that Iohaea
The pour of poison arrows
The pour of poison arrows
You mean Hekate?
Is this divinity?
Yes
Hekate is that one who shoots that bow
She is the one who
Oh, God, you know what she...
You know who walks around with her?
A whole bunch of black wolves
Odysseus was so scared once
Why is that?
Because Cersei...
Remember, Odysseus has been held for seven years
By one woman named Calypso
And then he gets captured by another woman
Which was probably just the trade to start with
I'll bet you that's what it was originally
It was just the trade
But he ends up with another woman as her sex slave
And what happens in the process?
What happens in the process?
When he whines and complains a lot
He cries on the beach
He sits and cries on the beach
This is the Bronze Age, man
You mean he wasn't...
Oh, my man!
No, he wasn't
He wasn't tanning his testicles either
No, he was being held captive by a woman
And crying a lot
She abused him and pumped him full of drugs, man
What a world!
What a world!
And what did Cersei teach him?
She said, you want to go to the underworld?
And he was like, yeah, I do!
I want to see my daddy!
Right, or whatever
Whoever it was that he was going to see his dad
Still alive at that point
But whoever it was
Or the Killies or someone that...
Oh, Agamemnon
Right, oh, God
Right, because when he got back
He got killed
By another woman who was called the Dragon Priestess
Did you know that his wife was called the Dragon Priestess?
Who, in their right mind
Would mess around on somebody called the Dragon Priestess
Seriously
He had it coming
He came back with this priestess that he abducted
And was...
I can't use the R word
Yeah
And he's got her with him
So, guess what?
The Dragon Queen bashed his head in
While he was taking a bath
She buried Naxx in his brain
After putting and wrapping him up in a net
Yeah, carpet
Isn't that funny?
I think it was purple, I don't know
Go back and check
Somebody check
What it...
The period is not what you think it is
The world is not what you think it is
We live in a world that is heavily, heavily, heavily misogynist
Whether people are throwing acid in the face of women
Or whether they're saying
You got to walk 10 feet behind me
Or I'm going to go in this section
And you got to go sit up there
Because that's where all the people like you sit
Right?
They weren't doing that then
Yeah
There was something, a power
There's power in the femininity
There's power in it
That's what you find in Hecate
Right?
Classical authors are known for saying
Hecate
Once a month, all the rich bastards
Right?
Who don't deserve to hoard what they've got
And starve everybody else
All the rich bastards have to go down
To the shrines of Hecate
And they have to leave food
Nice food too
Not these canned goods garbage
Nice prepared meals
Nice
And you know who goes and picks them up?
It's all the poor people
It's all the poorest of the poor
Because that is what Hecate does
Yeah
You know that feminine goddess you thought existed?
This is her
This is her
This is the ultimate and highest enemy
Of Judaism, Christianity and Islam
And you know who can tell you that?
Is the people
The people, the women and the burkas
Who are starting to fight
That's who you can tell about that
Oh God
Tell the Philistine women too
Tell them all
Love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Got a little patriotic there
Yeah
Look what's happening people
What comes out of the mouth of Hecate?
She says, I tell you
What do I tell you?
I tell you all things true
Imagine that
A force of nourishment
A protector of the poor
Who only speaks the truth
Do you see where Jesus had His model?
Jesus is not a made-up figure
Jesus is not a fictional character
The people who arrived in the New Testament
Are not trying to take Greek figures
And just slam them down
Right from the literature
Right down into their own works
They're not doing that
Jesus is living in a system
That venerates this identity
When he goes down to Egypt
And he's got his trust fund
Comes back so educated
What do you think he was educated in?
Yeah
In the language of Greek
That this thing
That this mystery
The word mystery is a Greek word
The word mystery is a Greek word people
The word Christ is a Greek word
When are you going to see it?
Christ Jesus is that Hecatech light
When he says, I'm the light of the world
Give me the next one Chewie
Give me the next one
I'm the light of the world
Watch
You know where he's stealing that from
You coprophagic
Next one
Who is the Hecatech?
Here's a little section that
Medea is talking about
Who Hecatech is to her
And she says she lives within her inner chamber
In the very most sacred nooks
Of her inner chamber
Ladies, listen to me
The great queen says
In the depths of her inner chamber
Dwells Hecatech
I suspect you'll understand that
I suspect you will
There's something earthy in that
She's that power
And who does Medea go to
For that power?
As a matter of fact, who is Medea?
What is her title?
She is a priestess of Hecatech
She comes right out of your hearth, people
Right out of a woman's hearth
Comes Hecatech
Mmm
Mmm
Okay, go, give it to me
Next one
Mmm, right out of her hearth
Love it
And by the way, you know, Pausanias is going to tell us here
You know, the people from Ijina
Remember Paul from Ijina, the physician we dealt with
Love it?
The people from his hometown, his island
What do they do?
They worship Hecatech, right?
And they initiate people
They create the initiates, right?
Once a year, they have this festival
And Orpheus, he says
Orpheus brought this worship to Thrace
Right?
Calling it the mystery, right?
Calling it that initiation, keep going
Right?
So we're right in the middle
When you look at the models that Jesus Christ used
Who is the light of the world
Hail Satan
Who is the morning star
Right?
Look at what, look at what Hecatech produces
Hecatech produces
A phasmacy
Hecatech voice
What do they do?
What does she produce?
She produces images
Right?
Images, ghosts that are full of light
Hecatech, light, ghosts
Hecatech, light, phantasmagoria
Okay?
Everything that the church based its images
Of the whole and the light
And the hail
Is an attempt to reproduce Hecatech
Light
Making image
Love this stuff, love this stuff
You didn't know it was magic, did you?
Of course it's magic
Where do you think, how do you think
You can actually generate this stuff
If you're not on the aphrodisiacs
Go
Give me the next one
We're almost finished there
Here's, oh God
I just want to show you what you feel
Aphrodite is the last two words
The first line
What is the smile or laughter
Loving Aphrodite?
What does she say?
She's like, look
I don't see any problem with what you're saying
You know who you are baby
You are the one
Who guards that bed
Of the highest God
Yeah
You are the one that guards the bed
Of that highest God
Isn't that gorgeous?
Talking about Eila
Think about that for a minute
What are you going to use
In the process?
You're going to use some to guard that bed
You're going to use something that is
Of the air
Of the earth
And of the water
You're going to have drugs
Do you want to know what the yonks is?
It's a drug to bring back
Someone who no longer desires you
You mean you can drug someone
Into desiring you?
Yes
And they're doing it all the time
They're doing it all the time
Good, give me the next one
We're coming close to the finish
These are the things I wanted you to see
That they're dying
They're dying those straps and thongs
Rains
They say
Good, good, good
That's what they're dying
This is not a big deal
But here's what you yell
When you're in the middle of the process
The alalatos is that loud shouting
It's a cry of victory
It's the hallelujah
Of the person who enters
Into the hecatic image
It is the shout
Of the person within the hecatic image
Give me the next one
What are we talking about people?
We're talking about a Christ
Who is staining
Parts of the mouth and throat
We're talking about a right
That involves drugs
That involves sex
That involves enlightenment
That involves opening the mind
And how that right changes
And is contorted, is changed
And everybody in here
I get tons of communications
Hey, Mom, what are you doing?
Both comments and people talking
On another channel or something
People talking about this
I have no, okay
I understand that Jesus is corrupting the right
I understand that
He is not acting as a curotrophos
I get that
But he is achieving the same outcome
Does that justify us for the first try?
Look, people, you know what it sounds like?
It sounds like you're being theological
And I've got no interest in that
I don't care
I don't care what the ramifications are
We don't care
All we want is what they were doing
We want the evidence
We want to protect those sources
And we want that evidence
That's all we want
It's gonna lie like it's gonna lie
And if you're scared
Because of the implications, just
Just wait
For the evidence
It'll surface and you will love it
And that's why people
I feel like I can go to bed at night
Without worrying that I haven't
Ripped off 900 people
That I haven't taken anything from them
Or caused them to buy anything
Notice you have never had to purchase anything
With the exception of those of you who have bought
The Greek textbook, but that's not mine
Right?
And a lot of you are pirating
Right?
Shh, don't tell anyone
Oh, God, the publishers will be knocking at the door
Hey, what is this?
People keep pirating your book
The muse, the chemical muse
Good, good
That's what I say
I go out there and give them a piece in my mind
Give me the next one
No, that's the next one
That's what the poopy
He's covering with the poopies
Hit me with the next one
Boom, and that's the bell
We don't need that
Give me the one under that
The final one
I just want to leave you off with this
There's a dude named Oyneas
Yeah, yeah
And he gave that
Zostera
That girdle, that belt
That was shining
With the purple
Big deal
I can buy a purple belt at Walmart
Right?
Okay
Has much greater meaning
To the people who are wrapped up in the culture
And who are performing these actions
When you see Galen talking about people doing things
Like Christing somebody's mouth
And throat with poop
You have to put yourself in the shoes
Of that civilization
You have to respect
At least respect the process
If you don't understand what they're using it
Or what it's for
Because that's not what we're here to do
We're not here to say
Oh, this is terrible
I mean, you can
Feel free
It makes me a little bit sick
Right?
It should
But we're not here to create a theology
That purple belt is a thing of value
Because of what it does
Not because it costs so much to make
Because what it does
That purple belt of Aphrodite
That contains the sting
That creates everything
And Hecate
Is the one who harnesses that power
In every realm
Okay, I don't know how to translate that into modern physics
I don't know how to say that
That's how they're looking at it
You guys figure it out
What corresponds to what?
I don't understand
That is Hecate
She of the Black Wolf
Thank you for coming tonight
I want to say a couple of things
Please, if you get another chance
Look at some of the stuff
My old boy who's doing pronunciation guides and whatnot
Look at that
And everybody's having a problem with Unit 2
Keep reading
Keep reading
Don't worry, it's supposed to be tough
It's supposed to be tough
But you can get through it
And I'll show you how to do that
It is my honor and distinct pleasure to have you
At the bed of the Muse
And I hope tonight that despite the graphic nature
Of what's going on in antiquity
That you may have come to a place
Where you can taste that history a little better
But when you can do that
You know yourself just a little bit
Just a little bit
Now run out and tell all of your family
And everybody you know what it means
To Christ somebody
Thank you for coming tonight, Hail Satan
