Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation.
This is our final episode in the season.
We'll have a Bible study on Wednesday and then we'll be done
with the 5th season. We'll move on to the 6th and the 7th and then we're wrapped.
I want to say thank you for coming tonight and I want to let you know
what we have on hand for tonight are these sources that people don't look at
and we just stumble upon and I just want to bring you a real gem of a source tonight
that it's brand new but I knew that you would like these guys.
This is a gang of drug dealing cultic pornax.
Yeah, they are the ones who were doing the pornea and tonight
tonight we're going to bring them forward for you and show you on Lady Babylon.
Music
I want to start tonight off with a couple of comments.
Just throw things out there that people are saying, hit it Chewie.
Let me read this one. How can we get Medea back to rule again?
I'm totally on board.
Hail Medea. Thank you so much Valerie Moore.
Thank you so much Valerie Moore.
I mean it couldn't be more agreement with you.
Yeah, how can we bring back Lady Babylon?
That's the question. Let's see if we can answer that somewhere today.
Chewie, give us another one.
Yeah, this is from Jacob who apparently is a Rx.
That's Rx prescriptions, right?
Humble or receives them anyway.
Humble to see my stupid comments made the cut.
Be right back. I need to call my mom now and tell her we made it.
Fantastic. Jacob who's probably in pharmacy schools somewhere.
I'm sure you and mom are proud.
I'm sure you are proud and I'm proud to have been able to foster our growth together.
I love it. Thank you for responding. I love that.
Love it. It tickles me. Tickles me.
I want to reach out and touch you.
I want you to know that I'm there as you're watching.
I am there with you.
And tonight we're going to bring, I'm going to bring you our first guest.
Let's just get right to him.
His name is Phil Octides.
And this, this Prince drug user made the pages of the ancient world.
He made the post.
People were writing about him.
You know, he's from, he's a Thessalian.
Yeah, Royal Lion.
He's got a, he's got a whole background in the drugs.
He was raised by the centaurs, right?
You know, that kind of group.
These are the guys using the poison.
These are the guys who were following Chiron, right?
These are the ones who have that blood, the blood of the centaur.
You know, there are centaurs in the Bible.
You didn't know that.
Maybe, maybe you'll appreciate it now.
If you go back and you look at the Greek, which is the oldest.
And you say, Hey, what are the centaurs doing there?
They're pedarasts, right?
Pedarasts.
Remember, we're in a very specific field.
This is educational.
Where's my educational whip?
This is educational.
We need to present this in the right education.
What I'm giving you is the actual right.
And I'm showing you Phil Octides.
Chewie.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Did you see that junkie in all his glory?
Did you see him there?
You know why he's got the problem?
It was because of Goldie.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She had her own island.
Yeah.
And he got hooked on the Viper.
Stank everywhere you took him.
You could smell it.
Yeah.
And we didn't want him around us.
You know, it was the guys in constant pain.
The guys in constant pain.
Did you see the description we looked at last time
about what happens to you when you cook your brains on this stuff?
Last time we left the guy, he was having convulsions.
He was having convulsions.
We were talking about death states and convulsions.
Yeah.
Right.
We also saw, by way of review,
that the theriac is meant to counter a drug
that is causing intense pain.
Intense pain.
This combo of venoms causes intense pain.
Yeah.
Intense pain.
We need things to balance that.
Phylloctetes didn't have it.
So he's always in pain.
He was the only guy who was able to burn Heracles.
He was the only one.
Dude had a shirt.
Dude killed his wife and his child.
And then he goes in, you know,
ends up in a shirt full of poison.
And this stuff isn't just,
this stuff is meant to incinerate.
Yeah.
And Heracles goes out in his deification.
This is the way of Chiron, guys.
Did we see it last time?
We saw it last time, right?
Everybody in the congregation is there.
We're looking at that formula now.
This is wonderful.
This is wonderful.
What am I bringing you tonight?
I want you to see more drugs.
I want you to see more drugs.
I want you to see more drugs
that are involved in the sex rights
that we know Jesus
with all of His technical terminology
was involved in.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ as a son of God.
He wouldn't have been the son of God.
He wouldn't have also been the only begotten.
That's a title within the cult.
Jesus Christ,
the guy who gets arrested
in a takedown at a public park
at 4 a.m. yelling,
I am not a trafficker.
That guy,
his cult that he is involved in
from which he is taking all of these titles
produces this sort of junkie.
Yeah.
Yes.
And I say junkie with the greatest affection
for every junkie out there.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's that search.
You can't...
Watchers tell me.
Tell them to stop.
Tell them to stop.
Every generation finds it.
Every generation looks for it.
Yeah.
It's fantastic.
It's the mental chemistry of humanity
all splayed out on history
like some kind of Jackson Pollock painting.
Love it. Love it.
Let's bring up some Greek and get dirty.
I want to get down and dirty.
And some of this is dirty.
I will be as technical and as educational
as we can possibly do this tonight.
Right?
Because that's where we need to keep it.
Be decent people.
Some of this material may turn you on
in some mental way.
Light up the stuff that's in there.
Yeah.
Let's try it.
Let's throw some of these drug dealers at you guys.
Okay.
Bring that first...
Yeah.
We start at the top.
I just want to start with a little bit of correspondence here.
Believe it or not, from some guy named Ewoks.
Yeah.
He's apparently, you know, of Arabia.
And it's just...
To who? Tiberius?
The Imperator?
Yeah.
He's a king.
He's writing to Tiberius.
He's like, dude, I got your gifts.
I got your gifts.
The Centurion.
What's his name?
Right?
He brought them.
He brought them.
And, you know, it's so nice to see them.
You know, I'm going to return around and give it back to you.
I'm going to give it back to you.
And I got something coming to you.
You know what that is?
Oh, you're going to get the goodies.
You're going to get those things about those works that are on the stones of healing, the
stones of medicine, that earth, compressed earth of medicine.
Yeah.
You're going to...
And go back to that.
I'm sorry.
This was...
Oh, sorry.
Keep it on there.
Keep it on.
Gorgeous.
Oh, I love that.
Yeah.
I feel it.
God, it's gorgeous.
Thank you, Chewy.
That was fantastic.
Sometimes I short Chewy too much on those times and Chewy is genius, right?
Yeah.
So, yeah, this is all those things that bring us to the Remediorum.
Remediorum.
Remediorum to the drugs.
Woo!
We made it to the drugs.
Hit the next one.
Let's go in.
What was that?
They were writing back and forth about...
I'm going to give you these.
I'm going to give you the sources on this and you can make this drug.
Those guys were used...
There's not an emperor that wasn't using drugs, man.
You can get them all.
This is fantastic.
Let's go to these drug-using people and see what they're writing about.
Here's some Greek.
Oh, I love this.
This is in the back.
If you go to the...
If you find Orpheus and the lithica and you snoop around a little bit, Auto-Kern and
people that came before, you'll find this collection as well.
It's described as a kind of a summary of the teachings.
It uses the same word that we use in the New Testament to say to preach.
Yeah, so these are the preachings, the lithic preachings of Orpheus.
Are you ready?
And you say, Orpheus, yay, we're all in cult.
Now, look at these people.
I'm about to give you cult texts, full of drugs and sex and cult and the real origins
of the mystery.
Nobody's doing this.
Why?
It's not magic.
It's just the sources because we're respecting them.
I'm not sitting here trying to sell you a line.
I'm not trying to get you to buy a book.
I'm not trying to get you to believe some kind of argument so I can be on some kind
of BS ride of looking at myself in the mirror and all of that circle jerkery.
I have no interest in that.
Here's the text.
Let's bring this up.
See what these druggies said.
Let's bring it up.
Okay, look at this.
Okay, you're going to love this, people.
I'm so excited.
I'm glad you can only see me from the neck down.
Lethos ostrites.
Oh, look at that.
What kind of lethos is this?
It's something called ostrites and all of my great students.
It's got the oistress root in it.
It's got the oistress root.
What is that?
Oistress?
That is the bow poison.
It's the madness you get in.
It's the state you get in.
Okay, sorry.
Let's calm down.
Calm down.
There's a lethos called ostrites.
Yeah.
And when it's combined with wine and consumed, it's a complete remedy for pain.
It gets rid of all pains.
Totally.
That's it.
You're done.
No more pain.
You can't have pain on this bad boy.
Okay, right?
Here we are at the rave.
Here we are at the rave in 500 BC.
Wait, what?
Nice rave.
Let's see what we're doing.
Look, we're on cypress.
Boom, boom, boom.
You hear the music?
Right?
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Here it is.
What kind of drugs, people?
What kind of drugs?
As you get off the boat, you're coming.
What kind of drugs do you want for the festival?
Right?
Here we are.
Here we are.
Here's the first one.
It's going to get rid of all your pain.
Pain.
No pain.
No pain.
And why is this so important?
Because otherwise, with what you take, with what we're going to put into your rectum,
I'm being scientifically and historically accurate.
With what we're going to put into your rectum,
you're going to need some painkiller
because you will run around screaming otherwise.
Okay, okay.
Fantastic.
I'm there.
So give me that one.
Right?
Historically.
Not me now, right?
But historically.
Historically.
Don't take it there.
This isn't some dirty street corner.
This is the museum and the place where we educate.
Educate.
Excellent.
Excellent.
So here we are.
Let's get that same one.
It's got another drug underneath it.
This is great.
It's like we took down an ancient drug dealer.
So what do you got?
What do you got from Cyprus?
Look, what I'm just going to describe it in the middle of Cyprus.
You don't believe me.
I'm saying Cyprus on purpose.
That's where we're going.
The Adelphi.
The sister to these, right?
Is Ehitis.
Some kind of substance called Ehitis.
And it is named that way from the Echidna, the viper.
Yeah.
Which a long time ago they say phylloctides was healed with this.
Oh, isn't that nice?
It's wound.
Take it down.
He was finally brought off.
He had been there the whole time with Goldie.
Goldie was there.
Who's Goldie?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Okay.
In the life of any junkie, of any junkie who follows the gods.
In the life of these people is always, is always an oracle.
Always.
The gateway is open.
There's no other reason to be there in the midst of the pain.
There's no reason.
It's that oracle, right?
And his oracle, Goldie, drew him in.
She drew him in.
And she created that mortal whose immortality is given at the drop of that one.
That golden rod of Hermes, that golden rod of Hermes.
He uses it to wake you up.
It's after he puts you to sleep.
It's after he puts you to sleep.
Okay.
So there's going to be some of that, you guys.
Don't be, don't be scared, right?
We still got the music going.
Everything's cool.
Get back to those drugs.
Let's bring it back.
This is as much cult as we can bring forward tonight.
Yep.
Oh, love it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Next one.
Let's go.
The next one.
That's good.
We covered it.
Yeah.
Oh, I just wanted you guys to see the second sentence in this.
Now, wait, I'm going to show you something through this that is perhaps the most marvelous
and interesting thing that I've seen in a long time.
Look what happens, people.
Drugs, what are these children of the Greeks doing?
They're crazy to jump into these schemes where they're running after the drugs that cause
you to hear the demons, the demons.
You know what those young people are out there doing?
They're chasing the drugs that allow you to hear the demons.
Welcome to Cyprus.
You are here to find the voice of the diamond.
Yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
It's Goldie.
It's Goldie.
It's Goldie.
That's what they call Aphrodite.
Fantastic.
Back to the next.
Oh, let's give this one a second.
Gorgeous.
Okay.
Don't you love the classical art that we have all along?
This is both like an art history and an informative lecture on ancient pharmacology.
Love it.
Love it.
I'm hoping I'm putting people to sleep.
I've got to keep it exciting.
What do these children of the Greeks do?
This is what they do.
They make haste to follow these avenues where you can pick up these voices and you say,
wait a minute.
So in their mystery cult, they wanted to hear voices.
Yes.
In their mystery cult, the hearing of the voices is the breaking through.
Well, you say this is quite a revelation.
You want to have an altered mental state that is not just a place of euphoria and bliss.
Yes.
Turns out the bad trips are as important as the good.
Yeah.
That's what they said.
Not me.
Not me.
That's why you have so many of the Thanasimon, those drugs that induce the death state.
This is Hermes.
He's going to use that wand on your rectum just to give you a historical reality.
He's going to wake you up from your death.
You're not going to drink it because you're going to be dead.
He's going to bring you back.
Yeah.
And you'll thank him.
You'll thank him.
Turn you into a place you've never seen.
Oh, open things up.
It's a good purgative.
Let's hit the next medical one.
We're thanking like they did in antiquity.
Praise Jesus.
Yes.
Right.
Excellent.
This is another one called Ophite.
And that's from the root for serpent.
I'll just translate it to you.
This thing is a antifarmicon.
It's a drug combo that's paired with others.
And it's used for anything that you're applying that serpent venom to.
Isn't that nice?
They use it in the eyes for people who have problems seeing.
And it takes away headache.
And for those who use it, who are chronic users,
those who are chronic users, you know what happens to them?
They get better hearing down to the point that they can hear just the very slightest
conversation.
What?
This thing gives you superpowers.
Right?
You're able to hear better than you were before.
Oh, interesting.
And what else does it do?
I love this last part.
It starts on with Fossi.
Fossi, decaiton, achineton.
Yeah.
And with respect to those who are achinetic, take it down.
What is achinetic?
Well, in medicine, ancient medicine, achinetic is when you have no movement.
No movement in your skirt.
Yeah.
You are achinetic.
That driving force is not driving.
And do you know what happens when your skirt?
We're Mediterranean, so we wear skirts, right?
Don't.
Right?
We have to stay precisely accurate historically here, right?
If your skirt has no movement, this drug can make things work.
Can make things work.
Let's see.
Let's see the rest of that recipe for disaster here.
What are we giving the people who are coming to the concert tonight?
This is amazing.
Yeah.
They're going to be able to see better and hear better.
And the ones that are achinetic are going to be led to aphrodisia.
And even some, you know, maybe some lightheadedness too.
Some lightheadedness.
But all of this is coming to us through that epithomeon, right?
Through kinesis, the movement and the epithomeon.
Epithomeon is desire.
It's sexual desire, right?
Right?
Blow this up a little bit.
Yeah.
No, this is not the one that I want.
Sorry.
Well, out of order.
You're out of order.
These are, this is where it takes you in your mind, right?
This is the kinesis, the motion, right?
This is just the, okay, dance or movement.
Change your revolution.
Kinesis.
You don't have any movement.
There's nothing dancing in your pants.
If there's nothing dancing in your pants, you got to put it in your pants.
You got a problem because you can't go to Aphrodisia.
And one of these Aphrodisia, yeah, these are the pudenda,
the festival of Aphrodite during the month of pudenda,
January, February, March, April, pudenda, May, June, July.
That's how they're ranking the value of this concept.
They can't.
This drug will lead you there.
Of course, we're on, we're in Cyprus, right?
And what do we do?
We get off the boat there in Cyprus.
Now, not today, not today, to my knowledge, not today,
perhaps in a secret kind of way, but to my knowledge, not today.
But in antiquity, when we, you and I get in our ship and go back to antiquity,
we step off the boat, step off the boat and you can smell it, fumigate it.
We're getting fumed the whole way up.
Once we get to the temple, we start partaking in the drugs.
We start partaking in the exercise.
Yeah, good.
Love it.
Love it.
It's healing.
It's healing.
Great.
Next text.
Love it.
Let's keep going.
This is a really distinguished, stiff shot professor because they don't want to talk about
things.
This makes their, their sphincter, sphincterize.
That's from a Greek word for to strangle.
The sphinx is the strangler.
Love that.
Love that.
Strangling is important for history.
Fantastic.
Look at this one.
This is a, what kind of, this is the lethal of strites, right?
I just want you to notice one more time, the pain.
The pain.
Why?
Cause we're going to be seeing more drugs that are going to be counteracting pain.
And here's a big one.
Watch this people.
This is some kind of lethal.
It's called a leap.
Leap baraios.
Leap baraios.
Love it.
This thing they say comes from Syria.
A Syria, excuse me.
And there was a dude, Memnon, famous king, you know, and he took, he took this stuff to
Troy, to King Priam, right?
And it was a great gift, man.
It was a, it was a mega door on.
This is a, this is a great thing that he did.
And what, what did he do?
Well, they say that the mages in Egypt and Babylon put Babylon honor this drug above
all the others, right?
What do they do?
They use it in their epodes and in their goateeus and their goateeus.
What is a goateeus?
It's not what you think it is, but remember we got a junkie, Phyllictides with us.
And this guy's on the purple and we want to see what the purple is causing the people
to do.
All right.
We're following that junkie.
Love it.
Love it.
Okay.
Let's, let's go to the, whoops.
We're off timing tonight, aren't we?
We're off timing.
Do I need to skip a, okay here, I'll try to be better.
Sorry.
Sorry to you.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Hit the next one.
Next Greek here.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Back to that one.
Back to that one.
This is where the magi, right?
They use it in their epodes and their goateea, right?
Not only that, but it has an effect on snakes, right?
And when you drink it, what happens to you?
You become mantic.
You become mantic.
And somebody who sees what the birds see.
And it's by this instrument.
I'm telling you that they rule most, that they carry out most of their art, baby.
Those magicians.
Now we just had a drug guy.
Do you realize what just happened?
You just had a text from antiquity.
You just had a drug guy step out of the past and step up with you and say, you want to
know what those magi are using?
These are the guys that came to see Jesus after he was born from the virgin.
These are the guys that came to see Jesus.
And what did these junkies bring Jesus?
These junkies brought Jesus drugs.
They brought him drugs.
They brought him the basis for making the drugs.
That you only have to add a minor quantity of whatever else it is that's causing the
biological interaction.
These things are bases, frankincense and myrrh.
They're bases.
The gold was so he could, you know, rock in a place in Egypt while he's learning all
his stuff.
He's got to shave his head.
He's got to get educated by the priests.
You know, that's what the gold is for.
Those priests love the gold.
I've worked for priests.
I've worked for priests.
I've worked for one priest who didn't love his gold.
He didn't love his gold.
But the rest of them did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.
Things don't change, do they?
Okay.
Let's get back to the drugies.
Here we are.
Here we are.
Bring them in.
Next text.
Oh, this is marvelous.
This is marvelous.
So this thing is used, the one that he's talking about here is a cure for the eobalon.
Any of these drugs that are being used that are taken from, harvested as venom, right?
These are the ones that this thing can be used as a what?
As a prophylacticon, antifarmacon.
Okay.
So when I yell at the world, they're using drugs and it's a very complex system of
drug use where it's compounds and they're using one group of compounds.
To balance another group of compounds.
And when you put them together, that's when you can do the mystery.
Yes.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Love it.
Love it.
There's the ant.
There's the word antifarmacon.
Anybody out there?
And I know every scholar, every classist out there that's within range of my voice, maybe
it's none.
Maybe it's none.
Well, no, I know at least one.
Yes.
Carl Rock, every once in a while, you know, he will see these texts and hear these texts
and know, right?
This is straight up.
This is straight up cold.
And you are getting it from drug central.
Drug central.
They don't call it mushroom town for any reason.
You know what I mean?
Okay.
Let's go to the next bit of Greek and we'll be, let's round things out.
I've taken 34 minutes.
You time up the sister of this thing.
Yeah.
This is the acutus.
And I just wanted to make sure that you realize that phylloctetes had to be cured, had to
be cured in the process.
Right.
He's, he's aching for those drugs.
He's in constant pain and constant wreckage from his wound.
Yeah.
And he's administering the drug and he's in that state, but he doesn't have that painkiller.
He doesn't have the cure.
So if these wizards are using these drugs and they're balancing them out and you maroon
someone on an island without the supplies that he's going to need, you're going to end
up in a terrible situation where he wants to kill you when you get back.
That's exactly what happens to Odysseus and Odysseus has to try to outsmart him.
What are they all fighting for?
These junkies, the bow and the poisoned arrows.
Right.
Because it's been prophesied by some dude under the influence that this poison will bring
them victory.
Yeah.
Oh, it's fantastic.
You don't see the God in it, do you?
You don't see the God, but the God is there.
This is that blood.
This is that flesh.
You mean they even call it that?
Yeah, they do.
Ambrosia.
You know what's in the cave of Hermes?
The ambrosia.
Give us another drug.
Do we have that little one on the bottom?
Was that a little drug dealer in there?
What is this?
Yeah.
There's another one.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Now we're at a Bacchic rave.
Right.
Now we're at a Bacchic rave.
Music is loud.
Nobody can.
Nobody can.
All we can hear is shouting.
Right.
So everybody shouts.
Right.
And what is the, there's this thing called Nebretase.
Now here it's Nebretase, but that Upsilon is actually a beta.
Right.
So Nebretase, those are those skins, fond skins.
I forgot to tell you, take off your clothes.
Right.
We got off the boat.
Everybody disrobe.
Right.
Everybody disrobes and you get a bath.
You get a bath.
Oh, you thought you were going to show up and be like, no, no, no.
You need to get cleaned up.
Right.
So you get your bath.
Right.
You're all feeling good.
And now we're, we're marching up to the temple.
We're going to be getting hit by the drugs.
We're going to be getting hit by the drugs on the way there.
Bring that back up.
Where's my clothes?
I left us all naked.
No, no, no, no, no.
They're going to give you the skins, the fond skins.
Yeah.
You never wear a fond skin.
Oh, it's nice.
It's nice.
Yeah.
Fond skin.
God, you're not cultured until you are, until you are in a place where you can see both dimensions
at once and wearing fond skin.
So soft, so incredibly soft.
Oh, love it.
Let's see the next one.
Yep.
So this is just a continuation of that passage.
Right.
So this is from those who were using the fond skin, the buckets.
See that up front?
The buckets, right?
And this is for the people who were the therapists.
Yeah.
We got therapists there.
These are the people who are serving the community through the bucket cult.
Thank you very much.
Big hand out for those people.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Drugs, drugs, drugs.
She's got the drugs, right?
Whoa.
Okay.
Those, those people are there too.
And who else?
Then we got just acolytes.
Don't we?
Did we just people following?
Acumuthois.
Yeah.
We got acolytes there.
And acolytes of food, Dionysus.
Bump, bump, bump, bump.
This is fantastic.
Fantastic.
And what is it all leading us to?
It's leading us to Mantea.
Mantea.
What do you want to do when you go to your concert?
All right.
What do you want to do when you go to your concert?
You've been through your purification.
And you're on your way to Aphrodite.
You're on your way.
Don't worry.
She's on the top of the hill in the temple.
Bump, bump, bump.
This is us getting ready.
This is us getting ready to like it.
Go.
Thumping.
Pounding.
Love it.
Love it.
And the pain.
Oh, the pain.
Oh, it's not there anymore.
It's not there anymore because they've given you the drugs.
Fantastic.
This is the way to go.
Does anybody need a prescription for this ride?
This should be doctors should be able to write this out.
Hey, you, you know what you need?
You need a weekend on Cyprus, the festival of Aphrodite.
Okay.
Just do whatever their doctors tell you.
Just take whatever their doctors tell you to take.
Okay.
So here we are.
What does Bacchus do?
He always brings the Aphrodite.
Go to the next text, Chewie, please.
I just wanted to throw.
Wait a minute.
Can we see the one before that?
I meant to give you the, yeah.
Yeah.
We skipped out on this one, right?
This thing has dulled our pain, right?
Especially that from all of the Ophic, all the serpent stuff.
It's Exio Menon.
It's Exio Menon.
Yeah.
What is that X Eos?
You can hear the X plus the Eos.
You can hear that poison.
Did you know the same root in Greek is used to say poison and to heal, poison and to heal.
And this is not one that people will typically, it does this in several different ways in
Greek because they had this concept.
They had this old Pulaski and concept that filters in, filters in through the medical
side.
Yeah.
And they have a, oh, God.
Once we're in the pain, the theriac will boost us to the place that we can contain that
passion, that we can hold that passion and through that power can see her.
That's, that's, that's where we pull up the text again.
I want to see that one more time.
What do we leave off in there?
Yeah.
One word, one word that means to heal and to poison.
If you're Apollo, if you're Artemis, if you're one of the twins, you shoot that arrow.
What's on that arrow?
That arrow is death.
That's the death bringer.
You mean the God of healing is the God of death?
Yes.
Yes.
The chorus leader is that God's sister.
That God's sister is the chorus leader and she's called the poison poor.
Are you seeing it?
People, as we're climbing that hill to the mountain that has the temple where Aphrodite
presides.
Do you see it along the way?
This is she who pours the poison for us.
Fantastic.
I hear that, you know, we're getting closer.
We're getting closer.
You can feel the effects of what they gave me in 800 BC.
This is fantastic.
Same text again, should we please?
Let's finish it off.
What happens also?
You can give it and turn a man into someone who's desirable to a woman.
You can control desire with this thing.
And what else can you do?
Well, it also protects against Egyptian cobras.
Yeah, the venoms that are coming from the cobra that we're using.
These madmen junkies are using who are telling us the future and telling us where to set
our colonies down and directing us to kill tyrants.
These people who are running an empire that stretches from Babylon all the way to the
west side of Europe.
Yeah, yeah, these people, these very same people.
Let's go to one more text.
I'm hitting it, but I just wanted you to see Adam.
I'm going to throw this up there for a little mystery because everybody likes mystery and
you guys like solving things and then telling me what the solutions are.
But I told you we were taking back Eve as she who is a wadzo, right?
And she who is the one entering the Bacchic worship, she whose eyes are being opened.
And Adam, who is Adam?
Who is Adam?
Adam's that guy without whom you're never going to get to the second to last line.
How do they use Adamas?
How do you use Adamas?
Adamas is hard.
Adamas is hard.
How do you use Adamas?
There's a few people here I could ask.
And I know that those people would have very, very good descriptions of what we could do with Adamas.
Yes, but it turns out in antiquity, what do you do with Adam?
You perform magic, which is why the Sibyls said Adam is north, south, east, west.
North, south, east, west.
Do you mean the Sibyls, the pagan Sibyls have Adam?
Yes, they do.
Adam is there before the proto-Hebrew by 800 years.
It's in linear B.
Yes.
Isn't that gorgeous?
To heal and to kill all at the same time.
To heal and to kill with the technical, these Greeks and their technical prowess.
Oh my God, what happened?
What happened to that power?
That power.
Gorgeous.
Love it, love it.
And I think that's, this is our last, right?
We have a, go ahead and flash that.
Go ahead and flash that up there.
Look, I just want you to see a little.
We'll go to this one first, actually.
Look at this.
This is the unconquerable, right?
Adam, the adamao, the one that can't be overcome, the one that can't be overcome.
Isn't that nice?
But if you go to him in Latin, just for the fun of it, it really just means to love.
It really just means to love.
And as Avid shows us there at the bottom, this is the kind of love, take it off.
This is the kind of love that is unlawful.
This is the unlawful love, the unlawful love.
Hmm.
Okay.
Okay.
Did they mean to get the weird Ago and the Septuagint?
Cause they stuck that in there.
The Greeks who wrote the Old Testament stuck it in there.
A reference to an old Etruscan term.
Why?
Because these Greeks and Alexandria were both studying and emulating the same junkies
that you and I are researching now.
When Jesus is doing his thing in the garden with the boy,
screaming, I'm not a child trafficker when the authorities show up in the raid,
when all of that goes down, he is not creating a new world.
Ex nihilo.
He is borrowing from a working tradition of mystery.
Otherwise, Jesus Christ would not have been arrested in a public park at 4 a.m.
with a naked boy.
Okay.
More drugs.
I know you guys are putting up with a lot of drugs.
Just constant bombardment with the drugs.
We're getting to the end of the season.
And what I'd like to do is I'd like to be able to wrap the season in a nice bow and package
just so it all comes together.
People can breathe in a, ah, that will be Wednesday's Bible study.
I appreciate the fact that you are all here participating in this in a way that honors the museum.
We're here because this is the new library for us to find these things.
I promise you, I will not profit off of this.
I will give you the best that I can.
It's free of that rotten greed.
Long live Lady Justice and Hail Satan.
They bring no flowers to me on Sunday.
It's gonna break her heart.
