There's only one
Toxic Venom and Dia's Kiss
Dancing to the bank, catching checks
Cracking whips, Athena with a dark tip
Maltese Island sacred drift
Catherine of the water, purple amethyst
Chickadilla plus one on the list
Bumping tracks in the ride, dark harbor high tide
All wheel drive, poccatane with a theory act
Pauling for Medea, we throw pedophiles to the lions
I'm with a rogue group of Roman rebels
Who make rope and fashion crosses
The root cutters with the black arrows
But they are dreading green
Sacred, your darkest dreams
Come to your history
Days with no use are saved
But they are dreading green
Sacred, your darkest dreams
Come to your history
Days with no use are saved
In touch with what's going on
There's another one coming out
Wake the dead with Sean
Wake the dead with Sean
Fun stuff, fun stuff
But I want you to know
As the Satanic congregation
I want you to know that I'm working hard
I'm working hard to bring these texts
And to show these people
It's a difficult road
We have to maintain the integrity
Of this ship
We have to keep going
Remember, we'll just wait
We'll get there
We're going in tonight
But while the ship is still pushing us back in time
I want to let you know I'm working hard
To be able to bring this reality to light
All we want to do is raise those texts
All we want to do is give people a chance
Yeah, love it
Your eyes will be open
Yes, exactly
Now, if we end up naked
That's the mystery, isn't it?
Fantastic
Tonight, what I've got for you
Is a portrait of the man himself
A portrait of Jesus Christ
Through the ancient Greek
Right into your brain
Oh, God, are you going to love it?
We met his angry, angry father, Yahoo, last week
Last time we left him off
He was bashing heads of children
Oh, God, these texts that I bring here
I bring...
You realize I do this on purpose?
I bring you the...
Just the cream and the crop, man
Just the cream
Just the cream
Oh, God
All the stuff
Nobody will read
Now, tonight, I'm bringing you the stuff
People do read
Or they try to, at least
And I'm going to give a warning
For the evangelicals in the group
You thank...
I just want right off the bat
Right?
Satanic congregation
Get on the throne
Get there into that place
You know, take off
It's time for Satan to take over
Now, what is going to happen tonight?
Tonight, we're going to do a little bit of exposing
After...
After the talk
What I want to do is to bring in Gnostic Informant
Who is at war
This guy is totally at war
He is geared up
We're going to have to put a statue
Somewhere in the museum
Not a huge one
He doesn't need a giant bust or anything
He just needs a modest, you know
Kind of Hercules-themed kind of thing
Because he's working
He's working
And he's working with tax
He's doing...
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that, marvelous
We're back, baby
You can't hold us back
Right? Fantastic
What year is it?
Okay, here we go
Look, it just gave me a time to have a break
But I don't want to waste your time
I don't want to waste your time
Now, we're going to look at some
Ancient texts that a lot of people have looked at
A lot of people have come up with just the craziest
Some of the dumbest ideas about
And they sell these things
They put them online
And you can sell them
Or they have big churches
On the weekend, big gatherings
Big gatherings
Where they sell these ideas
And the people take them
Yum, yum, yum
Love it
Well, tonight we're going to actually look at the texts
And we're going to say
What is it saying?
Just translate the Greek for me, bro
Tonight I'm running interference
I'm running against that grain
We're bringing back Lady Babel
You know what I mean?
You heard me, Lady Babel
The one with the tower
Oh, God, love it
She's gorgeous, right?
She's really, really, really gorgeous
Now, I want to cleanse this place
I want to cleanse it with a poem
And this is a work by Nancy
So thank you, Nancy, for the purgation
Let's get this temple cleaned out
Liminal, by Nancy
Let me enter this harbor from my weak knees
Let my voice fill with hers
New tongues, new waters
Lapping together from the east
Where we dream the oceans
And they always dream us
This
This is the ancient shell game near the shore
Washed from the old depths
To the new heights of uranos
And the return to finally float measureless
Like a child who expects to be born
But not before the heavy pulse of labor
The tearing of flesh
The taste of blood
Copper cleft
In and around the mouth
Whatever waits for me out there
Is only some sunk ship
Layed in with coins
Is just some dead star
Ready to exit our sky
Here I learn to breathe
The breath
Before
To after
Where I find her currents
And I can swim again
Here I rise
I miss took as merely prayer
Thank you Nancy, thank you
That's what we're going to do when we smell sulfur
Right, you bring that poetry out and you cleanse the place
You just get rid of all the trash, right
All those daimonase, they just run away
I'm going to show you some sulfur cleansing
Are you ready?
I want you guys to get ready because we're going to see Yahoo
And we're going to see Jesus
Wait, who? Yahoo and Jesus
That's who we're going to deal with tonight
Standing side by side
Father and son, gods
Oh, these are the ones
Wooo
This is the rock and roll tonight
Yahoo and Jesus
Side by side
Are you ready for this? Who is?
You tell me, well first
I got to take you to where they are
And where Yahoo and Jesus tonight
They're in the apocalypse
They're in the apocalypse, right
I told you guys, I warned you, satanic congregation
All that child sacrifice stuff
Right, I told you, let's stay away
For many things, genocidal
Bad idea
I told you what it would do
It's fueling it
It's the fire for the monster
Love it, it's gorgeous people
This is the most gorgeous physics on the planet
Love it
The potency
Just think about it for a minute
Put your mind in the sandals of antiquity
Right?
That child sacrifice is potent
He was like, give it to me Abraham
Abraham's like, what do you want? Yahoo
Yahoo's like, give me Isaac
Give me Isaac, you know what I mean?
He wants him tied up
He wants him tied up and sacrificed
He's about to do it too
He was this close to doing it
Father's Day of the Year
Now we get to see him
Where are we? We're being judged
Do you people not see the reality?
You've been here, you've been baptized
You know how it is
We're seeing the reality around us
That's the power of the Oracle
That is the song of the muse
Let's bring that forward tonight, shall we?
Thank you for your time tonight, by the way
Give me my first bit here
Chewie, warp it to
Apocalypse, 1823
I hate revelation
That sounds like a...
That sounds like some kind of...
You know what I mean?
You know where I'm from
This is the apocalypse, baby
Yeah, what's gonna happen?
We're watching the destruction
I'm just gonna bring you there
We're watching the destruction
Who died? Who's been destroyed?
Babylon, that great lady
Has been destroyed
He says, look, yeah
There's not gonna be any lighted lamps
In you anymore, honey
There's not gonna be any marriages
No nymphs running around
You're not gonna hear any of that
All that happy marriage stuff
Oh, and all the merchandising
The sales, the markets, groceries
All that happy, prosperous stuff
You're not gonna have this anymore
Especially with those aristocrats
He says, may he stun us
Those big boys
Where they own everything
You know what I mean?
Why?
Why are we getting judged?
Why, tonight?
Is Yahoo stripping us of all of this?
I kind of like the marketplace
Why is he stripping us?
Because...
Pharmakia
Because of your drugs
You got it on the bottom there, people
Especially you evangelicals
Who've never read the Bible
If you're sitting here tonight, an evangelical
And you do not read ancient Greek
And I'm not talking like Kip Greek
I'm talking somebody who's actually read some texts
You've read Homer
And shut up
What is the Bible scholars
The theme tonight, by the way
It's a Bible scholar fest
Because that, I'm trying to get everybody
Tuned up in the Christian mystery
We're gonna be eating flesh here
As followers of Jesus
Right around the corner
Wait until you see what he's dressed in
We're at the judgment
What's going on?
Babylon is burning
Yeah, why?
Because of her pharmakia
Yeah, her pharmakia
That's what caused it
Yeah, her pharmakia
She's caused the people everywhere
To go into a state of planetus
They've become planets
Yes, we wander
We wander
And how do we do that?
We do that with drugs
Pharmakia
What do you think that's there for?
Right?
Are you listening to Yahoo?
Are you listening?
It's because of this
Next verse, let's get that next verse up
Ooh, that was a gorgeous picture
That's nice
Everybody, shout out for Chewie
Who's drugs are they?
That are the enemy tonight
The drugs are yours
They're your drugs
They're my drugs?
They're your drugs
Let's go to the next one
Lady Babylon has drugs
She does
Look, oh, okay
Cue Jesus
Cue him
Bring him in
Oh, God, where is he?
Give me the lion tamer
Come here, Jesus
Come here, Jesus
Christ of Nazareth
They're twelve
And they're all boys, you freak
That was too much
Let's go back to that text
Show us, Jesus
Chewie, give me Jesus
Blow it up
Blow it up
I'm an old man
What does he have on his clothes?
And his maron, his thigh?
Did you know?
Okay, I challenged you tonight
And I said evangelicals, you've never read
The New Testament ever
I know you haven't, the Bible, the whole thing
You've never read it
Here's an example
Did you know that Jesus has a tattoo on his thigh?
He does
He's got a tattoo, that's what it says
And what is it?
It's an onomah
It's a name
Now, listen, nuns, priests, preachers
This name
It's so important because what you have snipped out
What your exorcists have cut out
Is the history of this
It's the name that contains the power
It's the name I can feel you as
It's the name I can feel you out there
You exorcists, I can feel you out there
I've been around you
I know what you are
I know what you are
That's how we always find a way in
Let me show you
How you find a way into the exorcist
Are you ready?
What's written on Jesus' thigh?
Take up his little skirt
Bring it up
Let's see Jesus
Look at that thigh
What's that thigh say?
Basileus Basileon
And Curios Curion
Oh man, it's got a little phrase
Jesus has a thigh
Has a thigh phrase
God, what are these words?
This is the king of kings
This is the king of kings, man
And the Lord
Curios
The Curios, right?
That's the name that they had to fragment
That's the word they had to fragment right there
Curios
In the third century
When they wrote the Septuagin
Or what you call the Torah or the Bible
In Greek, right?
Not translated, but wrote it in Greek
When they did
This is the term Curios
That they took and fragmented
Linguistically, threw it on the ground
And then said, stuck
Their own terms in there for including Adonai
Right?
Including Elohim
They stuck them all in there
Why?
Because this is a Greek term
This is really not anything
But an old Pulaskian term
Yeah, when you go back to Pulaskians
You can take
Gilgamesh and
Dig a hole in your backyard
And bury that third grader
Oh, my God
You can take your library at Nineveh
That's not a library
It's a shopping list
There's nothing in there of any
Redeemable value
It's no wonder those cultures
Never came up with democracy
But ended up attacking democracy
No wonder
The language is who you are
Did you know that?
You are what you speak, baby
You are what you speak
Oh, I see in this dirty place
Is a bunch of Anglo-Saxons
Speaking
Barbarians
Yeah
Speak
There's no music in your logos
You walk, you trudge
Why do you think the apocalypse is here?
Angels, man
Let's show them some angels, chewy
Bring in that angel
Sexy, sexy angel
Yep, no, that's just King of Kings
Let's keep going
King of Kings
Right in this Lord of Lord
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
Go!
Fantastic
Now I'm gonna bring in a chorus
Because you've seen this
But I want you to have this in your mind
Because 500 years before
Any of this foolery that you and I
Are talking about has surfaced
Before Jesus is yelling in the public park
I'm not a child trafficker
While the snaky kid runs off
Standing next to him
got a bandage on his, on his yahoo, on his yahoo, right?
No, this is, I don't know how to be more clinical
than to say his penis is bandaged.
The boy that Jesus is arrested with
has a bandage on his penis.
Okay.
I told you, you don't read the Bible.
You never have.
Here it is.
Oh, this is not the Bible.
This one right here is a chorus
and I'm bringing them back 500 years.
This is Greek that if you don't know this, Dan.
Don't you guys hate smug?
Neal's on a quest to take down smug.
Smug, I'm a Bible scholar.
I'm a Bible scholar.
Bend over Bible scholars.
Here's a fresh injection of a chorus.
Woo!
Fifth century, you're gonna love this, yeah?
If someone know this for a fact, all of you,
say Tenant Congregation, open up your ears.
Know this for a fact.
This is true, what I'm telling you.
If anybody sets about to do something
that is just full of hubris and whether it's a deed
that's done with your hands or your tongue,
you're both, you're guilty in both circumstances.
Those of you who don't have a fear of justice,
those of you who don't respect the powers that be,
Wicked Moira is coming for you.
Ah, Wicked Moira, Wicked Fate is coming for you.
Isn't it great, people, you thought?
We're gonna have throne.
This is the great white throne of judgment.
Fantastic.
You mean we can actually rest in the fact knowing
that the people who perform the genocide
are gonna get justice?
Yes, that's what makes us worshipers of the gods.
Yeah, you and I, say Tenant Congregation,
we worship justice.
Can you hear the power of the Oracle?
Because when we look at Jesus in the apocalypse,
he is that power.
Are you ready?
Let's see him, come on Jesus, come on.
Let's show, give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
How's the show of paintings going?
Do you think they get the subliminal stuff?
I think they do, chewy.
Nod your furry head, no?
Yes, yeah?
Okay, good.
Protomant this.
We're going back to her.
That's where we're going.
The first, do you remember when everything started
with Uranos and Gaia?
Do you remember in the Arche, in the beginning,
when they were?
What happened?
Got that voice.
Eywa, we all said.
Eywa, we all shouted.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you Lucifer, bringer of dawn, thank you.
Thank you for opening our eyes.
We children of Eywa.
Oh God, I love this.
You know what, we're on the way of Cain.
We're on the way of Cain.
Now, for those of you who pretend to read your Bibles,
catch up, go to Jude, look at it, see what it says.
In Greek, don't do it in English,
because it's garbage.
It's totally garbage.
I was, for this translation today, oh my God.
And they all copied each other, right?
The early ones hit it, if King James does it,
everybody else falls in the same pit.
That's how bad biblical scholars are.
Do you know who should be translating?
Needless to tell you this.
You know who should be translating?
The Bible, classical philologist, baby.
Classical philology, you can trust us to translate Homer.
You can trust us to translate Sophocles.
You can trust us to translate a Byzantine dude
like John Tzitzis.
Ah, yeah, that's a sexy name, Tzitzis.
Show me your Tzitzis.
I've got a whole book he wrote.
I've got a whole book he wrote.
That's right.
Okay, I can feel it.
Can you feel that?
I feel it somewhere.
I don't wanna show us, but I feel it somewhere.
Let's go, hit the next one.
Right, before they recover.
Here it is, people.
Right, oh, God, where's this hyma?
Right, it's the hyma, what, wait, what?
There's some prophets and some holy people in this, 1824.
And what happened to them?
Their hyma is in her.
It's in her, yeah, just wait.
Wait, shh, it's in her, the blood.
And what's gonna happen?
The blood of all those who were slaughtered.
That's also, all of great Gaia, right?
You forgot, we're back with Uranus and Gaia, right?
Their offspring, right, and that's where we are.
With them, can you feel them?
Look around, you've thrown.
Look at all the dead people that we've resurrected.
Is he gonna get to the resurrection?
Watch, just wait, Jesus will come in.
He's not mad yet, he gets really mad, though.
Watch what Jesus does when he gets angry, it's kinda scary.
Here it is, 19-1, after these things I heard.
It was this great voice that sounded like
a whole crowd of people.
What are they doing?
They're screaming out of Uranus.
Do you see where we are?
They're screaming out of Uranus.
What are they saying?
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Do you know what it's like when 1,000 people
from up there scream into your head?
Alleluia, mmm, are we smelling Bacchus?
Cause we're getting close, do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it, Dan?
Dan, do you wanna see it?
Let's go, let's do it.
Dan's like, oh, I can't really read Greek,
so this makes sense, right?
Okay, what is coming, people?
Look at the last two lines of that.
Hey, sotiria, the salvation, our salvation.
What is the day today and why did I bother you
and screw up your schedule
and change things from Friday to Saturday?
Because today is the day, March 30th is the day
that great time when we commemorate
the health and the vigor of Rome.
Yes, the health and the vigor of Roma.
Now, I didn't say her sacred name,
but I will continue to leave it in the ether
for those of you who have ears to hear,
you'll pick it up.
And when you receive the name, you won't have to ask me.
You won't have to ask me, cause you'll know it.
Isn't that nice?
That's how it works.
You thought it was come to me and ask me
and just get it enough times and you'll get it.
Nope, it's an experience, the name.
That name written on Jesus' thigh,
lift up Jesus' skirt really quick.
You know, I mean, rub your hand on Jesus' thigh
and for those of you, look, sister is a frustration.
Now would be a good time for you to maybe leave the room.
I know, I know that you are able to come to a place.
Yeah, well, enough said.
Look at the thigh of Jesus
and what's that stuff that's written on it?
What's all that?
That's a power that is harnessed in magic
because what is magic people?
Whole Satanic congregation just raised their hand.
Logos, baby.
That's right, power the logos.
The power of the logos.
This is that logos.
Let's see the next one, bring it up.
Oh God, this is giving me,
this stuff gives me chills to see the physics
behind it gives me chills.
Okay, this is Apocalypse 19 too.
Then he says, because what, what?
His judgments, you know what I mean?
They're all, they're all true, right?
They're all just and what did he do?
What did Yahoo do?
Oh, we're talking about Yahoo.
What did Yahoo do?
He's the one who killed.
Babylon.
He's the one who killed her.
And why would he do such a thing?
Remember, it's because of her drugs.
Yeah, it's because of her drugs.
And that's what it says.
It says, she's the great porne.
What is a porne?
A porne is a woman who works in a temple.
And she does, she performs acts that are,
you could say are somewhere between
a nice music festival
and a medical surgery.
That's what she does for you.
Yeah, that's a porne.
Yeah.
These are the women with whom you won't associate.
You can't.
These are the first women to lose it
because they're right on the front.
When Christianity came after paganism,
when it came after the Republic,
when it pulled down the government around them
and found some slimy SOB named Constantine
to support their political cause.
When they did that and started burning everything,
you know, that's when the, you know,
that Yahoo is in judgment
because that's what Yahoo does, right?
We're gonna watch it.
Watch what Yahoo does.
Okay, now look away from Jesus' thigh for a minute.
Let's pull back, go, go.
Boom, go ahead.
Yeah, this is what everybody's been caught in.
What are all the drugs?
Okay, seriously people.
This is what God hates.
Are you ready?
This is the moral of the universe right here.
What is she being punished for?
This woman that we just called a prostitute.
What is she?
It's her porneia.
You got caught up in her porneia.
You know those 70 virgins that you're gonna get
when you go to Valhalla?
Does it matter?
He's mixing his religions, does it matter?
You're not gonna be able to have sex with him.
Yeah, no, that's the punishment, right?
Fantastic, and some of them are ones
that you threw acid into their faces.
Yeah, so good luck with that.
Yeah, isn't that amazing?
You didn't think the virgins were important, did you?
Of course they are.
Look, it's all in the history.
That's what we gotta look at.
Go, it's the porneia, it's her porneia.
It's her sexuality that Jova doesn't like, right?
Remember, step one, smash the babies against the rocks.
Let their heads explode.
You ever see Satan doing that?
You ever see Satan, we're about to see
what Jesus is wearing.
You're never gonna catch Satan doing this kind of stuff,
ever, ever.
Yeah, interesting, interesting.
Maybe things are backwards.
Maybe things are backwards.
Do you know the first person to think that?
Let's go, next one, next one.
Oh, look at this, look at this.
Yeah, and then what happened, right?
Heard him shout out again.
Remember, we're all sitting there in our state
and we're hearing the voices from Uranus.
Jesus did the same thing.
Made him go into the desert to visit the devil, right?
So you know where we are in the quantum map, right?
Everybody, I assume, is mapping this all out.
You got it in your head, you know?
Okay, good.
Fantastic, I heard another.
Alleluia.
And what was it?
This great smoke came out.
Came up just drifting up.
Where does this smoke go from Babylon?
Where does it go?
It goes into the ion.
He doesn't say it goes up and into the atmosphere.
He doesn't say it goes up and disappears in the sky.
Now, Uranus didn't swallow it up.
Now, he says, what does he say?
I want him to see the exact words, Chewie.
Boom.
It goes up into the ion.
Into the ions, yes, the ions, pearl of ions.
Okay, remember, what is the ion?
It is that shell that is around time.
It contains time.
Yes, but at the same time, it is outside of time.
Okay, so imagine the plurality of the ions.
That's what Pythagoras teaches.
He teaches that there are 360 of these.
360.
Some kind of geometry.
That guy was a freak for geometry.
I don't know, I don't know what he was doing.
Let's go to the next one.
Let's go to the next one.
And so what happens?
It's time, everybody, to get up and be happy, right?
Make happy, right?
Be agolic, right?
Be happy and do what?
Give him some glory.
A shout out, everybody,
because what's coming, says this text.
What's coming is the gammas of the arnillo.
Is the what?
Is the marriage of the fleece.
You didn't think we were making this stuff up fresh, did you?
Jesus is in the first Christ.
The first Christ creates the marriage of the fleece.
What do they do?
It's an actual operation.
We have it.
Some of our greatest minds from antiquity
recorded the operation.
It's a religious operation.
Yes.
You mean, beh.
No, sorry.
And you know what's funny is the Christians always got this
when you see like the marriage
and then try to symbolize there's a sheep.
What's the symbol?
No, it's the fleece.
And it was a process that was started by the first Christ,
the Medwa, the divine physician.
Yeah, late Bronze Age, right?
And so good.
You know what's on that fleece?
That fleece is guarded by a dragon
and on it is her song.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that gorgeous?
For you Christians tonight,
you walk into your churches tomorrow.
I know, I know you're gonna walk in there.
First thing you're gonna see is this giant dude
going through capital punishment.
That must not be a good start for the day.
Then they're gonna shove something in you
after they take something away from you.
They'll pass around a little potty
for you to your wallets to pee into.
I know you'll go and you can go tomorrow
for the first time having read the Bible.
I love it.
You see what kind of service I do
to the Christian community.
Do you see?
This is marvelous.
Give me the next one.
You know, I've got a couple of students, by the way,
who can read better than there.
Anyway, go ahead.
And I saw that heaven, that uranon.
I saw it opened up.
Okay, here we are.
The pharmaquia has kicked in, right?
And what do we see in just like Jesus
when he's with John, the Baptist, right?
And the water, right?
What does he see?
He sees that uranos open.
Here it comes.
And what comes out?
Oh God, are you ready?
Here's the portal people.
And evangelicals start salivating.
I saw a white horse.
And I saw the one sitting upon it.
And he's called Pistos Cae Alethinos.
He's called trustworthy and true.
And in righteousness, he judges
and he takes us all to war.
Oh God, this is a new Jesus.
I didn't see this Jesus coming.
I thought he was all like crucified.
I thought he was all wigged out
on whatever it was that he OD'd on.
That's what I thought.
He's yelling, I'm not a child trafficker.
I think he thought he was gonna go up
on some kind of Rico charges or something.
I don't know.
But the fact is, you know, he's dead.
Not here, right?
Right, not here.
Not here.
And this is what we all look for.
I know you do.
Those of you who love Jesus,
I know you're looking for this.
I know you're looking for this.
And Satanic congregation,
this is what you should be giving to people.
They wanna see Jesus.
Give them Jesus.
Let's see Jesus.
Let's see Jesus.
Go to that.
Here, look, Bible scholars can't do this.
Watch that.
What about Jesus?
What's going on with Jesus?
Well, his eyes are the flocks puros.
They have what?
They have the flocks puros.
They have the flocks puros.
That's a technical term.
What is that flocks?
You know what that flocks is?
It is that brilliance that you get
when the lightning strikes.
It is that silvery brilliance that hits right away.
Boom.
It's the first wave.
Boom, and you get the lightning, right?
Oh, God.
Oh, God, it takes forever for the thunder.
But that first brilliance, that is the flocks.
And you only get that when you've been Christed,
when you've been Christed,
when you have had that burning purple put into your eyes,
when your eyes are opened and you have the fruit.
Yeah.
Do you know what revealing the mystery does?
This is what they said in antiquity.
Revealing the mystery brings the lightning.
Yeah.
It makes the Christ.
Love it, love it, love it.
People were just asking me.
So Christ is a word that is a pharmaceutical term?
Yes, oh my God.
Why didn't you know that, Dan?
Why didn't you know that, Kip?
Why didn't you guys know that?
The people who are getting millions,
hundreds of thousands and millions of views
for their esoteric investigations.
Here you go, people.
You didn't know that because you don't work with the original.
It's obvious.
You can watch your garbage and say,
this is kind of laughable.
That's why classes don't mess around with the Bible.
That's why they don't.
Because it's this group of people who are laughably bad.
Who have assumed guardianship.
It's time for us people.
Devil told me, he was like, look at them.
There's a couple of things we can do.
I was like, okay, give me the options.
He said, you can either kick down that door
and take that book back.
Or you can let this corruption feed the wrath
that I'll take out on you for dishonoring the muse.
Cause it's his daughter.
You know what I mean?
I just, I don't mean to jump to the conclusion,
but it's kind of important to him, right?
That whole eye-opening thing and everything.
So I was like, fine, we'll take back the book.
Here's the book.
Let's show them the book.
Give me more Jesus, please.
Please, more Jesus.
This is to shock and nauseate you.
Yes, I love those pictures.
Love them.
Love them.
That one I didn't, flocks, pull it off.
Here it is.
Next one.
This I just wanted you to see.
Look at people, relish it a little bit.
Put your hands on this word.
Reach out, look at that first letter.
Oh, look at that fee.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Seminarians will say five,
but that's because, you know, they want foe and thumb.
Flocks, look at the flocks.
Look at that C.
That thing is bumpy too.
It's curvy, curvaceous, pull-offs.
Listen to that.
Pull-offs.
Love it.
Love it.
You can see it this time.
Greek is losing its musicality.
Yeah, it is.
It is.
You'd never see this particular combination.
You know what I mean?
In an eschelian chorus.
My God, man.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Dan, suck it.
Let's go.
All right.
Look at this.
What is he dressed in?
What's Jesus dressed in now?
For by the way, and I learned that the prophet Jesus
is more spoken of in the Quran than any other prophet,
any other prophet.
So here he is, everybody that respects Jesus.
Let's see.
Let's see what Jesus is wearing.
Cover up his wonderful thigh with that tattoo.
And let's look at what he's wearing.
What is he wrapped in?
He's wrapped in a Himmation
that is bevamin on Haimati.
That's what?
That is dyed in blood.
Died in blood.
Now, wait a minute.
This is not splashed in blood.
This is intentional.
This is taking a garment
and dying it.
Making sure it's baptized, thoroughly baptized.
Yeah, bring that dye out.
What is it that they're using?
Pray tell Jesus, what's on your threads, gangsta G?
It's blood.
It's blood.
It's blood.
What do you think all those children were for?
Right?
Remember what the muse of the Vatican said,
the Vatican prophetess.
Remember what she said.
This is all.
Analogia.
Analogia.
That is what this is.
That is what is bringing you the quantum reality.
Good, good.
You hear it?
Oh, God.
Okay, I'm getting excited
because this starts to get really good.
Give me the next one.
Whatever the next one was, just feed it to me.
I've lost, oh, oh, here it is.
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.
Oh, you gotta give it to me quick.
What?
So Jesus has his threads that are staying with blood, right?
And what is he gonna do when he comes back?
What is he gonna do when this is him?
Tell us, Jesus, what's the night out on the town gonna be?
He says, I'm gonna open my mouth
and I'm gonna kill with my tongue.
Oh, oh, there's my superhero.
There is my superhero.
This guy's power, a sword comes out of his mouth
right through your chest.
It's his voice, he kills with his voice, yeah.
Yeah, what do you think that thing's already covered
with blood for?
Because, you know, when you're out and you get spattered,
you know, it's not a cool look.
You know, this is Jesus we're talking about.
This is Jesus.
Now remember, 30% of your population follows this Jesus.
Yeah, and they've picked their prophet, orange Jesus.
They picked their prophet and you have them.
Tom said you should sacrifice him to the tree of liberty.
But if you won't listen to Tom,
you don't deserve your democracy
because Tom was pulling it right out
of those classical sources.
Fantastic, the same ones that we use
to be able to read these texts.
That's what I'm bringing to you, that benefit.
So listen to this, it's to be loyal.
It's a good old fashioned Tom, love it, love it.
This is fantastic, I'm privileged, I told you.
This is my greatest privilege.
Yep, let's give them, give them what they want.
Oh, that was down there at the bottom.
We need the text before that, text before that.
Yeah, and look what he says at the bottom.
What does he call himself here at the bottom?
Look at the last line, Panto Kratos, right?
He's the, oh, and oh, God, I almost didn't say it.
He says he's gonna shepherd the people
and how's he gonna do it?
He's gonna do it with an iron robdon.
Now, you don't know what a robdon is,
especially if you're a Bible scholar
because all you read is one text
that's already been translated.
Let's be honest, none of you actually translate.
I know, I used to teach in seminary
and I took their programs through the roof.
Love it, beautifully, hugely successful.
Why?
Because I actually taught them how to read the text
and we read texts together.
I didn't leave them with anything that was one,
here, we're gonna spend the next two years on John 316.
We also looked at some tragedy and,
so a lot of different history stuff.
Love it, love it.
They loved it too, man.
I bet they're using it to this day.
You go, you go, gentlemen, you go.
All right, fantastic.
Let's get to the next one.
Here we go.
Look, he's gonna shepherd people with the robdon
and that's the thing that Bacchus carries around.
That's the thing that Bacchus carries around
and you're gonna say, Dan, that nothing here, right?
Nothing here shows any connection between Christianity
and anything pagan, anything pagan,
especially not the Resurrection Festival, right?
That couldn't be, that couldn't be pagan
because Jesus, he's an original gangster, gee, he's original.
Yeah, yeah, robdon, Dan, it's a rod.
It's the same one that the Septuagint says
that Moses is carrying that turns into a serpent,
just like the Egyptians.
Just like the Egyptians.
Now, you don't think, Dan, that this is actually,
that this is actually Bacchus.
That Jesus is just doing things that Bacchus does.
Well, let's keep reading the verse, Dan.
What's this say?
Dan, I know you're like, oh, quick, you can't,
you're looking up, Dan.
I know, I know, your vocabulary sucks, Dan.
I know it does.
Let's go.
Right?
Who's Dan, by the way?
Dan is your ordinary evangelical know-it-all.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, let's not say, let's not limit it
to the evangelicals because this is just the,
this is the guy of faith.
Dan is the guy of faith and he's proud.
Dan is proud because he went to the Bible Institute.
You know, he's probably,
probably sat on some committee or something.
Right?
He's got a thing on his wall that says,
I am a Bible scholar.
Right?
Okay, Dan, put down, it's, you can say, Dan,
to all the Dan's of the world.
You say you read Greek and I know for a friggin' fact
you don't.
Let's go to the next one.
Read this up, read this up.
Look, bring it up, blow it up.
Oh my God, yeah, so he uses that rabdon, right?
Same thing that Moses got, but ready for Bacchus.
What else does he do?
He does the action of walking on the grapes in the press.
He's the one who brings that wine from the press.
It's the wine of what?
It's the wine of the orge of God.
It's that wine of that wrath of God.
Who do you think brings that?
Who do you think?
Why is Jesus using the wine treading?
Everybody knows Bacchus walks around with the rabdon.
Right?
Everybody knows that Bacchus is carrying around snakes.
When Jesus is walking around saying you lift up snakes,
it's not because he's trying to be Bacchus.
It's because his cult is Bacchic.
Congratulations.
You just saw Jesus for who he is, Dan.
Yeah, you can squint real hard if you try.
It's not gonna help.
Let's go to the next one.
Oh, read this one.
He's also the Ponto Crattor, right?
Yeah, it's a title they used of Hermes for hundreds of years.
So let's see the messenger.
Why is he invoking a messenger here?
What good is that?
Keep going.
Oh, I saw an ongelon.
Right, you forgot.
We're all at the party, right?
We just took the drugs at the party, right?
And what are we seeing now?
The ongelon.
The ongelon.
Remember, it's because of our pharmaquia
that this is all, you know, he wants to take it away.
Long story short, Yahu doesn't want you to have the drugs.
Long story short, yeah.
And it turns out the best one comes from Lady Babylon.
Yeah, yeah, he doesn't want you to have it.
The devil, the devil's got mojo.
He knows how to make that garden work.
So he wants you to have it.
He wants you to know that that liar,
you mean God can lie?
Yes, the very first lie in the Bible is by God.
Yeah, amazing.
Devil's like that lie in sack.
He tells you, kill you if he ate it.
No, there's a way your eyes will be open.
Yeah, he'd be just like him.
And he knows that that was the devil, devil's mojo.
Here we go, give me the next one.
Oh God, and what that angel say?
What now, look people, are you ready?
Okay, for those of you with ears to the ear, tune in.
Make sure you're on the throne.
Are you ready?
And I saw one angel standing in the sun.
And he shouted in a great voice,
saying to all the birds of the air,
pay attention, come to the banquet.
Of God.
Okay, come to the banquet, he's saying to the birds.
Now wait, did you hear it?
You're augurs out there.
Those of you who are augurs out there, did you hear it?
Did you see the birds flying around?
Do you understand the signs?
Yeah, yeah.
Then you'll be able to comprehend what is happening.
Listen to the speech.
The speech is agurial.
Yeah, he's telling those birds, time to come to the feast.
Are you ready?
Are you ready people for the feast?
What are we gonna get from this feast of God?
We get to have the marriage.
We get to have the marriage on the face.
And we get to have, what else?
What else do we get to have?
A feast people, a feast.
What are we gonna feast on?
Everybody, all you Jesus loving people.
We'd love you Jesus, hail Jesus, all of you.
He touched me, oh, he touched me, he touched me.
Are you ready for his feast?
I got just a hint of Michael Jackson there.
Did anybody else?
Let's go.
What's at the feast of Jesus?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
It's the next one.
It's the next one.
Okay, are you ready?
You're gonna eat something.
You're gonna eat flesh, baby.
Flash, you know what Jesus has in his great banquets?
He's got the flesh of kings.
You get to eat Putin's butt roast.
Isn't that gonna be cool?
Isn't that gonna be cool?
What else?
The flesh of leaders.
Leaders, military leaders, social leaders, civic leaders.
You get to, you get their flesh.
You get their flesh, you know everybody.
Come on, you know you're getting revved up
and hungry for the flesh.
You want a little Biden hoagie, don't you?
You want a little Biden hoagie, don't you?
Well, you know what else you get?
You can eat some generals, too, and you can eat the strong.
Isn't that great, the strong?
Jesus is gonna give you a banquet.
You mean when Jesus comes back,
he's gonna serve a banquet,
and that banquet is gonna have cold cuts of people?
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
And now you know why the Romans
said they're gonna be the end of us.
This cult will be the end of us, right?
Didn't you wonder why the Romans,
they don't care what your religion is.
They don't care.
It's when you revolt.
It's when you try to tear down the government.
Something Thomas Jefferson says happens every 100
to 150 years, which is right about now.
The only solution is the blood of the tyrant,
poured out to liberty.
That's the only solution.
If you won't accept the voice of the people,
the people will shed your blood for liberty.
Yes, when we speak, when our vote is heard, yeah.
Then we know, then we know.
No tyrants.
There'd be no tyrants overthrowing governments, right?
Sorry, it's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.
No, no.
Not on your watch.
Yeah, love it.
Love this.
Prophetic, you wanted some prophetic stuff, right?
But look, people, you know what I'm doing.
Everybody here is a total nerd.
You know what I'm doing.
All I'm doing is taking those historical patterns
and giving them back to you, right?
Showing us how that we bounce.
That's all, you can do it with just studying history.
It's why it's so good to study history.
You can tell what's gonna happen.
Yeah, lovely.
You'd think that this is why the prophecies are so important
because they can tell you based on what they have seen.
This is the likely outcome.
Oh God, I love it, I love it.
Oracular wisdom, it's fantastic.
Give us that next one.
Okay, people don't have time.
Look, they're like, look, it's been an hour.
When are you gonna call in Gnostic?
Look, why am I doing all this for you, this banquet?
So you can eat flesh.
Remember, this is the same God who wants you
to drink his blood and eat his flesh.
Smash the babies on the ground, right?
What's your reward?
You get to eat more flesh.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Oh, there we go.
And I saw a Therion.
I saw a Therion, I saw that beast.
Yup, and the kings of the earth and the armies
of the earth all gathered together to make war
with the one who sits on a horse, good in his army.
We got a nice war going, people.
And I can promise you slaughter.
I can promise you slaughter.
This is what everybody who loves Jesus knows
is going to happen, right?
They're waiting for,
why do you think they're not gun shy, right?
They're ready to get this stuff started.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's fulfill this prophecy, right?
It's what they want.
Let's go.
Next one.
Boom.
And what happened?
Now, this is the most important thing I've said all night.
Are you ready?
Look at the third and fourth words in here.
To Therion.
To Therion, that's what's traditionally translated
as beast, is beast, right?
Now, you and I have been studying Theriacs
and we're gonna see a Theriac come out
out of the Herculaneum Library, right?
You and I have been looking at these Theriacs
and we know, we know what that Therion is.
They're calling it a beast, but you and I speak
and we know that the throne,
we know what the throne really is, right?
And we know what the beast really is.
But it's more than that.
This is not just Orphic Vox here that's working.
It's more a technical use of the term.
The Therion is a technical use of the term, right?
What is a Therion, right?
What is that Theriac?
You gotta start reading the Greek priests, right?
The Roman physicians who are writing
about these compound formulas and what they're doing, right?
So what does this line say?
Look, the verb is epiosthe.
The Therion is uncovered.
The Therion is discovered.
It doesn't say something about a brrr.
It says at this time, the Theriac is uncovered.
Look at the next, just so they can see it,
straight out of the Victorians.
Something that is determined, right?
The Theriac is unveiled.
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Because once we have the Theriac, we've got the beast.
And what does the beast hold up?
As you all know in St. Danick congregation,
she who has the cup.
Yeah, fantastic.
You cannot take these compound poisons of communion
that allow you to enter death
unless you also have a Theriac with it,
unless you're carried by the beast.
That's how it works.
Look, here, here at Amonkor,
we're going to send you there and back.
You are explorers.
You're going to go there.
And where is there?
There is beyond the dark star.
You'll come back and you'll fill us in.
You'll then know what is beyond.
And you won't fear death anymore.
Yeah, isn't that nice?
It's a side effect of this whole process.
So welcome to Amonkor.
Yes, fantastic.
Flights are departing.
Yes, fantastic.
Let's go. Next one.
Look, let's blow them.
Just blow it, Chewie.
We need the big explosives here.
Look at this.
Oh, yeah, wow.
The charagma.
What is the charagma?
Yeah, it's that thing that's punched into our skin.
You mean these people are into this?
Yes, okay.
The tattooing is there for a reason.
Why? Because he is the logos.
He is the logos.
Everybody runs around and Mark of the Beast.
Mark of the Beast.
Did you know Moses was handing out the Mark of the Beast?
And by the way, Moses, the oldest word for muse,
is mew omega sigma, Mosos.
It's the same word as Moses, right?
It's the same word as Moses.
And Moses, we all have the char...
Look, I want to correct.
I want to show you something that is fake tonight,
and a real part of your reality, but it's fake.
Moses, trying to help the people who are getting bitten
by the snakes.
What's the thing that you got to do for their health?
You got to make an image of a serpent, a bronze serpent,
and you're going to have to put it on a pole and hold it up.
When everybody looks at it, magical, magical,
they're going to be healed.
Now, for those of you who believe that's possible,
I've got salvation to sell you.
Yeah, but what's the reality anthropologically?
It doesn't say that.
That bronze serpent, it says you put it into a tattoo
so that the person can look at it and be reassured
that their medicine is working.
Jesus, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Do you see how it is when you follow the fairy tale?
You don't know it.
Look at my arm.
You know what's written on that?
You have no idea who you are.
You have no idea.
Yeah, but it's OK.
It's OK because that awakening, that self-knowledge,
that's better than any sort of doctrine or dogma
or list of things to do while you watch some dude hang there.
Yeah, it's more powerful.
It's love, baby.
You don't need a credit card for this stuff.
Let's go.
Next one, let's be almost done because we
have to bring in Gnostic.
He's like, hurry the hell up.
Yeah, so this is just the, I just
wanted you to see the, everybody else gets killed.
End of story, right?
Jesus with his mouth deaf, right?
Imagine that.
Imagine, hey, everybody out there doing all the movies,
Marvel and all that kind of stuff, make this superhero.
Make it every time he opens his mouth,
a giant sword comes out and stabs you through the chest
or through the face or through the neck, right?
This is Mr. Blood.
He got to cover him with blood because it's, you know,
he's going to get covered with it, doing this kind of stuff.
Just out it comes.
That's the God that you people follow.
The watchers are watching and they're like, what?
Are you kidding me?
Dang.
Yeah, there's no great mother here, definitely.
Definitely, great mother wouldn't let that happen.
She'd be like, cut that out, kid.
All right, go to the next one.
And look, look, look, look.
I just want you guys to know that there's hope
because Satan will be released, this says.
Yeah, his time is going to come up
and he's going to be released.
He's going to be released.
Fantastic.
Who would do such a thing?
I bet God could be convinced to do that.
You know what I mean?
It's like, dude, you messed up the garden.
Why not go for it again?
Let's go, let's go.
What happens?
The devil is the one who causes them to wander.
Look at that, that word that is four and five and plan on.
Right?
Oh, get your participles out, right?
Oh God, this is lovely.
What is somebody doing who's plan on?
They're wandering.
They're wandering.
So when the daughters go out to celebrate Bakas
and daddy says, hey, wise guy,
my girls went out to celebrate Bakas
and they are still nuts.
They are still nuts and what are they doing, dad?
They're wandering up in the mountains.
They're like breastfeeding animals,
making like choruses and lots of singing going on,
stuff like that, but they're wandering.
They're outside.
You know who made this?
You know who the author of this wandering is?
In your own texts,
Satan, the Saturnian Bakic religion
was started in the Bronze Age.
And by this time that these texts are there,
it's the core.
Dan, I'm sorry, but the plain fact of the matter is
Christianity is pagan mystery.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a corruption, Dan.
Your religion, whether you're a Protestant or a Catholic
or a Mormon or who else?
Joe was witnesses.
They're offshoots.
Your religion is from a God who was arrested
in a public park with a naked boy.
That's the anthropological reality.
Let's go to the next one.
And he was doing pagan stuff.
He was doing pagan stuff with that naked kid.
Sorry, but that's the historical reality.
Okay.
And so here's the devil and he's causing them to wander,
but look what happens.
You know where the devil goes?
The devil goes to the Limne in Tupuros, Caithiu.
Where does he go?
He goes to that container,
to that container of fire and sulfur, fire and sulfur.
Now, why would you say such a thing?
All of you who've been watching and dedicating your time
for so long recognize now what that sulfur is.
He's talking about a purification.
What are we gonna find in that container of fire?
Are you gonna find the devil in there?
You're gonna find Saturn.
Yeah.
And what else?
What else?
Give me the text again.
What else are we gonna find?
Oh, God.
In addition to that sulfur, that puritive sulfur,
this is where the text says that ferriac
and the pseudo-profit are tried.
Yes, that's where they operate.
You wanna be the pseudo-profit?
Isidore, shut up.
That was saying Isidore's buttocks.
And I'm whipping him because he said
the Antichrist is ominous.
Yeah, you dirty old man.
Let's go to the next one.
This is who we're talking about.
Where is he?
He's in that container of fire.
You can, I can guarantee you what's in his eyes.
Oh, love it.
Okay, let's keep going.
Do you think we would get to him?
Here he is.
Here he is, people.
Is this a Hebrew word?
No, it's not.
It's not.
Not at all, people.
It's a perfectly nice Greek word.
Just like Jerusalem is.
I'm gonna give you a gift tonight.
Satanic congregation, this is for you.
This is our toy in our cereal box.
They used to do that.
This is our toy.
Are you ready?
Jerusalem.
What does Jerusalem mean?
It's a Greek word.
It's based on two roots.
And it means holy-minded.
Holy-minded.
Isn't that a pretty name for a city?
I wanna go to the place called holy-minded.
Yeah.
The stuff that comes later,
the stuff that comes after developed by rabbis,
that tradition, etymologically, is bull.
It's terrible, right?
Their own etymologies.
And they'll scratch their head.
Maybe it's their mech.
Well, maybe it's Shugal's a gaze way over in Samaria.
Maybe he came up with it.
They're geniuses.
No, I don't know, people.
It's calcolithic, right?
Oh, God.
Why did they not think about this?
Thank you to the archeologists from Tel Aviv
who will say openly that there's no,
there's no evidence to support any of this.
Yeah, it's a fairy tale that was invented
in the third century.
Isn't that amazing?
How would you like to know that, right?
Wow, your entire world of being
is based upon an invention.
And it's an invention that tells you
it's okay to kill, to take a baby and smash its head
against the ground or blow it up.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Where do we stand?
Where does Satan stand?
You're not gonna see him dressed in blood.
You're not gonna see Satan with a sword mouth
like a friggin' alien.
You're not gonna see that.
No, no, Saturnian, the Saturnian age was golden age, right?
Plainly and openly recognized as a golden age.
This is civilization, people.
This is what the library at Herculaneum will bring us.
It'll open our eyes.
It'll open our eyes and we will wake up
from the nightmare that is Judeo-Christian heritage.
We'll wake up from that.
We'll be free out of manateen freedom
all from the Logos.
Isn't that beautiful?
I love it.
Okay, I'll stop, I'll stop
because I'm glorying over the future.
I wanna give you a couple more
than I want Neil to be able to come in.
Thanks for hanging in there, Neil.
I just wanted you to see Hades, right?
For those of you who think you've read the Bible and haven't,
look at the first line.
You're gonna see the name for the God of the underworld
in there and another name for another God, Thanatos.
These are both gods that are used within the Orphic mystery
that your Christianity is entirely based on, Dan,
entirely based on.
Fantastic.
Keep going, keep going.
I wanna rush through these.
I think we're done.
Yeah, well, here's one and here's another.
Give me another one.
Look at this.
Make love to this Greek people.
Look at this.
This is several ways, Hades, right?
They have that form, Hades, right?
Where it becomes like a diphthong.
Yeah, oh God, love it.
Look, they capitalize it, right?
Because even your text editors know who this person is.
So for those of you who believe in Jesus,
you believe also in Hades, Hades, right?
Hades, fantastic, fantastic.
Let's go.
Let's go to the next one.
And they still have the guts, Chewy.
They still have the guts to stand there and say,
Easter has nothing to do with it.
Yeah, okay.
Christianity.
What do you think, man?
Come on, man, it's not.
Okay, I wanna leave us with words of Cassandra, right?
She says, oh my God, what is this terrible thing I see?
What is this net of Hades?
What is this net of Hades?
What is this hunter's equipment?
Of the one who shares your bed?
What is this?
Ooh, I'm starting to get, it's a little bit sexy, right?
Right, what is this huntress of death?
You know, let those who are unsatisfying,
you know that pack?
Let the pack, this is what he's saying.
Let the pack that is unsatisfied, think of those dogs.
Think of those dogs that never stop thirsting for blood.
Right, right?
Let them hallelujah their way in here
underneath the curse.
Oh, let them hallelujah themselves.
Yeah, look at that first word on the last line.
That's where your concept of hallelujah comes from.
It's a shout.
It's a shout of a deathbringer.
Yeah, we're with Diana tonight.
And tonight we're hunting.
We're with Lucifer.
And we're here to expose the one that kills children.
Do you know who shows up when you try to kill a child?
Diana the Kurotrofos does.
The child nurse, she's the one who shows up
and she rescues that child.
And that child enters her service.
Isn't that gorgeous?
That's what that idiot Agamemnon ended up doing.
Yeah, gonna sacrifice his daughter.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
These are the gods that are in your text
for those of you who think you've read the Bible, but haven't.
And let's go down to here.
I just wanted people to see really quick.
This is an Eremorff.
We're talking about a second line.
This is Hera Pombasilia,
that whole Lord of Lord, King of Kings.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
That is all based upon this figure.
Nice to meet everybody.
Meet the Sulectron Dios.
Yeah, what is that?
Yeah, the one who maintains that union of God.
Meet her, who is she?
She's the all queen.
The all queen, the Pombasilia.
She is queen of queens.
What is Jesus doing?
He is being abackened,
but he is appropriating to himself her title,
the first Christ, her title.
Were you there at the Gamos?
Did you see it?
Did you see God and his Gamos?
Fantastic.
You've been to the ceremony of the fleece,
and you know now who the Christ is.
Keep going, last one.
And I just want you to see,
because everybody loves that messenger Hermes, right?
And that's why Jesus is dragging him in in the end, right?
Why?
Why?
Because look at the bottom line.
Look at the very last word.
This panto crator,
this almighty is the prophet of the Logos.
You see the word log there?
He is the prophet of the Logos.
Okay, we're set.
You can look right through Jesus,
and you can look right inside of them
and see what his core is tonight.
I love it.
Thank you for coming.
Now, we're gonna bring on,
we're gonna bring on Gnostic informant.
I'm gonna let him do his thing.
You get a double scoop tonight.
You get a double cone.
I'm gonna go outside and finish eating my cone.
Here's Neil,
and he is gonna give us that Gnostic power.
I mean, and he's in a fight and moved tonight.
So Neil, I'm turning it over to you.
What do you have for Satanic congregation?
Well, this is Hilaria Festival Week.
And Hilaria, if we look at what Ovid says,
Hilaria leads right into the next festival,
which is also dedicated to the great mother.
It's called the Megalicia.
And you have two major great mother festivals back to back.
One of them leading up until the month of April.
One of them starting the month of April.
By the way, April, what is April?
It comes from Aphrodite, Venus.
She is the mother.
She is the spring goddess, the dawn goddess.
There's a reason why Iostre in the Germanic religion,
or whatever, Pantheon, is the same month, Friday.
Freya's day, they call it,
in those Anglo-Saxons,
when they're copying the Romans, obviously.
Everything's based off Roman stuff, Roman stuff.
They're just personalizing it.
Well, that's Venus' day in the Latin weeks coming up.
So just keep that in mind.
Venus, Dawnstar, Luciferia, you know, the spring goddess.
There's a reason why this all lines up like that.
So don't let anyone tell you that.
We don't know anything about Iostre.
All we know is bead wrote one thing.
We don't know anything about it.
No, that's not true.
There's over 150 inscriptions of the dawn goddess
in that region predating bead.
I'll show that tomorrow when I go live on my channel.
But I wanna talk about what Amon was saying.
He made a good point and I agree with him.
New Testament scholarship is in the wrong hands.
New Testament scholarship needs to go,
well, first of all,
they need to just eradicate the entire field
and give it over to the classicists.
Their Greek text, the Greeks,
people who understand Greek literature
will understand the New Testament better.
What they have now is they have these people
go to seminarians, go to seminary,
learn Hebrew, a little bit of Hebrew,
and then take that as if that's gonna
make you understand the New Testament.
Now, some of the sources that I brought Amon touchdown
right before he, I even got here,
but let me, if you let me go to my screen.
First thing I wanted to talk about was,
their classicists wrote some shit in the late first century,
or early second century,
about Jerusalem and where the Jews come from.
And here's what he says.
This is pretty interesting.
He says, some say the Jews
refuted us from the island of Crete,
who settled on the nearest coast of Africa
about the time when Saturn was driven from his throne
by the power of Jupiter.
Evidence of this is sought in the name.
There is a famous mountain in Crete called Aida,
the neighboring tribe, the Aidea,
came to be called Judea
by a barbarous lengthening of the national name.
Others assert that in the reign of ISIS
by the overflowing population of Egypt,
led by Hiro Shlemus,
holy minded and Judas,
discharge itself in the neighboring countries.
So that is a Greek name, by the way.
And I just wanted to pull this up
to like add to what you were saying.
By the way, when people thought for centuries and centuries,
people thought that this was bullocks.
But then archeology came along
and found out that the whole Philistine country
was all Greek.
So the whole Cretan-Palestinian chalcolithic theory
turned out to be spot on.
Any thoughts on that, Amon, before I go to the next one?
Hey, amazing kudos to sources.
Look what Neil is doing, by the way, everyone,
because all the Danes out there in the world,
they can't do this, right?
They can't, they don't want to use these sources
because the sources show them for what they are.
So it's better to stay in a vacuum.
So kudos, Neil.
Thank you, Tacitus, love you, Tacitus.
Oh, kisses the Tacitus, go.
No, this was the source that I wanted to bring
that you were touching on.
Now, if you read Revelation through the lens
of someone who knows just Hebrew and not Greek,
this was gonna make no sense at all.
It says,
k'edokan et talasah tus necrus,
and the sea gave up the dead.
And then it says over here,
kai othenatos, kai ohades,
tus edokan tus necrus,
and Hades gave up,
and Thanatos gave up their dead.
Now, all three of those are Greek gods
that have hymns dedicated to them in the Orphic hymns.
So if this was given to a classicist,
they would be like, oh, I know exactly what's going on here.
Thades, Thanatos, Thalasah, they're giving up their dead,
or some sort of battle going on
between Thades, Thanatos, and Thalasah,
and what I would say is Sebasius.
Now, you mentioned, you got the wine press,
the lanon of Orge.
Now, if you're a classicist, you know exactly what that is.
The wine press festival of Greece is called...
It's called the...
The lanane.
Lananeo, yeah, yeah, Lananeo.
Sorry, I had a break.
It's the same word.
They have a festival called that,
and this what they do there, Orge.
They perform the Orge.
That language lines up, it's very Bacchic,
but it's also very Sebasian,
because he's called the Pontocratore.
He's called Hoopsistos.
These are all titles that Sebasius gets.
And by the way, before you say,
but that's all Greek, and this is all Jewish.
John, the author of Revelation, is telling you
he's writing to this, to seven churches in Asia.
Asia Minor, Anatolia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, Greek.
Guess who's worshipped there?
Guess who's the highest God in all of the land of Phrygia,
besides the great mother.
It's Sebasius, who's called Hoopsistos,
and Pontocratore.
So it all lines up through the eyes of a classicist.
None of this makes any sense
if you're looking at like Ugaritic texts or Hebrew stuff.
This doesn't make any sense at all.
This is completely different than that.
Now, can I just emphasize,
can I just emphasize what a strong point that you just made.
You gave two different perspectives,
and the one of the people chasing the Ugaritic
and Gilgamesh's hairy friend around there,
are like, right?
Yeah, they're not going to be able to use the evidence
that Neil is just pummeling.
This is pummeling, Neil.
I love it, keep going.
Yeah, we're in Asia Minor,
seven churches of Asia Minor, all Greek cities.
This is our area that is widely known,
heavy Sebasius worship.
Sebasius is a dual nature God.
If you read about him through Diodorus,
Sebasius is both Zeus and Dionysus rolled into one.
He's the father and son.
You have a father, son, Godhead,
way before Christianity.
And then it exists in Sebasius.
So, John, the author of Revelation,
also wrote the Gospel of John.
According to most people who agree
that it's the same author, I think it is.
So, especially when you start reading John,
and it's just Greek concept after Greek concept
after Greek concept.
Who's Jesus' beloved?
What kind of concept?
That's a very Greek thing to have their own beloved,
or to be someone else's beloved.
And you pass on the tradition.
This is sort of thing going on in ancient Greece.
Well, I got a source that I want to show you.
Do you want to pull up my source right there?
John 15.1, here's what it says.
Ego, eimi, e ampalos, e elecine.
I am ampalos the true.
I am the true vine.
Caio pater mu, or gerigost.
And my father is the vine dresser.
What the hell does that mean?
Well, if you're not a classist, you probably like that.
Just, what?
Jesus is just saying I'm a vine.
It's poetic, who cares?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is a specific Bacchic title.
Ready for this?
Here we go.
Ampalos.
Ampalos was the personification of the grapevine
and lover of Dionysus.
There they are right there.
Bacchus and Ampalos.
This is the same gospel where Jesus and his beloved
are together at the table, loving each other,
like Ampalos and Bacchus.
Everything lines up.
When he calls himself the Ampalos,
he's saying, I am the lover of Dionysus.
And my father is the vine dresser.
And you pass that tradition on.
And then John becomes his Ampalos.
And then John picks another Ampalos.
And it's beloved to beloved to beloved.
This is the Greek, this is the ancient Greek world
as we know it.
And anyone, any classist will say amen to that.
That's a fact.
But if you don't know Greek, you wouldn't be like,
this makes no sense.
You just, oh, it's just poetic.
Okay, who knows?
Nice, nice, nice source right there.
I love that.
So I just want people to understand this.
There's a language being portrayed in these texts
that someone who doesn't understand the context
of the ancient Greek world would make this.
They're just gonna go right past their head.
And that's why you get these Christian scholars today
when people are like, well, isn't this the season
for Halaria Festival where Addis is resurrected?
And how about the Serapia for Osiris
and the great Dionysia and Athens
where they celebrate the dismemberment of Zagreus
and resurrection of Dionysus
or the Adonia Festival over in Syria
where the women would get on roofs and mourn
and richly mourn and sing hymns that were written by Sappho,
richly mourning the death of Adonis
and then rejoicing as resurrection three days
roughly within a couple of three-day period
similar to the Gospels
whereas in the Gospels, two women show up to his tomb
the same way as Osiris where Isis and Nephthys show up
to his tomb and take his body parts
and put them together and he resurrects.
All of this stuff lines up.
If you're a classicist reads this stuff and goes,
oh, this is all just checks out.
This is just another telling of this sacred myth
that's been told for centuries since the Bronze Age.
Okay, okay, now I wanna ask you,
why do you think it is that smug biblical scholars
seem to miss the boat so much?
How, is it just, I'm gonna say, look,
it's because they're under-trained, right?
And it's by design because they are run by mostly the church.
The Christian academic world is a Christian-based,
most of their students are Christian,
most of the professors are Christian.
Brutes Metzger, the guy that taught Bart Ehrman
was a fundamentalist basically
and he's teaching, he's writing books on biblical Greek
and just focus on the New Testament Greek,
don't look anywhere else, just go like this.
That's how they're trained.
They're trained to have a knee-jerk reaction
to the term dying and rising God.
If you say that, oh, no, no, no, that's a bad term.
Oh, I was told that James Frazier is no good.
I was told that Thomas Paine is no good.
I was told that the German philologists are all no good.
The English folklorists are all no good.
All of those fucking scholars from the 19th and 20th century
were running circles around what's going on today,
in my opinion.
And they've been doing this ever since the beginning
because Afrikanas was giving Origen a hard time.
I think it was Origen, giving him a hard time about,
well, do we even know what the word for tree is in Hebrew
or do they not have that much in?
Origen was like, yeah, they don't have a lot.
So these texts you have could be Greek originals, right?
It's not coming from the Hebrew,
but what do we do about it, right?
I mean, they're even excusing this stuff back then
to maintain their own appropriated picture
because of Jesus and everything associated with him.
It's just the corruption of a Greek mystery.
Wow, suddenly, you know, I don't know.
What is she, they need Christianity to stay pure.
So they need it to be in its own bubble by itself.
That's why it's scholarship is separated from the rest.
You don't separate Roman religion from Greek religion.
Classes have studied both together.
They're looking at the interconnectedness
between the Romans and the Greeks.
Same with the Egyptians, you know what I mean?
And yeah, you have Egyptology, you don't get me wrong.
You have different subfields,
but they're all looking at the same basis of evidence
and drawing from each other.
New Testament scholarship is the only little special
needs like area where they're just by themselves,
just chilling as if that's like something
that makes sense, doesn't.
I have one more source that I want to read.
I think this is pretty interesting to end up on.
So if you want to pull my screen up real quick.
Now this is from Livy.
Now he talks about Numa.
King Numa, one of the only kings that ever ruled Rome.
They stopped the kingdom and went into a republic
for 200 plus years before they were an empire.
This was what happened to Rome.
But he sets up the religious institution.
This is an interesting story.
Ovid seems to be on par with what he says here.
So he talks about how,
I'm just gonna skip ahead a little bit.
He says, first of all, he divided the year into 12 months.
Wait, what did you say here?
Yeah, okay, he makes a pointing for each deity,
his own special priest.
First of all, he divided the year into 12 months,
corresponding to the moon's revolutions.
But as the moon does not complete 30 days in each month,
and so there are fewer days in the lunar year
than it imagined in the course of the sun.
He interplayed it into cleric months,
and so he arranged them that every 20th year,
the days should coincide with the same position of the sun.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Here's what he says next.
This is the part that I wanted to get to.
Next, he turned his attention to the appointment of priest.
He himself, however,
conducted a great many religious services,
especially those which belong to the flamen,
which is priest of Jupiter.
But he thought that in a war-like state,
there would be more kings of the type of Romulus
than of Numa, who would take the field in person
to guard therefore against the sacrificial rites,
which the king performed.
Being interrupted, he appointed a flamen
as perpetual priest to Jupiter,
and he ordered that he should wear a distinctive dress
and sit in the royal crewell chair.
He appointed two additional flamens,
one for Mars and one for Quarainus,
and also chose virgins as priestesses to Vesta.
This order of priestesses came into existence
originally in Alba,
and was connected with the race of the founder.
He assigned them a public stipend,
and that they might give their whole time to the temple
and made their persons sacred and inviolable
by a vow of chastity and the other religious sanctions.
Similarly, he chose 12 salliai for Mars,
leaping priests of salliai.
This is ancient stuff.
This goes back to Samuel Thrackey, if you know about that.
For Mars, gradivus, and assigned to them
the distinctive dress of embroidered tunic
and over it, bras and cures.
They were instructed to march
in solemn procession through the city,
carrying the 12 shields called the Ankelea,
and singing hymns accompanied by a solemn dance in triple time.
The next office to be filled
was that of the Pontifist Maximus, the high priest.
Numa appointed the son of Marcus, one of the senators,
Numa Marcius, and all the regulations bearing on religion
written out and sealed were placed in his charge.
Here was laid down with what victims and what days
and at what temples the various sacrifices
were to be offered, from what sources,
the expenses connected, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So you get this institution of the Vestal Virgins,
and a reason why I brought that up
is because these are the people who basically went
into the Sibylene oracles.
These are these sacred texts, the Sibyl,
the Sibylene books, and they would read these texts
and get oracles through them.
By the way, Christianity, and I put this in one
of my earlier videos recently,
it's called, they lied about the first 100 years
of Christianity, where I argue that the gospel text
and revelation and some of the early Christian stuff
seems to be coming out of the same genre
as the Sibylene oracles is.
Very similar where Nero is the 666, the Antichrist,
you get a lot of, there's a lot of overlap happening,
but in this text, they were told to go and get the mother,
great mother of Caibele from Phrygia,
bring her to Rome, and when they did that,
they ended, they were getting crushed by Hannibal
in 204 BCE, after they bring her over,
all of a sudden Hannibal is defeated,
but not only that, they take over the whole entire
Mediterranean within the next 50 years.
So that's where you get your religion from,
and this is where you get the institution of the holidays
that we're in right now.
The holiday that they set up was specifically set up,
it was a week long, where you have,
they bring out a tree, a pine tree that represents
the God Addis, and they lay it down and bury it,
as if they're burying a body,
and then they richly mourn for this God,
then they bring out the new initiates, the golly,
and these people were getting in the streets,
they were getting whipped, like in the gospels,
like Jesus carrying his cross,
and they're being whipped in the streets,
this is part of the initiation.
There's all this stuff lining up,
then there's a two-day period in between the day of mourning
and the day of rejoicing,
where they start to rejoice the resurrection of Addis.
If this was celebrated,
but they'd also performed this in Roman-occupied Egypt,
and you know the Egyptians, they love Osiris,
so they didn't make them worship Osiris,
they performed the same rites for Osiris.
That's a big deal, because now we're looking at,
we're looking at the gospels, and we're like,
is this just another sort of flip of this idea,
where you have the Adonia for Adonis,
you have in Eleusis, the Great Dionysia Festival,
same exact week, you can look this up.
The month's called Aleph Lebolia,
it's the month, it means like, it's a title of Artemis,
it means like Hunter, Artemis the Hunter, Aleph Lebolia.
And so during this exact same week,
they're performing plays in honor of the dismemberment
of Zagreus and resurrection of Dionysus.
There's so much lining up here,
during this day that we're on right now of Easter,
that the fact that Easter comes in this day,
and by the way, scholars will say,
this is the only thing we know for sure about Jesus,
everything else we don't know,
but the only thing we know for sure about his life
is that he went down to Jerusalem during the Passover.
How, how do you know that?
That's a coincidence, that's a miracle,
that's almost a miracle in itself,
that he does this on the same week
as all the other dying and rising festivals.
Last thing I wanna show, his mother Mary,
I got one more screen that I wanna show, and then I'm done.
His mother, all right, let's see, here it is.
Now, if you look at the oldest depictions of Mary
that exist, you always see she has the star on her head,
and she'll have two stars on her shoulders,
and it's the eight-pointed star Venus,
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
This is, if you guys could check me on this,
go and find the oldest picture of Mary in Jesus
that you can find.
I don't know if it's fourth century or third century
or what, just go and look them all, get them all,
put them all in one folder and just compare them all.
You'll see the majority of them have this sort of design,
usually she's wearing a blue garb,
star on the forehead, star on the shoulders.
Once again, this is a job for the classicists,
because if you pull up Eratosthenes,
or I'm sorry, this is not Eratosthenes, this is Higanus.
Higanus has a description of the maiden, the virgin.
He says the virgin, or the maiden, the quarry,
is located under the feet of Oxford.
She touches the hind part of the line with her head
and the equator with her right hand,
and the lower part of the body can be seen
with the water snake.
On her head, there is one faint star,
and one star on each of her shoulders,
and two on each wing.
Boom.
Think that's a coincidence too?
I doubt it.
So all I'm saying is, when you look at the New Testament
and the Gospels through the lens of a classicist,
all of them make sense.
It's a Greek text.
It's Greek culture.
It's written in Greek.
They don't have any Hebrew Gospels.
If you've even had one Hebrew Gospel,
I would say, okay, maybe you should look at it
through the Hebrew lens.
You don't.
You have four major Gospels,
plus a whole bunch of other Gospels
that aren't considered canon.
All of them Greek, and then a few Coptic ones,
no Hebrew ones.
None of this is a, this is a Hellenistic mystery religion,
in my opinion.
Caller Ruck even says that too.
It just, everything lines up.
Do you think someone who only studies Hebrew
would know about Hagianus' passage
about looking up, trying to find the stars
on the forehead of the Virgin?
She's the, it's the Virgin Mary.
So I'm just saying, like, all this stuff
seems to line up pretty good, but that's what I got.
Gorgeous.
Oh my God, I can't tell you how impressed I am.
My video may be screwed up,
but I gotta say, Gnostic Informa,
that is impenetrable, baby.
You brought out a, you know, if you and I
were going to a professional talk,
and we're both graduate students, we're doing our thing.
I'm proud.
I'm proud.
When you put that kind of evidence out there
and blow the heck out of people, right?
That's the way you do it, man.
I mean, you never plan these out.
Every time, every time I've come on here,
what happens is he'll start the show.
I'll just sit here and watch.
And as he's going, I'll start looking up sources
and pulling them up, and I'll,
and I just respond to what you said.
Every time, this is what we do, every time.
Look at how your facility with the sources is getting
to the point that you're quoting the actual Greek now
and you're working through the Greek.
You know when your skill is down and the dirt like that,
that's the kind of doctor you want.
You want somebody who knows the turf.
And good job.
I can't, now, the only thing that I would add
to all of that is, what do we do then?
Because you know there's a whole bunch of sources
out there, a whole bunch of people.
You can talk about it just about YouTube if you want,
but you can also talk podcasts and all sorts of stuff.
What do you do to get that information to them
that the Bible scholars, the incompetent Bible scholars
have been obscuring for the last 1800 years?
How do you get that,
how do you break through that ceiling, is all I'm saying?
I would say if it was 200 years ago, it would be very hard,
but now we're in the age of information and digital age
where anybody can access these texts.
Anybody can find a tutor for Greek through wizint.
200 years ago, you had to know somebody in your local town
that can teach you Greek.
So now we don't have any, it's almost like,
the way I want to answer that question is like,
what are the excuses to not be doing it?
We have every tool we need right now to just say,
forget about academia.
If they're in this dogmatic bubble anyway, who gives a shit?
Let them circle jerk each other with their citations
and write their books for their libraries
that no one's gonna read.
You're gonna write some academic book
that no one's gonna buy,
but you're gonna sell 500 copies
to all these different universities
and they're just gonna sit and get dusty.
Go ahead and have fun with that, knock yourselves out.
But there's a growing population of people like you and me
who wanna know what these texts really mean
and don't wanna be gaslit into nothing to see here.
There's nothing to see here, anybody.
Don't look at Halaria Festival, it means nothing.
Don't look at it.
Close your eyes.
I think the way forward is coming in the form of this library
because I just wanna stress one more time,
if people haven't caught this,
the library at Herculaneum,
it was covered with a pyroclastic flow,
perfectly charred those scrolls.
We've got 800 of them that they just finished scanning
and we'll be able now to translate and provide
to the community as a public library.
Now, the professors that are involved will tell you,
this is gonna change the way that we understand history.
You don't understand, this is the only library,
complete library that we have ever found.
And guess what, it's not filtered
through Eusebius' fourth century.
By the way, you know how much text we lost?
If you read like Plutarch,
it's early second century historian slash philosopher
and he's citing all these texts that he had access to
that somehow we've lost after Eusebius.
And the only stuff that was preserved
is what the Christians wanted to preserve.
And so, and by the way, and they edit texts
and they interpolate texts and they forge texts
and they basically in the fourth century,
history got rewritten.
And then you start getting all these history books
where they just take Josephus
and stick it in front of Xenophon and Herodotus
and pretend that that's the history.
No, it's never been the history.
Josephus has made up fairy tale about Moses and King David.
No one knew about that shit until like the fourth century.
I'm talking like most people didn't,
that wasn't part of like the history of like,
you read the sources from the Roman side and the Greek side,
they don't say anything about King Moses or Abraham or Noah.
That just doesn't exist at all.
And all of a sudden in the fourth century,
history gets rewritten and they take Josephus history
and stick it in front of Xenophon and Herodotus
and Thucydides and make it look like
that's what everyone's been,
everyone's always agreed to this the whole time.
No, it's not, that's not the case.
So, yeah.
It's bad, it's bad scholarship.
It's really more appropriation than scholarship.
But the lazy scholars of today need to get a kick in the pants
and to say, look, what do we have here?
By the way, this library that's coming out,
this library that's coming out,
it is people need to know that they suspect, okay,
now I'm gonna leave this to the archeologists, right?
They're the ones who figure I was on a dig myself at Megiddo.
I know how complex and how careful
and scientific classical archeologists are.
So more power to them, but they suspect,
they don't suspect, they're claiming
that this is the Julian Library.
So it is one of the families
that is attached to the Imperium, right?
Guys like Claudius or guys who are trying
to grow the Imperial Library, right?
Grow the Imperial Library.
Nero is sending out people to get scrolls
that are about certain things.
They're growing.
This library will have Sappho.
It will.
A Julian Library will have Sappho.
This thing will have works.
It'll have women that you have never heard of complete.
Complete.
Speaking of Hilaria and Addis, at Herculaneum,
they found a giant, not well, a pretty big decent size
statue of Addis sitting on a throne
where the wreath on his head holding a pomegranate.
And this is right where they're digging right now.
So my hope is they find some good sources in that regard.
And this can give us some more context
of what's going on for this time of the year
and why this was the celebration.
They've got a whole nother vault.
They've got a whole nother vault
that they're just opening now, right?
They haven't opened it yet,
but they're talking about opening it.
And it could have another 1,000 scrolls in it.
And this is that, you know, it's March for a reason, right?
Because of Mars, right?
You talked about Maw Wars, that older form.
Oh God, that stuff, it's the lupa.
It's the lupa, the wolf priestess.
The wolf priestess who suckles those children
because they were the children of a priestess of Mars.
She's the one, he's the one who got her, right?
And that vestal power, that vestal power
is coming through those wolves, the black wolf.
And they called it.
And yeah, suckling, suckling those young,
they called her lupa.
It was the word, it was the word
that was turned into prostitute.
But this is the month of Mars, baby.
And tomorrow, April, Aphrodite's month.
That's where the word April comes from,
it's from Aphrodite.
Don't you love it?
It makes sense, doesn't it?
It kind of makes sense.
It's the dog's erection.
Neil, why do you think it is, and then we'll go,
why do you think it is that people are so unwilling
to say, oh my God, look at the past,
look at where Christianity came from.
Look at where Judaism came from.
Because look, I just wanna say, I just wanna say,
I know that you occasionally get blamed
for me controlling your thoughts.
And you said that in the comments,
the comments, people think you write my scripts.
I took it as a compliment,
because that means that I'm showing myself
to have the knowledge of a great classicist
over time, so I'll take it.
Even though it's not true, you know, but.
It's an honor.
It insults you on some stuff as I'm writing it though.
So they are catching on a little bit.
As it's an honor, it's an honor, Neil,
to be associated with your work now,
because you're hitting hard.
You're hitting it hard and source-wise.
And I can be, I can honorably stand here and say,
with the people at our conference,
our classics conference, I can say, that's my student.
That's my student, you see.
Someday he'll be a master, you know what I mean?
And so we have to go through.
I think I'm getting pretty decent at Greek, right?
I'm getting there.
Yeah, you're getting there.
Hey, it's not that you get decent.
You're looking for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
You're looking for the one who's in that gym all the time.
That's the one, that's your personal goal.
And when you're doing that in Pumpin' Iron,
the Greek that you did tonight, absolutely fantastic.
I was proud you were reading it and I'm like, yeah.
I was getting all hot, you know what I mean?
Like mentally kind of worked up.
I was like, I was imagining, you know, maybe like a pastor,
you know what I mean?
And you giving it this way to have, oh God,
I know somebody out there is getting it, you know?
And Neil is giving it to you.
You're Hercules, that's what I wanna say.
Check out the Hercules.
Check out the source that I found regarding Pompeii.
Regarding Pompeii, I haven't pulled up right now.
So they found this, this is three months ago.
They found 13 sculptures appear to be tribute
to the cult goddess Kibeli, Sibeli, and Addis.
Let me just go back to what it says.
13 nativity, they call them nativity style.
What is she doing there?
She's pulling something out of there.
Anyways, 13 nativity style statuettes
have been found amid the ruins of Pompeii.
A discovery experts say it provides evidence
of pagan ritual traditions in the ancient Roman city.
Bam!
Pompeii archeologists said in a statement
that Christmas mangers were obviously not part
of the tradition in the pagan city,
which were wiped out, blah, blah, blah, blah.
But yes, this is what we're dealing with people.
This is what they're gonna find there.
I'm just trying to give people an example
of why it's such a big deal
that we dig in this part of the world.
This is what they were doing there.
Make sense?
Bravo, bravo, totally.
I don't think she was,
I don't know what she was doing there either,
but look at the influence.
Look at the influence.
Now, if you are a biblical scholar
and you're living in your biblical scholars bubble,
this is the kind of thing that has no meaning to you.
So can we really, I wanna liberate,
I wanna go in, Neil, and with just you and me,
Hercules, you're Hercules, and I wanna go in
and I wanna tear down that lie.
The one I hear so crazy
is not established by evidence.
Jerome in the fourth century wrote
that the nativity scene in Bethlehem,
where Jesus was supposedly born from Mary,
he says that site used to be the location
where a doneness was mourned over by Venus.
And they took over this site
and made it the nativity site.
Jerome is telling you this.
Do you wanna know what I,
so I wanted to know what Bible scholars say about this.
All of them across the board.
Jerome is wrong, Jerome is wrong.
This, there's nothing to see here, nothing to see here.
They all, there's a bunch of people,
they wrote articles about this thing, about this passage.
Basically telling their students,
just ignore this, Jerome is talking out of his ass.
Yeah, right.
This is the only time I trust Jerome.
I used to have a seminar called coffee with Jerome.
One of my favorite quotes of Jerome,
which I think puts his mind the most on display.
Here's the quote, are you ready?
There is nothing so incredibly ugly
as a naked pregnant woman.
That's what he said?
Yeah, yeah.
You saw, these people are diseased in the mind.
Yeah.
Is that the beautiful image, if you think about it?
That's the image.
Yeah, dude, you could, the sculptures, yeah.
That's the, you remember that chocolate-like
Kubaba statue they found in Eritrea, she's pregnant.
Yeah.
So that's, they are the exact opposite of how we think.
Yeah.
Look at the statues that you just pulled up, right?
This is the stuff that is abhorrent
when you commit to the God of child sacrifice.
This is what, now do you understand
where the Gnostics were giving them such a hard time?
Because they were like, bruh,
this dude is not all that good, you know what I mean?
Not for Abraham either, there's a passage in Judges,
Book of Judges.
By the way, Judges is the worst book ever.
There's a, there's a Jeff, Jeff Japheth.
Japheth, I don't know how to pronounce it.
Japheth, he sacrifices his daughter.
And the way the text is basically describing it is,
this man gave up his daughter, look how, look how
he gave up the greatest thing in his life
because he believes in God that much.
That's sick.
No, no God would ever make you do that.
They were reflecting the Jewish authors of the Septuagint
who were writing in Greek.
They were reflecting that Alexandrian current literature.
Just sucking that in.
And that's one thing you do beautifully
that I think, you know, it's another thing
that makes me proud to be able to work with you
and to have you on Lady Babylon is that
you do your homework with those sources
and you bring that, you bring that thing forward
that they're not able to do on the biblical side.
And that's another example of it.
Your perspective, you're talking about
when the Septuagint is being written
and it's totally revolutionary what you're saying, right?
Nobody's gonna wanna, can you imagine?
Neil, what if that catches on
and people start checking it and starts saying,
wait a minute, you know, this may not be as silly
as it sounds that it looks like, you know,
and you'll have people who will step forward
who are Hellenistic experts.
That's all they do is Hellenistic work
and bringing in 10 classicists, that's all they do
is Hellenistic writing.
This guy right here, Gamerkin,
he shows that Plato's Tameis is the same concepts
being brought forth in Genesis creation.
Is there a plate?
The people writing the Old Testament were playing this
or straight up?
And he proves it.
Do you realize how that historically makes perfect sense,
right?
It's not a fairytale.
You have to, in order to believe that stuff,
it's a fairytale that you have to swallow.
It's like history's fairytale.
Do you want to believe it?
And you're gagging on it.
But if you want to go to heaven, brah,
or you want to justify taking this land and owning it,
you got to follow the, you got to swallow,
you know what I mean?
All right, I've kept you far too long.
Thank you everybody for coming tonight.
I want to, I'm going to give Neil the last word.
What's the word to end us to take us out tonight?
I got it, the perfect thing I want to say.
Just remember, don't let the holiday of the spring
be taken over by something that came way later.
Go to the sources and remember,
this is a special time for resurrection
and renewal of nature.
The plants are going to start growing soon.
The trees are going to start budding soon.
Flowers are going to start sprouting up soon.
And that's what we are celebrating.
That is the real resurrection.
All that other stuff came later
and it's just a fabrication and degradation
of what really was, what the real true Easter
yostra season is.
And to that, I say, Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Siphy and Arch is riding on warm back,
purple rain, shower, latex, the lawnmower man
with the plan, blazing the good stuff, twist stuff.
Let's go down the list with all the ingredients,
original sources, psychedelic potions,
double trouble, ridiculous, meanest,
the producer hung on the temple of high,
snake witch queen of the dragons,
throwing weed in the graveyard,
with kisses of poison for you.
Just come and see it tonight,
lick you with the dragon venom of the darkest time.
But the dragon queen, snake witch of the darkest time.
Come to you whispering, dance with the music.
But the dragon queen, snake witch of the darkest time.
Come to you whispering, dance with the music.
So cool, so cool, so cool, so cool, so cool, so cool, so cool, so cool, so cool, so cool.
