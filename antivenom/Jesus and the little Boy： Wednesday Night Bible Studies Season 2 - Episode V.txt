Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met I wanted so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that hawk called destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Boy are you in for it tonight
Tonight we're going to get back in our timeship
And I'm going to leave us right in the little bubble
In the bushes in the Garden of Gethsemane
Tonight we're going deep, chewy, it's light speed, hit it!
Music
Look, I'm not cruel. You know, there's no way to do this better than to take along a child of God
And to have them attempt to entice you to go into the fairy tale backyard
It's usually in the back or it's in the crypt, right?
It's a space that the early Christians are creating this mystery right
It's a place where we come back to a very serious topic
Today I'm going to take you somewhere
I'm going to take you right to Gethsemane right now
We're going right now, you're going to love this
But in order to get there I want to sacrifice, right?
We need, we're necromancers
And I'm assuming that you have your ears to hear and that you're sitting on the throne
We are necromancers and this is how we function
We're going to bring this false reality to you
This fairy tale in the form of a dude, of a dude
What we're doing is we're sacrificing tonight
Reverend Renner, his distinguished one
We're looking at his work
Because he has had the real courage to step forward and say
Who is this naked kid with Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane?
So we catch him there, Mr. Renner
But we think that we're going to get an explanation
I'll tell you, be careful, we're going to go behind the building or into the crypt
We're going down there
And there's going to be some funny things that go on
Let's bring him up, let's bring him up
Let's have a response to this fellow
We're going to do this in a little tiny clips
Hit it
Gethsemane was immense
It covered nearly the whole slope of the Mount of Olives
What we call the Garden of Gethsemane was much more than just trees
It was a cemetery, there were graves
Yeah, first of all, the name Gethsemane, they'll tell you
Right, the first thing he's going to tell you
He hasn't done it yet, but he will
He's going to tell you that this is from the Aramaic
And it means the place of the oil press
Well, no, if it's from the Greek
It means the Pleasure Stones
The Pleasure Stones, isn't that a word for stones?
This is a district
This is a district in a park area
Where there are things like cemeteries
Monuments
Yeah, nice, love it
Anyway, and part of this is called the place
If it's in the Greek, it's the place of the stone pleasure
It's a place that we know that Jesus hung out
It's a place that we know that Jesus hung out
Okay, let's keep that, let's keep that in mind
Okay, hit him again, bring him again
And Jesus came into the grotto to pray regularly
With his apostles
And it was there that Jesus spoke the words, I am he
And the Bible tells us in John chapter 18
That all the soldiers who came to arrest him
When they heard those words, I am he
They begin to do something very strange
All those soldiers begin to go backward
And the King James Version says they fell to the ground
Okay, so here we are, we're in the garden
And all of a sudden a group
A group comes up
These are not regular forces
Yeah, these are heavily armed
Members of the cohort
Yeah, now there's no indication of how many of them came
He drew from the cohort though to bring it
So we've got temple security
We've got civic, local civic forces
And we've got a crack group
These are the guys you send for the big bus
Anyway, so here they come
Here they come and Judas has led them there
Fantastic, now it's going to get a little bit dark from here
It's going to get a little bit dark from here
He's going to tell us something happened
These soldiers suddenly got drowsy
Okay, now we're going behind the building
Yeah, now we are, come on kids
You've got to know this
You don't know what his skill is
He can tell you
It's because the ancient Greek says it's that way
And let me tell you something
He is lying through his teeth
Let's just look at what the Greek says
Okay, hit us another clip, please
You read the Greek, the words go backward
Really means to wobble, to stumble
They lost their bearing
Jesus says they fell, the Greek word pipto
Which means to fall hard
Jesus released such a blast of divine power
When he said those words, I am he
Which in Greek literally means I am
Yeah, he set off
Wait, I'm just, wait
That's when you realize it's dark
And you're in the basement
What are we doing down here?
How many of us have found ourselves in that position?
What are we doing here?
Jesus let off a what?
Jesus had a blast of what?
That's what the text says, believe you
Because you said you do the Greek
That's what the text says, really, really
Let's go to the, let's go to the
John 15, please
Or 18
This is John 18, this is the text
That he's talking about
Yeah, good
Look at starting at six
That's the, that's the ego
The ego Amy is the response, right
So in the world of the basement
In the fairy tale they will tell you
Jesus spoke out, boom, like a
You know, it's kind of just magic
Everybody falls down
Right, it gets better
Just wait, it gets better
But that's not what the Greek says
That's not what the Greek says at all
Bring the Greek up again
What does it say?
Ego Amy, why is he saying ego Amy?
He's saying I am
Because they asked him, are you Jesus of Nazareth?
And he says, because it's a crowd
A delegate of soldiers
Right, they brought out the unit
That takes down the real bad guys
They're heavily armed
Right, we're going to see this
Jesus makes a note of this
He says something out of his own mouth
Out of his own mouth
Tonight we have firsthand evidence
We've been trying to establish a motive here
For Jesus, and there are those of you
Who have been saying, you know
It's not, things are not so bad
Right, we have to understand here
That we can get rid of the religiosity
But we can't get rid of that core
Let's look at the core
I have no arguments for you
I have no opinions, I have no...
You can quote me as saying nothing
That thou shouldst do or not do anything
Yeah, here we serve the text baby
This is the museum, we serve the text
Let's look at what that text says
John, bring him up
Excellent, thank you so much
Ape'olthon es ta'opiso
kai epesan jamai
Yeah, so they said, are you Jesus?
He said, I am
And it says they went around to his back
They circled him
They went around him so he couldn't get away
And epesan jamai, they fell on him
They attacked, the Greek uses this for falling all the time
All the time, one enemy falls upon another
So they surround him and they take him
They start to arrest him
They grab him, right
And as they're going for him, Jesus says
Let's go to the next text
This is the one from Mark
Yeah, so they're around him
And they're getting...
The arrest is being made
They've identified who he is
And they're taking him down
And what happens?
Jesus responds to them, right
As they're coming on to him
He says, what have you come out here?
With your swords and with your clubs?
That's a military club, right?
It's a big thing
That's a big deal
They came out with battering rams this time
And flash grenades, right?
They came out and what did they say?
Look at the end of the first line, haus
Haus, look at the two first words in the next line
Ape'olthon es ta'opiso
Take it down
You're coming at me as if
You're coming against
Or coming to arrest
Or coming to apprehend
A lacedace
What is that?
What is that?
People like to translate it as robber
Robber
But that doesn't make it
That doesn't quite make it there
Jesus says, where are you guys so heavily armed for?
What did you come out against me for?
You know, would you look at your armed resistance?
Would you come out?
Let's look at the translate
Look at the...
There we go
Here's the definition of lacedace, right?
It's from Leidzo
For those of you who are in Greek, right?
Good
And notice that
They first give you robber or pirate
And you thank yourself, wait a minute
Pirate?
Jesus is saying, what's your guys
Come out here so heavily armed
Like I'm a pirate?
Right?
What does that mean?
Well, it's especially somebody at sea
So there's some kind of sea connection
That's where we're getting pirate
Brigand
Buccaneer, right?
Buccaneer
Later, perates
Now you know where you get the word pirate from
Yeah, but what kind of...
What are these?
Shiver me timbers?
These aren't the guys that make Johnny Depp
Look good
This is not that kind of a pirate
Right?
These are sex traffickers
Should we bring up that same?
Look at the very bottom
Used by Lycophron
Who is Lycophron?
Lycophron is the poet who is
Preserving the song of Cassandra
Yeah, the song Cassandra
Who is the Bacchic Sibyl
Yeah, wonderful, wonderful
And you'll notice there in that Lycophron
It's okay, you'll notice there in that Lycophron
That we have a reference to
Child abduction
Yeah, it turns out in antiquity
I mean, let me just lay this thing straight
You want to come to the garden of
The garden of grave delight
Here we are in this place
Take a whiff around
You know what you smell?
You smell groups of traffickers
Who will sail into a port
Jump off the ship armed
Armed with enough force
To overwhelm the local authorities
And take kidnap
Take prisoner
Young men and young women
Boys and girls
And this kind of thing
Oh, why do they take them?
To take them somewhere in traffic
Them to sell them, right?
Yeah, to sell them
It's not very nice
It's not very nice indeed
Yes, but this is the word
The lady says the word for this trafficker
And so when Jesus says
Would you come out against me so heavily armed
What do you think I am, a trafficker?
The fact that there's a naked kid
Standing next to him
The fact that there's a naked kid
Standing next to him
And that verb that's used for a company
When it says the naked boy was accompanying Jesus
That verb is the verb that is used
Of soldiers and of slaves
Yeah, there was that boy
Accompanying him naked
Let's hear what else he has to say
About the...
Go ahead
Jesus was declaring that he was God in the flesh
And there was such a blast of power
It knocked all the soldiers to the ground
Eventually they got up
They regained their bearings
And Jesus surrendered himself to them
And as they walked out of the grotto
Out of the cave through this area
The Bible tells us
In Mark chapter 14 verses 51 and 52
About something very unusual
It says suddenly there appeared in the midst of them
A naked boy with a linen cloth
Who is the naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane
Who is that naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane
Who is that naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane
Alas, someone is finally talking about it
Nice job
Nice job
It's taken us, what is this?
1,400 years
We solved it once a long time ago
He's a cousin
He's a cousin
Now, okay, so let's see
This whole thing about the...
This whole thing about the...
We'll come back to the glory bomb in a minute
Don't play that video
This will come back to the glory bomb in just a second
But the blowing off of the feet
You can see it's not even in the text
Right?
And you'll notice that
Translators since Tyndale
Have been following this same path
So you can track this man, Mr. Renner's education
You can get it down to his education
About where he came up with these ideas
When he says, I am
And let's off the glory bomb
Causing all the soldiers to fall around
Right?
And by the way, that stuff he said about balance
There's not in that at all
It's not there at all
He's making stuff up
That's why I'm saying, these are lies
He is making stuff up
There's nothing to do with staggering
In that Greek, period
Nothing
They simply went around and took custody of him
Right?
Took him down
Yeah, yeah
It's a bust, right?
It's a bust
And they've got a big unit out there
This is fantastic
Okay, hit him again
Well, all around the grotto
All around the Garden of Gethsemane
There were graves, including fresh graves
This was a dead boy
That's why he was carrying a linen cloth
Or a burial shroud
The Jews buried their people naked
And covered them with that kind of a shroud
This boy was laying in his grave
And when Jesus spoke those words, I am he
The same power that knocked 300 to 600 soldiers
On to their back
Apparently touched a dead boy
That had recently been buried
The boy came crawling out of his grave
With his linen cloth
Stumbles into the midst of the whole scene
That's taking place in the Garden of Gethsemane
Or here we find the moment of Jesus' arrest
Okay
So if I got this straight
The fairytale view is
Jesus set off a glory bomb
The soldiers hit the deck
And because they were close
To a fresh dead boy
He crawled out of the grave
I mean, this is zombies
Does anybody else see this as zombies?
This man believes in zombies
Out comes this boy
Fantastic. Let's hit him one more time
This is just, it's overwhelming
It's overwhelmingly bad
When this man takes you into the back
Okay, and he starts this act
Right?
You don't know that his Greek is wrong
It is
Plainly, openly
Yes, okay
Let's finish him off
That was another miracle
A periphery resurrection
And when the soldiers and the religious leaders
Saw the resurrected boy
They said, somebody get that boy
Because they didn't want news
Of another resurrection
In that very moment
Jesus' power is simply immense
It shows up all the time
And today, I want to talk to you about
Jesus' power showing up in your life
Yeah, and that's how it starts
That's how it starts
Show me on the dolly
Yeah, that's how it starts
Did you hear how he's going in there
And in for the...
He's going in
This is the hunt, right?
He's praying on you
And he's going to come in
I want to show you Jesus' power
Wait a minute
You just made up
A bunch of nonsense
Right?
Even what he said about the scene down
Right?
It is not a burial shroud
It is not the word for burial shroud
It's the word for linen strip
It's just a piece of linen cloth
That's all
It's a piece of linen cloth
Yeah, and if this guy
Had had five minutes
To read some Galen
He might see how these linen bandages work
Yeah
Yeah, the kid runs off naked
Jesus is calling himself
A child sex trafficker
The people that show up
Oh, by the way
For those of you who want a little more context
By the way, with the child sex trafficking
In antiquity
There we go
With the child sex trafficking in antiquity
Sometimes it can get kind of formalized
And when the pirates show up
You have a certain number of
Teens that they need to be given
Yeah, and that keeps them from coming back
They only come back once a year
Right?
And the mothers in antiquity
Are singing about these things
Yeah, about how terrible it is
To be taken in those captives
And to have your child ripped from you
In order to enter into this
Garden of delight
Where these kids are sold off
Yeah, it's a big
Abduction
And abduction for the purposes of sexual abuse
Is a very prominent industry
In antiquity
So when Jesus calls himself
A trafficker
He's noticing as you see
He's clearly pointing out
You've got the weapons
Right?
You brought the specialized unit
Right?
And this guy says 600
Right?
Because he thinks when the Greek says
He went to the cohort
He thinks he got every person in the unit
Right?
No
He didn't
Right?
And they didn't fall down
Because of the glory bomb
Don't we have some...
Look, we tried to make a
Representation of this thing
Hit it, Chewie
I don't think it works
Let's just call it
You've got my hands
When we have the chance
That's enough
Fantastic
I don't know if that captured it
I don't know if that captured it
And before we move on to our serious ending
I do need a moment of subliminal zane
Do you have just a moment of subliminal zane?
There we go
Fantastic
You can check that out later
The...
By the way, thank you, Zane
For the contribution of all your music
I hope you like what I'm doing with it
Thank you very much
What do we do with that glory bomb?
Alright, so we're in a situation now
Look, guys, we have an option
We can't...
I can't keep taking you back to these scenes
And exposing you to them
Without it seriously affecting us all
Right?
So we have to understand
We have to get it clear
That we are talking about a time
And a place and very specific things
Very specific historical events
And the only thing that we can trust
Is the language
The language preserves this
The language preserves what the actual statement was
That Jesus made
He said, you're arresting me
He said, well, what?
You're arresting me like I'm a
Pirate of people
You know, like I'm a sex trafficker
So...
No accomplices
Prostitutes
And accountants
Arrested in the public park at 4 a.m.
With a naked boy
Armed resistance was provided
So we think we've come to the place
That Jesus regularly hangs out
Where he does his biz
You don't see him doing any carpentry, do you?
Right?
But he is hanging out with prostitutes
And accountants
With naked boys
In places that we know
Are the necromancers
Hang
His place to hang
He's waiting there for the dawn
He's waiting there for the dawn
You know the process
Of trading children and antiquity
Is directly connected
With cult mystery
Are you surprised?
You shouldn't be
Jehovah has his Ganymede
Right?
We understand this
So we provide
Jesus
It looks like we've got enough evidence
To say that there is a direct association
Between Jesus, a.k.a. the Christ
And the sex trade
First century
First third of the first century
Yeah, good stuff
Good stuff
It's important to me
Because you trust me
It's important to me
To give you the most accurate information possible
So when I'm showing you those words
That's why I'm trying to give you the
The philological background
And to show you, hey, see this?
It's just translating here this, right?
Because I have nothing to sell you
Now, Reverend
Reverend Glorybaum
We'll just call him
Reverend Glorybaum
Who has, you know
For those of you who say it's too much
You're being too harsh on Reverend Glorybaum
No, no, no, no
We raid these basements
And when we find
When we find the evangelicals and the Catholics
We find the Presbyterians and the Baptists
And we find the free church of Christ
And the holy, immaculate, nationalist association
Of we're going to take over the world
When we find them taking people into places
Where they're taking advantage of them
It's our duty to stand up to that
You know
So, so far what we've got
I wanted to show you a little bit of the prophecy
Of Cassandra
And I wanted you to see
There's a lovely, there's some lovely imagery there
And some talk of what you can do with your daughters
You can dedicate your daughters to the temple
And they'll be protected
And we as members of the community
Who worship Hecatee and protect those virgins
We take up weapons, stones, bows
Against those pirates
Who we catch with our children naked
It turns out
The chief pirate
Is the son of God
Get your hands off him
Parents were saying
Get your hands off him
All right
Stop touching my children
It's what people told Jesus
He was like, don't scandalize me
Yeah
Maybe that's what it is
When the priest is
I just want to finish with Gatier
When the priest
At his ordination
Sees the vampirist
And knows the beauty
He gains a perspective
And he can never go back
His God's righteousness
Turns into oppressive pain
Yeah
Because he's seen her
And he knows
Yeah
Gatier
Thank you
Tonight
I've taken up 30 minutes of your time
And I believe that that's all the time
That I will take up tonight
I want to make an announcement
Before we go
I want to make an announcement
That Friday
We will be having
Our fight club
Where only the sons of Heracles
Will be allowed to enter
I've told Chewie
You don't get in without your wig
And your Victoria's secret
We should bleep that out
Should I not?
Yeah
Here he is
Heracles
You love him
You love his gown
Look, there's the queen
There's the queen
There she is
So you don't get into the fights
Unless you come
In proper kit
And we will be taking
The movement that we've been
The forward motion that we've been accumulating
We're going to take that
We're going to drive that into the form
Of the practicing
The working of the mystery
Yeah, we're going to expose
Expose that to people
So that they can see
Right, let's get back in the ship
This is enough, I guess, isn't it, right?
This is enough
We're there
We see Jesus
He's calling himself a child trafficker
Right, not only that
But remember, guys
He shows up with the stuff
The goop all over him
You don't know what that is
What's he been doing with that kid?
What's that rag for?
Right, they don't know these things
Right
It always comes back to that dracina
That dracina
That our prophetess Cassandra talks about
Who bears that venom
It always comes back to her
Cassandra says she has the dipsass
She calls her
She calls her the very same title
Of Jesus's anti-venom
That he didn't get on the cross
Right, that's hers
That's hers
Thank you, Magdal
The Scythian maga
That's fantastic
You see, there's a brighter
We've been looking at Jesus
The child trafficker with his naked boy
But there's a much brighter light around it
That is divine
That is divine
And that's her
The fact that she is controlling
From the back room
Right?
It's amazing
It's magic control
Love it
Mary the Magdal
Yeah, fantastic Scythian word for maga
Wait a minute
You thought Magdalene was from this in the Hebrew
No, it's not
Yeah, it's not
You mean I shouldn't have studied Hebrew in seminary?
No, you shouldn't have
You're wasting your time
Yes, it's all in Greek, bro
Just read it
Read it
Pirate, laystace, and realize
That every time you go to church
And every time you take that communion
And every time you give your attention
To that power
You are propping up
History's most popular child sex trafficker
I think that's it
Let's call it there
But before we do
Let's take one more look at the image
Let's take one more look at the image
Of where we're getting all of this
Viper venom, the stipsass
Go ahead
Hail Satan
And if you can, avoid the pirate
Who sells children and any of his followers
Show me the girl I never met
I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace
Where is that horse called destiny
I think she ran off without me
