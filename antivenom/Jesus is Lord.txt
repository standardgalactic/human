It's hours tonight.
Madea and the snake charmers
Dragon venom think of vipers
Make you hemorrhage blood
Hemlock wolves bang
Lavender moon rise
They're at it again
Electrical blood
Bind you with wonderful drugs
Raw opium drifts
Hail Satan in the dark harbor
Open your eyes
Give you vision
Go to the serpent temple
And take some dragon venom
In the power of the black mirror
I'm with the root cutters
The darn bringers
Madea the sorceress
Venus producer of the sweetest nectars
Dance with the muse
The radio specter
The muse sings to me
Whisper lev fate
Hold my heart so dear
Dancing in a dream
Hail Satan
Oh, God, I can feel it coming tonight.
Oh, I love it. I love it. I love it.
I'm going to give you a gift.
I'm going to give you a gift,
but I'm going to start out with a mood setter
while we get ready and the ship is running.
We're going back in time.
I want you to be able to set
the mood.
Hit it. Where's that first?
Where's that first slide?
Give it to me, Chewie.
Read this together quickly and then we'll get to the gift
because I got you a gift tonight.
What are we talking about tonight?
She is who we're talking about here tonight.
We're talking about the sotera.
The sotera.
What is the sotera?
The better question is, who is the sotera?
Before there was a savior,
Jesus, who was Christed,
there was a savior
who led the people of Athens.
Yes, yes.
What did she end up giving us?
Oh, God, you're going to love it.
It's all the beauty.
It's all the gorgeousness and gorgeosity.
How are we going to get to her tonight?
We're going through a dead dude.
I'm telling you this.
A dead dude who copied another dead dude.
This is a fifth century dead dude
copied another dead dude from the first and second.
And that dead dude copied a third dead dude
from Hellenistic Greece.
Woo, Alexandria baby.
Alexandria is where he was.
And what was he?
He was a lexicographer.
He was a what?
He was a writer of words.
We have, through his descendants,
we have passed on his work.
It's unusual words.
Imagine it this way.
It's a dictionary of unusual words.
And there are 50,000 of them.
You mean the ancient Greek language,
such a great and powerful mother,
Guinness Book of World Records,
strong, strongest human language.
Yeah.
You mean she had 50,000?
Well, strange or unique words.
Yes.
It took some sophistication to define.
Yes.
And guess what?
We have those 50,000.
That's more than most languages function on.
Oh, God.
Just the unusual words.
Did you know there's 10,000 and alpha alone?
This is the lexicon by Seekus.
Love it.
He's the final copyist.
Basically, this guy from Alexandria.
Oh, it's lovely.
It's lovely.
It's a treasure.
It's a treasure for linguistic analysis,
because you can tell what words are coming from.
There's no, we don't need into your pen, right?
That's imaginary.
Woo.
No, we have written down Pulaski.
And oh, God, it's gorgeous.
Calcolithic.
Think of the horses.
Live on your horse, right?
I just cut out a considerable number of the audience.
We have to learn that way to get back to that native Greek
to see what it's doing.
Let's see.
Bring that first one back up.
We're looking for the savior.
Look at her here.
So theta.
And by the way, we're going to have Gnostic on in about 45
minutes.
Gnostic.
He's got some things to talk about.
Some goodies.
He's getting the goodies over and over again.
Look.
So what is this?
So theta.
That's Athena.
What is, what does her name mean?
Her name means she who's without death.
He, he said, what?
He said, the savior is she who is without death.
Athena.
She is the guardian of everything that you need.
She stands.
She stands with justice.
Oh, love it.
Love it.
What else does it say about the savior?
For those of you who are evangelicals, we're looking at the savior, the savior.
This is before Jesus.
This is what Jesus borrowed when he took his 12 kitties and turned them into prostitute.
I'm going to show you tonight from his seekius right out of the Greek, right out of the Greek.
This is going to shake your world.
First, let's shake your world.
Let's really shake your world.
I'm giving a gift now.
I'm giving a gift.
Give me the next.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Before we get there.
I just want people to notice.
Give that first one.
Look at the end of this.
Look at the end of this line.
What else is the savior?
What else is the salvation congregation?
It is according to Galen and Antidotus.
It's an antidote.
It's an antidote.
That's curious.
Very curious tonight.
We're going to go to the purple.
We're going to go to the purple and I'm going to bring you the purple.
Are you ready?
Are you ready, people?
Are you ready?
Bring it up.
Now, I promised you we would fulfill the prophecy.
We would bring everything into complete and perfect unity with the song of the muse.
And tonight we're going to do that.
Are you ready?
Oh, I'm working on the purple.
Boom.
What happens?
A reporter friend of mine, a journalist friend of mine says, oh my God.
And Aquine, an all around great guy says, hey, did you see this today?
Boom.
Give me that article.
Here.
You wanted it.
You blood sucking purple loving people.
Incredibly rare die says CBS news.
That was once worth more than gold found in the UK.
Seriously.
You got to say that seriously.
Worth more than gold.
Really?
Oh my God.
What does that say about us?
Look at our ancestors.
Just human ancestors.
Look at how they're looking at us.
Look what they're seeing.
It's the watchers, man.
You can only go so long with the watchers.
Give me the next part of the article.
You wanted it now.
Archeologists working in England found a mysterious lump of a purple substance that in Roman times
would have been worth more than gold.
Shut up with about the money.
Research is fantastic.
Let's go to the next one.
What they do with this purple lump.
I could have told them, chewy.
I could have told them what they can do with the purple lump.
The substance was found during a 2023 excavation.
That's just about around a quarter, one of a Roman bathhouse, a bathhouse.
That's a place for hygiene, baby.
That's a place for hygiene.
What do you find there, chewy?
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
A bathhouse.
The remains of the third century.
Oh, it's the third century.
Building exists on the grounds of what is now a cricket club.
Who cares?
Tear down that cricket club.
Every Brit just went, oh, off the rocker.
That's how you get to it underneath.
It's all the junk on top that gets in the way.
Tell those people.
Go play your cricket around the corner.
Go, street cricket.
The team works with the British Geological Society to test the material.
Fantastic.
Look, didn't, wasn't there, didn't somebody say something about this somewhere back there?
Somewhere, somebody said they're going to find the purple.
They found purple.
They found the purple.
Isn't that nice?
Oh, God.
You thought, look, for, for everybody who was uncomfortable and was like, are you sure?
I need to double check this.
Here you go.
The library's first contribution was the purple porfura.
What is the latest contribution?
The latest contribution is the porfura.
That's what we do.
All right.
Are you ready for the power of the muse?
Are you ready for the power of the muse?
Amen.
You're a treasure.
Thank you.
That's so nice.
I mean that sincerely.
I know you do.
You're a great guy.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.
Oh, that's a little darkness in that.
Love it.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
Boom.
Here's what I want to bring you guys.
What is that?
It says right here, right?
These are the definitions that we have in our lexicon.
Our lexicon.
What are we doing?
We're defining Greek words, not by some British dude's mouth with the stale 1850 air.
Who brought that corpse in?
There's always, you're always going to have to have that.
Who brought that corpse in?
There's always, you're always going to have a Victorian corpse.
Whenever you study classics, you have to have some Victorian corpse somewhere.
You sit on its chest and it breathes out this air of pomposity.
It's stale.
You're dead, Alfred.
You're dead.
Come here, Alfred.
Alfred's my dead Victorian friend.
Come here, Alfred.
Hold on your pants, Alfred.
Why is that so much louder, Chewie?
Then in my ears, let's go.
Let's keep going.
Ceterion.
What is it?
It's a kind of a drug.
It's a plant grass, right?
Poa.
It's a paw with a soon weargoss.
What is that?
That's old.
That's old terminology, baby.
What is that?
It's a power to create something, to bring about a change.
What's that change directed at?
Directed at your hormones, baby.
We're going to give you some aphrodisiac.
We're going to give you some aphrodisiac.
That's what Ceterion is.
Ceterion, very well known ancient drug.
So look at this.
Hesechius, he's tracking the drugs too because these are esoteric.
These are technical terms, right?
Remember, there's 50,000 of these technical terms.
And just in Alpha alone, just in Alpha alone, there's 9,000.
That's 1,000 more in one letter than Hebrew.
Ancient Hebrew has of all its words.
That's 1,000 more.
And by the way, with the Hebrew, it's 8,000.
And again, this is ancient Hebrew, which is a fabrication.
Modern Hebrew, thriving.
Thriving.
There are like 60,000 somewhere in that range.
I've seen higher estimations that it's an engine.
This ancient stuff, it's not an engine.
And it turns out 2,000 of those words, 2,000 of those 8,000 are names.
They're proper names.
You can't count those.
That's not unique words.
Oh, God.
So it went down to 6,000 now.
I'm telling you, if we can get through breakfast with that language.
Oh, God, don't worry about it.
You know what it is?
It's a beauty contest.
Linguistic history.
I'm giving you this one tonight because we're on a date.
We're on a date and I love it.
Linguistic history is beauty contest.
It's beauty contest.
Oh, God, where's that golden apple?
We're giving it to grace.
We're giving it to that Greek language that came up with so much beauty.
You know what that word barbarian means?
You know what that word barbarian means?
It means somebody who's paratonic.
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
You can hear it.
They're describing people based upon their language.
This is so unique.
It's so unique.
There's a musicality to the language and it's not just meter.
It's a real power.
It's a musical power.
Oh, God.
Okay, let's go.
I love it.
People look.
Let's blow everybody.
Joey, let's blow everybody's mind and bring them the sources.
Anything they see.
Okay.
Be careful for everybody who is here, who is, you know, needs a PG script.
The Saturoi.
What are they?
They're the forms that are indecent.
These are the obscene bits.
You know what I'm talking about because in our religion, people, when we walk into a
temple of the muse, what do we find?
Somebody asked me just recently.
They said, what is the word?
What's this temple of the muse thing?
He said, look, we've got the very heart and center is the beating heart of the museum,
the place where the muse is worshiped.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Get ready for your inappropriate bits because in the center of this temple to the muse,
the Pythagoras says you can't start a civilization without in the heart.
What's in the heart of her temple, Chewie?
It's a big phallus.
It's a phallus of Bacchus.
Don't you know that this is where we start.
Those Athenians were into the snake venoms.
Oh God, those Pulaskians.
Did we forget about Pulaskians?
Neil, tell us about the Pulaskians.
Go to the next one.
We need to get through these.
You know, this is a quick trip.
Quick trip.
Look at this, people.
I'm going to introduce you to something.
Welcome.
Watch the Pulaski and come through the language.
Are you ready?
Here's the dictionary.
You ready?
Sa-o-kis.
Sa-o-kis.
Sa-o-kis.
He-sa-mo-thra-ke.
Hudo-se-kale-to.
To-prote-ron.
This is how they used to call Samothrace.
The island, they used to call it what?
Sa-o-kis.
Oh, fantastic.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Who were those original inhabitants of Samothrace?
Who were those Atokhthonoi?
Who were those Atokhthonis people?
Were they?
They were Pulaskians.
They were part of that Calculithic horse culture.
Their name was all about, you guessed it, purple.
Purple.
Really?
It's all about purple?
Yeah.
It's all about purple.
Show us.
We're going to see the purple.
We're going to bring you the purple.
Are you ready?
Now, they just brought it in England.
Thanks.
The Newcastle was one of the universities, by the way.
They was involved with that.
And I just want to say, I had a lovely time at Newcastle.
I gave a paper there, and I was sitting in the lobby
and enrushed a group of prostitutes who embraced me,
cheered me up, pinched my cheeks, called me some names.
I thought for sure.
One of them said, Governor.
Oh, it was God.
It was lovely.
Newcastle.
Thumbs up.
Thumbs up, Newcastle.
Loved it.
Beautiful experience.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
Ta-da.
Oh, here it is.
You want to know?
No.
No.
Was the one before that?
No.
Yeah.
We need to.
Oh, God.
Who, by the way, the salvation that we're just looking at,
the salvation of sauce.
Who is sauce, this old divinity?
Who is this?
It's Helios.
And for the wait, don't take it down to you.
And for those of you who don't recognize,
that is the great, the great son,
the grandfather of the Medewa.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Let's see.
Where are we, people?
Look at the second word, Babylonian.
You people.
We ended up in Babylon tonight.
Doesn't that have fun with the queen of Babylon?
And who is ruling?
It's Helios.
Right?
It's Helios in his line that is ruling.
And the Medewa is directly in the line.
She's the virgin who breathed the fire.
And she only got that way because she figured it out.
Brilliant.
It's pure brilliance.
The first Christ was a Bronze Age woman named
Matia, who lived in Colchis.
Oh, God.
And rule Babylon.
Can you believe that?
That's gorgeous.
Good.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
Brilliant mind.
Totally disregarded.
When they threw out all the female authors,
they lost a lot.
They lost a lot.
They lost all the keys.
Go for it.
Hit us with it.
What is our salvation?
Those of you who have been intrepid and gone to Bible school,
and by the way,
I'm not going to give you the website yet for AmenU.
Still coming up.
Still coming up.
Pardon me.
Still coming up.
But for those of you who have been inquiring, right?
Wait.
Wait.
Hopefully next Friday.
Hopefully it's up by next Friday.
Thank you for your patience.
I want everybody.
We want to facilitate this in a way that anybody who wants to enlist,
can enlist.
Oh, God.
What is sotaria?
It's salvation.
And look.
Look at the word that we have.
It's saotaria.
Right?
Where does salvation come from?
It comes from saos.
It comes from saos.
You mean it doesn't come from Jesus?
No.
There was no Jesus then.
There was no Jehovah then.
Yeah, we're talking about there was no Pharaoh.
There were no Egyptians, bro.
We're talking about the old stuff.
We're talking about the old stuff.
Now I know the purple was announced and prophesied of and now has arrived.
Oh, guess what's coming?
Guess what's coming?
Oh, you're going to love this.
Go to the next.
Go to the next one, Gnostic.
Thanks for popping in.
I will be there shortly, sir.
Give us the next one.
I want you to absorb.
Now I want you to sit back and absorb some of this.
What are some of the other terms that I want you to notice as we are walking among the cult?
Right?
And as we know, Lady Babylon, what are some of the, look, we've got forms of drugs.
Here's one.
Akinite.
And here's the old name for it.
Sadomostis.
Give you the next one.
Akinite.
What's Akinite?
Didn't I see that?
Where's that?
Didn't I?
Give me the Akinite.
Do you have a picture of the Akinite?
Oh, we didn't bring Akinite with us tonight.
Oh, look at the loveliness of the Akinite.
What does it do to you?
It's a cardio.
Go ahead.
Take that.
It's a cardio toxin and a neurotoxin.
Both.
And you know what's funny?
Wolfsbane.
Right?
Yeah.
The leucophon.
Right?
That wolf killer.
Oh, it's a cardio.
Just can kill you.
Terrible.
Except when you pair it with atropine.
Do you know where you get that atropine?
You get that atropine with the Belladonna's.
Jimson, what you do is when you put those together, you have the perfect balance of the
death inducer with the antidote.
Salvation.
Salvation.
That's how you get born again.
That's how you get born again.
Give us the next one.
Boom.
Joey, we got to go galaxy to galaxy tonight.
Watch this.
What are the drugs?
They're awesome.
Make on us.
You know, this is the one that gives you the lethy.
Are you guys ready to induce some lethy?
Wait a minute.
What is this?
Opium?
Yeah, it's opium.
Now remember, it's not a cedulated morphine.
It's not heroin.
It's opium.
Yeah.
And everybody's on it.
Everybody who's anybody is on it.
Why?
Because when you pair it with the theriac, the negative effects are ameliorated and the
positive effects of that opium off the charts.
You know the Romans grow opium?
The great poet Virgil describes how to grow it best.
Right?
How do you raise those poppies?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
Let's go on to the next one.
On the heat.
They're going to say, he's promoting.
No, I'm not promoting anything.
I'm giving you the history.
Watch.
What is a selates?
That's another.
That's another kind of odd term for cochleas.
We're defining it through the Greek.
Look at the mastery.
We're not using English intermediary.
We're using the ancient Greeks telling you what it means.
What is that cochleas?
That is our little mollusk.
That's our shell, our little spiral shell that has a little mollusk that we get the purple
from.
Give me the next one.
We're going to fly here.
Oh, get that out of here.
That just causes lethy.
Look, more opium.
Put all that opium in there.
Here's an expression.
Here's an expression.
Right?
Colloquial.
Semna te se sparteno musteria.
That's that.
A holy mystery of your virgin.
Do you understand what the holy mystery of your virgin is?
No, of course you don't.
None of none of we don't understand that.
You haven't been initiated, bro.
Look at the Sophocles told us.
These are the things that you cannot speak.
You cannot explain the mysteries.
You cannot explain the mysteries.
That's what this is.
The holy, the holy mysteries of your virgin.
Yes, they're areta.
They're inexplicable.
Yeah, unspeakable.
Right?
Keep your mouth shut.
I don't know if you love it.
It's an interesting perspective, no?
Yes, sacred virgin, man.
Who are these?
What are these?
Ce se loi.
Oh, they're cochleae.
They are these mollusks, right?
That are we're going to be carvesting the purple from.
And this name, Ce se loi, that's just the name the Lacones use.
Those are who the Laconians.
Those are the Spartans, baby.
Those are Spartans.
Those are those wolf worshiping Spartans.
Don't you love them?
Those people are crazy, dude.
This stuff is starting in Athens.
Athens with the Athena.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You want a meter?
Are you ready?
Hit the next one.
Hit the next one.
Far macones.
Far macones.
Tabafaea.
When I boptoe, I die something.
I die something.
You mean the word baptism?
Baptism is from a drug industry?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
These drugs, like the burning purple, these drugs will be used in ceremonies that are prevalent
in certain groups of people.
And by that, I mean certain strata of society, and they always float to the top.
That's why people are saying, this stuff is more valuable than gold.
Right?
More valuable than gold.
Take your understanding of the material and shove it.
This is musteria.
You don't even realize what kind of gunpowder you're sitting on.
Oh, God.
I love it.
Let's go to the next one.
This is gorgeous.
This is going to give us everything.
What is that?
That's the Kalkian.
That's the person, right?
The Kalkian, the city, Kalkis.
And you can call the woman, Medea, the Medewa.
You can call her Kalkis.
That's what they call her.
But what is, I've got to, I've got to give me, you can go to that one, but give me the
next one, because these two are paired.
Look at this.
Kalkos.
What is it really coming from?
This little spiral creature that they take, the murex, it's called, they take it.
It's got a little secretion.
I've seen it described as mucus collected, and they have to process it, right?
Okay.
Look, this is, Kalkos is Kalkos.
It is that shell.
This is the place where they're working, the purple, and her name means purple.
Her name means purple.
This is a big deal.
The first word out of the library of Herculaneum was purple.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Oh, let's keep going, Chewie.
We've got, we started a little bit late.
So who are the Seikoloi?
Those are the Leistai.
Wait, what?
Did he say, sounded like Leistais to me.
Remember Jesus is yelling in the Garden of Gethsemane.
I'm not Leistais.
Why'd you come out with the big weapons?
Right?
What are the Seikoloi?
They're Leistai.
They're Leistai.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Love it.
These are the child traffickers, right?
Well, okay.
What do the Seikoloi do?
What are the Seikoloi?
This is what the Seikoloi, traffic in.
They traffic in Heitamia, Paedisci.
And then you can see the root, the last word Paedisci.
You know what that is?
That is an underage prostitute, female.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Slave.
The word slave is there.
And it's the word for the slave that is attached to.
It's attached to a household or the functioning of some kind of, you know, operation.
Let's keep going.
Now, for those of you and people keep, because look, nobody in Bible studies.
I'll get to you.
I'll give you a second to give some good brainwashing.
Nobody in Bible studies will know this.
This is why classes laugh at them.
Nobody in Bible studies reads the lexicon of Hissechias, right?
Nobody does.
It's a shame.
But, and that's why I get email from people who say the silly things they say.
Oh, it's just a robber.
It's just a robber.
Me, me, me, me.
It's just a robber.
No.
You have no concept of what you're talking about because you have no access to the language.
You have not embraced Mother Greek.
Your brain will not grow and you will never know the way.
Yeah.
Because you have some sort of offense.
The great mother.
Great doesn't want to have anything to do with you.
For those of you who want to have something to do with this ancient Greek, this incredible,
can you believe this is 50,000 unusual words?
50,000.
Oh, my God.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
It's so, it's glorious and it's mastery.
It's glorious.
And I'm humbled every time.
Every time I'm humbled.
Whenever I gave a paper in classics, I was like, oh, Muse, let me handle this in proper
way, man.
This is hot, hot nuclear, radioactive.
Give me the next one.
Boom.
What is this?
Oh, let's all get enthusiastic, right?
Right?
These are meonians.
I think that's out of order.
I don't think that was the last one, Chewie, because there was a lead up to that.
Let's go back a little bit.
What does that say?
Boom.
Right there.
Put that one up.
Yeah.
So these are the young, these are the young prostitutes that are being trafficked.
Right?
By the lace dye.
Okay.
Give me the next one.
Yeah.
And that hints the connection back.
Thank you, Chewie.
To the sake of low eye.
Right?
That's what we're doing.
Remember that early Greek history is a history of marauding abduction and sales, cruel sales
of humanity.
Yeah.
And the story of Odysseus is the story of a dude who wanders from island to island being
pursued by women who turn him into a drug using sex slave.
Yeah.
Can you believe that?
People are like, oh, I don't distinguish.
Did I read the Odyssey?
No, you're reading about a crazy, but brilliant, but brilliant age where a knowledge of drugs
was particularly coming to a crescendo.
Give me the next one.
Oh God.
It's so lovely.
Let's keep going through these words.
Watch this view.
This is just to act enthusiastic, right?
But I want to, I want you to see the Lydian connection.
Let's hurry up.
This is enthusiasm.
What happens when you become enthusiastic people?
Where are we trying to get in that bronze age civilization?
Where are we trying to get?
We're trying to get possessed by God.
Has anybody been possessed by a God?
No.
I'm going to ask you that very carefully.
Have you been possessed by a God?
That's all I want.
I just, if you and I are sitting here across from each other, my question is, have you
been possessed by a God?
Now if you answer that and you are a monist, then you are not practicing your religion
in accordance with its original practitioners.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Possession.
Next one.
That's where we're going, right?
The oracles.
Don't forget the oracles.
They're all possessed.
They're all possessed.
Why do you think the trafficking has to do with a bunch of Pidey sky?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how the demon is drawn.
That's how the demon is drawn.
Oh, isn't that interesting?
Interesting.
Now, due to the worship of Athena, we guard that virgin.
Yeah.
Isn't that something?
Right?
It's law.
Let's go to the next one.
I know many of you are not worshipers of the great mother, but it's the law.
She sets it up right here.
It is.
That's just more.
I want you to see that my route.
Why?
Because we're talking really about Maya.
You mean we're talking about Maya when we talk about entering ecstasy?
Entering ecstasy?
Yes.
Why?
Because the purple is what gives us the birth.
The purple is what brings that child into this world.
This is that powerful midwifery that is the high tech of the Bronze Age.
It's the high tech.
And Maya is that woman who has that purple tech.
Yeah.
Has that purple tech.
She's the only one who stayed on earth.
Did you notice that?
She's the only one.
I prefer the caves.
Love it.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Why is that?
Maya is right.
Get the next one.
What is this?
My Masasa.
My Masasa.
What are we doing with Maya's route?
We're turning her into Oistresasa.
How do we get to the estrus?
How do we get to the oistris?
How do we get to that place of Mania?
We get there through she who has the purple.
It's a biological scientific chemical thing.
You can't lie.
Chemicals don't lie.
They make excellent evidence.
Let's go to the next one.
Are you ready?
We're with her.
We're with her, right?
Look, here's Maya.
What's Maya?
I want you to notice down at the bottom, she is that nurse.
She's also that one who, that doctor.
I just want you to look at the last word in the sentence, yatros.
That is indicating a physician.
She's the woman's physician, the physician who brings about life.
It's a great physician, Maya.
Here's, wait a minute, Mary Magdalene, how did she get here?
Look at the second line.
Look at the second line.
What's Jesus doing with the Magdalene?
He's casting out the Dymonia.
Next one?
Next one?
Where did we get a Magdalene in all of this?
The Bible scholars will tell you that Magdalene, and this is everybody, okay, you can go onto
any of the sites that you want YouTube, any of them, guarantee you, they're going to say,
Magdalene, is it a maic?
Probably Aramaic.
Do you think so, Bob?
Bob, do you think so?
Aramaic, Bob?
How can I hear a Hebrew?
Somebody's going to say it's Hebrew, right?
You get a whole chorus of religious girls from Hebrew.
It's from Aramaic.
No.
No, it's not.
Ezekius shows us.
It's from Greek.
And what does it mean when Ezekius defines it?
What does he talk about?
He talks about those who shave the head and offer the oral.
Shame on you all for not knowing.
Shame on you all.
Hit the next one.
I love the Gnostic.
I love to step on.
I love to step on Gnostic Magdalene followers.
Remember, Galen says it's an antidote, right?
She is an antidote.
The Sotera is an antidote.
Keep going.
Just wanted to focus, refocus people on that one.
That's why I brought it up.
Here's the Magdal.
Here's the Magdal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Bringing you the oral.
Okay.
That's exactly what it says right now.
It can be translated as to eat or to devour.
Yeah.
To swallow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shaved head.
Why shave?
Why are these people shaving?
For those of you who have been to the Cypriot rites of Adonis, remember, Bacchus always
leads us to Aphrodite, you know, where she sits.
She sits on Cyprus.
She sits on Cyprus.
Oh yeah.
Shave the head.
Shave the head.
Stay with your, stay with your mate.
Is he worthy of it?
I don't know.
How many of you ask that same question?
Well, back then they were saying things like, I don't know, you can give them some of that
poison.
You know what I mean?
Technically.
These are groups of horse marauders.
Right?
Very well fit people, just, you know, healthy, vigorous, smartest.
Oh my God, the drug, the drug knowledge that's coming out of these people is fascinating.
They're using each other.
Oh my God.
They're using each other for drug sources.
Oh God.
Hit the next one.
Let's keep going.
We can't get too far from the Bacchus stuff.
Remember people, here's Ezekius with all of his definitions of these technical terms.
They're involved with the worship of Bacchus.
I want you to see the very bottom one.
Just look at the bottom one.
What is Bacchia?
What is Bacchia?
It's mania.
It's insanity.
Do you wonder why at Menorca they had the hair with the, with the paint in it that would
cause the insanity?
Because these are combos.
When you take that Akinite, you take that Thannasemon, that Deathbringer, and you add
to it the Theriac.
Are you ready?
I'm going to show you linguistically where the Theriac comes from.
Where the beast upon which Lady Babylon is born.
I'm going to show you that, isn't that a lovely position?
Born up, born up by the beast, the Theriac and the Death Enducer.
I'm going to give you the name tonight.
You're so lucky.
You're so lucky.
I'm telling you, Satanic congregation, I'm telling you, you're so, you will not get
this elsewhere.
You will not.
And I hope that you will see the incredible power of these sources.
I want you to hear the dead, smell the dead, make love to the dead.
Let's do that now.
Is that what these drugs do?
Watch.
He's going to say that in the definition.
Go.
The next one.
Oh, what do we do?
Somebody raised a shout to Pion.
Pion.
Every.
Wait.
Who?
Who?
Who?
That's PN.
Right?
That's a song.
Oh, right.
Song coming.
I hear the chorus coming.
This is Apollo.
Somebody say, Hallelujah.
That's what that says in Greek.
Allelok, Santis.
You darn straight.
Give me the next one.
Hallelujah.
I thought somebody's going to say Hebrew.
Come here.
Come here.
You guy who says that's Hebrew.
Here is an ancient lexicon that shows you to have serious problems.
Bring us the soteriakon.
What is the soteriakon?
Remember the Theriakon?
You remember the Theriakon?
That is the beast that you combine with the death inducer.
And here, they have put on the front of it, souse, souse.
This is from the line of Helios.
Those are the people who are historically bringing you the burning purple.
And what does it do?
And what does it do?
Well, look at these.
You hang on.
Bring it back to me.
And then we'll look at these partiers.
They have an exercise program.
What's going on with that?
Let's go to the next one.
I mean, to the one that was before.
Give me.
They didn't know after that.
Boom.
Look at this people on that soteriakon.
Remember that soteriakon is the savioress.
The first savior, she, who is the savior.
What is the soteriakon or the Theriakon?
What is it for?
It's for the ekforah of the dead.
It is given for the sake of the ekforah of the dead.
What is the ekforah?
That's when you and I sneak out into a cemetery.
We dig down and we get great, great grandpa, we pull him out and we look at him in the
face and we see grandpa speak to me, speak to me grandpa, and grandpa comes to life.
This is the resurrection of the dead that you're watching.
You want to know why Christianity is centered around resurrection because it's this mystery
right and you're watching it, you're watching it.
That's kind of the next one.
Is that exciting?
It gives me chills.
I don't know.
Right.
Say something in the comments.
Pionios.
And we're going to check the comments before we get to Pionios.
Now I just said shout hallelujah, yeah, yeah, and I said Pion and I said Apollo and this
says Pionios is Dionysos, is Dionysus.
Every third year, the Oracle of Apollo becomes the Bacchic Oracle.
They call it third time, third time.
Oh, and what happens?
Purgation baby, oracular purgation.
Do you know what those priestesses do?
Let me just lay it out for you in the actuality so you can feel it.
Those priestesses stop and they join their theosos and they go up into the mountains and they
take with them baskets.
What's in those baskets, Alma?
Let's take a peek.
What's in those baskets?
No, it's women only.
What's in those baskets?
Dildos and snakes.
Dildos and snakes.
And they take those out and they become militaristic crazy.
And if you happen to catch some kid, maybe, I don't know, maybe a pimply face redhead,
teenage kid, you catch him out there in the mountains, you know what that group of women
does to him?
Oh, God.
You want to reset yourself?
You want to reset yourself when you're the Oracle and you're guiding the world?
Because that's what the Oracles do.
People come to them and they say, hey, this guy's a tyrant, what do we do?
And they're like, oh, you got to kill him.
All right.
How do they purge these priestesses?
How do those priestesses purge?
Have you ever chased down a pimply-faced redhead?
Have you ever chased him down?
Have you ever pumped him full of drugs?
Because this is what they're doing.
The Codex Walloani, you remember, it has the instructions for how to do this.
Also found from that British, anyway, yeah.
And what do you do when you chase him down and you put all the drugs in him?
You raise his body temperature and you bleed him and all that kind of stuff like that,
so that you can get the right blood, that hunger that hold me, that drive for that blood,
that drive is part of the Bacchic purgation.
And it does something.
It does something.
Wouldn't you love to have a brain scan on these Bacchants?
Now, sometimes it gets out of hand and we have a text that tells us, you know, King
Stone says daughters were into it and they're out doing it and they're uncontrollable.
Can't stop them.
They're not coming down.
They're supposed to do it and they're supposed to come down and they're not coming down.
They're just still doing it.
So somebody gets sent after, they round them up and they give them an antidote, compound
antidote.
Bring them back to their senses, right, and they're all like, oh, right, purgation, purgation.
You cannot have Athana.
You cannot have justice and democracy without Bacchic purgation.
It's how the system works.
It's the genius of Athana, the genius of Athens.
Oh, God, I love it.
It's so sexy.
It's so beautiful.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Hit me with the next one.
Look at this, people.
Pione is what?
Pharmaca Iatrica.
Now, I'm always telling people, these terms are drugs.
These terms are drugs.
Now, Hesechius is telling you these terms are drugs.
These terms are drugs.
But to him, it's not unusual.
It's only unusual to you because you have come through a modest fog of dark ages scum
from a pond full of human sewage, yes, modest human sewage.
What happened?
The reality of what Julian predicted has happened.
We are living in the society that he predicted, and we have moments of renaissance, and those
moments of renaissance are always brought to us by Mother Greek.
If you don't believe me, read Thomas Jefferson.
Yeah, his personal letters.
Take a look at him.
Go.
People should know that anyway, right?
It's on the reading list for Satanic congregation, right?
These are pharmacos.
These are drugs.
Pioneia.
When I am yelling in my ecstasy, hallelujah, what do I have?
What am I performing?
I'm performing rites.
And what are these rites involving?
They're involving farmaca iatrica, those doctoring drugs.
Remember, the worship of Apollo is the worship of the medical doctor.
This is all coming to us through the sun, the great sun, S-O-N, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who is grandpa?
Grandpa is Helios, silly people.
Remember the daughters of Helios that we learned about?
Oh, God.
Those are the women who were keeping the chumps like Odysseus around as sex slaves.
You know what she did?
Cersei, after he went back to Penelope because he was crying on the beach all the time, she's
like, oh, just get out of here, right?
She went and hunted him down.
She went and hunted him down and killed him and raised him from the dead.
Isn't that cool?
Oh, God.
I want to meet this Bronze Age woman.
Where, Chewie, where is this Bronze Age woman?
She's no...
It's something.
It's something inside of the feminine core that can be brought out.
It's something inside.
Oh, God.
Love it.
Love it.
Go to the next.
Yet we're almost finished.
We've got a couple here.
I just want to tell you, I was mentioning the beast.
Just so you can see the connection.
Here's the Theros, that beast, and what are those beasts connected to?
They're connected to Satoriscus, those who were in that satiristic state who have the
satiriasis.
Do you know what that beast was?
The Medea Road.
The Medea Road.
Prometis.
Prometis.
Prometis.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That great eagle.
That great eagle.
She ate his liver.
She ate his liver and took a drug.
The drug of Prometheus.
Do you know the name Prometheus?
It doesn't mean what you think it means.
It doesn't mean what you think it means.
It comes from the Medwa.
It's that vision.
It's that vision that the Medwa possesses.
Isn't that gorgeous?
What happened to this world, these queens?
This is Lady Babylon, and this is the greatest threat.
She is the greatest threat of the apocalypse, Lady Babylon.
That medical access, that purity, that restoration, that purgation.
All of that medicine and genius, that's the enemy.
What came from a woman's mind is the enemy of the post-classical world.
This is the world that the monists took down.
They took it from us, and they destroyed it.
Look at the art that they produce.
Look at the art.
Oh, God.
What's wrong?
I think I need corneal surgery or something again.
Looking to my eyes.
Go to the next one.
We've got just one or two more, and then we're going to bring in Neil.
We're going to bring in Neil.
Oh, look a little bit.
Yep, it's for the raising of the dead.
No, we don't need that.
Give me the next one.
Look at the Saturiscos.
Here, I just wanted you to see the connection to Saturian.
It's the thing that makes you the sader.
That always gets my goat.
Hi, Penelope.
Penelope, how are you doing?
How are you doing?
Concentrate, everybody.
Concentrate.
Take this time.
We're coming around the corner.
How am I doing?
Let me see here.
Oh, my goodness.
I've got to give everybody the whole thing.
Now, let's go quickly.
Everybody, now that you've got Penelope squarely in your vision, let's run through these.
Are you ready?
Let's run through these definitions.
What are your orgies, baby?
They're that intense feeling that you get.
Did you know that religious right is that intense desire that you get, that intense
sexual desire?
Yeah, that's it.
The next one.
Boom.
Sorry.
That's them saying it.
What are we looking for?
We're looking for the Tahira.
Tahira.
Did we skip it?
I thought we skipped it.
These are the things that are involved with the musteria.
The mystery rights hit us with the next one.
What are these things?
They're katharderioi.
They are purificatory sacrifices.
When I say sacrifices, I don't mean sheep.
I don't mean sheep.
Listen, we've started following the way of Cain long before the Hellenistic Septuaget,
the Torah, the Bible was written.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When they say sacrifice, they're talking about fumigations.
Look at this number two there.
It says pharmakon, right?
Drug which affects katharsis.
It's a drug which causes you to purge or it's a drug that causes you to have locheon.
That's important because that's women.
That's what happens when you have a child.
Those are your locale movements.
Look at this next term, epimaneon.
That's your monthly women.
Did you know you have a monthly katharsis and wait a minute, you mean that thing that
happens, that mystery that happens is a healthy purgation?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
If you knew how to use it properly, you'd be already going to the banquets, baby.
You'd be on that island.
That's where we all go, right?
It gives you wings.
That's what it says.
Gives you wings, the purple.
Give me some.
Sign me up for that stuff.
We're going to go quick.
We're going to go quick.
We've got to hurry up here.
What is the hira that we're looking for?
The serpent.
The serpent.
Are you kidding?
The name for many medicines in the Greek pharma, Kapia.
Go to the next one.
You can't get away from the drugs.
Now people, I'm going to give you a definition of a drug.
This definition of a drug, a pharmacon, is not from a dead Victorian.
It's breathful of stale flatus.
This is from antiquity.
Are you ready for this?
What is a drug?
A drug is a sediment.
Some people say it's a synthetic compound which promotes and guards the hira of the living.
Wait, wait, wait.
Say that again.
A drug is a synthetic.
It is a compound with which we, who use it, guard the hira of the living.
Okay, the hira, I see.
And we're looking for the serpents.
We're looking for the serpents.
Okay, you haven't been there.
You haven't been born again.
You know, the ultimate irony of history is that there are millions, millions and millions
of Christians who believe that they are born again.
These are real happenings.
This is not faith.
History is an actual operation.
The initiation causes you to be born again.
You can be Cicero and you can say, you know what, I'm Cicero.
And if you haven't been through this thing, you haven't lived.
Yeah, yeah.
So it's a place to send you, they bring you back, right?
It is the great eagle.
If you understood the sacred name of Rome, you would hear me divulging the mysteries,
but I'm only speaking to those of you who have ears to hear.
Brilliant, brilliant.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Oh, pharma kiss.
What is that pharma kiss?
Well, it's just, you know, it's the female user of the drugs, right?
People translate as sorcerous, right?
That's why we try to show them midwives, right?
Go to the next one.
What do you do when you porphyric something, when you purple something?
You know what it does?
It causes a confusion and a self-examination and darkening.
That's what that says.
Hit the next one.
Well, what are porphyromata?
What are those things?
Those are the, what are the purplies?
The purplies are the little bits, you know, the little bits of the piggies that you give
to the goddesses and sacrifice.
Wait a minute.
What did you just say?
The purplies are the little bits of the piggies that you give and sacrifice to the goddesses.
Has anybody found that road to a leucis?
Yeah.
Has anybody found that?
Give me the, give me the next one.
By the way, those, if you look up that Hoyros, that thing that they're telling, those piggies
that they're telling you, don't tell me.
I didn't warn you.
I didn't warn you because the piggy is something else, right?
And if I were to tell you what the little piggy is, let's see, what's the most scientific
way I can have doing this?
Little pink piggy, sacrifice to the goddesses.
Okay.
That's enough.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
There's only so much.
Do you know why?
Because we're porforantes.
We are purpling.
We're the people who are purpling.
And that's what it says.
What does it say you're doing when you're purpling?
You are cacotec nuntes.
You're using the evil art.
You're using the evil art, right?
Medea is a witch who uses the evil art, and you can use that and get a whole group, a
whole group of sex slaves.
Let's see them.
Let's see them.
We're going to keep going.
We're going to keep going.
What?
Oh, God.
I'm going to dialogue with myself.
Right?
Well, I'm purpling.
Keep going.
I'm going to have some troubling experiences in my head.
Don't worry.
And I'm going to experience the purple death porfure os sanatos.
How many of you want to know what the purple death is?
And that's what the entry says, the purple death.
Oh, God.
It's that blackness.
It's that depth.
It's that place where your mind becomes scrambled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Purple death.
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
I want.
I want to find the purple death.
It's all over the language.
Let's go to the next term, phoenix, phoenix, phoenix.
What?
I don't want to go back to Arizona.
Celia.
Celia.
That's the funny word that we're identifying with phoenix.
What is phoenix?
It's the purple people.
It is the purple.
You talk about Phoenicians only because of this Greek word for purple.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Once again, it's impregnated cloth with the purple.
That's the way we go about it.
That's why it's in the imperial families, people.
We found it.
We found it.
We just dug it up.
Bring it.
It was in the bathhouse.
You know why?
Because there's a place you put the purple.
Let's go to the next one.
Go to the next one.
Hit me.
Oh, we're on fire.
We're on fire.
We only got a couple more.
We're done.
We have you.
Just a few things that nobody has ever seen, cover on, cover the dirt.
Guga.
Guga.
Who is Guga?
Guga is Athena, Enhorios.
Enhorios.
Who is she?
She's a rustic Athena, the rustic immortal girl.
Odysseus washes up on this island, falls asleep.
And he's woken up by a pack of young girls who are leading their mistress around, their
princess mistress.
And she is ready, getting ready for marriage on that age.
So she's 13, 14-ish, and here's Odysseus laying on the beach, right?
And she saves him because he stands up and tells her, oh, my God, you must be a divinity.
Which divinity?
Do we have standing here in front of us?
Right?
He's covering himself with a branch.
Right?
And she's bold.
She's bold because that's how they were.
She was bold.
And she lets him know.
Let's him know.
Yeah.
That's nice.
Thanks for the compliment.
And then guides him to safety.
And who is it that sent that 14-year-old girl?
Who is it that sent her?
Another 14-year-old girl named Athena.
Wait, she's divine?
Yeah.
And she follows Odysseus around the whole time.
She follows him around, whether he's suffering, whether he's being shielded by powerful Bronze
Age women on islands who are involved in the purple, yeah, or whether he ends up back
at home and one of them is using the purple death to bring him to a place and pull him
out of it to open up his mind.
I wish they had some brain scans on Odysseus.
When Cersei did that to him, I'd love to see what it was doing to his brain.
Oh, God.
Hit me with the next one.
Let's keep going.
That was Athena.
And I want to give you an unusual now.
Title for Dionysus, Bracias.
Bracias.
Now, the contest is, you figure out where that comes from.
Is it Laconian?
What is it?
Is it Dorian?
Is it some kind of regional thing?
Is it Pulaski?
Is that Pulaski in roots?
That's the kind of stuff we can find out.
Look at this.
Who is the Lae-i-anera?
She is the one.
Now, notice the root for Leistace is right here in the beginning, Lae-i-anera.
And what does she do?
She makes the men to engage their desire for intercourse with the women.
That's what that says.
That's what that says.
Who is she?
Who is the Lae-i-anera?
She is the procurus.
She is the one in this trade of the Leistai.
She's the one who sets up, gets the action going, get those aphrodisiacs.
Who do you think knows about all the aphrodisiacs?
It's the Lae-i-anera who knows that stuff.
Once you've been Christed and you're out there with your Gleine, and who knows what
his name is?
It could be Matthew.
It could be Luke.
Who knows?
It could be all sorts of different things.
It could be Peter.
It could just be a kid, you know what I mean?
Once you're out there with your Gleine, and that Gleine is producing you the communion
that is both the Theriac and the antidote, yeah, you better watch out.
You better watch out.
That stuff will bring you to a place where your brain will open up and you'll understand
what everything is, the being.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
And it's developed by a woman using a woman's body.
Using a woman's body.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Give me the next one.
That's the people we should be worshiping.
You know what I mean?
What is that Saikoi?
It's a place where the aphebes get knackered, get naked, and exercise, right?
Don't be embarrassed.
The way it is, yeah, teenage wrestling naked children, right?
It's a part.
It's a part of a society that ultimately produced a dude who was crucified after getting arrested
in a public park with a naked boy, screaming, I'm not one of these lace days.
And that's your reality.
Welcome to it.
We got one last slide.
Oh, what did I get?
What's this?
Do we do that one?
Holy mackerel.
Yeah.
No, this is the place where they put, they were going to put Odysseus in there too.
They put all those men in there, right?
And they got them all naked.
How many of those guys got castrated?
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's the Bronze Age.
Now, what I'm going to tell you before I bring on Gnostic is I want you to know that
Gnostic is going to be, yeah, it's going to be doing an interview.
I don't think he would mind.
I should have asked him before, but I wanted to bring up Danny Jones.
I wanted to bring up Danny Jones because Danny Jones interviewed me and he's going
to have that.
It's going to be released.
And I want people to be able to tell me what they, you know, engage in dialogue and I want
them to see it.
So Neil is going to get his chance as well.
Neil is going to get his chance as well.
Now I want to ask Neil, looking at this dictionary, go ahead, bring him in.
Bring him first.
Let's bring him in.
Say, say hello.
Go ahead.
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
I got you.
I got you.
So Neil, I just want to tell you, I know you're prepping and you're getting ready to go and
you're being inundated with sources.
Can you just tell these, can you just tell this satanic congregation?
Can you tell them ever since you got the Loeb classical library with all of these authors?
How have you opened up?
I mean, you're just, there's a ton of sources.
Tell us about, you don't have to tell us particulars, but is it just me or are there not like an
uncountable number of incredible sources out there in ancient Greek?
You know, when I was younger, I always used to think that the Bible was so huge, all these
books in the Bible, there's so many Old Testament books, there's so many New Testament books,
there's even the Apocryphal books, there's so many, there's hundreds.
And then I thought like, for some reason, this is like, I don't know if I was taught
this or was it, I was in the impression I was under that on the classical side, it's
just Homer, it's maybe Hesiod, maybe some Ovid, Virgil, it's probably like 10 or 15
classics.
And then you start to learn throughout the years that the Bible books is not even a
drop in the bucket compared to the amount of Greek and Latin classics that exist.
Only within a couple hundred years, we'll say 500 BC up until second century, the third
century, the common era, even if you just took that little era.
We're talking thousands of times more text, thousands of times more text than what we
have in the Bible.
So that's just trying to, if you want to wrap your head around how deep it goes, how much
stuff is untranslated, how many mundane texts, how many medical texts, how many poems, you
got epods, you got echologues, you have poetry, you have hymns, you have orphic fragments,
you have philosophical treatises, epistles, anything you can name, there's just so much.
You can't even explain it, it's hard to even wrap your head around, it's like trying to
compare the sun to the earth, it's like you can't even wrap your head around how small
the earth is compared to the sun, you have to like look at it with a model to understand
it, it's just crazy.
Where are you going?
Tell us what you're working on right now, please, because you're a documentarian and
you're causing a stir.
I heard you got banned from somebody's ex, tell us where you're going with your research
and stuff.
Look, somebody made a video and they said in their video that they were refuting some
tiktokers video comparing Jesus to other dying and rising gods and this person who's
an award-winning SBL scholar came along and said, this is complete and utter nonsense,
none of this is true.
So all I did, I didn't even say anything, all I did was post a couple sources.
Hey, look, Plutarch says that herpocrates was born around the winter solstice.
This person says, Epiphanius says that Ion is born by a virgin on January 6th.
He also says Deutera, and I just gave a couple sources.
That's all I did.
Blocked.
Done.
Get away from me.
Blocked.
No worries.
This is a public-facing, this is a person who's winning awards for public-facing scholarship
and as soon as you throw something back at him that he doesn't like, you're blocked.
True story.
I have the screenshots.
I'll talk more about it later, but let's just leave it at that for now.
Okay.
Let's leave it at that.
Now, where is your research going?
What frontier are you uncovering?
Well, I have some slides and you know how we do this.
Whenever you have me on, we don't plan this out.
I don't even know what you're going to talk about.
And I just sit here during this hour and as you talk, I just go, oh, here reminded me
of this source.
I'm going to pull up the source.
And by the time the 45 minutes to an hour is up, I have a whole slideshow ready to go.
All of this is stuff that I gathered in the last 45 minutes, but I think the way to answer
that question is if we go through this because it has to do with what you were talking about
with the Promethea and the Soteria.
So if you allow me, if you want me to continue just a couple slides and we can get back to
the question.
Is that cool?
Do your thing.
Do your thing.
Go back and listen.
All right.
Cool.
So here's my slides.
By the way, first thing I want to say off the rip, I'm on mention that there was the
ancient mysteries that was everything to these ancients.
Salvation came from being initiated and taking the drugs called Kaikyan or Promethea, which
I'll get into in a minute.
And after you had your experience or psychedelic awakening, you no longer fear death.
This was a reality of the ancient world.
This is the model that the Christian Universalist Church was trying to replace.
So what we have here is an image dug up here in Herculaneum, one of the new ones, I think,
and it's Demeter Isis hyphenated, Demeter Isis hyphenated, the central Soteria of the Ellusinian
Mysteries.
If you don't know what the Ellusinian Mysteries are, these are the biggest mystery religion
of the ancient world where people would just like how Muslims from India or Bangladesh
will travel all the way in pilgrimage to Mecca to see the Holy Mosque that Kaaba.
That's how the ancients were for the Ellusinian Mysteries.
Depending on where you lived, you lived in Egypt, you lived in Gaul, you lived in Syria.
If you wanted to be saved by the Soteria, the Saviouress, you had to go to Ellusis and
get initiated.
And everyone wanted to do this.
There's a story about a man from India.
Actually, you know, it was eight men from India, and only three of them made it.
They traveled all the way from India to get some Athens to get initiated, and a bunch
of them died on the way, but three of them made it there.
The one dude, after he got initiated, he was so blown away by his experience, by the spiritual
awakening that he had, that he no longer feared death, he jumped into a fire and killed himself
and did his life.
So that's how powerful this whatever was going on there was.
So I just want to point out something about this goddess right here.
Notice she has this crescent moon on her head with a star Venus inside of it.
She's holding a cystrom and a cornucopia.
She's got the world on her feet.
And you know, obviously some of this might remind you of how they portrayed the image
of Lady Babylon in Revelation with the moon at her feet.
And she's also clothing golden.
You might argue that she's clothed with the sun right there, right?
But that's the second century Soteria, and this is actually before the second century.
This is 79 AD or older.
Anyways, I just wanted to show you guys this because it's going to matter for what I'm
about to get into.
The next slide I have is an inscription of Sabaeus all the way down in Egypt.
What the hell is he doing down there?
Isn't Sabaeus a Thracian God?
Well, I'm trying to highlight because when people try to tell me that there's no way
Sabaeus can influence Yahweh, he's a Thracian God.
And I'm telling you, look, down in Egypt, there are inscriptions of Dionysus Sabaeus
also identified with Isiaca Isis, a male version of Isis.
And it says, they called him the Epecus, the listening to prayer, which is one of his titles,
Zeus Helios, Megas Curios Sabaeus, having authority over Lord and Master and Guardian.
All right?
So just trying to show you how important Sabaeus was to people in the ancient world.
As we continue, I want to show you something here.
Now, ignore the text.
If I can cover it, I will.
Actually, I could.
I just want you to look at this.
This is from the oldest copy of the Septuagint that's physically alive today.
Now, what do I mean by that?
Well, the Septuagint, apparently, according to the story, was created around 270 BC, something
like that.
But that doesn't mean we have physical copies from 270.
We lost all that.
This is from the first century BC.
I think it's like dated to like 100 BC, 90 BC, something like that.
Very old, very hard to preserve text out of that old.
But what do you see in this text?
Because in the copy that I have, in the Breton's, the Breton copy of the Septuagint, there is
no, yeah, oh, it's, it's a Curios, Curios, Curios, Curios, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord.
Well, turns out that the versions that we have in our possession are, in fact, late Christian
Bibles, so they sort of edit the text over time and they unify them.
So any, they want to change any differences between manuscripts, they unify them into
one coherent church text, which is, you get the codex synodicus, the codex Aleksandrakus
and the codex Vaticanus.
Those are the three oldest from the fourth century or later.
We don't have any Bibles before that, by the way.
But this, this manuscript, you can see Iota, Alpha, Omega.
Yeah, oh, what, what?
Yeah, oh, the Yahweh.
Well, this is what they think.
All right, I'm just going to read this, but don't, don't, let me just read this for you.
Play it, it says the Paleo-Hebrew divine name Yahweh, rendered in Koine Greek as Yah-oh.
That's, that's, that's the consensus, right?
Well, wait a minute, though, is it really, is that really what happened?
Is that really the case?
Because the Chaldean oracles says that Dionysus or Bacchus was called by the
Chaldeans, Yah-oh.
Phinephinesian tongue, frequently called Sabaoth, Sabaoth, the seven poles, the
demiarchos.
So wait a minute, now we have conflicting stories.
This is the translation, or is this really the name of the God?
Is, so let's just continue.
Let's just, I'm not even saying, I'm no theories yet.
Did I even say that I didn't even make an argument?
All I'm doing is I'm just showing you stuff, right?
I'm letting you decide.
Here we go.
We have Diodorus of Sicily.
All right.
The Diodorus has this interesting passage that I want to read to you guys.
And he says, I'm just going to read a couple of the words from the Greek where he
says, Arianios, there is, there are two stories to an Agathon demon.
And then he says, down here, he says, Zelemaxan, who is Staios?
Ten coin and Hestian, Musaenton, Yah-oh.
It's down here.
My, my mouse is on a different spot.
Yah-oh.
Huh?
What is that?
What is he talking about?
Well, here's what it says in English.
It says, Among the Arianes, Zarathustra claimed that the good spirit gave him his
laws, and among the Getai, who represent themselves to be immortal.
Zelemaxis asserted the same thing.
By the way, Zelemaxis means Xemile's son.
Xemile's son, look this up.
Don't, just don't take my word for it.
The, the etymology of the word Zelemaxis is Dionysus.
All right.
Then it says, nice.
I like that image.
Then it says, Among the Jews, it says, Among the Eudaios, right over here, Among
the Eudaios, Musaenton, Yah-oh.
It says, Among the Jews, Moses referred to this laws as the God invoked as Yah-oh.
There's no, there's only three letters there.
So now we, now we're looking at, we got Diodorus comparing Dionysus to Yah-oh.
We got the Chaldean oracles comparing Dionysus to Yah-oh.
We have Sabaeus, who is Dionysus, all the way down in Egypt.
Let's keep going.
Let's see what else we got.
Here's from, this is from, this is from Microbius.
And he says in the same verse, the Orphians, the Orphics, called Eubolia of good council,
point to this God as having been provided for the plans of the mind of born of conception.
The authors think that the mind of the world is the sun, for which the principal understanding
flows into men.
They believe that the sun stood before the merit of good plan.
Orpheus clearly pronounces the sun in this verse.
Helios and Dionysus are the same God.
One Zeus, one 80s, one Helios, one Dionysus.
And this is what they call this God, Yah-oh.
So, whoa, now the evidence is starting to tilt in another direction.
You know what I mean?
We got this God called Yah-oh, who's linked with both Dionysus and Apollo.
What else do we got?
Let's continue.
Now, this is the, I'm going to take a little detour, but I'm going to go back to, to that
Svesi stuff.
This is called the Met, because while Ammon was talking, he mentioned the Promethea drug.
Sometimes I, when you, if you're watching him and you don't know him like I do, he, he's,
in his mind, he thinks you understood what he said there, but you might not have understood
what he said.
I'm going to bring the sources just to back him up for a second.
This is real.
This has not just made up shit.
Apollonius of Rhodes in the third century BC says that Medea took a magic ointment
from her box.
This salve was named after Prometheus, a man only to smear it on his body after
propitiating the only begotten maiden, Hecate, with a midnight offering to become
invulnerable by sword or fire.
And for that day to surpass himself and strengthen Derrick, it first appeared in a
plant that sprang from the blood-like ecore of Prometheus in his torment, which
the flesh-eating eagle had dropped on the spurs of Caucasus.
The flowers which grew into twin stalks on Cupid High were the colors Corkian
Saffron, while the root, rootcutters, DMT heads out there.
You guys know exactly what I'm talking about now.
While the root looked like the flesh that did just bad have been cut.
By the way, anyone who knows anything about DMT knows that the roots that you
have to buy to make DMT are always dark red purple, like flesh.
So this is, everything's lining up for me right here.
This is mind-blowing shit right here.
To make the ointment, Medea, it says, and then the juice, dark sap like
mountain oak, to make the ointment, Medea, clothed in black in the gloom of night,
had drawn off this juice in a Caspian shell after bathing in several perennial
streams and calling seven times on brimo, Hecate, nurse of youth, brimo, night
wanderer of the underworld, queen of the dead, the dark earth shook and rumbled
underneath the titan when it was cut.
And Prometheus himself grown in anguish of his soul.
By the way, Propitius, Propitius in Latin in the first century BC also
cites this magical herb sprung from the blood of Prometheus.
And then there's two more sources, Seneca in his text called Medea talks
about this magical herb.
All right, you could read this for yourself.
Pause the screen at any time you like.
Come back to this video later, but I'm not going to read the whole thing.
And then Valerius flakus, flakus in the first century AD also talks about this drug.
We have four primary sources that all corroborate each other.
And it reminds me, it reminds me of the obsession, the middle ages, the dark ages
of people finding the holy grail.
We've got to find the holy grail with the blood of Christ in it.
This was already a thing people were doing before Christianity was even a
thought in anyone's mind.
People were looking for the blood and the cup of Prometheus by Medea.
This is a real thing.
I just proved it by four primary sources stretching 400 years, all talking
about this magic cup that Medea produced with the blood of Prometheus.
By the way, he was killed in the Caucasus, right where Medea lived.
Here we go.
Dionysus and his alter ego.
I'm going back to the Sabazian concept.
Dionysus with his alter ego, the child Yacos.
All right.
So I'm going to change my script.
Well, actually, let me think.
I don't want to do this.
I'm going to hold this thought for now.
I want you to keep this, put a little tab on this.
I'm going to come back to this.
There's Dionysus as the father and the son rolled into one.
That's what we have to take away from this.
Dionysus and Yacos.
Yacos is always the name of the divine child.
Sometimes it's called Zagreus, but Yacos is another name for that.
Let's just put that aside for now.
Prometheus standing among the satyrs.
See this?
What is going on here?
Wait a minute.
I thought Dionysus is the one who stands among the satyrs.
This is probably just a one-off thing, right?
This doesn't happen that often, right?
Here's another one.
Prometheus holding the fire, standing with his satyrs.
What?
Another one.
Prometheus, 5th century BCE, standing amongst the satyrs.
Again, another one.
Which one is this?
I don't know what date this.
3rd century BCE, I'm not really sure.
There he is again with the satyrs.
What's going on?
Why is Prometheus with the satyrs?
What?
So something to think about.
Here's Prometheus standing between Heracles and Caster.
This is a Truscan you can tell.
Anyone who knows a Truscan you can tell.
By the way, that's Ivy and berries.
That's a Dionysian symbol.
No, Ivy and berries, Dionysus all day long.
There's no other god that has Ivy and berry.
That's Prometheus.
Look how Christ-like he looks in this picture.
Look, where's his cup?
Look at, he's got his arms wide open and everything.
He's dying for everybody.
He's being pecked.
He's being, what do you call it?
He's being, what does it say in Isaiah?
You know what I'm talking about, where they stab him.
Pierce, he's being pierced.
They pierced the Lord.
They pierced the Lord to the concept.
He's being orylated.
Yes, the magic cup is being created.
That's the drug, man.
All right, here's another one.
Another Truscan image of the god Prometheus looking all Christ-like.
With his arms up, dying and his blood is being basically taken.
By the way, this is the poppy goddess.
And you might be thinking, that's a rare occurrence.
Well, no, all over the Minoan world, all over the Mycenaean world.
And in Eleusis, we find this image of this goddess holding poppy plants.
Sometimes they're on her head.
As we can see, this is from the Mycenaean period.
This is Bronze Age, baby.
Look it, there's your Stour Venus.
There's your Crescent Moon.
That's Demeter, baby.
It's the goddess I started off with on purpose.
So I wanted you to see the same symbols in the Bronze Age are all the way in the
Roman period, the same goddess, Isis Demeter, the savior, the Soteteria,
which is a woman, as Amon pointed out.
He's right.
Here's more.
There's a whole bunch of these poppy goddesses popping up.
Poppy goddesses, drugs, guys.
I'm telling you, you guys think this is all crazy.
This was normal shit in the ancient world.
Here's another one.
It's the poppy goddess with poppy on her head.
Now, one more thing I want to show you guys before I'm done.
I'm going to stop sharing this.
I'm going to share one more thing.
Because Clement of Alexandria talks about this.
This is what he says.
Clement of Alexandria, in the exhortation of the Greeks, says the following.
He says, I'm just going to read the highlighted part right here, where it says
Svesion, Goon, Musterion, Sumbalon, Toys, Mumenios, Odia, Colpu, Theos.
Dracon de estin utos, translates to, for the God who passes through the bosom is
the symbol of the mysteries of the Svesians to those being initiated in the dragon.
Let me repeat that again.
The God who passes through the bosom, he's talking about Svesius.
Svesius, also called Yaho, you got to get that imprinted into your brain.
Svesius, hyphenated Yaho, is the God who passes through the bosom is the symbol of
the mysteries of the Svesians to those being initiated into the dragon.
All right, let's keep going.
The next thing I want to show you guys is, in the Thracian religion, there is a God,
by the way, this is where Svesius is from, Svesius and Zelmoxis.
And there's another title for this God, Svesius, Zelmoxis.
But just to shorten it up, they call him Zis.
Zis or dis, father dis, pater dis, dis, pater, the underworld God, right?
Zagreus Dionysus.
And I encourage you, I know I'm looking through Wikipedia right now,
but I'm just trying to really quickly go over this real quick.
And I encourage you all to look into this yourself.
See how they cite Microbius?
As I already mentioned, it's Microbius.
The son and Liber, or once the same, in Thrac.
Apollo and Dionysus, watch this.
Where is it?
Zis, okay, so Zis basically is the mixture of, there it is, Dionysus.
The Dionysian Zis, the cathonic and fire aspects of Zis.
Underworld, cathonic, dark, Dionysus.
But then we have the Apollonian Zis.
By the way, the reason I'm bringing this up,
people think Nietzsche is making this shit up.
Like Nietzsche just philosophically drew up some random shit about Dionysus and Apollo.
He's not Nietzsche.
The problem is that the classicists and Bible scholars of the time period
were not caught up to Nietzsche.
Nietzsche was way ahead of them.
He's better than them at their own jobs.
So we have evidence of an Apollonian Zis, the heavenly sun god,
and then there's the Dionysian Zis.
But it's two faces of the same god, as Carl Ruck points out.
All right, last thing I want to go to, two things I want to go to.
Indo-European vocabulary, right?
So if I look up this, so you mentioned the word sec, right?
Sec, and if you look up, where is it?
Libel, libation.
So the oldest words in Indo-European, which is, by the way, this is what Pulaskian is.
The root word for soma and haoma, which is where we get these psychedelic drugs from,
kaikion, comes from a Pulaskian word that means libate or poor or invoked.
It also has, it also is connected to the word hyig, sacrifice.
Hagios, holy.
Yahios, religious worship.
So what am I getting at?
Basically, psychedelics itself is the origin of religion.
How mind-blowing is that?
The words in Pulaskian that have to do with drugs, soma, kaikion, haoma, the magical drink,
the Scythians had their own version of it called like the homa or hyma or something,
and something along those hyma or something.
But it's all psychedelics and it's all related to the word for holy.
The word for holy is the same word for psychedelic drug in Pulaskian.
That alone should blow your mind.
And the last thing I got to show you guys, and then I'm going to go back to Amon's question,
is the following.
The Anachariotic song, because it all comes back to Bacchus and Venus, right?
At the end of the day, it's all comes back to these two gods, the Demeter Isis goddess with the
horns and the star.
And this other god, Dionysus or Ya'o or whatever, Apollo, whatever's going on,
that the god who's called the pion or he's called the Dithyram.
It's music, two different titles for the same son of god figure.
As Clement points out, this god who's both father and son rolled into one,
he's got an alter ego called Ya'os, Ya'o.
Well, the Anachariotic song is actually where we get our American anthem from.
Listen to this.
So this song that everyone knows is not what you think.
If you actually look up the lyrics to this song, as you can see on the screen,
I'm going to try to zoom in if I could, it says,
with Bacchus and Venus, the Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.
That is the lyrics of the song that you all know as the American anthem.
Thomas Jefferson set up a Luciferian nation to go back to Athens and Rome.
And that's where we're at today.
That's what I got.
Oh my god.
I am so active right now.
I want to punch something and yell America.
You know what I mean?
That's gorgeous.
I love the fact that, look what you did.
You resurrected that chap.
You resurrected Jefferson.
Oh my god.
By the way, they changed the lyrics after the Civil War.
So almost a hundred years later, they changed the lyrics to that song.
That song was not the national anthem.
That song was called the Anachariotic song.
It's a song about Bacchus and Venus rolling to one as one.
They're honoring Bacchus and Venus.
Yeah.
That's the song, Topping Jefferson and Thomas Payne all bump in their heads.
Greek lyric poetry, baby.
Right?
All in that mother Greek.
And Tom Jefferson in his personal letters, he wrote little ditties, little songs in Greek.
And it's like, oh my god, this guy was, he was genius, brah.
He was not only functional as a classical philologist, but he was able to create within the medium.
And that's, that's remarkable.
I have total kudos.
Total kudos for Tom.
Nice job, Tom.
Now you said some big stuff there and I want to point out.
So please, you made a point, Neil, out of saying religion came out of drugs.
And you used language to prove it.
Not, you didn't say like, you know, this is my theory that those people were all droggies.
Man, come on.
Right?
No, you didn't do that.
You said, look at the language.
You know, look at the, did you like the Poppy Queen?
One of the things about the Poppy is to the canisters.
They have canisters, little pots shaped like the opium poppy that they make the slits in
that drools out this white elixir of heaven.
Yeah.
And so you take that, you know what I mean?
Could take it over the lotus seeders.
They'll tell you.
And any who, so they had all of these little pots that you would have opium within.
And you could buy those in the marketplace, right?
There's a huge trade.
They find down ships with this stuff on it, right?
It's like, oh, okay.
Cypress is big, right?
It's big into the opium.
And you're like, the first thing people are is they jump right away to the extreme.
Remember, they're using these chemicals within balance, right?
So she's not just on opium.
I'm sorry, but your lady is not just on opium.
That queen that we all bow to, you know what I mean?
That we take from that sacrifice, right?
We take that moment of understanding of being killed and reborn.
Potion.
It's a special potion.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We take of it.
We partake of it.
Isn't it?
Oh, God.
I mean, it's important.
All the stuff that you're bringing out, that's important.
Religion came from drugs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I want to emphasize this.
Because in the elbows of any amisters,
it wasn't just some music festival that hippies went to.
So you can, for Ascalus was initiated.
Plato was initiated.
Augustus was initiated.
Cleopatra.
Julia Domna.
The mother of Julia Caesar.
Hadrian.
Antinous.
Marcus Aurelius.
Julian the Apostate.
You name it.
And by the way, even, it doesn't have to be the elbows of any mysteries.
Even older than that are the Samotharation Mysteries.
You were talking about Samotharace earlier.
The Samotharation Mysteries held initiations every year,
and they would do these ritual marriages.
And guess who met there?
Philip of Macedon met Olympius.
At this time, Alexander wasn't born yet.
But obviously, well, let me just tell you this.
Olympus, Olympius was the princess of Epirus,
which is the western coast of Greece.
Philip was the prince of Macedonia,
the northern rough areas of northern, almost in Thrace.
And they were just princes and princesses.
They weren't in control of anything yet.
And they met at the initiation ceremony
of the Samotharation Mysteries.
Why am I even bringing that up?
Because look what came from that bondage.
They produced a child that went on
to conquer the world and spread Hellenism everywhere.
And it's like that came out of people being initiated into the mysteries.
Isn't that great?
She had intercourse.
Please don't forget.
She had intercourse with Ammon.
Yep. By the way, Philip stopped and even
know if it was his own son.
And when Alexander went to Siwa,
when he appeared to the Oracle of Ammon,
he was told, you're home.
This is your return home.
You are my son.
He was told he was the son of God.
He was the son of Ammon.
I'm just saying what the sources say.
You could believe what you want.
That's what the sources say.
Yeah. He also mistreated the Oracle there.
Let it be noted in history that Alexander mistreated the Oracle
and forced her to prophesy on a day that was not holy.
And she said, fine.
And prophesied that he was going to die shortly.
And he did.
And everybody was like, hey, see what happens
when you mess with the oracles?
As soon as his fate was up and his job was done, he was gone.
Yeah. Those witches are protected, brah.
It's the throne of Satan.
Love it.
Okay. I want to ask what you think.
I want your opinion, Neil, on the find announced today
that we found the purple.
Isn't that nice? Glorious.
What do you think about that?
I knew it.
I knew it was a matter of time before we found it.
I'm not surprised.
I'm happy about it.
But I'm not surprised because it's all over the sources.
I just showed you four of them.
You know, they cut up these roots.
They mix it with venoms and blood and all types of mixed.
They add all types of shit to it.
Yeah.
At the base, it's roots.
It's venoms.
It's poppy.
It's some sort of milk.
They're adding all types of mushrooms in there.
It's a potion, but it always comes out purple.
That's that texture from the roots.
It comes out like a blood red purple.
Even the Christians were doing this, as I've shown before,
and I will show again, I'm showing this to Danny when I talk to him.
The sources that say that they were doing Eucharist
with adding purple to the wine and making psychedelics.
People have psychedelic experiences where they were to meet.
Jesus would come down and talk to them.
That's the Holy Spirit right there, the purple.
Did they walk around with the stain of the purple?
Purple stains the lips.
Is there?
Yeah.
Just like Heracles dogs, right?
Just doing the same thing.
It's gorgeous.
Now, you mentioned Medea and you had your different,
four different sources.
In those sources, she is taking out,
by the way, they mentioned Pulaskians.
All those sources talk about Pulaskians.
Because we know that those are our, you know,
ancients.
If we're ancient Greeks, those are our ancients.
Yeah.
And in those, in that drug use that is associated with Medea herself,
she is taking the drug from her colpus or her senus in Latin.
She's taking it from her vagina.
And Dr. Ruck wrote about this in a recent publication
about these, you know, the vaginal source.
And there's other examples of it with Penny Royal,
and it's associated with Apollo, etc.
It's all the oracular mystery.
And so we've got to give Medea credit for having been that,
you know, ground zero of the drug production.
I think it's great that they found the purple.
And of course, right?
Isn't that, of course, hurry up and get that thing analyzed
and figure out exactly what's going on.
They're finding so much, so much.
What did you think?
I love the fact that you brought in that the thing,
the mosaic was that from Herculaneum?
Oh, God.
Yeah, it was either plaster mosaic.
I'm not sure, but it was fresco, fresco.
It's a fresco.
That thing was gorgeous.
That's absolutely gorgeous.
Did you notice that she's got the moon horns of Isis?
And everybody asks, why does Moses have horns?
Why does Moses have horns?
Because people along the way have picked up the Orphic Vox
and have been able to transmit those images to push them forward.
So, yeah, oh, I love it.
I love it.
It was a lot of, yeah, it was a lot of goodness.
Okay, okay.
What else do you have to say about?
I mean, congratulations on you going to interview with Danny Jones.
I hope you don't mind me telling people that.
But what's happening?
It's going down for sure.
Yeah, good.
And you're prepping for that.
You're prepping for that.
Can you just tell Satanic Congregation,
you started looking at the drugs in Celsus.
Is it just a few drugs that they had or did they have a lot?
A lot.
A lot of them are named after gods.
And you have to wonder, Ammoniacum and Serapium,
all these different drug names with different gods in them.
And you have to wonder, what was in these?
And he's talking about, Celsus is talking about,
these are our combinations of different substances being combined
that interact with each other.
They're doing science back then.
And we talk about, we talk about Parmenides and Empedocles
and the Italian Greeks and Magna Graecia,
down in southern Italy and Syracuse.
Our communities is down there,
and they're producing these ritual incubations.
They have these, they're like many, many hospitals,
actually, if you really think about it.
And they're dedicated to Apollo, Apollo Ulus, to be exact.
Apollo the Healer, Apollo the Medical Healer,
that's what it means.
Apollo the Medic, it's a medical center
where they would take the sickly
and they would give them whatever the drugs are.
Celsus lists as a bunch of them.
So does Galen, you could find lists as thousands of these names.
Thousands of these names, thousands.
And they would put them under incubation.
They'd put them under an anesthetic.
And they would report, they would come back,
and they would be healed.
And they would come back and say, I was in Hades,
and I met Pluto, and I met Persephone.
And they told me this, and the doctor would write down,
thank you for your input.
But we'll put that in our resources.
And that's how they conducted research back then.
Crazy shit, man.
I love it.
I love it.
Yeah, it was a project to send people beyond
and then retrieve them back.
And what kind of information?
It's like sending out a probe.
But by the time that you have these really professional
priestly guilds that are using very specific drugs,
and they have very specific symbols,
and it always has something to do with the venom,
kind of like the primary toxin that they're centered around using.
It's those.
And by the way, Medea talks about mixing the toxins, too.
These are multi-toxic components, right?
Seven.
There's seven in her formula for the venoms.
So, you know, this is a really complex pharmacology.
It makes you wonder what happens when you put together
seven different venoms and use them.
I'm really glad that you showed people these sources and said,
you know, sometimes he says something that, you know,
you don't think he's basing it on reality.
But I am.
I'm just bringing you the text.
Diogenes, the cynic says that Medea invented baptisms.
She invented a type of ritual baptisms
that would heal people's bodies.
This is what he says.
And the people in Corinth and Athens,
they call themselves baptize, baptists.
So, you already had a ritual.
You already had a sotaria.
You already had salvation.
You had baptisms.
You had anointing, Christing.
You had all Eucharist, you know, eating the bread,
which was representative of Demeter, the grain goddess,
and drinking the wine, representative Dionysus, the blood.
And don't forget.
The mysteries were all there.
All Christianity does is come along and say,
well, we're going to corporatize this,
and we're going to take away all the naughty stuff and just
take the EEG for everybody.
That's what they did.
They took the mystery and they took all the magic out of it,
dumbed it down, and they universalized it.
That's what Christianity does.
It's the mysteries were already all laid out.
It was already there.
Think about this.
Your average Christian is looking for an afterlife,
but has never actually seen it.
So, they are still incredibly afraid of dying, incredibly.
I don't care what kind of face you put on.
Once you have been there and been brought back,
you don't have any.
There's no question about it.
Like you said, you lose your fear of death.
They said that about these people.
That's why Jesus is saying,
I'll give you these thanosemoi, these death inducers,
and it won't harm you.
It won't harm you, right?
He's trying to put people into those initiations
that he's doing.
And he's doing it with his apostles, those kids.
And he's getting that right through their galene.
Right?
And you say, oh, wait a minute, that's gross.
Yeah, it is.
And that's why they wanted to crucify him.
But it's in perfect alignment with all of the pharmacology.
It's perfect alignment with all of the plants
and the venom that they're using.
So, people are going to discover this.
They're going to discover it.
And Jesus is going to be declared the biggest historical criminal
of all time.
Unless people change, they're like, it's okay.
That Jesus Christ was arrested with a naked boy.
Right?
It's okay.
Does it matter?
Would it matter to you?
If you're thinking about Dan,
if I'm sitting there having a conversation,
by the way, what you did tonight, Neil,
you ought to take some of that to Danny and show him that.
You're going to blow somebody out of the water.
If you and Dan were to get in conversation,
hey, Dan, let me show you some sources that are around the sources.
Isn't it funny how bringing more sources to the discussion
is somehow bad?
Suppose they're ignoring all that stuff.
It's not good.
I can call it dogmatists just for bringing more sources to the table.
Right.
And it's just crazy how you can think of the way they teach people
as public-facing academics,
to only show you the sources that they want you to know
so that they can sort of formulate the narrative
and what they want you to think of.
And then it's like, for them,
they think it's dangerous for people like you and me
to bring more sources and say, look, wait a minute,
don't necessarily, and that might not be the case,
here's another source that says this,
and it goes against what you guys think,
and they go, no, no, no, you're just making you confusing everybody.
Stop, stop, stop.
It's dangerous.
It's like, why?
Yeah.
It's crazy.
That's the mentality they have.
Are we making progress in the war to bring out reality?
Yes.
It's not even, we all, I have some stuff planned in the next month or two
that's going to shake some things up.
Let's just say that.
I got some cards in my back pocket that I'm ready to,
some pocket aces, let's say,
in my back pocket ready to go.
Yeah.
Do you know what you are?
You've gotten your training and your lightsaber,
and now you're ready to use it.
Now you're ready to use it.
You see how those sources, you can shut somebody down entirely
with sources.
You don't have to have ideas.
Ideas are for BS that nobody wants to watch people bat around ideas.
Anyway, that's for those bottom feeding academics.
That's what his book's all about.
I'm going to take a cognitive approach.
A heuristic approach to the data,
and we're going to formulate a coherent hypothesis,
and then a cognitive style in the sense of the data.
Shut the fuck up.
Come on.
What I'm going to say, you're just a bunch of gibberish.
Dan, your guy was arrested in a public park with a naked kid, Dan,
screaming, I'm not a trafficker.
Yeah, something's wrong, Dan.
Something's wrong with your guy.
We need to find out.
We need to bring that forward.
People say, why can you not be inclusive?
Because, and I think Neil will back me up on this,
but Calimacus taught me, who's one of these museum guys.
He was associated with the museum.
Calimacus comes out, great poet, and he says,
that spring of Apollo, it must always remain untainted.
It must be completely pure.
And it's your job as a servant of the muse to guard that spring.
No funny business.
Nothing being put in there.
It's just that coming directly from that earth.
It's coming directly from that ground.
That's the evidence that we have in this language.
And it is that, it's its strength.
You know, somebody was asking me about Kabbalah, right?
And how Kabbalah distorts the ancient classical wisdom spring, right?
I had somebody just refute me recently.
I was watching it and I was like, look, what was his name?
I can't remember.
I think it was Gandalf.
Gandalf was refuting me.
He talked about this, you know,
Oh, I'm in talks about the sophistication of the Greek.
This can't be that this has got to be coming from a Hebrew word.
And he says, I'm going to refute him.
And then he goes into a palindrome.
Something about 443243578 adding up to the palindrome 3663.
And I was like, oh my God, where's the tin hat?
Where is, where is the science?
You just splattered.
You had like a machine gun, bro.
And you just splattered evidence out there.
There's no way somebody like a Dan or a Kip can survive in that type of environment.
So the academics run, they're going to start running from you.
And they're going to say, you are of the dark side.
You are the dark side.
That quote that you brought up tonight in Greek was about that dracon that is in the breast.
It is about that sign of the initiate who follows Saba Zeus and Saba Oth.
This is the Curio Saba Oth that we're talking about.
When you see that Sabbath, Lord of the Sabbath in your Bible,
you can't hear it because you're, it's coming through a filter.
But that's a Greek term in a Greek mystery.
Yep.
Yeah.
With iao, iao.
You know what I do when I iao?
You know what that literally is?
This is magic, right?
Because it's all over the magical papyri as well.
The pronouncement, the pronouncement of that concept,
the birth of that concept is healing.
iao, right?
It is literally, Greek is iao.
Oh my, that means I'm healing.
I am medicating.
I'm not in line with the toxin.
Yeah.
And it's also, it's also, when Peralta just talks about all the gods from the Phoenicians
and the Arabians and Sinai, when he's talking about that part of the world,
because he's doing a tour.
He's over, he talks about Egypt.
He talks about Phoenicia.
He talks about India.
He talks about Babylon, Syria, Phoenicians.
He never says Israel.
But then he goes down into the little Sinai region and he says,
there's only the gods though.
The major gods over there are Dionysus and Aphrodite.
So you got to put two and two together.
Who is this iao character that everyone's worshipping over there?
It's this Eastern Dionysian mystery cult.
And the evidence is so overwhelming.
But no, it's just not, for some reason, it gets ignored.
People would look at the Chaldean oracles and they just say,
ah, who knows what they meant by that?
Or who knows what Sebesius, who knows?
Let's just ignore it.
And just pretend it's not there.
I'm not doing that.
I'm surely bringing these sources to the forefront.
That's why we take those sources and ram them.
Ram them into the recta of all the people who have obscured
the beautiful light of classical wisdom.
Yeah, somebody was asking me, why can't you be inclusive?
Why can't you have to include these people?
You know why you cannot include Christianity in the classical stream?
Because it is a poison that will kill you.
That's why it's always that, it's that fresh stream.
You want to know what it's like doing?
It's like taking a perfectly five-course dinner
with a nice glass of beautiful, expensive wine.
And then adding McDonald's in there.
And then Kabul is the opposite.
Kabul is like having a McDonald's dinner
and taking a little bit of a beautiful wine
and adding it to whatever there is going on.
It's not, you know, mix these things.
They don't deserve to be mixed together.
They oppose each other.
They're opposites.
That's how New Ages, I like what you guys are doing.
You're bringing back all these mystery stuff.
But you can't mix these two.
These are opposites.
That's why they call them pagans.
They call them rustics.
Because they're the image of Pan, the rustic god.
It's the image of the devil.
Dionysus is the horned goat.
He has a bunch of sadders around him.
They're Prometheus.
They are demons.
I love that.
I love that.
I love that when you said, what is this guy doing
with all of the saders?
He's in the middle of this thing, what's going on?
Yeah, welcome to the power of the Bacchic Empire.
Welcome, and the origin of that, they called Medea
the origin of that power.
They actually called her the diwanasa.
Imagine during your lifetime being called a divinity.
You have to have done some remarkable stuff
for people to look you in the eyes and to worship you.
That's amazing.
As a life giver, as a soterra, as she brings salvation.
All of those terms, you said all of those terms were Christian.
Exactly.
With plus one more, the gospel.
What is the gospel?
It's a Greek word for the power of the medicine.
It's what the medicine does.
What does the medicine do?
It gives you new life.
By the way, Yvonne Galeon has that Iwa in the beginning.
Iwa, Galeon, good news, whatever you want to call it.
It has Iwa right in the back, right off the bat.
It's got that Bacchic shout.
So you're shouting the salvation.
That's what Iwongaleon means.
Hallelujah.
Allelutzo.
Now listen to what you just did.
Allelutzo, you just did it in its original,
in its original older form, way older, right?
And people say hallelujah and they want hallelujah.
They don't even know where that comes from.
You realize you're shouting a shout to praise Bacchus, right?
You realize you're doing it.
It really tickles the devil to watch,
to watch the followers of Jesus Christ praise Bacchus.
It's hilarious.
Okay, there it is. Allelutzo.
Okay, and look at LXX is on there.
Hallelutzo.
That's another form of it.
General cry, Bacchus, Bacchus.
It's a Bacchic shout.
And look, here's another one.
Allelutzo.
Look how many times it used theocrates.
Homer, Demetrius, Odyssey.
Hey, Sikius.
Oh, it's all over the place.
Yeah.
That word is used all over the ancient world.
So we're not making this up.
We're going to the sources.
This is real stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for coming on tonight.
Tell me just really quick before we go.
I want to know what the next documentary topic is going to be.
Patient drugs.
I'm doing that.
That's the one I want to have.
I have two.
So I'm very ADHD-brained
where I can start working on a project
and then all of a sudden a new idea pops in my brain
and I start working on that one.
I usually have two or three things going on at once.
So I have two projects that are like in the works.
They are going to be done.
I'm not finishing them before I leave.
I'm leaving on the 9th or the 8th, I think.
The night of the 8th.
Be there on the 9th to go to Florida.
Be back in a few days after that.
And then it'll be done probably within that week.
So it'll probably be done mid-May, the first one,
but it's going to be ancient drugs,
ancient medicine stuff.
And then I have another video about
tracking down monism and Pythagorean monism,
how we get Judeo-Christianity from that,
not the other way around.
That'll be another interesting video.
Cool.
Can you do me a favor?
And when you see Danny, tell him I said hello
and tell it to Steve as well.
Steve is Danny's Chewy.
And I just, I miss him.
It was the best day of my life, man.
You're going to have so much.
It's going to be such a great experience for you.
Yeah, please, please give him a nice, firm handshake.
Say, that's for Mom.
And he just wanted me to say, reach out.
Say hello.
That's a good dude right there, Danny.
I like Danny.
Yeah, yeah.
No, totally, totally.
You go, oh God, I envy you for being able to help.
He invites me back.
I'm going to stay for longer if he does.
Yeah.
Anyway, okay.
And the topic was drugs.
So you're going to be pulling in that direction
and getting some more information on that.
And there's a ton of sources that you can get into
for all that kind of stuff.
Fantastic.
And we are pulling back.
Can people see that we're pulling back that film
that kind of blurs you to the reality of the history?
That's coming out and people are becoming interested
in those only because people like Neil are using
those tools, those ancient texts, their weapons,
their weapons for civilization, for civilization.
Is there anything on the feed tonight, Chewy,
that you wanted any comments that you wanted to highlight
just to see?
I don't want to leave the congregation out of it.
And hail knowledge.
Yeah, that's nice.
Put me up a couple, Chewy.
Put me up a couple.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Great work.
Look at this.
Thank you, Neil.
Look, thank you, Neil.
Almond and Chewy.
Can't wait for the classes.
Yes, they're coming.
They're coming and give me another couple.
Hail, Hail, Satan's.
Those are cool.
Kelly.
Yeah.
Reed Galen.
Who put that up?
Oh my God.
Look, the nerd factor here is amazing.
Kelly, Reed Galen and Diascortes.
Look, somebody was like,
Hey, shut up and read Galen.
You know, that is great, bro.
That is great.
And I saw that the low classical series
that they have had a couple more Galens translated
since the last time I saw it.
So I think they got more of the De Mothodo-Medendi,
which is like a nice general work on ancient medicine,
right?
The general practicing.
Yeah.
Love it.
Okay.
And the theories.
Oh, yeah.
It's all sorts of lots of theories.
Looking forward to Almond.
Yes, anybody, Simone, anybody who is interested in AlmondU,
it'll be up and functioning.
I will drop the address for you to go to that.
And if you want to be involved and you want to enlist,
and I just want to repeat,
you can see here what Neil is doing,
and you can see what it takes.
It takes sweat and dedication.
So those of you who want to come to AlmondU,
you've got to have that drive.
You're right.
Everybody can do it.
I can make you do it.
But you've got to have that drive to commit.
You want to get to that place
that the Greek opens up your brain, right?
And you're sitting on your throne and you have that star.
You possess that star.
That's where I want people to be able to get to.
And the Greek will take you there.
People cry.
It's a very, it's amazing to watch what happens
when you give people access.
And suddenly they get something.
It's like a gem.
And they're like, it opens them up.
And the next thing you know,
they're doing something nerdy, artsy.
You know what I mean?
They're doing something that has to do with the muse.
I love it.
Okay.
I'm going to stop.
I'm going to stop.
And I'm going to give you the last word tonight.
Bravo, sir.
And Hail Satan.
Of course, Hail Satan all day long.
You know, bring back the museum.
We need to return to the mystery religions
and bring back the images again,
where all of a sudden images are evil for some reason.
Do not make any graven images of anything.
Why?
Think about why.
Why is that the number one listed in the 10 most serious
commandments out of all the 613 laws there are,
the most serious one is about making images.
Think about that.
Seriously, think about why that is.
Because there's a power in that.
There's a power in the image.
There's a power of the image of hermaphroditus.
That's evil compared in the eyes of the Christians.
That is an abomination.
Get it down.
Take it down.
All this fucking taking down statues
and destroying the temples.
And all of ancient Rome is in ruins now.
And there's churches everywhere.
No, we need to rebuild the museum.
We need to put up those dirty images back up
because they represent something real in nature.
And those are that.
That's just the way this is the reality.
Bring back reality.
That's what I'm saying.
Reason, Gnosis, logos, all that.
So, yeah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah and Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
I'm on the harp in the bongal drums, like the magic gin.
In the morning, I'm on the harp in the bongal drums.
I'm on the harp in the bongal drums, like the magic gin.
In the morning, I'm on the harp in the bongal drums.
I'm on the harp in the bongal drums, like the magic gin.
In the morning, I blaze weed, get behind the mule and push.
Someone's got to grow this sage and frankincense
so they can get high.
Cornucopia from the garden orchard.
Bobo rigatoni sipping wine at the bar collades.
Have a little taste.
High off the contact.
Sounds nice.
The perfume is the intoxication.
