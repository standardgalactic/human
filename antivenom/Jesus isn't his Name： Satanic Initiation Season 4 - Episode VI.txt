Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, Indians go crazy and the Scots men must not bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you gotcha
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon Satanic Initiation
It's good to have you, tonight we are full packed
We're going to have a lot of input from the outside
And ultimately we're going in deep, deep, deep, deep
More drugs, more drugs, warning, more drugs
We're going to be talking about more drugs for antiquity
Yeah, a little more right
And we get to bring back one of my favorites, Pendar
Pendar, tonight on Lady Babylon
Tonight I want to start off with a couple of new sections
I want to talk about input from you guys
So can we have a new, can we have the display of our first segment
Called viewer input
Dramatic, dramatic indeed, dramatic indeed
Let's pull up a couple of comments there
I want you people to see what you are saying
What do we have tonight?
Let me just read that one out
The word from Mark is for robber
Not, quote unquote, child trafficker, right?
Doesn't Josephus use the word for the rebels often?
Wouldn't that make much more contextual sense?
Cow, right at the start, right at the start
Get that down, Jeremiah, thank you
But you know that every time somebody brings up Josephus
That an angel cracks one right in your face
No, and you're not right
We're going to look at the word and we're going to look at that child trafficker
As part of our time together tonight
So perfectly relevant, thanks Jay
Well, who do we have next?
Amen, my brother, this was on top
This was top grade hallucinogenic
And then wow, a whole bunch of this stuff going on there
Fantastic, Dr. Bitterbrains
I can't agree with you more, Dr. Bitterbrains
If I can intoxicate you
If we can work on this together back and forth
Don't think that I'm not loving it
Don't think that it doesn't do me
You know what I mean?
This is the way that you get there
Love it
And finally we have one more, I think
This is from Misty
It's one month ago, but I think it deserves our note here
Not sure how I got here
Intrigued, may my awakening continue
And you know you're in the right place
You know you're in the right place when people are intrigued
Talk about awakening, as soon as somebody talks about awakening
I'm there, right, love that
Anytime those eyes can be open
Right, it's a good thing
Reason is a good, good thing
Fantastic
Tonight I also want to bring you a question
And in order to do that
We are going to have a new approach
A new approach, I know I'm throwing a lot of new things at you there
But I want you to have a variety
So I'm going to answer a question
This is a new segment we're doing
And we're going to employ both good cop and bad cop
Hit it Chewie
Yeah, questions of the day
Questions of the day
Very dramatic
Okay, so our question for today
Take it down Chewie
Question for today is
Did Jesus exist?
Yeah
Did Jesus exist?
Good cop, what do you think?
I think, Your Honor
That Jesus was only as real
As the naked boy with whom he was arrested
Yeah, bad cop, you want to say?
Yeah, I do want to say
Hey Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Yale
You failed, you failed miserably
You've got a group of people asking questions
Did he exist?
Did Julius Caesar exist?
Do I care about your questions, academia?
You have a whole, you have a whole debate right now
They give themselves names
Because this is what academics have time for
Clowning, mythicists, I'm a mythicist
You're nothing, you're nothing
Is that too much, a little too much bad cop?
Yeah, you know, is Jesus real?
Does it matter? Does it matter?
To that naked kid he was arrested with, it doesn't matter
Right? Yeah, yeah
We want to see who is there
And we are seeing through the text
And that's what I want you to have are the texts
So I want to ease us in to the place that we're going tonight
Did you see how I already had the ship on?
We're already out there, you know what I mean?
And let's slide ourselves in with a little bit
Just a little bit of the breaking of the fairy tale
Just hang in there with me
Memory is a funny thing, plays tricks sometimes
And it lies out bright of the times
It'll tell you that bad times were good and good times were bad
It'll tell you that black was white
You can close the door on the ones you don't like
Change them around and make the wrong right
But you can't ever trust them to tell the truth
And sometimes I like them to lie
And so I remember you
Just the way I want to
Not the way you really were
And all
So, we're in that world
Coming to, here we are, everybody out, the ship's landed
Right, here we are, where did I take you today, right?
We're going to bring up Pindar
And you're going to see something that nobody else has ever seen
Let me just say that, I can assert that
You people know me, you know how true I am to the science and the reason
If it doesn't fit, the reason, there's no reason to have it
Yeah, so that's our measure, this is the museum, right?
And tonight I'm going to bring you the name of Jesus
I'm going to bring you the name of Jesus, I am
And we are also going to do something maybe that you haven't ever seen before
We're going to take a look
At this Lady Babylon
Professionally, we're going to bring you her song
We're going to bring you her song, so what am I doing?
Oh, here it comes, can you feel it?
It comes Pindar, come here buddy, have a seat
I have a seat, what I need from you
Are some verses, I need some verses, some kind of song Pindar
I need some verses and I need to put those together
Like this Roman woman showed me, this Roman woman showed me how to do this
Put these verses together in order to complete the song that is hidden within
It's a religious thing, yeah
And if you're into codes, it's a beautiful way to fly
On your orphic wings, love it
So we've got another video here for you
And I want you to realize that these are Pindaric verse
This is my translation that follows in English
And we are looking to resurrect Lady Babylon
Let's take a look at her, chewy
Pindar
Pindar
Pindar
Pindar
Pindar
Pindar, that was the fourth Pythian Ode
The fourth Pythian Ode is a record
A record of the prophecy of Medea
Yeah
And we're going to look at a couple of lines of it, I know we've talked before and we've had Pindar here
Everybody loves Pindar, right?
There's no reason not to
And what I'd like to do is I'd like to show you, to take you in kind of focus
Why don't you bring up that Greek text? Just let people appreciate it
I'm going to be reading and translating to you
As we go along
Yes
I want you to notice that we are talking about the Medea
Whose words were fulfilled in the 17th generation
What is that daughter of the one who possesses the fleece, Aedes
Yes, the one who possesses the fleece
What does that fleece have?
I've never known the fleece or seen the fleece, it has a song written on it
And we're about to get acquainted with that song
Thank you, Zayn, by the way
Thank you, Zayn, for the great songs
And just a little tidbit for you, by the way
Kudos to Zayn for getting kicked out of being asked not to come back to an establishment in New York
That, you know, maybe didn't appreciate songs about crystal math, you know
But he's writing for us a song about Jesus and an naked boy
Jesus and an naked boy, love it, thank you Zayn
We're back, we're back to Pender
And I want to remind you all that from that mouth
From that divine mouth, that Stoma
Comes that song that ultimately is written
Is written on the skin of Ram
Yeah, yeah, it's got a golden fringe
It's got a golden fringe, we're going to look at it and what all of that means
We're going back to the initial, we're going back to the initial mystery
Right, we are squarely, where are we dimensionally?
Dimensionally we're in Libya, at Siwa, right
We're receiving that oracle
Where are we at in time?
Where are we at in time?
Yeah, we're right there when it was decided that it would be given to him
Yeah, it would be given to him, and how do we get there?
We have to get there with some kind of force and energy
And as everybody knows that is what, that is what runs the universe
That's how magic works, right?
There's a reason that we go to Cyprus
There's a reason, because if you don't go to Cyprus
If you don't go to Aphrodite
None of your, none of what you're doing will get off the ground
Yeah, gorgeous
So, Pindar takes us there through this oracle, right?
Of the Medwa, through her oracle
And what, who does she talk about?
She talks about, I'm going to translate a couple of lines to you here
So they ended up going to the Fossus River
This is in Caucus, right?
Some of the major places, right?
Medea's kingdom
Medea's kingdom, right?
Father's ruling, fantastic
And what happens when they go there?
Now, Potnia, the Aksotaton, Beleon, Foichilan,
Junga, Tetra, Namon, from Olympus
What's happening?
Erigenea, who has the sharpest arrows
You like that?
Sharpest arrows
Remember we're in bow cultures, right?
She has the sharpest arrows
And what does she do?
She offers up a, a what?
A dappled rhineck, it's a bird
It's called a yonks, it's called a yonks
And what is this thing?
You know the story of the yonks, the story of the yonks
Who is yonks?
Daughter of Echo Pan
Yeah, and what does she do?
She sings
And the witches, the witches would tie a yonks
To a four-cornered circle
Yeah, hoop
And then play the rhineck
Play the bird
Do you know what sound the rhineck makes?
We're told it sounds like a single fluted pipe
Not the double, but the single
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
And what do you make music like this for?
What do you, what do you think Aphrodite?
Do you think there's some Aphrodisiacs involved in this process?
Well, I told you there were more drugs coming, right?
What do you, what do you do with this?
What do you do with this?
You make that sound, that instrument
Isn't that neat?
They played, by the way,
if you didn't notice the Greeks played animals
As musical instruments
Nice
That's, that's harnessing your environment
You know what I mean?
That's doing your thing
I love it
And what does she do?
Cyprus
Kipraganea
Aphrodite
You know, she takes this bird
And she ties that bird
She ties that bird to that four-cornered hoop
Creates her music
And that hoop is inescapable
Pindar, what?
That hoop is inescapable
Yeah
Yeah
What does she bring?
She brings Manade Ornen
She brings the Minatic Bird
The Minatic Bird
Remember how we looked at Bacchus?
And Bacchus always leads, he always leads to Aphrodite
Here she is
Here she is
And what is Junkz going to do with that song?
What is Junkz going to do with that song?
She's going to draw that erotic power
She's going to draw that erotic power
Yeah
Okay
If you're not comfortable, kiddies, with the witches
I have to say that's too bad
That's too bad because we want the witches here
We want the witches here
Respond, say something in the comments
Please, tell us if you want the witches here or not
But if we've got the witches here, we're going to have to be involved in Aphrodisiacs, are you ready?
If you think I'm kidding, I'm just reading to you from the text
It's not credible trickery here
What does she do? She taught
She first taught men, who did? Aphrodite
She first taught men, what does she teach them? Litas, prayers
And what? Ipaoidas
What is an epode?
That's a magic song
Ipaoidas, I'm sorry for you
And you know what I'm talking about?
Those who haven't come to the orgia
Right?
Every frustrated, unsatisfied evangelical married woman out there
I'm talking to you
Yeah, these are her rights
This is what you have to pay
In order to get your salvation
It's what you have to pay
You have to sacrifice it
You have to sacrifice it
Mary tried to get the antidote to him
She tried to get to the antidote to him
Right? Didn't take it, ended up dead
Right?
There's a reason that this involves sexuality and drugs
People are saying, look, sex and drugs, sex and drugs
What's a sex and drugs?
Sex and drugs is religion
Yeah, I know that sounds funny
But sex and drugs is religion
The operation of the mystery involves sex and drugs
And Jesus getting arrested with a naked boy
Is not unusual
Yeah, let's go back
You don't believe me about the drugs
I know you don't, but here, what does she teach them?
Yeah, she taught them those prayers
And those epodes, those magic songs
Those are songs that when sung can change physics
It's the only way to describe it
Songs that when sung can change physics
Been time and space
It's gorgeous, love it, right?
Drawing down the stars
Did you think they had to have an epode
In order to draw down the stars?
Right? Of course she did
You guys are one step ahead of me anyway
Very intelligent group
Very intelligent
I can tell from your comments
And why, who else did she teach?
She taught the Sophan Ishanidon
Yeah, Ishanides, the son of Isen
Yeah, who is that?
That is Yasun
Yasun
Yeah, yeah
Give me the yonks
Pull out the yonks before we get the drugs
Pull out the yonks
Yeah, look at this people
This is gorgeous
Here's your Reineck, right?
Here's your Reineck
Look at number two
Metaphor, spell or charm
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
But look at what it says at the end of that one
Passionate yearning
What does number three say?
Oh here, we get to make fun of people who study
Aramaic and biblical studies
For a minute, this is fantastic
I love this, where'd you come from?
I told you to stay in your cage
Metaphor, spell, charm
Passionate yearning for
Oh yes, hitaron
Agathon hitaron, you want those good hitaron
Those good companions
Those women can teach you
Surprised?
Yes, they weren't
Yeah, they weren't
Fantastic
Oh, I love this
Did you notice that that's the thing
Between the pagans and the Christians
And the Orthodox Jews
And the Muslims like Artalaban
Artalaban in Afghanistan
The people who tend to cover up women
Splash acid on them
Take away their rights
Those kind of people
Rape them when they're twelve
But okay, pay your fine
And you can marry the kid
That type
This is a goddess that doesn't abide
That type
Yeah, you can't get to that type
Artalaban, you can cure Artalaban
Did you know that?
You can cure an Orthodox Jew
You can cure an evangelical Christian
All of them want the apocalypse
All of them
But you can cure them
You can cure them
Take them
You
You
Just a little bit of rockiness there
Yeah, we got it
Should we take care of it
Right through an asteroid belt
You know what I mean?
Sometimes it happens
For those of you who are commenting
On my internet
Ha ha, funny funny
Yes, yes in fact
It's the price I pay for being up against the mountain
Yes, but I'll take the mountain mother any day
If we have interruptions
We can always come back
Nothing I say is that important
I assume everybody heard the cure
So we'll go on from there
Fantastic
Here we go
Tell me about drugs
Yeah, why did she teach that wise Jason
Yasun
Oh
We'll get back
We got some magi running around
I'm sorry, there's some magicians
Okay, chill chill
Here we go
Why did she give these things to Yasun
He might
Fool
Take away the
Shame
That Medea
Had in the company of her parents
Oh wow
That sounds
That sounds like something, this prince
By the way, he's really handsome right
He's been trained
By those centaurs
Right, you're in trouble
You're in trouble
If the guy that you're dating
Has been trained by centaurs
You gotta watch your drink all the time
Right, watch your drink
But they needed her
She's the only one that could make this work
So they needed Medea
To do it
And that's why Cyprus is there
And
I promise you drugs
I keep promising you drugs
Come on kids, let's go into the park
Right
I just
I just realized
Somebody asked about
The
Pirate
The child trafficker
Right
That Leistace
Is the title of Aphrodite
It's a place of
Aphrodite
The child abductor of Aphrodite
The pirate of Aphrodite
You wanna read the pirate of Aphrodite
The child trafficker
And what he does
Does that mean child trafficker
It means exactly what it means
In the ancient text
And the ancient text tell us
That it's all
It's all about
That taking of the
Youth
For the sale
Yeah
Dedication
It's a dedication
There wouldn't be so many of you
Killing each other
Say the watchers
You wouldn't be
If you had this mystery
In operation
The mystery of Anemia
Isn't that nice
In the mystery of Anemia
You can take
A person
Who might go out
And do violent things
To other people
Yeah
You can give that person
Into the hands
Of the great queen
Yeah
And that person will come back
Having looked into the eyes
Of the mother
You know, will come back
With an enlightenment
And eyes open
Eyes open
Yeah
And then your democracy
Alright
So now's the question
Will you honor
Decay justice?
Let's go back to the text
We're going to beat up some Aramaic scholars, weren't we?
Yeah, they don't have Jack, right?
Everybody out next person
Says the word Aramaic to me
It's just north of
It's just north of a fart
Of Josephus through an angels rectum
It's just north of that
Yeah
So, yeah, there's nothing
Man, they're administrative stuff
Inscriptions
Of a single letter
It's awful. Don't tell me
That has anything to do with it
It doesn't
It's fantastic. Where is Moses' potion?
We're going to take it. Hang on
Put that down
Put that down for a minute
Okay, now we're going to
Go real quick
We're going to jump Bronze Age
And we're going to go to where
Moses is sitting at the bush
Moses is sitting there at the bush
What are you doing, Moses?
He is
Looking at a bush that doesn't burn
It's on fire
But it doesn't burn
It's on fire. This burning bush
But it doesn't burn
Yeah, what is this thing?
What does our oldest text
Say it is?
The text, the Septuagint
Which is the native original
The Septuagint
Is not a translation
The Septuagint says
It is the Kasia
Yeah
And what does the Kasia do?
Get this
Ladies, I love this
Remember, this is Moses
The guy who's holding up the serpent
Right
All that setting up tents
Where you can get the
Oracular word of God
Through your priests
Yeah, got the burnt altars going
That guy
Right
What is he doing
In front of this bush
What does it have to do with the serpents
And all that kind of stuff
Well, if you just look
Where the classicist Harvard
Never look
You might find in these
Sources like
Diascorides
The name Moses
Directly attached with the medicinal use
Of the bush
That burns but is not consumed
Now you know
Look, I just stormed into your temple
And took your junk
I just stormed into your temple
And I took your junk
You know who I'm talking to
Yeah, what does Jehovah
Have to do with it
Cool to you all, right
That thing's made up
From later
This name is Joshua
Wait, what?
I thought you said it was
Joshua
Joshua
No, it's not
It's Jesus
Yeah
This is a perfectly good Greek word
That predates
Any sort
Of Hebrew that you have
By 600 years at very least
If not longer
As soon as you guys in linear A
Get your act together
Figure it out
Okay
We'll have more data then
You know, that laundry list
It's not laundry list, bro
There's a lot there
Show us the drug, Zaman
What is he gonna do this for?
What is Jason gonna do this?
On Aphrodite's direction
What is he gonna do?
He's gonna
Make the mind
Of her mad
Burning
He's gonna make her mind burn
At the edge
Of the whip
Whose whip is it?
Desire
Desire
Petho
Desire
You feel that?
That's something new that evangelicals
Won't feel
I'm sorry
Desire
You feel that desire? Cause you guys
Think that's bad
Anything that has to do with Aphrodite
Is bad
It took them Christians a long time
Right all the way up to the Pope
Gregory finally pardoned
Which Gregory
The great
Who finally pardoned Mary Magdalene
For having sex drugs on her
Using sex drugs with Jesus
You mean Jesus was using sex drugs?
Yeah, he was
Another question
Don't ask if Jesus exists
Ask if Jesus used sex drugs
Go find it
It's in there in the text baby
Love it
Remember
Pirate time
And here we go
Let's get back with Aphrodite
She's gonna make Madea's mind
At the lash
Taking the lash of desire
Yeah
She's gonna show her
She's gonna show him
The way
She's gonna show Jason the way
Isn't that nice?
Love it
They call her a Sotela
They call her and she's about to Christ
To Christ
Jason
Yason
Christos
Or
As one dude
From Judea who a bunch of
Stoned
Wisemen said this dude
By the stars
Son of God
Yeah
Yeah
So he comes back
Jesus Christos
Do you know what the difference is
Linguistically
Between Jason and Jesus
They're both titles
And you know what the distance is
Between them
One vowel
And we know
When it comes to using roots
In classical philology
The vowels do not
Matter
They are what
Focuses the root
Constantinal root
You can tune
You can tune with the vowels
The difference between Jason and Jesus
Is the dialectical difference
It's the drift of the Greek over time
It's exactly what he should be called
Right
You didn't realize that he also
Is a goddess
Some of you are into
The more esoteric
Content of antiquity
So you probably already knew that
Right
You're looking at that healer
You're looking at that healer
Who else has the title of Jesus
You know who has the title of Jesus
Here it comes
Here it comes
Are you ready?
Who do you call
Of the great gods
Of the Jesus
I'm not kidding
I'm not kidding
Who do you call the Jesus
The sotab
Who do you call that savior
Uh-huh
Guess what? Guess who bears
That badge
Of that healer
Of that healer
Who has that power
Through
The communion
Who has that? Who is that?
It's Athena
Are you surprised?
The virgin
Yeah
She
Is the Jesus
What is Jesus doing?
He's just operating within a cult
Of history
It's nothing
Exotic
It's happening all over the place
Right?
Did you notice the Romans weren't surprised?
Did you notice the Romans weren't surprised?
They were like, oh my god
We have religious fanatics on our hands
No
Because Herod's sitting there with Salome
Which thanks to
A couple of my students
We know is now
A drug formula
Okay, so wait a minute
Too many drugs
I'm about to come to the text
What is she doing?
Careful there, Chewie
What is she doing?
She's a pharma co-saissa
Pharma co-saissa
This is what
The queen is doing
This is what she's doing
The muse that writes
This is what she is doing
Aphrodite
You say
Do you really need the sacks in your religion?
Yeah, you do
The mystery doesn't work
Here we go
Aphrodite is there
Forming the drugs
Adding them to the oil
Drugs that are
Antitoma
Antitoma
It's one of the earliest
Words
For antidote
I've got several words
For antidotes and drugs
Antitoma
It's the anti-cutting
Or it's the cutting
That's in the opposite direction
Isn't that nice?
Now this happens to be
Hesechius
He defines it for us
What are you doing here?
You kind of smell a little bit
But all those hours
Sitting right in your lexica
You got all sweaty britches
Sweaty
Pharmacon antipathis
What is
What is an antitomon?
That
Aphrodite is giving to Jason
To use on the deal
What are these things?
They're pharmacon antipathis
They're drugs that are
Meant to balance
Meant to balance
The pain or the suffering
Isn't that nice?
They're the antipathis
Bring that up and whoever
Whoever drinks these
Whoever uses these
Is injured by no one
It's an Alexa pharmacon
He says, good
It's an Alexa pharmacon
What's an Alexa pharmacon?
Alexa pharmacon
Are drugs that are used
As antidotes
They are healers
Alexicacos
They push away or avert
Evil
They avert evil
So if you get bitten
You need an Alexa pharmacon
To be able to get through
The symptoms
That you're about to suffer
A balancing
The priests are the ones
That are having all of this knowledge
And using it
Between priests
Or priestesses
And physicians
The divine physician
The ather
Love it
Love it, love it
I'm going to read you a little bit more from Pindar
We're going a little bit long
What is she doing?
She's preparing her drugs
She's making the antidote
It's something that's going to work
Against his pain
Okay
He's going to be coming up
Against fire
So something
To repel that fire
And she gave it to him
For what?
For his
Christing
For his
Christing
This is not anointing
For his Christing
You can rub oil
For anybody that you want
But that is not Christing
When you get Christed
You get stung
You get stung into the madness
Why does she have to do that?
Because she's using it on the medwa
To get her to help
The iasan
Yes, isn't that nice?
The gods
Always
Making things work
Love it, love it
What happens?
Oh, this is beautiful
You love this
She Christs him
Right?
And what happens
When people get Christed?
He says
Right in the next, very next line
Very next words
Katainesan
Tekoinon
Gamon?
I heard something
Gametic is going on
Right? Gametic
Somebody is falling
Doing something
Woo!
Koinon
Mutual
They're going into that glukon
That sweet place
Mixing ale
Aloisi
With
Each other
In intercourse
And what do they do it on?
They do it on the fleece
Because the fleece has a golden edge
The fleece has a golden edge
What is that fleece called?
The original name for that fleece
That Pindar gives us
Isn't just the product of
Fleecing
It's not just textiles
Textiles
Right?
He calls it the bedding
The bedding
Of the fleece
That lamb
I'm that lamb
Everybody says I'm that lamb
And I have the flocks in my eyes
And it doesn't like you, what? A lamb?
Guess what? That skin
Is the same word in Greek
That Jesus is using for that lamb
That Saint John is writing
For that lamb with the flocks
In his eyes
Bring it up
Stromne
Bedspread
For better couch mattress
Bedding
And it's used of the golden fleece
Yeah
And what happens on that golden fleece?
We know that what's written on it
Is her song
That song is in an ink
That contains something called
The burning flame
The burning flame
That contains something called
The burning purple
And we know that there is a communion
That is shared
Between the two
On the fleece
On the fleece
And how does he come out of it?
Well, because of what
Aphrodite gave him
He doesn't get burned up
He gets his courage
And he gets his capacity
To go out
To fulfill what she needs
To be done
Right?
Yeah
It was a request from Eira
Nice
Nice
Love it
I want to read one last line to you
I had some more Greek that I'd like to show you
Some definitions maybe we'll run through
But
I just want to kind of
Get to the end tonight
Yeah
The fire did not
Touch him
The fire did not affect him
Says Pindar
Why?
Because of the genius
Of
Medea
The genius of
Medea
Because of the genius
Of
Medea
She
Who knows
All drugs
In antiquity, they'd call you
Fatima case, that's just a witch
Right?
You know drugs okay
You know them better than your average Joe
And you're involved in meetings
Yeah
Meetings where you worship Aphrodite
We know you guys
We know you guys get
There's sacrifices
We know that you're involved
With
Making eunuchs
We know that you're involved in
Sexual performance
That is
Drug inspired
We know that
No problem with that
But
What we're interested in looking at is
Where did you guys get all this stuff
Where is this mystery operation
Coming from
River Fossus
For those of you who knows
The Edim reference
That is the place, the paradise
Where the
Where she who shouts
Bacchus, that's where she is
Right?
Was our serpent
Didn't belong to them
Appropriation is appropriation
But
Goes back deep
All the way through the Pulaskians
We love it
That epode
And
Thanks to the Palm Pharmacon
What is that?
That's the highest, that's the highest
Linguistically the highest level
That we have recorded
For the witch who knows the drugs
That's your
Fatima case
Or your Fatima case
And you have
You have your
Polypharmacon
The state of
Knowing many drugs
Which is a step above that
Regular witch, you better watch out for her
She's doing stuff like castrating people
And
You know
For what lack of a better word
Experimentation
A lot of psychedelic stuff
We don't have her anymore, right?
We don't have that Polypharmacon anymore
We don't have, but there's one step above that
And that's the
Palm Pharmacon
That's that root pan
That's everything
She is the
Witch
That is the witchiest
Yeah, because that word for witch
Doesn't come from that terrible Anglo-Saxon
Whatever that is
Sounds like the guy had a
Stroke or something, right?
Um, no, it's the
Fatima root
The root, it's the drugs
It's the drugs
Fantastic
And here's the skill in all charms
Notice that the only reference we're going to have
Is to Medea, right?
And despite this
Despite the fact that she had
The
Reputation of being the most advanced
In ancient drug use
And ritual
And despite this
She
Still
Shined as a genius
Right? Even though
Even though we see it in a context
That's very foreign to us
You can feel the radiation
From Medea's
Discoveries is what I'm trying to say
This woman
Was a genius
Hands down
And incredibly skilled
This is Lady Babylon
Right? This is Lady Babylon
Which she was the queen of
Right?
And the founder of the Medes
And all you purses
All you people call yourselves Persians
Right? It was a royal line
That came through Caucus on the Black Sea
You realize that, right?
Right?
So, yeah
Get your bearings there, Magi
Get them in. Where was that word
That meant Chaldean? Remember one of our
Words was with the Chaldeans, right?
We can't lose track of these people
These are all nations
And tongues
Right? Assembled together
So that the abomination
Of the Animosis
Can be seen in the temple
Again, right?
Good. Love it
And
I think we will
I've got just a couple of words for you
Let me just pull out a couple of words
Where are some of the words too that I didn't get to
We were at Yonks
Yeah, here's your Pirates
You want your
Your true pirate
Right?
You want your true pirate? Look at the very last thing
That it says here at the bottom
Leisteis
It's a later word
When you say Jesus wasn't a pirate
You weren't thinking
Oh, this is a later word
For a child trafficker
Right? Associated particularly
With Cyprus
Do you remember those
Pirates along the coast there?
Salishio
It was the
Pirates
We're in Disneyland
Mickey don't send you people here to beat me up
But we're in metaphorical
Disneyland
Isn't that amazing? A metaphor of a fantasy
Yeah, a metaphor of a fantasy
And here we are
We're on the ride
But our ride is going to take us somewhere deeper
It's going to take us back
To real people doing real things
In a reality that you didn't understand
Because you were living
In an evangelical
Husk
That was very unsatisfying
Again, wives
Hear my voice
You know who I'm talking about
Yeah, yeah
Fantastic
Somebody quick stand up
And be the
Pump Pharmacist
Hit that one
I just wanted you to see that
Who is that sourced after?
Never mind, let's go down
Hear the centaurs by the way
People, you know what they call them
In that
Thessalion
That is bleeding
The
Old, old, old
Pre-Greek
Pulaskian roots
Right songs
Fair
Ezekius tells us that
This is fair
And what is the fair?
You know that, it's the beast baby
That's where we get the theriacs
What is the centaurs?
What do the centaurs do?
Piederas dea
Piederas dea
Yeah, you heard me
You heard me
Pederasty
What do you think Yasun was doing?
Wait, Jesus?
Yes
What do you think he was doing?
Pederasty
Why do you think he was arrested with a naked boy?
Pederasty
He is a fan
Yeah
Long tradition within
They call it the mysteries
Right?
Mysteries
You get there
With Yasun
You get there with
Jesus Christos
You do
And that's why
We have to always
Answer the question of
Is Jesus real?
With
Stick it?
With
He's only as real
Academics
As the naked boy with whom he was arrested
Thank you
For coming tonight
I will see you next Wednesday
For a Bible study
And
In the meantime
Enjoy your input
Always want to hear it
Try to incorporate a bounce back and forth
Between
What the comments were getting live
And what we're doing
So Chewie's going to be doing that more
Picking out your comments then
Your genius
Flash up there
And pay for it
Right?
So
But I want you to be a part
Amen
Let's try it out
Can people tell me amen
Everybody give me amen
Does everybody hear me?
Congressional Satan
Amen
Hell Satan
That's the audience
Fantastic
Fantastic
Love it
Why is it so important
So that you can see with open eyes
So that you can see from that throne
Hell Satan
I will see you all
Wednesday
