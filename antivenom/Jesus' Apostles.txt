Mystery Judas
The little bitch that you give to the goddess, Athena follows a devious smile
She makes men fulfill their desires to be worth the woman
Crystal of Aphrodisiac, once you are out producing the theory egg
Watch out, your brain will open up, Athena with a purple cuff
Cheat you all up, control the crush
If you begin to place the ball on the move, magic is best sin
Wish you would
Cheat you all up, control the crush
If you begin to place the ball on the move, magic is best sin
Wish you would
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is Better Than Muse
And I'm gonna bring you a short story tonight
Now, I've got something fantastic for you
It's absolutely fantastic
This is a mystery
You're going to put on your investigators cap
And you're gonna solve a mystery tonight
The way that we're gonna do that is through the language itself
Through the Greek itself
And you're gonna learn something about Judas
It will allow you to have one of those aha movements
Now it makes sense, right?
And it'll give you a historical look at the text, right?
And that's all through the language, baby
We love that language, we love you, Mommy Greek
We love you
Do you know what, before I want to start
I want to bring you a couple of comments
Because Satanic congregation, I'll give you this
And by the way
By the way, by the way
Teddy base
Everybody go
Check out Teddy base
It's very cultic
It's very cultic
You know, it's just part of it
It's just part of it
Come, we get the songs
Oh, God
Yeah, it's gorgeous
Now, here's the reality
Here's the reality underneath
Are you ready for this?
Let's get a couple of comments
I'm gonna give you a couple of vitties
What are people saying about Satanic congregation?
Those of you who've been coming here for so long
And so faithfully
And I know there are those among you
Who are here just to cause problems
I know that too
But that's a minority
That's a tiny, tiny minority
I'm talking to the real members
Of the Satanic congregation
That's who I am
If you like enjoying your food
With Lady Babylon
Yeah, that's you I'm talking to
And you're not afraid of any whips
Are you?
No
Are you ready for this?
Give me a couple quotes
And then clips
Give me quote number one
No, we're gonna save that one
We're gonna save that one
Give me that one
Good
Who is this from?
Yeah, okay
Some guy with a general name
His kitchen is in a tiny apartment
An efficiency flat as the UKers call him
So he's definitely not a financial
Or marketing genius
That's for sure
Do you know what that is?
It is a reflection of the death
Of classical wisdom
It's a reflection
Do you hear how the atheistic world
And when I say that
I mean the monists
Because the monists create atheism
The monists create atheism
This gent is sucked into the
Monist atheistic universe
So what is their morality?
What do you think their morality is
In that universe?
The man's kitchen
The man's kitchen is not a
That's not a man of wealth
Listen to antiquity
Mr. Huha
Listen to antiquity
Who is the wisest?
Oh, Oracle
Who is the wisest?
Socrates is the wisest
Socrates
You know why?
Because he knew he didn't know
And he knew other people who said they knew
Were full of it
And he could just tear you apart
In a conversation
And for that the Oracle
Declared him to be the wisest of all
The wisest of all those people
Do you see classical morality?
Your greed stains your soul
With a stench of ruin
Do you know where that gentleman is?
That gentleman is in hell
Being punished for his greed
Give me the next one
Socrates had one cloak, baby
Do you know why Socrates had one cloak?
Because he didn't care
What you thought about him
He listened to his daemon
Give me the next one
These are funny
This dude is the biggest
Psyop ever
I'm a Psyop now
And I think he's been drinking a lot of drugs
From the seriously
Seriously
Psyop
Psyop
This dude is the biggest Psyop ever
Bruh
If you think that this
Has the capacity to carry on
Any sort of sophisticated operation
That involves, I don't know
Things like planning
No, no bras
You're in the wrong place
Give me the next one
Finally, let's hear some sense
From Leo
Is that Leo?
We'll just say Leo
If you listen to the fourth three
Now, what is this?
This is a note that was left
This is a note that was left
This is a message that's left
On an interview
No, it was a review
Somebody did a review of Lady Babylon
And this was one of the comments
That they left
If you listen to the fourth three
In a bit hour podcast
It gives one a drastically
Different portrait of the man
Well, that's odd
You think you didn't see
You only saw through their clips, didn't you?
Right, and it gave you a kind of
Distorted view
That's okay, thank you for saying it
I don't know if what he says
Is true or not
Right, he knows a whole
He knows a whole lot more about it
Than most people
Okay, thank you, that's nice
But you don't have to say it
It could all be absolute nonsense
But those were three of the most
Far out and fascinating hours
I've gotten from a podcast in years
I want to show you a couple of clips now
And I want you to sit with me
And the watchers
And I want you to see the atheistic
Monist soup in which you live
Are you ready?
It's topsy-turvy
Let's go for it, Chewie
Give me the first one
What I think that I got very confused by
Is that I'm confused as the wrong word
I am skeptical of
Lady Babylon's ability to translate anything
Interesting, okay
He doesn't have his PhD
But okay
That doesn't mean anything
I agree
He claims that he can read another language
That does not make you a good translator
I'm pretty sure that he's just making shit up
It's like those little games where you know
Like you're like, okay, make this letter
Be this letter
I think he's just saying
Okay, this word means this now
Okay, so that's what she thinks
That's what she thinks
You know, what's funny
Is when you see people who come
With a preformed conclusion already
They just have something there
They have some kind of
Now, just ask yourself
Is this person who's talking
Any sort of samurai?
Is there a reason?
They're putting down this other samurai
Maybe they're, I don't know
Maybe they're in linguistics
Maybe they're in classics
Do you know people have been asking
And vetting almond
And do you know what they're finding?
They're finding Hail Satan
That's what they're finding
They're finding that I'm just a classicist
And I'm just doing what classicists do
Yeah, yeah, it's no, there's no trick
There's no, no, it's just translation
Of those texts
Now, this person doesn't even know
Doesn't even know the discipline
And yet is willing to come out
With a general statement and say
Okay, let's hear some more
Let's hear some more
Did you see, by the way, how quickly
The gentleman turned around
When he said he does have a PhD
And she was like, that doesn't mean anything
You're right
You're right, Ms. Tightbox
And that's her name in all fairness
You're right, you're right
What I did was 12 years of university
That brought me three degrees in Greek
Ancient Greek classical philology
That's what I did
And ever since then, I've been reading it
That's who I am, that's where I am
So let's hit the next clip
Let's see what, watch the world, people
What they do, go
I have to say this right now
Especially for the people who are listening
To the podcast, you're right, he's an idiot
No genius would ever catch it like that
That is so dated
That looks like King Cobra Jaffa
That's his catch
That's not a nice play
And he has this shrine
That includes his riding crop
Which he, as you just heard, is about to grab
And again, for the people who are only listening
He's about to use it to thwack the floor
A whole bunch
He's a mental patient
Lucy, I heard he's single
This man is crazy, mommy
Pass me the chicken nuggets, Tom
No sauce
I'm getting married again
And he's the first guy I'm killing
Alright, alright
So you see
You see where the level of penetration is
Right, you see where the level of engagement is
Where people can engage
You're dealing with people who can only engage
On the surface to start with
Right, and they're not here because they want to be
They're here because they're trying to work
Their way up the ladder
Right, and they're going to critique this person
Without considering anything, background, any sort
But that's okay, we don't need them
You know why?
Because people can do those kind of things
And they have done them
They love to do them in the dark ages
Miss Titebox
Miss Titebox, do you know what you did wrong?
Miss Titebox
You messed with somebody who's well-trained
You messed with somebody who knows the art
And just to put your brain at ease
There's really not a difference between reading and translating
Because you're doing the same thing
Okay, I don't sit around and talk to the UN
Right, I don't do that
I don't change things from one language to another
I jump into the pit of the Greek
And I swim as deep as I can
That's what I do
That's my thing
Does it matter that my kitchen
Does my kitchen not impress you?
Seriously?
Does my kitchen not impress you?
Yes, yes
Do you see what happens to a society
That is no longer guided by polytheism
When you step away from justice
When you step away from those values
That make you a woman
When you step away from that hunter
What happens to you?
You become concerned about kitchens
Do you know?
I'm going to say something to half of you
Half of you out there
You are a mere reflection
Just a shade of the great women who came before you
Just a shade
Oh, if I had the power to give you
To become that vampire
Oh, God
Oh, God
Let's take a trip tonight again
Let's take a trip and look at the text
I'm going to flash up the one text up here
I'm going to give you one text
And it's going to guide everything tonight
Are you ready?
This is the mystery
What is going on here?
We're talking about the death of Judas
Bring him up, Chewie
We're talking about the death of Judas
Or what has been believed to be
The death of Judas
This is the crime scene
And who is our witness?
Our witness is Peter
And he is saying
After Jesus in his vampire form
Was taken back up into the Uranus
Which is where they all go, right?
After he was taken up
Peter and his gang
His gang of teenage cultists
Had to perpetuate the right
So they needed
Because Judas had been betrayed
And so what happens is
This is a little bit later
Right?
And what are we doing?
We're forming another mystery 12
Just like Paul does
Just like Jesus does
Just like anybody does
Who's following Ionic life
Whether it's your synagogues
That have Ion with the zodiac around them
Or whether it's your Christians
Talking about Ionic life
You need those 12
You need those 12
So what they do
They appointed another kid
To be involved
Yeah, another young person
To be involved
And what happened to Judas
In all of this?
Well there are two accounts
Here's part of the mystery
Are you ready?
I'm prepping you
We're going into this crime scene
And I want you to figure out
What happened
Okay, in this one verse
That's all
We're just looking at one verse
I want you to figure out
What actually happened
We have two accounts
One in Matthew
And one in the Acts of the Apostles
The first one in Matthew
Is totally different
It's totally different
From the other one
And the other one
The one in Acts
You will never see this thing
Depicted in art anywhere
As a matter of fact, Chewie
Is reaching into that quantum singularity
And pulling out the very first images
The very first images
Of what is actually going on
In this verse
Go ahead and throw that verse up there
Let's throw it up there
Boom
Here it is
Acts 118
What did Judas do?
He bought a piece of land
Isn't that nice?
He's an entrepreneur
He bought himself a piece of land
From what?
From the wage of his injustice
Right?
For turning in Jesus
He got that
Now we're going to get a phrase
That our whole goal here tonight
Is to try to translate
What happened?
What happened to Judas?
And he mentioned
Sai Gymnastics
And he invented
The rose of the flower
Alright?
Now I know
You're running to the end there
And you saw the rose of the flower
And you said
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
This is associated
with the boys
and theocratists
This is why
They chase boys
They talk about it
These are the goodies
The goodies the boys give
of, how do you think we tell all of this
Herospecy, all of this reading of the signs,
we do it from this power. Now
what does the English, and everybody asks this question, they've been
asking us, no it's not embryo, it's an exaggeration, people ask me this
question, why you, why are you giving us the
reality, and why haven't people before you
right, why haven't they come up and done it, and my
answer is because of the weakness of classical philology,
that classical philologists haven't been studying medical or scientific documents
for ages, and all they needed to do was look into the
pharmaceutical side, and they didn't, and I did
and I'm happy to have done that, and I'm bringing that to you.
Now what is, look at these translations of this verse, before I
translate it for you, which we're going to do,
I want you to see what the English is, are you ready, get your fantasy
caps on, with the payment he received for his wickedness,
Judas bought a field, there he fell
headlong, his body burst open, and all his
intestines spilled out, wait a minute,
what, first of all
is that Greek, does not say anything about falling,
there is no falling there, yeah, it doesn't,
I'm going to show you, it doesn't say, what do you mean his,
he burst open, he burst open, does anybody
know about this, right, this is what you call
immediate tummy explosion,
yeah, it happens all the time, if you're reading
the inerrant word of God, and you come across
this translation, please, please explain to me
what this means, Judas bought a field with the money he
received for his treachery, falling headfirst
there, his body split open, spilling out
his intestines, wait a minute, now this man acquired a field, yeah, yeah, yeah,
and falling headlong, he burst open, there's going to be a lot of falling headlong,
I don't know why translations, different translations are so similar,
it's because Christian translators are weak
because they don't read anything, but they're
garbage, and by garbage, everybody's got
garbage, right, everybody's got it, they're not
reading anybody else's, how are you going to strengthen
your understanding of the language, if all you read is the newspaper
from 1980, seriously,
what are you going to do, oh my god,
give me the King James, let's see what the King James does, now this man purchased the field
with the reward of iniquity, that sounds more ominous,
and falling headlong, he burst the sander in the midst
he
burst his belly in his midsection, he burst that open
right, okay,
okay, now how are we going to figure out what is actually going
on, right, are you ready, I'm going to reveal it for all the
Catholics and all the evangelicals,
all the Charismatics, right, you're going to get to see what this is actually
doing, and how do we do that, we do it from the
Greek, that's all, we do it from the Greek, give me the
first one, look at this people, having said that, here's some Latin
look at this, you know what this says
it's part of a quote, it's only part, but it's part
of a quote that says magic, right, comes from
medicine, right, why would they say magic came from medicine
this is plenty, why would they say this in antiquity, because of the
drugs, right, drugs are a part of medicine
but they are also the driver of magic,
yeah, so to them it's, you know, he says
nobody will doubt, right, like everybody knows
give me the next one, just a couple
of more, I wanted to give you, look at the first word here
now you were talking about Judas
I know, and now I'm talking about buprestis
what is that, it's a beetle
it's a beetle, a beetle
that in antiquity they said it's a little bit different
from, but it's in the same group, does the same thing
as cantarides, cantarides
what is cantarides, that's one of the blister
that produces little resin
and you know what it does, that resin is a love gift
it's a love gift, it's given to protect the eggs
the female will receive it and protect the eggs with it
but it's quite toxic, and why am I mentioning
buprestis, go back to the beginning, go back to that quote with buprestis
please, so he says the Greeks
talk about it in a couple of different ways
they say first of all it's good just for consumption of your
diet's sake, and otherwise they talk about it
you gotta use remedies against the drug with it
this is the really poisonous
toxic stuff, and even its name indicates
it's a poison, because what happens
when the cows, that's where the boo comes from
when the cows eat it, they disiliere
they disiliere, what does that mean
it means they explode
it means they explode, they vent
you've heard of the word
dehis
when you have a surgery and you've been cut open
you don't want that closed
tissue to open up again
this is what they're trying to prevent, is the opening of the tissue
what happens, there is a
bursting, there is a bursting with the cattle
now
I used to work on a dairy, I didn't see any cattle burst
I did see some die from bloat
and I know that's a possibility
but that is not what this author is talking about
when a cow dies from bloat, they don't explode anyway
this is what happens, his blank
spill out of his body
let's go to the next one
people I want you to meet really quick here
look at the Greek
what is this
this is the art of healing with ointments, you didn't even know this existed did you
you didn't even know it existed
we're talking about using ointments
crazy drug ointments
let's see some crazy drug ointments
I know you guys love the crazy
look at the Yatra Maya is a feminine physician
isn't that nice, so for those of you who think women didn't do it
they were in medicine
love it, give me the next one
fairyac says plenty
is the name given to a preparation devised by luxury, a composition formed of
600 different ingredients, and this while nature has bestowed upon
such numbers of remedies, each of which would have fully answered the purpose
employed by itself, the mythrodatic antidote
is composed of 4 and 50 ingredients
now listen to this, 54 ingredients
used in exactly the same proportion
and the quantity prescribed is in some cases so small
as the 60th part of one denarius
right, we're in the world of grams now
we're talking about antiquity
and the complex compound drugs that they're using
in mystery rites, and the measurements are that
precise, you know where they're getting that
precision, that's bronze age, late bronze age precision with
pharmacology, this is why when somebody comes on
and they say I don't like his kitchen
you know that there are certain people out there
that you can show that reality to, you can give it
to them and they'll say thank you
to other people who already have a pre-formed notion
right, you can stand them in front of the mirror
this is Bacchic initiation
this is Bacchic initiation
people are forced to look into the mirror
look at what Ms. Typebox did tonight
right, she talked about things she had no
clue, no knowledge of, whatsoever and dismissed
it entirely, just dismissed
that's the same thing the leaders of the theology
schools do, it's the same thing
that Jordan Peterson does
they come from outside the field
and condemn and just deny
everything, look at his kitchen
do you see why Socrates was walking around like he was
and why the oracle was saying he was the wisest
Athenian who walked around saying these people
don't know what they're doing, you don't know what justice is
you don't know what justice is, all you have to do is look at your
basic definitions, everything that you think
is right will be turned on its head
and you'll see just from the scientific breakdown of your own stupid thoughts
by the power of reason, you're an idiot
and if you haven't come to that place yet
you end up, you know, you end up
saying look at the man's kitchen, here's my kitchen of that
right, if that's your level, if that's your level of depth
right, but the ancient mysteries and the women who made them
the oracles who perpetuated them
you do them a great
disservice, Miss Typebox, you do them a great disservice
and they're watching you, they're watching
you, fantastic, let's go to the next one
right, let's go to the next one, that was not very
scary, look let's get down to here, do this one real quick, do this one
look people, what bug are we talking about, we're talking about Spanish fly
right, the term Spanish fly, thank you Alan
the term Spanish fly is referred to various aphrodisiacs
oh I forgot to tell you, this is their big aphrodisiac
like the cantharides, the blister beetle
right, they produce that chemical, what does it do
let's see, however the real Spanish fly contains a hazardous substance
that can blister your skin right and can kill you too
are you ready, give me the next one, watch what happens, remember by the way
by the way Pliny was talking about how specific
the amounts are that they're working with right, because they know
why do they have to be that specific, because they know if they give too much
they'll kill you, watch what happens, where does it come from, true Spanish
fly is made from blister beetles, specifically the substance produced
by the beetles is called cantharidin, John Scarborough
wrote about cantharidin and what it does and how it interacts
with the prostate, the insects name is not for nothing
contact with cantharidin, blisters the skin
now you know why, they call
it the burning purple, guess what this drug
is one of the ones they use for cancer treatment, external cancer treatment
okay
contact with cantharidin, blisters skin, its use dates
way back and some of its many infamous fans include
a Roman Empress who used cantharidin to encourage sexual behavior
worthy of blackmailing her family, that's nice, Roman Gladiator
is using it for orgies, wasn't just Gladiators, Queens
who used it on their kings and those kings on their mistresses
now he says to spice things up
but watch what's happening, this is not intentional
dried beetles would be crushed and mixed with drinks or sweets
not always to the receiver's knowledge, what do you think
Cersei was putting on those pigs food
putting the blister beetle, you know you can kill someone
like that, right, yeah and every once in a while they do
they do, when Medea went to the temple of Hera
to dedicate her children, couple of them didn't make it through
the process, those children were dedicated to Hera
okay, they're working with very dangerous
chemicals, very dangerous, none of that he talks about
fumigating this one, I don't know how that would change it, I don't know what that would
do, but it gets crazy, okay give me the next one after that one, yeah
along with long lasting erections, Spanish fly was found
to cause a number for serious side effects, including
death, so if we had a commercial for Spanish fly
today we would have to have somebody read, you know this includes serious side effects
including death, right, even death as the
Marquis de Sade tragically discovered in 1772
after giving sweet and a seed balls laced with Spanish fly
to prostitutes,
why would he be giving Spanish fly to the prostitutes
because as anyone knew in antiquity
especially the women who were involved
with the midwifery, there's a way to make
a woman's body heated, there's
a way to fill your heated center
and to cause you to burst into flames
yes, I saw this done once in an interview
I saw it done once in an interview, the photographer was surprised, spontaneous
combustion, right on the spot, right on the spot
it was fantastic, love it
this is the power of the drug
this is the power of the drug that they're talking about
a power to force you
to be brought to a place of
climactic perfection
and it all starts they say with your
heat, right, it all starts with your heat
and how that heat can be focused and where it can be focused
and the drug does just that
it takes it to the part of your body
now what does it do in men, it just happens to have, now this drug
is first for a woman, it's not a man's drug
but when you give it to men, you get saders
you get saders, give me the next
look at what are the symptoms that we get here
people, urination, pain for urination
when you're in a psychotic fit, that's no fun, blood in your urine
vomiting blood, you're going to get the clue here, there's a lot of blood
coming out of different places, difficulty swallowing, seriously
difficulty, are you kidding, I've got blood coming out of places
I don't care how hard it is, priapism, fancy talk
this author said, persistent pain for erections
they also call it satiriasis, they have numerous words
for it because it's a common drug activity
you can cause this person to have a painful
unremitting erection, causes abdominal pain
eventually kidney failure, some gastrointestinal bleeding
you get a lot of bleeding out the anus with it
a lot of bleeding out the anus and then some
neurological, as you shoot down
as you shoot down the slide of death
go ahead and put some of our pictures up there, as you shoot down the slide of death
eventually it takes your nervous
tissue and turns it into not good
it kills you, and how does it kill you
causes you to shed
that essential life that flows
from that
body under the influence of the drug
it pushes you to a place of climax
you say, every place of climax that you want to go, you want to go there yourself
this is an invasive
proposition that we've got going
we're in antiquity and we're going through these rites, I'm going to drug you
I've read many many examples of people
praise this as drugging people
so I'm going to drug you and I'm going to
forcefully, I'm going to forcefully
climax you, you're not going to want it
you're going to be in a psychotic state and I'm going to cause you to come to that place
of complete and total
sexual union with cosmos
you're going to see how everything works when we take you there, you're going to understand the machinery
you're going to understand your hard drive, you're going to understand what's happening
that is what they're performing
now what are they doing that with, one of the components are these
blister beetles, give me the next one
go back to that plenty one
I wanted you to see here
that plenty is like
these people are just bragging because it's impossible to get those tiny, tiny amounts of measurements
he's so amazed at how the level of the science
has reached in pharmacology
we have accounts of people, doctors
who accidentally overdose patients
we have accounts of it and it's not pretty but it's happening
there's no FDA there
there's no regulations there
give me the next one
as to the other media virtues attributed to bugs
because you think we're dealing with bugs for the cure of vomiting
people you can use bugs to stop vomiting
people don't know what cordon fever here is but it's a malaria
it's a type of malaria
they have chronic fevers, populations of chronic fevers
and they notice, hey there's a
there's a relation here between how many of us have fevers
and how many of the swamps we're cleaning up
and all this malaria, this bad air
that means bad air
the big picture look, the holistic look that they've got
of the world around them, you're part of a system
you're part of a system and you are balanced within that system
and we can give you drugs to bring you to places that you can't be brought otherwise
watch what happens
what do we find, what do we use bugs to treat
I look upon them as utterly unfounded and not worthy of
further notice, they are employed however for the treatment of lathergy
there we go, lathergy that's interesting, you want a little pick me up
drink some bug juice and with some fair reason
as they successfully neutralize the narcotic effects of the poison
of the asp
so wait a minute, this is not some dude who's just walking along
it's bitten by an asp, this is a dude who is using the
asp and he's countering that asp with this
anti-narcotic
with this anti-narcotic
do you see how sophisticated the plant, the flora and fauna
bridge was with these people and it's coming through the
greek, it's not coming through the latin, I'm giving you a latin source but it's coming through the greek
from the viper are prepared, nobody ever believes me when I say
these things, so here they are in their words, from the viper are
prepared those tablets which are known as theriac to the greeks
again who are we talking about, just plenty
he's just giving us the encyclopedia of the day
he's Mr. Encyclopedia, he's going to talk about magic and medicine
he's going to talk about drugs and god he goes on and on and on
give me the next one, give me the next one
a pounded scorpion, this is just for fun for those of you who want something fun to think about
a pounded scorpion, it's got to be pounded
this thing can't be drowned and peppered
it's got to be pounded
and it neutralizes the venom of a spotted lizard, I don't even know what kind of spotted lizard that is
in most of these texts you'll look at the notes
and I'll say we don't know what species this is, it's probably this one
right because it's in this region that he's describing
oh yeah they have this spotted lizard
but you can use the scorpion venom
so now you understand why in the mythrodatic depictions
of the god, you've always got like scorpion
I'm going to scorpion trying to sting his testicles
yeah
you use the venoms as compounds
right, use them as compounds, now remember
when you have the blister beetle on board
and you are bleeding anally, I want you to just wait
you're bleeding anal, crimson blood
this is not the black blood you get from any intestine higher up
this is that crimson anal blood
and that mixes with purple
do you know what's happening, that purple is getting absorbed
that purple is getting absorbed
they're mixing in your own body, they're mixing drugs
is
Christ, is Christ a drug term?
seriously people, seriously I can't
count, I can't count the references
of course it is
and notice, I want to say one thing
when we have Jesus in company
notice that people won't go back and actually look
for themselves, notice there's a fear
a palpable fear in looking at
the original text, there's a fear that you may find something
let's figure out what's going on with Judas here because we know
we're in the cult, we know, give me that next one, there you go
watch this people, hear the remedies
that you can derive from canthardes, you mean that blister beetle
a terrible forceful erection that makes my anus bleed
in different parts of my body bleed, I've got to come and
get me the purple, you mean those kinds can be used
as remedies, but with reference to canthardes
there's been considerable controversy on the subject seeing that
taken internally, there are poisons attended with excruciating
pains in the bladder, that's nice to know
then it keeps going, I just wanted you to see that you can
talk about remedies derived from these very same
poisons, which they know are poisonous
and canthardes are produced from small grub found
most particularly in the spongy excrescences which grow on the
stem of the dog rose, isn't that interesting, why the dog rose?
and still more abundantly on the ash, other kinds again are found upon
the white rose, look at how observant they are and this is just
plenty, what is he doing, he is a slave
read to him all day long, while he's doing
government business, he is a slave follow him around and read to him
when he's in the bath, slave read to him
and then he takes all that information and piles it into encyclopedia
that's what he's doing here, so it's not that he knows this right, he's picked
it up from another author and what does that tell you, it tells you
kiddies you've been lied to by these lying
people
the people who told you, nobody reads an antiquity
I heard somebody, some septuagent expert
quote unquote, oh god
nobody, nobody reads an antiquity
what are you talking about, what are you talking about
look at all the information that's slammed into this, that plenty is
gleaning, what do you think he's getting those scrolls, they got all sorts of
libraries all over Rome, they got one on the palette
time, Christians burn it down
oh god, give me the next one, we gotta decipher the mystery
mystery, all these insects are extremely
efficacious for the cure of blank and blank, it is said too that the act is a
minagogue and diuretic, for which lastries and hypocrites used to prescribe
them for dropsy, that's swelling, inflammation, extra swelling
Cato was reproached, now listen to this, everybody loves Cato
because he's totally conservative, totally conservative
this guy's a farmer and he thinks that the land has taught him
everything and he's just come out of the ground
and what happens, watch what happens, Cato of Utica
was reproached, was selling poison because when disposing
of a royal property by auction, he sold a quantity of
cantharides at the price of 60,000
cisterces, dude
if they came to your state
and found 60,000 cisterces worth of drugs
what do you think is gonna, now an antiquity
right, it's only looked down upon because that stuff is so toxic
but he's got a whole bunch of sex drug in this house
a lot of sex drug, hopefully he's got a lifetime supply of sex drug
he's not, it's so much that he can't use all of them
self, that's for, you know, that's for other people
you mean these Romans, these famous Romans or drug dealers
yes, they are because there's no laws against it
and if you are free
you can take cantharides, you can
yeah, they don't want that stuff to be regulated, that's your health
that's your health, that's between you and your physician
wait a minute, they said that in antiquity, yes
yes, tyranny always takes that away
it always takes away your choice, doesn't matter
if it's your vote
yeah, give me the next one
give me the next one, I hate it Martha when he talks about it, come here Fred
you midwestern, god, he needs it so bad
take Martha home Fred, aphrodisiacs, let's see
in its natural form, cantharadon is secreted by the male blister beetle and given to the female
as a compulsory gift during mating, afterwards the female
beetle covers her eggs with it, defense against predators, fantastic
right, look at it, nature is gorgeous man, if you can't watch this and say
holy mackerel, nature is gorgeous, give it to me
the French surgeon
Ambrose Pell, described a case in 1572
of a man suffering from the most
satirized, why is it frightful satirized?
do you want to be the
one guy with frightful satirizes?
first of all
satirizes is priapism, it's a painful
unremitting erection
why are there
degrees of it, and why do you not want to be
or want to be that person with it, the most
frightful satirizes, after taking a potion composed of
nettles, yeah, and a
cantharad extract, so he's taking the blister beetle plus the
nettles, which I know they used to nettle in their sex rites
so it's doing something right, this dude is on to his, the surgeon is on to
his stuff, this is perhaps the same man of whom
Parr relates that a courtesan
sprinkled a cantharad powder on food she served to him
after which the man experienced, get ready for this
violent priapism and anal bleeding
of which he later died
of which he later died
of which he later also cites the case of a priest who died
after swallowing a dose of cantharadis
which he intended to fortify his sex drive
wait, what, was that, wait, was that a catholic priest
a catholic priest fortifying his sex drive
too much, too much
it's just too much, do you see how the devil
works, it's overwhelming, you mean you can be given a frightful
priapism, you can be given a torturous priapism
and then be forced to burst
yes you can, yes you can
and it's part of the mystery
cantharadis is being used, blister beetle is being used
and there are descriptions of it both in Latin and Greek
what it is doing exactly
what it is doing with Judas
let's see the next one, okay, bring it, we gotta bring it
I'll tie it back together carefully
I just want to see this one, look, they're using some remedies that you wouldn't necessarily
consider remedies like rams flesh, right, broth
rams flesh, broth, right, okay, so in other words
crazy aroused inducer, what does it do with women
it just causes you to burst, to get really hot and burst
what you know has its
advantages
right, but look what you can do
you kind of have some rams flesh, some sheeps milk
very useful in cases where persons of drunken infusion of aconite
oh my god, aconite
that's wolf's pain, that stuff will kill you dead
we've been looking at aconite, it's one of those poisons that they use
specifically, that thing will knock you the hell out
that's it, you're gone, aconite, look they're drinking it, so wait a minute
now what I gotta do, I gotta get my blister beetle and I gotta get some
some of this, I gotta mix it all together apparently and some of the sheeps milk
right, or look, you know people who've got the
buprestis in there already, what would you be drinking at
aconite and buprestis for, Nero knew
why do you think he wanted the formula so bad
give me the next one, this is a mystery term by Heracles, I'm gonna do
this for the first time tonight, I know I said short story and it's getting long
and I wanna bring you, I wanna bring you to the climax
but I wanna give you a mystery term, are you ready people
this is a line by Heracles
and what does he say
that is a mystery
statement, if you can understand that
you will understand what the initiate must undergo
give me the next one, sometimes we leave it with mystery
people what happened, now take us back
wait should we take us back to the very first verse that we had
that's our quote for the evening, not that one, that one, give me that one
no not that one either, this one, there we go
this is our ax 118 and finally we're gonna find out what happened to
Judas, what happened to Judas, he bought this
plot of land, he's gonna settle down, he's got some money
he bought this plot of land from his, that he got from his
turning in Jesus, and what happened
Prenes genominos, Prenes genominos, he became
what, he became Prenes, now hit me with the definition
good, what did he become, which is actually
this is from Prenes, but that's just the length of the vowels, look the
Ionian lengthens it, alright, the Ionian lengthens
it, okay good, that's what it says, with the face
downwards, lying on the front, falling forwards, head long
down, oh my god, look at the bottom, look at the bottom
the very bottom line
Fortase, what is that, that fort, it's Fortase
it's Latin for perhaps, they're trying to explain
these are Victorian scholars trying to explain
how this word is being used
in the Acts of the Apostles, and they have to put in parentheses
Fortase, perhaps, this is from
preces, becoming
distended, distended, hit me with the next one
distended, watch this people, this word
equals pretho to blow up or distend, and what
kind of authors are using it to mean to blow up or distend
look at the end of the first line, the Acts of the Apostles
this is a different passage, 286, you know what that means, it means
this one author is using this term
this way consistently
and who else is using it, Hippocratic Nature of Women
Hippocratic Nature of Women
is the author of Acts using a medical
term, Yep, and that author is using it repeatedly
the same way, okay, give me the next one
now, here is the verb from which it comes
right, pimpremi
and notice that it can mean to burn with fever
can mean to burn, the whole idea of
burning and the swelling are combined, they talk about
love burns me, I can feel the love in
my loins, right, when they say can you feel the love
tonight, they were talking about a burning sensation in your genitalia
can you feel the love tonight
it's the burning in classical antiquity
it's the burning, can you feel the burning, you know what that burning attracts
moisture, it attracts moisture
what are we doing with the
confidus, what are we doing with the confidus, that beetle
that causes us to be able to come to a forced
climax while our anus
bleeds
watch this, give me the next one, give me the next one
where we were, buprestis animal
look what he says, this is plenty, buprestis is a
you know, it's kind of rare in Italy, right, and it's very similar to the scarab
and it really escapes the cow's notice
right, it falls in among the herbs and the cows eat it
and what happens when the cows eat it, they become inflamed
they become surging
and they rupt, they burst
they burst from that inner surge, why?
it's in the chemicals, it's in the chemicals, it's all that
interaction, right, and again, I worked down a dairy
I'll tell you for a fact, I've never seen a cow explode, and I've seen many
not many, but a handful die of bloat
where they literally cannot give off any more gas
they actually just choke themselves, right, they just suffocate themselves
there's no explosion
we're talking about bringing the person to the place where they can spill
their goodies, are you ready, give me the next one
are you ready, oh god, you mean Judas, remember when Judas got
angry, oh we're gonna see that in a minute, okay look, from the
viper they make a pastel, right, which they call a theriac
right, and the Greeks say that these things are
poisons, right, I just want you to see, the Romans are well aware
of the capacity the Greeks have for using the theriacs
when the woman is seated on the beast, that beast is that
theriac, give me the next one
it's gorgeous, I love it, okay, I know people it's getting, I thought it would go
slower, this is what you're doing, you're becoming
preines, you're becoming
distended, you mean Judas
didn't just follow, look, he was at the sale, right Chewie
he was at the sale of the property and the
realtor there was like congratulations, you just bought your first
town and he was like, ah, and his guts exploded and
just spilled out in front of him, like an exorcist or something
right, concomitantly with Jesus on the cross, now
the author of Matthew knew, right, that he had to have
a death scene, this scene in Acts doesn't talk about
doesn't say explicitly Judas died
it doesn't, strangely enough
strangely enough, the Matthew scene does and in Matthew
he just, he feels bad, but he's like, oh, he doesn't buy a
lot of land so he can party, right, he does what
he hangs himself, right, because he feels bad
he feels bad, this is not the death scene
there's no death here, so what's happening
he's swelling, he's swelling and what happens after that
he bursts in the mids, he burst
in the mids, have you ever bursted in your mids, I'm gonna burst
in, I'm gonna fall over the place, you know what I mean
that's how we all get here, right
that's how we all get here, give me the next one
and what happens, he pours out, what is flowing out
what is flowing out of this guy, what is he
give it to me, cheer me to the next one, what is flowing out of this guy
was pouring out of him, all of that
goody, good, good stuff coming from the
oracular, yummies
oh, remember last week with Theocris, a couple
episodes ago, we talked about, we tracked it down, we talked about Paul and his
thorn and the flesh and everything that he's doing with the boy, goody goods
you didn't think we'd get away from him, did you
you didn't think we'd get away from him, and people say
how can you take, how can you read that, listen to these
brainiacs, how can you read that definition and take something from
a part of it, right, Dan, Dan who is
how can you take
something from the back side of the definition, look at this all the way to the bottom, oh well let's just cut
that part out like that, right, it's one word we're talking about and that word
has a history, and if you don't understand how that word is used through history
you don't read Greek, I'm sorry, I'm sorry you don't
right, for everybody, for everybody who wants
that accent to be something that I said it wasn't, good luck
good luck, 35 years, right
this is where I can help you get, give it to me, I'm giving
them all the stuff, I don't care, I'm not gonna sell anything
give me that, watch this people, this is a, look this is me
and I told you this before, I told you this before
when we talk about the seed of those feelings, those splachna
do you know what's coming out, give me the next one, do you know what's coming out
he's purging, he's purging
watch this, I told you
who po splachnoi si paidos
those, those passions
those are those passions, do you see what you can do with that
pice, you can cause those passions
to come to fruition, you realize
take it down for a second, you realize the Olympic games
the Olympic games were there
in the presence of the games of Hera
the games of Hera, and what were those games, those were
education games, those were coming of age games
for girls, yeah
the schools that started on lesbos
for girls, those are the earliest forms of education
your society
your western society is built upon a library
that was brought to you by women
honest man religions could tear down and burn
give me one, we're gonna have two more
two more then we'll call it cause people are tired, I know that
what did I, what is that, that sounds dirty, remember those people
I wanted you to think of the perineum, what is the perineum
that's that place, remember we talked about this, that's the place between
your anus and your genitalia
it's that flat land, it's that flat land, okay
give me the next one, your glutes, right, under your glutes
what are those centaurs, they're lace-dye
they're pedarasts, Jesus Christ
I said this a long time ago
you were with me, you've been with me the whole way
and I said to you, you trusted me, I told you
the centaurs, those are those traffickers, they are the
pedarasts, when you say lace-dace
you are saying pedarast
you are saying somebody who abuses and
traffics children, who abuses them sexually
using drugs just like the one
that we just looked at, just like the one we just looked at
do you know what he was doing
give me that last one, do you know what he was doing
he was
in that field blown up with the
buprestis bursting and
spilling out a seed while our Lord Jesus Christ
was dying, and Peter is the one who relates
this tale, why?
because we all know he's dead, what happened Peter, were you a witness
to it, no, all we
know is that he spilled everything
that blood came out and that's all there was, he was OD
you mean Judas Iscariot and Jesus Christ
were both under the influence of drugs
when they died
supposedly, yes
yes, this is how the language
works, this is how you
express that performance of the mystery
and you don't see it because there is a
gulf between us and them and the only bridge
between that gulf is that thing that you and I have in common
blah blah blah
the only way we get there is through the language
when I tell people Jesus is saying I'm not a
pedarast, I'm not a child
I'm not a child trafficker
I can pull up a text for you and I can show you the text
and you can, you know, be convinced or not
but the fact is you are the people
who want to take that trip, you're the people
who want to look into that reality, not the ones who want to say
his kitchen, look at his kitchen, what
a bunch of impoverishment, I'm going to save that for next time, I want to end with a quote
I asked Dr. Carl Brock
I asked him, give me a quote, I've got a bunch of
Greek students now and I want to encourage them
tell me as a classicist, tell me something, he said
I consider ancient Greek the prototypical humanity
he just sent me this in his email, I'm putting it up there
like it's a quote, but he just emailed me this, the language
and the cultural fantasies encoded in its mythological traditions
have provided the nomenclature for many of the well-known
psychological paradigms, for example the edema
complex, but the art in literature
this is the part I like, unlike the tormenting delusions
of psychosis or the products not
of a diseased mind, but the highest aspirations
of our creative spirit or soul, thank you
the highest aspirations of our creative spirit
or soul, thank you, this is from a man
that was from a man who has spent
many many years studying
reading Greek, he has a taste for it and a flavor
he has an understanding of it that you cannot
parallel, we should consider him
a modern
savior, it's his knowledge, it's that
knowledge, it's that ability to work with that Greek
that brings us to that savior
definitely, love it and you can have that too
keep working on the Greek, keep working, I know
I've got classes coming up and I know I'm still
planting the Aussie class and I love it, thank you very much
and I still got some adding to the European class, people are working hard
people are working hard and I appreciate it and we're going to go full
steam ahead and when someone like Peterson has the guts
to come out
and to discuss what those texts say
we'll be there, keep telling everybody that you run into
keep telling them, if they say talk about Jesus
you talk about Jesus too, take back the Bible people
this is our chance to take back the Bible, I thank you very
much for coming tonight and I hope
that you can see the reality that is
in those texts because it's always so much better
unfortunately not for the monists because that's where all of the evidence
against them is, thank you for coming
tonight, Hail Satan
I fly the man who laughs
