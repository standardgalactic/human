Sunday morning, dark clouds rising, oh there's no sunshine anywhere, strong winds blowing,
God give us wisdom to grasp the message in the air,
oh if I could have one wish and know that it would come true,
and wish that God would give us strength to know just what to do,
then we could tear down the fences that fence us all in,
fences created by such evil men,
then we could tear down the fences that fence us all in,
maybe we could walk together again.
Welcome back to Satanic Initiation on Lady Babylon.
Tonight what we have more and more and more for you is that tomb.
Remember that tomb we went to?
That place with the dank.
We're going back there tonight.
We're going back there tonight.
We're going to see.
I can hear the beat.
We're going to see the boys.
Can you hear them?
Can you see them?
Let's see the boys.
We're going to see Jesus and all the boys tonight,
but tonight we're going to go to a place that's a little bit familiar to us.
We've had it introduced,
but now we're going to look at it through the lens of the post Jesus Christ
transdimensional indictment.
Yeah, we're going to look at it through the eyes of the investigators tonight
on Lady Babylon.
If you have anything against Jesus.
Or against prostitution.
You probably shouldn't watch tonight because that's where we have to go.
We're going to the boys of Jesus and I want us to see them as a troop tonight.
Right.
As a gang, they got called out.
They got called out by the Pideski.
Those prostitutes.
They recognize them.
Remember, we're talking about child prostitutes in the between the ages of 10 and 13 history,
the Bible, Jesus Christ and prostitutes, prostitutes.
Let's look at those boys tonight in order to do it.
We got to blow this place.
We got to cleanse it.
Oh, those vapors are awful.
Bring on that sulfur baby and let's see the madness in Malina.
Yeah.
We have a Greek text that will tell you Malina way is Medea.
It's one of her cult names and if you're in and you're initiated, you know why.
Isn't that fantastic tonight?
Let's dive in.
Look, the time ship has stopped.
Let's step out.
Here we are.
We're at a place that has to do with brothels and tombs and Jesus Christ.
This is fantastic.
Let's go there with our first source.
Chewie hit it.
Here we go.
I'm going to dedicate this word tonight.
This is our one Greek word I want everybody to remember.
Remember how I told you that ancient Greek has a far more expansive vocabulary than your
English.
Yes.
Yes.
Far more expansive.
So what is the concept I want to feature for you tonight to allow your brain to grow into it?
Look, what is this?
Fusichladeon.
What is Fusichladeon?
It's a spell to open.
Fusichladeon.
Now, we know that the Victorians, despite the prudery, were way deep into it.
They were way deep into it.
Look what they put.
How do we know this?
Because they know all the naughtiness.
Yes.
Where's the naughtiness here?
It asked.
Thank you, Latin.
Pudendum muliebra.
Wait a minute.
What?
That's the female secret parts.
The female secrets.
Isn't that nice?
That's a nice way to express the female secrets.
Yes.
Okay.
That's our key.
That's our key to nature.
What?
You mean this word is a spell?
Who is putting a spell on someone?
I just want people to look at the anthropology.
Bring that up again.
Yeah.
I want you to look at the anthropology here.
Look, it's made up of Clay's key and Fusus's nature.
Literally, it's a spell.
It's a song to open up the secret parts of a woman.
They have a word for that?
Yeah.
They have a word for that.
And we've got to know this stuff.
If we're going to get inside with the initiates, we've got to know this stuff.
Right.
This is our vocabulary.
Fantastic.
Okay.
They're going to meet us at the door.
The apostles.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Hear it?
Yeah.
It's going to be a little bit loud.
You're going to have to shout a little bit.
We're going in.
Yeah.
Here they are.
Ready?
Give me the next text.
Oh.
Up it.
Up it.
Ghost.
Summon.
I summon the ghost.
Of who?
Who is this guy?
Clement.
Clement.
We're that stinky.
Come here, Clement.
Come here.
Oh, you like the stroma taste.
By the way, it's not the stroma itself.
That's a wrong stroma taste.
You like it, don't you?
Moses.
Shut up and sit down.
You love it.
I love this part.
Watch this.
We're going to bring in.
We're going to bring in.
Oh, God.
This is a man who rejected his parents' paganism.
He was on the inside.
He was on the inside.
He knows all the terminology.
He's the one who comes forward, you know?
And he's got this letter.
He's got this letter to Theodore.
He got to straighten things, some things out with the Christian mystery.
Let's see what they had to straighten out.
Bring it up.
Yep.
Bring it up.
Good.
That's a lot of letters, you know, that dude.
And it's too, you know, it's too Theodore.
And what does it say?
He says, you did a great job, Teddy.
You did a great job stifling those unspeakable teachings of the
Carpecrations.
You did a great job.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
You did a great job.
Fantastic.
What?
Who are the Carpecrations?
Oh, they know how to party.
They know how to open nature.
They know how to open nature.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, love it.
Love it, here we go, here we go.
Let's get another text, it's overwhelming.
The nature's overwhelming.
Here we go, look at this, look at this bad boy.
Yeah, so this is also from the same Clement, right?
And he's saying, you know, while Mark was with Peter
doing their thing in Rome, he published,
it's like register on a grapho.
It's more like register, but I don't know.
I think publish is a good rendering.
He published the deeds of the Lord, the doings.
Now mind you, I'm translating, mind you,
he didn't translate them all, right?
He didn't let people know everything.
He particularly didn't give away any of the mystery rights.
Okay, okay, the mystic stuff.
He didn't betray it, right?
Now what's the problem?
Theodore wants to know, what's all this sexy stuff, sir?
And he's like, don't worry, daddy, don't worry, daddy.
It's okay.
He says, Jesus, talk about naked on naked.
What do you do naked on naked?
Theodore's like, why did he talk about naked with naked?
And it's okay, Clement says, look, look.
I mean, these are the leading Christians of the time, people,
right?
Look, it's okay.
You stifled the carpacrations, right?
That'll take the Roman heat off our backs.
Good, good, fantastic.
Now, he didn't give away, Mark didn't give away the secrets.
He didn't give them away.
There are some things that you don't tell.
Did you just, you keep quiet?
It's a mystery, bonehead.
Fantastic, fantastic, right?
We as initiates, silence.
You ever seen a Catholic priest try to silence someone?
Yeah, that's the energy that you're gleaning from that.
That's psychic vampirism.
You're gonna love that.
You're gonna have respect for the craft
that's able to prune the psychology
to send the voices out there.
Can you do that?
Molina way.
Let's go to the next one.
Let's go to the next one.
Here we go.
You're gonna see it.
I told you guys would see it.
It's from Luke.
Let's just read what happens.
So, you know, Jacob, John, you know, James and John,
those sons of Zebedee, you know,
they were associates, it says, with Simon, okay?
Indicating some kind of guild thing.
This coin, Nonoi, is usually referring to tax collectors.
So it's tax farmers, harvesters, you could say.
So it's kind of like a scheme, right?
Right?
That's why Jesus is always telling them,
don't get scandalized, don't get caught, right?
Okay, here we go.
What does he say?
They're associates, you know, with Simon.
And Jesus says, don't be afraid, Peter, right?
He's telling.
Don't be afraid.
I'm gonna make you a zogron, a zogron.
You're gonna make me a zogron of men.
I'm gonna make you a zogron of human meat.
Are you ready for this?
Watch the next.
What is a zogron?
I tell all my students, everything in Greek
goes back to the verbs.
If you want the real stuff, go to the verb.
Yeah, yeah, to save a life, to take captive, yeah.
To capture somebody alive, right?
Take a living captive.
What?
To restore life and strength.
Okay, okay, give me the next word.
What do we have here?
I just want you to look at the etymology now.
Where is this word coming from?
Where is it coming from?
The Victorians put right here.
It's coming from Zoe and Aguero.
Remember, that's the name of Ewa, Zoe.
Isn't that nice?
Guess what guys, Ewa is Greek.
Eve in the garden of Edim, it's all Greek.
There's not a lick of Hebrew in it, period.
Yeah, isn't that interesting?
Ewa, fantastic, it's that Bacchic shout.
And those guys knew it.
Eusebius was writing it down saying,
this is the way it is.
That Ewa is that mystic shout.
That's the name of Eve, says Eusebius.
Right, fantastic.
I told you guys that,
but it took him a while to get here.
He's lazy.
Eusebius is the laziest.
For having written as much as he did,
it's one of the laziest people on the planet.
He steals stuff too.
Credit, dudes.
Go ahead.
Yep, yeah, so anyway, Zoe and Aguero.
What we have people, you can take that.
What I just wanted to point out is that we have the life
that is rising from a state of death.
What do you do when you agate or someone?
When Jesus walks up,
how does he bring those dead boys back to life?
He awakens them.
He awakens them.
Let's see it.
You wanna see where he's getting with the boys?
Here it is.
Here it is, people.
Are you ready?
So I'm gonna start just the time.
I'm just gonna translate it quickly
because I want you to hear the flow of the story.
Yeah, blow it up for me, Chewie.
Are you ready?
So Jesus got pissed off
and he went out with her to the garden
where the memorial was
and immediately he heard from the tomb a great voice.
And Jesus, you know, coming up,
he rolled off the stone from the front of the thing
and went inside and right away,
there was this little kid.
There was this little kid.
Jesus stretched out his hand and he agated him.
Take it down for a second, Chewie.
He awakened him.
He brought him from a place of unconscious reality
to a place of conscious reality.
That is the Greek.
Now, the only reason I know this is from Greek sources.
When you expose yourself over and over and over again
to this language,
you develop a flavor for the vocabulary
and it's very easy to see.
My friends who claim you shouldn't do that.
Classical philologists get to where they are
with sweat and blood.
You should give credit
and you shouldn't be dressing up like a police officer
and pulling people over if you're not a police officer.
Yes, fantastic.
Let's do this then.
Okay, keep looking.
I want everybody to focus on the shenanigans.
Yeah, what's going on in line 57?
There was this little kid
and Jesus stresses out his hand.
He raises him from that unconscious state.
Now, remember the kid's unconscious
but Jesus is hearing voices from the grave.
He's hearing voices from the grave.
Do you know this little kid is not the only one in here?
Did you ever notice that?
These guys are crowding around these tombs,
getting on those torches with the fumigations,
getting wild.
No, no, no, go ahead, blow it up to me.
Let's keep translating.
Isn't it lovely?
So there's this little kid there.
Now watch this, watch this.
Oh, God.
Says with his hand, right?
With his hand that has that power.
That's how he raises him.
That's a magic expression, people.
Jesus is doing magic.
The guy who translated this,
who found this manuscript,
said, Jesus is a magician.
And here he is, sorcerer Jesus.
Are you ready?
And the young boy looked down at him
and fell in love.
And he began to beg him.
He began to beg Jesus.
Then he might be with him.
Okay.
Yeah, wait.
Is this a text, an ancient text?
We're gonna categorize it.
Pseudo, pseudo something.
I don't care, it's a text.
And the vocabulary happens to fit very well,
very well.
If this thing has any doubt or question about it,
as a classical philologist, it is exquisite.
It is exquisite.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Interesting style.
Love it.
Let's go back to it and see that text again.
I'll keep translating.
Okay, hold on, people.
The kid falls in love with him.
He says, let me be with you, right?
And so they left.
They get up and they left the tomb
and they came to the house of this kid.
And this is a little bit distressing.
Yeah, I've hanged out with Lucius.
What is the, because he was rich?
Yeah, yeah, he was a rich kid.
Okay, whatever.
I don't know what's going on, but this is a party
and it's in a nice place and Jesus is there.
And what happens?
And after six days, Jesus gives this kid
specific instruction.
So Jesus is staying on the compound, right?
With this kid that has been begging him to be with them.
And what happens when evening comes
after Jesus gave him these instructions?
The little kid comes to him and he is,
look, it's line 62.
He is covering his Gumnos.
He's covering his, you remember those secret parts
of the woman?
Yes, you have the same things in the boy.
You have the secret parts.
Yeah, and he's got a bandage.
He's got a bandage on his secret parts.
Yeah, oh my goodness.
Wait, and he was in the tomb?
Okay, you've seen it, but now, right?
We've been here before.
This is just memory for us.
What I want you to focus on is the prostitution
behind it, the bigger picture.
That's what I want you to focus on.
With these associates of Jesus,
together in an enterprise, working together.
You wondered why it was that John lives
until like 90 something, right?
You're like, why is he so old?
It's because when he was with Jesus,
he was a child.
He was a child prostitute.
The apostles of Jesus Christ
are child prostitutes working for a trafficker
who is using a mystic drug.
Fantastic, fantastic, good job, Jesus.
Right, now you know why he got indicted.
Let's go back up.
People will find out, right?
You don't have to wait until the end.
Let's go back to that same source.
And I just want you guys to see what happens.
They go to the house after six days.
He gives them these instructions.
He comes in, he's got that thing wrapped around his hoo-ha.
And what does he do?
He stays with Jesus.
Everybody on my Greek class on 63, line 63.
Look at that nice accusative duration of time, right?
Extent of time, love this.
He stayed there with him the whole night long.
And what happened with Jesus?
Jesus taught him, Jesus taught him.
Look at the bottom line, the mystery of the kingdom of God.
Take it down, yeah.
Okay, all right.
Within the context of the child sex slave trade, right?
All of these apostles of Jesus have left
their homes or neighborhoods
or wherever they were associated with.
Join themself to Jesus, yeah, okay.
Okay, let's go to the next text.
I want us to see.
Everybody, this is another word
that I just want to introduce you to.
This is gorgeous.
Look at this orgia, right?
I've told you guys about these orgia.
What is Jesus doing with the boy
when he's teaching him the mystery, right?
Which the text just said he was doing.
Blow this up, Chewie.
I want to be able to read to people.
These are the secret rites,
the secret worship practiced by the initiated
used of the worship of Demeter at Lucis
of the rites of the Cabeiri and Demeter Acaya
and of Orpheus, of Umapus, of Sibley.
But I like this little touch at the end,
most frequently of the rites of Dionysus.
And then look under Roman numeral number two
in the second line, orgia mouson.
Isn't that nice in the frogs?
Brekekeke, coax, coax, say the frogs, right?
As you're sitting on the throne,
exercising the deep things of Satan.
Right, these are the mysteries.
These are the mysteries
and we're about to find Aphrodite.
Isn't that nice?
Orgia, let's go to the next one, please.
Now, this is the Greek blown up.
Wrapped, you know, he wrapped that scene
on the kid, wrapped that scene on the bandage
on his privates.
Now, look at it in Mark, right?
One is secret Mark, purportedly Mark, right?
Where he's not giving away the mysteries.
Yeah, signifying with these words.
Things for those with ears to hear.
If you know what a garden is, let me just give you this.
I'm gonna speak a little Vox Orphaca.
Are you ready?
This is a language that has been trapped in Greek
for millennia.
Yeah, as a parasite.
A parasite within the blood.
Yeah, love it.
Love it.
What is a garden?
What is a garden?
It's a place where you have, you know,
maybe some soft ground with plushy growth.
Yeah, and do, tell me ancient Greek,
what else do you have in your garden?
You've got do, your capon,
you've got do in your garden.
Would you be surprised if the Greeks said that garden,
that paradise is the pudinda mulebra?
That is the garden of Edom.
Yes, what is Edom backwards?
Medwa.
Yeah, it was an Etruscan thing.
They do it the magic.
You didn't know that you may have backwards incantations.
Yeah, love it.
Fantastic, fantastic.
Buckle in for the magic.
There's a little bit more to come,
little bit more drugs, little bit more kids,
little bit more Jesus,
having become the Christos, which he admits.
Wait, you mean the title of pimp came before Jesus?
Yep, it did, right?
The fact that he is assuming the title of the molester
doesn't mean that it can't be used against him
in a court of law, trans-dimensionally speaking.
Love it, love it.
I think I got that right, all those steps, I don't know.
Sometimes I just wanna go outside and breathe some fresh air.
But I won't waste your time, let's get back to it.
Chewie, bring me up, these people are good people
who are giving me all their time.
Look, that's what the last one was
and the next one is from Mark, right?
Look at this, it uses the same expression, right?
Whoops, the one before that, there we go.
Look, it uses the same expression, people.
Yeah, peri beble meno, sindona epi gumnu.
Yeah, he's putting, this is what you could call
one of Mark's expressions.
Puttin' his penile bandage on.
Be, okay, now can you smell those boy prostitutes
from antiquity?
Can you smell them?
You know what they have in that bandage?
It has to do with their prostitution.
Okay, okay, we're getting closer to the history.
Thank you for hanging in there
and preventing any sort of prurient interest.
This is straight history, we gotta go tax people.
This is what I love about classical philology.
You can pull out the dirtiest text on the planet.
You can slap it down in front of the most straight arrow,
ox 40 and scholar and you can crack their soul.
Yeah, they'll run.
What is this word?
What is this word that means to open the garden of delight?
I want a spell to re-enter Edm.
Don't you?
I wanna go back.
What do you say?
I told the watchers we could do this.
What do you say if we storm the garden?
We know where it is.
We know where it is.
It's on the river Phosas.
It's described the location.
All of the terminology in this Bible
that you thought was Hebrew is Greek
and it is harkening back to a Bronze Age mystery cult.
Yes, yes, Moses, sit down.
I'm gonna read your book next time, right on your bottom.
Yes.
Oh, it feels good.
It feels good.
Moses' bottom is wrinkly.
Isn't that odd?
I wouldn't have thought that.
I don't know why, but now you know
why you don't fight the devil for his body.
Yeah, even Michael knew that.
If you don't know what the context is,
you don't know what the hell's going on.
And that is what classical philology brings you.
It brings you the context.
These are the texts, people.
I'm not some professor sitting here.
I'm a former professor, right?
Kind of, you know, running.
But that's the way it is.
My research is good and strong.
And we have Jesus dead to rights, people.
We have Jesus, I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, as soon as the scholars,
where are you guys?
Wake up, I know you don't wanna mess with the Bible.
I know, I know, but we have to.
It's a matter of liberty now.
You have to, you have to come in.
Your expertise is needed.
Step up, classical philologists.
Yes, step up.
Let's look at the sources.
Bring us back.
Oh, quick, I need an inject.
Yeah, right into the main line in this stuff.
Oh, look at this.
Oh, God, he fled Gomnos.
His bandage came off of his secret parts.
And he ran away.
Well, that's what, you know, you would expect, right?
That child prostitute knew exactly what to do.
Why do you think Jesus is always telling him?
This is between us and not others.
Didn't you wonder what all the grooming was for?
Give me another one.
Let's, here, people need to, time is collapsing here.
Let's get it.
Falos, I just wanted to wave falos in front of your face.
Look at Victorian, Mr. Quebec.
The membrum virile in Latin, the virile member.
Thank you very much.
Or a figure thereof, doesn't have to be the actual one.
It can be a figure.
And it is born in procession in the cult of Dionysus.
Now, that's their own opinion that follows
as an emblem of the generative power and nature.
Wait, you mean they're marching that eight foot falas
down my street for generative power?
No, I don't think it's got anything to do with that.
I'm a farmer and I got enough generative power going.
I don't need that, but I kind of want to go to this party.
Wherever that group's going, right?
A falas, I had the pleasure.
Can I just stand back and say something personal?
I don't like to do this.
I don't like to do this, but I'm gonna say something personal
in the edition of Medea
that was produced at St. Mary's University.
And translated, it was a translation by yours truly.
And it involved a procession.
My contract said it has to be accurate,
historically accurate.
I said, historically accurate, man,
do you know what you're asking me?
They didn't.
So I gave it to them.
We had a big prop that was like a six foot,
I don't know, maybe six foot, five,
maybe five to six feet.
Dildo, phallus.
That's what a phallus is from antiquity.
Ancient dildo, right?
Image, image of a male member, a male member,
ready for combat.
Yes, ready to find that garden.
Yes.
These are the rights that they are being a part of.
So you have to set yourself,
to you it may be comical.
And for those of you for whom this is prurient,
shame on you.
This is history.
Clean your act up.
Clean your act up.
Now, let's go back to the text.
Let's see what these people are doing.
I still wanna see what they're doing though.
Don't get me wrong, right?
We can tantalize ourselves with the history.
Let's bring up the next one.
They, yeah, no, not that one.
Skip that one.
Go to the next one, go to the next one.
Yeah, here we go.
I just want flash, just another text before you.
Who are these people?
Who are the people that were following with that giant,
that giant phallus?
And by the way, when I was taking the phallus,
I had the pleasure, take it down.
I forgot to end my story.
I had the divine pleasure
of being able to bring this procession
to St. Mary's University
with students carrying a giant phallus.
The impact that this had on the audience was devastating.
And the whole place as realistically as we could do
smelled of an incense that my team wasn't my team,
the university's team of prop designers and set designers,
what they were able to come up with
from a magic formula that I had delivered to them.
And the whole place when you walked into the theater
and it was sold out every night,
every night in front of me,
there was a couple of students there
having a conversation with each other.
And one of them said to the other,
we're coming back again tomorrow, right?
And I saw him again tomorrow.
It was that enthralling, that enthralling.
So it was very successful, loved it.
But it gave us the ability to point that at the people
who are involved in the child abuse
and bring them to purification, to purification.
It was a true pagan rite.
It was a true, the theater is Dionysiac is Dionysus gets.
Okay, I've gotten off track.
Bring us back, bring us back.
A text, Chewie, we're gonna get caught out here
by the imperial, you know what I mean?
Okay.
Uto agar hoy profite alfente astres planeta.
You know how these people are in this procession?
Leave it up, I'm just gonna translate the text.
They are these wandering stars.
These prophets who have turned aside from the way,
the way of his commandments and they have come to an abyss,
an abyss that is endless with the flesh
and the insomatic crime, the insomatic crime.
What's that last line say?
These people, these people,
these people, they grow in nature into gnosis.
Look at that last word, second and last word
on that line five, gnosis, that's where we're headed.
Thank you for dealing with the carpocratians.
There's some things that you cannot talk about.
Those are the things for which we invoke silence.
We invoke takita, silence, holy, reverent silence.
These people, you wanna see where they're going
and what they're doing?
I'm gonna, let's bring it up.
Next one.
Look at this, look at this.
They're entering that gnosis, which is, you know,
like they say, the deep things of,
look at that last word, people,
look at that last word, satana, satana,
satarna, satwarna in old, old, old Greek.
Oh, beautiful.
What are they doing?
They're entering into those deep things.
When you are a Christian and you have not partaken
of the opening of the garden,
you do not have ionic life.
You have not entered death and been born again.
I'm gonna say this to those of you
because I know I have a special,
I have a special sting in my voice here.
You know, when you became born again,
that you were just flipping on this mental switch.
You didn't enter into death.
You weren't raised, revived from a state of death.
You didn't enter into the communion of the cop.
You are nowhere near a mystery.
You are closer to a philosopher
than you are an initiate into a mystery.
And that is the deepest insult
I could possibly hurl at Christianity.
Your mystery is absent.
There is more of your Christian mystery
in the excitement of a priest who is raping a child
than in all of your congregations
and all of your crazy preachers and teachers, all of them.
Your mystery is a mystery of the deep things of Satan.
Give me that last one.
Boom, look at this.
We talked about frogs.
I wanted to end it with a little bit of the frogs.
This is the chorus as we are going through death
back to life.
This is the chorus.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Rise up.
See that first word?
Again, rise up.
Rise up, the chorus sings to you.
Rise up.
He has come
shaking in his hands that torch.
That torch that contains the ether of our souls.
Ether of our souls, the flocks.
Do the Greeks have complex words?
Yeah, they do.
Do you know what the ether of your soul is?
No, you don't.
I know you don't.
I've been reading this for years
and I can barely, barely get my mind conceptually
around what that is.
Just, you know, I give myself a little leeway
and just say, eh, well, you know, that's for smart people.
Okay, but when they get into the quantum physics,
you can't, it's hard to keep up.
It's hard to keep up.
I know there's those of you out there
this is not hard to keep up with.
Congratulations, you know, you get an award, right?
Smarty pants, right?
Okay, look at the chorus though.
They say, he's come, right?
And then it yake, yake, oh, yake.
Come morning star of our nocturnal initiation.
Come morning star.
Do you know who the morning star is?
The morning star is Satan.
Why is Jesus being called upon
as the great morning star, the great Satan?
It's because within the mystery,
that great Satan is the one who is Christed.
Yeah.
Yeah, if you had been there with Jesus,
wouldn't notice delegates, you know,
from the school came and they were like,
hey bro, take all this money and take your kid,
go to Egypt and get them all set up.
Yeah, he comes back.
He's more educated than anyone, right?
Do you think Judea, do you know why Jesus' parents
sent him to be educated outside of Judea?
Because Roman wealthy aristocrats
who somebody wanted to punish
would get assigned Judea.
Yeah, what they called Palestine.
Yeah, it's that bad.
Do you think they have an educational system there?
No, they don't have a, they're just catching up with Greek.
You notice there's not really literature
until they get the Greek in their hands.
Yeah, yeah, that's how it is, people.
I keep trying to explain this to people.
I wanna say it really quick
because I'm free to say this.
Not all languages are created equal.
Yeah, some survive and flourish, some die.
Some, and it's a smaller percentage,
reach a level of literary fruition.
Yeah, very few reach that point.
Most of the languages of humanity have died
because that's what languages do, they die.
Yeah, and depending on the time,
they're spoken, you'll see the level of complexity
and technical expertise rise, rise, rise, rise, rise.
It's why Greek can express integrals and calculus.
Do you mean the Greek language?
The ancient Greek language, yes, yes.
No insult to the modern Greeks,
but you know as well as I do
that your language is a simplification.
Yeah, yeah, has to be brought down.
See all of our levels, right?
That's what classical philology is.
It's trying to grasp that great wisdom
that is locked in that powerful language.
Yeah, it's gorgeous, it's nature.
Nature, definitely.
And the poor Romans like,
why is there an English note, it's nice.
Yeah.
Last quote, I wanted to finish off the frogs
and let people go, they need to get to their thing.
I just want you to know that bottom line,
phosphorus, austere, that is Lucifer.
Within the position of the cult,
the devil, Satan, Hades,
and yes, Amon, that Dionysiac position
of the leader, the source, the dragon
who guards the Korah.
Cause you know, people are surprised,
but no, it turns out hell's all about the queen.
Yeah.
And that's why you don't argue for the body of Moses.
You got no power.
You can't beat physics.
The world is topsy-turvy.
The North Pole is the South Pole.
Jesus was running prostitution of boys
using drugs that will alter your state of consciousness
and awareness and perception.
Thank you to Clement.
Thank you to Clement for the ride, appreciate it.
Tomorrow, Friday, coming up,
I'm going to have just a 45 minute discourse
after the Satanic initiation, right?
And what we'll do is I'm going to run it
like I used to run it at the university
when I gave symposia, right?
Where we had professors of all different disciplines
together with students, seminarians,
and we throw out a topic and we discuss that topic.
That's what I would like to turn our time into,
and I'm going to do that this Friday,
20 minutes after we end Satanic initiation.
So let's see if that works.
And everybody's invited, I'll post a link.
The more brains, the better.
I love it, but we'll talk about topics
that I will throw out and I will not give
soliloquies or long explanations.
This is a time for discussion.
So we'll throw out some topics like the boys
and the prostitution or anything
that you guys want to talk about.
There's drugs, some people like to talk
about the drugs and antiquity.
That's a good area too.
So fantastic, thank you for coming tonight.
I just want to say, keep in mind that the actual history
is there and all we have to do is assemble those
sources.
We have to become familiar.
We have to love that medium that it's all in
and that medium is the Greek.
That medium is the Greek.
And you guys, oh, bless, it's a bless.
What a garden, what a garden, so much do.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Hail Satan.
Fair down the fences that fence us all in.
Fences created by such evil men that we could.
Fair down the fences that fence us all in.
Maybe we could walk together again.
Just maybe we could walk together again.
