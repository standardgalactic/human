This is it.
Medea and the snake charmers
Dragon venom think of vipers
Make you hemorrhage blood, hemlock whoops bang
Lavender moon rise, they're out of the game
Electrical blood, bind you with wonderful drugs
Raw opium drips, hail Satan in the dark harbor
Open your eyes, give you vision
Go to the serpent temple
And take some dragon venom
The power of the black mirror
I'm with the root cutters, the darn bringers
Medea the sorceress, Venus producer of the sweetest nectars
Dance with the muse, the radio specter
The muse sings of me
Whisper left face
Hold my heart so dear
Dancing in a dream
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
This is Initiating Apocalypse
I have some great news for you
And I have a couple of things to talk about
Our talk today is going to be two different things
I'm going to introduce you to the Canitis
And then we are going to look at a couple of
I'm sorry
We're going to look at a couple of, this is serious
A couple of passages there right out of Genesis
Just to show you how this cannot be a translation
From Hebrew to Greek
The Greek is the original
Yeah, it's gorgeousness and gorgeousity is what it is
So that's fantastic
We'll get to that second half
First half I want to bring you
And I want to make this a solemn moment
I do
Before we get to the Canitis
I want us to be able
To be able to really push into that dirt
To get down there and to get that evidence right in our hands
I just want to look at it
I want to look at it

Okay
Here we go, bring it up
Take a look at the stats really quick
You know what I mean
Just take a look at the stats
This is the total number of words
Total number of words
Of different languages from antiquity
You notice the Egyptian total number
5 million, that's not bad
That's not bad
Look at the
Down a little bit, lowered Latin
Got about 10 million
This is up to 380
So
That's not bad
That's a decent amount
Tell me something
What's the Acadian at
Everybody's trying to just ram a Cadian
9 million
Sumerian
Here, shout out to Gilgamesh
In that third grade reading
Level epic
You know me people
You know I'm going to call a spade
A spade
Okay, now I want you to look
At Greek
Look at Greek
57 million
57 million
You can take it down
67 million
Do you know what that chart says
You say it says a lot
It's got a whole bunch of numbers
And bleep bleep
Cue this and pie that
That chart
Says
Greek
Is a potent lady
She is a potent lady
She is going to take you somewhere
That you cannot go with
A million and a half
Unique word forms
Your average third graders
Got a vocabulary
You know the Gilgamesh reader
Has a vocabulary of about
3,000 words
You know what I mean
Oh God
Maybe 4,000, 5,000
Oh my God
That is about all of the ancient Hebrew
Wait a minute
You mean the technical level
Of the ancient Hebrew that we've got
Is about the level of the third grader
Yeah, it is
It is
It's a sad reality
And I'll show you in a minute
But languages are not all created equal
Yeah
And
Oh God, did Greek take over
Oh God
So much
So much why
What is the superiority
People keep asking me
What is the superiority of Greek
Ancient Greek
What is the power
It's the power to transform
It's the power to take
What is in the mind
And to bring it down
To pull it down to a concept
Where's the conitus
Where's the conitus
Bring on the conitus
Oh
Open the doors for the conitus
What is going on on that pot
That looks
Is that who I think it is

Boom
Here we go
People right out of the Victorian flatus
Are you ready
Catamite
That's what a quinaidos is
It's a catamite
Did you see what the Victorians did
They took you off into Latin
So that only educated would get it
That's not nice of them
It's generally a lewd fellow
There's a lot of range
Does anybody use that kind of
My neighbor is a lewd fellow
Public dancer
Oh my God
Well, this is getting better
Because in the plural
It's used just for obscene poetry

Etymology
Look at here
What is this from
What does this catamite mean
I told you
They were fooling you
Right
Using Latin on you
So you wouldn't recognize it
Well, catamite
It's really from the Etruscan
And that Etruscan, believe it or not
Is written backwards
Right
Because it's supposed to be
Right to the left
But anyway, catamite
From ancient Greek
Ganumides
Ganumides
Do you hear the maid root
In the medua

You're going to start smelling

Look
Catamitus
Here it is in Latin
A boy or a younger man
In a homoerotic
Homoerotic
In a homoerotic relationship
Remember they don't have a word
For homosexual
Right
So if you just left that out
In a sexual relationship
You'd be just fine
You'd be just fine

That's what they're describing
Okay
Okay

Right technically
Let's go to the next one
Boom
What is it not a notice
Well it is this canidos
So here look what I'm doing people
I'm bringing you from the grave
I'm bringing you the person who is defining it
And ultimately remember this ends up from
Going from Ezekius to his
The real source of this dictionary
Which is an Alexandrian
Gramarian
And he says the canidas is the nan naris
Nan naris
And wow
How do I know
You know I'm an attic
Great dude walking around
How do I know
Nan naris
I don't recognize that
Give me the next one
Don't worry
We can figure it out
Nan nadzon
Nan nadzon
Oh right it's using the same root
Which is probably Pulascian
And what does it mean
It means to pyzomenon
And you'll recognize
My Greek students will recognize the root
For the child in their pice
Is the root for child
What is
What do you do when you pyzomenon
Well if you ask the Victorians
They'll say you play sportively
To engage in youthful amorous play
Youthful amorous play
That is what the canidas does
Jesus Christ was arrested
With a slave
Who was a boy
And who was naked
He was assigned to Jesus
What is the sasa pygis
What is it that these boys are characterized by doing
What is it
I know it's rough material people
It's rough but it's history
You can turn away if you want to
Let's go

Oh goodness we're back
Look at that
That creepy Jesus got us knocked out of the
Asteroid belt
Okay give me the

Boom
Where was it on the list
There it is
Okay so I want to look at
Who is the yonks
Remember it's the bird
It's the bird
You stay with me
And what is this yonks
This yonks is also called sasa pygis
That is the quaking of the buttocks
Yeah and why is this
It's because by the way
Who am I reading to you
Who am I translating for you
This is the skoliast
On theocratist's ittle number two
So this is one ancient Greek
Talking about another famous
Ancient Greeks work
Okay skoliast
They're commenting on the work
And this commenter here says
What is the yonks
Because in theocratist's second ittle
Which is about the witches
And the sorcery
He mentions the bird
The bird is central
Right what is the bird here
The bird is known to turn around
And shake its booty
They call her yunga
Callimachus told her about her
She's the daughter of echo
Wait what
She's the daughter of echo
And what does she do
Well we know what was done to her
Zeus drugged her
God drugged her
Why so he might sleep with her
When Hera found out
She turned her into a bird
Why so that she could work
Power of witchcraft
Power of the drugs
Isn't that gorgeous
Isn't that gorgeous
What do we have there
Oh let's keep going
Let's keep going
Give me the next one
What do we have there
We got pigae
Which is your rump
Right I want you people to see this
But
But
It's also
Look at number two at the bottom
Right and by the way
This is the standard word for buttocks
In ancient Greek
How do we define the buttocks
We define the buttocks
By staring at aphrodites
Isn't that interesting
What do they call aphrodite
They call her calipigenus
That's her epithet
She of the beautiful buttocks
She of the beautiful buttocks
How do you define
That's not the
Listen we got to turn it around
Come on she
We got to falcon on the wrong side
She of the beautiful buttocks
That's how
Let's go back to the buttocks
Because at the bottom of the buttocks
You're going to find something
Look here
And the number
Revenue number two
Ura
Ura
Right so we're at the buttocks
And if you just move down a little bit
You're going to see the ura
What is the ura
Take it down
I'm going to tell you what the ura is
The ura is what Satan used
To draw down a third of the angelic powers
Now for those of you who are sitting
On the throne of Satan
Hail Satan
For those of you who are sitting
On the throne of Satan
Do you understand
Yeah
For those with ears to hear
For those with ears to hear
That's what the ura is
Now how is the ura translated
Go to the next slide
Kick it
Kick it Chewie
Boom
What is that ura
It's the tail right
It's right there at the bottom of the pig
And it's the tail
It's the tail
You got that thing
Hanging off the bottom there
And uh oh
What else
You know
Yeah
I just got to say
Go ahead and leave it up
The God who left the ewa
With the best looking being
And a tree full of drugs
That God wasn't thinking
I don't know
There's bad planning
Okay Yahoo
If there's one thing I can say
Bad planning
What is the ura
That Lucifer is so well known
That Serpent is so well known for using
Look at number two
Eidoyun
Eidoyun
Do you mean his tail is his Eidoyun
Yes
Some of us listening tonight
Have an Eidoyun
Or Eidoya
Many of us have Eidoya
Yes
Those are our tails
By which we
Who are the most beautiful
Command of the universe
Who's kingdom is this
Who's kingdom is this
Says Jesus
Jesus tell me
Tell me Jesus
Who's kingdom is this
It's kingdom of the devil
Isn't that nice
That's the ura
Do you understand it
Go to the next one
Go to the next one
Quick hit him with this
Before they wake up
Watch
Here we go
This is part of the commentary
I just want to pull out this
Scoliasis and say
Look
We get a really good explanation
Of Priapus here
Right
Priapus is that child of Dionysus
And the Nymphniad Keene
Right
You know
He's associated with Lamsicus
You know
And some people say
With Dionysus himself
And they prove this
I'm translating
From the etymology
Look at it
Oh God
Look at this
Third line down
The fourth word in etymology
Yes
That's the word for etymology
Oh God
Oh it's so good
It's so good
It's the good that says
Don't show it from the waist down
Fantastic
Priapus
Now
Why are we concerned about Priapus
And the etymology of his name
Just hang in there
Let's see
It's all wrapped up together nicely
Connected beautifully
In this beautiful tapestry of history
Written history
Oh here we go
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Because I want to explain
What the Scoliasis says
And this is theochris
Theochris is a Hellenistic poet
By the way people
Right
Like the Hellenistic poet
Yeah
Theochris
Itals
Talking about magic
Talking about bringing back your lover
You want to call back your lover
Here we go
What
One before this Chewie
One before us
We've got one star system ahead
There we go
And look
What does he say here
About the etymology
Right
It actually is not Priapus
He says
It's Priapus
Sticks the diagram
And that
Upsilon in there
And what is this for?
This is because they're referencing
He says
The Bacchic dance of intoxication
That involves all the shouting
The shouting
Right
The shouting
And he's arguing that etymologically
From this next star system
Go to the next one
Boom
Look here
Apio
Apio
Are you ready?
What does it mean?
It means some kind of roaring
Some kind of vocalization
Right
In the middle
It can be
To summon
Right
Ooh, I like that
I like that so much
It's that voice
That magic voice that calls
Can you hear it?
I love it
Go back to the
One more time with the text above that
Now people
What does he say at the very bottom?
He says in Priapus
Some people say Priapus
Comes from
Uh-oh
When I said Sperma
You probably got it
What is it to project the sperm?
To project the Sperma
When you
Does everybody see what that moment is
Of that rush
That
Bruh
That shouting
That vocalization
That brings the forecast
The throwing out
The injection into the world
Of that Sperma
Because we all know
We all know
That the universe
Is born from seed
The universe is born from seed
We are farmers
Our universe is cultivation
You know where religion comes from?
Some people have been saying
Comes from the drugs
No, the drugs are a part of it
But it doesn't come from the drugs
It comes from the nature
Yeah
It comes from nature herself
Oh, wow
Wow
Imagine understanding the world
From that perspective
Okay, here we go
That's Priapus
And that's why he's necessary
Keep going
Next one
Oh, bam
We're gonna get through these fast tonight people
There's a couple of
Before we get here, by the way
Everybody, since we're here
And you see the Canatus
Sitting in front of you
Right?
You see the Canatus
You saw him
I usually don't refer to the
You know, to our thumbnail
But tonight
We're looking right in the face of that boy
Who was with Jesus Christ
And he was arrested in a public park
And the kid was naked
He was naked at the time
Right?
With just this bandage on his private parts
What's happening Jesus?
Jesus is screaming
I'm not a trafficker
Yeah
Where are those boys?
Where are those boys?
There's three of them right there
Right?
Which one of them did he give the
Up into?
It was the old one
Yeah
That older teenage guy
What was his name?
Peter
I think it was
Yep, let's keep going
They called him the rock
Right?
The enforcer
How do we get here?
We got here from the Filtra
Right?
What are the Filtra?
There's those
Pharmaca
Those drugs people
That lead us to Philean
They literally cause us
To passionately crave Philea
Do you know what I mean?
I'll give you something
And when I give you that substance
You will be pushed
How do they translate Philea?
It can be kisses
It can be kisses
It can be kisses or it can be
Hardcore intercourse
Yeah
That state of love
Isn't that nice?
These kisses can be brought to you
By the drugs
So we're sitting here
In antiquity, right?
Put it down
Put it down
Put it down
Whatever it is
Dinner
Put it down
We're sitting here in the park
And we're with the Canatus
The one that was with Jesus
When he was arrested
He's got the bandage on
His private parts
And what is he doing?
He's getting drugs
He's getting drugs
To make him
Sexually aroused
You mean they're drugging people?
I just gave you two direct examples
One with Zeus
And one
With Jesus
And what do we do?
We turn the kid into a cup
The cup bear is the one
Who has that glane
And we're going to push
The poison through the glane
We get a combo
And that combo will keep you alive
Okay
All right
You wanted to see it
We got more on the Canatus here
Keep going to the next one
Was that Hermes?
I had to summon him
Look at his people
What are the pharmacos we're talking about?
In this particular commentary
He's saying hey
Or you know
Scolias's work is not really a commentary
It's just like a helpful way
Of explaining the poetry
Like the poetry is being studied
So in the Selenian mountain
What happens?
There are these people there
And they have
These instruments that belong to
Medea and to Cersei
And they're things that they use
To prepare drugs
They're used to prepare drugs
For those of you who thought
Medea was myth
These are people talking about
The reference to the instruments
That they're using in their drug
Making crafts
Their toxicological work
Right
They've got them
They've got those instruments
Keep going
Beautiful
Next one
Remember the Neoniscos
That's with Jesus
I'm going to give you
Just a little bit of whiff of that boy
I want you to come close
To the kid
The kid that was naked
With the bandage on his private parts
I want you to come close to him
From the throne
I want you to reach out
And I want you to say
What is this historically?
Young man, young man
What is this thing?
Now, you know
What is he according to Ezekius?
He's a napios
He's a napios
Seriously?
That makes me feel bad for him
You know what he just said?
He said he's an idiot
He's somebody who can be mentally controlled
Like a young boy
Oh, you mean I shouldn't have called him a young man?
No, because he's not a young man
He's a boy
He's with a napios
He's with somebody who is not mentally finished
Haven't cooked yet
Give me the next one
What is this?
What is napio?
Just for those of you
Because I get people telling me
Hey, no, this kid
He's 30
He's got a beard
And he's got a wife and kids
No, no, napia
Or micropaedia
Those are tiny kids
Those are tiny kids who cannot yet understand
How to defend themselves
If you give those kids drugs
As a lace-dace
You can sexually
Mold them into prostitutes
Conveyors of a religious form of communion
Known as the mystery
Are you kidding me?
Is that what Jesus was doing with the boy?
Is that what Jesus was doing with the boy?
Now, everybody who says,
Neoniskos is a 30-year-old
Right?
Now, look at how they're defining the words
All you do, you seminarians, you Bible historians
All you scholars of things having to do
With the Dead Sea Scrolls
All of that religious garbage
Doesn't use the evidence
It doesn't look at the evidence
It has no reality to it
No underground
It's built on sand
It's built on pure sand
I love this stuff
Where's the lace-dace?
Do you want to know what the lace-dace is?
Let's show you one
Let's show you Alexander
Because people have been asking me
Lace-dace, lace-dace
Alexander the False Prophet is one
And what does he do?
He orders his boys according to their looks
They got to be tall
They can't have pimples
Have a clear compulsion
They got to be the cream of the crop, he says
Yes, okay
And what can you do with your boys?
You can drug them
You can drug them?
Yes
They're little factories, people
It's ancient pharmacology
Where did that gigantic...
Where did that gigantic...
I was waving this around
It's one of my copies of Galen
Today, I was looking at it
It's volume 12
Oh, it's right here, Chewie
It's volume 12
Take a look at this, people
People, take a look at this
This is volume 12 from 1826
And what is it?
It's one of the pharmaceutical volumes
You mean that is all an ancient Greek dude
Riding about drugs
All of that
All, every page
Every page
Oh, my God
Wow
The sophistication here
You got to have respect for it
You really got to have respect for it
Get us back up
What is that?
The converter?
All right, it's plugged in
Fantastic
Go to the next one
Let's keep... come on
We got to keep people in that zone
For those of you who missed the Bible
I just wanted to throw in Micah
Come here, Micah
Come here, Micah, the prophet
This is made up in the third century
But here we go
What happens?
God is going to destroy utterly the drugs
Your drugs, not just the drugs
Your drugs
He's going to destroy them right out of your hands
You greedy drug thugs
And what?
And all of those elevated thoughts
That you get from them
What?
What?
Yes
Yes, Yahoo's back at the party
Right, Yahoo's back at the party
He told the devil he was like
Watch the drugs
Watch them
Yeah, what do you think the devil did?
She was...
You don't understand
You just don't understand
That's the problem
That's the real difference between the devil and Yahoo
Jehovah Hashem
That's the big difference between Hashem and Satan
Yeah
It always comes down to Aphrodite
It always comes down to Aphrodite
Who do you think it is that gives you all the generation?
Why do you think that Romans walked around so proud
To be the children of Aphrodite?
Oh, God
Okay, you're almost there
If you're that much closer to the mystery name of power
That is Roma
If you've captured that name yet
You just got a whiff of it right there
Do you feel it?
You just got a whiff of it
The medwa is the awa
Is the awa
And you set her up with the ademas
And in their presence
You brought him
You brought the best looking men
With a whole bunch of sex drugs
And you didn't think they would end up naked
You pervert
Oh, my God
Your religion is built upon an orgy
Now it was fabricated in the third century
Fabricated in the third century
Let's go
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
We're getting into it
I want to give you some verses
Look, we're going to end on this
We're going to end on this
Tonight, I'm going to bring you back to creation
What is written below is the Greek
It says in the beginning
God made Uranos and Gaia
Uranos and Gaia
And Gaia was Aoratos
And Akataskeostos
Now, I'm just going to show you
This is the passage that says
The earth was Aoratos
I'm going to show you how this is
A more technically advanced work
Than what the Hebrew is
This cannot be a translation of Hebrew
You cannot take a non-technical term
And jazz it up or translate it
Into a technical term
You can't do that
You can go the other way
You can lose tech
You can't gain it
That's how Mother Nature works, baby
That's the way up
Let's go to the Tower of Babel
Are you ready?
So the earth is Aoratos
Let's see, what is the earth?
It's Aoratos
Give me the next slide
What is Aoratos?
Please, I don't mean to be a whole yelly
Here it is
I just wanted you to see it
Aoratos, see the last word
I just blew it up, right?
Aoratos
Can you see it?
Everybody in Greek should be wondering
What is Aoratos?
It is unseen or invisible
And you can see this is just Horao
The Greek verb to see
Plus the alpha-privilege
Ah, that's not true
It doesn't take much to figure that out
It's the unseen or the invisible
Notice they say
Aoratos is the unseen world
Now look what the Greek is doing
It's taking a concept
And it's taking it out of the abstract
Adjective form
The description
And it's turning it into the concrete
It's making it a noun
And Greek is exceptionally good at doing this
And as a result
The unseen becomes that
Which is unseen
The unseen world
Do you know what the unseen world is?
Do you know what the unseen world is?
No, of course you don't, right?
Because this author
Who is writing the Torah
Is faking it
They are creating something
Not passing down documents
They are creating
It is a Greek creation
Oh, are you kidding?
Do you know how much that changes history?
Oh my God
It's no wonder
Israel and Tel Aviv, Finkelstein
It's no wonder
You were there
We found that Canaanite Temple
At the bottom of Megiddo
You know that thing they call
Solomon's blank fortress
You know it's not that
There's no archaeological evidence
This is a forged history
It's a forged history
Fantastic, right?
Now, presumably
They want you to thank scribes
And scholars
And Sadducees
And sectists
And zealots
People in deserts
With pots
And the end is coming
That kind of people, right?
The people with the knowledge
Of the box
The monist box
Because what monism does
And Akhenaten taught us this
And I'm Amon
Hail Satan
Akhenaten
Is the one who's bringing
First brought that monist box
Everybody in the box
Anybody outside the box
Is killed
That's all there is to it
It's the form of genocide
That makes the basis
Of the volcano of monist religions
It's that magma
It's ultimately going to blow
Yes, fantastic
Not so fantastic
Right, that's how much is it
Not so fantastic
The watchers, thank you
Suck, by the way
Go to the next one
Look at this
What do they make of the
That which is unseen
What do they do with the unseen world?
Right?
The translators
Who are trying to create a Hebrew text
From the Greek Septuagint
It's very complex
Formless confusion
Unreality, maybe emptiness
Doesn't it sound like a shotgun?
Sounds like a shotgun, bro
Did you hit that
The linguists that are working on this
Did you guys hit that with a shotgun?
Were you like, oh, I don't know
But here, this is bound to hit something
It's from an unused word
What the?
I dare you to find
I dare you to find any classical philologist
Whatever, say this
From an unused word
It sounds like your Hebrew
Your ancient Hebrew is a forgery
It sounds like you're making it up
From the Greek
Did you know there are words in Greek
That are way older
The Hebrew adapts to its own
In the Septuagint
It makes, it creates roots
It's a forgery
The Torah, the Old Testament
The Pentateuch
The Books of Moses
A forgery
A forgery
Wow
Wow, why would you do such a thing?
Why would you forge something like that?
It's appropriation, it's to claim legitimacy
Right?
It's that fight, that eternal fight
Between us and what is foreign
Yeah
It happens over and over again
In history and ultimately it ends up
In a genocidal rainstorm
Yeah, it's amazing
Amazing
Monism is dangerous
It's the most dangerous quantum chemical
In existence
And in reflection
Yeah, it's that reflection poison
Let's go, let's go to the next one
What is akata?
So you can see that the Hebrew
Is not able to approximate
What is akata skewastos?
Now look at this word
You can just look at this
What else is the world in creation?
It's akata skewastos
Now you can see from this Greek
That this is not a short little word
This thing is built
Not only does this thing have a root
But it's also got a prefix
And an alpha-private
Okay, now watch how the meaning changes
What is this thing?
Akata skewastos
What is an earth that is that?
We'll start with skewastos
That means something prepared by art
Right, it's artificial
As opposed to futeltos
And what is futeltos?
That is something that has fuo
That has nature
That's been engendered
That's been engendered
And this word skewastos
Is used of drugs
Right, why?
Because drugs are prepared
They're artificial constructions
When they're talking pharmacos
They're not talking plants
Now they're talking all of the plant substances
That we're combining and treating with this
And with this wash
And we do this six months later
It turns out you take this stuff
And it turns you into frankenstein
Right, okay
What is this thing here?
Look, it's a drug
But look at gala in there at the bottom
It also uses sumi amata
What are sumi amata?
Those are things that you inhale
And there's a, you know, pre-stess
And she's singing
And she's burning some stuff
And after a while, you fly in with the group
Welcome
Welcome to Bacchic air
Please put your seats in their fully back position
With your feet up in the air
Yes, fantastic
Fantastic, brought to you by the virgin
Oh, is this that virgin?
This is the dark one
This is the dark one
This is the Malinnoi
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
Malinnoi
That dark mind
Hmm, beautiful
You knew if I was going to talk about the magic of the catamites
You knew that I would have to bring her in
Right, she's the queen
Let's go to the next one
Hmm, so what happens with that scewo stos
When I add kanta to it, watch the Greek form real concepts
Artificial as opposed to autofuis
Self-generated, right?
Under artificial conditions
And then suborned when you talk about people
Being suborned
Oh, God
Now, let's add an alpha privative to the front of it
Watch how it changes the meaning
What is this thing?
Out of the Bible
Akata scewo stos
Not properly prepared
In the first example, there was a pharmacon
Right?
Unformed
Unwrought
Unpolished
Now, give me the next one, please
Give me the next one
What is the...
Hesekius, what do you think of Akata scewo stos?
You think it's afilokalaton
Afilokalaton
Look at that beautiful long word
It's kale plus filo plus ah
On the front of it, what does it mean?
What does it mean? I'm chasing these words
I think I'm ecstatic or something
Because they seem to all be connected
Afilokalatos means without adornment
Without adornment
Okay
How is it going to be translated into Hebrew?
This term
Are you ready?
Here we go
Emptiness
Now, you can hear it
You can hear it
If I just explained everything I explained to you
To a third grader
They would say
Emptiness
Yes
Yes, do you see
What the Hebrew scholars were doing?
Hebrew was so dead
That they only had 8,000 words to work with
And the best that you can do is come up with something
That sounds like the epic of Gilgamesh
It's just a fact of nature
Mother Greek is a monstrous
She's a monstrous
Let's keep going
Watch this, I'm going to do it with another verse
Are you ready?
And the darkness was all over the
Abusu
All over the what?
Abusu
What is an Abusu?
Give me the next one
It is a perazukhekon
Something that has no peraz
No boundary
It is an infinite
It has no stops to it
The Abyss has no
Give me the next one
How are we going to define it with the Victorians?
It's bottomless, unfathomed
And they talk about Pagai
Springs
Unfathomable, boundless
Right, boundless
Now look at definition number 2
What is it when you take this word
And Greek does this
This is again the power of the language
Now that adjective bottomless
Unfathomed
Which by the way puts the
What is unfathom?
That's the mind of Zeus
Nice, the thoughts anyway
The council
What is it?
It's the great deep
It's the underworld
It's the infinite
Wait, no, leave that one out
What is it when it says the great deep here
That's from the Septuagint
And underneath that
Is the Gospel of Luke
The Epistle to the Romans
And the Apocalypse
Wait a minute, I think we have a Victorian
I think we have a Victorian who's messing with us
Do you see what happens?
We're trying to define
A word based upon its neighborhood
And its neighborhood is a select text
Group of text, the New Testament and the Septuagint
And that's it
They're trying to create a special
Divergent definition
And this is a no-no
This is a no-no
Let's keep going
Go to the next one
Watch this people
Boom, what do we do with it?
Third grade man
Raka
An extended surface or an expanse
A surface or an expanse
Do you see how basic that is?
A surface or an expanse
Okay, so my tech is dropping
I'm losing my tech
Give me one more example
I'm going to show you this one more time
Now you'll be able to predict it yourself
Or was that the one more? Did we skip one?
Yeah, here's the
Now, the Stena Oma
Everybody's heard this translated
It's a firmament
Firmament, right?
Okay, I didn't include this
The firmament
What is that firmament?
Well, let's see what the Stena Oma is
Blow that up for me, please
It's a solid body
And you'll notice right after it
They quote annexagoras
Okay, uh-oh
Now you're talking about some pretty complex
Cosmology
Right, okay, fine
Immaterial solids
Foundation or framework
For example, it's the skeleton
On which the body is, as it were, built
It is that solid foundation
Now look at number three
This will throw you
What is this?
It's also the Stata
Now, the person here argues
It's the one that the Stata
That has to do with the ship
The Stata that has to do with the ship
But watch this
Next one
Boom
What is the Stata?
That's the one that they say
No, you can't have anything to do with that
That has not brought forth
No children, no makings
Wait, what, a heifer?
Yup
Can also just be a woman who is barren
Who has not produced
Now notice right in the smack dab
Middle of this is the Orphic Lithica
I've got a student shout out to Ion
Who's reading the Orphic Lithica right now
Okay, be careful, you've got Orphic Vox
Going on, right?
Right, look at this
Look at the bottom of that paragraph
That's number two, Roman numeral number two
It says Fusus and Psyche
Right?
Do you see what's happening?
The Virgin
The Virgin steps forward
The Virgin steps forward
Now, wait a minute
Before we go, give me the picture of that Virgin
Back again, whoever
Whoever you had programmed in for
Fantastic
So
You mean the Virgin
Is she
Who separates the waters
Yup
And if you and I are on Cyprus
We know
Who that is
She comes right out of those waters
She's the one who has the seed
And perpetuates everything
Yeah
That Priapus
That is the spirit
Of the Leistice
Who overcomes the Canidus
Because the reason the Canidus is so important
And why Jesus has one is
You have to have that poison
Along with that
Canidus' ejaculate
You have to have its Priapus
Right?
You have to have that force
Or it won't work
Physiologically, it won't work
And it's dangerous
Because what they're painting
That scene done with
It's wrapped around that kid's private parts
That's a poison
It will kill you
It's all those witches, man
It's all those witches
You see that thing sitting there?
Sitting there?
That thing is described in the Aristophanes
And he compares it to a penis
Yeah
And it's a joke between a wife and her husband
She wants to give him some
Yeah
And he's like, nope
Interesting
Let's go back
Remember we're in Cyprus
So what happens?
Go back to the last one
We're in Cyprus
So ladies, guess what
This weekend
You get to go out
And celebrate Adonis
With a total stranger
That you pick out
And Mr. Husband
That you have at home
He's not going to say a single thing
Do you know why?
We have kicked around
We ladies of city
Have kicked this place around so much
We have real power
We have real power
Isn't that nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
Let me just ask this
Before we finish
We're talking about the Canidis all night
We have to
Because that Canidis is with Jesus
And it's terms like Canidis
That we can't
We're not going to be able to translate
Into the Hebrew
It's not going to be able to make it to that level
Okay, I'm sorry
It's okay
You're dealing with a language
It's got 1.5 million
And you can't
8,000
Eat your cupcake, Tommy
You know what I mean?
It's okay
Daddy will be home soon
It's getting late
It's already 8 o'clock
Go to bed
Go to bed, right?
Me and me and Greg
We're going to stay up tonight
Me and Greg
Alright
Now, could you feel it?
Go to that very last one
Give me that last last slide
We'll end on this, people
Just some a little bit of
Serious gift
Look at this
Semelos
What is Semelos?
Some of you will recognize the name
Semeli
This is Hasekius again
Thank you, Hasekius
For your definitions
This is Semeli
Who is Semeli?
Semeli is the mother of Dionysus
Alright, Hail Satan
The mother of Dionysus
And what does Hasekius tell us?
The great name of the virgin
Remember who she is, Semeli
I'll just remind you
She's the virgin who slept with Zeus
Who slept with God
Do you know her?
Do you know a virgin who slept with God?
Is that something?
And we're just here to prove
That that happened
Look at the name
Look at the name
What's under the name of Semeli?
What's under the same root?
It's using the same root
Kochlias
Kochlias
That's the purple people
That's the purple, you know, in Euripides
In the opening lines of the Bacchai
Says that he was birthed in the lightning
He had that oistress
He got that oistress from Semeli
From Semeli, the child
Dionysus is the child of she
Who founded the Bacchic Rite
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that gorgeous?
Welcome to the Bacchic Empire
Welcome
It's time to go
And that really gets my goat
Because I wanted to tell everybody
Everybody
Anybody who's kept a...
Stop
I mean, keep it
Just wait
With all due reverence
Penelope
Show us the cross
Give us the cross to behold
Let us know that its power emanates
From what it covers
And it covers a multitude of sin
A multitude
Thank you, Penelope
Rock on
Thank you for coming tonight
Everybody, you can see that I'm still not giving you
a chance for arm and you
It's still under construction, man
It's under construction
It's coming
But it will be something fantastic
And I appreciate everybody
Who's interested
Everybody, right?
Anyone who wants to enlist
I appreciate
Thank you
Yeah, there's this...
There's this...
Yeah, there is
There is
Hail Satan, Rob Street
The stain
Yes
Do we have a song about an immortal stain?
I think we need one
Thank you, everyone who is waiting, though
Seriously, and I will be pushing that forward
Please keep a lookout for Danny Jones
Who totally rocks
And, okay
I think it was gorgeous
Absolutely gorgeous to be able to sit with him
So, I appreciate that
Thank you for coming tonight
And you know what it's time for
It's time to Hail Satan
I'm on the wheel on the room
When she walks in
I'm on the harp and the bongo drums
Like the magic gin
In the morning
I blaze weed
Get behind the mule and push
Someone's gotta grow this sage
And frankincense
So they can get high
Cornucopia from the garden orchard
Bobo rigatoni
Sipping wine
At the Barca Lades
Have a little taste
High off the contact
Sounds nice
But perfume is the intoxication
The mule sings to me
Whisper little things
Hold my heart so deep
Dancing in a dream
