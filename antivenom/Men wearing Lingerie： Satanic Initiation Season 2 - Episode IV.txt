Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met, I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that whore called Destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
What we've got on the plate for you tonight is a little bit odd
It's going to be off track
In order to keep you necromancers alive
We're going to be drawing up a spirit
But only near the end of our time
Although he is a lovely
Otherwise tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to depart
And we're going to talk about me
A little bio to answer your questions
And I cannot think of something that makes me more uncomfortable than this
So, because who wants to talk about themselves?
Right? Hit it
Before we get to the bio
I want to also mention that tomorrow at 10 a.m.
We will be having our first intensive Greek necromancy class
We're having it in the morning early on Saturdays
In order to accommodate people's time
10 o'clock mountain who are living across the pond
So hopefully our British contingent will be able to
Come and partake of the offerings
Which I'll talk about a little bit more in a minute
But somebody asked me today
Who are you?
They wanted to know because they're looking at a potential future in the area
They want to know who I am
And where I teach
Let me show you
I've made a little video
It's just a short video
But it encompasses some of the headlines
And a couple of images
And some nice music from Zane Campbell
Thank you very much Zane
And Chewie, roll it
I was lost in an airport
I walked outside onto a golf course
And somewhere on the green
I woke up from the dream
I had flown in from somewhere
I didn't know where I was going
Dreams are kind of like a life sometimes
They don't make sense at all
I was dreaming about an old love
You were lucky I left you
I would have made you miserable
Though it broke your heart and mind
I blew in from somewhere
Don't scattered your life around
I made it a nightmare
But you woke up and I was gone
So, one of my favorite headlines was
Fired for a phallus
Yes, the stage prop that was being used
In our Bacchic performance of the Medea
It was part of the sacking
That the association for university professors
The American Association, the AAUP
Descended on the university and said
Not so fast, you have done wrong
And you have taken a man out
When other professors approached me and said
You're going to be fired
I had no reason to doubt them
But I pressed ahead
I pressed ahead with bringing them that Medea
Can we see the Medea again?
Do we have her image?
Yes, this is actually one of my students
And she was the inspiration of the play
And after my sacking
Which, as you know, behind the scenes
Involved an official inquiry by the Catholic church
Into my state of demon possession
And whether or not I was opening oracles
Portals
Yeah, through oracles
Yeah, fantastic
So, that's where I'm coming from
And it was my honor and duty to the muse
To be able to serve in that capacity
To be able to take students
We had great success with our programs
With people who enter classics
Just because of the work that I was doing
And all I was doing was showing these texts
Was opening up this avenue to these texts
And so what happens to a person
After they are fired from a university
They end up in a very tricky situation
That brought me ultimately to the base
Of the largest constantly occupied
The oldest constantly occupied city on the planet
Excuse me
On our continent
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Anyway, it's a necromanic center of village
And that's how I came to this desert
I landed here after my termination from the university
I landed here
Much to the chagrin of my students
And there's a whole...
You can see from the headlines
It landed our university in the top ten bad universities
For free speech
And these are...
It's not a distinction that they wanted to earn
But at the same time
When you point a phallus
When you point a phallus at someone
It brings something from the ancient world
Into the modern
By means of magic
All these texts are always talking about
Bringing the future and the past into the present
It's the art of the magrus
To be able to do that
It is magic itself
So bringing that power back into the present
Is something that I thought was the goal
And so that's how I oriented my programs and teaching
The student that you see...
Bring her up again, please
That's such a...
I'm so proud
This method actress
Who thrilled on the stage
And everybody said this was the best thing
That this university has ever produced
Full houses every night
Sold out the counters at the seminary
Off the charts for dirty internet web...
Internet traffic
You know that you hit on
When you get stats like that back
Anyway, I'm so proud of what she was able to do
She was able to bring that lady Babylon
She was able to, at that very time
When those fallacies were pointed at the audience
And when we brought them the fury
You could hear it crackle in the air
You could feel it within the audience
When we brought them the figure of that fury back
And said, your greed stains your soul
With a stench of ruin
That's when we had the victory
The students saw it and the students knew it
So when I was fired
It was upsetting to a lot of people
Because what you're doing is you're cutting off
The very source that you claim
You're a museum, you're supposed to be
You're supposed to have access to this information
Well, that student wrote me
She graduated and she went on to act
Started her acting career
And she gave me a note
That I have to this day in my jacket pocket
People want to know my motivations
And what makes me want to do what I do
Her note said, dear Dr. Hillman
You have shown me more of Christianity
Than any of my priests could ever do
Thank you for the education
And I thought, yeah, that's why
That's why you do it right there
Yep
So for those of you who are going to be
Coming to this class tomorrow
What I'm offering
What I'm offering to you is
A hardcore preparation
For intermediate level reading of ancient Greek
This is your hardcore intensive beginner course
I will be more of a drill instructor
Than anything to you and you will get tired
And you will complain that your muscles hurt
And I had just had somebody in for the first time
And he told me after a
Workout he said I didn't think it was going to be so tough
Right?
Yeah, because that's how you have to be able to burn through
What is piled up over that strength
That inner strength
You have to forge ahead with that
And that's what I'm here to do is to show you
You can see what happened in my situation
You can see what happened
And you can know
That I was not going to back down
That I was going to bring the authenticity
I was going to bring the news
Right?
And I wasn't going to back down
There should be no censorship
Despite what you may take
What you may be willing to endure
You should not be willing to endure
The rape of the muse
Now having said that
We have an issue to deal with
And that is there have been
Cersei has reported to me
That there have been issues with misogyny
On this site of all places
For misogyny to be
Where we study and venerate a woman
We study and venerate a woman
If you want to say we worship femininity
Well, what kind of misogynists would be welcome
Yeah, if we're going to follow the oracles
And if we're going to look at that media
Because the real history is way more interesting
Than what you're being given
What I'm given
The real history is way more interesting
When you get down into those texts
And you know that
You people know that
That's why you want to come tomorrow
Right?
The ones of you that want to take that route
I'm offering you a specialty here
I am Ronan
You can see that from the video
I'm on the outside
Great job
Got a lot of attention
People said this is real potential here
And these theories, right?
These theories are going to change things
Yeah, yeah
And all I was doing was giving them evidence
Hey, you guys
There's a whole bunch of drug books
These people are all on drugs, right?
And they're using it
But giving their infants opiates
Right?
All the time
Why?
Oh, watch
Slows down your bowels, right?
Get a little diarrhea
And take some opium
Feel better, get some sleep
You know, this is part of our culture
That's all I was giving them
Those were the theories
The things that they said were theories
That's what
And it's catching up to them
It's catching up to them
The place that we have to go now
Is we have to say, okay
We've started the magic
I see the pact
I know what direction this is going
I understand now that I am in an implicit agreement
And I will know consciously
When pieces of this agreement
Including what I need to do
Are provided, are given
And one of those things
Is this clothing thing
Next, two weeks from now
We will have a fight club
Yeah
It's the
Get your outfits on
Fight club
Neil will be the champion
That one challenger will be able to
To challenge
Yeah
Now, here's the setting
We are following a Saturnian initiation
In order to do that authentically
You must follow the Roman legionaries
Yeah, isn't that neat?
This is preserved with them
It only makes sense
It's always the officer corps
Who's involved in these aristocratic types of goings on
We want that Bacchic
We want that common democratic Bacchic worship
Yeah
We want that Bacchic fever
We want that Minatic feminine religion
So, we follow the greatest Greek manly hero that ever lived
And that is Heracles
Heracles was remanded to the custody of a queen
By the oracle
Yeah, by the oracle
By the oracle herself
So, this is pretty serious sentence
And it is there that he develops the understanding
Of the queen's lingerie
Now, some of you are delving into the sources now
And sending me messages that say, oops, you said this
I didn't think this was right
And there it is
This is a problem that I've had in the past
With a lot of people
People always say, no, no, they can't be
When I tell you that Jesus Christ is arrested
In public park or forehand with an achid boy
You're like, oh, no, that cannot be
And then you look it up
And then you say it can be
And it is
And that's my reality
All right
So, what I would like to do
What I would like to do is to give you access
To that initiation pathway
And in order to do it
We have to revive that classical gymnasium
And we are going to do that in two weeks
Following the Heraclean understanding
Of the Bacchic woman's kit
The Minatic kit
This is the dress
Of the right
And if you are Heracles
You are wearing very nice lingerie
Very nice
This is a Queen's lingerie
All right
So in order
You know, I could just tell you
It's because one of the misogynists
Snuck on here
Started saying stuff
The pig has to be sacrificed
Right?
This beast that wandered in
Has to be sacrificed
And now we all have to wear
The kit of the Minet
I will be there as referee
It will be three rounds
Best two out of three
The first of two falls is out
Person by person
Mano imano
This is wrestling, right?
It's a gymnasium
And I will present questions to them
That will allow them to master
Or submit their opponent
All while dressed in Minatic kit
And people that I'm talking to
Are, you know, we have a good group now
But I would like a few more members
To join
It'll be going to the games night
We'll extend the time
And I think you'll see
Why this whole gymnasium thing
Is so necessary
You're getting tired of one voice
You need to see the laboratory
And you need to see how it's integrated
And how we turn these things
In the body movements
We need to get the muscle memory
Of it
And how are we going to do that?
We're going to follow Jesus
Right?
Where's my dolly?
I want to know where he touched me
Right?
We're going to follow Jesus
Because Jesus, now I'm speaking
To those of you who are evangelicals
Presbyterians, Catholics
Charismatics
Who's popular now?
Mega church people
Sitting in the giant stadium
Joel Osteen type
I'm talking to everybody out there
Who fits that description
You know
And I'm telling you
That not only was your God
Arrested in a public park with a naked boy
But the institution that built itself
Around that pedophile
Is an institution of pedophilia
Yes
Yeah
I published a book
On it in the early church
And you know
Several professors told me
That's what's going to get you fired
But what would you have me to do?
What would you have me to do?
You people have entrusted me
With your time
I don't need to sit here
And give you garbage
I want you to have access
To that clear stream
And in order to do it
We're going to have to watch men wrestle
Dressed in classy
YouTube-friendly lingerie
And when you can do that
When you can do that
You can enter the state
Ask yourself
Why are bonkins always?
And so as you know
I was writing to Neil
To tell him about this
You've got to
Get out of the platinum wig
Don't bring that dirty blonde stuff
Don't bring the dirty blonde
You need platinum wigs
That hair should be wool
It should be the color of wool
Because we're going to Jesus
And Jesus in the apocalypse
Where we find Lady Babylon
Jesus is wearing
A lingerie top
With a wig of wool
Yeah, just beautiful
Beautiful platinum hair
Why is he doing that?
Because he's the morning star
And that's what she does
Yeah, okay
If you understand initiation
Now you know why
John has taken his boys
To the wilderness
I wanted to read
To resurrect to you tonight
Tomorrow morning
It'll be good to see everyone
Assemble
It'll be nice to meet you
To see you face to face
And we'll get to work
Right away
I want to finish tonight
Because what
I feel like I haven't given you
What you've come here for
Because we've just talked about me
So I want to bring up
To balance me
I want to bring up just for a minute
Charles Baudelaire
And his
Band poetry
Can I read you just
Four lines of his band poetry
This is from the Fleur de Maul
The Flowers of Evil
Are you ready?
This might be painful
Within the dwindling glow of light
From languid lamp
Sunk in the softest cushions
Soaked with heady scent
Hippolyta lay dreaming
Of the thrilling touch
That spread apart the veil
Of her young innocence
You're dirty
This is dirty
Is it just me here?
Have we entered the
This is Charles Baudelaire
And as you are reading
Charles Baudelaire
The Fleur de Maul
Which you will
As you come across
The Saturnian verses
Don't be surprised
That what I am saying is
Just what another dragon
Said before me
These dragons who stand
In the field of Mars
Did you ever wonder why
Madea's face, why her song
Stands in the field of Mars
You know
It's because we're at war
We're at war
And that's why you guys
Are going to show up
Heracles is going to show up
Confident and strong
As the object of sexual desire
As the look of the gaze
Yes, you won't let it faze you
You'll stand up
You're secure enough
To stand up
To feel the gaze
And to stand up
You'll embrace the lingerie
And embrace it
I know I will
I had this
Since we're talking about me
And let's just keep talking about me
When I was in Israel
People have asked me
Well, if you're helping us
To go through this
Why have you done this before?
Very organically
My initiation happened
When I was in Israel
And the people in bed
Were sitting up and telling me things
And then running off the next day
Crazy like
When I was there
A group of women
Descended upon me
I don't know, it's probably eight
Yeah, and they took me back
To their dwelling place
Yeah, and they stripped me
Of my clothing
It was
The locals were celebrating a festival
This is near Armageddon
Tel Megiddo, anyway
The locals were celebrating
A religious festival
So it was time to go out and dance
They stripped me naked
And reassembled
My clothing
With the kit of a minad
Yes, they did
They gave me just a gorgeous dress
And took me out
As if
We were one big drunken troop
And the dancing
Oh, the dancing was spectacular
The dancing was spectacular
I ended up in the end
Running like most do
From the Balkans
I ended up, you know, running back
I found I was safe, don't worry
Everything was fine
But in the process
Of that initiation
I realized that I had a tool
Against every misogynistic impulse
That I would ever have
Yes, you see why you need the Balkans
You see why you need the minads
Tell me Charles, Charles
You're telling me about Hippolyta
And her innocence
Can you tell me about
What's the name of your next poem?
It's Condemned Women
It's Condemned Women, that's interesting
The two good sisters
Wow, that's another one
Can you tell me something a little bit
A little bit darker or deeper?
You could tell me about the fountain of blood
You could tell me that
You could tell me about the allegory
Can I read the allegory?
Picture a beauty
Shoulders rich and fine
Letting her long hair trail
Into her wine
Talons of love
The poisoned tooth of sin
Slip and are doled
Against her granite skin
She laughs at death
And flouts debauchery
Those fiends who in their heavy pleasantries
Gouge and destroy
Still keep a strange regard for majesty
Her body strong and hard
A goddess
Her eyes call mortal beings
To the charms of ready breasts
Between her open arms
She feels she knows this maid
This barren girl
By our desire fit to move the world
The gift of body's beauty is sublime
And draws forgiveness out of every crime
She knows no hell or any afterlife
And when her time shall come to face the night
With a capital N
Show me death like a newborn
Face to face in innocence
With neither guilt nor hate
Those of you with ears to hear
Will see her
And will know her
Where is that Englishman?
Rob, is Rob here?
Rob is not here yet
He'll be here in a minute perhaps
And perhaps I'll just in the show
He's probably doing something he shouldn't
Nasty man
We're here at the Field of Mars
We're here at the Field of Mars
Here he comes, but before we jump
We're here at the Field of Mars
And for those of you who don't feel
You have any obligation to defend
The great mother
To stand between the great mother
And the pollution of this existence
Right now in Ukraine
You and I are witnessing
Mothers and children being wiped out
Being wiped out
We're witnessing nations
Stand back and watch it happen
We're watching people justify it
There is something that rocks
Even the heart of the most stained fascist
And that's the mother
We take on the kit of the mean ads
Because we honor the great mother
Yeah, we make this space sacred for her
Rob, how are you doing, sir?
Oh
Yeah, hi, how are you?
You're all right, I was excellent
You know, I like hearing about your history
Excellent story on Israel
Is that Tel Megiddo?
Yes, that's Tel Megiddo
Yeah, and it was an excellent excavation
And everybody knows that on two of the nights
That I was there, people sat up out of bed
And said very strange things
And a very strange voice to me
It was a powerful experience
In a powerful place
And I will never forget
Riding horses through the valley of Jezreel
That's the way to go
Rob, what do you think about Heracles?
And his fascination with the kit of the mean ads
Profound? I always say profound
But it is profound, isn't it?
It's kind of a...
It's confusing to me
I'm going to be totally honest
It's confusing to me
To kind of emulate that
I mean, I'm not misogynistic
By any degree
But, you know, I just...
I don't want to come across as an opposition
In this, but I'm scared of it
I'm going to be honest about that
I'm scared of dressing up in lingerie
To be honest with you
And I don't feel like...
I support it completely
I'll support any expression
Would it help you, Rob?
Would it help you if I told you
That right now, behind these wars
Are people who are killing other people?
For doing things like dressing up
If you're a man like a woman
For questioning gender
For looking at masculinity
And femininity through a lens
That's not traditionally accepted
That the people...
You can just say Georgia, right?
Look at Georgia and what's been done
For the great mother
Could you consider it
For the sake of the great mother?
Consider it, I have
It's not something I haven't considered
Certainly I don't agree with
What people do in them countries
I don't agree with that
It's really daft, in my opinion
And I don't have much time for it personally
I often hear of these things
Because I work in a place that
A few guys who come from the European community
Come over and we require them
Because of the skills that they have
And they have these views
They do have these views
And it's not very nice
I don't...
You know, in England
You can express your views without having to
Suffer serious consequences for them
But it's also as an effect
On the way people think of you
And it's not a very nice way
Of going about handling oneself
In a situation that's...
It can be...
As you say, it's devastating
To think people are losing their lives
For such a situation
Where they're only expressing it
You should be free to express yourself
However you feel like you want to
That's my opinion of matters
Like that
I want people to be able to express themselves freely
Without any reprise or recourse
In any way, shape or form, really
You should still be able to do that
Express yourself
How you are
And be honest with you
And show it, be proud of it
Because that is you
What if we get a little more active about it, Rob?
And what if we say it's almost an obligation
Of a free society
To protect its mothering source
To go out and to prevent
The destruction of that image
The image of the mother
And is that what is...
Heracles bears the name of his mother
Right?
Heracles
Yeah
Which she doesn't want
She doesn't want
And there's a whole mythology
And cult ritual built around this
There's entire temples around these great labors
One of which is getting a girdle
And in the end, Heracles ends up full grown land breastfeeding
From the mother of the cosmos
Isn't that nice?
The queen of queens
If we're going to bring that queen of queen back into our trinity
Cognitively
Because this is all quantum physics that we're doing
Don't we need to commit
To that state of mind
Where you and I can sit comfortably
I need to sit
And I want people to know
I want people to know
I was reffing from the start
In my normal attire
And it was Rob who said
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
We're going to all be dressed
In Victoria's Secret
But you're not
Right?
So Rob, I appreciate that
And after consultation with the devil
In fact, you have me
You have me on a
It's a clause within the contract
But it's something I have to abide by
So I'll be there too
I'll be there too
And we want people
We want to use this exercise
To show people that
The menatic starting point
Is still living
That the mystery they said
Was something that you could bring
That was living
That was a process
And this could affect history
That's why I keep saying
Let's bring back Lady Babylon
She is that operation
She is that all-bridging tower
And to bring her back
We have to
Isn't it rational that
We have to enter into the state?
I mean, so many medicine men
Native American medicine men
Can't be that wrong
There's something about the necromancy here
That we're trying to bring out
And so I invite people
And I'm inviting people now
And I wanted people to see Rob tonight
Because Rob is as genuine
And as transparent as you can get
Of a human being
He's not trying to hide anything
Right?
He's a lover of the muse
And he will follow her
And I know that for a fact
He'll follow her
And he is having a difficult time
Yep
Considering the options, yes
Right?
So, um, yeah
I am
I'm sorry, you're right, yeah
And the way it goes for me is
If this is supposed to be
My path and my way then
I'll find out
I'll be shown
There'll be something
There'll be a signal or a sign
Or something that I'll recognise and follow
At the minute, I'm just frightened
I'm sure I'm not alone
I'm sure I'm not alone in that
And I'm sure there's many, many
Many who are ready to express themselves
And you've got me full support
Complete and full support
Me, I've got...
I'm like that
Whether you teach or learn, you know
It's, um, it's something I'll have to
See what happens with
So for our...
Our judge will be Cersei
Our judge will be Cersei
In one aspect
I will call the round
And Cersei will judge for the sake of prizes
And she will do so
By pulling the audience
By pulling the audience
So we will have your...
Your, um...
When you become a magus
And you step up
And you're wearing the...
You're wearing your feminine kit
And you're drawing that attention
When you become that magus
You will then have the capacity
To enter into the ecstasy
You will be at the point
That your mind is primed
For what the right can deliver
It's, again, it's not my rules
It's just from the past
It's just these texts
That are telling us this
Okay, not many detectives
Go to the crime scene
And put on the killer's pants
Right, not many of them
Go through and stick their finger
Into the bullet wound
Right, but that's
Because they wouldn't want to contaminate it with DNA
But that's what we need to do
We need to get down
We need to get down to the very basis
Of what these texts are talking about
In order to get there, Rob
I have to put on the kit
I have to be in that state
From the throne
Now, you will have evangelicals
Who will hear that
And who will readily understand
That we are following the way of Cain
Right, and aren't we then
Aren't we then preparing the place
For Lady Babylon?
Yes, right, yes
If you can get over
And this is the funny thing
I started this process
And I tell you what
I'm frustrated
Because every one of those gowns
Is going to make me look fat
Every one of them
Every one of them
And I have had a bad body image
For the last 24 hours
When I realized
What I was going to have to present to you
It makes me
The first thing I thought about this morning
When I got up
Is I don't want to eat anything
Right, I got to get ready
For this two week
And then I stopped myself and said
What?
What kind of reasoning is this?
I've put myself into a position
That I'm now reasoning in a way
That I don't normally do
Right, in a way that we can smell
Has the sense that comes from her
It's coming from her
If you are performing testicular tanning
You are never going to fill up with her
Right?
It's the wrong direction, gentlemen
And who knew that?
Better than anyone?
The greatest, most masculine
Greek hero that walks the face
Of ancient mythology
Yeah, so
If you are a Roman soldier
And you don't have a problem with this
Right?
It's because you respect Heracles
And Heracles
Is the glory of Hera
The queen of queens
Right?
That mother
That accepts you to her breast
Right?
You can't get there if you are fascist
I'm sorry
Something blocks you
Right?
You can't get there
That mother is a Nazi killer
Yeah
Yeah
So
Yeah, Rob, any final words?
We're going way over time
We're 15 minutes over
Any final words?
Observations from your vantage point
On what's going on?
Okay, I'm just glad I was on mute
Because I was laughing me out of time
That was fantastic
Thank you
Thoroughly enjoyed the episode
Everything's going on fantastic in the community
Snappy's doing a fantastic job
And a shout out to him
Because he's just doing a great job
On Discord
Encourage everyone to get on the Discord tomorrow
So we can do the course
I'll be on the Discord
And by the looks of the chat
It's going to be a busy morning
For you
Hang on
Yeah, thanks to
And thanks to Snappy
For the protecting against the Confederates
That keep charging in
Yeah, thanks
I think that's a particular American contingency
Of Confederates there
And guess what guys
Guess what guys
You worship a dude who was arrested
In a public park with a naked boy
Sorry
Yeah, Hail Satan
Hail Satan
See you tomorrow
