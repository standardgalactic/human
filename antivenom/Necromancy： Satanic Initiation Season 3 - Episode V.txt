I never meant anything I said Just spitting out everything I've been feeding
Evening from eating away at me
Never said anything I meant I never said the letters that I should have said
But so it's asking too much for you all to believe
When I say never meant nobody no harm When I say
Never was a cause for alarm Never knew what I was talking about anyway
Welcome back to Satanic Initiation
This is Arman and tonight we're going to do a little bit of trekking
We're going to rouse the dead We're going to bring them back
Our chapter tonight is called Arousing the Dead
It's very much like Isis, don't you think? It's fantastic, I love it
I'm going to read a little bit to you and hopefully get this trangong with some
Initiation Subliminal Trans-Trickery
Yes, tonight on Lady Babylon we will
Music
Fantastic, let's not waste your time. We'll get our half hour
So we start taking the poll for those of you who want to see Derek Lambert in lingerie
For a Fight Club event next Friday where we will
All of us put on the kit of the Menads will wear lingerie and platinum wigs
And we will talk, why are we doing this? Because we are taking back
We're taking back what our ancestors
What our ancestors pushed
Anything good, anything good in this American experiment, we're doing it
We're doing it and we're following that
And I think in the spirit of loving those principles of honor
We need to push back for Tennessee and for Texas
Where twisted sister cannot perform without being arrested for a felony
That's right, it's time for us to jump out
All those of you men who for no particular reason would put on lingerie and a platinum wig
Now it's time for us to do it
We need to take back Texas
And why? I suppose it's because we're just not going to take it
Yes, yes, fantastic
So I'm encouraging Neil and Derek to come next Friday for this event
And I'm going to let them know who's ahead in the poll Chewie
Is it yes or is it absolute? It's yes right now
Just by a hair you can answer the question
Would you like to see Derek Lambert in lingerie?
Yes or absolutely is the second response?
Definitely, definitely, yes or more assuredly yes
If you'd like to, wherever you stand
And hopefully we'll have that next Friday
I'll keep you appraised of the situation
It takes a lot of courage
Yeah, so give us, give us that, ladies give us that
Give us that, it takes a lot of courage to step up like this
Next Friday, tonight we're going to be looking at one of the chapters that is in my book on hermaphrodites
Some of you just watched the Gnostic Informant
We talked about drugs, we talked about ancient drugs, we talked about specific drugs
We talked about verbs that just express getting high
We talked about doctors using terminology to describe different types of drugs
The drugs that put you in different states
We talked about entails
This is one of the big things, getting that God within that possessive form right
This is all induced by the use of drugs, all by the use of drugs
And we've got to remember we're bathing our fetus
Think of a fetus, grab this image
Think of a fetus growing in a rich chemical bath
This design to burn off his mortality
Yeah, there's a place in your skull
It's right in the middle of your head, it's called the third ventricle
I will meet you there, I will meet you in the third ventricle
There is a spraying there in the middle of your head
It's called water of life
We can access this water, we can access it
Think of that fetus developing
You take it back into yourself when you perform the sacrifice
When that mother comes to you and gives you that miraculous voice of her daughter
And she is dedicated to the temple, she is on the drugs that will be making her abort
And we will be consuming that abortion
People said, it's not about drugs
You can't say that bro, how long have I been telling everybody here
Give me my moment, I don't usually stand back like this, but give me my moment
I've been telling you people
The people in the Bronze Age were using drugs and not just mild ones either
Not just ones that give you constipation
I'm talking drugs that are mind altering
Big ones, how long have I been saying, people in the Bronze Age were huge drug users
What happened today, they wrote up, New York Times wrote it up and it turns out they've got the hair
And the hair shows that they were on some heavy psychotropic drugs
It's not like they just had them, if they're detecting them in the hair, that's from long term use
That's a chronic baby, these were chronics
Yeah, chronics, those Scythians, I tell you, you gotta love them
It was dyed red, it was dyed red, did you see that?
With everything that you people have been studying and you know what I'm talking about
Things I can't say that I know, right?
People have been studying this, their hair was dyed, it was dark red, it was dark red
Isn't that nice? Isn't that nice? Fantastic
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about, you're there, this is gorgeous
I'm gonna read a little bit to you, I'm gonna read a little bit to you
Yeah, would you like to? Yeah, let's go, I'm getting instructions here, chewy
We gotta jump, we gotta jump now
Grant my drugs the power of arousal which got us
And with my concoctions preserve the germinal semen of life
Established in the flames of desire
Thank you Seneca, thank you Seneca
That should get us in the right place
There's a good reason ancient witches became experts in the use of sexual drugs
They understood that the manipulation of sexuality was a means of transport
From the mundane to the magical
Ancient philosophers studied logic, mathematics and natural science
In pursuit of personal enlightenment, clerics read signs of the sky and prognosticated
On their irracular significance in order to avert disaster
And to honor the gods
Statesmen pursued oratorian law in order to perpetuate the machinery of ancient governance
And as equally valued members of ancient society
Greco-Roman witches studied the ecstasy of sexuality
In order to resurrect a bi-gendered creator
A gynomorphic god who was the key to unlocking a multi-dimensional universe
Witches
For a young priestess who served gods such as Hecate, Priapus and Dionysus
The secrets of the natural world were not just for the theoretical musings of natural scientists
These educated women took an active approach to the cosmos by advancing the notion that the world around them
Particularly the human body could be actively manipulated
They believed they were not just spectators of a cosmic dream
But active participants in the progress of the universe's drama
Ancient witches were part of a long religious and medical tradition that predates written history
They were a bridge between the shaman of early human civilization and the philosopher of the classical era
The earliest written records of Greek, Roman and Etruscan civilization
Are replete with drugs and drug recipes used by priestesses and witches
The witches' understanding of drugs predates the written word
Even the palace records of the Minoans and Mycenaeans
The earliest ancestors of the Greeks to leave written documents
They show an awareness of the use of botanicals as drugs
It's old
You go through this old linear bee and a lot of lists you get are lists for the drugs that they're trading
It's right there, it's gorgeous, you can tell what they're doing
You can tell what they're doing by the drugs
Have you been to Cyprus? Did you get the Smyrna?
You know what that stuff smells like?
Oh god, I can't do this
I can't do this, it gets to me, just sitting here, it gets to me
Witches were never passive
They actively engaged the discipline and subject matter in order to advance their cause
With a clear unified agenda and laborious training in their arts
Ancient witches claimed to be able to harness the power of the natural world to perform supernatural feats
Their miracles were based in the reality of sexuality
As the witch Canidia said in Horace's epodes
With my own voice, I am able to draw down the moon
I can arouse the dead once cremated
I can concoct drugs of sexual desire
They can bring that individual back
Even after they've been, their bodies consumed
It's fantastic, I love this
They can also make the sex drugs
Yeah, fantastic
Makes you wonder about Mary Magdalene, doesn't it?
That Pope
Who cares that she has sex drugs, really?
She needs to be pardoned
Pope Greg the Great
You guys are hilarious, the watchers
They always know the best places in the universe
Witches accomplished the impossible by manipulating the mundane
They secured their environments for the tools necessary
They scoured their environments for the tools necessary to alter the natural world
And they used the act of human sexual intercourse as a springboard to affect their supernatural tinkering
It's fair to say that the heart of ancient witchcraft was sexuality
There's a good reason that so many ancient spells are concerned with intercourse
Witches believed sex was the cosmic magic that gave them their power
Drugs, let's talk about drugs
The desire to bend nature led priestesses of Hecate, Priapus, and Dionysus
To the use of potent plant and animal substances
These chemicals had dramatic effects on human physiology
Powdered aconite was lethal in very small doses
Opium latex from the poppy mixed with the juices of the deadly nightshade plant
Caused benumbed ecstasy
There's one for the biotech people
Benumbed ecstasy, you know what they call that?
They call that the chill, the chilling ecstasy
You can get heated or you can get chilled
You know what I'm talking about
You can get heated in the ecstasy
You can get chilled in the opium
That's how they expressed it in antiquity
You get chilled
One of the drugs used in antiquity that has entirely escaped the radar of modern scholars is snake venom
Venoms of various snake species were used as medicines, regulators of menstruation, and weaponized poisons
Don't you love this, ladies? Listen to this
If you have a cycle, did you know that you can regulate that cycle?
Did you know that you can flow when you want to flow?
Did you know you can turn your flow up and down?
Did you know that you can design your flow?
Yeah, turns out you can't
Listen to what these people are doing
That's medicine, this is all coming out of the midwives
Oh god, that's the medicine
Imagine, we just suffer the effects
Right? And for the sake of trying to control our reproductivity
We could put the kibosh on that
We haven't gotten as far though as to find the drugs that enable you to control your own menstruation
That's amazing
I love it, drawing down the moon
Because that manae is what the phase is that you go through in order to produce that communion
That communion is your unfertilized soul
Yeah, that you can abort
Yeah, if you can fertilize it and then abort it
Wow, now we're going somewhere
Now we're going somewhere, it's in the process, fetal
Loving the fetal stuff, fetal cells
They're doing this in antiquity? Yeah, they're doing antiquity
They copied them at middle ages
Right? They would take the bull out from underneath the virgin as she ejaculated
And they would give you that
Anal applicators
Yeah, good stuff
For antiquity, recognize the level of sophistication that you have to have
Remember Pliny, we had in Bible study
Pliny was the one saying, hey, they're just showing off
These magi are just showing off
They're just really good at these drugs
And you've got the one with 50-some remedies in it
It's good stuff, let's keep going
The Greeks and Romans recognized that snake venoms were potent biologically active substances
These venoms, when applied to the human body, caused physiological changes
That were readily observable by natural scientists and laymen alike
And were frequently quite dramatic
An elaborate mythology of snake lore appears in the earliest recorded Greek texts
Snakes are presented as gods, guardians, and demons
For example, the followers of Bacchus wrap snakes around their heads
The followers of Bacchus, remember the followers of Bacchus wrap snakes around their head
Right? These are vipers
Yeah, wow
Let me be Jesus, right? Let me be Jesus for a second
Let me give you water of life
Right out of your head
Right out of your head
Oh, God, it's delicious
You haven't drunk water until you've drunk from the waters of life
Are you thirsty? Are you thirsty?
You're gonna need an antidote
You're gonna need an antidote
That's why Nanna says, would they give them on a cross?
Anidote
Anidote
It's in the commentary on John
Love it
Love it
In the epodes by the celebrated Roman poet Horace
Canidia is presented as a cunning witch
Involved in the preparation of an infernal sacrifice
That is a ritual sacrifice to the gods of the underworld
As a witch or sorceress, Canidia uses snake venom, specifically vipered venom
To prepare sacrifices for slaughter
Vipers produce a venom that affects the ability of blood to coagulate
As predators, these snakes use hemorrhagic venoms to kill prey
But the complex protein toxins they employ may also help prepare their food sources for digestion
Venom glands and reptiles just evolutionarily develop saliva glands after all
And the poisons they synthesize are physiological active
When injected directly into the bloodstream
They recognize this, you can't eat these things
That's why you have to have the anal applicator
Did you ever wonder why that priestess walks around with a dildo?
Yeah
That's her wand
That's her wand
Sometimes they tie you down
I don't know, it gets questionable there, right?
Several popular mystery religions of Greece and Rome relied heavily on the use of vipers during their celebrations
And the iconography of this particular reptile regularly intrudes into the literature
With artistic representations of these same cults
Within the practices of these cults, vipers typically appear in the context of oracular transformation
That is, the vipers are represented as agents of maniacal metamorphosis
They enable mystery initiates to assume the madness characteristic of gynomorphic gods like Dionysus
Other snake species also creep into mythological references in very specific ways
That reflect the ancient world's fascination with gender switching and sexual manipulation
Remember these witches, right?
And they're developing these dotes and antidotes
And they're focusing upon sexual reproduction
Within the big tent of midwifery or gynecology
Think of that
Those of you who are evangelicals, hold your ears
Those of you who are in Tennessee, Texas, shout out to you guys
Open up your ears for a minute and listen
Listen to the fetus being bathed in the venom
Yeah, yeah
Genetic medicine, right?
For the biochemists out there who know what those toxins are capable of
And how they interact with human hormones
Yeah
We've got glorious stuff there, glorious potential
There's a potential for a whole new form of medicine
Yeah, I'm gonna have a guest on Lady Babylon tonight
To talk about such things
Some genetic medicine, maybe
He'll take us to that spring that I was telling you about in the middle of your brain
Oh, God, it's the water of life, baby
Stars, priestesses and sorceresses
There's no extra time tonight, so just hang on there
If you don't mind, priestesses and sorceresses who pioneered the use of snakebillings for the regulation of menstruation
Believed in a universe composed of various overlapping planes
The ancient witches cosmos is strikingly similar to the multiverse of modern cosmologists who study astrophysics
Scientists like Medea, Cersei and Canidia believe that the universe was divided into three realms
These dimension-like realms were given the names Earth, Olympus, and Arabus
According to Greek accounts of the origins of the universe, the three realms of existence all possess basic elements and unique inhabitants
Earth was believed to be the realm of air, the element consumed by mortals
Olympus was a plane inhabited by gods who breathe ether
And Arabus was a realm of demonic powers
These powers breathe and ingest dark matter
Yes, that's what they called it
That's not the name that I just made up
They called it dark matter
The Greco-Roman realms of existence are very much like overlapping dimensions of reality
The inhabitants of each realm are invisible to the other realms, but can communicate and interact under specific controlled circumstances
Witches were most interested in the interactions of Arabus, the underworld, with the world of earthly mortals
That's what they specialized in, the connection of those two realms
Ancient mythographers recorded traditions that the gods of Arabus could only visit Earth by accessing portals or gateways through collapsed stars
This dark star is picked up across time by lots of not-so-friendly groups
And the process of working through a darkened star is central to the work of the sorceress
You have to capture that wave of space-time distortion that those collapsed stars produce
It's too much physics, poindexter
I know, I have a hard time too, those witches were smart
You gotta be a mental gymnast just to keep up with them, it's amazing
Due to the fact that these immortal beings and infernal demons breached darkness or dark matter
It was necessary to remove or destroy light sources in order to sustain their travel
Poets like Claudion of the late 4th century taught that the dark matter of Arabus neither reflected nor absorbed light
And thus was incompatible with the earth realm where light is abundant
When the gods of Arabus visited Earth, they were forced to remain within dark matter bubbles
It's cool what he mentions, yeah, it's a bubble of dark matter in order to sustain themselves for the transit
So dark matter bubbles
This is what we get in the rites of Apollo that use this, these oracular practices
Underworld gateways, the power to draw down the stars in order to open gateways to the underworld became the purview of witches
By employing poisons that contain the power to manipulate the basic elements of the cosmos
These witches believed they were able to enable the gods of the underworld to access the earth realm
The element manipulating powers of their drugs manifested themselves by alterations in sexuality
Okay, quantum
Witch witches viewed as alterations of the generative power of their bi-gender goddess
They're drawing the generative power of their goddess
You see how this goes back to the, you know, why Paul the Apostle is walking around saying, you worship nature
Of course they do, you idiot
Yeah, Paul was it, not the smartest knife in the drawer, you know
The power to draw down the stars in order to open gateways to the underworld became the purview of the witches
The element manipulating powers of their drugs manifested themselves by alterations in sexuality
Their drugs could sexually inflame their victims or stifle their arousal with the force of cold chill as in Seneca's Medea
After she, Medea, called out every sort of poisonous snake
She gathered together her accursed herbs
She picked the death-dealing plants and milked the snakes of their venom and mixed them
The wild force of fire was in some, the power of numbing frost in others
So this is a good example of our polypharmacy, sorry this is a good example of our polypharmacy
We're almost there to the conclusion
I want you to see the, are we gonna get cut for this somehow? You think it's okay?
Let's show the mother, let's just take ourselves
Remember the movie that they programmed us with his children?
I'm talking to my 40 to 60 demographic
The movie that they programmed us with his kids
You didn't know that it was a giant drug trip, did you?
Hit it, give us the witch please
Step into the eye and soothe the smell
Poppies, poppies
Poppies will put them to sleep
Sleep, now they'll sleep
It's always some witch working at a distance like that
Putting you to sleep with a bunch of poppies
My god man, Virgil was growing them
Virgil has a book that talks about how to grow opium poppies
Why, why is that? Augustus was a, dude, Augustus was big into the opium
Marcus Aurelius, yeah, they were loving it
I don't see why not
It was all legal, can you imagine that?
A society where all the drugs are legal?
The only ones that they made illegal and they have laws against this
And Sisera prosecuted somebody for this
Is if you use a drug to cause death
Can't use a drug to cause death
Yeah, yeah
So, you know, it can be prosecuted as murder
The purpose of using these drugs was the attraction or liberation of underworld deities and demons
That is, these witches believe the gods of the underworld were readily available for consultation and interference in the activities of the fates
Just like our witch, right?
That we just saw
She's putting them to sleep from a distance
Perfect
Bringing them up from the underworld
Was a prerequisite for forecasting the future
And you say, oh, wait, what? Yes, right?
Looking to the crystal ball, baby, and see the future
That's that oracle sucking you in
You got the chilling or the burning, right?
Okay
Yes
The purpose of using these drugs was the attraction or liberation of underworld divinities
Summoning the bi-gendered queen goddess of the witches
Was a necessary step in commanding the forces of the underworld
The realm where all mortals eventually end up
This powerful goddess, Hakati, and her masculine manifestations were all guardians of the gateways to Erebus
Which is summoned, Hakati, with sacrifice in order to access her power to open portals
Remember, Kanadia, we were telling you about the witch who was preparing her infernal sacrifice
They would take little boys
Oh, god, they would take little boys
You can do a lot to extract certain substances, right?
If the witches have figured out, which they've known since the Bronze Age
That the human body is a factory for chemicals
Chemicals that can be used, you know
Called them elements of the blood
Seeds of fire
Yeah, the seeds of fire
All of a sudden, the evangelical turned on for a minute
Because he was like, what?
Yeah, you start to smell the Christos, don't you?
Yeah, you do
Yeah, we're controlling administration, right?
We're bringing it down to drinking that blood
It's the blood of the sacrifice
When you eject that chemically aborted fetus
With the drug, the burning purple that you're using
That is our communion
Those cells in that concoction are the healing of the nation
Yeah, isn't that great?
Hmm, now you know where you came from
Ancient priestesses and sorcerers
Viewed the underworld as a realm or dimension of the universe
Accessible through cosmic portals
Using their pharmacological crafts
They claim the ability to open these portals
For would-be travelers
They don't care if you can see them or not
And for those brave enough to consult the dead
Wait a minute, isn't Jehovah...
Wait, where's that Jehovah?
Where are you?
Are you here, mighty, mighty Jehovah of the highest?
Where'd you go, Jehovah?
He hates this
He hates this stuff, right?
He's like, don't you go consult these witches
These pharma case, right?
These users of drugs
Do you know why you shouldn't consult them?
They can talk to the dead
And it turns out that it works, right?
Bring this up, bring this up in your church
Say, wait a minute, how is this stuff working?
And it says that they're involving drugs, right?
It's because you as a Christian
Are not practicing Christianity
I don't care if you're a Catholic or a Protestant
I don't care, you are phonies
Phonies
And how do I say that?
Because I've seen
How the early church practiced
And you are nothing of a mystery
You are a fragment of a jaded past
Your faith is not the operation of a mystery
It never was
Yeah, you gotta go back to your texts, people
Evangelicals, where are you in there?
Go back, go back to your texts
Look at them, look at your texts
Yeah, that's what they need to do
Witch of indoor
Yeah, love it
Elijah's doing that stuff too
Elijah's into the drugs, bro
Now he can bring the fire of uranos
He knows what the purple is
It's that
Have you been talking?
Talking to the donkeys, right?
It's not at all difficult to see
Why the bishops of the early Christian church
Move the Roman emperor to declare the activity
Of witches to be illegal
And prosecutable by execution
They're not going to execute twisted sister, are they?
Twisted sister
We're not going to take it
To the great twisted sister
Let us not take it
Yes, let us not take it
The sexual magic of Greco-Roman witches
Presented an impediment to the spread
Of Christian mystery rights
Who they were
An impediment to the spread of Christian rights
These openly condemned communication
With any of the underworld divinities
Church fathers condemned the use of pagan magic
But they could not entirely wipe out the influence
Of witches on the Roman population
Drugs used by witches to treat gynecological problems
Had become an important aspect of ancient medicine
Just as they are today
You see they're fighting about the same thing
Nothing changes
Oh my, it's beautiful, isn't it?
The watchers, again, let me just say something
Watchers, they're like these humans, man
I know they call it the dung heap dimension
They call it the dimension of the refuse
The prison
Some of them call it the prison
And that's where we are
In a giant prison
This is your punishment
Yeah, yeah
This is your punishment
Keep them from their sexual magic
When they put on the clothes of a woman
A woman, dear
The disrespect of a woman
You know what we all need to do now?
We all need to put on the clothes of a woman
Yeah, supporting our twisted sister
Drugs used by witches to treat gynecological problems
Had become an important aspect of ancient medicine
Killing off individual witches did not put an end
To their broad influence and practices
Sexuality and magic were intimately tied together
Through the use of pharmaceuticals by doctors and midwives
Christianity tried in vain to wipe out the influence
Of these ancient witches
Yeah, fantastic
We're in the same place today
And that's why this can be very practical
This experience, this satanic initiation
Can be very practical
Because we are in a spot
We are in a spot where you may now see
They took down the Romans
Everything, the offspring of Venus
Could bring to the world all the beauty
What happened this week?
Yeah, what happened?
Somebody got fired for Michelangelo's David
Which is, what do we call it?
Is it neoclassical?
Is it drawing upon a classical tradition?
The Christians defeated the Romans
They know that the only thing that can stand against them
Is that queen, Lady Roma
They know their own texts acknowledged that it's her
It's her that will bring the spirit back
Yeah, it's her
And guess what?
She was celebrated in a mystery
Through the use of psychotropic drugs
We're gonna have a meeting after this
I will send, hopefully, we'll have a fantastic guest tonight
Talk to us about some neuropharmacology
I'm very much looking forward to it
I'm gonna zip my lips at it
I'm gonna listen to some great musings
There's some very intelligent people
That we're privileged to have time with
Yes, so thank you for coming
It's a satanic initiation tonight
For those of you who went to Wall Hall
And watched Neil as well, thank you
I appreciate your time
And Hail-Sate
That's better
