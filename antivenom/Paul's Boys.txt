Get out of the closet
I'm flying for peace, all things hidden will be revealed
I'm Freddy Kruger with the purple stone, Hail Satan!

Roots I cut and grow em, dip up all you token
Take two hits and hold it, the witch she keep you loaded
So good they want my mow it, I spit dragon venom
Through hell and through the heavens, hot fire is purple
I'm with the Ashy Ashman, where the horses ride
Flying through the night, I'm here for the promises
You feel alright, it's a promisey
She keeps it tight, got the costume on
All night, I'm with the fumigation company
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, this is the initiating apocalypse
I thank you for coming tonight and I have a couple of little announcements
We are going, I want people to appreciate Teddy Bass
Thank you Orpheus for the tunes
We have put together, and when I say we, I mean they
They have put together for you a study group
And who is they? These are veterans who have been through the program
These are people who have walked through intensive Greek
And they are going to meet with you on Saturday
On the myth and folklore
Myth and lore, sorry, site that were
On, what's it called? Oh yeah, discord
Which is aptly named
God, you have to be insane to use it
But the veterans there will answer your questions
About those exercises in unit one
How you should feel, should you be having anxiety right now?
That kind of thing, they're there and so far
What I want you to do is I want you to go there
And it is part of your course and you, it is a lab
Here's what I'm thinking, let's try to crash the discord
Chewie, you're going to post that, you're going to post that thing somewhere
It's going to be somewhere, post it now
And Saturday is the day for your lab
Saturday is the day for your lab, sometime
During the semester
As you're working through the course, I want you to stop by on a Saturday
Let's see if we can crash that thing
We have the largest ancient Greek course
In the world, everybody, it's you
We did it, you know what we did, we sent a message to them
We're coming for you, fantastic, fantastic
Let's get into it tonight, I know there's some stuff here
That people want to talk about, we're going to have some comments first
Because believe it or not
I read comments and email
And people send me email and I cannot respond
But I take every piece in my brain and I say
Look at this, look at that, it's like listening to a thousand
Different voices from all over the place
I love it, oh god, keep sending me the email
The good stuff, the bad stuff, the naughty stuff
The proper stuff
Stuff you can read in the privy
Let's do that, let's do that, keep sending it
What about your comments, I want to put a couple of comments
Yes, yes, go to the top first, there we go Chewie
Hit it
Thank you Armin for making me aware
Of this dark alley, I surely would have gotten
You would have, you would have that had gotten you good
But now you're free, you know what I mean?
The blinders are off baby, you can see
We'll be like gods
Knowing good and evil
You want to see tonight some good and evil, I'll show you
It's uncensored, good and evil
Hail the muse, you too buddy, give me the next one
Look at this people, if they don't get Armin to spank this guy
Oh please, anytime I can spank, I'm more, I am more than ready
While showing him the simple Google search
For biblical Hebrew, right, how many words did it have?
Right, do you see where we are?
This is where you get when the dark ages return
This is where you get, it's amazing
You mean people just believe things just to believe them
Even though it's contrary to reason, yes
Watch, oh I have a good one for you, give me the next one
Oh Semiramis by the way, yes Semiramis
Lady Babylon, love it, Armin raffled a lot of feathers
I love it so much, you can tell
You're into the research, trying to learn
And who goes into it, trying to prove a point
Corporal Clegg, you're exactly right
And that is not how the museum is
The museum is there to preserve that sight
To preserve that evidence, to allow you to look at it
And say what were these people doing?
You don't want to go and listen to the dude about the aliens
Oh my God
Oh God, those aliens, it's the ones with the heads, the big heads
We're back, watch this people, what are we doing?
We're dealing with people who are part of a system
And we're getting all sorts of stupidity
Let me tell you something, it's just ideas
Don't worry, don't worry, it's ideas and you can cut right through that
Cut right through that, fantastic
Look what he says on the second line here, wait go back, there we go Chewie
Armin is a role model, thank you, thank you
Yes, for all scholars and he's setting the bar higher
Than any apologist can reach
Do you want to see an apologist?
Let's expose an apologist right now, are you ready for this?
This is about genocide, okay?
This is the child's sacrifice to those who worship
The great destroyer of children
Hit it
No, not that one, oh Chewie look
Oh God, it's the film, hit the film, hit the clip, hit the clip, there it is
The more difficult problem is the children
How could God command that the children be killed because these are innocent
And I think what I would want to say there is that God has the right to give and take life as he sees fit
Children die all the time, every day
People's lives are cut short, God is under no obligation whatsoever to prolong anyone's life another second
So he has the right to give and take life as he chooses
Moreover, if you believe as I do in the salvation of infants or children who die
What that meant was that the death of these children meant their salvation
They were the recipients of an infinite good as a result of their earthly phase of life being terminated
The problem is that people look at this from a naturalistic perspective and think life ends at the grave
But in fact this was the salvation of these children and would be far better for them
Than continuing to be raised, say, in this reprobate Canaanite culture
So I don't think God wronged anybody in commanding this to be done
He didn't wrong the adults because they were deserving of capital punishment
He didn't wrong the children if there were any that were killed which we don't know
Because God has the right to take their lives and in fact they were the recipients of a great good
So I don't think there was anybody that was morally wronged in this affair
So what is happening?
The salvation is the death of the Philistine
The salvation is the death of the child of Canaan
I see, we pray to you Lord Jehovah, we bring you this sacrifice
Now for those of you who were disturbed by that cultic death of the Dark Ages
Look in the forecast, look in the forecast and what's coming
Read, read the signs, yeah that's right
Tonight we're going to go sign reading
I'm going to take you all into the life of the Prophet, the Haruspex
The one who sees the future and I'm going to show you how it's done
I'm going to show you how it's done
And I want you to understand the evidence
I'm not selling you anything
Right, I'm not selling you, everybody out there
Right, F the money
Right, okay here we go, here we go
And by F I mean forget
Here we go, give me that last comment
I want one more because this I thought was important
Look people, this was the first, the scariest
And after that the least scary comment that I've ever received
I'm Christian, fantastic for you Rob, fascinating stuff
Because you used to believe in Jesus, you're going to heaven
That's how awesome God is
I hope to see you there, me too Rob
I hope to see you there in the whole time
I'm going to be pointing at Jesus and I'm going to be saying
Where's the naked kid that you were with when you got arrested
That's what I'm going to be saying
If that's your heaven Rob
If that's your heaven, have at it
Because you know what, I'm going to love doing it there
As much as I'm loving doing it here
Hail Satan, hail Satan, hit it to me everybody in the course
Hail Satan, hail Satan
That's right, one quick note of happy birthday to Jesus
And we're going to hit the sermon, give it to him
Yahoo, yahoo, when's your birthday?
Everybody, happy birthday to yahoo
Happy birthday to yahoo
Happy birthday Elohim Hashem Jehovah
It was in the third century
Great, now we've purged, right?
Now we're going to step out of the capsule
We've gone back in time
And where I've taken it tonight is we're going to sneak in
We saw a little bit of Paul last time
But now we're going to wait
We're going to watch Paul as he's walking around
This is Saint Paul, we're going to see
What is this guy doing?
We know he just got high
He went to that third heaven and he had his apocalypse
Now what are we going to do?
We're going to look at who he's going to associate with
We're going to look at their relationships
And we're going to look at what they're doing
Paul is going to give you the biggest key
To understanding the ancient mystery
And nobody has seen it before now
Let's do it, let's do it, hit it, boom
Hit me with it, people, what is this text?
It's the letter, it's the letter right to Philemon
And it says, hey, it's Paul here
And you remember me, I'm the prisoner of Jesus Christ
Oh, and here's my buddy, Timmy
Timmy's my buddy
And who am I writing this to?
I'm writing this to Philemon, right?
I'm writing it to the, he's such a great guy
And he's all jazzed up and he's working with us
And his sister, Opthia, right?
Oh, and who's that guy? Who else are we writing to?
Oh, Archipus, who's he?
He's a fellow soldier, baby, he's got your back
Along with all the people that meet with you guys
When you meet
Hello to everybody, that's the beginning of the letter
Now, who is this kid, Timothy, that Paul is with?
People don't realize it because you see St. Timothy
Oh, whoo, right, and he's got, ha, le, ha
No, no, give me the next one
Um, don't let him, Tim
This is Paul talking to Tim
Timmy, come here
Don't let them look down on you
Because you're so young
Give me the next one
Don't let them look down on you, little guy
How old is Timmy when he's working with Paul?
He's a teenager
And that is not unusual
They're taking these kids with them everywhere
On all the missionary journeys
They're taking them
Jesus can't go anywhere without 12 of them
Following him
Am I gonna show you the lace days tonight?
Oh, I am, I'm just keep rubbing this baby in
I'm just rubbing it, rubbing it, rubbing it
It'll absorb
And when it does, it's gonna burn
Let's do it, give me the next text, here we go
So back to Philemon
What does he say? Okay, ready?
Now, um, now's the time for those of you who are squeamish
Just step to the back
Okay, get your bags out
You don't want any splashing?
Let's, what does Paul say?
This is for your koinonia
Your koinonia
The koinonia of your faith
Paul says I want it to be energetic
I want it to be engaged
In the knowledge of everything
Good in you
By means of the Christing
Okay, remember, these are cultists
These are mystery cultists
And the power of the Christing is a big deal
We're about to see, you're about to get to see
The relationship that is at the middle of Christianity
And Judaism
Wow, let's do it
Give me the next one, here we go
We're gonna get in deep, are you ready?
What do you mean? You want this thing to be energetic
You want it to be active
Like what do you mean?
Like a medicine or a drug
You mean this is a medical drug?
Everybody, duck tails, Dan, close your ears
They're using medical terms
Oh God, that felt good for some reason
And I'm not usually, you know
Usually gets my goat to have to deal with that right away
Oh, here we are
Penelope, we love you, we're bringing you on early
Please show everyone who's come tonight
What the cross hides
Please, thank you Penelope
Get some sleep, sweetie
Alright, let's go to the next one
Boom
What is it that Paul wants to encourage the development of?
He wants to encourage the development of Koinonia
And Christians will run around and say
Oh yes, let's go to my kind of new club
Right, what is it?
It's an association or a partnership
If you look down this thing, you'll find out
It has to do with marriage, human society
Give me the next one, please
Chewie, boom
And what?
Sexual intercourse
Does that say sexual intercourse?
Sexual intercourse?
Bacchus
Look, he's right here, the God's right here
Yay, it's the mystery
And what's that saying in Greek?
It says the Koinonia is something that you enter into
Right, what are you entering into it for?
For the sake of the beauty of the right
And who's it with?
It's with a Kunikos
It's with a Kunikos
Okay, wait
So this fellowship of the mystery
I'm starting to smell something
Did somebody leave their underpants somewhere?
I think historically somebody has left their underpants
And we are about to find them
Are you ready for historical underpants?
Give me the next one, please
Go for it
People, I told myself today
I was like, you gotta get these people jazzed up
With the dirtiest
Because that's what the Bible's for
Look at the Koinonia
This is the same route as Koinonia, right?
But what is the Koinonia?
It's that which is Bdellukton
Or Akatharton
What?
Bdellukton is pollution
You know what I'm talking about
You know what I'm talking about?
It doesn't smell so good
It's not purged, right?
That cup of abominations
That is what they're taking
They're taking that from this, right?
The Bdellukma
Or those pollutions
Are we all in the right place?
Hit the next one
Boom
And why are we doing it?
It's the sake of the Christon
Remember, this is all within the right
Yeah, yeah
Let's see the relationship
Let's see what's going on
Between Paul
And this dude
And another young slave dude
We haven't met him yet
Yeah, we haven't met him yet
Come here, Onesimus
Give it to me
Paul says, look, man
I've had a lot of fun
Right, and you've supported me
With your love
Right, why?
Because
The splonkna of the saints
Is rejuvenated
By you, brah
That's a direct translation
It even says brah
Now, what it does
Now, Chewie, it does
That's the word for brah
No, I'm serious
Chewie, here we go
Now, what is he doing?
What did he do? He said this is all
Because you rejuvenate my splonkna
What is going on between these people?
Give me the next one, let's find out
Watch people, hang on
For those of you
Whoops, for those of you
Who are interested in
Mysteries, puzzles
That kind of thing
Mystery in a modern context
This is it, watch how this
Watch the flow of this tonight
And where you end up
It may make you sick
It may make you a little bit sick
Are you ready? Splonkna
You know you love it
Was Paul talking about
Were the people who were saved
What are we?
They're what? They're inward parts
Especially the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys
Which in sacrifices were reserved to be
Eaten by the sacrifices
At the beginning of their feast
Okay, we got organs
Any part of the inwards
Spleen
Uterus
You know they use this word for uterus
There's like 18 words for uterus
In ancient Greek
And they're all like
What? The matrix
Oh god, it's gorgeous, this is one of them
This is an organ that you eat
Why? When you're trying to prophesy
You saw all the vampire
Enthusiasts out there just going
Huh? Right?
Oh, watch the blood baby
Give me the next one
They're also the children
Look at the Greek people
What are children called?
They're called those organs
That the prophets like the hadus specs
Eat
We call them children
Nummy num num
Give me the children
Wait a minute
Is this really going to go there?
Is it really? Watch
Just watch
He's the one saying it now
For those of you who are getting men
He's the one who's saying this stuff
Not me
Right?
I'm just here because this place belongs
To the devil
Fantastic, give me the next one
Give me the next one
You can even turn that word into a verb
You can splunk mail or someone
You mean you can eat the innards of a victim
After a sacrifice? Yeah
But look at number two
You know what happens when you do so?
You become a splunk noscopia
Enthusiast
Not a splunk noscopiast
What is that?
Look, I'm telling you
These are big Greek words
Big ones
Open up your mind
It means to prophesy from the innards
From the innards
From the innards
Okay
Is anybody else getting hungry?
Let's see how this works
Give me the next one
I'm ready for it
What is that splunk known?
It's the seat of your affections
It's your anger
It's that drive
I want you to look at a couple of lines
That you see in here
It's of love
Of love
You're splunking out of something to do with your love
And Paul is talking about this?
Yep
Watch what happens
Give me the next one
One of the lines
Has, go back
It's the seventh
Look at the seventh line down
Now, Duckdale's Dan
Or Captain Kip
Came up and said
Hey, none of this stuff is overlapping
And these words don't exist
And, you know
They don't matter to us Christians
Right?
Look what's going on
When we try to explain Paul
We get drawn right into it
You get linguistically drawn
I'm sorry you guys didn't know this
It's not
A magic trick
There are those
Who can do it and who can
Read the text
And there are those who don't
They just don't have it and they don't do it
Some of those that don't do it
Like to pretend that they do
And that's where I come in
And that's where any
Any of you who wants to meet me
On the field of battle
On one, I'll take your apology
And I will shred it
You'll be so glad to be done
With that interview
Oh God, give me the next one
Give me the next one, I love this
I'm getting bloodthirsty
Look at Honoi's travel
What's it mean to go to madness
And we see it in Euripides Bacchai
Having been put into that
State of madness
But here's the quote that he has
And it talks about
Love and the splank
Now with the love, give me the next one
And here's the problem
Look at the second line in Greek
Starts on the first line after
The semicone
Paidos
Paidos who posplank noisi
Ehipothon
That's theocritus
You see the splank
Noisi there
What's he talking about?
He's talking about a dude
Who has
Desire
Under the control
Of that little boy's
Splanknon
Let me say it again
And this is
Hellenistic by the way
This is Hellenistic, third second century
Right
BC, so okay
Okay, I'm getting it
This is the birth of the
Koine
That became so popular
There's other Koines, there's an Ionian
Koine at an earlier time
Whatever, there's Dorian
This is the Koine form of
Greek that became very popular
And this is how they're using these words
I am going
I am going to get
Desire from
From
That splanknon of
The kid
Who is saying this?
Couple of rappers
Couple of rappers
Yeah, in antiquity
Very famous ones too
And they're talking about another famous dude
Who sings about astronomy
And he's got
An interest in this girl
But you know
You know
There's always that burning
That
Burning for the splanknon
You know what I mean
Paul knows what that is
Paul
Confesses it
Give me the next one
Paul was one thing, he was honest baby
Yeah, we won't give any
Give me that, there we go
Here's the conversation
I just want you to see
He loves that myrtle, is her name
Right, just as much as goats love the spring
Right, but
What happens
He has that
Pulthorn desire
And it's driven
By that splanknon
Of the child
Give me the next
And there's the line
For those of you who just want it, I'm not making it up
There it is
He has that desire
And he's driven by that splanknon
Of the kid
I just said it three times
It's got to happen, poof
Out of somewhere thin air
That was with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane
Hit me with the next one, Chewie
Now, who are we talking about
We're going to investigate now
The splanknon
And what it is
And what Paul is saying about it
And what he's revealing
For the first time tonight
Look at who we're talking about
We're talking about
Cultists
Who were active in the mystery
Like Heracles
Aristophanes
Clearly
Pointed out
As a victim
Of the dude
That
Educated
Him
And that dude was
Kyron
And he had a whole bunch of other students too
Very famous ones
And what does Aristophanes say
He puts it in the mouth of Heracles
Who's knocking down my door
What do you
What do you come here like some kind of
Kintauron
You come here like his master did
Because what are they known for
They're known for their brutality
They're known
For their excessive
Brutality
And uncontrollable passions
A lot of times they're presented
With the ears
Of saders
Yeah, why who are the saders
Those are the guys with the constant
You know we don't have them anymore
But it's a constant they take a pill
And they get a constant erection
Yes
Yeah
Who's this guy
Kyron let's go to the next one please
Nope
That's not the right one
Nope that's not the right one
That's it
Well we know
What do we know about the Kintauron
Well
We know that somebody they're
At least now I want you to focus too
Focus on the anthropology here
This is not we don't care about myth
We're historians
We want that
Actuality
Just look at it anthropologically
What do you call somebody
When you call them a Kintaurophonus
You call them one who slays
Centaurs
Okay
Did you know
Heracles was the pedarast killer
He was
Give me this heroes next thing
Give me this heroes next clip
Watch what happens people
Kintauros
Well they're a savage race right
There's that brutality again and they give you
The place that they live
Again anthropologically just pay attention
What's going on
Oh wait a minute what's the last word
In that paragraph
H-S-C-H
That's a Seekius
You mean he talks about what a Kintauron
Is or what a Kintauros
Is yes he does
Look at he says Briggins
Briggins
Give me the next one
What do you mean Briggins
I don't trust these Victorians
They always screw things up so I'm going to the source
Victorians
You're so proper
You can't even talk about the
Pedarast without obscuring the history
Feel it
Feel it
Cross the pond
Feel it
Kintauros
Who are they
Everybody look at the first word
Leicester
Now for those of you who haven't been around
Satanic initiation for long
Lady
Haven't been watching Lady Babylon for long
For those of you who caught up
The last couple of weeks
What are we talking about
This is an ancient
Greek
Lexicographer
Who is defining Greek for us
So that we don't have to go
Through the Victorians
And all their privy business
Right
And all the psychological stuff
They had going on
We'll go right back to those crazy Greeks
And here he defines it
Kintauros
Leicester
Isn't that nice
That's the plural for Leicester
Who was
The
Kintauros
Jesus Christ
Paul the apostle
They
Were Kintauros
And that's why Jesus comes into the garden
When he's getting arrested
Raising his hands saying
I am not a Leicester
Yeah
Do you understand
There are people who kill these people
Yeah
Once you've been in it
Must give you
Must give you some kind of passion
Yeah
Must give you some kind of passion
Good
Kiles was like
It involved poison
You know what
Everybody knew Chiron for in antiquity
Is his drug knowledge
He was
Known as an exquisite physician
But particularly he was known
For his amazing understanding
Of drugs and how they work
He's the one
Who has the poison that kills
Heracles
Ultimately
He knew where to get it
He's got that serpent in the breast
He knows
Right
Okay everybody
Hit me with the next one
Let's keep this going
Now people it's going to get weird
It's going to get weird
I'm going to try to get the people in the back row
Are you ready
This splash is going far
It's a little bit smells like this
What do they call it
There was a Santorum
Or something
Kintaurost
How is Hesechias
Did we read the rest of that definition
We didn't oh we skipped his fades
Hang on they've got to see this
He told me the devil told me no
They must see that one
Watch guys he says they're
Leistai
These Kintauroi like Paul and Jesus
They're Leistai and they're titanes
They're those titanic powers
That's who you're getting
You're getting somebody possessed
By those titanic powers
You remember that older generation
Of divinities when the sons of god
Came and they taught
They taught us all about the drugs
You weren't there devil was
Watch what happens
Kai hoi paitarastai
Who else are the Kintauroi
Or the Leistai
They are the pedarasts
When Jesus Christ
When Jesus Christ
Don't change it
When Jesus Christ said
In the garden of Gethsemane
I am not a Leistais
He was disavowing
The pedarasts
Who were involved
In the circles of prostitution
He was disavowing it
He was saying no that's not me
He's still going to crucify
With two other pedarasts
Right now
How did I just show how
People asked me
Somebody asked me
A couple of weeks ago
Asked me how is it that
People have not caught up with this
How is it that you sir
Could suddenly have
An avenue
To this knowledge that nobody had
That's because of the muse
If you don't respect the muse
You get jack
You get jack
That's what this is
This is a dude
Writing to us
From antiquity
To tell us that your Jesus Christ
Was a pedarast
At least he was saying
When he was arrested on
I'm not a pedarast
I don't know if that makes you feel any better
Look at the last three words
Isn't that nice
What is the oros
Everybody to
Let's go to the next one
It's from oros
Again he says
Equals the oros
I'm dying to know
Tell me what is an oros
This is where they're getting it from
He's telling you
The derivation of the word
Is that it comes from oros
Fantastic
Let's see what it means
The end of the
Oh man
I knew it was going to go here
I told you
Wasn't he
A senator or congressman
A Santorum guy
End of the os sacrum
Look at the little word
In parenthesis after that
It says oropugion
For those of you who aren't big on anatomy
You know
Your os sacrum
It's this at the end of that little
Bone and you've got your
Your buttocks underneath it
Your back above it
Look what
Almond gave us
Almond said
It's identified
Well he does that in Athanas
Later down we get
Identifies with Tauros
Identifies with Tauros
Look at number two
Generally it's rump
People comfortable with that
I got a little comfortable with rump
Until I looked down and I saw in the parenthesis
The very last word is ura
And I know what that ura is
That is what the devil used
To bring a third
Of the angels with him
That's what he did
To his kingdom
He brought a third
He did it with his ura
He did it
With what?
Now it's typically translated as some
Kind of a tale or something
But let's find out what it really is
Keep going
What is that Tauros
For those of you who think I'm making this up
Look if you just look up Tauros in the Oxford
Look what they say
Bull
We all know Taurus
It's also a priest of Poseidon
Cool
It's a sign in the zodiac
And then number three
What does number three say?
It equals cojone
Oh that sounds bad
Also the pudenda mulliebria
Now as funny as they switched into Latin
So it wouldn't be dirty
Yeah
What are the pudenda?
We call them the pudenda too
Look it up
And mulliebria just means of women
It's the female pudenda
That pudenda comes from the word pudor
Pudor is
Something that you hide
It's how you hide
It's the hidden bits
Look what they're doing
Maybe those Brits with their privy parts
Were closer
Than we think
Nice job right
One for me for spanking Brits so much
Oh you gotta realize that
Sometimes they get it
Oh privy parts
Oh back one
What else is it?
It's the male Eidoyon
Wait a minute
This thing that the devil has
It's called the bull
It's also the pudenda
And it's the Eidoyon of the dude
The Eidoyon
Is the
What would you call it?
I think the scientific term is penis
Yes it is
It is
Yes
Okay
Let's find what the cojone is
Cause that sound a little bit rough
See what we're going
We gotta track Paul through his word
What is it?
We found it
It's the perineum
It's the perineum
For the scientists in the room
You probably just
Right
What is the perineum?
The perineum is the space
Between
Your anus
And your private parts
Wait
The bull
Are you gonna watch my
Splachna
Okay
Very bottom here
Second to last line
Bottom
Your glutes
Okay
We are in
We are sitting there
Hovering above
The perineum
Watching
The mystery
Sorry
Okay
Give me the next one
Look at what happens
The centaurs
You can talk about their clan
Or you can talk about their blood
That's interesting
Not really
But I wanted you to see that there's famous
Famous
Centaur blood
You didn't think we were going to get into the mystery cult
Without getting in the blood
Did you?
The centaur is that savage race
It's that half human being
Half horse thing
But then look at number four
Not only
Okay, let's wait on the pie that I'll stay
But look at number two at the very bottom
The pudenda once again
What is the fascination with these people?
Well, anthropologically, look what they're doing
You see exactly the language
Betrays everything about
Who the culture
You know, who the people are
Betrays everything
A pie that asks this
From the brutal sensuality
Ascribed to the centaurs
Did you know what that centaur did
To Heracles?
Do you know what he did to Jason?
You want to know why Jason knows drugs so well?
Some drugs you can be shown
Oh, my God
Sometimes I can't
I can't do it, he'll say it
And I can't do this
I'm just like, okay, demons
Thank you for the assistance
Thank you very much, but it's getting
So gross
That I don't want to continue
It's for you, congregation
That we continue forward
We press on
Watch what happens, because we're going to see what Paul does to this kid
Just wait
Give me the next one
What's a pie that I'll stay
We're going to go on to the next one
What's that pie that I'll stay
That's the lover of boys, mostly in a bad sense
We've seen this, right
Oh, yeah
Give me the next one
And you can pie that I'll stay
You can perform the action
Right, it's a
Quite a wide-spread
Concept here
To be a lover of the boys
Again, these
Are the concepts
Embedded in what Paul is using
And when I show you, it's going to
Here we go, hit the next one
Mmm, boom, boom
What are the quintriadae
What are the quintriadae
I just want you to notice, these are priests and Athens
Right
Who drove, that quintron is that
Spike again, that thorn
Right, and what does that have to do with any of this
Hit the next one
Hit the next one, oh
Because the quintriadae
Are based on the same root as the quintauros
Yeah
And what do these people do
They're those who are in charge of
Or who are
Overseers of
The mysteries
When you hear in antiquity
A dude
Who's with a kid
And he's talking
About the mysteries
Congratulations
You've made it to sacred ground
You've made it to the place
Of the paiderastes
You can call them
Quintauros
Or you can call them
Jesus
No, it doesn't matter
The language
Betrays the fact that this
Friggin cosmos
Is ruled
By people who
Believe in a pedarast
Moses
Show me your backside
God
Show me your backside, you want to know the only thing that
Initiate gets to see
Give it to me, hit me with the next one
All the monisms, by the way
Islam doesn't
Escape, they're also people of this book
Right, so
The monist religions
Of the world
You're anchored
You're built
On a foundation
Of pedarasty
Yeah
Is this K21
We are in K21
Yup, okay
So, here's Paul again
Braggin' about his
Caloopsin, his visions
That he's going to be having, his opening of that
Time, his apocalyptic
Understanding of the timeline
It's going to penetrate him
And it's, wait, what?
What happened?
He came to know
The Mustadion
Right, he came to know
The Mustadion
Paul is going to tell you how he comes
Hit me, we're almost through
Boom, hit me with the next one, watch
You know, he says
In other generations
It wasn't known so well
By the sons of men
Right, you remember
There was a time when we had sons of men
And sons of God
Okay
Among those men
Right, there wasn't
There wasn't this knowledge
It took a son of God
To bring
That knowledge
It took a muse
It took a Moses
To bring that
Knowledge
And what are they going to do with this?
Oh, God
Look at the last two words
We're talking about profetis
We're talking about prophets
Being in Pnellmati
Do you know what the mystery is for?
It's to take a prophet
And to put them in Pnellmati
And do you know what happens
When you're in Pnellmati?
That's when you get
To the third heaven
I don't know
I don't know, but I was
With someone
I don't know if it was in body
Or in spirit
But I saw
I saw
The expanse
Of the third uranos
Yeah
You know what comes out of that expanse?
Venus
That dove comes out
And that's why
Devil chases you around
Because of your splunkna
It's that
Kid's splunkna
That's driving this, watch Paul's going to say that
Give me the next one
Oh, God, what's he
Oh, God, we are all
They're going to be protecting you
What is that mystery?
It's the
Universal
Creation
For those who can share
For those who can share
In the epangelias
In Christoi
Jesu
Look at the last
Look at the bottom two lines
That first word, epangelias
And underneath it, ewangeliu
People have asked me
Who are those sources? I had somebody
Oh, they don't use that way because
Remember a while ago we said
Epangelia
Is a word that means the power
Of a prescription drug
The power of a drug that a doctor
Has given you the recipe for
Used this drug with these components
It's epangelia
Is its efficacy
Whether or not it's going to work
Does it do what it says
Uh-oh
Here's another medical term
Throwing it right in, don't be surprised
That your people are not totally separate
From the rest of the world
You want them to be
You want them to be able to do
What they're doing, you want to pay for
You want them to be able
Guess what
Furies don't care, genocide is genocide
Here it is people
Here's a reference for you
3.6
What are these powers
That we're going to be partaking of
What are these powers, what are these things
What is the mystery
Watch what he says here people
He says, I knew that man
I knew it, I don't know in the body
Or in the spirit, I don't know God knows
He was snatched up
Right into paradise
And I heard
I heard things that should never be
Spoken
Yeah
Go, never be spoken
Snatched up
Snatched up
Okay, these
This is the world
Of the vocabulary that you're dealing
With, with Paul and his children
This is the world
This is the world, the vocabulary
That is
The world of the lay
States
He's using
Lastic
Vocabulary
Okay, if I told you, oh I know
This guy, and all he does all day
Is he talks like he's a drug dealer
He walks around
He talks about this and way
And that and selling that and getting this
And going there
He's got all the jargon down
And he knows all the street
Terms of these things
He's always using
You'd begin to suspect
After a while that the person had
That knowledge of that vocabulary
Because they were involved
In the business
Jesus Christ
Paul the apostle
The author
Of the Septuagint
There, that is the Torah
Right, the Torah is a translation
Of the Septuagint
That Septuagint
The author of that
They know
The same specialized
Terms
That Paul
And Jesus Christ knew
That were involved
In trafficking
And drugging children
It's all over there
All over their writings
It's like a fingerprint
It goes there
Right on the scene
Kids laying there all beaten up
Watch what happens
Watch what happens
I know it's tough
But give me the next one
Oops, did you lose it?
Chewie
You've been hitting the ale again
Those are the ones who know the mystery
We got that
Taking up to the third heaven
We've been there
Next one
I'm going to ask you
You know what I mean?
Concerning the boy
I just want you to know
He's my boy
I
Made him
In chains
Paul is very affectionate
For Onesimon
Onesimus
He's very affectionate for me
Onesimus
He's a kid
And he ended up
He belonged
To Philemon
And ran away
He stole some shit and he ran away
And Paul has taken up
A real affection for the kid
They met in the penal system
In Rome
And he was like, dude, weren't you the master?
Didn't you belong?
Oh, so they got close
And they got together
Do you know how it always works?
It always works this way
Yeah
You're dealing
With the lace stays
You're dealing with lace stays
Give me the next one
He wants Philemon to take him back
And he says, look, I'll pay anything
Anything he stole for you, I'll pay for it
Because this boy is mine now
And he says, look, at one time
He was translating
At one time, he says, this kid was totally useless
Now, however
He is very
Useful
To both me
And you
Do you understand?
Okay, okay, good
Chewy gave me the hairy thumbs up
Yeah, let's hit the next one
And what does Paul want?
Philemon to deal with this kid
He says, look, I sent you
I sent him to you, right?
Because who's carrying this letter?
Who do you think's carrying this letter?
Right? Paul's still got, you know,
Judicial system stuff to work out
Who do you think is carrying this letter?
It's the kid
And what is he said? This kid is my splothna
If you are lace stays
If you are condauros
You know what that means
He's my sweetness
He is that tool
Whereby I
Am going to prophesy
He is that thorn and flesh
I don't know if I was actually there
I don't know
I don't know
Now, all throughout history
There's theologians everywhere who have said
Oh, Paul the Apostle, he was a very
Luxual, very smart guy
And they look up to him and you've heard sermons
There have been sermons preached for
2000 friggin years
About this guy
Who is using children
They've become useful to him
Because you remember, you realize
The master was saying
What?
You become like one of these little kids
You're not going to enter the kingdom of heaven
Some of you
Are going to be made eunuchs
But people, this is how you have to ascend
Baby, I told you
I told you it would be disgusting
I told you, but this is your reality
This is our text
This is our language
Give me the next one
You're just going to connect a couple of dots here
Look, what is onesimus?
Paul is a little bit
A little bit of a flirt
With the egg heads
And what does he do?
He makes a little pun
Because onesis is
Something that brings you joy
Something that is profitable
Or delightful
Isn't that great?
He is my delight
If I walked in with onesimus
And I was like, yeah, he's my delight
Baby
And I'm going to lift up those serpents with him
You would think
Oh my god, this man needs to be burned
Now you know
Why Paul is going from
Prison to prison
Now you know why
The apostles are getting caught
Haven't you ever wondered
Why don't they just go to the suburbs
And have a big church
Why are they going to jail all the time?
This is your god
This is the dude
Who was
Burst by the guy
Who grants us
Spells
This is the guy
This is Jehovah
This is us
You know what I'm talking about
He grants us to be able to get together
Did you have that picture of Paul
Again from last time?
Where's that one?
Paul and his buddy
Do you have a picture of Paul on his
Paul
And onesimus
The boy who brings you
Advantage
This is the mystery
Take care of him
Take care of him
Paul is writing
A very affectionate letter
In a very
Profitable business
The business
Of prophesying
Through the innards
Of the boy
You mean
That's why
He had so much knowledge
You know
Yeah
Give me the next one
DuckTale Dan
And Kath and Kip
Can never
Can never tell you this
Because all of the
Have you noticed that all the sources
That we're looking at
This is stuff that they would miss
So what is the Koinonos
Right?
In that thing that Paul says
He wants to develop with his boy
That Koinonia
What is that?
That it's a partnership
A fellowship
It is a joining
A union
It becomes the number two
Because it's a joining
It's a union. Give me the next one
Boom
See where it's from
Look what Paul says
This is what I want
Right?
If you're going to put me in this position
Take this kid
As if you're taking me
So
The closeness between the pedarast
And his
Object of
Pedarasty
Is
The communion
The communion
You thought just because you've heard the word communion
Go ahead fill them with the crazy
Images, Joey
Just because you thought you've heard the word communion
And you sit there Sunday and they say communion
And you vomit out
This guttural visceral
Response
Communion, I know what communion is
When you take and they give you a little wafer
And you pa, pa, maybe it's a Baptist thing
And they have little things, a grape juice
And they give you a home
You take it, oh, blood of Christ
Communion
Voila
That's an antiquity
The real
Christian
Communion
Is between a man
And the boy
Who he is teaching, the mystery
Okay
Sometimes
You gotta have a co-pilot
If you want to jump the rift
Hit me with the next one
We're gonna go ahead and pull out of this
Watch what happens
Okay, come on brother
Right, you know what I want
Yeah
So, mu, ta splachna in Christoi
What does this thing do?
What does the splachna do?
It causes you
To enter into an astinia
An astinia, that bottom
That very bottom of the world
That pre-death
Inability
To function as a living organism
That thing
Relief
We've got relief through the
Splachna
And how is this all happening
In Christoi
Okay
You are sitting
On top of
Peterasty
You are sitting
On top of it
Your culture
Has preserved it
Hit me another one
Yeah brother
Now listen to King James translation that comes out
Yeah brother, yeah
What else is yeah?
Let me have joy of thee in the Lord
That sounds suspicious right off the bat
Wait, what?
Refresh my bowels
In the Lord
Refresh your bowels
Refresh your bowels
Now you're gonna sit there and you're gonna say
Oh no, no, this is not
As dirty as you are making it
He wants him to refresh
His bowels
Okay
Watch what happens, hit me the next one
Oh god, why am I doing this all?
Right?
Make, this is what Paul says to him
He wants him to refresh his bowels
Which is a terrible translation
He wants him
To nourish that kid
Who is so useful to him
And he wants him to treat him
As he treats him
He's sending Heracles out
His student
And there's another pedarast
That he is giving control
Over that kid
And he tells them in Philemon
122
He says
Also, I want you to
Make me a bedroom
Because
I hope
That I can fulfill
Your prayers
And I can
Haridza you
Wait, what?
What's he gonna do to him?
Is this something pedarast on pedarast?
Is this kintalos to kintalos?
Let's see, what is this last?
Haridza
What's Paul wanna do?
What's Paul wanna do to all these people
In this house where they meet
With these kids
He wants to grant him favors
He wants to grant
Him favors
Now
You can sit there in the closet
All you want
And you can say
Dirty, dirty, dirty
You, sir, or dirty
You can sit there and do that
But ultimately
You've gotta make a decision
Do I follow where all this evidence is leading?
Do I watch the language?
Do I learn from the language?
Or do I close my ears
As a jury?
Do I close my ears and say
I'm not gonna hear that part
I'm not gonna take it into account
Right?
That's what atheists do
Watch the language
Here's the English standard of it
At the same time
Prepare a guest room for me
For I am hoping that through your prayers
I will be graciously given to you
Now that's what
The pedarast teacher
In antiquity
In the first century, in the second century
That's what they say
If they know people
Are listening
What's the raw translation?
I'm gonna give you erotic favors
And I've got a kid here
And that kid
Is useful
And I want you to take care of
Yeah
Fantastic
Alright, you can see how the lay stays are working
You thought gangsta P
You thought gangsta P was a little more intellectual
A little more highbrow
No, no, no, no, no, he's a lay stay
It's just like the rest of him
Give me the next one, Chewie
We're almost finished
I just want to leave you with a couple of thoughts
Here's another boy in there
He's a younger guy, right?
But okay, I just wanted to see there's another one
Give me the...
Just so many of these
So many of these
What's the purpose of all this?
Paul spills the beans in Philippians
He wants that power
He wants his erection
And that
Joining
Of the passions
Yeah
He's gonna morph himself
He's gonna take himself
Into that death
Do you know what you do with your petarast?
You get
Your mortality
Burned off
With petarast
You know who ultimately made
The immortal
Guess who?
Was Chiron
Through his knowledge of the drugs
Finally
People are gonna say, look what he's doing
Look what he's doing
He's talking about all these people on drugs
He's talking about all these Christians
All these Jews, all these people throughout
History using these drugs
For their religions
There was a time
Nobody ever
Nobody ever teaches on Mark 321
Nobody ever teaches on Mark 321
Do you know what this says?
The dude's family
Came after him
Because he was out
Of his mind
And who's the dude we're talking about?
We're talking about that drug
Using Jesus Christ
Give me the last one
Just so you know I'm not making this up
Here's the NIV translation
When his family
Heard about this
They went to take charge of him
For they said, dude is out of his mind
I'm telling you
It uses the same
Verb that's involved
With ecstasy
The state of being
Under the control of a drug
Jesus Christ had to be
Picked up by his family
Because he's so drugged
He's talking nuts
If you haven't been there
You don't know
This is the dirt
This is the dirt from antiquity
Your religions
You monists
Your religions are built
On this dirt
Have a good night
Thank you for coming
And everybody
Crash that
Server tomorrow
Come in and ask questions
Of the graduates who are there
Oh, and it's at 12
East, no, Central
12th Central
Check it out
And ask them
Tell them, hey
I'm having problems with this now
They are your TAs
When I was at university
This is the system
Professor
Lecture
Laboratories
TAs
To help you
People who have been there
For people who are calling
Or sending me questions
About textbooks
All of those questions can be answered
Not only that, but those TAs
Can tell you, they can say
Do not buy
A biblical Greek textbook
Our material is far, far more
Rigorous, complete
And classical
Don't
This kind of thing, they can all tell you
They're veterans, I salute them
I salute Nancy
I salute Ion
We're supposed to be getting fish back
Fish
You guys love fish
Ask for fish
Okay, thank you very much
For coming tonight
I don't want to waste any of your time
So that's everything I prepared for you
I hope you have seen Paul
I hope you have seen the mystery
I hope there is coming a day
When this friggin' world
Gets punched in the friggin' nads
And wakes up
Hail Satan
Just give me a taste
Of hot purple
Kiss me in the smoke room
Scythian arches of doom
Spells, weaves, carpets and looms
My D.M.L.C.
My Athena
Death of a creeper
Fashion gibbets
For child interferers
Sleep with the devil
And then you will pay
Sleep with the devil
And you'll be taken away
You must pay
When you enter the gates
A Babylon
For all that you did
The throne
Laces, wrecks, I.M.B
Cash and checks
Doctors do dreams
Purple rain
Athena doing her thing
You can hear me knocking at the door
I'm in the purple suit
Statenalia
Here we go
Wolf's brain
Theory act flow
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
