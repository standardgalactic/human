Sunday morning, dark clouds rising, oh there's no sunshine anywhere.
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom to grasp the message in the air.
Oh, if I could have one wish and know that it would come true,
and wish that God would give us strength to know just what to do,
then we could tear down the fences that fence us down in.
Fences created by such evil men, then we could tear down the fences that fence us down in.
Maybe we could walk together again.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation, Season 6.
Tonight, I've got to take you to a place, a place that no one else has taken you before.
I've got to show you some things that are difficult.
We are going to be pulling them right out in front of you.
Yeah, yeah.
Tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to go to that grotto.
I'm going to take you guys to a place and show you some things.
I need you to be professional.
I need you to be courteous.
And I need you to be ready to get rocked.
Tonight, I'm going to take you to a couple of tags.
Well, more than a couple, but I'm going to take you to some tags.
We're going to be tracking down this, this ancient pirate.
I'm going to take you to a place to show you the latest.
I hear that Yoda in there, guys.
Love it. Love it.
Okay, before we do, as per usual, let's appreciate productivity of the muse and answer the question, who are we?

episode, that Jesus was calling himself a laystace. He's saying, I am not a laystace.
And for centuries we have translated this as a robber or a thief or a thief. Tonight
you're going to find Jesus wasn't crucified with thieves. He was a laystace crucified
among child traffickers. Let's go to that first text. Where am I going to bring this
to you? No theories guys, right? We all got patted down at the door, right? You can't
have any theories. Devil doesn't put up with that, right? This is straight up text. Bring
us up to that first text. This is just a warm up, but in order to get us to that place,
in order to bring you in, I'm going to have to bring you Opus. Opus. Opus is what? Opus
was a very good mantis. He was a prophet. And what did he do? He didn't put the girls
on the tripods. No, by God. He didn't do that. He had them. He didn't take those holy potions,
Apostin. He didn't take those holy potions. His group was the one that had the kids running
around. Had the kids running around. And what are the kids doing? Take it down. They are
dancing. They are dancing, but not just dancing any way. You know, the Greeks were quite clever.
It's the word for dancing as if you were a randy goat. Children dances. Yeah. Where have
you come? Where did we? We stepped out of the space time ship tonight and we didn't realize
how far we had gone. Captain's log. Yeah. So here we are. Here we are. Thrace. I'm taking you
to Thrace. Everybody put on your right gear, right? This is Thrace we're talking about. I'm going to
take you to some women. They may scare you. I'm going to take you anyway. I'm going to take you
to some tattoo. Oh, let's go. Let's go. Hit us with the first text after office. Chewie. Start
chart. There we go. Okay. This is Herodotus. This is Herodotus. And what do we have here? You know,
I'll just translate it quickly. There's a custom among this other group of thracians. What do
they do? They sell children in the export business. They sell children in the export business. Any of
you watching who are asking questions about the child trafficking? This is not me talking. This is
the text. So what are these thracians? Do they sell children? Yeah, into the market. And what
else do they do? They don't guard the virginity of their girls. They let them pick whoever they want
and sleep with whoever they want. That's what it says. That's what it says. Now, they do buy brides for
great price. He says, you know, I can go up. So they do, you know, because they're traffickers. They're
traffickers. Thracian traffickers. Wait, before you give up and leave the party. Okay. And those of
you who are waiting for Jesus and his naked boy, just wait. Just wait. It will make sense. It will
make sense. We have you have your back. Fantastic. So what else can Herodotus tell us here about this
tribe? What are they doing? They have tattoos and they think it is, it is. Oh, I hate to use this
word. It's highborn. Highborn. The eugenics. Oh, goodness. It's just right there. So they think the
tattoos are for highborn people. And those who don't have those who aren't highborn, they don't wear
the marks. Right. Fantastic. Are you getting along in the party so far? Welcome. Welcome. Fantastic. Look at
this word stigma. Stigma. This is the tattoo. Right. Right. Look at it. Number two. It's also the mark
on the skin of the dragon. It's the mark. It's the mark on the skin of the dragon. Yeah, it's the mark
of the dragon. Yes. Go to the next one, please. Yep, that one. Go back to that one. There's still some
good info in this. Let's squeeze. Let's squeeze Herodotus. So and what else? They think that working
the ground is for morons. So they make their living. If you look at that last line, they make their
living from war and leistos and from being a leistis. So what is their occupation? What is their
occupation? They go around plundering. Yes. Yes. Babylonian hordes filled with ranks. Rank after
rank of these horsemen. These horsemen. Do you remember guys? The prophet. I think you say you
mispronounce it. It's something like a Habakkuk or something, but it's ambakum. And what did ambakum say?
We're going to see ambakum in just a minute. Just sit down. Sit down. We'll get to bring up the next
one. That was Herodotus. Every round of applause for Herodotus. Now, you want to argue with some
sources, argue with some sources, but where we are is we're in the middle of that camp. And I still
got to take you to the grotto. I promise you something great on this date. I'm going to take you to the
grotto. I know. I know. People say if he says he's going to take you to the grotto, it doesn't mean
what you think it does. Yeah. Yeah. This Greek is gorgeous. This Greek is absolutely gorgeous. Okay.
Bring it up. Bring it up. I promise these people action tonight. Where's the take the banner down
and bring that up. Perfect. Thank you, Chewie. This is Plato. I like to kick in a little Plato
every once in a while, but he says, look, get cut me a break. Right. And tell me how this works
with these groups of people, the soldiers, the laystates and the kleptos. Oh, wait a minute,
the kleptos, who are they? That's the word for thief. So when the Christians try to translate
into English, this word is thief. They don't know because they don't read these texts, right? Who?
Which one? Can you tell me which one of your pastors has ever read Plato? Okay. Now, I'm not a
big Plato fan. Right. And that's unusual. That's unusual for somebody with a classics background,
but I can't stand Plato. Yeah. Yeah. But anyhow, let's not bash Plato. He had a muse. So, you know,
let's let's honor him that way. But what what you're seeing now from Herodotus,
yeah, is the source of this thing called the laystates. And they're different from thieves.
Right. Some people, the Christians wanted to translate this so bad as thief. They did. They
tried thief, robber and conspirator, conspirator. This is not, this is not a conspiracy.
Yeah. These are cultures. This is a group of Thracians who do this, right?
Remember the story we had a long time ago in the beginning about the Thracian pirate?
Who captured that beautiful young boy. He put that young boy to sleep. And when the boy woke up,
he was a new creation.
That pirate cut off his testicles.
Because some Unix choose and some don't.
Yeah. Yeah. There's a reason the bandage was on the private parts of the naked boy that was with
Jesus when he was arrested. There's a reason Mark tells you I'm bringing it up. I'm bringing it up.
It's coming up in just a minute. Let me not keep, let me not. Go ahead. Get hit me with the mark now.
Just jump ahead. Pull up Mark. Yep. Thank you, Chewie. Go for it. Blow that up. Here he is.
There's our nannieskos, right? With that diminutive for little boy, right? Because they do it before
puberty. He didn't know Jesus was involved with castrating boys, did you? Nor did you know that
John the Baptist was involved with certain rights. Yeah. Baptist rights, drugs. This is fantastic.
We're going to see the drugs and everything, but here we've got the boy, right? And what is he doing?
He's wrapped. Where's he wrapped? Do you see the phrase epigumnu?
That means on his privates, on his privates.
Now, when that aforementioned boy ran, remember this is before Jesus says,
I'm not a laystace. What'd you come out with all the big guns for? Right? It's before that.
Okay, let's go back up to the top. We'll get back there. We're going to take a round about
crews tonight. Thanks guys for doing it. Let's just throw that up there. This is from Alice.
Everybody take a look at Alice's definition of the laystace, right? Especially by C,
bucking here. Calling bucking here, right? Okay, later, perates, right? Okay, good, good, good.
Irregular troops, right? Kind of mercenaries like you would call them, right? Oh, wow. Now,
using them, tyrants and stuff. Fantastic. Fantastic. When you're a thration, you can get funneled in to
a type of living based upon what your, you know, what your ethnicity is, because by the definition
of your ethnicity, you're not going to do any farming, right? Yeah, but you make great laystace.
Yeah. Yeah, let's see him. Keep bringing him. Keep bringing him. Does anybody see
the next, next passage? Yeah. So here it is. I'm just going to throw it all over the Bible. I think
this is what Matthew, what Matthew's version, because it's in every gospel. The pirate is in
every gospel, right? He's hanging between two pirates, one on his left and one on his right.
This is Mark 1448. Bring it up. Yeah. And Jesus answered them and he said, yeah, why did you come
out against me? Like I'm a pirate with, with weapons that are military grade weapons,
right? My iron, that's a military sword that's meant to do nothing, either run you through or
chop your head off. One of the two, one of the two disembowelment. The Romans were into disembowelment.
That's how they get you, right? It's close. And then the Xulon, that's a, you know, something to
smash your brains out with, right? It's a, it's somewhere between a taser and a bullet. Yeah.
Yeah. Um, definitely lethal force. He's like, why'd you bring out this all out against me?
Because you can see the pirate. The Leicester Sin Antiquity was part of an association,
and I'm part of a corrupt criminal organization based upon different cultures
that had been doing, that had been making this living for centuries. This is Bronze Age stuff,
people. How long do you think humans have been cutting off other humans' testicles?
Right? We're about to meet, you know, the women that are involved in this, right? The echidna is the
echidna, right? These people are on drugs. These people are on drugs. Fantastic. So any who, any
who, Jesus is there with his boy, right, saying, I'm not a Leicester. Let's go to the next Greek.
Look at this people. When the kid fled, this is funny. Most people don't see this.
Um, when the kid fled, he left that linen wrap or bandage, right, that was covering his nakedness.
He, he catalyponed it. What does catalypon? I just want you to see. I just want you to see
the kind of comedy of this. Go ahead. I think that's it. It was, it should be right on it. Yeah. Yeah.
No, no, no, no. That's not, no. Do we miss it? It's the one. It's a real short definition.
Real short, real short. Chewie, they're getting us, Chewie. Let's get out there.
No, no, that's not it. It's just a short few words. We'll find it. It's okay. There you go.
Perfect. I knew she'd pull it out. Nice. To forsake, abandon or leave in the lurch.
When that kid that was assigned to Jesus, because that's what the Greek says, it says like a slave,
right? When you, when you give someone over as a slave, that's what it says about that naked boy.
He was that to Jesus, right? So anywho, he's got this bandage on his private parts.
All right. This is right before Jesus is yelling, I'm not a lace-dace, right? You have to please,
people understand. Jesus Christ is standing in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy,
raising his hand saying, I'm not a lace-dace. No, no. They're concerned with robbers.
That's a clap-dace. This is a lace-dace. So Jesus is in a criminal organization.
One would think if he is screaming out, I'm not one of them, okay? Either that,
either that, there's only one other explanation.
It looks like he's a lace-dace. The cops who are the Roman soldiers are going to pin it
on something, right? When you are sitting there under lockdown in a jail,
you are there in the Roman system under a charge. Fantastic. The guy that they let out to pardon to
so Jesus can get crucified, the crowd, because at this point, the crowd,
he's just been arrested in a public park with a naked kid, and he's yelling out,
I'm not a child trafficker. I'm not a child trafficker, right? I'm not a child trafficker.
And now the crowd is yelling out. We have the Greek here, but the crowd is yelling out,
now don't give us some other person. We want him. We want him to get crucified.
There was a vehemence in the crowd. Now, the Christians would tell you it's because the
devil was there whipping up everybody, but we don't have, you know, we don't have the time or the
extra dimensional resources to go into the physics. We just want to see the history. We
just want to open up that little bit of history so we can see it. Let's press on. Press on.
I'm going to give you some fun, exciting stuff. Thank you for spending your Friday
evening with me, by the way. It's generous of everybody. Yeah, yeah. So at this time, you know,
Jesus said to the crowd, oh, you come after me right now. This one, this is Matthew or John,
I'll get Matthew. Okay. This one's kind of funny. It strikes me as funny because he's actually talking
to an oh, close, right? Which is like an unruly mob, unruly mob, right? But this unruly mob
is just imagine. It's not like people from all walks of society. It's full of Roman soldiers,
officers of the temple, and elders, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay.
It's a raid. It's a raid. And that netted Jesus and he gets thrown in
and crucified between two child traffickers. Isn't that funny? These are robbers. These are robbers.
Well, these are robbers at all. Wow. Right? So now that naked kid seems really relevant
to the whole equation. Let's bring up another one. That was another one. Yeah. Now this one,
I think, is Luke 22. Yeah. Yeah. And Jesus said, yeah, to those who were gathered out,
you know, the arch priests and the soldiers and the old and the, you know, elders. And he says,
you came out, you came out, you come out like you're all ready to take down a pirate.
Yeah. They were. They were, they had all the weapons. If they had chess cams, that's what,
do you see how different world history would be? If we had a chess cam of the officers who arrested
Jesus in a public park with a naked kid while he was screaming, I am not a child trafficker.
If we had that scene guaranteed, none of this, none of this would have done what it did.
Right? The accurate transmission of evidence. That's what we're looking for. Right out of his
mouth. Let's pull it out. Give us another bit of the Bible. Excellent. We're going to the good
stuff. Oh, look at this one. I like this one. Yeah. Here's, here's just to show you, just plain
as day. The word on the left, kleptase, that's your word for thief. The word on the right,
lace days. Right? That's the word. This is from John. That's the special word.
Yes. Now, Christians again, I know your instinct is to say, no, he meant thief. He meant insurrectionist.
He meant thief or insurrectionist. Yeah. Okay.
He should have used the word thief. He didn't. Jesus was not crucified between two
banditos. No, he wasn't. He was crucified with some people who were selling children.
Yeah. And if you'll notice, Barabbas, when they said, let Barabbas out, it said he was incarcerated.
He was enchained with them, not as one of them, but with them. It's very likely that this dude
was actually not with the gang. Anywho, he was preferable to Jesus who they had just caught.
They had just caught, right? People don't realize it, but there were other Jesuses
in jail when Jesus was arrested. He was not the only person arrested for what he was arrested for.
Yeah. He was placed among the pirates for your sins, evangelicals. He was placed between the
pirates and that little naked boy runs off in history, having left behind his bandage
that was covering his genitalia. He ran away. And you and I live in a world that worships him.
Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing grace. Now, for people who want to say he doesn't have text,
that's all I'm giving you. Please realize it's all I'm showing you, the text.
All right. It's not me. I didn't want to make this system with Jesus.
I didn't want him to be this way. I wasn't there when the dude got arrested, right? To me, this is a
cold case. Yeah. But what I do love is bringing you all that real dirt, that real dirt. It's
gorgeous. Give me another quote. Let's do just a couple more. People need to get on with their
evenings, maybe watch a nice movie or something. Yes. So look at what the crowd's doing. They're
shouting out, right? Don't, right? Don't. We don't want Barabbas, right? Right? The one that's the
laystace. Interesting. Interesting. Poor Barabbas. Don't you feel bad for him? Because it's like
he's there with them, right? He did something wrong. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was just
the wrong place, the wrong time. Maybe it was just a bad deal gone down. You know how it is?
Things happen. People end up chained up with a bunch of pirates. It's just the way it is.
Yeah. Fantastic. You thought he was in a ship, didn't you? No, no, no. Right? Not yet. That's
what they do with the kids. This eunuch that Jesus was with, right? This boy that he was,
you know, obviously he didn't want to be there anyway, right? Because he was like,
oh, I don't want to do this, right? Take this cop away. But my will, but yours,
he's all like, oh, I'm thirsty. He's rocking, man. He's on the poison. He's on the juice.
Let's look at some of the drugs here, Volv. Keep going. Yeah. This next one, yeah.
Yeah. So this is just Barabbas. This is Barabbas with those factions, right? Criminal organizations,
those, well, I wouldn't say mafia because it's not like family. The Romans have what's like
mafias. Don't be surprised, but they do. It's just fact of history, right? Powerful families rising
up and controlling the finances of the neighborhoods. That's all. That's all. Yeah. They tried that
math. Yeah. Didn't work. Power of the deem. Power of the neighborhood. Thanks so long.
Yeah. You see what we lost. We need this now more than ever. We need it. Love it. Go to the next text.
I want to give them good stuff. I know there's plenty. There's plenty of good stuff in here. Oh,
God. Yes, yes, yes. And Jesus came into the temple. Oh, look, this is part piracy that you may not
have considered. Now, I said this in the introduction. Uh-huh. I said this in the introduction. This is
Matthew, by the way. Yeah. I said this in the introduction that there were traffickers in the
temple. Traffickers in the temple. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't the thieves guild. For those of you
evangelicals who want to make the fairy tale, it was not the thieves guild. And it was not insurrectionists.
Yeah. Your glory days history that smells of the crack of Josephus and Philo. No. No. I'm sorry. It
doesn't. Things have to meet a standard. You know, there's standards. It's a museum. It's a museum.
Standards. Right. Okay. So let's go back to the text. Here we are. Here it comes. Something
boldly insulting, please. Um, yeah. And he came into the temple. Yeah. And he threw out all of those
who were, who were doing what? Look at poluntas. Do you remember what the Thracians,
same verb that it was using there? Now it can be just be selling of anything.
Yeah. Doesn't have to be children. Right. The verb doesn't have to be children. Okay. But he kicks
out the sellers. Uh-oh. And the agoradzontas. The agoradzontas. Agoradzontas. Yeah. Those
participating in the market. What are they going to give? What are they going to, what do they want
here really? Before he kicks over those tables and all that kind of stuff? Let's see the birds
flying. Why? Because we buy dubs for Aphrodite. There's a reason that Mary, the mother of Christ,
had a burning purple ooze in her vagina. There's a reason. It's medical. It's cult. It's mystery.
Were you getting all these terms? Christ. You think Christ, you think Jesus walked onto the scene
and he was the Christ? You think that title didn't come from a thousand years of history?
My goodness people. What kind of, you're willing to believe anything if you're willing to follow
fairy tales. This is history, anthropology. We need evidence. I want this guy's blood.
I want a sample of it. I want to see what he was on. Yeah. Fumigating. Go for it.
Yeah. Doing all his resurrections. Yeah. Love it. Yeah. Go ahead. Hit us with a source.
Let's go. And he came to the, yeah. Oh, and he throws them out. Yep. Yep. Yep.
And what does he do? All the dubs. He obsesses even the dubs. Oh, yeah. He stands and quotes.
Jesus, right? He's like after his big move, right? He says, what? He says, it's written. It's written.
And that, you know, I don't get anybody's attention, right? It's written. He's got to do his quote in
law over there, right? It's written. My house is a house of prayer. Prayer. And you have made it.
A what? A spay lion of pirates? A spay lion. What is a spay lion? Quick. You've made my house a
spay lion of pirates. Give me the next. This one I've got for sure. Yeah. There it is. Looking
at it, people. Look at it. A grotto or a cavern. Wait. A grotto or a cavern. What happens in
grottos and grottos and caverns? Does anybody know what you can do in a grotto?
St. Cyprian did. They caught him in one. Yeah. They caught him coming right out of the cemetery.
Yeah. Yeah. It was a beautiful area for, you know, gorgeous. And he had the venom
drilling out of his bottom with prostitutes. So-called. Yeah. Fantastic. That's where we are
cult-wise in history. That's where we are. If you are, and I need to make one note,
I meant to do this earlier, for everybody who's listening now, if you have not
been involved in rights that entail you becoming drugged, you have never participated in a mystery.
You have no communion. Yes. Yes. What you have now is a game. It is not the original.
Yeah. Yeah. And that's why it's so important to you purists who want the cup of Christ.
Right? You purists who want the cup of Christ. Bring it. Bring us to the next.
Yeah. Give it to me. Fantastic. Okay, guys. Ready for this? Look at verse 15. This is
Ambakum. Ambakum. Come in. Ambakum. And tell us, this is 2, chapter 2, verse 15. Yeah. Oh,
you dude who's causing your neighbor to partake in the flowing out tholetai. Oh, wait. And to get
drunk, getting himself drunk, getting himself methylated. What was you, yo? What was you?
Ololudo? Yeah. Hallelujah. You heard it here. Hallelujah is a Greek word.
Alaladzo. Alaladzo. Alaladzo. 800 years before Hebrew even existed. Fantastic.
Let's go. Let's keep going. I mean, it's right there. What does he say? What does he say? Oh,
that tholetai. We got to go back. We got to go back and see it. I've got it at the bottom.
I want people to eyeball it. Just so nobody says, yeah, you see it. Yeah. That one. What is something
that's tholetos? Yeah. Look at the, okay, muddy, foul, turbid. Okay. It's opposite to cathodos,
which is what you do in a purification ritual. That word is just purification. And in antiquity,
they have rites of purification and mystery rites are always purification rites. That's why
the Baptists are baptizing. You get it? Fantastic. So look at number Romanum or number two.
Wait a minute. Troubled by passion or madness. Troubled by passion. And who is that at the bottom?
Who is that at the bottom? Oh, that's Nicander and his Theriac and his Theriac. And how does he use
this word? Put it down. Remember Nicander for the Bible scholars and whatnot who don't know
these ancient sources. Nicander is a priest. Well, and he is writing specifically about the drugs
that are used in Ritu for the treatment of humanity. It's gorgeous. And he, he's really
culty and uses Orphic Vox. So this is one of the words that he throws in there from the Orphic Vox.
I'm going to kick you into a passion. You have to be there. You have to be there. This is the
grotto. Did anybody see that the grotto also meant the, can we go back to our grotto? Yep.
Let's go back, blow it up. Did anybody see, did we miss this? Look, the Brits almost snuck it past us.
Look at number two. This is that Spelion, the grotto. Yes, look at number two, the privy parts.
The privy parts.
I'm going to take you to the privy parts of the pirates. Yeah. And if you happen to see
young boys, don't be surprised. Yeah. There's a reason. There's a reason
that group that he was with, Brabis. Yeah. They were involved in a murder,
which, you know, these criminal organizations always are.
What is funding all of this? Lastic activity, pirate activity. What is funding it is the drug
money. Are you surprised? That's why we pardon Mary Magdalene. For her, what, for what? I heard
one of you say it. For what? For owning and or possessing sex drugs.
What was the date? What was the date on that prehistoric dildo? 36,000? I think it was 36,000.
Yeah, something like that. These devices go way back, polished stone.
Everywhere you go with one of these pirates, there's going to be an association with an erection.
Think of it as universal grooming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anywho, look, the trade is going on
in antiquity and it will continue to go on. By Jesus, it has been going on for a long time.
Yeah. And the Romans will keep trying to bat it down, right? Because Romans don't abide pirates.
These are not insurrectionists. These are organized crime families, for lack of a
better word, families. It's the local power brokers who are getting all the money from the drug trade.
You know how expensive the purple is? Remember, Mary's got that in her vagina when her midwife
gives her the exam. That is in the Coptic. Yeah, in the Coptic. Love it.
Okay, okay. Last couple of sources. Yeah, yeah. I ended us here with a good, yeah, go ahead. Look,
this is just a couple of lines in the candor. Look at these two dirty lines right here. This is dirty
in the candor. And I got to tell you, I just want to paint this image for you. And I want to thank you
so much for spending all this time. And I want to say, this is dirtiness. I just brought it. Look,
I just brought it because I knew you would appreciate ancient dirtiness. This is straight
up history. You can't get history like this elsewhere. This is the history of the, of the dirty.
Yeah. And it comes from that priest, that pagan priest of Apollo. You mean he's an
irracular priest? Yeah. He's one of these who operates the mysteries. Now, when someone tells
you today, if they walk up to you today, and they say to you, Oh, I am an initiator of initiates.
Yeah. Say, you're not a mystagogue. Yeah. I've got a mystagogue for you. And that's what's coming
through. And I need to get you to a place that you can see a priestess, drugging a person,
putting them into a death state, bringing them to climax, reviving them, and then chasing them
around, beating them as pigs. Yeah. That's the cult. That's the mystery. That's where we go back to.
This game is not just convincing you in a church. You've sat in churches. You've sat in
synagogues. Right. You've sat in your mosque or NELT. You know, you've heard the call. Yeah. None of
that. None of that has the element of the pharmacist from the pagan magic. Right. There's no magic in
faith. No magic whatsoever. You took Jesus, a magus, with an orific title Christ, and you neutered
him. You neutered him. You made him neither a son of God, nor a daughter. You made him neither.
Because you took away his magic. Dude, I'm sorry. I know you don't like the transitions.
I know. It's tough. The watchers, they're always telling me it's tough. It's tough. Uh-huh. It is.
They'll figure out. I tell them. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong, but I tell them they'll figure it out.
They'll realize that this movement from male to female is a step up. Yeah. It's a nature thing.
Yeah. And thank goodness it is. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Hail Satan. Great
mother is the great mother. What would you want? This planet, billions of you, worship the great
father who is not so great. Yeah. Kind of a misogynist douche.
Can I say that? Can I say God's a douche? Is that, is that okay with anybody?
Yahoo. Tell me in the comments. Can I say Yahoo's a douche? Can I do that? Jesus Christ is a
rapist of children, at very least making eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.
That's what we're going to do. We're going to take his words. We're going to take his words,
and we're going to pin it on him. Remember, he said it. You can make eunuchs one way or another.
He was making eunuchs. Oh my God. This is great, right? All you need is the evidence. You don't
have to have theories. Theories are BS. Just look at the, look at this, the text. The texts are
always more interesting when I see him doing this stuff. Guys, let me just give you this,
since you've stuck with me so long tonight. Let me just give you this as a gift. Oh God,
there is, I've seen a place. I've seen a place, right? This is the ritual. This is the ritual.
Water of life. If you ask me, I can show you water of life.
If you drink it from her,
these Amazonian women that I've been talking about, yeah, imagine, imagine
the poison in the bow that they're all using
is a poison that they have incorporated into rights to bring you to a state of being born again.
And in order to receive that, you have to drink her blood, right? Her blood
with the essence, energizing it. It's a pneumatic power that she transfers. And in that power,
you can imagine it. The application of the drug induces psychosis, psychosis.
You know why Jesus didn't want to do it in the end, right?
The stuff drives you nuts. We're doing the same thing in the Middle Ages. It drives you nuts,
turns you into a satyr, tuned on the Greek side, turns you into a satyr, and that's what Abba
Koum is protesting. Yeah, imagine seven days, seven days. You have a slave for seven days who
can do nothing but maintain an erection and be in constant fear of you.
That is genius. That is the stroke of the mind of a genius woman. Okay. Now, I know many people
are going to say he's fine. He's finally built it. He stepped over the line.
That right, that mystery right that makes the root of your Christianity and your Judaism and your
Islam, that right was created by the woman, by a single woman, a mind in history, one person.
Yeah. You're all under her spell. You're all under her spell. Now, you see why Lady Babylon must
return, must return, right? Gorgeous. Oh, God, I love, I love this. Take me to the grotto, right?
Please, somebody, are you out there? Right? Are you out there?
Embodied within this mortal. Are you out there? Can you bring me to the grotto where I may partake
of the water of life? It's a purification. It's a purification. Remember the Thracians,
they don't care if their daughters have intercourse. That's their business.
And who would anyway? A lot of those tribes, those daughters, they have to kill three men before
they can get married. Yeah. And by marriage, I just mean, you know, making your, making your man do his
nourishing stuff and then kicking him out if you don't like him. Yeah. Oh, if it's a boy, by the way,
adoption. Imagine that ladies, who has, who has of all you women here, for all you women, anybody
who has the spirit of Aphrodite in them, that spirit of Hera. Yeah. Which, you know, if you
could do this, I mean, how much do you really need that man? Seriously? How much in that society? How
much? Not much. Yeah. You got to kill three. I can't imagine killing one. It makes us look
rather weak, doesn't it? It does. Imagine this woman, right? Perhaps the poet was right.
Mars needs women. Angry red women. Yeah. So you can see the cult and where the lace
taste is coming from. By the way, these, these Amazonian or Scythian tribes, the women would
abduct men, right? In groups. They're always working in groups, right? You see the criminal
conspiracies have to congeal around groups. And if they become cultural, where you just have
pirates, right, who answer to no laws, but the laws of one very strong, central
in the Bronze Ages, women. Yeah. Yeah. Kick ass. Brilliant women who finally figured out,
this is what I told the watchers, have finally figured out you don't need a man.
How long, how long did it take for some group to say, you know what, we could do better if we
called these males, right? And we just propagate a line of very intelligent advanced ruling women.
And people in the 20th century turned that incredible historical reality into a friggin comic book.
Yeah. You anthropologists out there, you need to, you need to go visit those people.
And maybe answer the question of why it is that Athena has this child of earth. Why the
virgin grows this child of earth? Aren't all of us Athenians at heart? Don't we aren't we infused?
That passage of Nicander, it says it's her tooth, the tooth of the echidna that imparts that power
that drives to sexual urge. You see why you need Aphrodite? You need her after all. It's fantastic.
Drives your society. You want to stay free? You better start worshiping Aphrodite.
And you better get comfortable with transition. You better get comfortable with somebody else.
Cutting off their testicles. Yeah. You better. You know why the Romans had no problem with that?
Man, that's old tradition for them. They're like, yeah, we respect the gods, dude. They're doing that
to honor DK. You can't argue with that. You can't. You think the world is divided up into beliefs.
It's not. It never has been. It's the fake lens that you and I have around us from Judeo-Christian
tradition. Monist tradition. Yeah. Fantastic. Okay. Thank you very much for all your time.
I think that was all the goodies that I wanted to give everybody. It's been an hour. Nobody should
be listened to for this long. Thank you. I value your time tonight. And I hope that we have cleared
up so that people in the comments and chat that they can finally rest at ease with who this
lace-dace is. Why Jesus was saying he wasn't one? That's for another day. As long as you can get a
picture of that Thracian childseller. Yeah. The market is there. Right? The market is there. And
the stuff travels around. The Romans are trying to stop it. Right? Always. Always. You know,
it's just the way it is. Okay? At least we're trying to push civilization. Right? Law. Civilization.
We're trying. Remember, Judea is backwater. It's backwater. It's uncivilized. Yeah. It's
uncivilized. Right? There's no, you're not talking about, I mean, plumbing people. Plumbing. Okay.
We need good plumbing. Yeah. We need good public access. That kind of stuff. Right? We need places
for those assemblies so all those politicians can make their decisions.
Now, you've caught me in the wrong place. Have a good night. Thank you very much to everybody.
And I just want to say thank you to Zang Canva once again for all the fine music. And I hope the
people are putting together the little riddles that are hidden everywhere around us. Have a nice
weekend. Hail Satan.
