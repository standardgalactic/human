Musa Natha Medwa
I'm a powerful dreamer
On you I put a spell
Don't wait on the triple beam
Purple cup pressed down
Full of nova flow and wealth
Green and green jelly bean
Dance with the muse
Come with me
Point of pendant ring
Elemental peas
They love the kachinga ling
Purple paint base
Down with the yellow brick road
Charlemagne sugar ring
I'm laying
This dream is in mind
It's yours
And I'm honored to be in it
Rock on Hail Satan
With a cup full of violet
Vagina juice
You know what to do
Thank you Teddy Bays
For singing us in
I love this tonight
We're gonna go somewhere
Just you and me
Every minute of this
Every minute of this
I have some really, really tasty stuff
For you tonight
It's delicious
I want to tell you that I was just
Interviewed today
By classical
Wisdoms
Anya and oh god
One of the discoveries
That we'll make
So tune in
When you get a chance
Tonight I want to be
A little more intimate
Just between us
About halfway through
I want to hit you then
With a couple of comments
That you know
I just have to address
Just a couple of things I have to address
Don't worry, don't worry
It'll be lovely
Let's get started tonight
We're gonna make our way
Into the purple
I've got to show you
Some of those
Who were using and making
And distributing
The burning purple
I've got to show you tonight
Where would I start
Such a journey
You know what we're looking for
We're looking for pirates
We're looking for pirates
And tonight
We're gonna find pirates
Burning purple
What was that?
What was that?
We'll even find
Achilles
Fantastic
We're going in deep
Are you ready for this?
I'm gonna give you some of the gory details
And I want you to be
I want you to be satisfied
Because you came here to be satisfied
You didn't want
Look, what's he doing?
Chewie, what is he doing?
Because the ship is finally there
I want to
Pull you out of that ship tonight
And I'm gonna push you into Hyman
Hyman
What did you say?
I thought we were talking about
Pirates
We are, yes
And drug using
Pirates from antiquity
Yes, yes, we are
But we have to go to the Hyman
Who is
The child
Who is that blessed child, Hyman?
Who is that blessed child, Hyman?
Chewie, did we get any
Pickups of Hyman? Here we go
What is Hyman doing?
He's a great guy
You would love him
Absolutely loved him
How would you know about him?
You'd know about him, leave him up there
Because you'd know about Hyman
From the wedding songs
The wedding songs
The Greeks doing
They're chanting
Hyman
Who's his buddy?
Eros
We all know it doesn't go
Beyond Eros
You can even get to the devil
And plow right through him
Because he is
Subject to Eros
Yeah, power
That's real power
That's what makes everything
Fantastic
If you're going to get into the disguise
And be there with the purple
You're going to have to
Pick up some things
Are you on your throne?
Are you sitting on the throne?
Please, congregation
Have a seat
Fantastic
Before we get to the purification
I want to let you know Hyman
Was a good guy
And he saw, he's an Arcadian
And he saw
These girls getting kidnapped
He saw these girls getting kidnapped
By
Pirates
And what are they going to do with them?
You're going to see in a minute
They sell souls
Ancient pirates sell souls
Who do they sell them to?
Those who have their attention
Yeah
Okay
Let's dive in
To Hyman
Tonight
And see who he was
By the way, it's a great ending
Because Hyman is able
To bring us
Right into the heart
Of what
Piracy was all about
Right into the heart of it
Even so much so
That we're going to look at Jesus yelling
In a public park and for him
With a naked boy screaming
I am not a pirate
We're going to get back
To that zone
We're only going to hit that peripherally
I want you to see Hyman who rescues
These girls
Rescues them
What does he do?
He dresses up as a girl
And see the thing about Hyman was
He was so good looking
He was so good looking
You know
Boy, girl
Who cares man?
Beauty is beauty
And everybody said Hyman
Had beauty
Oh goodness
The songs that we sing
At marriages
The songs
Where do they come from?
They come from this
You know who sang this song first?
Orpheus did
At Medea's wedding
Fantastic
Where do you think all that purple was coming from?
Where do you think they were
Taking it and using it
From
Kolkis
Love it
She was Queen of Babylon too
Right?
Love it
I mentioned Medea
I want to show you something
I want to go two down
Slides
Go to this one
I want to show you somebody new
We're going to open up tonight
Are you ready?
This is never seen before
Never seen before
At least about 800 years
About 800 years
Because the nerd
From Byzantium
Constantinople
Whatever
This nerd
Who's a Byzantine nerd
Is reading all of this classical literature
What's your name again?
Eustatius
Eustatius
I'm leaving him alone
I'm not being rough with him
He's kind of giving it up here
Because he loves classical sources
And he has a whole bunch
That you and I no longer have
You mean he's got quotes
From some of the greatest minds
Of antiquity? Yes
We don't have those quotes anymore
Because why don't we have
Those quotes? For example
Aristarchus talks about
The stars being
Just like our sun
But further away
And we actually go around
The sun and
Around an axis
You want to see the angles?
Fantastic
Thank you
Eustatius preserves this
Why didn't he survive?
Because the
Anything
That doesn't fit
With the Christian
Perspective
Which is a
Biblical perspective
Anything
That doesn't fit with that
Gets burned
We leave it around
To mold
We burn it
Fantastic
What a great influence
What a great influence
Do you know why
We are
1,800 years
Behind?
Oh my god
Just wait until they find out the temporal commission
You know what I mean? You gotta get rid of that
You've gotta get rid of that
And you're
What am I talking about?
It's viral baby
It's the viral logos
And it burns your system up
What do you do about it? You gotta purge it
You gotta purge your system
Yeah, you gotta purge it
Let's get to the purge
Shall we? We're gonna bring back drama
By the way
By the way, I'm reaching out
Reaching out
Reaching back that stage
The museum
We're the ones who are responsible
We gotta bring that back
Who's the
Who's the title?
I wanna bring up that same
Chewy
Right?
Athena
Right? Ladies
Who is this?
Everybody recognizes
Ancient Greek y'all
Athena, right?
I prefer the
Dropping of those vowels
I prefer the more Dorian
Anywho
Athena
Latest
What is the latest?
It's a title of Athena
Well, tell me
What is Athena's title?
Athena
Yes, you can see it
The pirate
To Athena
The pirate
Let's look at her
Let's get ready
Is she gonna be involved in the purples?
Yeah
Is she gonna be involved with priestesses?
Yeah
Is she gonna have sons of
God
From virgin mothers?
By the power of the serpent
You bet it
Why wouldn't you give this to her?
Why wouldn't you give it to Eve?
Oh, God
Go hit me with the next
Let's
Yeah, hit me with the next one
I wanna
No
Take him out of the room
You're not up next, you are
There you go
What are we talking about?
Pirates
Isn't that nice, right?
This is all Eustatius is telling us
He's saying, look
What are these
Lacedatos
What are they?
They're what we're calling the piratas
Right, you can see
This is late Byzantine Greek
For all of those of you who are studying Greek
Remember our range is long
We got that old stuff with Homer
We got the new stuff in Byzantium
Right
So we gotta be able to
We gotta be able to do this
Let's go to the next one, give me the next one
Nope, not again, boom
Boom, who else can we drag up?
I wanna drag up Achilles
Did you know that Achilles
Dressed up like a woman?
Not really a woman
Dressed up like a priestess
Girl
Yeah, he did
Why did he do that?
Don't worry about why he did that
Let's see Achilles, bring out Achilles
Go ahead, fire up Achilles
So
What Eustathias is telling
Where is he doing
His official business? I want him up here
Doing his priestess thing
Because he's being raised with priestesses
Everybody knows
And Achilles makes a
Beautiful priestess
Yeah
He makes a beautiful priestess
She is so pretty
The day to me it fills
The day to me it fills
And love with him
Who is that?
Who is that?
That's Medea
It's another name of the many named
Queen of Babylon
Day to me
What does that mean? You know what that means?
Oh, you're gonna love this, are you ready?
Get ready for this
This is the girl
Who brings slaughter
This is the killer
Oh
Day to me
And she happens to be
One of the priestesses
Who is shielding Achilles
As a preteen
And teen
Oh, okay
What happens?
What do you think happens?
They fall in love
Right?
They succumb
To the flames of Eros
And Medea
Yeah
And Achilles
End up
Creating a union
That breaks all of time
It breaks all of time
What can come after it is only
It's wake
It shatters everything
Do you know who is in
Physian Fields
As the bride
Of Achilles
It's Medea
Do you know who it was?
That stood on the walls of Troy
Wait, what?
Stood on the walls of Troy
Shhh
Stood on the walls of Troy
And looked
At Achilles
And he looked up at her on the walls
And he said, that's you
It's you whose image
Has been in my mind
You have projected it to me
Wait, what's her name?
Helen
Helen, wait, who?
I thought Helen was
Helen was
Medea
Oh, now you get some of your bocancio
I told you
I told you
Let's go back
Let's go back to the text
Let's just keep feeding it
Okay, right, it's gonna
Right, we're gonna get some deep here
Yep, go ahead, next one
Here, blow that up, Chewie
I'm gonna put my old glasses on
Look, people, talking about
Achilles, look at them
Tell us, tell us, Ezekius
Neither
Achilles
Nor any of the other heroes
Ever says anything about
Being a pirate
But
Achilles
His own family line
Do you know what the name means?
Pirates
Yeah, he points it out
He says, but
He is a pirate
And
Odysseus
No
Every classicist
Sphincter
You could hear the chair
It was squeak
Why?
Because Odysseus, my God
You might as well see he was a drug-collecting
Freak
He was
He was a pirate, don't you know?
Ithaca is set up
Eustatius, thank you for telling us this
As a matter of fact, Eustatius
Give us the next one
What else?
That was Odysseus, by the way
He's a smug
He's the one who comes and gets Achilles
Pulls him out of the priesthood
Oh, God
And yeah
Bring us up the next one, please
Boom
And boom
This is the passage
That we're all concerned about
That Ezekius is telling us about
Okay, it's from Homer
And what does it say?
Because, you know, now's a good time
To question these people and figure out who they are
Since, you know, they ate their meal
And they're good
And he says, oh, strangers, tell us who you are
Where'd you come from?
Sailing over the sea
And, you know, what kind of thing do you do?
You got business or did you just roam
Marauding
Like those pirates
You know what they do?
They
Traffic
Look at that bottom line
They traffic in souls
It's such a
Terrible thing they bring
To their neighbors
Oh, God
You mean, are we back to those
Pirates again? Yeah, we're back to those pirates
What are those pirates doing?
Remember Jesus in the garden?
I'm not a pirate. What are they doing?
They're trafficking
They're trafficking in people
Tell us Ezekius, give us a little
More information
You remember Jesus when he's saying
I stand at the gate
And here I am and my sheep
My sheepies hear me
I don't have to
Be a robber
Or a lace-dace
You mean there's a difference?
Yeah, because the lace-dace
Is trafficking in souls
Yeah
What do you think
Jesus is doing?
Yeah, he's got 12 of his boys
So when you
When you infiltrate this cult
Don't be surprised
If you see Hyman
Fortunately for us
Hyman is there to kill us
Yeah, to kill us all
Kill us all
Only
Only this kid would be able to do that
Oh, God
Let's keep going
He leaves the picture up there
Yeah, oh, wait a minute
How old is this kid, right?
Yeah, exactly
Let's go
Boom, next one
Yep, we got it
I wanted to show you this, look
He says here, this is miraculous text here
Seriously, people, blow that up
This is miraculous text
Look at it
Oh, my God, they're trafficking in souls
And what does it mean Ezekius?
Tell us what that trafficking
In souls means
Right, he says they're doing it
To collect those
Individuals
For
Those who are in the
Love Market
You remember when Odysseus
Went away, a whole bunch of
Pirate knuckleheads
Tried to take Penelope
Why would they be so curiously interested?
You know what Athena
Told Penelope to do
Athena told Penelope to have sex
With every one of them
Which she did
Who was that offspring?
Oh, my goodness
Oh, my goodness
Hyman rescues
His beloved
He does, he kills the pirates
Oh, God, love it
Let us purify
Let us purify
Here's what I want to do
Are you ready for this?
We're going to go through a little programming
With Chewie here
And I want to set your mind
This is actual text
Translated by me
From Euripides
Roll it Chewie
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
And with that
We're in that Bronze Age
We're coming up to Pan
And we want to see
I want you to see Pan
And I want you to see Achilles
In all of
His glory
I want you to see Achilles
Serving through that
Spirit
Can we have Achilles?
Oh, God, isn't he beautiful?
Isn't he beautiful?
Let us keep going
With the text
And bring out
Let's go to the next one, Chewie
And hit it
We got a couple more SAR systems
Good
Here we come
Here we go, right there
Beautiful
This is the text that you just saw
Translated
I just wanted you to see it
Written up there in all of its glory
Hit the next one, Chewie
And I want you to realize
This is written by the son of the root cutter
And I just want you to see a couple
Couple things
Look at that second line
The light
Did you notice the light bringers were in there?
Did you notice Saba
Was in there?
Yeah, and
Oh, who men I want
Lord Hyman
Lord Hyman
What a fortunate
Marriage you make
In your
Archive, princely bed
Hyman, want ox Hyman
Give me the next one
Oh, God, can you see it?
Building up, remember
There are people who are getting married
There are people who are getting married
We give
The pirates
What they deserve
And from them
We take the booty
That's who we are
We follow
Do you understand?
We protect the virgin
Right?
What are you, savage?
What do you think all of our thoughts of the polis came from?
Did you think you knew the virgin
And now you do?
Good
Let's go to it
Let's, yeah, here
Oh, God, what does she want?
Oh, here we go
This is glory
What is she bringing in?
She's catching on fire, man
That's the false puros
That thing is a blaze
And she is catching stuff on fire
And she's giving that light
Oh, Hyman
Oh, Hecate
She is giving that
What is she really doing?
What is Cassandra doing?
Giving us here these proclamations
Coming from her sweet lips
Her sweet oracular
Legeic lips
What is she giving us?
She's giving us that purity
That purity
Of that
Bed
Huh, interesting
The purity, do you understand?
The democracy came from a cult
That protected
The purity
Of the virgin mother
Wait a minute
I'm getting confused
Shut up, Jesus
Where's your whip when you need it?
Let's go to the next one
Oh, you know what, I should insert here the comment
That I was going to talk about earlier
Somebody wrote in a comment
And said
You're a degenerate homosexual
And I just want you to know
That your
Interest
In my sexuality
Is irrelevant to this initiation
But it is duly noted
By everyone here
That you indeed have an interest
And it's okay
My mojo
Works
In all forms
All forms
You don't have to
Apologize
It's not your fault
If you were overcome
Ah, let's go on with the next quote
Oh my goodness
Look at this
For those of you who talked about
Drugs and what not, shame on you
Shame on you
Yeah
You know, clean up
You know, what's wrong
And I don't
Look, I'm not a martial arts expert
I don't know what kind of vibe I gave off
That people think I'm a martial arts expert
But I swear, somebody's going to walk up to me
Someday
And test that
And they're going to end up putting me on a concrete
Because look
That's not my style, I appreciate it
Good for you, I appreciate it
No
Let's go to much more nerdy pursuits
What is this? Oh my god
Look, Phoebus, bring Phoebus
Bring that ethereal chorus
Bring that Hosseos
That pure chorus
Did I tell you that we were going to the theater
And that theater is the place
Where they bring in the purification
Here it is, people
Loud and clear
From Euripides
What am I doing?
She's the priestess and she's there with her
Bay leaves, right? Her laurel
And she's there
Doing her job with the thue
What? Yes, doing her job
With the thumi amata
She is using those instances
She's fumigating
So that she can be in that
Aracular state
Why? Look what she yells out
Hymen
Hymen, three times
Hymen
And then she tells her mother to dance
Dance
Bring the joy
Right?
What does she want?
What does she want? She wants
That shout
From Hymen
She wants that shout
In that sacred song
That recognition
That understanding
Of beauty
She wants that
That is
Elysium
This is the reason
That every mystery religion
In the world
Including Christianity
Is based upon and centered around
A union
A union
What do you think all the drugs
And sex and cult were for?
It's a reflection
Right through that
Black hole
Didn't you notice we've been passing through a black hole
It's the only way you can get
These ghosts to do anything
Let's go
Let's go Eustathias, you still there?
I'm going to spare the whip tonight
On Eustathias, let's go
Next one
And who else do we want to come?
We want Phoebus to come
We want Phoebus Apollo to come
I just want to point that out
Chewie, can you bring up
Did we bring Phoebus along?
Oh my god
Apologies to the leader
Of the muses
Oh my god
That's what you expect
To get with Bacchus
There we go
That's what you expect to get from a Bacchus
One third time polar switch
Love it
Oh god, did you know the math
That they do is practically
You know
Well, it's way beyond
Let's keep going
We've got a couple more
I want to provide you with a couple of quotes
Here, look
What do people say about Jesus?
You can't
You can't leave Jesus alone
No
Right now that he's in our custody
Because we all know he's in Leicester
He's going to get it constantly
Here Jesus, have a little more
This is a segment
Whip for Jesus
Tell me Jesus
What's he going to tell me?
Tell me Jesus
Oh
Your flash gets so pink
And rosy when I smack it
Stop
You like that too much, don't you?
Tell me something
What did people say about you?
They said what?
You said you were a demoniac
And that you look at that last word
Minotai
All of my students
Will recognize
What is he doing?
He is mantic
He is entering
That ecstasy
Jesus was in profit
Because he was smart
About current events and history
No
He was at mantic because he was out
Of his mind
The only way he got there was with drugs
Through this cult
Through these pirates
Performing this mystery
And that's why
He said
I am not
One of them
Fantastic
They crucified him with two others
They caught two
Right
Had him there
Right
Okay
What do you think Athena did to clean up everything?
Come on
Technology of the Venoms
Technology of the Venoms
Oh
God
These are curatives
Crazy body changing
Curatives
How do you think
Achilles got to where he got?
Yeah
Let's go to the next one
I think I just heard snappy
Fall off his chair
Okay, are you ready?
Are you ready?
The one whom Jesus loved
Right? Hey, this is in the present
The one who Jesus loves is
And for those of you
What is that?
C.S. Lewis
C.S. Lewis
C.S. Lewis
Oh, I gagged him
C.S. Lewis
C.S. Lewis
Would be able to tell you
Hey, guess what?
This is the kind of love that existed
Between Achilles and
Patroclus
Yeah
Stop
We're in a camp
You know they're pirates
We have to be able to see this
To be able to bring back the polis
Right? And bring back the
Athana
Love it
Hear how I drop to Doric
From that Athenian A to an O
Love it
Let's go to the next one
I got a little bit more information for everybody
Is this the last?
And Jesus, no?
No, okay
Look at the word laystace
It's sitting there
Right on the second line
He's saying
What you come out here for
Oh, you're big weapons
You're Machaeron and you're
Solon
What are they?
Swords and
Warhammers
For lack of a better term
Oh, God
Because you're a pirate
You don't do this half
You know, half whatever
Baked
It has to be real, man
Okay
Go to the next one
What about these laystaces?
One more
Okay, now Ezekius goes on
To talk a little bit
This isn't Ezekius, this is Dyschordes
But Ezekius goes on
I want you to hear this
He goes on to talk about
The Greeks themselves
From the earliest time
Those who were Palaeo
These are the people being influenced
Most heavily by the Pulaskeans
He says
These people
These Greeks
These ethnic Greeks
What we can comfortably call
Greeks
Because of their language
He said these people
They start out in their entire society
Eporizos
It does what? It arises
From what?
Lestea
Piracy
You mean
That the earliest history
Those Bronze Age Greeks
Those people
Were pirates
Trafficking and people
Did Herodotus tell you?
Didn't he tell you?
It all starts with
The abduction of Medea
And then there's
Everyone else
Europa
Ryan Ayo
People getting taken
From places
Being traded by those
Who use the purple
Yeah
You know what Achilles does
As a pirate
He takes booty
He takes booty
His daddy's name is
Booty Taker
Yeah
And he goes into a place
And he takes, who does he take
Who
Is the booty
That Achilles is interested in
Taking
Turns out
Priestess
Priestess of Apollo
Priestess of the leader of the Muse
The Musagites
He's got a special name
Right
The Musagites
How do you get
To him within this cult?
You gotta go through
She who is the pirate
Athena
Yeah
That pirate queen
The virgin
She's a virgin mother
And from her
Will come
The one who is half serpent
Half mortal
Oh god
Oh god
And what will that give us?
Democracy
That's your history
That is your history
And Jesus Christ
Is caught up
Right
In the middle
And he is screaming
Because he doesn't want to end up
On that Roman cross
With other
Pirates
Yeah
Call Johnny Depp
This is different
Yeah
Yeah
These are the people that built our civilization
Now my question to you is
Which side do you want to be on?
Do you want to purify the polis?
Yeah
Then you're gonna have to go with Athena
And she will get you there
Through the purifications
That Bacchus
Who is that
Power of the mania
That all power
That pan
Yeah
He can bring it
Ooh, do you see him
Dressed as a priestess?
That Achilles
That has the reputation
Of being the fiercest
Of the fighters
Do you know who he was taught?
How to fight by?
He was taught
By a group of priestesses
One of which
Was a woman
Who mastered the use of drugs
That control
Aging
Welcome back
To Lady Babylon
Thank you for coming tonight
For anyone
Who was gonna get mentioned that didn't
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I want all of
The things that are being produced
I want to bring you these videos
And I'm gonna do it over time
But I want our contributions
To be a permanent
To be a permanent
And continuous
Aspect of what's going on here
So
Watch the goat video
Thank you for coming tonight
I appreciate it
Classical wisdom
We'll have a little bit there
Maybe some new things
So people won't be like, bring up new things
Yes
Always fresh
Always fresh because
We're not there yet
We gotta get deep
And watch the things
Arise, watch them come about
Yeah
Awesome, thank you for coming tonight
I know that it was
Tantalizing
To walk among ancient pirates
We got to see some of the
Sexiness
Of actual history
And you got to find out
That you have inherited a world
The benefit
For any period of time
Of democracy
If you have had that benefit at all
You owe it
To
Athena the pirate
She's the one
Who establishes justice
Thank you for coming tonight
Hail Satan
Pharmakea
Medea
Twinkle in your eye
The snake venom
Make some zombie like
