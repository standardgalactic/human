I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin', keepin' from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should've said
So it's askin' too much for you all to believe
Never knew what I said, never meant nobody knew what I said
Never was a cause for a long, never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Season 3!
We have another crack!
It's seven weeks!
Yes, yes, beautiful!
I love it!
It's great to be back!
Had a great working vacation!
It was given our work, and we have a great show for you tonight
All I'm going to do is bring out in front of you the words from antiquity
And we're going back to Lady Babylon
But this time, it's Lady Babylon Rome
Oh, that's fantastic!
I'm going to bring up a series of text tweets tonight
And what we're doing is we're setting our sights to the West
We've been to the crime scene, we've seen Jesus arrested with the naked boy at 4 a.m.
We know that he was calling himself a sex trafficker
We know there are drugs involved
We're looking for the cult
We're trying to dive as deep into it as we can possibly get
Why not go to the founder of all this mystery?
Yes, why not go to the founder herself?
And that's what we're going to do tonight
So we're jumping out of the East, in the West
To the dropping off of the sun
And the arrival of night
This is gorgeous, this is gorgeous
Who do we bring? Who do we summon tonight?
Oh, we're bringing a North African
Oh, I forgot to make an announcement
For the chat people, people that jump on there
Yeah, be cool, be cool
Or get zapped, be cool or get zapped
That's the place to come
So don't bring any of that racism, misogyny
Whatever your values are, we don't care
We don't
Leave that stuff outside
Or Cersei, was that you?
Cersei, please, jump on
We need this, right?
Human sacrifice, love it, it's delicious
So we're going to the West
And we're going to North Africa
And we're going to dredge out of the soil
From late 5th century
A very special lawyer
This lawyer was, boy did he have the sources
Well educated, his was that Latin
Yeah, anyway, and what he did was he preserved for us
Some of the most culty references possible
This is the, he has preserved the actual
Functioning of the mystery
Many of you will say mystery, mystery
Look, it's all on YouTube and we're all figuring out
Mystery, mystery, mystery, right?
And where's it from? Oh, it's from the secret
And, right, and okay, we're coming away
We're stepping away from that crowd
That wants to take us in the back, right?
We're remembering that, it's good technique
This season, right?
We're going to practice that
We're stepping out, we're going to say, okay
Just let us look at the cult
Tonight I just want you to see the cult
Through Lady Babylon, right?
Scholars with their books
And their selling and their position
Trying to give you their theories
That's not for us, we just were detectives
We want to know what was the reality going on
And so in order to get there tonight
We're going to start our
Johnson to Rome with Dracontius
Dracontius, don't you love that?
It means a Draco, right?
It means the dragon
Anyway, he was preserved
He preserved for us the strains of cult
In an epilion, an epilion
And what dare you ask is an epilion
It's a short epic, okay
It's a metrically an epic, it's short
And yeah, he wrote one
He wrote one
He did some time in prison too
There were wars going on
Between Christian and non-Christian
And it was going against, it was terrible
A disturbing time, disturbing times
I can smell it, can you smell it?
Okay, let's pull out some Dracontius
Let's get serious, pull out some Dracontius
And tonight I want you, you're sitting on that throne
As you are within Asterian
I want you to go ahead and look at these images
We're looking at images, we're going to be working with the words
But we're looking at the images
Okay, number one text, please
I just want you to see, I'm going to sit here as the voice
And I'm going to try not to yell here
I don't want to yell, so why don't I do this?
Yeah, what we've got here is that gold and artifact
It's protected by a dragon
Yes, and on that skin
And what's funny, the word for parchment is used
So it is implied that there is writing
That that song that is being serwata
That that song is what that guardian is guarding
It's what that dragon is watching
Yes, but look what we get here
And the third line, hank propter pelagi, temerator primus yasson
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice? Look at this
The first yasson was a rapist of the burning purple
Isn't that nice?
And so I want you to see that we're right there
Right from the beginning
So he's gotten us to the place
And he's letting us know
And I want you to get prepared for all the snakes
And for all the, we want to see the right
As it's being performed
We want to go there directly, right?
So, okay, we're just settling in
Give us another one
Another
Yeah, ut sitha conspexit kraim
Isn't this wonderful?
Look at the second word, sitha
That's her, right?
He's describing what Medea is doing
And he says she is sitha
Those of you who are lovers of that history
And I know those of you who are here
Just notice, just sit back
Those of you who said sithians, sithians
Who said sithians?
Please don't
Sithians, what about these people?
Yeah, well her name is sitha
Gorgeous, same text again, please, Chewie
She's amazed, right?
She's amazed at this process that's going on
Next one, please
Yeah, Aurora
Notice the name Aurora, rutilans
Kapilos pectinat
She's calming
Her red or glistening red rutilans is like
I don't know, it's a description of the glowing
That you have, oh yes here, we'll do this
A description of the glowing that you have
When Aurora appears, it's a sheen from her hair
And it is rutilans, oh isn't that nice?
Her hair is punikeos, punikeos, gorgeous
Gorgeous, could you give us back that text Chewie?
Thank you, yeah
And what is she doing as she calms her hair?
She's blowing out, she's pouring out
Dawn, eos, look at that last word, eom
Yeah, there's a diagramma in that
We're going to see this, that diagramma
Most people, go ahead and bring me up
Most people think that the diagramma
From the Mycenaean Greek that's going back to about
1600 BC
Yeah, that Mycenaean Greek is carrying that diagramma
But people refer to that as the origin
And that the Romans, across the Adriatic
They really picked up through the Etruscans
This association with the diagramma
There's a Pulaskian note in this
In the Pulaskian culture, we're talking about older
Older, do we have that map there?
You can show some people with references
We'll get there, we'll get there in the sources
Here we go, look, oh this is trippy
What's going on?
Look right here, that's fine, look
Here I am, above the world
And look at all of the places that they have gone
Look at the Pulaskian culture, these are all references
So you've got them heavy, we also have them here
We also have them right here, oh that's nice
Lesbos, they call the island of Lesbos
Pulaskias, isn't that nice?
The land of the Pulaskians
And this is the same thing we're getting
In Northern Italy through the Etruscans
The Tyranoi, the Etruscans didn't call themselves Etruscans
Man, that's never how it works out historically
That's what somebody else called them
The Tyranoi or the Tirsanoi
Have a Pulaskian root
So this is an older culture that's Bronze Age
Bronze Age, when you're thinking Mycenaean
You're thinking getting into the Middle Late Bronze Age
Getting into the Late Bronze Age
Boom, you got this explosion of this mystery
So this is really going back to the origin
Yeah, even the sea, remember the sea
We're going to see the sea in a minute
And we're going to see it through the purple
This is, oh my, this stuff is okay
Bunker's your steep bouncer
Go outside and talk to the wind for a minute
But yeah, buckle in, this is going to be good
Okay, let's get another reference up
Fantastic, yeah, oh, this is Juno
Yes, asking Cyprus for help
And she says send that boy love
What is he, he's carrying a quiver
Right, my Cyprus, yeah
And let that weirago
See that last word on the second line
That weirago is, that's Eve that we saw before
That's how we translate Eve in the oldest
Of the Latin versions, right
And so yes, the only one that works
That means lead from man, right
Like the text says, it's the only one
But that weirago is that old Etruscan manerva
It's that some people would translate it virgin
But what is she, she's furibunda
That's a special word used in cult
And that means she who carries the daimon
That's the inspired one, okay
So we're talking about a weirago
Which is a, typically described as a manly girl
As a manly girl, yeah
As a girl who is not yet developed
Yeah, sexually but is developed muscular wise
Yeah, and you know gymnasts
Kind of a weirago is somebody that
You know, you go into battle with
Or that you hunt with
That's what a weirago is, right
A lion huntress, Cyreni is that weirago
Okay, I think it's a beautiful portrait
Because what we're doing is we're assembling a portrait
Of Lady Babylon, go ahead
That same, yeah, yeah, right
So let her fall by that fire
That fire of yours that burns
Let the furor teach us to love
Because that's what she has
Madea has that furor, right
And then a little bit he talks about
Let her just walk away from the shrines of the goddess
What goddess? The goddess Diana
carries the quiver, right
She's trying to take control of this
What is she?
Well, so far we know she is an oracle
All right, remember she's one of the captives
One of the, we just read the first Yasun
So right, you think the name Jason is the dude's name
No, it's a title within a cult, right
The first one of these abducted her
The burning purple
Isn't that cool? Isn't that cool?
That's amazing, yeah
Through a series of kings we go
Right, loving it, loving it
Okay, give us more text, man
What's there about Madea, please
Oh, okay, now this is, I'm just going to go through
I'm going to fly through this
And I just want to set a picture for you
Yeah, so I'm going to start translating now
It pains my soul to tell you
Of the abominations of the black virgin
It pains my soul to show God's taken captive
To show the manipulation of elements
To show nature given to serve a girl
The word there is Puella that he's using
Remember, she is in this state of not yet having finished puberty
Yeah, very tall
Yeah, very tall
But with the appearance, with the gynomorphic appearance
Right, the androgenic appearance
Of approximately a 12-year-old
Thanks to the Babylonians
They were the ones who figured that out
And there she is in that year
Preserved with those serpents
Yeah, oh, this is good stuff
This is cult right here
Is it me or did we just land in a giant...
I mean, we just showed up and here everybody's got the robes
And you know, here they come
This is gorgeous, bring us up another one
The same text please, same text
Yeah, so what does she say?
What does she say? She says
I am able, right?
This is what she says
But the poet is saying
It really shouldn't be done
I shouldn't be saying this
Anyway, so I hate to show you the nephos
The terrible things that she does
Turning, you know, God's captive
And controlling nature itself, right?
What else does she do?
She brings the stars of the pole
That is the pole stars
And for those of you who are reading
The PGM, the Papyrus Grachai Magikai
Tune up
Okay, here are your pole lords
Kai et foibi cursus
And the course of Phoebus
And the stars of the chylem
Of the heaven, right?
What does she do?
She moves these by her own arbitrio
By her own will, right?
The will mulietis
The will of the wife
Which Dracontius is real, real, real strict
About saying, look, in your trancy
You have Hera, Aphrodite, and Minerva
And don't forget it, right?
So you're going to see each of these three
Coming out in this, okay?
This is all framed, of course, within the
Oracular cult, right?
So I've got the cursus foibi
Okay, good, okay
Because, line six, because what she orders, right?
That nephos that she orders, right?
That's what happens when she commands the ether
To send out the flames
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
You've heard this convention from antiquity
You've heard about this convention
It's called drawing down the fire
Yeah, or the fire of Uranus
Yes, and it's a special thing
It's a special production
That the only a maga would understand how to do
Only someone with the purple would understand how to do
It's the breathing of the fire, they would say
The breathing of the fire
And people wanted to see her
Gorgeous, bring that up one more time
That big text one more time, please, thank you
Yeah
Her voice
Shots through the air
And makes the living and the dead
When she herself turns back fate
To a course that she would want
She is the one who is given the sacrifice of the stranger
She runs through the temples of Scythian Diana
We are steadfastly in the Crimea
Yes, gorgeous
Look at line 11
She possesses the star-bearing heaven
In her abominable breast
And she presses the gods with her prayers
This mirago to do what is unwilling that she wants
Love it
She sings songs in different languages
And burns in appearance
She says names, the names
And these things, it is indecent for a poet to learn
We will sing
Like Paul Hymnia, the mother of Orpheus
Right?
This is the work of Paul Hymnia, the mother of Orpheus
Yes, nice, nice, love it
Okay, so let's look at her and see what kind of person Lady Babylon is
I'm going to go a little bit over, so just hang in there
It's a little bit long, I'm sorry, and I thank you for your time
Chewie, hit the next quote, please
Yes, this is now Venus, right?
We're all here gathered, waiting for the morning star, right?
So this is Venus, and she says, my child is here
He's sprinkling the air with many types of flowers
He breathes out an ambrosial odor, right?
Odor, that's what happens when Arrel shows up, right?
When a morse shows up, he suddenly can smell the ambrosia
You know, that spring ambrosia
Okay, and while she was talking, the civius Venus was talking
Her son came and hovered over her gremium
What's that? It's a lap, it's a lap
Anhelans, do you know what love does?
Love sits over the lap of Aphrodite
Breathing the vapor
Breathing that vapor
I'm talking to you about a deep, deep mystery
Yeah, let's keep hunting here, love it, keep going
We've got a few more, next please
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Who is this Eros, Pirouis?
Oh yes, that just means the flaming one, right?
The flaming one, right? What is he?
He is that men's Ignea Mundi
That burning mind of the cosmos, right?
Yes, Atkwe Wapur
He is that vapor, polly of the pole
What kind of vapor? That one that produces that second vapor
He is the continuance of things, the succession, right?
He is the affection, he is nature, he is type
He is the source, the fountain, the author, the beginning
You, you great Amur are the generative health
Yes, you are that Woloptas
You are that pleasant thing to be desired
You are the Princaps, and for those of you who don't recognize him
He is the Princaps Pietatis
The prince of religious piety
Yes, yes
Another one, please
Yep, so here we are
Who is this Medea?
Look at line 136
And look at the last two words
Yep, Medea Sacerdos
First word on the next line, Sacrilega
Medea is the sacrilegious priest
Yeah, think about that for a minute
She is the one who brings the abomination
The anti-religious religion
That is the oracular
It is the base of the oracular
Tonight's subtitle was Why Must Christians Lie?
They must lie because they must find a way out of themselves
Yes, yes, bring it up
We've been all talking about the truth
And who is lying to us?
Lies, lies, lies
Yes, yes, right
Bring us the oracle
She won't lie to us
She has no reason to
Okay, the dude, I'm sorry
But your dude was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy
Yelling about child predating
Okay
Another source, let's do this
Yeah, so this is who Juno is seeking, right?
This eunim pelascom
She wants there to be some choice
And some loving and some helping and some desiring
Some breathing in and out
With this eunim pelascom
This youth, this young man
This Pulaski and Prince
That's why she needs the medwa
That's why she needs her
Next one, please
I just want you to see that the pirates are showing up
I want you to see the pirates coming to this
But when I say pirates, forgive me
Grandmaster Depp
But when the pirates show up
We're talking about child traffickers is what we're talking about
We're in a different place
So when Jesus is yelling about himself being a buccaneer
He's not talking about the swashbuckling type
That you might want to have dinner with
He's talking about the type that are stealing children
For the sake of the sex trade
Which is not funny
For the sake of Jesus in that context
It kind of gives you an icky feeling
We have to be honest
We cannot cover anything up
Give us another Roman source
Speak, dragon
Bacchus, right?
Bacchus, why?
You need to know that when you're dealing with Medea
You're dealing with the Bacchic Coat
Yes, yes
During her existence as she walked around
She was called Diana
Right? It wasn't her
Being named after the god
It was her
She was the source
She was the source of dianic worship
She has the right to kill the stranger
It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous
We're going to get into the death and stuff
I'm telling you, the drugs, don't worry
The drugs will ground us
That's our salvation
These drugs will ground us
Because they're going to show up here in the text
In a minute, you're going to be like
A lot of people tell me that all the time
They're like, I didn't think you actually meant
Or I didn't think that there was actually support for this
I didn't think that you were actually right
It's not about theories
It's not about writing books
And keeping your position
And establishing a huha-bruha
It's about those texts
And about our integrity
And the translation of those texts
That's really what matters here
So, let's go back
Let's keep jumping in
See if we can go a little bit deeper
Thanks for your patience tonight
Next quote
Yes, okay
On the second line
Cognosco
How do you like that? It sounds like
A little more Barry White in there, maybe
Cognosco
I recognize
secreta polorum
That's Medea talking
She understands
The secrets
Or the hidden things
Of the polls
Do you know who she is?
Do you know those poll lords?
See Morbus at it
If there will be
Disease
If war
Is undertaken
If it rains
If it floods everything out
Or
If the sky
Is
Blazoned
With the horns
Of the
Red flames
Korusket in Latin is a great
Verb, it actually does
It's the image of horns
Driving through something
Love that
And look at the last
I mean this is the
Most hilarious thing I've seen
This bottom line here
So she's addressing
That first
You could say
Rapist
And not be wrong
Because he's a dude
On a boat
Who sails in a town
Abducts a woman
Anyway
Right
So look at what
Look at what the medwah has to do
Right
And he's just the first
He's just the first
The dude comes in
And he takes for the sake of sexual
Purposes
Yeah
He abducts
For the nymphizing
Of the virgin
Yeah
Yeah
Now it happened to be
And we're going to get into that with the dragons
That
Remember that Medea is
Involved at a very high level
Of
Late Bronze Age society
She's a queen
And eventually she ends up
With what
You could call as the
Origins of the
Opersian power
Yeah
Yeah, as a matter of fact we call
Meads
Because of her name
Yeah
Medea
The medewa
The dewana
Or the diwana
Yeah, nice
It's gorgeous. A lot more of it's coming
Through the Latin than you think
Everybody's been emphasizing
For the first two seasons
I've been giving you all Greek sources
Well
As any philologist and this is what separates
When you're out there shopping around
And somebody's telling you
This is the mysteries
Blah blah blah
Ask and they say Greek
Blah blah blah
You can test them
If they can't do
Ancient Latin sources
Good ancient Latin sources
Then
Don't believe me because their Greek wasn't
Gained through
The avenue of classical philology
Yeah
And every classical philologist
Takes for granted
That these two
Cultures
Produced languages
That interacted with each other
And
The real goodies
The real goodies
What's the difference between the
Greek, Coase
And
Somebody
From the Latin tradition
What's the difference
This kind of thing is important
More text
Somebody bring the text
Chewie, another text please
I just want you to see that
Magam, look at that last word
Right, that's her. She is a maga
She is a maga
So she is a queen
Right
She is royalty
And
We're building temples to her
We're building temples to her
On our side of the fence
On the western side of the fence
We call her
Isn't that nice
We're going to see that in a second
It means serpent
It means serpent
Yeah, gorgeous
Love it, Lady Babylon
Go ahead, another source
Oh, look at this
Here's our anquez
Here's our anquez
What are these serpents
What do they do
They webrant
They
Bring about
Vocally
Sibila
Violations, whisperings
Sub-weperes
Dintibus
Under their
Viper teeth
Under their viper teeth
These anguest
You know, a lot of Greeks
Bring it back up, because now I'm going to
Look, this is inevitable
You're going to get this
There's conflicts in antiquity, right
Linguistically, there's conflicts
And people will argue
There's a Greek word, Greek origin
And the other stuff, Romans would be like
No, no, no, this is a Latin word
Latin origin here
Most of the time, you can tell pretty easily
But sometimes they fight over the concepts
And
That's what you're going to see here
But bring up that text again
Same one, please
Dude
Dude
There we go, so that last word
Sorry, the last word
For your serpents
So, Angithia
We have a temple to her
And we know from our ancient
Authorities that that's what they called
Medea
In Italy
And there's temples to her
Anyway, look at the first word
Sibila
Yeah, you want to say
Are
Sibilations the same thing
The Sibil gives off
They say, no, no, it's not
It's Sibil is from
C plus
Bule
C plus Bule, the Greek Bule
Which means council and C
Is the Tyranian
Or Etruscan
For those gods
Thank you, John
So
Is there an Etruscan connection there
With Sibule
Perhaps
These whisperings
These Sibilations
Are
Associated with
Oracular cult
The Sibil
Who is that serpent
I mean, they're calling her for Frick's sake
Pythia
Medea
Is the one that started this
If you don't believe me
Ask Pindar
Who provides her
In a fourth Pythian ode
He provides her prophecy
That came from her mouth
When she was on the island of
Thera
It was preserved
By
The Pythian
Priestess
That was
Wrapped up in what
Pindar was
Describing
So anyway, good stuff
Let's get, come on
We're almost through
Lucifer's there, fantastic
Fantastic
There we are, Lucifer
Very important
Aurora, that's why you saw Aurora before
Because you know what family
We're in the family
Of the Donbringers
These are the Donbringers
Oh, look at this
Okay, now
For those of you who think you're so smarty smart
Here is something
Out of her lips
Right, so we're within the cult
We're looking at an imprecation
Right, that's coming from her
It's coming from the source
Of the burning purple
She says
Aus
Grandfather
Son
Witness
Yeah, son is an S-U-N
Right, soul
And for those of you who don't smell
Rome yet, you should start to now
Because the worship of soul
Is very important
This is her
Aus
Her grandfather
So
Perseche Mithra
Oh, do you like that?
Do you like that?
Perse's a Mithras
Oh, that's lovely
If you don't love that, you're in a bad place
Guess where
This is coming from
Guess where Mithra
Or Mithra is coming from
It's coming from the Donbringers
Right
Echus noctis
Moon
That beauty of night
Furia
The furies, wait a minute
Yes, Medea, who is
The priestess
Of
The right to murder
The stranger
She's that priestess
And she
Is invoking
Her grandfather
Mithras
Beautiful
And we have the furies
Right, because this is the
Abominable
Right
We thought it was over
But when you stand before those gates
It turns out
The universe strains you
Proserpina
And Pluton
Uh oh, this is a death cult
This is an underworld death cult
Yeah, you're right
That's why it's wrong for the poet
To know this
It's wrong for the poet to profane
What how is Medea described
As the profaning
Priestess
Are you beginning to see
Lady Babylon
Akipe so radians animus
Yeah, receive
The souls
Radiating sun
You
The bodies, Lona
The nutriment of the soul
Lovely
At the very last, the line
Look at the last word, this is a gorgeous word
Umbras
Umbras
Umbras
It means shades
Shades
Those shades
Of those who came before us
Right
The leader
Of night
Will bring
Those forward
The death
The dead shall rise again
Can we get a little less of the background
I hope that background's not creeping in
Let me know in the chat
Taking a background
Fantastic
One more, let's get another one
Please
I just want you to see Moses is here
Moses
Right
But here he is
We dug up Moses tonight
And don't be surprised
You saw the snake thing
You saw the fact that he made a little
Tent
Where you could walk into it
And pass out, you could hear the voice
Of Jehovah
You heard that, right?
He's the muse, baby
By the way, this is
Pretty contemporary stuff
You know what I mean?
Moses, it turns out
Was one of the earliest
Corruptions
Of Medea's
Mystery
Yes, Moses, isn't that neat?
Jesus came later
Another corruption
Of the right
And for those of you
Who need it more directly
Judaism and Christianity
Are both the offspring
Of pagan mystery
A thousand years before
Either of them had anybody
On the scene in diapers
Yes, this is wonderful
Let's go, another one
Yes, she has a chariot
Right, she has a chariot
And
These dragons
Right?
They offer up to her
They give her their necks
Yes, these dragons
Who carry her song
It was dragons that showed up
The night that she burned
Let's turn the
We're going to
We only have like two quotes left
So we'll get to those, but I want you to know
The night, I'm going along, I'm sorry
The night that she burned
Right, so get this in your head
She is a queen
In
Exile
And
She is
She
One night, she burns
The princess
And
Her father to death in a wedding
That was with the
Yasun Premis
First
First Jason, and for those of you
Haven't made a connection yet
To Jesus, it's the same name
It's not Hebrew
It's the same
Name
In Greek
Yasun is a title
Within mystery cult
Just like
Christos
Yeah, that's
Interesting, so this guy
He got arrested in a public park
Called Gethsemane
At 4am with a naked boy
And was calling himself
A child trafficker
He was using a title
Within a mystery cult
That had to do with the transmission
Within the blood
Of the new life
Yeah
Yeah, the mystery is not a question
It's an operation
It's a performance
Yeah
And we know
That's why that naked kid was with him
There were snakes and stuff
Bring up the snakes
Let's get to this last
For those of you who doubt
That our snakes are so important here
Even after we dredged up old Moses
And forced him
To lift up his staff
With his snake on it
And this thing into a snake
You know what I mean?
Gorgeous
Even after that, if you don't believe me
I'm telling you
They're working on this medically
With dotes and antidotes
And let's look at some
Why the snakes? Why the snakes?
People are going to, you watch
Within a period of time
People will catch on to this
In classics and history
And they'll say, what about the
Dogs? Right?
It's just the way I started spouting this
Years ago
Trying to get people's attention
But nobody reads these tags
Drakontius
Who reads Drakontius?
Nobody, like bring him back up
Come here, buddy
Get up here
Bring him
Another Drakontius
Yeah
Medicamina serpens
Weeper a seipe
You what?
Weeper a seipe
You hear a little bit of the
This is a couplet, right?
Elegiac couplet
It's got a line of hexameter
And a line of pentameter
It loses a foot
Somewhere in the middle
Anyway, you can hear a little bit
Of it there
Well, no rhymes
Because we don't rhyme
It's more sophisticated
It's meter
Anyway
Let's translate this
Right?
So your ass can kill you
Right?
But your snakes also are
Medicines, right?
They also have medicines, this says
Your vipers
Often time help
And often time
They kill
They kill
Look at this
Here is the
Oh, yeah, I can feel that glow
Can you feel that glow?
It's like around his midsection
It's like a bottom glow
We'll call it
Yes, right?
No offense, Mithras
Sorry about that
Yeah, no, I forgot where I was
Look what happened
I'm lost
Here we are, the vipers can help
And they can kill
Right? So this whole idea
Of this balance between
The dote and the antidote
Don't think that it's not there
It's the central heart
Of the mystery
Is there one more? Give me one more
Quote here, I'm sorry
This is going to wrap it all
I'll try to talk again, kind of more
Mysteriously
Isn't that nice?
Concula
Yeah, that shell
That little creature
Brings us the delights
And the death
From that
Deep, deep wave
Yeah, she brings forth
The
True riches
Of the burning purple
Palagi
In that second line of the couplet
Palagi
Is a word that you can use
To represent the sea
Or specifically
The sea mollusk
That gives us the purple
That is our
Phoenix
Our Phoenician power
Yes, you should see it
And that's why that Phoenician princess
What is her name?
She's royalty
She's the priestess of a start
Right?
I think you call her Jezebel
Jezebel
Love it
Love it
Lady Babylon, what does she have
On her forehead?
She has one name
She of a thousand names
Has one name
Mystery
Her
Historically, she started it
It was only
It was only accessible
Through her
Is that
Is that our final
That's our final quote, right? Good
I also, there's a lot
From Dracontius
Over the next
Six
Weeks
We're going to
Focus on the Roman side
We're going to focus
On
This being the first week
For the next six times
That we meet, we're going to focus on that
Burning purple
And upon finding it
And looking at
The right
As the exercise
Generating the oracle
So Lady Babylon
Can
Be made
Visible
That's what they call it
Making the invisible visible
Yes, it's
Gorgeous
And I will be bringing out
Little bits of Dracontius here and there
That are at the point that I think
That would be most appropriate
But I do have a game plan
For this third season
And
We will be jumping
Into some rich, rich
Waters that you're not going to get
If you want to sit around and listen to people's theories
Right? We don't need
Theories, right?
We don't need to sell books, we're not selling books
Brother, right?
I think what I'm going to do
Is invite
Quick here for the last
10 minutes to invite
Snappy and
Rob, do we have Rob here as well?
Why don't we
Start with Snappy and Snappy
Tell me
Your reflections
Tonight on what
Dracontius
I'm completely blown away
It's absolutely
Amazing
It connects all the dots
And it shows that this tradition has survived
Well into the Roman times
It's everything you've been talking about
I'm still
Processing, I need some time
Awesome, awesome
Rob, what's your
By the way, Snappy
You're going to have to defend your title
Because you and Thonius are kind of co-champs
Next Friday
We'll have a fight night
A fight club
And I'm looking forward to it
So we're going to do it
Anyway, next Friday
Rob, what's your impression?
Any impression
Or thoughts
On Dracontius?
Why are you kidding?
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, I feel sick
That was a big meal
A lot of courses that was
It's everything I want today
It's
Beyond
It's just
It's wrote all this in poetry
Is this all in poetry?
I'm tying up so many ends here
I mean, you've got jazzabal
Jazzabal for me
It's an aim, it's like
Where's the prince?
Where's the prince?
And then you bring in the prince
Princaps
And that's Caesar
And I'm connecting just
I can't
I can't get over it, to be honest with you
This is
One source
Who's bought us
It's just unbelievable
Is
Where can you get this?
I want to read all this
Where can you get it?
It's just amazing
Yeah, you know
That's a good question
Rob, where can you get this?
And how was he writing this?
Is it poetry?
Is it this?
Yes, it's verse
And it's in the
Verse that is used
By the
Oracular cults
It is the Dactylic Hexameter
And
So when of course
Whenonus, who's writing
His great epic of Dionysus
He's going to use the same
Way of poetry
The same melody
Right, the same marching
Order
That the priestesses
Who are performing
These rites that they're using
Right, so
There's a level of authenticity
Of what Drakontius is doing
And honestly, some of the vocabulary
That he uses is just
It's incredible
You can see the influence
Of the Etruscan
Right there
Out in the open
And the richness of this
Early Bronze Age cult
Which
If you can get just a glimpse of it
You're in good shape
But that's what the language does
It brings us that
Let me ask Snappy
How is your
Project
Of interviewing
Going?
I notice that you're getting
More focused
What are your interviews going to start
What do you want to focus on?
Right now
I'm focusing on interviewing
People who have been connected to this
And I've been enjoying the conversations here
Tomorrow I'm going to be talking
With Nick Cathonius
Who is the joint fight club winner
That should be good tomorrow night
But really what I focus on
Is magical practice
And how we
Utilize these
Mysteries and what you've been showing us
And what we've been doing here
There's been so much discussion about things
Like the sortace and necromancy
I really want to explore those topics in depth
And I want to have
Additional speakers who know about that
History come on as well
Ah, see how
That sounds good
See, that's alluring
Oh, yeah, fantastic
Rob, what are you doing
For the world, Rob?
Leaning Greek at the minute
That's where my focus has been
But
We need somewhere where we can
Go and meet
And we're kind of restricted at the
Many, so I'm not going to go into details
But coming Wednesday
I think we might have
Well, we will have a solution
There'll be another discord
Going live on Wednesday
And I'll give the address out
And I'll all be
Prepared and ready for it
But
It's rather focusing on these episodes
This episode is like
The epitome of what
This discord
Will be about
The sources and discussing
What's in them
And what's in the episodes
Strictly the episodes, that's all I'm
Reliable
That kind of
Let me ask you this question
Let me interrupt and ask you this question
I'm trying not to interrupt
And I'm trying not to scream
Into my mic anymore
These are things that we notice
As we're watching the former season
So I'm going to try to
Be more professional this way
Rob, you're
Just tell the group
You were not a class
You didn't study
This when you were young
You're coming at this new
And yet you're
Diving into the language
I'm going to make you dive into the
Latin now
Which is great, because I get to spank
Everywhere
I love it
But tell the group
What that means to you
It's something to come back
In the middle of your life
Totally new like this
But you see that there's a reason for it
Tell us
What motivates you
It's
It's compiled
Every day
Each and every day
By
This morning
I woke up and I've come down
And I've made sure I can remember
All the declensions for the nouns
And I want to write it all out
But where that comes from
Is
It's just
A fascination
Where I'm coming from
And
Going into something
Through you that is
It's just compiling
Fascinating and drives
Each and every day at the minute
And
It's only increasing because
You're saying now
Latin is going to come
To the front and
Keeping up with everything
Is hard work
It's hard work but
I can't come away from it
There's no coming away from it
That episode is just
So many
Ends up for
I knew it would be good
I knew that episode would be good
I hope people go back and watch it
Because there's so much in it
And draw out what
Is in it because
It's pretty damn
Conclusive
The path of the arc
You've just took it on
Has taken us to
And it covers all the research I've been doing
For the past two years
And
It's coming from a Latin
A Latin source
And he's giving you the diagram
Which is the indication
He's showing you where this is
Originating through the language
And that to me is
Is magic
Well we've got to get
Sweaty and in the pit
With the
With the Romans
We've got to get naked in the pit
With those Mithraic
Officers
In there
I love this
And there is
So much that I want to
Share with you
That
Is
That allows us to build that scene
Better so that we can just see
What's the frickin' reality
We're not here to start cults
Somebody was asking me
About
What kind of people
Are you doing
Do you want participating
I want all kinds of people
I don't care what you are
You know
I don't care what your
Religion is
I don't care what group you're in
I don't care where you go hang out
Where jackets
I don't care about that stuff
None of that stuff is important
In here we preserve the integrity
Of the muse
And we work with those texts
If that can help you
To break into the reality
That look Jesus Christ
Was a dude who got arrested
By the legitimate authorities
In a public park with a naked
Kid
Calling himself a sex
Pirate
Okay
What happened in that picture
There's a reason to this
It's not the fairy tale
That's what I want
And I'll end with this
Asking snappy
Are we breaking through
To the reality
Is this productive
Or
I'm giving you the last word
Yeah
It's beyond productive
I don't understand how people
Can't see these things
We have these titles
We have these positions
We miss it now
When we see what Yasin is doing
Right
And then you look at all of these other characters
It's almost like laid bare
And why this is so important
Is because there's been a cover up
There's been an orchestrated effort
To remove this kind of magical connotation
And to whitewash and sanitize
Jesus
And everything he's about
No, we can't allow that
You know
I could not say that
Better
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
