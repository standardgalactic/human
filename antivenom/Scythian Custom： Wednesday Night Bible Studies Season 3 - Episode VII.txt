I never meant anything I said Just spittin' up everything I've been fittin'
Keepin' from eatin' away at me Never said anything I meant
I never said the letters that I should've said But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows When I say, never was a cost for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon! This is the season 3 finale
And we're gonna have a Bible study tonight
I'm going to bring you two passages
These two passages will be about Scythian women and their most potent drug
I want to bring you two passages tonight
And the first one that we're gonna look at is from Hippocrates
The second is from a guy named Gaius Valerius Flakus
Which you are a little bit familiar with by now because we've used him a couple of times
But we want to show everyone, we want to tell the kiddies and we want to show everyone the right
Everybody's looking for the right, they want to know the right
So tonight we're at a place where we're going to again set that ship for that late Bronze Age right
Mystery, religion right, and we're gonna step out of that ship
We're gonna try to see through a couple of these ancient authors
We're gonna see what's actually going on
Tonight's theme is a woman that we have yet to see
I've got a little subliminal messaging here packaged that we need to show you first
As usual, just to kind of warm up, to get our juices flowing, chewy, light speed
Music
Music
Music
Music
So we start tonight at a place that's a little bit behind where the historians like to start
They like to start in the Iron Age for some reason
They think the city is just, I don't know, maybe they were deposited here by someone
They're part of these tribes that are moving and mobile populations
And they've got branches throughout different parts of the Mediterranean, Asia Minor, and the Ionian coast
Yes, oh god, we're gonna love this stuff
These are beautiful, let's go to them right away
Let's run to our first source, our first source tonight
And by the way, for those of you who are following with the right, just keep your hands in the car at all times
Let's do this, bring up Hippocrates
I summon Hippocrates
Yes, come here you old fool
This is from the Hippocratic Corpus
I've been working with my students with this text this week, my Greek students
Because it is Ionian Greek
It is Ionian Greek and it's good for them to get exposed to something that's not quite attic
You know what I mean, get some of that good Homeric
You can't be talking about dialects with me unless you've been there
You know what I mean, I love it
This is Ionian, this is the scientific Greek
This is what all the Hippocratic stuff is in
You love it, you're gonna get these Ionian philosophers along the coast
There was modern-day Turkey, right?
Oh, can you smell it? I love this stuff
Okay, throw up that Greek there, let's look at this little bit
There was this Scythian group, the Scythian clan
Yeah, in Europe, right?
Which lives Oike, listen to the attic is Oike
The Ionian is Oike
Isn't that nice? It's a nice little dialectical difference
They're around Lake Miotis, which is the Sea of Azov, right?
Excellent, excellent, we showed that
Subliminally, you should have it programmed
We got there to that place, we found it, we landed
Thanks, Chewie, you can land now, that's fantastic
Alright, and these people were different, says Hippocrates
Or the Hippocratic Corpus, whoever it was that wrote this
They differed from the other nations, they're called Sauromacians
The Sauromatai, the Sauromatai they're called
And the women of these people, again a little bit of Ionian Greek here
Not the Attic Tuton, but the Ionian Tutteon
You like that? They throw in a little extra, a little extra vow
Then get assimilated of that, of these people
What do the women do? He says the Hippodzontai, they ride horses
And they talk Seusi, talk Seusi
They shoot arrows, poison arrows, okay
And they akuntidzu sin, they throw javelins from horseback
Apotoniipon, as they're riding
Wow, these are some tough people
Kaimachontai, and they fight with the soldiers
They fight in wars, they fight in wars
Isn't that neat?
And then we get the line that throws us all the curveball, okay
Don't take your, take your medicine, right
Take your nausea pills, guys, right
My regulars will know this, right
Take your nausea pills
Heos an parthenoi eosin
Until they become parthenic
Until they become a parthenos
Wait, wait, wait, that's the age of able to produce children
So, but not having had any children yet
That's what a parthenos is, right
You can also call her a heifer, right
Yeah, wow, this is fantastic
Wait a minute, these girls were in the cavalry
And using toxic bows, using the, riding the horses
Yeah, apparently they were so darn good
They could, they could kick anybody's butt
Even the Romans, Mr. Professional Army, right
Even they could, you know, were no match
For these tribes, these horse cultures
That are living around the Black Sea
Some of what you're called the amazonia, right
The amazones, the amazons, the amazons, right
What do we know the amazons do?
We know that they cauterize one breast
Why do the girls cauterize one breast?
Hippocrates says down below
He says their mothers cauterize their breast
Right, their right breast
Why is that?
Because, you know, when you're jumping around on a horse
At Gallop, which is, this is what these girls can do
They can jump around, move around the horse
As the horse is galloping
And they can sit and shoot you from your front
While they're running at a full speed away from you
They can shoot you while running away
That's fantastic
How can you get beyond that?
Wow, that's incredible
Wait a minute, what happens when they become virgins?
There's, right, now you see how terrible my students
You should see how terrible is that translation
For Parthenos's virgin
No, when they become of age
They'll start having children, right
What do they do?
What do they do?
They have to kill three enemies
Once they get three enemies killed
Then they can take a man
It doesn't say they can enter into a marriage
It says they can take a man
They can take someone after they've killed three people
Have to kill three
It's a sacrifice, right?
It's part of the sacrifices that must be made
You talk about human sacrifices, right?
Sometimes in the performance of the mystery
There has to be an understanding of the nature of the sacrifice
And if our young women
Who are going to be producing the future generation
If they are not properly sanctified
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
We don't need any of this, right?
All of this is brought to us as we saw last week
From the microphone by the bow
By that bow
With its poisons
I wanted you to see in the...
Go ahead and put up
Yeah, that's pretty much...
I just wanted to see the next paragraph of that work
He talks about the cauterizing of the breast
And that process of doing it
So, what an amazing, amazing figure
Just stop for a minute and say we stepped out of our ship
We're in the late Bronze Age
And we see one of these people from this tribe
This special tribe that lives around
You know, the Sea of Azov
Yeah, Lake Miotis
Let's see what one of these citizens
You know, for lack of a better word
And that's my word
I'm not giving them that because they didn't talk like that with each other
One of their kind
One of their ethnicity
Let's see what she's like
Let's pull her out and see what she's like
Well, we have a very nice example
That is given to us
Is given to us by a fellow who guarded the sibling books
The sibling books
And everybody's going to say right away
Oh, yes, the heart of Rome
The prophecies, right
All this stuff is written in
No, it's not even the right language you're looking at, right?
Okay, remember, follow the drugs
If you ever get lost, put your hand out
Grab that rope, it's on the side of a cave
And follow the drugs
Follow the drugs
We're going to go to she who was called by Dracontius
Isn't that a nice name?
Dracontius
It means Mr. Dragon
She who is called by Mr. Dragon
Scytha
Scytha
It's our word for the Scythians
Wait a minute, you mean there was one woman
Who was called Scytha
Yeah, and Medell
Who the Median people call themselves after the Medes
Yes, my God, they called her Scytha
Isn't that nice?
They had a verb, scuthizo
Meaning to shave your head
They had to take your scalp, right?
It was proof
If you're going to want to enter into marriage
You have to have some kind of, you know
You got three, are you sure?
It was a big battle, a lot of confusion
You got to show what your worth is
Who is this person?
Let's see her
Let's see who the Medea is
Now, from Valerius Flaccus
I want to go to our second text
But before we do, I just want to tell you
This is a place for the education
So remember that we always have to go to the sea
For that education
Remember who we are
We are farmers
We are fisher people
We are people who range
And migrate and found cities, colonize
And we are people who
Who live on horseback
We're people who become one with that horse
And that horse is something very, very important
That horse is so important
That you see that horse right into the Parthenon
You're thinking, oh my god, what class is this thing?
What does it have to do?
This is too Eastern
Well, it has everything to do with you morons
Look at the Parthenon
Why is she who she is?
Why is there the association of the horse?
Why do we have this divine virgin?
You guys realize we worship this divine virgin, right?
I'm going to show you that divine virgin's most potent drug
Her most potent drug
But we have to start in the sea
Where everything starts
Bring us a sea
Yeah, bring us to a teaching about the sea today
Go ahead
Remember what this F-I-S-H word spells?
Fish
Put the fish right under the sea
There's the fish swimming under the sea
Now you can read the word fish
As you can tell, the Mycenaean Greeks were getting their drugs from under the sea
Yes, they're getting their purple from under the sea
Oh, we gotta love this
Okay, let's bring up...
I want to bring up Gaius Valerius Flakis
And as we're going there, I want you guys to look at this
Your text has a couple of different differences than mine does
I'm using what I consider to be a better text
But there's a couple of minor changes
But this is a good...
Here's a good breakdown of a short passage that comes to us from Gaius Valerius Flakis
I want you to remember now he has access to those sibling books
Okay, so he's...
You could say a...
The last pair of eyes that was on our subject
Right, those mysteries
Embodied in that...
Dactylic hexameter
Yes, those mysteries are buried within the prophecies of the Sibyls
You thought it was Latin, didn't you?
No
Love it
Bring it up
Bring it up
So remember, he's got access to this material
That's the past
And the future in the present
That's how that oracle works
And the last eyes to have this
That we have something surviving from
Our Gaius Valerius Flakis
Who was one of the Quindec and Weary
He was one of the 15 people who guarded these books
One of the 15
Now, you know, some...
Later they disappeared
Destroyed, possibly, possibly spirited off
Possibly hidden somewhere up the backside of some...
Templar
Did you know, really quick, the devil won't mind this
Really quick, did you know those Templars?
In the trials they talk about
They're interviewing some of the...
Yeah, thanks, Chewie
Chewie's chairman, Chewie loves the Templars
Yeah, did you or did you not say the documents?
The Inquisition documents
Did you or did you not?
Lick the tip of the male member
Or the anus of your superior
Come on, people
How many of us have been in that situation?
How many of us have been there?
Yeah, it was purple because it had that drug on it, right?
The Templars had that purple cross in their shorts, right?
Stop, it's not that
A purple cross in your shorts, right?
Why would you have a purple cross in your shorts?
Because they're using that burning purple
Which we'll see, referred to here in this passage
You're gonna love this
Okay, so remember, we're in the cult environment
We just stepped out of our ship
We're watching it, we're sitting
You have a front seat right now
To Ancient Coal
What's going on?
Okay, let's see it, let's do it
I'm gonna read from my good copy, here
Okay, love it
And we begin
Yes, yes, give me a second here
Where did I...
A russus that I'm on, I'm proud to be here
We were Galdens, Matins, Chewie and Mori
Well, it's my order, there we are
My order, Precator Carmina
She prays these greater prayers
My orders, Hecaten, Inmitera, Willis
She prays that Hecates send into her
Greater Willis
What are Willis?
Greater Powers
Greater Powers
Yes, what are these powers?
On a very practical side
We're talking about the capacities of drugs
And this language is used on the medical side
You're about to get hit
With half a dozen medical terms
We're talking about the powers of drugs
Whether or not drugs have been adulterated
Oh my God, you classicists out there
You guys...
You gotta get this together, man
This is our chance
Our chance
Whose chance is this?
This is the muses' chance
Get your act together
Look at what we're doing
She prayed that Hecate would send these powers now
Into herself
Yes, and that she could stand there
She stood there, you know, contenta
Neck contenta, not...
Not happy, right?
Not satisfied
Not satisfied with what?
Nottis winanis
With the poisons that are known
The known poisons, right?
These are the poisons that
You and I would have access to
That we would know about
And she's not satisfied with those
She wants those ones that are in development
She wants those ones that are deep
That you can't get to
Unless you've been initiated
Do you remember what we read about Medea?
That she is that priestess who initiates?
Oh, now we get to see her
Now we get to see Sita
In action, the Scythian queen
We get to see her in action, right?
You say, wait a minute, no, her ethnicity
She's part Greek, right?
Whatever, right?
Whatever, dude, right?
Can you see her?
Let's see what she does, right?
I think she's Libyan
I think she probably has some Greek relations
She's got families, she's got royal ties
So, yeah, lots of stuff
But she's prophesying from Thera
Everybody remember all you classes
Remember that she's prophesying from Thera
Pindar saved that
Her own prophecy
She is the first Oracle people
Wow, before it all blew up
That's gorgeous, gorgeous
Anyway, let's keep going
So what does she do?
In a very unusual line
Yeah, what her?
Wait a minute, who?
Where's the main verb here, right?
Where's the main verb here?
Jump down a couple of lines, right?
Look at Promet
She brings out from
What do you do when you promise something?
You produce it from one place to another, right?
And that can include a process
These are all words that are used
In conjunction with the making of medicines
So it doesn't surprise us that she promised
She produces from her sinus
Wait, what?
She produces from her sinus
Yeah, yeah
After it is
abrasively rubbed round
Yeah, she produces what?
The Caucasian flower
The flower of the Caucasus
Isn't that nice?
What is that?
She produces it
It's a flower
That she produces from
the Sanguinis
From the blood of Prometheus
Yeah
From the blood of Promethean what?
Not just Prometheus himself
From the blood of the Promethean fibra
Fibra, do we have a fibra up here?
Where's a fibra?
Here we go
Look at this, baby, what is a fibra?
Or a filament, that's nice
Look at number two, the entrails
The entrails, now
For those of you who want to take the extra step
The philologist, look at the very top
We're in that second set of lines
It says a fibra, filament, and a plant
And part of an animal's body, et cetera
And it says CFnerus
CFnerus, see the nerus
What is the nerus? It is also a fibra
Or a senu, or a tendon
Right? And he tells us
It's that thing that is stretched out
It's that thing
That is stretched out, that tendon
Or nerve
Right?
Yeah, yeah
What do we have here?
What do we have here?
Look at that, there we go, thanks
Look at
B here, people
Right, look at B here
You see that little Latin expression
Membrum virile
Yeah, what is a fibra?
What is a nerve?
It is that tension that is stretched
When we are going into
the orgasmos
Yes, it is the
Membrum virile
That just means the male
member in Latin, which is
their fancy
avoidance way of saying
penis
Yeah, that's a penis
Right
So, what does she do?
She collects from her sinus
that flower
that flower that is produced
by what? It is produced
by the stretching
penis
Yeah
The Promethean origin
that vulture stands over
It says she is the vulture
Madea is the vulture that
sits over Prometheus
Yeah
Yeah, where is
that Parthenos?
Where is that Parthenos? Okay, buckle up
because it gets even dirtier
and it gets
We are going to talk about
fetuses
We are going to talk about fetuses
This is fantastic material
So she produces this drug
Along with the Gramina
Those grasses that are nourished
by the wind, those erba
Those drugs that are nourished
by the wind
Remember, Madea what writes
is an author of the first
hymns to the wind
Isn't that nice?
Why is she doing that?
Because that's for those with those
who have ears to hear
We know exactly what those
winds are
That's what she works with
Fantastic
Love it
This grur
This substance
It's sacred
And it endures
and grows
On these frozen slopes
In this frozen
mass of storm
Grows this thing
This substance
And it is what? It is
an immortale
It is immortal
It doesn't languisk it
It doesn't diminish
in strength
Linguask it
It doesn't diminish in strength
Not even up to the ends
of the long ion
Right? You like that?
You like that?
And at the same time
Wait a minute, you're starting to get lost
Go ahead and take it down to Latin
and I'll just translate it here
You're starting to get lost a little bit
because you write within the celebration
What happens to this
flower?
This flower
Start
It
Stands
Salus
Safe
Contrafumina
Against the lightning
It stands safe against the lightning
And in the middle
of the flames
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Is it on fire? Yes, it's on fire
In the middle of the flames
Those powers
Open up the florace
You have to have that heat
Remember? Those venom
Provide that heat
We were just looking at Phyluminus last week
And he says those venom
Are powerful because
They contain the seeds of fire
The seeds of fire
Those of you who
Bought into the
Evangelical
Fairy tale
That is the Bible
Yeah, you were ripped off a little bit
There's actual practical history behind here
Right?
Shame on you, Harvard, get your legion up
Go take back the
Take back the New Testament, brah
Right?
Take back the New Testament
Don't you have some scholars out there
Who can do that? Don't you have some people
These archaeologists wouldn't be having so many questions
If we were on our stuff
You know what I mean?
If we were doing what we should be doing
But that I mean classes this, right?
Because I have a Ph.D. in classics
Right?
And if those of us who have been professors
Right?
And our professors didn't preserve
And guard those tags
Then we're not doing our job
We're not doing our job
And you know what's going to happen?
It's Tartarus. You know what happens to those
You know
Who fail the muse
Right?
You come in and you prostitute the muse
Where do you end up in Tartarus? Check it out
You classes know
You know where you end up
The devil's waiting, man
And this stuff just turns him on
People like that just turn him on
He's just waiting to show you
In a Chaldean hoop skirt
Exactly what
You know what I mean?
Let's see what happens here
Who was it first?
Right?
Who was it first who found this?
Oh, it was Hackety, right?
She's the one who first made the
Hotepin or the Fawkes, right?
The Harpy?
She's the worst one to make the Harpy? Yeah
She is. Do you know what a Harpy does?
A Harpy has a scythe
And a Harpy cuts off your testicles
Like that
How would you like that?
Do you know what Hermes says?
What does Hermes say
To the idiot Odysseus
Who's looking everywhere for drugs
Everywhere you find him
He's out hunting for drugs, right?
And he's not looking for drugs
And he stumbles across a woman
Who is going...
Hermes has to tell him
Be careful because
She may cut off your manhood
Yeah
First she's going to drug you
And she's going to use her wand
To do it
No, I don't know
Maybe the appeals to some people
But Odysseus
He didn't want to go that route
You know
He saw what it did to his men
He didn't want to go that route
Yeah
So he made her swear
He made her swear, he's like
Who, and she's like
Well, then sleep with me
He's like
Okay, but
No funny business, right?
So she kept him prisoner for a while
You know, eventually let him go
Because he cries all the time
Odysseus
You thought the Odyssey was about Odysseus
It's not, right?
It's about Cersei
And it's about Medea
And it's about their influence
An amazing influence
These are amazing women
Amazing women, I just want to say a word to Cambridge
A shout out to Cambridge
And you guys know I'm going to do it
Mary Beard, shout out to you Mary Beard
For being so
For being
Such a
Poop-throwing
Primate
That you would
Devour the riches of the muse
And spit out something like
Well, Athenian women stayed at home all the time
They didn't do anything
Which first of all is not a scientific statement
That's not an academic statement
That's just a theory
That you're trying to propagate
It has nothing to do with the actual history
And you know
I hope
In Tartarus
That you're able to find some sort of
Penance
You know, under the heel of
The Medwa
Yeah, the people who are developing
These drugs
And these civilizations
Yeah, this is shame on people
Shame on us, classics
Shame on us
I wouldn't wish
Anything but the highest standard
On classicist
I wouldn't wish anything but the highest standard
You people knew what you were doing
You weren't doing this for
Careers
I don't know, maybe you were
But most of you
There's some kind of kernel
I know, classes, there's some kind of kernel
We want to preserve these tags
You know, Helen comes out and has a party
And put drugs, the wine
So people are so blitzed
They wouldn't care if you killed their parent in front of them
Yeah
And women didn't do anything
Right?
They didn't do anything
No, they just developed a giant science
You know, it's the antikythera
Pharmacology
Anywho, Medea
Is using her own body
In case you didn't notice, she's using her own
Body to produce
This drug
That it becomes the linchpin
Of everything
Nothing can happen without it
Yes, and it's connected with the purple
It's connected with the purple
For those of you, I've got a rush
I can hear the dogs
Beginning to bark
But anyway
Hekate
Showed this to her assistant
To her assistant
She showed it to her assistant
And after
What happened
Who's her assistant?
Her assistant is Medea
What did she do?
What did Medea do?
After 10 cycles
In the 10th cycle of the moon
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, is it Phoebe here?
Is it Phoebe? Let's see
It's the lightener
Yeah
When she's ready
To give birth, what happens?
She met it Feta
Feta met it
Feta met it
Feta met it
What does she do?
She harvests
To feed those
Old stuff
Oh my
God, she harvests the fetus
Oh
This is
Seriously? Yeah, no, this stuff
They're doing is quite
It's again considered a sacrifice
It's considered a sacrifice
And where are you doing this all?
You're doing this in the place
This one's going to throw you
Even the classes you're going to get thrown
Where is she doing all of this?
Yeah
Where is all this practice?
This mystery? Where is it coming from?
It's coming from that weirdess
It's coming from that essence
That is so strong within her
And what is the Roman name
For that essence? Juno
Juno
She now do you understand
Who the wife
Of God is
The wife of God
Yes, Juno
God
Yes, she is that power
Right?
And you suddenly say to yourself
Oh my God, these are all women
We have a trinity of women
That we're working for
Venus, the morning star
Artemis, excuse me
Venus, the morning star
The virgin and Juno
Wait, aren't these the three?
Wait a minute, these are the three
That the Hesperides
The apple
Heracles
Daughters
Poisons
The mystery
The dragon
Yes, yeah, welcome back
Okay, now as you wake up
As you wake up, realize the right
That's going on, the text continues
Flakas continues on
To talk about how he stretches out and rigor
He has his
Moment of release
His pain
It's described as unmitigated pain
As she sits over him
And she bedoos the earth
She bedoos the earth
And that's literally what it says
It says she makes do
D-E-W
D-E-W
From the gore
From that cool
That holy thing
That sits in the poculum
In the sacred cup
That golden cup
She produces the foam
Afrodite
She comes
From the foam
Yeah, are you seeing it?
That's why I told you we had to go to the ocean, right?
And in the very next lines
Venus
Arrives
To both power her speech
In her hand
Her speech in her hand
Yeah, which if you knew the magic
You'd know, oh, okay, this area and that area
Yeah
This is gorgeous, people
And we have so much of it preserved
We have so much of these rights preserved
If classicists would
Get up and start
Doing their jobs
Right, with these tags
Come on, people
Right, come on, take it back
Take back the territory, right
Keep the museum open
Boo to Princeton for cutting
Off its own head, philologically
No more Greek, they say
Boo on you, Princeton
Princeton, I'm sure you have
Plenty of ideas
And plenty of notions
Plenty of theories, and you know what they're worth?
Zilch
Give me some tags
Yeah
Let's roast them
Let's get those people from Princeton
Chewie and let's build that
Barbecue that we found in the Codex
You know what I mean?
A metaphorical barbecue
Let's barbecue them
I got a Princeton guy right now
Metaphorically on a barbecue
And I'm gonna do to him
We'll call him Joe Princeton
Oh, god, I'm just gonna start to like this
This is the season finale, right
For season three, season four
We're gonna bring you some upgrades
Gotta give you some upgrades
And
I'm going to construct
A torture chamber
I didn't want to give that away early
But it's somewhere that we
Can pack young, and now
We're gonna have Joe Princeton
Come here, yes, I'm gonna introduce
I already want to call him up
I want to call him up, you know what I mean?
He has the soul of some
Dead sophist
You know what?
It's disgusting
It's disgusting
The furies, Joe, the furies say
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Long time before
Long time before that was ever
You know
Popularized
We're talking old
We're talking old Joe Princeton
I'm gonna give you a theriac
And I'm gonna administer
Where they administered theriacs
I am, and I'm gonna
Show the world, Joe, what you caused us to miss
We need to see this, guys
I wanted you to see
The strongest drug
Was the one that she made herself
Yeah, I look forward to next season
I look forward to seeing everybody
I'm going to
Officially go on a week's vacation
Where I will
Have one week
To enter in
To cross the spacetime
Continuum
To be able to enter into a place
Associated with the dead
This will be my one week nequion
So it's starting now
It's starting now
I will see you guys back
Friday after this one
For one week, right
We're just doing one week, right
Sorry, chewy plans, I just do
Okay, I'll see you guys
And I promise to bring you back
Fresh, fresh material
Right out of the jaws of those
Demons, right, right out of those
Right crawling right up out of the creek
Oh, I just love it
Hail Satan
