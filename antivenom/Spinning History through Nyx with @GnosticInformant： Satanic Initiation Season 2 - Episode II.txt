Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met, I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace, where is that hawk called destiny
I think she ran on without me
Welcome back to Lady Babylon's satanic initiation
We have some announcements before we begin tonight
I'd like to say we're going to have a new feature called testimonials
And how we'll do that is I will contact you and I will talk to you for 60 seconds
And you will answer the question, how did reason give you satanic freedom?
How did reason give you the unassailable freedom?
If I can get 60 seconds of your take, I think we can see each other here a lot better
I really enjoyed talking to you and getting to know you
Tonight we have the privilege of summoning the ghost of a dead man twice
Gnostic informant will be joining us immediately following the summoning
We look forward to it
Alright, let's get started here
I'm going to show you a very short little video here that I've put together
With another great song from Zane Campbell
But before I do that, I just want to introduce you to somebody named Hormotimus
Who is this guy Hormotimus?
His name means honor of Hermes, right?
Isn't that nice? Hormotimus
So of course that's where we begin
You need to see him
And what I dug out for you from the corpus metachorum grichorum
It's in a section on Ammon's notes
I rather like that
And iatromathematics
I want to show you that source now so that we can visit with a dead devotee of Hermes
Yes, and so that we can understand the initiation
Yeah, fantastic
Let's go ahead and bring this up
No, let's go ahead and start with the video
Actually, go back, yes, I'm sorry, we should do the text first
Text first, yes
So this is, I'm just going to translate this to you quickly, reading it off my screen to you
Yeah, so these things are said about Hormotimus
Yeah, the chlasmenian
Yeah, they say that his soul was separated from his body and went around, you know, a long time
And was able to locate itself in different places and to prophesy
Or to tell the things that were about to happen to the people there
For example, he could talk about whether it was going to flood or whether there was going to be
No flood whatsoever, maybe drought
Whether there was going to be some kind of seismic activity or whether there was a plague coming
Yeah, such things, you know, such things
Now he did this with his body laying there
Yeah, they say his soul came back into his body like it was a sheath
And it revived the body
Huh, yeah, so he would do this thing quite frequently
And he told his wife, certain commands that when he was going into the separation
That she shouldn't touch any part of his body
And she shouldn't let anybody else of the citizens, the locals, don't let them touch it
And certainly not any other men
But these guys came into his house one day and they were pushing his wife
And she showed him, and there he was lying on the floor naked
Totally motionless
So what'd they do?
They picked up fire and they totally burnt his body
You know why?
Because they thought since his soul had separated
It wouldn't be able to return
And that his life would reach its ending
And yeah, so it happened
Now the class of minions, even up to today
When you and I are talking
They reverence
They're motionless
They even built a temple for him
Yeah
And then they forbid that any woman should ever enter it
Because of what I just told you
There are going to be images here
Which I need you as the congregation to be absorbing
To be taking in
Pythagoras said, Hermotimus was his previous
Was his previous incarnation
Yeah, that his soul, Psyche, was the same
So this fascinating art
Of being able to project oneself across time
And space outside of a corporeal form
To the extent that you can
Your Adolon actively appears
And teaches the future
You know, this is Pythagoras, you know
Right up, he's on it
And he's right in the Saturnian gap
And that's where we need to be in that Saturnian gap
We have somebody tonight in that gap
Coming on in just a minute
Yeah, yeah, so I wanted you to
I really wanted you to ground yourselves tonight
Let's watch this video
And then discuss a couple of images
And immediately we'll introduce and bring on
Gnostic Informant
I've refined my tortures
Well, I'm my own inquisition
I have died a thousand times
A life in my petition
The prey upon my weaknesses
You have to know and take them
Where to stretch and pull and stab
Where the pain and fear is greatest
And I know my shame it walks with you
As constant as a shadow
It will never give me peace
It won't go till I go
The torture of the mind is worse
Than calm and sorrow of body
There is no sleep
And when it comes the nightmare is upon me
Horrible imaginings
Make just for me to suffer
My greatest dreads laid out again
Till death becomes my savior
Reason governs substance
That's what Hermitimus was contributing
That there is a quantum universe that exists
And that you can create within that universe
That it is mind
That acts upon the substance
Yeah, Hermitimus
That's quite revolutionary
Did they burn you?
Yes, they burned him
They burned him alive
It's a good thing
It makes you wonder what happened to him
As he was out
Because, you know, if he was like emphatically
You know, he could go to sleep
For 47 years, 56 years, whatever it was
Yeah, and come back
He could move through time like that
Yeah, these are the builders of your true civilization
Yeah, we are going to look at some hymns
But first, we're going to do it through Neil
So I would like to welcome, before Neil opens his mouth
I would like to introduce him as a new man
With regards to one thing
And one thing alone
Before he was goat feces, right?
But now he possesses a name
He possesses a name
That's right, he was able to work
He was able to work through the rites
He was able to skim them
Just with his own...
You know, I wasn't going to do it for him
And to be honest, Neil, I got to tell you
Your final find, I did not think you would make it by tonight
I didn't, I was dreading
I was like, I don't think so
After the pseudo-nix thing, you didn't have the faith in me after that?
Yeah, I knew that
I knew that it would be great to have you so that you could talk about
Can you start us from the beginning?
Can you tell us about casting out demons?
Can you tell us about purification?
Can you tell us about those powers that you're interacting?
Can you tell us about mania?
Can you tell us about mania?
Can you make us comfortable with your Herculean cross-dressing mania?
That's the whole point, is to enter into the mania
And to harness that energy and to hold on to it
And then to focus it on the image of the goddess, Nix
And pseudo-nix means the image of the Nix, of the image of night
And sometimes you might need a little boost, which is, you know,
Some ayahuasca or some kaikyan or something, that gives you that mania
And then that's, you see this even outside of the mysteries, even Christianity
You see this in the churches, people are speaking in tongues
They don't know why that's working, they think it's Jesus doing it to them
But no, that's the spirit of the bakoi, that's the mania, that's the frenzy
That's what that is
So, Neil, could you tell us about working with some of those images?
You went to the Thesmophobia, you went to the Thesmophobia
And I can tell you confidently, from the throne of Satan
Going with the congregation, knowing what that is
We went to the Thesmophobia together
And tell me about the Korah, and tell me about B. Eubuleus
Will you for a second, witness to what's going on?
The dawn, it's that dawn energy
If you know, I want you guys to pay attention to something
If you have a chance to get out at dawn, 5 a.m.
And just take in the atmosphere, there's an energy, there's a magic in the atmosphere
The dawn bringer, Lucifer, the bringer of light out of the darkness
That is the most psychedelic time of the 24 hour period
That is the most, that is the time where you're closest to, if you want to say
This is how I'm going to interpret it, because language is hard to express this
But I guess the best way to explain it would be, that is the time where you're closest between here and Hades
Hades is closer at that time
The portals opened up, that is the time to be doing, get your hymn out
Get your hymn to Nix out, get your hymn to Bacchus out, and do the hymn
That's the time to do it
That's the dawn time, the Lucifer bringing Lucifer from your head
That's what it says in the Hercules
His head was rising with the light
Which was the last word that you told me to look for, which I was blown away by
You look at the English, it's not there
You know a little bit of Greek, enough to translate
Just enough to look up each word, oh I can read the word and look it up
That's all you need to do, because you can go word by word and you'll find it
This is one of the things about the Greek tool, is you become your own translator
You don't need Thomas Taylor anymore
You pull out the Greek, you read the Greek, and then you can translate it yourself and interpret it your own way
There's something magic about that
Hey, all of you who heard that, don't forget that
There's no charge, you're not going to use that as currency
No, because those are holy words
We're guardians of those things
Neil possesses the sacred name, he looks into the hymn
People don't realize it, Neil isn't it funny once you realize how the hymns work within the magic
Isn't it funny that before you saw it is just the
You've been to church and you've had hymns
You've sung hymns
This is the power transfer is amazing
And now you are in night, you are in black night and you're standing
You as Heracles were searching, I gave Neil the search
Which he's now profaning, right?
We're bringing to you, the action is to bring it to you
So live this through Neil, the initiate
I wasn't going to do this if he couldn't unlock that door
He found the thosmophobia, and I knew that he probably would
But I knew this last final key
That I asked him for a name
That he was able to look into the text and pull out
And suddenly make sense of how that hymn is working
He understands, now he's got, he possesses the magic name
So that gives him a vision, right?
That gives him an understanding or a reality
I had a choice to go with the IV diadem or the Laurel
But I wanted the Laurel because the thesmophore is the light
So Apollo is the Laurel
That's why I went with it, I picked this for that reason
And because the Laurel is feminine in the IV's male
That was another
Correct me if I'm wrong, but we're talking
We're standing there with Heracles
And we know the family of Don Bringer
We know that he is both male and female, right?
Yes
You talked about dreams and visions
Could you tell us something?
Please, because after the initiation
You sit with a priest in antiquity
And the dude writes on a scroll what you've been saying
And then they use that, they read off of that
They're really using you as a guinea pig, right?
But they read off of that, it's a real quantum act
So could you tell us about your visions?
Yeah, he's also Diana, the Luciferia, the Torxbringer
My last ayahuasca trip
I'm not going to say when it was
It might have been yesterday, it might have been today
I'm going to tell you, it might have been a year ago
I'll just tell you what it was
Nix was in the sky
She was crying
She was pointing to a bright star in the sky
And I just, I'll never forget it
It was very vivid, it was very real
And ayahuasca is the, it's that kaikion
It is, it really is, there's no doubt in my mind
That the kaikion had DMT and it's just like ayahuasca
It brings you into that media and it shows you something
It's real quick too, but it's all it takes
We were, let's bring it up to the church library
And say here in the initiation
We're concerned with the one most potent element of the communion
Is the historical power of the song
So Neil is, you know, they're going to come
Bust down the door in a minute Neil
And drag you away to the inquisition
And when they do, I'm going to swear
I'm going to swear that you are a Satanist
Like full-fledged, right?
Full-fledged
But before they, before they get here and do that
Neil is talking about a magic
That right now in society is extremely forbidden
And not just for legal, not just for legal sake
Or for clinical health sake
But also for religious sake
Because the communion is that transfer
Now Neil is working on his own end on that, right?
I'm here to provide the images
I'm the mystic god, right?
I'm providing you with the images
That's all, right?
And as I was telling Neil that I was like dude
You've got to do this
You guys should have been there today
He was so mad, he was so mad
And he was like god damn it
Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say it online
He was saying, you know, what are you doing?
What are you doing? You lied to me
This can't be the case
This can't be the case
I went through it here
He's been searching
I went through every word
Greek, one by one
And I was looking up the definitions in the
With these Perseus Tufts
We call it Alice
So I was asking Alice
What's this word mean?
What's the context of it?
What has it been used?
I don't know how many words are in that hymn
100 maybe, 200 somewhere in between
And I went through every single one
Didn't find what he was looking for
What he told me to find
And I go, are you serious?
The one word that I found
What was it?
That's in my Texas to you
It was the one that had Aphrodite's girdle
And I thought you were messing with me
Because I thought I found it
And I thought you weren't telling me
Let's see which one
Where was that? Do you remember?
And I told him
And I told him a dozen times
I told him it's difficult
When you're in this window
Of opportunity
It's difficult to pull out the images
And the focus and the really
So I kept reinforcing with Neil
Ponta Cretor is one of them
Because that's all powerful
I'm like, is it that one?
You're like, no
You're lying to me
And then I found the one that was
Where is it?
The one about Aphrodite's girdle
And I was like, this has got to be it
I was like, there's no way
Amon would not make me find this word
This is too good
Because I was looking at what Alice said
About that word
And there was a ton of initiation
Cult stuff going on with that word
So I was like, there's no way
This isn't the word
And I started getting pissed
I was like, you're lying
And then he like, go through it again
Went through the whole him again
Word by word by word by word
And then I found it
I said his head
Of Hercules
And I'm looking at the English
And it said something about
Hercules' head brings out the light
And I was like, Lucifer
So then I found
Then I went back to the Greek
Where that passage was
And I found the word
It stuck out
It just also, I thought it was a phoros
Dasma phoros
Boom
And I texted you with the bam emoji
Bam, that little like star thing
Found it
And you were like, good work
You're like, let's do the show
And I was like
Yeah
Now you know the place
This helps me learn Greek though
All seriousness
Doing this
I'm looking up Greek words
I'm trying to pronounce them
I'm looking up what they mean
I learned like 20 new Greek words today
From doing this
So this was a very educational process
For me too
This wasn't just, you know
There's another side of this too
Useful
Absolutely
Yeah, now Neil
I wanted to ask you again
You had some dreams
And you're looking at night
And she is the mother
She's the mother of dreams
And I'm just wondering
What then images are you processing of night
As you're doing
As you're going through this process
I'm having
I've been having a reoccurring dream
A lot lately
And this reoccurring dream
And it happens in different ways
But it always ends up the ground opening up
And going down in some like
Underworld place
Whether it be like the one
The one time I had this dream
I was at a park
People playing music
It was like a party or something
And I was on it
I walked up a slide
Like a little kid would
They go down the slide
All of a sudden the ground opens up again
I'm like, oh this dream's happening again
I keep having this recurring
The ground sinkhole
Opening up
And everyone falling down inside of it
So that's one of the things
And I also wanted to ask you this too
What are the odds that
When you and I
A couple of months ago
Or a month or two ago
When we were looking for a secret word
That had to fit a certain gematria
What are the odds that that had
That turned out to be pseudo-nix
The image of nix
And this is all playing out like this
It's interesting
What do you think?
I never thought about it until today
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I'm right, Neil
And that's why I mentioned Hermotomus
Because he is that one
Like Jung was doing in that video
He's the one who is able to make that connection
Right?
He's the
You've been to the
You understand going into the deep night
In order to reach the dawn
Because we are dawn bringers, right?
And you understand the connection
With Lucifera
Right?
Lucifera
You understand that connection
So as you're feeling this
And as you're going
I hate to say meditating
Because it's just like
It's not
It's just you're focusing
You're just setting your mind on something
As you're going through this
That's what we're describing
As a mania
Okay, yeah
Talk about it
Tell me about the mania
Tell me how that is effective
It's the mania
Going through the hymns
Reading the words
Focusing on them
Looking at the images
Looking at the statues
That the ancient Greeks made
The ones they found in Athens
The ones they found in Pompeii
Looking at these images
And trying to connect with the words
And the Greek
And trying to speak them out loud
This mania
It's the energy that comes from it
I know Sobek can identify with me right now
Because we talk about this
There's something and Ariel
Or even probably Snap
Probably a lot of people
I don't know who knows how many people look at
You know what I'm talking about
Something about this search
For the ancient world
Just searching for these texts
That's powerful
And something that
There's a magic from it
It's probably the same thing
That a lot of people who go into
Religious fundamentalism
Get at
But they falsely
Accredited to something that's not
Does that make sense?
Yeah, and does it
There's the context
As you're going through this process
And you're working the initiation
The same avenues that they were working
The same images
Do you find that it's
That it kind of fills you in
On context?
Like right now
You'll go back and you'll find something
That Jesus is like
I am the way
You'll know that he's talking about
The abstract thing
The way or with the mystic
The initiation
The initiation is the initiator
The initiation is the initiator
I am the way
There's one passage
That nobody can agree on
It's the most mysterious passage
He says
If thine eye be single
The whole body is filled with light
And everybody, all the scholars
And all the different Christian denominations
The Orthodox, the Catholics
They all have their own way of interpreting
With how this means
People think it's the third eye thing
But what is he saying?
If thine eye be single
The whole body is filled with light
I think he's talking about apotheosis
When he wants to say that he is one with God
He says that you can do the same thing
He's not saying that only he can do it
Believe in him
Or he's saying
I'm doing it
You can do it
Anyone can do it
He's going for the apotheosis
The attainment of the gnosis
That Paul talks about
The mystery of the knowledge
Which is exactly what I would expect to hear
From somebody who had been initiated
Into the mysteries of Heracles
That's exactly how I would expect them to talk
So do you see
Do you feel
That's what I thought about today
When he showed me that word
I thought I said that's my pharaohs
My head bringing the light
That sounds like
It sounds like that verse from the eye
Being single
Your eye being one
One eye
Bringing light
That's what that means
That's a Luciferian
That's a Luciferian passage all day long
Correct
Correct
And that eye or that ops
That gaze
That look
Is supposed to be
Gold
When it comes to
The medwa
Right
The kurya herself
The one who is the healer
Right
The one who is that sorceress
Whether it's kuryanukta
Or the kora
That kurya is the central figure
Of all the hymns
Of the orphic rite
Over and over for a reason
Right
There's a reason she comes at a lucis
There's a reason that she comes as isis
Right
We know that
We know that there's a
So
How did you feel
When you're in the middle of this
And you're looking at
You know
You want to be like Heracles
Right
You want to
You want to succeed
Nobody goes into the initiation
Want to be told
Ah
You know
Come back in a month
Right
And I
For everybody who's watching this
I gave Neil
No hints
He asked me
Repeatedly
And I told him
No
You have to pull it out
And he pulled
That yosferos
That dawn bringer
Literally
It's in the middle of the hymn
In a mirror formation
So that you can
Right
Because we use mirror magic
If
Since we have ears to hear
Neil has ears to hear
He knows what that means now
He knows how to go back to the text
And see
Oh
Foros seos
Right
Oh wait a minute
Right
There it is
Right in the middle
Staring you in the face
They're saying these
And I'm sure Neil
It's got to be
Back me up on this
What do you think
They said the song
The song of the medwa
Is more powerful
Than the drugs that are involved
That's what
Give me your reflection on that
Yeah
Because the song
Is what gets you into the
And it gets you into that
Like the Pythagoreans
Knew what they were doing
When they were putting together
The eight string chords
And they knew what they were doing
They were fine tuning
The sounds
And making sure that
That song puts that person
Into that trance
Into that mode
To get in that energy
The mania
To get into that revelry
So it's more important
To be there
Than to take the drug
Taking the drug by itself
Doesn't do
Is only half the book
That's nothing
The song is where it's at
The melody
The tune
The hymns
The frequency
That's the word
The frequency
So
Ask any Christian
Who goes to church
That their favorite part
Is the part where
They start singing
And dancing
That's the part
Where they feel the spirit
That's Orphic
So the physics
They're relying on
The physics are there
You know, set within the images
That their religion is pushing
So isn't it funny?
Do you get the feeling now
That this whole last two thousand
Year build up
Of accreted garbage
Has given us this faith thing
We go to church
We have the faith
Or we go through a certain number of steps
And then we have the faith
Do you see how that is not
The operation of the mystery
The operation of the mystery
Is the bringing of the individual
It's like taking a really good
Mom and Pop-owned restaurant
And then corporatizing it
And making it for like every city to have
Every city has a buffalo wings now
But the original buffalo wings
From the beginning days
Was the real authentic version
And it worked
It was a miracle
But all these other fake copycats
It's all just cook or cutty stuff
Eh
You get the little
You get a little bit of a
A little bit of a jolt from it
But it's not the real thing
It's just a copy
It's just a
It's like a ghost of our body
It's not the real things
It's a phantom
You can touch your
You can put your finger right through it
It's not real
You can't grab it
But this
The real mysteries
The real orific
Elysianian
Delphi Mysteries
Are the real deal
That's where all this is coming from
The Eucharist
Drinking the blood
And eating the body
The grain and the blood
The grape and the vine
And the grain
Demeter and Bacchus
Putting them into your body
Becoming Bacchus
By eating Bacchus
By eating the grapes
And drinking the vine
By eating the grain
The old ergot grain
That has been fermented
Taking in those gods
And becoming the gods
Becoming born dying
And rebirth
All those concepts
That you see with these religions
That don't understand
Where they come from
Or why they're even doing it
That's why they're doing it
Because they took a process
That's been working
That has real magic and mania
And they're trying to
Multiply it
Times a million
And it loses its light
It's like taking that
First source of light
This is with the Gnostics
In fact, this is a
Sethian text that says
In the beginning
The Creator was a source of light
And then he begot two more lights
Those two lights had
A little bit more dim
And then those two lights
Begot more lights
And those lights were
A little bit more dim than that
And then after billions
And billions and trillions of years
You have these dim lights
Flying around creating stuff
And that's what
That's what Yalda Boat
Yahweh was
He was one of those dim lights
Who thought he was the
Thought he was the big light
But he wasn't
There really is
There's brighter lights than that
That's what the Sethians talk about
So do you think that
Do you think that impulse
Toward the open eyes
Do you think that desire
To like take a breath
Because you know
As you're going into it
And you're saying, okay
I'm gonna work myself up
In this initiation
How do I do it?
And I gotta do diet
And I gotta do, you know
I gotta regulate
And again, I think
This one is important
For entering that death state
I think it's important
For you to be really close
That way
And to do the, you know
Yeah, if you try to take ayahuasca
With a full stomach
You're puking it up
Yeah
You need at least 24 hours
At least with no food
And if you're gonna eat anything
I think this is interesting
If you're gonna eat anything
They say eat some grapes
Now I think that's interesting
Because what is it
What is grapes?
It's bakis, the vine
The one thing that you can pop
You can put in your stomach
That's not gonna affect the mania
Happens to be bakis
The bakoi, the vine
Actually, I wanted to ask you about that
What do you think about that?
I was concentrating on
I'm getting on that necromancy
I'm always Neil
I'm always gonna air to the side
Of the necromancy
And I think when you put
When you starve yourself
You go ketotic
You enter into that state
Of contempt for the living
And that's what I was pushing
And you know, hey
If I was a little bit rough on you
With the stop eating
Because Neil writes to me
He says I'm eating grapes
And I'm like dude
You gotta stop
Right, stop
You gotta do this
We gotta do it right
This stuff is authentic
That's one thing I like about you, Neil
Is that you not only
Possess the name now
So I have to give you
A certain amount of respect
But you go all the way
You went all the way
You got that final word
I was like there's no way
He's getting it
There's no way, right
I'm taking bets with the devil
I'm like no, no, no
He's not gonna get it
Maybe tomorrow
It was close to nine o'clock
It was good a couple hours ago
You wanna show them to him
And where the word is maybe
Or do you not have
I can pull it up
Sure, yeah, yeah
Let's pull
Let's see if I got it online
Let's see
Yeah, work on that for a second
See if you can pull it
I got it
It's number 12
It's number 12 right here
Dude, it's this one
Derek, please
And he's gonna
It's around line
It's line 11
Okay, I found it
I got it
Let me share my screen
Yeah, and by the way
Yes, please, Neil
Thank you
And by everybody who's watching this
Realize that we are sitting
In the world's virtual museum
We have it
Our fingertips thing
I mean, I know you guys know this
But you need to understand
Why that's so impressive
And how fortunate we are
We should say thanks
So, I'm gonna read line 11
As Neil puts that up there
You see it?
Yeah, horse, pericrati, forace, A.O.
Cae, nucta, melanin
And I told you, Neil
I told you, right
Neil's having these dreams
About night
And I told him, it's with night
That you'll find
Right?
It's with night
That you'll find
And look what he found
He found the dawn bringer
Yeah, why is she?
Neil, what does it mean
When it says that she
That night and dawn are
It literally says
Around the head
Imitating around the head
Of this
Heracles
And we thought Heracles
Was somebody else, right?
You thought he was myth
Fairy tale, blah, blah, blah
Right?
No, I'm talking with
Within the cult now
Neil knows a different Heracles now
Right?
He's a bowman, right, Neil?
Yeah
Yeah, down here
Yeah
Yeah
Right here, right?
Is the bow work?
And he's, and he's mantic
Yeah
Iobolois with his
Now remember, we saw that
You know, it was to the point
That out, guys
I did not know that before today
Now I can, now
I'm telling you that
What you did for me today
I'm able to, I'm able to
Look at some of these words
And point them out
Without even having
The English right next to me
Yeah
Okay, go ahead
Let me cut you off
Go ahead
No, that's okay
The Ioboloi, right?
Those are the shedders
Of the poison
Nero's him
Yeah
Nero got for the sacred formula
Right?
The poison shedders
Yeah
And so
Neil, tell me though
As you're working
These hymns over
And you're going through this
And you're, you're
You're attempting to break
Through that barrier
And you do
You reach something
You, you got that name
You pulled it out
I told you, calm down
You calm down
You cast out that demon
Who was calling me an SOB
Or whatever it was
It wasn't that
You know what I mean?
Yeah
But right, right?
And we got rid of him
As soon as we cast out that demon
Then you suddenly have access
You calm
And the very next text you sent me
Was the exact name
That I was looking for
From the hymn
What's the magic of that?
Tell me
Finding
To, to find that
That, that, that sacred name
That sacred title
So we know what really
What Hercules is
So it's the
Here's the here
For the people on the outside
They hear about Hercules
And his 12
He had his 12 labors
And he was very strong
And he, he went to
You know, he won
Every fight he was in
Yeah, that's great
Cool
But
The inner mysteries
The deeper, darker mysteries
For those who have ears to hear
Is that Hercules
Is the male Lucifer
But also is also
Who's also the female Diana
Very good
And you can feel comfortable
In that
You can feel comfortable
Perfectly comfortable
Satan's
Saturnian by gender
Doesn't bother you
It doesn't bother you
The devil as a sister
Lucifer and Lucifer
Lucifer
And they happen to be a dia
That they're one
It doesn't bother me
I like that
That's something to be proud about
That's something that's amazing
Right
Yeah
Isn't, isn't it remarkable that
That it aren't
How don't we switch, Neil?
How don't we switch our poles?
Where is it?
Right
How don't we switch to our poles now?
You suddenly have
Yeah
You suddenly have found out
You suddenly have found out
That the bad guy is the good guy
And the good guy is a crepe
And so now you understand
Why the whole entering into the morning
You were sending me then
I saw when you understood it
And you were like
Oh, the morning
It's morning
Exactly
That's why I turned the lights off
That's why it's dark here
Yeah
Nice
Nice
I'm surrounded by nicks right now
Do you
What did you write on your head?
I told you
I told you before we went live
I'm not having any lights on
The only light on me is my computer screen
And then I have the red lights behind me
That's it
All the lights are off
That's it
Could you show us your head?
Because I know you wrote some things on your head
Could you show us your head?
Oh, yes
Look at that
That
That is the son of Heracles, right?
That's the son of Heracles
Yeah, let me see
Okay
All right
I couldn't really see what I was doing in the mirror
So if it doesn't look right
Can you read it at least?
You understand
I can't read that one
Is that nicks?
Yeah, it's Greek
Yeah, I can't read it
Who?
Yeah, I can't
It's probably because the camera is reversing it
Yeah, I can tell
This is NYX
And then here's the Greek
Oh, I see
Oh, I see
Yeah, no, it's backwards
Look, you wrote it as if it were the reflection
That's fantastic
I didn't even realize that
I didn't even realize that
Mirror magic, bro
Now, wait a minute
Everybody who's watching
Why?
What is he doing?
He's putting the names of his God on his head
And if you remember
Not only did the bad guys do this
But the good guys do this too
The early Christians are talking about being branded
With the name of God
So, you know
Neal, physics here
What does it do when you put that name of that God on your head?
It's freedom
It's that freedom to be one with the power
With the demonic power
The demiurgic power over creation
The keys to victory
That's what that feeling is
Nothing like it
Yeah, you've been sitting
You can sit on that throne
And you can feel that kingdom power
Definitely love it
Being anointed by NYX
Yeah, nice
Now, last question that I have
And I'm not going
I can't make it to the
And I know people are going to want you to stay
So, I'm not rushing
Because I want you to answer a couple
If I can get two more questions, I'll be happy
But I can't go to the after meeting tonight
But I want to
I'm going to be getting in touch with those people
And I'm going to be doing short segments
Of your testimonies
Breaking out of Jehovah's Witnesses
I can't wait for that one
That one's going to be fantastic
Yeah, well, no
It's going to just be one testimonial
See, it's one thing to just be a regular dude
Who wants to join this
And get something from it
And that's fine
But it's a whole other thing
To leave the false religion
For the real religion
That's something
Whoever that is, I don't know who it is yet
He's not telling people
This is all private
I have no idea who it is
But whoever it is, I already know
You're in that mania right now
Feeling it
You're leaving the church
You're leaving that shackles behind you
You're starting a new thing
Nothing wrong with that
Awesome, I support it
I felt so
I don't know
I'm sure you felt this way before
And maybe I'm just feeling it for the first time
But I feel such an attachment
To what people were saying
Because people were coming forward
In the discord and saying, yeah, I was this
And I was there for so long
And it was like, well, what broke you out?
What got you out of your prison?
And it's over and over and over again
Neil, it looks like the audience has this
Consistently built into it
Is this just because we're...
Is this how the world is
That we've all been put into these cults
And now we, you know, it's time to try to build one
They don't have the options
That's what I'm saying
My mission in life before I die
Is at least start one
I want to have 100 around the country
But at least start one temple to Bacchus
Somewhere
Start, and then once that one gets put up
Someone else will see it and say
We're gonna start one in my city
And next thing you know, there might be a city
That has more temples of Bacchus
Than there is Catholic churches
Catholic churches, we might even take an old Catholic church
That turn, that fell apart
And rebuild it as a temple of Bacchus one day
That's what we need to start thinking about
That's ahead of the times, man
You're...
I think you're ahead of the times with that one
Imagine if people were like you
And had as much guts as you do
And that same vision
And, you know, started building temples
Started going back to the pagan practices
That built things like democracy
That's all we had to do
We had to say, what was the algorithm
That allowed you to do democracy, you know
And how do we worship that?
You know, Mary, Mary Beard
They worship female gods, Mary
There's a reason, let me ask you that, Neil
You're talking about night, black night
Dark night, who is a female
How does it make you feel to worship a female?
Absolutely, perfectly fine, great
Makes sense
It makes sense
Like, I don't know how to say it, it just makes sense that way
Because we were born from a woman
That's where the...
That's Sophia
The ancients weren't stupid when they assigned Sophia
To be female, they weren't just making...
They knew what they were talking about
That wisdom, that divine wisdom comes from the goddess
You see, this man did more
With the songs of the ancient priestesses
Than he did with all of your modern scholarship
And all of your feminism
He just was able to break through, you know
To that place
That special worship of the great mother
It almost feels like your life as a man
Is incomplete
If you don't have that
You sent to me one of the clips that you sent to me
You said, oh, wait a minute, it's the child nourisher
Right, you were recognizing
You were recognizing those attributes
Those symbols were coming out to you, they were healing
It's a healing presence, don't you think?
When you cast out those demons, it's a healing presence
I think, what do you think?
I agree, 100%, couldn't have said it better myself
Yeah, it's that
Okay, so you have the great mother
And then you have Saturn, the father
But you have to enter into that divine child
Rebirth, death, and come out as the divine child
And you need to reach that apotheosis
And become one with the mother and the father
And then yourself
Now, does it bother you that Jesus, or do you understand
When Jesus is saying, look, look, look
You've got to re-enter the womb a second time
He's the most misunderstood person in the world of history
He would have been one of us, he wouldn't have been
If you actually could resurrect him
Brought him back, he would not like
Where his movement turned into
That's my final, I'll never be convinced otherwise
But if he came back, he would be just disappointed
In what his name ended up as
He'd be looking for people like you and me
Say, that's what I was talking about
That's what I meant by being God
By calling yourself God, that's what I meant
You can do it too, that's what he would say
Do you think now that you have been through
The gallery that is the Hercules initiation
And you understand the core Dark Knight
Do you think you could help explain
Help explain why the Christians
Would be so fearful of this cup of porneia
Giving goddess
Why? It's in all the apocalyptic
It's all there and it's all a big important part of it
So in your experiences now
You're looking back and you've gone through this
You've been through it and you may continue
You may make yourself do it again
Do you notice Apuleus is like
There's a whole bunch of different times
That he's initiated, right?
Augustus, the emperor of the western world
He had been initiated like five times, they said
Twice in the Ulysses itself
He didn't have to go there twice, but he did
He went to Delphi, he went to all these different mysteries
And got initiated and he wanted to be that August one
He wanted to be, there's something about that
Yeah, for sure
And another thing, I was just talking earlier
I was starting with Dr. Andrew Henry
Scholar, we're talking about early Christianity
And this is the...
I know you're gonna have to have me
I know you're gonna know what I'm saying right now
And you're gonna be...
Because the default position by scholars
When they talk about the Ophites and the Nasins
The serpent Christians
The ones that had the Agathos Daemon
The good Daemon, this was a charm
A magic charm that they would put in their house
For good luck, it was a serpent
And anyways, the Hippolytists
Irenaeus, Justin Martyr
All these guys that are writing about these heretic Christians
And saying that they're all drinking porneia
And having orgies
Clement of Alexandria is writing about this
And the scholars today
The default position is
That they're probably just making themselves to make fun of them
Which could be true, but
I've heard a few people
And I know you say this too
We know the Bacchic revelries are real
We know these rites are going on all over the Greek world
So why can't the Christians do it?
Right, it doesn't seem to...
It doesn't seem to fit when...
You know, okay, look
What is better than these gods of antiquity
Than the god Don, right?
Who would you want to embrace more than Don?
When we perform the mystery
We know that that time is our time
And that we rise to her, right?
And that does something to us
Guess what? The Christians
Were doing exactly the same thing
Haven't you ever wondered why it says
They all got up early and they all went out?
It wasn't because Christianity went
Pop onto the scene
Which is, I swear, what the academics
Support, right?
They know that's not the case, but it's what they support
Yeah, and you're exactly right
In undercutting the Ophites
And saying, oh, it's the...
You know, they're just making this stuff up
To make their enemies look bad
No, they're doing exactly what the pagans are doing
This is a pagan mystery
That's what I'm saying, at the Ophites
Were around to defend themselves, they would say
No, no, that's true
We were getting down with the mysteries
The Nazan preacher, I mean, come on
What does the Nazan preacher say?
He says, I call the Attis
The Assyrians call you Attis
The Egyptians call you Dionysus
I'm sorry, I gotta fix this
But it's okay, I can hear my voice anyway
The Thracians call you Adamus
All these different names
And he says, you know, the player of the pipes, Pan
The player of the flutes, Orpheus
He's naming all these names off from the mysteries
And he's identifying the Christ as that
So there's no doubt in my mind
That the Nazan preacher was doing this type of syncretism
There's no doubt in my mind he's part
And they're all into the mysteries
They're all into the mysteries
So you can't tell me that they weren't engaging in
The same things that were people in Aleutius were engaging in
And getting that mania going
That was the way to do it
That was the Orgiastic rights of Orpheus
The Orphic theology is what gives us Christianity
To begin with
Right, exactly
Okay, everybody heard that?
Not from me, from Neil
And I'm 100%
100%
Because he's talking about the evidence now
He's just talking about who they were
These people, what were they doing, right?
He's got nothing to grind
He's got no position to keep
He doesn't have anybody to impress and look good
He's just holding up the evidence
Neil, I'm going to
Oh, do we get you back?
Yeah
I'm going to go ahead and cut off
But I thought I would
Let you end it
Let you end it
With something that you wanted to say
About the value
About the value of getting those images
Right, of digging in
Just tell me
You're going to report back to the dojo next week
For Greek
And when I give you Greek assignments
And I'm yelling at you to get them done
You'll understand, I'm doing it now
To get you to have those eyes
You've begun to see those texts
Now, what do you anticipate
From this point out?
You realize you can do everything now, right?
If you perfect this art and this skill
Now you can act as that intermediary
You don't need me
And that's why I enjoy doing this
Is because it's me teaching you a skill
I thought it was the perfect thing to say to people
It doesn't even have to be Greek
Even though that's where I would go
Because I think the Greeks have
I think they are the brilliant minds of our world
But learn Sanskrit
Learn Coptic
Learn Latin
And then go back and re-translate some of these texts
For yourself
And that is where the magic happens
When you do the work
When you get that gnosis
It's not about just believing what the text says
And just believing that
Some guy translated it for you correctly
And you're just going to watch a YouTube video
Go in and get the gnosis
Get that divine knowledge
Learn the languages
Go back, translate it for yourself
And I'm doing John
I'm looking at John
And I'm finding out right in the beginning of John
Not only is there the Lagos
Which is a concept that means nothing
Way more than just the word
That's not what it means
But not even just that
That's kindergarten stuff
The next passage, verse 3
Talks about the life of Zoe
Did you know that Zoe is in John?
No
I just found that out from going to the Greek
You wouldn't know that from the English
But Zoe is in there
So the Lagos is Zoe
I even had to ask Litwes
Is the Lagos a female?
He said some people do think that
He said that's good translation
No, that's not in the English
But I found that
I found that from my own translation
The Lagos is life
Zoe is a female word
Because it ends with that
Excellent
You heard it from the Gnostic informant
Get off yourself
And move over a cushion
And get a program
That'll help you learn
Coptic or whatever
Look, we're sitting in that museum
We're sitting in that museum
Anybody who doesn't get up and do this
Thank you
Gnostic informant
It is an honor, sir
To be, to serve with someone
Who has obtained a secret name
Yes, Hale Satan
Hale Satan
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
