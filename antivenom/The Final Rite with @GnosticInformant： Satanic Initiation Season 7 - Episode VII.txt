You gave me hope when it seemed hopeless You put a song in my heart
Showed me a road not often taken You gave me a start all the way
Why did you ever change your name all the way?
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean Wild and free you came
And you were like a storm coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name all the way?
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to Satanic Initiation on this second to last episode.
This will be our official last Satanic Initiation. Wednesday will be our official last Bible studies.
Thank you for coming tonight. Thank you for coming.
Before I tell you what we're going to dive into in Omega, I want to tell you tonight we will have Gnostic Informant come in.
And he was unable to make it last time because he wasn't feeling well.
But now he's bouncing back and he's ready to go and he's got the stuff to make everybody hate him.
I also want to say really quick, there is an outstanding up and coming scholar who's going to rip the backside out.
Right out of that Victorian smile.
And he goes by Old Boy, A-U-L-D-B-O-Y.
And he just produced a magnificent, a magnificent video on Etruscan Deity.
Oh, I can't wait until you see her. I can't wait for it. You got to go for it. So that's Old Boy.
Yeah, nice job, Old Boy. Way to strike out, man.
And his Greek, his Greek is getting better and better all the time. All the time. Why?
Because I'm looking for Greek students to pull in.
I'm looking for people who want that skill, who can sharpen it, razor sharp, razor sharp.
These are the people we need and I'm educating them in the dojo.
There's not really any education going on. I'm just teaching them how to use the Greek and they're doing a great job.
So if you get a chance, stop by Old Boy.
Tonight on Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation, we are going to dive into the Omega, into the Omega.
Now, tonight is the most crucial night that everybody out there, everybody joining us.
Put down your popcorn for a minute, put on your ears to hear.
Because I'm going to be saying things tonight that only you will catch, a steady stream.
And I want you to catch everything so that our initiation can be complete.
Tonight, we're going to give you something a little special. This is the last one.
Right, we're just going to have one more Bible study.
So in this Satanic Initiation, I said, look, devil, we've got to bring them something good.
Something none of those other mortals would be able to come up with.
I mean pastors, priests, I mean Bible scholars, I mean all of them. None of them's got it.
Tonight, I'm going to bring you the prophecy.
Prophecy the world hasn't seen in a couple of millennia.
Prophecy about someone special.
Tonight on Lady Babylon.
We've got a lot of weight tonight in just a few texts and I want to bring it to you.
I mean, this is crushing weight. This makes the scholars look stupid.
This makes the last 1500 years of history look stupid.
You're going to love this. Oh, God. And all it is is the evidence.
That's what you get. Love that evidence. I love that evidence.
You know what I mean? It's those texts. That's all we need.
Clean this place up and how could we most appropriately purge the temple in our final Satanic initiation?
Only, only one way.
With the great mother of the Roman people.
With Venus herself. It's the only way that we're going to find this temple complete.
In order to bring the Omega. Chewie, hit it.
You saw it. It was hidden. You might see it again. Oh, my God, I want to go right into tonight.
I'm going to bring you a couple of texts. We want the morning star tonight, right?
We want the morning star. We want to bring that purification.
Let's go to her then this bringer of light. Let's go to that Alpha and Omega.
Let's go to the first text. Chewie, hit it.
Boom. Okay.
Oh, and he showed me a river of water. What, what, what kind of water was it?
It was water of life and it was brilliant.
It was brilliant like Krustalon. It was brilliant like crystal and it flowed.
It flowed out of the Thronos. It flowed from a Thronos.
Yes. Look, did Jesus give hand gestures? It flowed from a Throne.
It flowed from a Throne, but it's not just any throne. It's the Throne of God.
Okay, this is the end that I am reading you. The very end in culmination.
Have some respect for the Word of God.
And it comes from the Throne. What is it coming from? It's coming from the Throne.
What Throne? The Throne of God and the Throne of the Arnion.
The Throne of what? Who? The Throne next to the Arnion.
And just tell me, tell me really quick. What is crystal? Krustalos.
What is it? Ice? Ice? Some kind of glass? Looks like glass. They used it as glass.
What is number two? It equals narke. Narke.
A numbness or a torpor. It comes. It comes from this creation of the frozen. Boom.
Narcotize yourself. Narcotize yourself. You're frozen.
Oh, I see. I see. I see the ice. Go back to the frozen, Chewie.
Go back to the frozen, yeah. Who's this? Who's this?
Go ahead. Click it. Click it. Who's this? What's this narke? What's this narke?
Look, it's a numbness. It's a numbness. Look at number two.
What? Yeah, it numbs. You can't believe these people put this thing on their heads.
People got off on electric rays in antiquity. We have descriptions of it, dude.
You don't know. You don't know. You think you've been high? These people.
These people were getting loaded on everything natural, on electricity.
Wow, that's some abusers of electricity, right?
You thought electricity was just for, no, it's for this, too.
I want torpor, people. Thank torpor. What is the state of torpor that's being induced?
Go back down. And what is the arnion? What is the throne? What is the throne?
Who's it belong to? What is it? There's an arnion that it belongs to.
And everybody says, little lamb, little lamb.
Rides, a rain. A little tiny one. Arnion.
That's diminutive suffix. Isn't that nice?
Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Don't think you know everything.
Look at Roman numeral number two. A fleece. A fleece.
Didn't she know there was a throne? Yes, yes, I did.
But did you know that there was a fleece on the throne?
All right, of course there is. What world did you think you came to?
This is history we're talking about. Okay, let's go to the next one.
Boom. 222. Here we go in the middle.
In the middle of the road of this place.
There's a river in this tree of life.
Wait, Zoe's tree is here? Wait, wait. Zoe's tree? Yes.
Zoe's tree. You remember her? She was that woman that was brought to the atom.
She was that woman that was brought to the atom, right?
Jehovah was trying to make things right within the mystery.
Brian, what happened? Devil, devil let her have the drugs next thing, you know?
You know, God's full of it. You know, God's full of it, right?
We know the good and evil. We know it. You've tasted it.
You people have tasted it. I've tasted it.
You can't get away from it. We're witnesses. We know.
We know we've all had it. Let's go.
That water is undeniable, people. It's undeniable.
In the middle of this place, you know, this tree, this tree of Zoe, by the way,
it grows on both sides of the river. Huh?
Hang in there. It has what kind of fruit?
It's got 12. 12 kinds of fruit? Yeah, according to each month.
According to each month. That's a very classical thing.
And they produce, this tree produces fruit.
We want it each time the proper time.
And the leaves, by the way, take it down. Take it down.
The leaves of this tree, people, delete.
Wait, and you say, wait a minute. Did we get out of the ship yet?
Yeah, we got out of the ship. We got out of the ship and paradise again.
How do we get back to here? This is fantastic, right?
The end goes back to the beginning.
I am the Alpha and the Omega.
Yeah. Thank you, Jesus. Morningstar. Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go. Say thank you, Jesus.
No, don't talk to me. Don't talk at all.
Now, I want to, before we, in order to, in order to, you know, kind of lubricate the system here,
in order to kind of get us kind of warmed up.
Here's a little vibration. Here's a little vibration from work.
This is a cult work that hasn't been translated since 1865.
And it's hiding. It's hiding something wonderful.
And I just want you to see it tonight. Mixmer, strong, obsidian, tears distilled from pine.
You like those tears? Remember who loves those tears?
Oh yeah, Mary Magdalene. You want to put her up? Should we put her up there?
You got Mary? Mary Magdalene loves those tears.
There she is. Look at that druggy.
Look at that druggy in a cemetery.
Those druggies entering death and resurrection.
Freaked out of their minds. Love it. Let's go back. Let's go back.
You wanted to see the real history. This is it, people.
Did you think she was normal? Of course she wasn't.
Tears distilled from pine. Oh, yummy.
With flakes of talc that like the silver shine.
This shall reveal whatever men seek to know.
And omens give.
The coming wheel. Whoa.
Yeah. Yeah. This is what we have to look forward to.
What did I bring this to you for?
We've talked about it many times, but people in antiquity are using drugs,
are using drugs both for medical and for psychological,
for spiritual, for religious reasons.
Christ is a medical term.
It's a religious term.
Yeah. It's a pharmaceutical term.
Yeah. You people don't own it and the classes are sitting like this.
Really? Because you don't read those texts. We know you don't.
We know you don't. Corpus Metachorum, Greg Corum.
Look it up sometime, you big boys from Harvard.
Looks like you guys got in trouble recently. That's a shame.
Oh, you're such a, you're such a drag on progress in scholarship.
Oh my God.
Okay, people, that's why I like to teach rogues.
That's why I like to teach Ronan.
Are you Ronan? You come to me.
You want that tool? You want that tool to kill?
I'll take the best. I'll take that best, that tool that cuts the soul.
I'll give you that. I'll give you that.
Okay. Let's go. Let's go back.
I'm sorry. I'm starting to enjoy it too much.
We also want to be intoxicated.
We want to be intoxicated. Look at that.
The second word there, people.
Oh, what do you want? I want to be intoxicated.
But you know how I want to get my intoxication?
I want to get it mastoisin.
I want to get it mastoisin.
Has anybody heard that root must?
Has it mastectomy?
Mind. This is becoming enthusiastic through the breast.
Through the breast.
They were using milk products of humans to get high
and to get into states of altered consciousness.
Yep. Yep, they were.
You just saw it. You just saw it in the Greek.
There's no going back, people.
You think, oh, the initiation, it was going to,
woo, no, you were shown a world.
You can't go back.
You'll always know those of you.
I just want to say this.
We're going to have our jury on Wednesday
and we're going to pronounce the verdict
when it's handed down by you guys, the jury.
And then we're going to have sentencing
if it's a guilty verdict.
But what you don't realize
is that when we all walk away from it,
none of us can escape the reality of what we've seen.
You have seen Jesus Christ in his natural habitat.
You have seen him as he was in history
and you can't turn away.
You were always going to look for that naked boy
that was with him when he was arrested in Gethsemane
at 4 a.m.
You can always look for that naked kid now.
You can't escape.
You who are Christians,
you should be upset with what I've done to you.
That image that you have stayed here so faithfully
and received in your brains,
burned into your minds is your son of God,
sexually abusing children.
Yeah.
Wally's on drugs for cult's sake.
What do you think the Christ was?
Let's go to the next one.
I can't wait for this prophecy that I've got.
It is so hot.
I'm actually bringing you a prophecy.
Prophecy?
I'm saving it for the end.
I'm going to try to get there in 45 by 45 after
because I want Gnostic to jump in.
Okay, let's go.
With its complexion of a lovely boy,
the opal fills the hearts of God with joy.
Thank you, translator John.
Thank you very much for that nice rhyme,
which we know isn't in the original,
but I want you to notice,
we are around pirates.
We expect boys to be in the mix.
We expect the boys to be here.
We're going to the Omega.
You didn't think we'd make it, did you?
But here it is.
Next one, please.
Next one, please.
This is all cult, people.
This is all cult.
A mighty spirit, Phoebe Hath,
inspired within these gyms
by his own radiance, fired.
Okay, so these are from that religious text.
I'm not even going to tell you
what it's called or who wrote it.
They don't know who wrote it.
They don't even know what the date is.
They don't.
They can't date this thing.
And scholars who debate back and forth,
they don't, you know,
you could guess at which one is right
from the evidence that they've got.
You could guess.
That's it.
Let's go to another one.
Let's warm us all up.
Above all gyms, fierce Mars,
the lodestone loves for eagerly
to meet the steel it moves,
as the fond maiden bright
in youthful charm strains the love of youth
within her longing arms.
So tight the lodestone
in its eager grasp holds the love steel
reluctant to unclasp.
Cersei, they say with magic lore and beaut,
armed with this stone,
her potent filters brood.
Tee's daughter loves the lodestone too.
Let's go to the next one.
Take it down.
Why Mars?
Why Mars?
Don't miss that.
Don't miss the powers that are being used.
Don't miss the science that is being
beautifully woven into
this form of worship,
this mystery that was so important
in antiquity, this thing
that went back to the Queen herself,
the Lady Babylon herself,
the biggest enemy of Jesus Christ on the earth,
Lady Babylon.
Yeah, love it.
Let's go back to the text.
Boom.
Soon will we prove the virtues that I teach
when we the altar of thy Savior reach.
So, stop it for a minute.
Everybody, pull out,
pull out your,
I'm going to stand outside myself for a moment
and look at this situation.
That's what we need.
Do that on the throne.
The throne will let you do that, right?
It's a function.
Go, same text.
For yonder slave,
can everybody see that slave?
For yonder slave, companion of my road
on his broad shoulders, bears an ample load.
Who is this guy?
But since undone our journey's greater part,
fear of the monster fills thy beating heart.
Is this you?
Attend whilst I in antidote declare.
Look at them with their drugs.
Constantly,
dote and antidote.
No more of the trailing serpent's tooth to fear.
Why not?
Why don't we need to fear the tooth?
Have you been pushing the tooth?
Is this for you?
Do you burn with that poison?
This will counteract it.
Let him who by the dragons fang have bled.
Is that you?
Is that you, sister and brother?
Is that you?
Have you bled by the dragons fang
and in the stone his sure reliance place
for wounds inflicted by the reptile race?
Have you been inflicting the wounds?
Have you made the Medusa?
Do you see her?
Do you see her coming?
Can you reach out?
Can you reach out to her?
You were reaching out to an entity.
This is not a mortal.
This is a diamond.
You're reaching out to it.
You Christians,
you have participated.
You have participated in the act
of reaching out to the Daimonis.
Yeah, you have.
Did you feel that voice?
You heard that voice at the very beginning.
You saw Satanic initiation and you said,
run that voice that Pima said, run, run.
This is of the devil.
Now you're corrupted.
Looking at it from our direction,
from the direction of this congregation,
you're cleansed.
You're cleansed, excuse me.
You're cleansed.
But from your own direction,
you've been sullied.
Look at yourself,
what you've participated in.
These images won't leave you.
You're marked now.
You are marked like a record.
Your life is a record to be read out
in a cosmic court.
You are marked.
Go, I mark you.
It's part of the contract, people.
Next one, yeah.
Yeah, oh, here's a good one.
What are the drugs can we get?
Oh, people, let's get some more drugs.
The ostrates mixed with wine
affords again a quick relief
to cool their fiery pain.
Let those of you here,
you know, who've got the ears,
do you understand the transformation here?
Those of you have been here.
Do you understand how we are describing the right?
The sacred stone that from the Viper came.
Well known to leeches
by the Viper's name.
Have you ever met a leech?
Does anybody know a leech?
Take that down for one second,
and I'm going to put it right back.
The leech, do you know the leech?
They bleed you.
They bleed you.
Why would they bleed you?
Because they need your blood.
You mean it's not just me getting rid of my blood?
No, it's not just that.
That blood is a resource.
Hmm.
Strange.
Especially if you are of a certain persuasion.
And what persuasion is that?
If you are the one that is born
by the goddess producer,
the Theatokos, Mary,
aka Mary,
if you are born of her,
it is your blood that saves.
It is your blood that saves.
Do you see what they did with Jesus?
Poor little baby.
You didn't even see a comment.
They've already got the gold
and the drugs set up.
They've already got that muron
that ends up on his face.
They've already got the basics for that.
They're ready to go.
Plus the financing.
This virgin girl is going to produce
one whose blood will save us all.
Do you wonder why Jesus
walked around talking such things?
Do you wonder?
Did you thank Christians
that he just got ejected
up from the sky into a woman's uterus,
into a girl's uterus,
into a 12-year-old's uterus?
Oh, God, it's so gross to talk about
the origins of Christianity.
It's so gross, but somebody has to do it.
Okay, I'm sorry.
The devil hates that, right?
You won't see him hanging around.
You won't see him hanging around
doing stuff like that.
You didn't see Lucifer
get arrested with a naked kid, did you?
You didn't see Lucifer
blowing his top
and kicking all of his people
out of his garden.
You didn't see him do that.
Lucifer has class, man.
He's got real class.
Hell Satan.
Let me hear it from you.
Hell Satan.
Hell Satan.
That's right, man.
Not arrested with a naked kid.
Do you think Lucifer's going to be
up on charges like that?
No.
No transdimensional court in the world
is going to do that.
Everybody knows.
Man, he's the...
What are you?
Let's go back.
Go back to the source.
Let's go back to that one.
Yep, keep reading.
So what is this leech doing?
Yeah, the sacred stone
from the Viper came.
Okay.
Listen up.
Well known to leeches by
the Viper's name.
Aided by which,
divine McCann's art
cured the rankling wound
the nine years smart
when the despairing hero now
no more hope for deliverance
from the festering sore,
but taught its virtues
by his sire on high.
With this he healed
the bold
Piantian's thigh
and sent him forth rejoicing
on his way to Troy,
the Phrygian ravisher to slay.
It's...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What kind of code is all that?
Right?
You heard the surface?
Now realize there's something
called the Orphic Vox.
The Orphic Vox
or the Walks Orphica.
The Orphic Vox.
And realize that you are hearing a story
and underneath the story
because you have been here
and those who went
who've been through the whole seven seasons
you're picking up those symbols like that
and picking them out.
You're getting faster than I am.
Right?
Okay.
So you know that there's a story
and underneath the story is a point.
Underneath the story is an edge,
a razor's edge.
And that's why we're going to bring you
the prophecy tonight.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Boom.
Far greater fear
and never slumbering day or night
had Philctides of the viper's bite.
That's who was healed,
Makaion.
That's who...
That's who is healed.
Right?
Philctides.
He's the one who's
subject of the viper's bite.
Are you subject to the viper's bite?
Do you know who's worthy
of the bow of Heracles?
Do you know who's worthy?
You know what Heracles uses?
He uses the poison of the Hydra.
You squirm bags.
Yeah, that's how he would refer to you.
Yeah.
You bags of squirming rotten flesh.
You haven't been purged.
Let me introduce you to the Hydra.
Oh, God.
Who wants to go?
I want to go.
Can we just say
I want to go.
I want to go.
Can we just field trip?
Everybody?
We'll go into the mysteries.
Now, some of us may not come back.
You know, nothing ventured.
Nothing gained.
Go.
Let's go to the next one.
Oh, yeah.
Fall from the beat.
To teach some charm
that far away should chase
whenever he reached his home.
The reptile race touched by his prayer.
The wizard high reveals
the sought for antidote
nor art conceals invokes Apollo
witness of his truth
and give these precepts
to supply it.
Youth.
Yeah.
There's the youth coming to him.
Did anybody see the boys coming in?
Have you people become comfortable
enough with the pirates
to understand what the business is all about?
You remember when we were on that ship
a couple of seasons ago
with that Thracian pirate?
You remember what he did?
He had his guys go ashore
and take that young kid
and then he told him,
bring him to his room.
He's the best looking.
Right?
Best looking Thracian they could find.
And they took him.
Took him to his place of surgery
and cut off his testicles
so that when he awoke
because he had to keep him drugged
while he was asleep, right?
When he awoke,
what happened?
He was transformed into an angel.
Have you ever seen an angel birthed?
Those of you, we stand around
and we think, I say angel
and you think fairy tale.
I know you do.
You think dude in a white dress
maybe long blonde straight blonde hair
pale skin like a European
maybe blue eyes, right?
Something like that.
Big and tall and very pious looking.
Right?
No, no, no.
That's not.
That's not how angels were born.
Right?
That's not how angels were brought about.
You mean angels or creations?
Yeah.
Just like the Medusa.
Right?
And by the way,
that concept of an angel that you think
is central to Christianity and Judaism,
guess where they got it?
It's a Greek word.
When that dude in the third century,
the person in the third century,
probably Jewish,
who wrote the Torah in Greek
for the first time,
when he did that,
the bonehead encoded.
He used the Orphic mystery.
And I'm going to show you tonight.
I'm going to break the code.
Plutarch knew this straight up.
And Gnostic informants going to tell you
how Plutarch knew it.
Right?
But that tribe of Levites,
that tribe of Levites,
guess where they come from?
Oh my God, are they in on it too?
Are they in on it?
Holy mackerel.
Let's look at it.
When this thing was written,
when your Torah,
when your Bible was written,
the Old Testament was written
in the third century BC,
the knuckleheads that composed it
borrowed from the cult
that was present in their society.
It's not a surprise.
It's not a surprise,
but they weren't smart enough
to hide it.
They just left it in the open.
It just says it.
Okay, let's keep going.
I'm getting my blood is up.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Every time biblical scholars,
I smell a biblical scar.
It makes me so mad.
If I had a room full of biblical scars,
I would be like,
okay, now I'm going to hold you
accountable for all your BS, right?
And I'd be like, stand up.
Come here.
This is my fantasy.
I can have fantasies too.
What I would do.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hurt anyone.
Nor would I cause any sort of
permanent damage to their
fragile psyches.
No, of course not.
This is all in love.
When you purify someone,
come here like this,
biblical scholars, come here.
Come here.
Here, take down your little pants
and bend over.
No, bend over.
There you go.
Thanks.
Did you know there's no term?
That whole Urim and Thurman thing,
those actual Hebrew words,
you know, they're not in the Septuagint.
They totally altered the text afterwards.
You know what those guys were doing
with the Dead Sea Scrolls?
They were making Hebrew versions
from the Greek.
Oh my God.
And everybody's like,
oh, this is so wonderful.
We have something.
No, you don't.
You have Greek,
you have copies of a Greek text.
That's all.
Appropriation is appropriation.
This stuff belongs to the Greeks.
Who do you think was making profits?
Go.
Let's go.
It's Bronze Age.
Greeks aside.
Pulaski.
And if we want to give credit,
we've got to say Pulaski.
Because it's old.
This technology is old.
Let's go to the next one.
For all the pests that out of earth arise,
the earth's own self,
the antidote supplies.
She breeds the viper,
but she too, the sage.
The means presents to quell,
sorry.
The means presents to quell the viper's rage.
All kinds of gems spring from her bosom wide.
Yeah.
And hapless mortals
with sure help provide.
Let's go to another one.
Do you see how much
where is the thinking here?
The scientists are thinking
we get dotes and antidotes.
We give drugs.
They cause a reaction.
We give antidotes to block the activities
or the symptoms that those drugs produce.
We make a cocktail so that we can specially design the person.
Imagine if it's the future
and you can walk up to a panel
and you can push button
and you can say,
I need a combo that lift me up,
pull me down,
put me this way,
make me feel this.
Give me a couple inches of height
and maybe make me aroused.
Boom.
Out it comes.
That's only because of people
who have done thousands of years of work
on what those substances do.
That's a lot of laboratory time, people.
That's a lot of laboratory time.
And who is the one culture that we keep seeing?
Who that are really pioneering this?
Dote and antidote.
What's the one culture?
It's those children of the sun.
Daughters of the sun.
They're the ones who are doing all of this experimental stuff.
All of this experimental stuff.
Did you see in this cult text
that I've been reading you
from the translation?
That's what the English is that I keep putting up.
It's all cult text.
Did you notice the names that we've mentioned so far?
Cersei and Medea.
Of course.
Of course.
Let's go back to the next source.
This is going to get really good now.
Hold on.
Okay.
Yeah.
And he showed to me a river.
And a river of water of life.
And it was shining.
It was crystal.
I just want to keep going.
And it was coming out of the throne of God
and the sheepskin.
And in the middle of this road,
there was this tree on both sides of the river.
And what happened?
It made these fruits.
It produced these 12.
It made these 12 fruits.
They produced according to each season.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the leaves.
They're for what?
For therapy.
They're for therapy.
This is medicine, people.
It's the tree of life.
What did you think we were doing?
Go to the next one.
Boom.
I just want to keep reminding people.
And every curse, look,
and every curse is going to go away.
Do you know why he says that?
Every curse is going to go away.
Now you evangelicals, you're thinking,
because this is from the Bible, right?
This is, this is the revelation or the apocalypse.
Right?
What's the curse that's going to,
it is the sin, my son.
It is the sin of the world being taken.
No.
You moron.
We're talking about a healing cult.
Yeah.
And those curses, they cause disease.
They cause disease.
You don't look at the world that way, do you?
No.
Because you don't know what curses are
and how to use them.
And thank goodness you don't.
Thank goodness you don't.
Let's go to the next one.
Next one, Chewie.
We can't teach best to advance.
Next thing you know, we'll be having outbreaks
and all sorts of things.
And you know, look, these words are true
and faithful.
The Lord God sent out his angel.
Right?
And what's this angel going to do?
He's going to show to the slaves of Jesus.
He's going to show the slaves of Jesus.
The thing that's going to happen,
whatever's going to happen, man.
And it's going to be quick.
What's coming soon?
He's going to show him.
He's going to show him.
And he says,
Hey, pay attention.
This is Jesus.
I'm coming.
Morningstar.
I'm coming, he says.
I'm coming quickly.
And what's going to happen?
Blessed is the one who guards the logoi,
who guards those words.
Logus.
What words?
Words of the prophets.
Yeah.
Okay.
Words of the prophecies of what?
This book.
Those who guard these prophecies are the ones
who were following the mystery.
And by that,
I do not mean sitting in your movie theater,
watching your show,
the Cummings massacre,
or whatever you call it,
getting off the boat late.
What did they used to call that thing?
That idiot that was in that sitcom in the 80s
was big into it.
Some author made a gaggle of money
writing about the fear of the coming.
Here it comes.
So much so that I had a relative ask me,
would I watch your dogs
when Jesus comes back to get her?
People.
People.
The fairytale.
The fairytale is dragging you into idiocy.
Do you know what the people said
when Peter and John showed up in the city
to preach?
Do you know what they said?
These are Greeks.
I don't know about you,
but these two bozos are idiots.
They're illiterate.
They're illiterate.
Did you know that all the time
that Jesus spent with those boys,
he didn't once give an alphabeta gamma?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Go to the next one.
We've got to get work.
We're coming down to the back stretch, Gnostic.
Just give me a second.
I'm coming in.
Blessed are those who wash their gowns
in order that the force,
the forceful essence of this
from that tree might come upon them.
Right?
After they get it,
we can go into the city through the gates, right?
You want to go to the city through the gates?
Got to have the water of life, boneheads.
What's outside of all this?
All of us.
Look, we're all sitting here satanic congregation.
We know what we've got.
We've had the water of life.
Who are the boneheads?
Who are the boneheads?
There are a bunch of other people, says Jesus.
We're trying to do the same thing.
Wait.
What?
Yeah.
The people who are against this, they're all cuneists.
Dogs.
And everybody translates that the same.
Dogs.
Dogs.
Why would he say dogs?
Why would he say dogs?
Jesus.
You got something against dogs?
I come to thank you, but I never saw Jesus
ever pet a dog.
And that makes me sad because I love dogs.
Jesus Christ bend over.
That's for being mean to dogs.
But it's not really his fault.
Because these cuneists that he's talking about,
this is a select group.
This is a known group.
Hercules is accompanied where he goes
by his Phoenician dogs.
Yeah.
Do you know who the enemy is?
To this Christ who is Venus, whose mother was the
goddess bearer?
Do you know who he is?
He's the enemy of the dogs.
What are the dogs doing?
Let's bring that passage back up.
What are those dogs doing?
Oh, God, look at them.
Oh, God.
They're prostitutes and drug users.
Those cuneists.
We all know that.
And they're murderers, too.
And they're idolaters.
They're idolaters.
They're idolaters.
They're idolaters.
They're murderers, too.
And they're idolaters.
You know what they do?
You know what they do in the darkness of their temple?
Yeah.
You know what they do?
Yeah.
Okay.
Jesus is competing with them.
Right?
He's competing.
When that pithia comes to Jesus,
comes to Paul and says,
you're doing the Christ thing.
He's like, shut up.
Right?
He follows them around.
And then ultimately gets her in trouble
and he gets himself in trouble.
Right?
Couldn't just keep him out shut, Paul, you druggy.
You couldn't just keep him out shut.
She nailed you for her you were.
And because it scared you like it did Peter,
you shut your, you tried to shut her up.
Right?
She's just a woman.
Unfortunately for you, she was a woman
who was an oracle.
And it caused you to get the,
you know what, beaten out of you.
Who wants to see Paul?
Who wants to see Paul with those people?
Have a mess with this girl.
Because she's a pithia.
Have a mess with this girl.
And now people are beating him up.
Right?
This is the reality, people.
This is not fairy tale.
Paul, they ought to show this one.
Why don't you guys illustrate this one
in your Sunday schools?
Why don't you show Paul harassing a girl?
Misogynist.
Better to marry than to burn.
You sicko.
That's different.
That's a different court.
It's going to deal with that case.
Let's go to the next one.
And behold, you know, I come quickly
and my reward's with me.
Yeah, just jump down to 13.
We've got to hurry.
I'm the alpha and the omega.
Do you see that?
I'm the alpha and the omega.
The first and the completion of things.
Right?
The initiation and the completion.
Do you understand the omega?
The omega is when everything comes together.
This is the beginning and the T loss.
This is the completion of you.
The completion of you.
Wait, it has to do with me?
Yes.
It has to do with us.
The completion of us.
Next one.
Let's go through these.
Oh, I, Jesus, sent an angel.
Yeah.
To witness to you these things about the churches.
I am the root.
Right?
And the offspring of David.
Now, what else does he say?
Yes.
Look at the second line.
I am ho Aster.
I am the star.
Ho Lampros.
Which star?
The, you know, the bright one.
Does everybody know what the bright,
shining morning star is?
The pro oinas.
Proinos.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's that morning star.
Everybody knows who the morning star is.
We Romans.
We worship the morning star.
Bunheads.
Right?
Not you.
We worship that morning star.
Let's go on.
Let's go on.
Hmm.
Who do you think is the alpha and the omega?
Didn't you think Venus was the alpha and the omega?
Of course.
Right?
It has to be.
A lot of you thought Venus is Venus because I've seen her through a modern lens.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Venus is much more than you think.
Much more.
So much more that Jesus is stealing her thunder.
Isn't that nice?
Jesus is stealing the thunder of the goddess Venus.
Right?
That's her title.
That's her title, you moron.
Take that away.
I take that.
I petition this court to remove the title of Jesus.
I petition this court to give it back to Venus.
To whom it belongs and to whom it was with for thousands of years.
Give it back.
Belongs to her.
Let's go.
Next one.
Oh, look at this.
Look at this.
Okay.
Yeah.
This is the river.
I don't know why.
I wanted you to see it again.
I wanted you to see it again for some reason.
But I've got four or five more.
Let's keep up a pace here.
Look at verse 15.
Now you're saying, where is this from?
Guess what, kiddies?
Remember that Jewish guy that wrote the Torah in the third century BC?
Remember him?
This is what he's writing.
And this is from Exodus.
It sounds so funny, right?
Extodos.
Guess what language gave us that?
Right?
Okay.
And what did he say?
What is God's command to Aaron and the boys, the Levites?
What's the command?
What's the command?
And you got to make an oracle.
You got to make an oracle?
Logheon is an oracle.
You got to make an oracle of Christian.
Whoa.
What?
Go to the next.
Go to the next.
You got to make a what?
You got to make an oracle.
Look, people.
Look at number two.
They knew this in antiquity.
I mean, they knew this in the last 200 years.
I'm not bringing up anything new.
This is the thing that they're making that the high priest is going to walk around in.
Okay.
Do you see it?
Here it's coming.
Here it's coming to reality.
Ready?
Ready?
Go to the next one.
It's what kind of oracle is it?
It's an oracle of, look at number three and four.
It's an oracle of election.
It's an oracle of dreams.
It's an oracle of dreams.
Importance.
Didn't you know that the tent that Moses set up was called a Telestarian?
Telestarian.
Now there is no word for that in Hebrew, right?
So all of this has to be fudged when it's time for people to appropriate and they start
taking the Greek and translating it into what is by then liturgical Hebrew.
So they only have like, they only have like 8,000 words.
I'm sorry, but it is such a bad idea.
It is such a bad idea.
The fact that those knuckleheads couldn't figure out that they couldn't possibly translate
the technical terminology is hilarious.
I had a couple of verses for you.
I was going to bring and show you just, it was verse 12, 28, 12, and I was going to show
you, um, look, the Greek uses two words with the same root right next to each other for
a reason here, like it loves to do.
And the Hebrew doesn't know what to do.
The Hebrew doesn't know what to do.
So it uses two different, totally different terms that are only related to the art that
the Greek is talking about.
The art that the Greek was talking about is embroidery.
Right.
So, um, it's, you know, it's there, it's there.
I hope, I hope, uh, it's, there's so much to be done.
There's so much to be done with that.
Let's keep going.
I'm almost there.
Nostics.
I'm almost there.
But wait, we've got a good thing coming up.
Okay.
Blow this up.
Now people, here is the sacred document.
And I just want to, I, I've shown you a couple of lines of this in the past.
This is the Orphic Lithica.
Right.
And he says, look, Hermes, the son of Maya, he, he came here and he gave us a gift.
He gave us the gift of the danger of hurting Zeus or the danger of hurting God.
Right.
And what is this thing?
It's an, it's a remedy.
It's a remedy for all of your pain.
It's a remedy for your pain.
Yeah.
And the mortals that take it, right?
These people are going to, they're going to do good things.
Right.
And they have to be in a certain state.
They have to have a heart that's pure.
All right.
You got to have pure heart.
These Satan still wants you messing around with any of this magic.
If you're not pure heart, you know what I mean?
Come on, man.
You can't get there anyway.
You got, you have the least bit of greed in you.
You have just one sliver.
Throw that silver coin out.
You grab that thing.
That's it.
You're done.
There's no purity there.
You greedy scumbag.
That's what the, that's what the furies say.
Greedy scumbag.
That's their line.
Okay.
Look, it's not right.
It's not right for people who are like these bad people.
It's not right for them to have visions anyway.
So the stuff that I'm going to show you,
it's, it's just for those of us with ears to hear who have been purified.
And once you, but how do you take someone who has,
who believes, you know, maybe they're Buddhist,
maybe they're Hindu, maybe they're Jewish,
maybe they're Christian, maybe they're a Mormon Scientologist.
I don't care.
Right.
Maybe they're an atheist.
Maybe they're an atheist.
They sit around.
What gets the Christians, what gets the atheists or what should get them is that
they're named after the Christians.
The Christians are the first people to achieve that name atheist.
Isn't that nice?
Why?
Because they don't believe in justice.
Christians don't believe in justice.
No, they don't.
Do you want evidence?
They'll take out your government.
Yeah.
They don't care.
Justice doesn't matter.
They let criminals out of jail.
And they'll put people in jail for taking care of their own bodies.
Yeah.
I'm just telling you what Julian said.
I'm just telling you what Salsis said.
They are illiterate idiots who will take down your government.
This is what they're all saying from antiquity.
And you and I are watching it.
We have a front row seat.
Jesus must love the hell out of us because we're right there to watch them take it down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You remember the blood of tyrants and their patriots must be shed where you will not retain decay.
You won't keep your liberty.
You won't keep your freedom.
I'm sorry.
That's my American coming out.
There's got to be a little American in all of us, right?
Okay.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Is there a problem?
Hang on.
Shoe isn't a kid and there's a problem.
Let's pause for this message from your sponsor.
Who is this?
Who is it?
I can't see.
I can't.
I can't read your lips.
Oh, did you hear?
You're not supposed to say anything.
Okay.
Decay.
Oh, and by the way, people keep asking, when is Chewie going to show her face?
When is Chewie going to show her face?
It's mystery.
Let's go back to the text.
Back to the text.
We're almost done.
We're in the stretch here.
I'll hurry us along a little bit.
And what do we really need to know?
Look, this is part of a tradition.
This thing that Hermes passed down to us, this gift, it's gone through people like Apollo
to his son.
It went through Athena to others, citizens, people like Heracles, who were able to pick
it up and were able to what?
Were able to mount the ether.
They were able to mount the ether.
Can you hear me?
These are the people who have done this through time.
Chiron is one of them.
And what did he do?
He taught the art to his boys.
He taught the art to his boys.
And substitute Jesus for Chiron.
And it's the same cult.
We still get Christ.
We still get sons of God.
We still get death and resurrection.
Okay.
What about that prophecy?
Promise me.
Let's go on.
There's a lot here of what's promised, but let's go on to the...
I want to see the prophecy that nobody's revealed, but I want people to have tonight.
Okay.
Now, I want you to recognize really quick.
This is on the lithica.
And I just want you to see on the authorship of the poem.
This poem is considered by some hoo-ha to be the production of some Asiatic Greek.
That's a just slight, just a slight hint of kind of eugenic-y kind of thinking.
Right?
I mean, technically, you know, he's from Asia.
Well, whatever.
It doesn't matter.
Written in the fourth sense.
That's the guess.
After the profession of magician had been made a capital offense by the law of constantious.
Right?
Okay.
He even conjectures that the godlike prophet that we're to talk about now.
Keep going.
Oh, is what?
Well, let's get to some drugs first.
Right?
Yeah.
The salagramma or sacred stone of Vishnu.
I don't know how to say that to you.
I'll defer to snappy on that.
Some stone sacred to issue to Vishnu so much used by the Brahmins and all propitiatory
rights, especially at the moment of death is described by somebody as a kind of ammonite
to very heavy oval round black.
The very wrinkled ponderous round black or rights of Orpheus.
Orpheus.
Sometimes it's colors violet represents that vindictive avatar.
Okay.
Take it down.
Take it down.
Wait a minute.
Well, I thought we were in Greece.
We're all over baby.
We are all over the globe.
Go back to the next one.
All over to the all over the globe.
Here we are.
I want to give you a few, a couple of passages here.
Here's the prophecy people.
Are you ready?
What's going to happen to this God prophet?
Who is this God prophet that's coming?
Who is this son of God that is coming?
Who's going to use the gift of Hermes?
Who's going to know the ambrosia?
And like Chiron is going to pass it on to his boys.
Who is this?
Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you who what happens to this prophet, the boys who have
soft, I'm translating the boys who have soft flesh.
They grab him with their little grabby, grabby hands and cause him to enter desire.
Okay.
It's getting a little bit strange.
Keep going.
This is unheard.
Are you ready?
And the soft Korah, that soft Korah.
Does everybody know the soft Korah?
That soft girl pulls him into her bed because she is always, always, always just.
Hot and bothered for phylotes.
Oh my God.
She loves that stuff with the kisses, with the kisses.
Let's keep going.
Are you serious?
This is prophet.
Yep.
I'm serious.
Are you ready?
It's going to start to sound familiar.
Give me the next one.
And what's going to happen?
Look at the second line.
When there's a storm on the sea, he's not going to get upset.
He's not going to be shaken.
He's going to walk on the water in his feet.
Will be as if they're on dry land, on dry land.
Does that sound familiar to anyone?
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
Why do you think Jesus was talking about?
Well, this happened because this prophecy has to be fulfilled.
Uh-oh.
Look at line 40.
Look at line 40.
Jesus, this isn't starting not to look good.
And the pirates.
The pirates who are atypical.
What do they do?
They abandon him.
They abandon him.
You know those boy pirates?
You know that rock that he was raising and pulls out that sword?
He's going to be the next pirate.
He's going to be the next lace-dace.
Did you see the word lace-dace there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Lace status.
There's our plural.
Look at it.
Line 40.
Right?
And what's going to happen?
Look at the next line.
It says that people are going to what?
They're going to see the father in him.
They're going to see the father in him.
And they're going to love his kingdom.
They're going to love his kingdom.
Wait.
This is prophecy?
Yep.
It's prophecy.
Let's see if it came true.
Let's see if it came true.
Go to the next one.
We only got a couple of these left, right?
This is coming up on the end.
What else can this prophet do, this God?
What else can he do?
He can see into people's brains.
He can see what the mortals are trying to hold in their minds.
He knows what they're contriving.
He even knows what those bird songs are, those creatures that hover in the air.
He knows when they give out their Bacchic song.
He knows these things that are unheard of by men, right?
Who don't have ears to hear.
He knows the birds, those prophets of Zeus.
He knows them.
What else does he know?
Uh-oh.
This is going to scare you.
Are you ready?
He knows how to establish the rush of the coming dragon.
And he knows how to balance the drug of the snake.
You see line 49?
You see where it says, oh, Eon.
There's our Eos people.
There's our Eos people.
And how does he get transmitted to them?
I'm going to give it to him.
I'm going to give it to him in the holos.
I'm going to give it to him in the bile.
You know what that bile is in the box?
That bile is serpent venom.
He's going to be a master of the serpent venom.
He's going to be screaming about people who are thirsty.
He's going to be bringing people into death and raising them again.
Are you, let me ask the Christians, are you ready to be raised from the dead?
Are you ready?
I'm speaking to you.
You evangelicals, you ready?
Because you know Jesus can do it.
You know he can raise from the dead.
You know you can drink those drugs that'll kill you and they won't.
You know you can lift up those vipers.
Wait a minute.
You don't?
Is a Christian?
You don't?
Then you're not a Christian.
Turn around and walk away.
You didn't come here as a kid anyway.
You weren't put through the right.
You're uninitiated.
You are unborn again.
You know what you are?
You're a psychological deviant.
You're a psychological deviant who thinks you're in a state that they were in an antiquity
and you're 180 degrees off.
You're 180 degrees off.
God, it's embarrassing.
Somebody's got to show you the history.
Right?
Somebody's got to show you.
We've got two more slides.
Go.
Actually, I want to quit right there on that last slide.
Just bring that last slide up one more time.
I think it was this one.
Bring that one up.
Yeah.
A thousand other blessings heaped on high, stored in the cave of skill for Hermes lie.
Immortal true of wonder's potency, who so attains a happy man as he.
Isn't that nice?
That's a little Victorian misogyny cuddled in there too.
But there you go.
There you go.
Love it.
Love it.
Okay.
Let's bring in Gnostic Informant.
Gnostic Informant.
Thank you for coming.
I really appreciate the fact that you would join me and miss my second to last episode
for Satanic initiation and Bible studies.
Yeah.
Tell me something.
Tell me just really quick before I get into the interview part.
And people love to see it.
People last time were saying in the comments, they're saying, whew, he's so hot.
Well, I got, I want to add some sources to compliment to what you've already brought
brought across because I think the main, the main theme here and the main theme of the
Saint, Saint Technician in general is there is no escaping the world, the Greek world
that these religions are operating in.
Theology itself comes from the Orphics, Orpheus being called the first theologian.
All of this descends from Medea and the magical rights that came out of Colchis that influenced
the Etruscans, the Greeks, the Romans, the Carthaginians, the Egyptians, everybody.
And they call themselves Orphics, the Pythagoreans.
Pythagoreans are basically Orphics that are living in Italy.
Plato was one of these people.
He called himself an Orphic.
He starts Platonism.
The Stoics come along and the Stoics and the Platonists mix together.
You get middle Platonism.
It's where Christianity comes out of and so forth.
And there's no escaping this.
There's certain...
When they're speaking in their languages, whether it's Hebrew or Greek or Egyptian,
there are certain words that etymology goes back to these Orphics.
And I'm going to show you the word Eucharist.
You and Chorus to give grace.
That's a technical, cultic term.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
First, I want to show Paul, our buddy Paul, our peer Paul.
He has obviously no links to Medea, right?
That would be crazy.
Medea is a witch.
What would Paul have to do with Medea?
Let's go with the source that I got the first one I told you about when I'm the share screen.
This is from Titus, one of the letters that are attributed to Paul.
In the spirit of Paul, maybe one of his...
Maybe somebody who Paul is traveling with, whatever.
It's Titus.
It's got Paul's name on it.
And if you go down, he says,
One of Crete's prophets has said it.
Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.
This saying is true.
Okay.
What prophet is he talking about?
Who's this prophet?
Why is he calling him a prophet?
Well, it turns out this is from Epimenides.
Most people would already know that.
But here's the thing.
Epimenides didn't make this up.
Epimenides is citing somebody.
And I'm going to go to this screen now.
Epimenides is citing Medea.
Here it is.
He reports, Athena Doris of Eretria in the eighth book on his commentaries,
says that Thetis and Medea had a dispute in Thessaly.
You know, that's where the Pulaskians settled.
As to which was the most beautiful, their judge,
Idomenius, who gave victory to Thetis.
Medea in anger said, the Cretans are always liars.
And in revenge, she made the curse that he would never speak the truth
just as he lied in his judgment.
There is that Epimenides paradox right there.
Epimenides is citing Medea.
And then so by extension, Thetis, Paul, is citing Medea.
There you go.
You can't escape Medea's influence.
No matter how hard you try to purify or separate,
those are pagans and we're Christians, we're different.
We're going to put a fake border around Israel or Judea and say,
this is Judaism and everyone else's pagans.
No, no, no, no.
You don't get to do that.
This is all the same cultural milieu.
They're all being influenced by these Orphics,
these ancient magical rites.
Medea is, she's a magus.
Her and Cersei have the famous Rambos,
which is what Jesus is depicted holding.
Let me show you guys.
Here's Jesus holding his Rambos.
These are the oldest images of Jesus in existence.
Before the beard of Jesus that everyone knows,
he used to be depicted like this, without a beard.
In fact, sometimes there's actually,
they found a statue of what they thought was Apollo.
Exactly like Apollo.
That feminine look that Apollo carries.
Then they found out later on, it wasn't Apollo.
It was a statue of Jesus.
They just took a statue of Apollo and called it Jesus.
I'm just trying to explain to you the imagery,
the culture cannot be escaped.
The influence cannot be escaped.
Jesus is a magus like everyone else is.
Now, I want to go to Revelation.
This is Revelation 1,
where you have this idea of this Jesus coming.
The hair on his head was white like wool.
His eyes are blazing with fire.
His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace,
and his voice was the sound of rushing waters.
In his hand, he held seven stars.
What is this?
What kind of imagery is this?
This is everywhere back in this time period.
You have the images of the invincible sun.
I'm going to show some more.
This is one coin of Roman Mithras,
with the seven stars.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
There's your crescent moon,
and there's your gradient crown.
This religion of the unconquered sun
comes from the east,
in particular the Caucasus region,
where the Magi are.
The Persians are mainly influenced by this, too.
Ultimately, if you go back far enough,
you'll see this is from that little wedged region
in between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region.
Medea is the daughter of the sun.
There was the kingdom of the sun,
the Bosporus kingdom.
Even in the time of Augustus,
this area of the world was so revered
that no one was allowed to have a kingdom.
You couldn't have a kingdom under Rome.
You have an emperor,
and everybody is either a console
or a governor, some sort of tetrarch.
But the Bosporus was allowed to keep their kingdom.
The only place in the world
that was allowed to keep their kingdom.
There was a lot of respect paid to this part of the world.
When Ovid got in trouble,
he had to flee to that part of the world.
He had nowhere else to go.
He had to go to the Bosporus,
where he'd be protected, basically,
as like Edward Snowden is right now,
where you're in trouble.
If he goes back to America, he's going to get arrested.
But he can hang out in Russia.
It's kind of like that.
It's kind of like Ovid, right?
So now I wanted to show that,
but I got some slides that I want to go through now.
And it's relating to these rights that I'm talking about.
I want to explain what I'm talking about.
Oh, I think...
Yeah, technical difficulties, people.
Just a second.
Joey, were we flying through an asteroid?
Back.
Here he is.
Here he is.
Okay, good.
What do you think?
No, hold on.
Let's give me a second,
because I've got to load it back up again now.
Okay, okay.
Let me say, while Mastic is reloading up here,
let me just say how nice it is to hear the words of Medea
out of the lips of Paul the Apostle.
That's so nice.
And what's even maybe even more incredible
is to hear it from Epiminides.
Because Epiminides, the prophet,
he's considered the one...
He inspired some stuff that ultimately ends up through Solon
going into a world of democracy.
So these people,
especially the pre-Socratics man,
you cannot not give them enough credit.
I mean, this guy is the Thomas Jefferson of antiquity.
Thomas Jefferson and this guy, I guarantee you,
Epiminides and Thomas Jefferson are sitting in hell right now
with a table and a fine French wine.
And they are both having a conversation that
the demons are just sitting there like this.
Oh my God, these guys are fantastic, right?
So hey, thank you for that Epiminides link.
And also the fact that Colchis is a region of the world
where this art is evolving,
that ultimately is the mystery that Christianity and Judaism spring from.
Yeah, I love it.
And this is where you get the Medes who name themselves after Medea.
You have Herodotus explains, right in book one of the histories,
that all this comes from Medea.
The Trojan War itself is a result of some things that happen
according with Medea and Helen.
But I got some slides that I want to bring on the screen now.
And now I click the right button.
So this is from Plutarch.
I'm going to go through some stuff that Plutarch has to say.
Plutarch is talking about this Zorrest or Magian.
He says before the Trojan War, he says 5,000 years.
I don't know about all that.
I don't know where he's getting that number from.
Anyways, but he says he calls the one Oramazes and the later Aramanios.
And there's something that's going on here that we see in Judaism
where you have the Yom Kippur or you have one goat
that you set off into the wilderness, which is Azizel, the evil.
You have these two different opposing spirits, right?
This is something.
This is coming straight from Zorrest,
who is in part of the same region where Medea was located.
Anyways, he says, furthermore, the objects of sense,
the one resembles light, the other darkness.
Mithras is between the two.
The reason the Persians Mithras, the mediator.
Remember Jesus says, I'm the mediator.
And he says, I am Lucifer, the bright and morning star.
This is all cultic terminology that we see everywhere, right?
So mediator taught them to offer sacrifice and vows and Thanksgiving.
That's in English.
If you go to the Greek, you could check.
You guys can all check.
Hopefully you guys are checking me.
I don't want you to just take my word for it.
If this was hit Amon doing it, he would just have the Greek up
and I'm not as good as that.
So I just kind of go with the translation.
I checked the Greek just because I want to know.
I don't know what's the terminology.
The word is not Thanksgiving.
The word is Eucharist.
He says that he's saying that Zoroaster taught the rights of the Eucharist.
This is exactly what it says.
And it says vows and Eucharist to the one of deprecation and mourning to the other.
The rights of mourning, ritual mourning of Adonis, right?
Ritual mourning of Jesus.
And for they bruise a certain herb, I think it's Amon or something.
And it's in a mortar and they invoke Hades with it.
Mixing it with the blood of a wolf they sacrifice.
And then they carry it and throw it into a place where the sun never comes.
In this plant, they call the daemons, right?
Okay.
Now, the reason why I wanted to show that is because I'm going to go,
because Plutarch in another text that I have right here called the Symposiums,
where him and his buddies, and he's with his teacher, his name is Amon.
By the way, Amonius, that's his teacher.
And they're discussing, what is this God of the Jews?
So go back to the slides if you can.
And it says, all right, who is this God?
Who is this God, right?
And he says, what's the mysteries of the Jews?
And is there a solid reason that we can give him to prove Adonis to be the same with Bacchus?
Here's where we get into the syncretisms that we see with these middle Platonists.
They're syncretizing.
They're syncretizing.
They're combining all these gods into super gods, right?
So here we're seeing the rites of Adonis and Bacchus being mingled together.
And he talks about how, I'm just skimming through this.
You guys can read this.
Pause it later, or come back and pause it.
Read the whole thing.
I'm going to flip right through it.
He says, the Holy Son of the Jews is exactly agreeable to the rites of Bacchus,
for which they call the feasts that they celebrate in the midst of vintage,
furnishing their tables with all sorts of fruits.
And they sit under the tabernacle.
Oops, I'm getting ahead of myself.
And then it says that over on the right, he says,
for they have the trumpets and the Grecians use this at their bacchanalia to call upon their gods.
And he's noticing they're doing the same rites as people in the Ellisonian Mysteries.
He's, I'm watching them do the exact same thing.
They're dressed the same.
They have the same priestly garments.
He says that the Levites had this name that looks a lot like a group of priestly class called the Lucius or Aeveus.
Either way, whichever one of the etymology is, it's agreeable to Bacchus.
He's like, he's looking at this and saying, these are the rites.
And the reason for this is if you try to separate Jerusalem as like this branched off force field world where everyone else is separate from them
and they have no influence on the outside.
They don't know anything that's going on anywhere else.
You're going to lose this.
There's a way that priests get ordained in the ancient world.
And it was typical of how they offer incense on certain days.
Certain priests have to do the certain things.
They have a certain way to build their temples with the Holy of Holies in the middle.
You see this in Egypt.
You see this in Judea.
You see this in Syria.
Oh, this is how this was done.
This is a Bronze Age tradition from Medea.
From that time period, passed down everywhere throughout the entire Mediterranean world.
We call it, I'm going to call this the Bacchic Empire.
You start to see this.
There's commonalities amongst these and they overlap each other.
It's no different for the priests of Israel.
And so let's keep continuing on with this slide.
You could see it with the way they dress.
This is a Christian Orthodox priest holding the staff.
On the right, you're probably wondering, what's that on the right?
Is that just another staff?
No, no, no.
That's a Hermes staff found from 500 BCE from Athens.
And that was welded onto a staff where the priests, the Yaobakoi, they're called.
And they held, they had their high priests holding these.
This is a Juan.
This is a Rambos Juan.
It's a magical instrument.
And you see this Orthodox priest is holding it.
Why?
Why do you think they're holding it?
Do you really think this is just cool looking?
No, there's reasons why they held onto these traditions.
This matters.
And you're thinking, what about the Romans?
That's Greek, right?
Well, the Romans have their own way of doing it.
The Romans have their staff that they call Elyseus.
And the Augors in the ancient world held these.
And the Augors did divinary with looking at birds, right?
And it's funny because the word cardinal is a Latin word that comes from these priests.
They named the red bird after the cardinals.
And it's interesting because the Augors used birds in their divination.
So you were like, is there something going on with that?
Maybe I'm just throwing it out there.
I'm just looking at things that I'm noticing.
Now, let's go to the next one.
There's your cardinal right there, that red bird, right?
That's augury stuff.
This is augury.
All right.
Now, Mithras, Lucifer, the invincible sun, the light bearer.
You see the torch bearers, the dataforiae.
There's actually a, if you look at the early Christ association groups, there was a branch.
There was a type of priest in the early Christian groups called the dataforiae.
Same name as the groups of Mithraic priests.
In fact, a lot of these old Mithraic temples were repurposed for Christian churches.
There's churches right now in use, not about old ruins.
People still attend churches today and in their basements are Mithraeums.
They're still there.
They're not getting rid of them.
They just keep them there.
And people will travel to go see these places, go look it up.
This is what they did.
They have a story about St. Demetrius from the fifth century, and he was one of the last
priests of the Ellosinian Mysteries, and the story goes, I don't know how true this is,
the story is that Deminer visited him and dreamed and told him the worship of Jesus.
She said, take all of my rights and put them on Jesus.
So we have like fifth, sixth century texts about co-opting the Ellosinian rights and
bringing it into the fold in Christianity.
We see this with Solendictus as well.
So you start seeing early apologetics going on where they're trying to figure out when Jesus was born.
And the only indication they have is they go up in the Gospel of Luke where it says that
when John was born, his father Zechariah was one of the priests of a sect called the Abijah,
which is the eighth division out of 24 divisions of priests.
His job is to go in just like I just talked about these are ancient rights.
The Orphics would light certain incense for certain gods for certain festivals.
Well, they do this and they do this in Israel.
They have certain priests from certain classes.
In the case of Zechariah, he was part of the Abijah, Abiyah, or how you pronounce it.
And they would twice, two weeks out of the year, it was their job to control the temple like these incense.
And so there's a little bit of indication on what time of the year he could have been there.
But anyways, it ends up being where you can kind of hone it into like a month period.
You could kind of pick.
There's some early accounts that say he might have been born on January 6th, conceived in April 6th or something like that.
And then there's later accounts when they start going, you can start seeing the early apologetics going,
huh, soul is on the rise.
Soul is the head of the pantheon now.
The Severan dynasty came along and they're implementing these ancient Armenian
slash Persian, Black Sea rites of Mithras, Solendictus.
And this is rising as I showed you with the Mithraeum everywhere.
And the Christians are looking at this and this is their main competitor of the time period.
And they're going, well, wouldn't it be better if Jesus wasn't born on January 6th and just made his birth on December 25th?
Ooh, that'll get some pagans to join us, right?
Which is what they did.
So continue with the slides.
And so you start seeing the, these making, you know, Jesus being born on December 25th.
And there's, there on the left, you see Selvanus, right?
That's, look at them.
Look at that image of Selvanus.
Look how Christ-like he looks.
You know what I mean?
You got your Mithraeum Kronos, right?
He's holding the two keys.
You know, the key, like Peter, the keys of the church, right?
There you have your Mithra born from the rock between the deoscharis surrounded by the Mithraic symbols.
There's your staffs with the serpents on them.
There's your stars there.
And then, then you have the, the bread of the cup of the Eucharist.
Okay.
That's universal.
You see that with Ellosinian mystery, so that with Solendictus mystery, so that Christianity, so that everywhere.
On the bottom, you can see there's another communion where they're all sitting at the table, like the Last Supper doing their thing.
Have it, you know, these are, these are ancient rites.
Okay.
And this isn't, everyone's getting this.
Everybody has their own version of this because this is how it was in the Bronze Age.
This is how it's passed down from generation to generation.
And as synchron, as these gods are being synced together through Roman imperial cult, you start seeing this.
This is a text called Saturnalia by Microbius.
And he, in this text, he says that Apollo and the sun are the same.
And afterwards taught that he was the father of Liber, Dionysus himself, who is Apollo.
And there was no doubt from these that the sun and Liber Dionysus are considered the father of the same deity.
Okay.
So if you go down, this is where it gets crazy, because you don't, you always hear this pushback on the whole December 25th birth of the son of the son of God thing.
Well, look what it says.
Look, look what Microbius is saying here that in the winter solstice, he's depicted as a small child.
Obviously, what that means is born on the winter solstice, such as the Egyptians bring forth that the editors on the certain day that a very short day.
As small and a child, he's born on the winter solstice.
And then his age is set at the summer solstice, when he attains his greatest height in the image of the beard.
And then from, from then on, diminu, diminuations, the God is represented as the fourth from an aging man.
Likewise in Thrace, this is the same.
Likewise in Thrace, the same is to be, we had to take the sun and Liberus, who they call subasius.
There he is.
There's subasius, Black Sea God, right where the same area is Medea.
All right.
If we continue, we'll see it says, and the sun is in the upper that is in the daytime hemisphere, Apollo is in vote.
All right.
And in the underworld, that is that night Dionysus, father of the book is held.
That's where I got that read.
It says up there, Apollo and the sun are the same.
And Liber is also so Dionysus basically what he's getting at here.
Okay.
He's saying Dionysus, Apollo, subasius, pan, whatever you want to call him.
This is the son of God.
He's born on the winter solstice.
That's because that's when the sun is at its smallest.
That's when the sky, you could see the sun.
Right now we're at the time where it's the shortest days of the year.
It's cold out.
It's the winter solstice time.
That's what this period is.
And so let's go to the next one.
It's the time of the year where the birth, the sun is happening.
The sun is being born.
And so here we go.
This is the crazy part.
This is what I wanted to get to.
He calls him Ya-oh.
So Macrobius, after explaining the rights of Saturnalia and why we do Saturnalia,
why we give gifts every year at this time, why we shut down our businesses,
why we held our New Year's Festival at the Kalins of Janus.
And he says, all these characters that we find in these mythologies are all Ya-oh.
He says it right here.
The sacred verses is called Ya-oh.
For Apollo, Clare is consulted, which one of these gods should be considered who is called the Ya-oh.
Now, you know, if you've watched my videos, you see in the Chaldean oracles,
they say, Bacchus is Ya-oh.
They'll say there's a triad.
And you see this with the early Christians, especially the Valentinians,
where they say, like, you don't have Trinitarian theology until like the fourth century, fifth century,
where they actually institute the Trinity.
But the early Gnostics were already way ahead of them.
And they said that, you know, Jesus, who is the Christ in the Logos,
is in a triad with Zoe.
You were talking about Zoe earlier.
Zoe is called Sophia, wisdom.
And they're in a triad with the one.
The one who is Phonies, the one that created, self-created God, right?
And that's what these early Christians were saying.
And this is, now you have a pagan saying, Ya-oh is this God.
So there's complete overlap.
He cites Orpheus.
Likewise, Orpheus, I'll read the part before that.
The power of this oracle and the interpretation of the numbers and names
by which the book, the Father and the Son, Ya-oh, are signified,
was executed by Cornelius Labius in the book called On the Oracle of Apollo Clarius.
Likewise, Orpheus demonstrating that Liberty and the Son are one and the same God.
And he cites the passage and goes through how this is like, these are ancient Orphic ideas.
And so there is no escaping Orphic inspiration in these ancient mystery rites.
Eucharists, baptisms, these are all initiations for the ancient mysteries.
So that's that.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
Oh my God, I need to go take a cold shower.
That was so good.
Oh, and by the way, Ya-oh might be wondering, that's not the same as Yahweh.
It is.
The oldest Septuagint copies that we have.
So whatever Septuagint copy you think is the oldest is not.
You're thinking of a church text called the Codex Sinaiticus,
or the Codex Alexandricus, or the Codex Vaticanus.
Those are the three big church texts.
All of those are produced three 25 or later.
So between three 25 and 400, they start producing these big church texts
where they take the Septuagint Old Testament.
It's altered.
And the reason why we know it's heavily altered is because we found fragments,
Greek fragments of the Old Testament from Alexandria.
And instead of in a lot of places in that text where it's supposed to say Yahweh,
it says Ya-oh in the exact same spelling that you just saw in the Saturnalia.
So it's that same God that Bacchus is named after in the Chaldean oracles
where they say another name for Bacchus is Yah-oh.
So Plutarch turns out to be correct in what he's talking about.
He's not just throwing this up out of his ass.
Plutarch is looking at texts that call Bacchus Yah-oh,
and the Septuagint is using this God called Yah-oh.
So he's not just making this up.
He's citing texts from the time period.
You see people.
You see what happens when you give an angry person a club of truth.
You see what happens when they pick up that evidence.
Listen to how many sources.
Just listen to how many sources.
Gnostic just went through.
Oh, my God.
I just heard one after another.
I was like, oh, irrefutable.
Nobody can stand up to that.
Nobody.
You're swinging that lightsaber.
Like it's red and you want to cut somebody in half.
Yeah.
I'm saying my weapon is the sources.
I just go to the sources.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a beautiful training, people.
How lucky we are that, you know,
Neil can jump in and can do all the source work
so that there's no question.
Listen to what he's talking about.
This revolutionary.
I don't know if people heard it, but that's revolutionary.
Right?
That is a different view of history than any of us have had.
Yeah.
Definitely.
And from the mouths of the people who were living it.
Good God.
You can't get any more authentic than the Bible scholars.
Neil, you will take them and you will do things to them that
are so naughty and so gratifying at the same time.
Oh, God, I love it.
I love it.
And that's good.
I want to say this too, because those two religions that you see
in the time of Constantine, by the way,
Julian the Apostate is a nephew of Constantine.
He's from the same dynasty as Constantine.
Originally, these two religions supposed to coexist.
And they sort of mirror each other.
One of them is Christianity where it tries to separate itself
from everyone else.
They're like the ancient hipsters.
We're different than everybody.
Oh, you like all that mainstream Apollo stuff.
We're different.
We don't look.
We have different.
We have Jesus.
But it's really, they're just a bunch of hipster douches, right?
You know that hipster douche that everyone knows that tries
to listen to different music than everyone else.
You've never heard this.
Only I know this song.
That's type of crap, right?
That's what they were like.
But the rights of Mithras and Sol Invictus was another form
of this ancient syncretist religion where you see both
Vedic and Hellenistic traits coming from that part,
that Armenia, Cappadocia, you know, the place where Medea was.
And a lot of this stuff finds its way into the Roman religion.
And this was the ancient Roman religion.
And let's not forget.
Let's not forget that Medea is called Mitra.
So the connections there are unbelievably tight.
When Julius Caesar walks his scrawny bottom up to the temple
of Venus, Genetrix, which if you know Rome, you've got to
understand this is like the cult that everybody who has
Roman blood, this is their cult.
This is the great mother, the Genetrix, the producer
of our people.
This is our mother.
You're talking about our mother.
He walks into her temple and he dedicates a portrait
by some famous Greek dude of Medea.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's crazy.
But so Julius Caesar, Augustus, they're venerating Medea.
You see that.
And they're not bringing this out up for the first time
in Rome because you go back to the Etruscans and there's
Medea there.
Medea is all over the place.
And she's a big deal.
These ancient rites that these Orphics are passing down are
if you want to call it Pulaski, and I like that word
because it covers, it's not just Greece.
It's also the Black Sea.
It's also Northern Turkey or that region, Armenia.
It goes, it's where you get this, it's where you see a lot
of the derivatives of this ancient, you see this with the
Shavites, the Shavites, I think I pronounced it right,
with Shiva.
There's like an Eastern Dionysus going on.
And this is the God that represented by the Soma drink
in the Persian religion.
They call it the Haoma.
And it's the God of the vine.
It's the God of the drugs that possesses you.
And then the Greeks, you see, it's Dionysus.
So it's the Kaikuan, Kaikian.
And so you see the same rites in their respective languages,
you know, tweaked in their own little way, but ultimately
it's these rites that are passed down from the Bronze Age,
being kept intact all the way up until the Middle Ages
when Christianity and Solon Vic is the last two.
But not just, it's not really, they're not the last two
because you have, the word pagan comes from, it means like rustic,
like people on the outside, in the inner cities, you have all
these overeducated, you know, ivory tower, sort of nerd,
orthic, Pythagorean, middle Platonist, stoic people that
think they're smarter than everyone else and they have
religion figured out and they have, they look at, they read
Plato and get their theology from Plato.
But outside of that, in the countryside, they have these rustic
worshipers of Pan that don't give a shit about any of that stuff.
They just want to, they just follow what they're, what they
were brought down from their parents and their grandparents
and they're keeping these rites alive.
They don't care what the new philosophy is of the day.
That's, those are the people that I love.
That's why they call them pagans.
Think of the billbillies.
That's what they call them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Think of the farm girls.
Imagine the farm girls that, what do they do?
They're all tatted up and partially shaved and they go out
on the weekends at certain times a year and they get, they get
into groups, don't get caught.
If you get caught, they'll fucking, oh, excuse me.
Oh, I can't believe that's the first time I said that.
They'll catch you and they'll kill you.
And this is their pagan way.
This is their pagan way.
Imagine those, imagine those types.
And I was talking to another academic about this.
It was so hard to get rid of them.
Cause you weren't going to do, you're going to slaughter
all, you can't do that.
That's, I mean, so they have to co-op them somehow.
They have to tell them stories.
Deminers showed up in a dream and told, and told Demetrius
to worship Jesus.
So you guys should do it.
It's totally cool.
Oh, we have a saint named Orpheus now.
And you look, he plays a liar, just like Orpheus does.
You see him trying to co-op them in different ways
throughout different centuries.
Cause they won't ever, ever to go away.
They're always, they're always living on the country side,
always, all the way through the, through the middle ages
and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
You always have the small minority of pagans living
somewhere.
They survived.
You can see it.
You can see that pagan influence come through when Rome's
like, maybe we should start worshiping the Phrygian mother.
Why?
Cause an oracle told you dumbasses to do it.
Right.
And you see the Phrygian mother influencing the virgin mother.
And those are the Cappadocian Phrygian church fathers.
If you look at their tombstones, we're just looking,
we were just looking at one from not to one of the early
church fathers.
I can't remember his name.
It starts with an A and his tombstone doesn't even have
the word Jesus or Christ on there once.
All it is, is venerating the Holy Virgin mother.
Like, is that, that's what they, that was synonymous with God.
The earliest Christians are just the Holy Virgin mother,
gave me life, gave me Zoe.
And this was, this is on the early church fathers,
Jesus isn't on there and Christ isn't on there.
And this is a big tombstone with like 500 words.
No Jesus, no Christ, the Holy Virgin mother is all you get.
What is that?
I mean, that says something about these early Phrygian
Cappadocian church fathers.
Yeah.
And you mentioned earlier, you mentioned earlier that,
you know, it's really these Black Sea peoples in the,
you know, north of Turkey, modern day Turkey,
who are passing on this culture down into Asia Minor
through the trading and through the business.
It's where all the pirates come from.
The southern coast of the Black Sea is where Alexander,
the false prophet, you know, famous,
it's where he ends up going to start his,
start his mystery.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you got Cappadocia's wedged right in between
the Persians and the Romans.
That's where you see this blending happening
and you see Sebasius.
That's the home of Sebasius.
And even Clement of Alexander is saying,
Sebasius is a counter sign,
because the way Sebasius was worshiped,
it's like Zeus and Dionysus rolled into one.
It's like a Godhead, like Jesus and the Father, right?
And Clement's looking at this and Clement's saying,
this is a counter sign of the mysteries of Christ, right?
He's saying, they're copying Jesus.
That's what he's saying.
And Justin Marley uses the same apologetic crap,
where he tries to say, oh, Mithras, he says,
what does he say?
He says, you know, how Hermes is called the logos,
all that stuff that looks like Jesus, it's not.
They're copying us.
You want to know why they have to say that?
Because they don't have a choice,
because they know it's either one way or the other.
So they have to argue for that side,
because they don't have a choice.
They know that these son of God rights
are being applied to Jesus.
It's the other way around.
So that's where you start.
You see, apologetics starts off early.
Apologetics is not a modern thing that you just see today,
where you see people being called apologists
online or on Twitter.
No, no, no.
Christian apologetics started from day one.
You don't see pagan apologetics.
You don't see, they don't care.
They're not trying to win.
You're either initiated or you're not.
You know what I mean?
You're either a bucket or you're not.
It's not really like that.
You were talking a little bit earlier.
You mentioned a couple of points that I wanted to bring up
that were super strong areas like gold.
You just mentioned Macrobius.
And let me give a plug to Macrobius.
Get out there and take a look at him.
You want to see some of that real cult stuff.
You know what I mean?
That's where it is.
Beautiful, marvelous source.
There's one.
I want to send people to one.
Drakontius.
Nobody reads Drakontius.
Playwright, right?
Playwright.
He's not technically a playwright.
He's a dude who's exercising himself
by writing very short little playlets.
Yeah, I think more of a grammarian than anything else.
You know, anywho, you've got to see some of the titles that he uses.
The people of Rome understood.
For example, they call Medea scutha.
Right?
What is that from?
It's from the fact that she's working in that region as the queen.
Right?
Again, it's the thing you mentioned that was so important
that people I think need to hear is the Bacchic Empire.
You can watch this thing.
How are they promoting and pushing the power of the Bacchic Empire?
It's with the oracles.
With the oracles.
This system of oracles is consistent throughout Europe,
throughout the Mediterranean, right?
All over North Africa.
The Sybil.
Yeah.
They combine.
That's what happens in Alexandria.
They're taking all these texts from these different Sybils
and putting them all into one book.
That's kind of where you get the Judeo-Christian religion from.
It comes from the Sybiline tradition.
That's why you see all these prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah.
It's all destruction.
God's going to come and destroy you.
That's what you get in the Sybiline oracles, you know?
The guy who wrote the Torah and other parts in the third century,
that guy is borrowing so heavily from everything around.
I didn't mention it tonight, Gnostic, but I want to ask you this.
I want to ask you this.
They've got how many, how many of those gems do they carry?
How many of those sacred stones do they carry?
Do you know what the lithica has?
It has the powers.
It has the powers of the stones from the Bronze Age
before there was Moses, before there was Abraham,
before there was anybody proposed it wise.
This is ancient history.
That's what they call it, Zodiacal Perfection, the 12.
You see that all across the board.
It's just obvious.
Sybiline oracles, this is not even a secret,
because the Sybiline oracles are still continuing to be written
by Christians all the way into the 15th century,
where they talk about the fall of Constantinople going to happen.
They didn't even hide that the tradition comes from the Sybiline text.
They called the first Christian Sybilis, right?
That's what Kelsus was saying.
When he starts listing off the groups of Christians,
the first thing he says, they're called Sybilis,
they're called Simonians, Marcianites.
He lists the Sybilis first.
You know how you read the back of an ingredient
and it starts with the biggest ingredients first,
and it'll say like, oh, sugar, citric acid, blah, blah, blah.
Whatever the most of it is, he's always listed first.
That's how you do stuff.
He said Sybilis first before he said anything else.
That says something about the tradition of Christianity
where it comes out of.
It comes out of that Alexandrian middle Platonist world,
Stoics and Platonist clashing.
That's what is theology.
It's Greek.
This is what amazes me.
I met somebody who's a theology PhD who even he said,
I'm surprised I even have a theology degree.
They should just call my degree something else
because we don't learn any theology and we don't learn any Greek.
He said, I don't know anything about Presocratics.
I don't know anything about Plato, but I'm a theology PhD.
That's like calling yourself a surgeon
and not knowing how to use a scalpel.
Like, what's going on?
Like, how do you do that?
Funny. It's hilarious, Neil.
I can't believe that you're in that milieu
that you're able to smell that funk.
I love that. Isn't that amazing?
I'm going to smell it on any guests that ever come
in the future on your show.
I'm going to smell them before they come in.
Did you, I just want people,
I want the Satanic congregation to recognize
the use of source work here.
See, there's no ideas.
Neil didn't dream this up.
He didn't sit around and say,
hmm, what kind of book can I write
to make myself some frigging money and status?
He didn't do that.
He's just going, look, look at the sources.
And he can give you an accurate picture, right?
That other people who are so-called scholars
can't keep up with, right?
Let's give Neil the kudos that he deserves.
He, you know, I'm going to say this, Neil.
You told me this in confidence,
but I don't think you'd mind me saying it.
Some other who saw somewhere else with a degree
and a professorship said, wow,
how is, how is Gnostic Informance so well-informed
in the sources, right?
As if it belongs to them.
As if they can take these materials
and make whatever they want
and put stupid ideas in your head
when somebody who's ronin' from the outside comes in.
It's a huge threat.
Look, look what your audience is way bigger than theirs.
Well, because they in a hundred years ago,
a hundred years ago,
if you were living in the time of France,
or, you know, whatever,
Carl Jung or somebody,
you had to be,
you had to go to university to get books.
You're not going on Amazon.
You're not reading them online.
And now everybody has the power.
You can go online.
You can get a Greek tutor on Wizzent.
You can learn Greek and Hebrew.
You can learn everything you want from your computer.
And you can read the text.
They're all translated.
You have, people have no,
you don't need to pay $40,000 to be,
to learn this stuff.
Maybe if you want to be an expertise in one specific area,
then go ahead.
Knock yourself out.
Go in debt for the rest of your life.
But if you just want,
like you don't have to do,
you don't have to go in debt to learn this stuff.
I'm just saying,
I don't call myself an expert in anything,
but I will say I'm pretty confident in like,
basic understanding of a lot of these subjects.
You know?
Yeah.
You can tell them,
Neil, next time you talk to anybody
that you want to flash your badge,
you tell them you officially have a master's degree
from Satanic you.
Very good.
And if you want them to play with you in the sources,
you welcome them in.
And then Neil, Neil, you never,
you never lighten up.
When you go in,
you smash the hell out of them.
Do you understand?
You take that ground and you show them,
this is my dojo.
You know what I mean?
You show them,
show them the way.
And you can do that with the sources.
Everybody sees that tonight.
Look,
there are a lot of BS artists out there.
There are a lot of people with degrees
and with titles
that you and I don't have.
And those people will tell you this is the way it was.
And all you got to do is watch.
Look what,
look what Neil did with the sword tonight.
He slayed.
He totally slayed.
He gave a picture of antiquity
that was razor sharp.
And Neil, I could taste it.
I was getting all riled up,
kind of aroused by the whole situation,
you know, intellectually speaking.
And to see Paul cite Medea is pretty,
pretty hilarious because you can't escape.
There is no escaping.
If you're writing in Greek,
and even,
even just not even just the quote,
that's from Medea,
even just writing words in Greek,
you're going to start,
you're going to run into the technical cultic terms
like Eucharist or Baptist.
Stuff that you find in the Ellisonian Mysteries
and the Mithraic Mysteries,
Samlethration Mysteries,
all this stuff comes from this.
How many times has Paul talked about mystery?
The word mystery itself
comes from the ancient mystery rights.
It didn't mean,
it didn't mean like solve a riddle of a,
of a novel in that mystery,
the religion,
that's what it meant.
That's what that word meant.
How many preachers out there?
Do you think Neil,
or how many priests and preachers know
that Paul quoted Medea?
How, how many do you think?
Not many.
They think it was,
because they're,
most of them know about Epimenides,
but they know Epimenides was citing Medea.
Zero.
I'll bet you,
I'll bet you every,
I'll bet my degree
against every degree
at Dallas Theological Seminary.
Do you hear me?
I left Dallas Theological Seminary
because their Greek program was so bad.
You were there?
Yes, I started.
I started.
What year was this?
In their THD program.
Oh, I think it was the early 90s.
I enrolled in their THD program.
I'm just trying to imagine
you in Dallas Theological Seminary.
The first day I got there,
the first day I got there,
this guy who lived on the same floor,
came in and he was like,
can I sit down?
I was like, sure, brother,
go ahead.
And he said,
can you tell me your secret sins?
Oh, wow.
And I was like, no, man,
I got some Greek to study.
I think that's one of the institutions
where you have to sign.
I know the SPL does this,
but I think they do it too,
where you have to sign the Statement of Faith.
Well, of course.
The Statement of Faith is like,
you will preach Jesus Christ was crucified
and rose in the third day.
You're signing that for your degree?
Yeah.
They still do that in 2023.
Yeah.
I didn't get that far.
It's all mind-blowing.
I didn't get that far though.
I don't think you would have agreed to that, would you?
Even back in the 90s, you probably would have.
No, but I was getting so.
You see, I had had a bachelor's in classics by this point.
Yeah.
So although I'd love Jesus Christ
and wanted to continue my mission work
and go through Dallas Seminary,
the classics was rooting itself in my brain.
And after a while, I was like,
look, their Greek sucks here.
They do weird stuff.
It's kind of touchy-feely weird.
Biblical Greek?
Biblical Greek?
What's that?
Well, you should learn Biblical Greek.
You're stuck in this box.
It's only Greek terms that are you found in the New Testament
or Septuagint, right?
So you don't actually go outside
and find out where these words mean
and what the etymologies are, where they come from.
Do they come from Orpheus?
Do they come from Plato?
Do they come from Homer?
You're looking at it saying,
oh, this word shows up in the Septuagint
and now it's being used in the New Testament.
So it only can mean these certain things.
You're stuck in the box.
Biblical Greek, what's that?
Yeah.
I had a bachelor's degree in Greek and Latin.
It was in the classics department, right?
And it was in Greek and Latin.
I double majored, right?
I did both.
And what was funny was going from that
at a major university,
I went to the University of Arizona
and the Wildcats.
And anyway, after getting that technical exposure,
I was able to go to seminary and see right away.
I mean, the world that they live in
with their language is so unscientific.
I have students come to me from biblical classes.
They've got to do so much biblical Greek, right?
And I get them and I have to sit them down.
I have to reprogram them.
And I say, look, this is a science.
So you can stop messing around
and you can learn the fundamentals, right?
And I can take somebody like that
and train out the bad that seminary gives them.
But it all comes down to Acts again,
the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
When the people saw them talk,
when they saw Peter and John talk,
they said they're two things.
Number one, they're illiterate.
And number two, they're stupid.
Right.
And they said,
I went to Dallas Theological Seminary.
The one passage I left.
And that's what I found at Dallas Theological Seminary.
It reminds me of the passages where they walk up to Paul,
the Stoics and Epicureans are sitting in Athens.
I'm picturing them with their beards like mine right now
and they're wearing their togas.
And these are some strange notions you bring to our ears.
Tell us more.
And then it says he told them more
and some of them were like, oh, I got to go.
And only if you stayed behind.
And I'm laughing because I'm like, this is probably true.
This sounds like a true text.
I think that part is historical.
That's a funny text.
It's like Paul is sitting there in Athens going,
I want to tell you about Jesus.
And they all walk up and say, huh?
This is some strange notions you bring to our ears.
Go on.
Go on, sir.
Tell us.
Well, he resurrected.
Oh, I got to go.
I'm out of here.
And he's looking around at the statues
and he sees one of them says to an unknown God.
And it's probably Theo's hipstose, right?
The unnamed God.
And he's looking around saying, that's him.
That's ours.
We have the same one.
So funny.
I don't know.
That's how I read that part.
And people think, Neil, that this guy Paul is a genius.
Oh, this is the author of the Romans.
And they talk about him like, who, huh?
Dude, I've read lots of classical authors.
Lots of people before Paul and after Paul.
And I can tell you for a fact,
I wouldn't put Paul in the top 60, 70 authors
that I know from antiquity who could, you know,
whose works make his look kind of like brainwashing.
Yeah, he's crazy.
Yeah.
He's out of his mind talking about, yeah,
you need the gnosis.
You need to, he says in Corinthians, gnosis,
speaking in tongues and prophesying.
If you don't have, you have to have all three,
but if you don't have all three, you gotta have faith too.
And if you don't have faith, then you don't have all three.
But if you have all three and you have faith, then you're good.
Sounds like he's going crazy when you read it.
When you read Corinthians, it sounds like someone going crazy.
You know he's being backed by the purple, right?
He's got Lydia and all the backing that he needs for that.
So, okay, I understand.
That's what's financing what he's doing.
But I think he was bringing those good eastern drugs to the Greeks.
And that's why they're like, yeah.
All right, we'll fund your project.
Come on in.
Come to Corinthians and start the church here.
Bring some of that good Egyptian, some good Arabian,
you know, whatever you got.
He was pushing the venom.
He was pushing the viper venom, baby.
I mean,
He's having visions of the seventh heaven.
He's, you know, he's dancing.
You know what that means.
You and I know what that means.
Yeah.
Yeah, the angel came to him.
Yeah, the angel came to him.
He's floating up to the seventh heaven, he said,
or the third heaven, he said.
Yeah.
All right, we know how you got there.
There's only one way to get there.
There's only one way to get to the third heaven,
to float up to the third heaven.
And what's funny is people who follow the fairy tale.
I mean, think about somebody trying to make sense of it.
What do you think is just happening naturally?
Think of a very simple minded person.
Somebody who's really concrete, really down to earth
and just straightforward, right?
And Paul says, I got boosted up to the so and so heaven.
And there I was.
And right.
And what is this person trying to,
did you see him get struck by the snake?
That thing didn't hurt him.
He's got, this guy's pushing the thorn.
That's what they call it.
This guy's pushing the thorn.
Right.
So he's one of those frigging pirates.
Yeah.
Remember we looked up the buckthorn in Greek, the accounta.
And then it said like acacia roots as,
on the bottom on what we call, what's the website?
Perseus Tufts.
It defined that exact drug as acacia.
Like that's DMT right there.
That's crazy.
I didn't even know that until,
that's why I love that website.
But Paul, yeah.
And I think whoever wrote James,
they say it's James or whoever or someone else,
maybe that wrote James, whatever.
Whatever the case is.
I'll just say James.
James just says, text says James.
I'm just going to call it James.
Anyways, whoever wrote that was responding to Paul,
talking shit and saying,
you don't know what you're talking about, dude.
All your shit about faith cares.
He goes, even demons have faith.
Who gives a shit about faith?
I love that text, dude.
Was he the one,
one of those James has got thrown off the Temple Mount.
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah.
What do you have to do at work
to piss people off so much
they throw you out of the building?
I don't know.
Any ideas?
Probably super high.
Probably probably just bothering everybody
for being too high.
Here we go.
Here's the text right here.
I'm sharing my screen on the right.
You can pull it up.
He says, you believe that there's one God.
Good.
Even demons believe that.
Like, it's basically like the way it's supposed to be written,
the way it's supposed to be.
This is supposed to be sarcastic, the good part.
So tell me this, Neil.
Tell me, because I really want to expand on this
and then I'm going to call it.
The Bacchic Empire,
as you're reading all of these sources
and you're finding out that there's all of this,
you kind of get the sense of what Bacchic worship is,
hits this area at this time, hits thieves, hits Rome.
Any...
Oh, Baptists, too.
There's an organization.
Yes, and the Baptists is part of it.
It's all part of the same movement.
There's an organization to this, isn't it?
That people are not...
I think the oracular structure is what's keeping,
because those oracles are the ones
that are given orders to say,
go do this colony.
Yes, you can go to war.
Even when Athens is fighting with Sparta,
as late as that, right?
Classical Greece.
What happens?
It's all oracles, right?
They're generals.
It's always women that perform the oracles.
Yeah, those generals are listening to the oracles.
Isn't that funny how in the ancient world,
we always talk about patriarchy
and how women don't have roles in these religions,
modern Islam and Christianity.
In the ancient world, they had ordained women
in these high roles of high priestesses,
handling the snakes, the serpents,
and handling the drugs,
and giving the oracles to these kings
and these generals, telling them what to do.
They were way ahead of their time.
I'm telling you, democracy, all that stuff.
Athena, the image of Athena, Minerva.
You go to Independence Hall in Pennsylvania
or in Washington, D.C.,
and you see Minerva, Lady Liberty.
That's all ancient democracy from Athens.
They were way ahead of their time.
You know what I mean?
You think we'll be able to keep that all in with this?
Final question.
Thank you for coming tonight.
This has been absolutely wonderful.
Final question for you.
What makes you rap with this?
Tell me now you told us everything about the past.
Tell me now about the present and the immediate future.
Are we going to be able to keep liberty
or is the government going to be challenged and overthrown?
We're keeping it.
Because I know that liberty always prevails.
Look at history.
Even if there's some dark ages that rise up,
eventually, Athena always wins.
That's what I'll say.
That's my oracle.
As long as we recognize that we can go backwards,
that it is possible, and funny thing is,
this happens when groups like,
I don't know, who did it in the third and fourth century?
Christians.
When the Christians challenged the government,
they were able to get a person to endorse them.
A desperate guy named Constantine.
I think he had orange hair.
He said, I am now part of the whole key row society.
What happened?
Everyone is like, what the?
Julian that you mentioned tonight,
the Christians, you have to understand people out there.
Julian, the emperor that Neil mentioned tonight.
Try to save the world.
Try to save the world.
Try to save civilization.
I got to say this,
because the way the Christians treated the Jews
for 1,500 years was real rough.
Orcing them into ghettos,
basically treating them secondhand,
they weren't Roman citizens.
They had to be treated like animals, right?
Julian, who wanted to bring the ancient rights back,
said, is Jerusalem belongs to the Jews?
He wanted to build the temple again.
That's in the sources.
So this guy really did want to keep the world back
into its balance and where it was supposed to be.
He said that.
Yahweh, that's Israel.
Let them have their God.
Let Alexandria be ruled by Serapis.
Let Athens be ruled by Athena.
He had this system that he was envisioned
what it's supposed to be.
That's true.
You got to give him credit,
especially since all of his male relatives
were executed by the Christians
when he was just a tiny kid.
The only reason he was alive was
it would look too bad if they killed a child.
Sometimes we can walk over that line.
It makes us all queasy.
Your vote is we keep Lady Liberty here.
We follow justice.
We shed the blood of tyrants
onto the Tree of Liberty
to make our republic stand.
Your sister, Ro, who do I get to be?
I want to find out who I am.
I'm a sister, Ro.
Are you coming with the opposite?
No, I want to be with you.
I want to keep the republic.
Brutus.
You got your dagger. You're Brutus.
Sister Ro and Brutus.
I'm glad you said that.
I was hoping you would say that
because I think they were on the right.
Caesar, whatever.
He's a great general
and the emperor,
but he was on the wrong side of history.
That's my opinion.
Sister Ro was on the right side of history.
That's my opinion.
I've read a lot of the sources.
I'm a big fan of Lucian Civil War
and a big fan of Sister Ro.
I'm a big fan of Diodorus
and Ovid
and Cassie's Dio
and all these great Virgil.
My come away with that time period
was Sister Ro tried to save the republic
and that was the way to go.
Who knows what could have happened
if something intact.
He was trying.
He put himself
between their past
republic
and this wave of imperialism
that ultimately
wiped him out.
They couldn't.
When you make your central power so powerful
that they can do anything,
as soon as you get someone in there
with no limits,
everything's going to crumble.
A government like that
is to keep fighting wars.
You got to get
allegiance out there.
You got to take more land.
That's the only way to keep that type of system going.
That's why they call it the Dark Ages
and the Middle Ages is all
the Ostrogoths, the Vandals,
the Huns,
all warrior cultures
trying to kill each other over
kingdoms and land.
When you have a republic
with a
Senate that represents
the people at large,
you balance the power out more.
Thomas Jefferson
and Thomas Paine
they realized this
after the Enlightenment.
Those Greeks had it figured out.
Nietzsche was big into the Greeks.
We have to go back to what they were doing.
This is the only way.
All this Holy Roman Empire crap
that's got to go.
You either are living
as a serf
or you're a billionaire living in a church,
like a trillionaire,
equated to today's money.
That's what they were, these high cardinals
and bishops living in...
They're the only ones that enjoyed life.
Life was only good if you were one of those people.
To anyone else, life sucked.
I hate this new thing
that historians do now.
They'll say, the Dark Ages
is as dark as we thought.
It was actually pretty good. For who?
For fucking who? I hate that shit.
I push back against that.
I don't care. I still call it the Dark Ages.
I'm going to keep continuing to call it that.
Prove it otherwise.
Scotland.
Edinburgh has a wonderful museum
of
the middle-aged torture devices
that are used to extract
information from people.
If your group
is into that, if your brotherhood
is into beating
and abusing people,
this is a good place for it.
No, thank you very much, Middle Ages.
I think I'd rather
fly with the people
who talked about the Golden Age.
You know what they said?
The Romans said their Golden Age was?
It was the Pax Romana.
It was that time
when those doors were shut
and there aren't wars.
Right? How do you bring
that civilization?
That's what Lucan gets at in his Pharsalia
where he emphasizes
it's the time of peace
when people
are happy.
During times of war, it's just death
and sadness and depression.
Nothing good comes from war.
That's why I see these idiots on Twitter
with their Alexander the Great
thumbnails
and they'll say like, Christian warrior
and they're like, look how
based it was back in ancient Rome
and they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
None of these people ever had to
take a spear
or a stat.
They had no idea what it was like.
Homer made it clear
war is not that great.
It sucks. Read the Iliad.
Homer describes
what happens when
Ajax throws a spear
and it goes through somebody
and they start to break out
and they lose their consciousness
and then they're gone.
Homer writes that out very vividly.
Homer is trying to tell you war is not fun
and Achilles was
the symbol of
how war
can really
tear people apart.
Achilles has to kill Hector
and my father has to grieve for his son.
That's why
they call this text divine because it's so true.
Yeah.
Mars lays down with Venus.
Right?
That's the thing.
That's that Roman ideal.
That's that triad.
To get to that.
To get to that perfect civilization.
That was the dream
of the seven hills.
And that stuff was appropriated
through time and used.
The Christians have used those
images for centuries
and distorted them
just like Julian said.
He said they're going to distort everything.
It turns out they did.
So that the images that we get
their Bible times
are just totally.
Come on. Who believes
any of that stuff anymore?
Can you? Oh my god.
I won't start because we've been long enough.
Thank you.
Neil, I'm going to give you
a last chance to comment here.
Thank you for coming on
Satanic Initiation.
Glad to have you before the show's over.
I want to tell people
Wednesday, our very last
show will be a
I will sum up.
I'll give you the attorney
for the Transdimensional Authority.
I'll sum up
with the charges against Jesus
and then I will give
us a chance to come to a
verdict via you
and whether it will be
a poll or whether we'll just be scanning
the chance. Either way
it should be fun and we'll have
a little bit of fun and I'll end up with a few
comments. Just a way
of thanking you and
for being involved and thank you
Neil and you've got the last
word tonight on Satanic Initiation.
Hail Satan. Hail Satan.
I'm working on a video right now
about this time of the year
for Winter Solstice
Saturnalia. This time
of the year is a special time of the year to
magical time of the year and
there's light in the darkness.
You know,
Hanukkah, the idea of Hanukkah
where they light the menorah, the light in the darkness.
This is that solstice time
of the year.
So I'm
working on a video that I'm done
with the script and I'm recording it now
and I'll be editing it. It'll be out in the next
week probably five, six days
and it's about this time of the year
and this certain rights. It goes back to
Haola,
Haola. The ancient
Greeks had a Bacchic Festival
during this time of the year. Before the
Romans did Saturnalia, the Greeks had a
different winter festival
dedicated to Bacchus. That's in the video.
Solendictus stuff,
Saturnalia stuff,
some of the
Christian ideas.
It's all about, the whole video is going to be about
the ancient festivals
and the showing the sources of what they said
about this time of the year. Interesting
shit. The Egyptians had
temples built that would mark
the sun and the sky and there's fascinating
shit. The sun would line up in a certain
place during the winter solstice.
Cool shit.
That's what's coming next.
Gorgeous, gorgeousness
and gorgeosity all wrapped up.
Love it, I love it.
