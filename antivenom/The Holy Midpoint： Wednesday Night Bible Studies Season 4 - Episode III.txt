Drinking whiskey, when that whisky's burned through my veins
Indians go crazy and the Scotsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see you've got your selling and you got your drinking whiskey
Oh yeah, drinking whiskey
Oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Wednesday night Bible studies
We're going to be spending a little bit of our time with Juno tonight
As you can see, as you can see Juno say hello
Juno's been with us for quite a while
So she is quite interested in the studies
Thank you for coming
Tonight we're going to push further into the Mithraic Liturgy
So-called, we're going to see what the actual liturgy is
And we're going to push one level deeper into that mystery
We're also going to take a look tonight at the midpoint in this journey
And we are going to celebrate the midpoint with a few comments
A few comments, a little time for me to answer questions
We'll call some of them questions from evangelicals
That's tonight on Lady Babylon
So, we're going to begin tonight with a couple of comments that people have sent in
And I just want to let people be a sounding board here
And let's hear what they're saying
Can you bring the first one up Chewie? Thanks
Oh, fantastic
I'm obviously not Christian
But Amen is not a valuable source for a lot of classics information
Yes, the Christian church has done a lot of harm to people
Don't get me started on Christianity's harm to indigenous peoples in my country
But you do not need to falsify what happened in the Bible to present that position
There are ulterior motives on Amen's part
He has a vendetta not only because of the harms that Christianity has done
But because he was kicked out of teaching at Christian schools
For inappropriate behavior
I.e. putting a dildo in a play with children as audiences
There are better ways to fight against the abuses of Christianity
Than building a cult of hate
That was from Dark Celestial Witch
That was from Dark Celestial Witch
Dark Celestial Witch, thank you for your time
Thank you for paying attention
And thank you for your input
Yes, when the group that critiques reviews classical scholars
Upcoming and already coming
Called Brynmar
When they critique the chemical muse
They said this is a dangerous book
Amen obviously has ulterior motives
Ulterior motives
These are ulterior motives floating around
I love it
I love ulterior motives, why wouldn't I?
Yes, the problem is we want the text Divine Dark Witch
And so we're going to those texts whether anybody likes it or not
So truly it's the material
It's the material that cuts so sharply
It's the reason that you cannot be 100% faithful to that muse
Muse of antiquity and still sell yourself
Within a system that is designed to sell
Yes, but hey, we look for the pure source
We look for the pure source
And next comment please
Let's do another one
This is good, it's good feedback
Nearly a full hour in before the kid got naked in the garden
Well done, Amen
Personal record, thank you, yes
I'm glad that you've noticed I tried to mention that naked kid quite frequently
It's a full hour, I don't know what happened that night
Let's go on to the last comment please
Amen's past with the Christian hierarchy
Oh this sounds, it already sounds good
Listen to it, it sounds like a historian slash psychologist
Slash expert in the Inquisition
Amen's past with the Christian hierarchy
It's just a tinge, just a tinge of arrogance
Love it, love is my religion
Do you have a name?
Love is my religion has resulted in building hatred towards Jesus
Condemn the excessiveness
But you have no understanding says love is my religion
Of Jesus' teachings
You are filled with hatred and negativity
Remember what we have to, the way that we have to walk as Satanists
Is always facing reality
Always facing reality
We need to dive into this work
If nothing else based upon the resistance
The resistance is there to do so
We are reconstructing the mystery and of course
Of course it's going to make people afraid
We're here on warrant, right?
We have an indictment against this guy
In how many parallel universes?
Yes, there's an indictment always ending up in the garden
Always ending up in the garden with the boy
Yes, bring that last comment up one more time
I want to say one more thing
Jesus doesn't need it
You don't have to put the S after it, that's okay
Whoops, can you get us back? There we go
In the Christian hierarchy resulted in his hatred, right?
But make sure you know, this gentleman or she, whoever it is
Has an understanding of Jesus' teachings that I do not
I would just appeal to you
Love of all religions
I would just appeal to you
Try to consider that you may be sitting there
Consider it a thought experiment
I'm trying to reach out to you evangelicals
I'm trying, just as I did to bring you to life
You drunkards
Just as I brought those drunkards and the mission to life
I want to bring you to a rebirth
Love of all religions
Yes, I want you to bring you to that place
Are you ready?
You have never read the Bible
You have never read the Bible
If I could have you in my gym
We could read together within a few hours
The entire New Testament
Yeah, that's a workout
Seeing how far you can get in an hour
Is a workout for those of us who do ancient Greek
Yeah, let me honestly
Love of all religions
You have never, please
Just think to yourself
Is there a possibility I have never read the Bible
Yes, when you do
Come back and tell me about the pirate child
Trafficking savior of yours
Who was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m.
With a naked boy
Leave the glory bombs at home
Yes, okay
So the rest of us are here
To take that resistance
You feel that resistance?
Use it as a wave
Use it as a wave, right?
As much as you desire to uncover
They desire to cover up, right?
These are the same people that shout
At the bank of cameras that are recording them
You are lying
Yes, yes, right
Remember, remember
There's just one question
Job, Job brings the whole thing down, right?
It's not that the man's entire family was killed
That's not what bothers us
What bothers us is whether he would curse the God who would do it
Yeah, yeah
I'll tell you this much
If somebody killed my whole family after lying to them
I sure as heck would not be amenable to their suggestions
But for the love of all religions
There we are
We're not here, though
Love, I'll just call you love from now on
Love, we're not here
Yes, you're in custody, love
Right, we've got you shackled, no
Love, we need to dip deep tonight
Juno wants to go deep and she wants to see
Everybody, get on that, everybody in the ship now
Let's go, let's go, let's get in it
We're gonna have an in-flight film
But I want us to get on that ship
And we're headed back to that Mithraic initiation
We're there with our daughter
Remember that, you guys remember
We're there with our daughter
We saw that guy with his daughter
And he was taking her in for the initiation
She's already been prepped with instructions
And we managed, somebody managed to sneak out
And get his, you're welcome
To sneak out and get his diary, right
We got his personal notes
Isn't that nice, somebody throw him away
In a garbage dump
Why, because they contain the stuff
They contain the stuff that Paul said
Do not greed
You gotta ask yourself, is Neva Angelico
Maybe you're an apologist
Those guys are ridiculous
You know what's better than seeing somebody
Born again, somebody die again
That's, when you see that soul collapse
And that new birth decay
Then you know what nature is for
You know what I mean, then you know
Then you know, yes
How great that art
Let's keep going, let's keep going
So we're inside the ship
And we're flying there
I'm just taking up your time
So that we can get there
We're at that ceremony
And here we see
Here she comes
Here comes the dance
Here comes the song
And we are transported there
By the Alpha and the Omega
We tune ourselves up completely
And we are there, Alpha and Omega
Portals open
Did anybody bring the drugs?
Did, oh man
Fish, somebody go get fish
Fish, did you bring the drugs?
Somebody, who was supposed to prep these things?
Who was supposed to prep?
Somebody was, my goodness
Don't worry, it's a good thing
He wrote it all down
Whoever stole that journal
Congratulations, that was the smartest one of us
Right, here we go
So, yeah, let's just read
I want to take you to a section
That we haven't done yet
I want to take you to a section
Here we go
Take a sunscarf, which has 12 rays
And make it fall into a deep turquoise cup
At the time when the moon is visible
Put it together with the seed
With the fruit pulp with the lotus and honey
And after grinding it, prepare a cake
And at once, you will see it, the scarab
Moving forward and eating it
And when it has consumed it, it immediately dies
Pick it up, throw it into a glass vessel
Of excellent rose oil, much as you wish
And spreading sacred sand in the pure manner
Set the vessel on it and say the formula
Over the vessel for seven days
While the sun is mid-heaven
We're going to be singing with our drugs
There's so many drugs here tonight, right?
Not only that, but does anybody smell that?
Does anybody smell the air?
We're in the mystery riot, right?
You can see the Christians doing this
We're in the mystery riot
What is that smell?
It's koo-fi
Koo-fi?
What's koo-fi?
Oh, everybody knows what koo-fi is
There's formula for koo-fi all over
From the first century BC until third
It's a fad
Koo-fi is a fad
Man, these formulae are fads
I want to show you some texts
I'm bringing you some of this
But we've got the koo-fi burning in the air
Because we have a Holy Spirit
We have a Holy Spirit
This is all about fire
And the breath of fire
There's one of us that can do this
Better than anyone else
Her name is Medea
This is the breath of fire
I come from all the way across the Mediterranean
It took me three months to get here
Three months
A couple of times, things were pretty perilous
Ran out of food at one point
It was terrible
Three months we came
Why did we come to see her?
Because she is the one who can breathe the fire
She's the one
Fantastic
Take those three deep breaths in
As you behold those solar rays
Remember, this is the first thing in the morning
Dawn bringers
You mean the early Christians were Luciferians?
You mean the early Christians? Yes
The first Christians were bringers of dawn
Who followed a man who was arrested in a public park
With a naked kid who called himself
Did you ever catch Jesus' gangster name?
Did you ever catch it?
Yeah, give me a morning star
Morning star
That's his name
That's his pop within the cult
That's his pop within the cult
So where are we? Where is our daughter?
Where is our daughter?
She's right now under the protection
Of these substances
That we are fumigating her with
She is under the protection of the gods
This is gorgeous, love it, love it
I'm gonna read you a little bit more
After we're able to start everything off
What happens?
That the sacred spirit may breathe in me
So that I may wonder at the sacred fire
That I may gaze upon the unfathomable
Awesome water of the dawn
The unfathomable awesome water of the dawn
Yeah, that's why you're bringing your daughter here
Yeah, gorgeous, fantastic
I today am about to behold
With immortal eyes
Do you know what the magic is doing?
The magic is doing what the tree in Edom did
The magic is doing what the tree in Edom did
It's bringing you back
Bringing you back
Memory
Nemosony
Bringing you back
Yeah
Since it is impossible for me
Born immortal
Born immortal of a mortal womb
A womb, a matrix
What is that, who stood on?
That's a matrix
It's a matrix for the life
Okay, so when the text talks about the daughter being born again
Being brought to life, to a stage of life
That's after having entered death
Good, good, I want you to see
As we dive in, as we keep going
As we keep going deeper
What kind of force are we looking for?
There's a brightness and immortal brilliance
From this Alpha to Omega
Drawing breath from the stars
Drawing up three times from the rays
Three times
For in that day and hour
You will see the divine order of the skies
What is that divine order of the skies?
Now, those of you with the edition that I'm reading from
Which is the Hans Dieter Betts' edition
Part of which John Scarborough translated
Those of you who have that
You're one step away
You're one step away, but remember, you're still a step away
You're not receiving that pure stream
You're receiving it filtered
So what is this thing?
Is that what it says? That's not what it actually says
Is it? I've got it up here
I'm going to search my Greek for it today
I'm not quite sure what order
Perhaps it's this one
Oh, it is, good job
Look at this, do you see the last word?
Thessen
That's from Thesses, you could say an organization
A divine organization
Horas
Horas
And there's your problem
That's not the cosmos
That's not the cosmos
No, no, no, it's not
It's not
Sorry, I'm going to get you these backwards
Look, don't look at it
So backwards
Oh, I'm so sorry
Where's my...
It's in here somewhere
I guess I didn't put that one in there
The Horas is any time
that is a cycle
Think of the loop
The Greeks were able to envision
a single abstract concept
of the completion of a cycle
The completion of a cycle
That is the Horas
You have 12 of these during the day
Did you know you completed 12 cycles during the day?
No, it's probably because you didn't also know
that you complete 12 cycles in a year
Right?
Those Horai
are the guardians
Those completed cycles
are the sister guardians
of the gates of Uranos
Okay, stop and think
You're sitting on your throne
I didn't say it this time, but everybody should be
sitting on their throne
Can you see those Horai?
Can you see them?
The completion of a circuit
This is
what I call
gynecological time
It's the member of the species
that can bring life from death
that orders time
Not the masculine
Isn't that interesting?
Interesting
We're well-buried
within a mystery rite
that has a feminine foundation
Evangelicals
Here's a warning, you're not going to like this
Your cult
is a late, late, late development
from a woman's science
meant to bring salvation
Soteria
to the world
Yeah
Thank female physicians
You've been worshiping a man
when your entire art
is based upon the work
of female physicians
The mystery
is not a mystery
like Sherlock Holmes
needs to solve
It's an operation
and now we have the specifics
and the drugs
So, we've got to go ahead
This is the second half
We're right at the pole
This is the second half
So, we're entering this phase
of the initiation
We go forward with the indictment
We go forward with the indictment
Good, I want to read you
a couple more images here
just to get you further
You can see her
You can see her being initiated
She's already developed the drug
The koofy's already burning
The angels have already been added
Yes
Symbol of the living
Yes, make himself low
Then you will see
the gods looking gracious upon you
and no longer rushing
at you
rather going about in their order of affairs
So, when you see the world
above is clear and circling
and that none of the gods
or angels is threatening you
expect to hear a great crash
of thunder
So, as to shock you
then say again, silence
silence
and that's where we ended
We've got her to that point
I want you to bring her now
to that final place
of vision
I want you to go to that place
that knocks out all the prophets
that causes them to
not her
not her
Gorgeous
Gorgeous
When you have said this, the rays
will turn toward you
Look at the center of them
for when you have done this
you will see a youthful god
beautiful in appearance
with fiery hair
and in a white tunic
and a scarlet cloak
and wearing a fiery crown
at once
greet him with the fire
that's that nice
you can see him
ride everybody
this is Jesus
this is Jesus
coming in
open up your
apocalypse and take a look
at how Jesus is represented
oh my goodness
here he is
the morning star
how nice
how do we get here
we get here for the water of dawn
if you had asked me
said Jesus to the woman well
and nobody understands it
especially not any Baptist
if you had asked me
I would give you
living water
yeah
yeah
he was right there
speaking of Baptist
evangelicals
we have to keep up
we've got a clip tonight
I think the clip speaks for itself
it's just another
co-conspirator in the long line
of co-conspirators
who have sprung
from Jesus Christ
hit it Chewie
I
did it escalate
yeah
it escalated up a time
and it started getting more hands on
more
grabbing you by the shirt
grabbing you by the neck
getting real real aggressive
I was in there getting beat on
with a paddle
no clothes
I want people to speak up like I'm doing
I'm right here talking to you right now
my face is on display right now
about what happened to me
tell your story
it really do count
what does the future look like for you
what the future look like for me
uh
you know how many stars
is in the universe
so my future is just
too many absence
my future is in my hands
it's actually in my hands
look we can
come here
so that I can
perform some sort of
masturbatory
scholarship
and
you guys can sit and say
oh isn't this
isn't this wonderful and I can feel better
and you can feel better
or we can say we're not here for that
yeah we're not here for that
we're here to get to the bottom
we're here to open up the reality
we're here to find out what Jesus is doing
with that naked kid
we want to see the rights
we want to know what was going on
I'm offering you
that view of the
rights behind the curtain
this is with the temple
doors open
when the abomination of desolation
yeah
the abomination of the
erimosis
erimosis
when the dot
and antidote sit in the temple
you'll know
run to the hills
run to the hills bockens
it's time for the possession
it's time for the Christ to come back
yeah
what did I do
what did I do
the American Association
of University Professors
along with an international
branch sent members
to
my school
to St. Mary's University
to investigate
my firing
they determined
that I was terminated inappropriately
that it was a matter of
free speech
and not a matter of violating policy
did I make people uncomfortable
there is an edge
there is an edge
to the reality
there is an edge
to the drugs
that allows you
to cut
against the resistance
the reality
burns
through
the chasm
it burns through that emptiness
yeah
all for the sake of visualization
right
I want to read you one more thing
from your text
there also came forth
another seven gods
who have the faces
of black bulls
and loincloth
yes
and what is it that we know
quenches the wrath of the bull
it's the virgin
quenches that wrath
yes
it's through her
it's through that seed
ultimately
the seed of god
the child of god
it's through that
incarnation
that the mystery
is perpetuated
forward
and we drink of that mystery
here we are
I want to give you a couple
just some more drugs
I don't know
we are out of point in this
that we just don't have enough drugs
I want to let you know
I want to let you know
where is the
where is yung
yung always makes me want drugs
we have come to a point
that we know
that they are involved
and the people that they told you
what these mystery religions were
we know that they didn't know
what they were talking about
so let's look at some of the drugs
that are used in the mystery religion
we are going to hit this period now
ships are going to rattle a little bit
we are going to get that bachic roll
and now we are going to go
we are going to go and we are going to see
let me just pull up some drug text
and nobody is going to do this for you
you know what you like
you know what you like
here we go
hey you know when you come to the satanic initiation
at least my
at least my people know
they are not going to get abused
you are not going to get abused
that's cool
hey
we are one step ahead
of the most holy of the
modern humans
we are one step ahead of them
fantastic
let's go to it
a couple of texts here
here we go
look at this
this is so nice
this one is from Galen
don't be surprised
about the condition of the pages
these pages are
from
1840
come on
give them a break
none of my stuff is going to be around
look at this
it's not a simple mixture
it's not a simple mixture
Galen says
it's not simply something that is taken out of the ground
nor is it
something just juiced
he is saying this isn't one of the
symbols this kufi
this thing is a compound mixture
compound mixture
that's right he says the Egyptians
they call this thing
they call this thing the
desentanteon
you know what that is
thesis is
your ability
to redeem someone
let's say
in the sake of a battle
an example of a battle
your ability to keep off the enemy
to protect that person
can be
your revenge
can be your revenge
you know what they call this
this is revenge of the gods
hey how would you like that
how would you like that
if you were invited to a group
you got to spend a couple weeks
getting either 7 or 14 days
depending on the group
you got to spend that much time
doing things like not eating
anything fasting
and you know prepping
you're making drugs
you're doing repairs
you're going over
the liturgy
that you're going to have to perform
you're doing all this come on man you're nervous
this is a hard process
you're going through this
and here we have
what are we going to do
we're going to spend a week there
we're going to go through this process
it's great they got them in Europe now
and all you do is you
enter into this place
and what are they going to call
the train that gets you to this place
they're going to call it the revenge
of the gods
you're going to be inhaling
this right
now this text brings back to the text
there it's you if you get a chance
oh it's a gorgeous rainbow
like that
brings back to this text
he also says here though
there we go
yeah so the preparation
of it you know
it's one that you can burn
right you can burn it up
you commit it to the sacrifice
right to the burnt sacrifice
right
yeah but
let's go back
one
one more forward
advance to this one
this doesn't catch the other side
oh I'm sorry I didn't get it all
darn it
okay well for this one
okay we'll leave that one up there
um
uh
the koofy that's prepared
can be swallowed
he goes on to say it can be swallowed
if you've got asthmatic problems
right if you've got breathing problems
you know if it irritates your lungs
then
you can
you can also swallow it
they have a nice cup
he says
we're able to drink it
this is diascortes now
switch back this is back in time
you know um a little bit
Galen has collected
a whole bunch of stuff and he really values
diascortes
is the drug dude
right he's the one who
puts together the world's best
encyclopedia of drugs this guy is on the mark
right so he has a koofy
recipe as well
he has the type that is
um he says is compounded
for the sake of the
you know the fumigation
yeah right and he says
it's most
most beloved or most
valued by the gods
wait
wait what a minute this pharmacist
yeah this is a pharmacist
slash physician
slash drug expert yeah
and you wouldn't put him in that category
don't try to make him a shaman
diascortes is not a shaman
diascortes is the death of the shaman
I've got the shaman right here
he's right over here come here
he's so deep I got him so deep
in the dungeon I got everybody's
dirty smelly hippie shaman
I'm ready I got you
shaman right here
diascortes ain't no shaman
right
diascortes is a dude who's done the drug
research and he knows
and what does he tell us
about kufi let's go to
let's go back to the kufi
oh excellent
so you know he says it's a compound
yeah and it's used
you know by the egyptian
priests right they use
it to instigate baby
they they they're
experts in this stuff right
and it's used as
a mixture with antidotes
so again I told you guys
about the dot antidote
this kufi
is standing in the place
of our theriac that we talked
about before that we've got
andromicus from
using right we've got
him with the formula
for that right and he's
gotten them from
I forget who
what general it was a Pompey
or something who got him from the east
I can't remember but they come back
down to Nero
through andromicus and here we have
yeah um yeah
so for the asthmatics he says
it's given him a drink
yeah yeah yeah and he says
there's lots of different preparations
of it but most people use
at least these this base
ingredient list
and then he goes on
and then he goes on and on
and with
this list of ingredients now the
mythrodetic forms
of this are way are way
longer and it's
even plenty remarks on it
and he says as it's been noted everybody knows this
um it's ridiculous
these this list of ingredients
is is too long
right how can you possibly
make such a complex combo
back then the contemporaries
were saying my god
these drugs are advanced
so the thing of us is we try to catch up
right we try to say
wait a minute what are all these
what are all these drugs doing in combo
okay let's go up one more
I want to show you a couple more texts
um
uh no
let's see no I can't
it's too I made it too small
in a way I wanted to focus in
yeah
um
no that's fine
wasn't what I wanted
let's go I want to go to a couple words
here just to show you up
um this was from
just last time I want to make sure
you caught this that the oyster
is the um to go
crazy right so this is that
phase that we're entering into
and I want to give you a couple
I had a couple look at the anatole
what is that rising that we're
getting out of this ceremony
this is what we're getting we're
getting a rise we're getting
that point at which the sun
rises there's a reason
where we're here look at it also
means epitole right
fantastic so keep an eye on that
what is the epitole the rising
of a star
yeah can also be the rising
of a wind so for
those of you who have ears to
hear and you know that
our cult
is harnessing the winds
you'll understand why she
has to have seven stars
in her hand and he
tells us in this text he tells
us this is all about the contritus
right and
what is that well here
you can see it equals the deep sass
right so there's something
again about that deep sass
that is involved in our
right with our daughter
it is a kentra for
it's something that carries
with a sting
right it's something that bears
the sting
look how porphyries contain
the center of the universe
okay
those of you with ears to
hear you're going to enter
into a state of kentra
mania yeah what is
something that's kentra manes
that's something that's maddened
by that kentron
but look there's an association
with
the sexuality
uh oh
love is what makes you mad
love is what makes you mad
and puts you into that state
so that you can be one of these
kentriadai
these priests at Athens who drove
an ox to an altar with the gods
right these guys were the
guys of the goads
they were the ones who goaded
on
where we get with this thing
ultimately ending up being
a membrum we relay
right
that posthe is there
for a reason
okay because we're in that sexual
right
fantastic fantastic
okay bring them back
so
I wanted you to see some of the images
that are around we're in
I want to go one more time
this uh
mithras liturgy during a bible study
which we'll do next week the reason
I wanted to do this is
um if you are
able to put yourself
in the performance of a mystery
you can take anything
that a professor
from an ivy league school
has said and you can
shove it
in a place where he's going to be
uncomfortable sitting on it
and that's because
you don't need the interpretation
you need to see the actual
right
honestly love of all religions
I've got to say
you hit upon a real
central truth here
what is the reason
that we are doing this
what is the reason
that that
book is banned
right if that
book is banned
there's a reason
we're here to find out
what that reason is
and to blow it up
to see what it is so I've got
a question for the evangelicals
the pace
and I'll just preface this by saying the
pace of Jesus is a rest
and coming trans-dimensional
trial
is
uh closing
in on us right we will
end with the indictment
so
our investigation you know
we're not here as judge, jury,
and executioner Jesus will have
his day in trans-dimensional court
what warrior
to do is to
bear witness and testify
as to who he was
according
to our evidence
my question to those
of you who are evangelicals
who are listening
those of you who have not
read the bible but go around
claiming that you have
right
or claiming that I have
some sort of trauma from
some sort of higher
religious hierarchy I don't
I'll tell you my friends
I have there's a good chance
that I
have brought to eternal life
more people
than you or anybody
you know
I have performed
and had the
privilege of being
at the new birth
of
those who were down
and out, those who
needed it, those
who needed the purgation came
those who were
desperate
yes, yes
mission work fantastic
and I can tell you
to watch the death
again from the rebirth
is
just as spectacular
if not more spectacular
so here's the question
what was Jesus
doing with a
naked kid in a public
park I'm asking you
evangelicals love of all
religion I'm asking you
dark witch
dark witch I don't think
but
those of you who do
who are born again
those of you who have
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
because you
have believed
the word of God
because you have
committed your life to Christ
because you
you
celebrate His Holy Day
that your ancestors celebrated
that sunrise
with the rising of
Him
I would ask you
what is
He doing with a
naked kid in a public
park
that's what we need to answer
and I would invite all of you
I've asked and I've asked
a lot I've asked a lot of people
and that's a lethal question you can really get into
somebody's mind
by exposing them to this material
so that's what I would
ask you and I want to start bringing
some of your answers forward
what was Jesus doing with a
naked boy in a public park
what was Jesus doing with a
naked boy in a public park
can we play one more time
that clip please Chewie
music
music
music
music
music
music
music
music
music
did it escalate
yeah
it escalated over time
and it started getting more
hands on
grabbing you by the shirt
grabbing me by the neck
and getting real really aggressive
I was in there getting beat on
with a paddle, no clothes
it's like real life getting beat
I want people to speak up like I'm doing
I'm right here talking to you right now
my face is on display right now
about what happened to me
tell your story, your story matters
it really do count
what does the future look like for you
but the future look like for me
uh
you know how many stars
is in the universe
so my future is just
too many options
my future is in my hands
it's actually in my hands
laughter
laughter
in all seriousness
laughing of the
Dalai Lama
with the indwelling Buddha aside
after the kiss
or the tongue suck me
thing whatever that suck my tongue
thing was
in all seriousness
it's that kid that you and I are
really working for
the trans
dimensional
district attorney's office
is the one that's going to bring charges
right
on behalf of that
child
that was with Jesus in the public part
Jesus has gotten all the press
right
that kid is completely
on the outside if it were up to the Christians
they would have buried him a long time ago
right and just gotten rid of him
but we
because we fight
for justice
right we are pagans
we still believe
in the goddess justice
and we need
to fight for that kid
we need to fight for this guy
right and the long
line of children that Jesus Christ
and his followers
have victimized
it's a fight
it's a fight against everything that
is beautiful and it's
the same fight that the Romans were
waging in the first century when the Christians
burned down the city
thank you for coming tonight
we will be
forging ahead
with another
necromancy
to follow
I'm told that because we're in the second
half
of the push toward the apocalypse
that we have to speed things up
now so I'm going to have to start
bringing in witnesses
and it might get ugly
things might get a little bit
strange I need you to sit
with me on that throne
and I need us not to forget
those Chaldean principles
right the Chaldean principle of who
you are you don't know who you are
says Dionysus that's the problem
you don't know who you are
yeah we need to
realize who we are
we need to look into the mirror
we need to be well capable
of that performance
in order to get there we're going to bring
back the dead and
it might be scary
it might be scary
it should be shouldn't any time
that you bring that you perform necromancy
shouldn't it be a little bit
a little bit across the plane please
have your asterian
stay on the throne so that we can
stay submerged in those deep
things I appreciate
your time
in honoring the deep things of
Satan and I say
have a good night Hail Satan
drinking whiskey
