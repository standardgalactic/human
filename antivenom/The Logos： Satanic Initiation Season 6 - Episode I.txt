Sunday morning, dark clouds rising Oh, there's no sunshine anywhere
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom To grasp the message in the air
Oh, if I could have one wish And know that it would come true
Had a wish that God would give us strength To know just what to do
Then we could tear down the fences That fences the only
Fences created by such evil men Then we could tear down the fences
That fences the only Maybe we could walk together again
Welcome to Lady Babylon. This is the Season 6 opener.
I tell you what, last time, last season we had a mandate
and that was to kick down the doors and take back the text.
I am very pleased to report that we have proceeded in our mission forward.
This season, this season, it's our mandate to bring forward the untranslated reality.
I am going to be bringing you texts, sealed texts that have not been opened.
And we're going to open the seals. This is Season 6, Lady Babylon.
Today we have quite a somber but striking chord to begin with to open up this season.
And I am just very grateful that everybody can be here to participate in this.
I'm going to be very careful of your time, very respectful.
And I'd like to begin tonight just to set us in the mood, just to set us in the place.
Before I even tell you what we're going to do, where we're going to go.
I want you to see just a few quotes, just a few quotes of the Medea.
Now these are auto-translated, yes.
And I hope that you will understand the spirit behind them.
Let's get into this place. We've got the images for you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Fantastic. We put ourselves through Seneca in the court of Nero.
And of course Nero is digging into the dirt.
He's sending out his embassies to pick up all of these theriacs,
all these compound formulas that can be used in the mysteries.
For those of you who haven't caught up to that point yet,
we're talking drugs, compound drugs, turning the human body into a drug manufacturing device.
We're talking about cults that are entering into satiriasis through the power of something called the burning purple.
We've all seen it. We all know it.
We've stood at the feet of that cross.
And we have seen that serpent wrap around the cross.
And we knew this is our salvation.
Right?
Thank you. Thank you for all the drugs.
Yeah. Tonight what we're going to do, right?
I've had the machine go on while I was doing that little song and dance for you.
But tonight where we're going is to a text.
And this text is not often looked at.
People are not that interested in it, but it is the perfect and precise bridge.
It is the perfect and precise bridge for us to step back into that New Testament.
Yeah. Yeah.
We have to go native in order to get to it.
Now this explains exactly all the cult that Jesus is involved in.
And our job this season is to bring to light the cult of Jesus in untranslated work using the Vox, Orphic.
The Orphic voice. Orphica. Nice.
Let's hit that first.
We've got a comment to hit.
Yep. Go ahead. Hit the comments now.
Hey, you've dropped more insight than Crowley did in 50 years.
Sorry, people. You know me. I switch gears quick.
But I want you to have a couple of comments.
Come on, man. It's fun.
And thank you guys for participating.
I'm Crowley did in 50 years.
I've read original sin.
Only a square would fail to comprehend prudentious struggles with Saudi mode libido.
Oh, I smell nastiness.
Yes. Yes.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Very, very much cheese.
Commando. Fantastic.
Fantastic. Beautiful.
Hit us with another one.
Thank you, Chewie.
Oh, you put that one in there on purpose, didn't you?
You say no, you did.
That's okay.
You can have your time in the limelight.
Thank you, Chewie, for what you do.
So lovely.
I was moved by what I'm and said about you.
I also was not in the light in the least surprised.
Another terrific episode.
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Chewie.
You know, we wouldn't be here.
Right.
If it weren't for Chewie.
So little round of applause for Chewie.
Say something nice in the notes.
Let's do we have one more?
Was that it?
Oh, it's got to be said, Dr.
You are absolutely sizzling hot.
Thank you, Elaine.
It makes me take down for a second.
Yeah.
It makes me feel very good to know that I am sizzling hot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It does.
It does.
Fantastic.
Do we have any other ones?
No, that's it.
Okay.
You got the start charts.
Hit us with the first hit us with our first bit of Greek.
Who am I tonight?
I want you to say my name.
Right.
Who am I?
I'm the Christos Wanox.
Uh-oh.
And then everybody in Greek says, but there's an oak there.
Yeah.
I am not the Christos Wanox.
And I just wanted to wake you up with this.
What is it?
What is a Christ Wanox?
Have you heard of the Christ Wanox?
Yes.
Very, very old, old, old, old, old Mycenaean.
Love it.
This is the kind of stuff that you're delving into the vocabulary of a Bronze Age cult.
And you say, why are they calling Jesus the Christ, the Bronze Age Wanox?
That's why the watchers are always giving me a hard time about you guys and Melchisedic.
Right.
It's what they said.
Don't pull that.
You know it's Melchisedic.
Right.
Melchisedic.
Right.
He's also.
Ahmator.
You don't know these things because you're restricted.
Right.
Do you see?
Do you see everyone?
The Bible studies people, they're restricted.
They restrict themselves.
What I am reading you tonight are the words of the Bacchic prophet, St. John.
Yeah.
Now, which of the St. John's?
There's several St. John's, right there.
This is the one that does all the baptizing.
He's the one within the purple.
The what?
He's a Baptist.
Don't worry.
What are those Baptists carry around?
There's a glass dildo.
Yes.
It's a drinking cup.
Right.
Fantastic.
We're here.
Okay.
Did you see it?
Smell it.
We just got out of the ship and it was like, whoo, this place is first century sewage.
Great.
You know you're in the right place.
Now, what am I giving you to read that prophet, that Bacchic prophet, who I'm going to show
you for the first time.
You're not going to see this anywhere else.
I'm going to show you for the first time what John the Baptist really was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you're going to see what kind of person.
You're going to smell him.
You're going to taste him.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
This is good.
What am I reading to you tonight?
What source was that that I'm flashing up in front of you?
What is the voice of John who says, I am not the one ox Christos.
I am not the one ox Christos hit me with the one ox.
It's the next Greek from Alice.
Blow that up.
Sure.
Thanks.
Fantastic.
Look at this guys for all of the Greek students.
Look at just the first thing you get under a, do you see that the F looking letter on
there?
That's the Greek diagram.
Yeah.
Now you know why I'm saying one ox.
You're like, well, is the W and you don't know where it is.
Right?
Um, there it is.
There it is.
Well, is it?
There it is.
Look at the one a case.
You know what the one a case are?
One a case.
Oh, God.
Those are the savior gods.
And if you have any brains when you're at sea, you will have honored this one a case.
Oh, God.
Love this stuff.
Isn't it culty?
Fantastic.
It just, it brings up so much.
Let's go to another, another poet, please pull in the Greek.
Look what we're looking at people.
This is what I'm showing you tonight.
This is known as the penopolis, his metabolite of John.
What is a metabolite?
Oh, you'll see it defined various and send me ways.
Yeah.
Um, why don't we just say, um, it is a, an exchange of transformation, a restatement
to retelling a decomposition and recomposition metabolite.
Nobody cares about titles and none of these titles are original.
So forget about it.
What is this thing?
It's the gospel of John written by someone who is deep knee deep in the flood of classical
cult.
This guy knows more about Bacchus than anybody for the last 500 years.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
People debate.
It's so disturbing that people debate.
Was he a Christian?
Was he a pagan?
Was he, and the scholars came up with this idea.
They said, Hey, he's a crypto pagan, right?
Cause they got, we got nothing better to do than to sit in the rooms and say, let's make
up some words, bro.
Right?
Crypto pagan.
What does that mean?
It means he would have never gotten his stuff published if he had not said he was a Christian.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
And we have in the most beautiful cult terminology, the gospel of John, you'll find the miracles
suddenly.
Oh, it makes sense.
Oh my God.
How long were we waiting to break that seal?
Love it.
Give me another Greek text.
Let's just, oh, let's just bathe in it tonight.
This is lovely.
We're going to see.
Take, take down.
I want everybody to remember.
You read this first line.
What is he doing to this?
Who are these?
Who are those servants?
What's he doing?
He's ordering around the servants to get busy and what to get busy in the dipsados and lapines
in the communion of the viper.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't forget this.
Jesus is the one who makes the crack.
Jesus is the one who knows the formula.
Jesus has the burning purple and here he's supposed to be given it to the folks.
Yeah.
It's a miracle.
What does he do?
He makes his wife, man.
Oh my God.
That was fantastic.
They call it the banquet.
Now look, you cannot deny this.
The banquet of the viper.
The banquet of the viper, the communion of the viper.
Oh my goodness.
Jesus, can we do that whole viper thing?
No wonder he's always walking around.
Yeah, I'll teach you to not have to worry about poison the snakes.
Yeah.
Druggy.
Did you know he was a druggy?
Watch what John does.
John gets nuts.
Why'd you think he was wearing the outfit of a bucket?
Yeah.
We're going to see him bring up the next one.
This is gorgeous.
Love it.
Did we finish that one?
Yeah.
We finished that previous one.
Here, and look, the logos.
The logos became sarks, right?
This is the beginning of John, right?
The word, the pastors will translate this.
And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
And we bear this glory, right?
Now, and they'll say the ones that really had spent two days in Greek and
in seminary, they'll tell you.
And the word for Jesus coming to be among men is the word to set up a tent.
And it is a reflection of the dent and the wilderness, right?
They really get into that.
But what they don't get into is the whole viper communion.
What's the viper communion?
Well, these are the verses in John.
Now, let's look at how they are translated by known us.
Let's see by this creepy crypto pagan sorcerer.
Next one.
Here it is.
Here is his version of it.
Kylogos auto delestos.
Wait, what is the logos?
What is the logos?
What is the logos?
The logos is self initiated.
Self initiated.
You mean Jesus Christ is the self initiated?
Yep.
Yep.
Right from the beginning.
Culp terminology all over it.
Look at it.
What does he do?
What does the logos do?
In sarcose.
In sarcose.
You know what sarx is?
I love to tell you this because it's dirty.
Sarx.
They translate it.
They translate it as flesh.
But sarx is what contains your innermost dirty desire.
Your dirty filthy dirty thoughts.
Those are the sarx.
Those are the sarx.
Can you feel the flesh?
Can you feel the flesh?
When you're out testifying.
Can you feel the flesh around you?
Can you honor Aphrodite?
Can you appreciate Bacchus?
Do you like democracy?
Yeah.
A little bit of justice.
A little bit of decay.
Love it.
Let's bring up some more.
Call it up.
It's coming through.
Let's go.
Here's the beginning of John.
Are you guys ready?
Because pastors and preachers love this stuff.
Take notes.
Pastors and preachers take notes.
You're never going to see this again.
In the beginning was the Logos.
And the Logos was with God.
And the Logos was the God.
And this one was in the beginning.
Prostantheon.
With God and the presence of God.
Okay.
Fantastic.
We've all heard that.
We've all heard that.
And what is that Logos?
Can anybody tell me what that Logos is?
What is that, Alice?
How's that way you phrased it?
The inward debate of the soul.
The inward debate of the soul.
The accounting.
The reckoning.
The reason.
The Logos.
So John says in the beginning was the Logos.
And Nona says,
I'll translate that for you.
Next one.
Yep.
Here's his translation.
Here's his translation.
There is a Logos.
And that Logos is a chronic and unaccessible.
And it dwells within the inexpressible arch.
It dwells within the beginning.
It dwells within the right.
It dwells within the rulership.
And those archons are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this place is Areton.
It cannot be expressed.
It is ineffable.
And what is this Logos?
This Logos is just like its same natured parent.
The son Amator, the son without a mother.
The Logos of the self-generated God.
Light from light.
Mortality.
Exactly indistinguishable from the father.
Fooling upon the same throne that is endless.
This is the Presbyteros Cosmoio.
This is that very oldest, most authoritative entity
who is involved with the cosmos, the organization.
We're talking universe.
We're talking everything.
Yeah.
All dimensions.
And if you just look at the bottom of this Greek,
I just want you to see the first word in the first line.
Zoe.
What is inborn within the Logos, he says at the bottom?
Zoe is.
Zoe who is posimelousa.
This Zoe who is, who is given, who gives advantage to all.
This universal life.
Zoe is life in the Septuagint, the text that we just claimed back.
We just kicked down the door and took back.
It says the Elwa's name is Zoe.
The Elwa's name is Zoe.
Zoe is inborn within the Logos.
Now you say, oh, that doesn't sound very Christian to me.
Well, it's not the version that you have received for the last 1600 years of filtration.
Yes, it's not.
But then again, you don't have sex under the influence of drugs when you go to church.
And I'm quite certain that you do not, as a Christian would in the first and second centuries,
you do not perform fallatio on your priest.
They were getting arrested for that.
Yeah, that's quite a racket, no?
Yeah, it is.
There's a lot of stuff you don't know about your own religion and your own background,
and that's what we're here to do.
We're here to show you that.
Let's go to the next.
This is getting, I need to, I need to do something to someone over here.
Who are we?
I don't want to just call up random.
Let's get the next text in there.
I want people to see this and then we'll have the, and we can go on.
Please give me another.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I want you to notice that this ometor, this just the without the mother, without the mother.
You mean the Christos?
The one that we're calling the she here.
Yeah.
The one that we're saying is the logos, the inborn Zoe, the inborn Zoe.
Jesus is the inborn Zoe.
He is the Awa.
Are your eyes open?
Are your eyes open?
Let's go to the next text.
We need a little text.
Go ahead.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
That's okay.
Original Primal.
That's okay.
We don't need a little bit beyond that.
Yeah.
I want to.
This is the one describing himself says.
This is that point in the gospel where John says, I'm the voice of the one crying in the
wilderness.
Right.
And everybody looks at that and they say, oh, how beautiful, romantic and gorgeous it
is.
In the words of Nonus, let's turn up the cult.
Let's turn up the cult.
I am the voice of the morning come to you from the void in the rock.
Wait, what did, what did that junkie say?
John's a total junkie.
Right.
The baptized are.
Right.
And yeah.
And there's sex drugs they're using.
That's why they're, they all walk around with a penis shaped cup.
Tada.
If you see a picture of John the Baptist like so, I guess it's on this like so here.
I don't want to put that anywhere.
Right.
Right.
If you remember this guy is charged on drugs and he's involved in sex rights, sex rights
and he's got purple.
You wonder why Paul had to go all the way through up to redo all the baptisms that John had
done.
There's certain things that we don't do with the thorns in our flesh.
The thorns in our flesh.
Yes.
If you have ears to hear, you will have just heard me make a specific drug reference.
Yes.
Fantastic.
Okay.
Let's get another, another Greek text.
I want to keep the picture building.
Get.
Oh, look, and what does John say that he is?
He's, um, he says that he's the entheonondra or the text, the text calls him the entheonondra
entheonondra.
What kind of man is an entheonondra?
And some of you get a little bit excited because you hear the word that Carl Rock coin entheogen.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Now, what is an entheotic person?
Do you want to be an entheotic person?
I want to, I kind of want to know what's an entheotic person next slide.
Look at this.
Enthus.
It's literally people having the divinity inside you, right?
Full of the God inspired or possessed.
Yes.
But look at Roman numeral number two of divine frenzy inspired by the gods.
And you can see the word Monty after it and Montaei rides.
You have that working of the God within when you were at those fumigations, right?
When you were at those fumigations.
What did you do?
What did you do at those fumigations?
No.
Listen.
You said that.
I'm talking to the former head of my department while I was district who said the Romans in
Greece just wouldn't do such things, use drugs.
How do you get that?
No, stay there.
We'll bring you that later.
How do you get there without the drugs?
The fumigations are sitting right in front of you.
They fumigated.
They did this to you.
They did this.
He's already dead.
Fumigations.
Love it.
For those of you who haven't been around, we've been talking about lots of sex drugs and fumigations.
That's what they've got going on.
There are people walking around who've had erections for 48 hours that can't get rid of them.
They're in a psychotic state.
Yes.
You put these people together?
Yes.
You put them into groups and let them dance it out.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
We need to go to a little bit more Greek.
A little bit more Greek.
Pour it on just a little bit.
Look at this one, guys.
I love this one.
Yeah.
What is John doing?
John is raising the Bacchic shout.
He's raising the voice that brings the God.
He is that divine power.
He is that Bacchus.
So that John is given the epithet that we know was given to Heracles.
Why is John like Heracles?
Well, if you're talking about mystery cult and you're talking about the dragon's banquet.
Then you're talking about Highless and Heracles.
And Highless is Heracles' young boy friend.
Yes.
Young boy friend.
And now you understand the baptisms.
Yes.
God.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
There's always a nymph hidden somewhere, right?
There's always a nymph.
Love it.
Love it.
Did you know John the Baptist was that dirty?
Some of you, I know, are going to write to me in various capacities and you're going to say something about me going to hell or something like that.
And you're going to say it's for bringing such slander to the name of the great and powerful John.
Yes.
The Bacchic.
The Bacchic frenzied drug using child rapist John.
Let me say that one more time.
The drug frenzied child rapist John the Baptist.
It's okay.
Salome.
Salome brought it to an end.
Salome brought it to an end.
You say, well, I thought she was the bad, right?
That's what happens.
She wasn't the bad guy.
All right.
He was.
Things get switched around when the government gets taken over by the minority that is a fundamentalist, wacko bunch of apocalypse bringing, burning down Rome, destroying books and burning bitches.
Did I say I meant witches?
That was excuse me.
Yeah, let's not get.
Can we, we can't beep that out because it was a slip.
Burning witches, burning witches, the same people.
Bring up the Greek.
I apologize.
That was a complete because, you know, the, the bitches were the people doing the burning.
I know that because I read a text about a woman who was being burned and she was screaming at the people, the Christians watching her as she was being burned.
And she was screaming at them, telling them, I am your punishment.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
Love it.
If you ever get a chance to wave a Fasciam or a phallus in the face of a child molesting priest, you may feel that you've received justice.
I know I did.
I know the entire school did.
It's out there.
Love it.
Bring it up.
Bring it up.
Here we've got another text.
Look at this.
And the light has shined in the darkness.
This is that right?
Your preacher is standing there.
This is John.
The light has shined in the darkness and the darkness does not comprehend the light.
This is the light of Jesus.
Right.
There was a dude, it says in verse six.
There was this dude.
He was sent from God and his name was John.
He came to be a witness.
Give us now what known as tells us what little tidbits.
Can we can we get from this?
Look right at the top.
We've got Zoe again.
We've got that living life that's with embedded within the logos.
Right.
And we've got into this dark fog of death cosmos came this shining guy.
This shining earth shaking glorious light.
Yeah.
The darkness couldn't comprehend it.
The darkness couldn't grasp it.
And there was this dude in this beef feeding little place.
Cops.
They used to call this C O P S C.
Right.
It's a, oh, whatever a grove.
Some kind of grove.
There's trays and bees.
Right.
Beef head.
Isn't that a nice word?
Millie support.
Beef head.
I love that.
Anyway, there's the student there.
This Bakken dude.
Right.
And what is he doing?
He's not even a citizen of where you and I are from.
Right.
He's a citizen of the Ramon.
He is speaking from the Ramon that is hidden within the crack of the rock.
Do you hear me?
This is John speaking to you from the void.
This is John speaking to you.
A herald.
A herald of the first baptism.
A herald of the origin.
His name is John.
The divine breaker of people.
Wait, what?
Wait.
Did you, did you say the breaker of people?
Wait.
What is it?
Is this?
Oh my goodness.
I had it there up until I saw John breaking people.
But we know that he's the Heracles because he's got the title.
And if he's got the title, he's got the high list because everybody knows in the
prior pig poems, you can drink out of the buttocks of Ganymede.
You can drink.
Now why did they say that?
That's a direct quote.
You can drink out of the buttocks of Ganymede.
Zeus's cup bear.
Where do you think that nectar comes from, Jesus?
There's a reason, the bandage that was on the naked kid that was with Jesus when he
was arrested in the public park of for him.
There's a reason the bandage is over his private parts.
Yeah.
Are we getting closer?
Are we getting the bucket gear on, right?
Can we get the image?
Can someone please out there?
Please, use your AI, plug in with something.
Bring me the image of Jesus and the boy with the bandage private parts.
Please, please.
It's a religious icon preserving Mark 1451 and 52.
I commission you in the name of the most excellent Christ, Wanak's, arrested, crucified for you.
Crucified.
I almost had you there and I felt somebody out there I could feel.
I had a little bit of sweep of the convincing, yes.
It turns out because it's all real.
It's always, isn't that funny?
The reality is always a slap in the face.
Yeah, let's go to one more source and then we're going to excuse people tonight because
I thank you.
I'm cognizant of your time.
Let's get something valuable.
Look at this one.
Yeah, he's the one who's doing, I just wanted to show you, he's the one who's doing the
purifications.
Yeah, and he's adding, what's this great guy going to do?
He's going to be adding this pneumatic, you know, just keep going.
This is just, you know, it's all infused within the nature, baby.
It's all, we got to do all of this just to put the stuff in the sarks, right?
All in that nature of man, ride, ride, and by man, I mean people, humans, right?
It didn't mean to sound funny there, anyway.
Yeah, although it is typically, it is a male there in the text, but we don't ask people
in general.
There's no reason you ladies can't be possessed.
It's ridiculous.
Kind of discriminatory.
Next text.
When you think about it, the woman is giving the communion, right?
So, you know, Eve was there for a good reason.
And when it came down to the drugs, the devil was straight up with her.
She's going to get naked and you're going to open your eyes.
Why do you think the devil?
I forgot.
I'm glad I just recalled this to mine because I promised the devil I would mention it.
Remember, he's really handsome.
All right, come on, give him a break.
He wasn't going to lie to her, right?
He wasn't going to lie to Eve.
He, that Zoe, you can't be disingenuous with life.
You can't.
You can be disingenuous with yourself, but you can't with Zoe.
And the devil knew that.
And he knew Jehovah just lost a couple of ranks.
He just fell.
He's going to lie in order to cover up something that this woman is looking for.
Give it to her.
Give her the truth.
That's what Zoe is worth.
That's what she's worth.
She's worth the truth.
And if you're not willing to be true, you can just end up serving a misogynist.
I can't imagine anybody.
You know, I'm sitting with the watchers and I just, I get what they're saying.
You cannot imagine a sentient being who wants to bow down for an eternity to a misogynist,
a lying misogynist.
Who wants that?
Who wants that?
Yeah.
Let it be known that 30% of all angelic beings said Lucifer is right.
Jehovah has got that lack, that lack of unique words.
Eight thousand.
Eight thousand.
Yahoo.
Zeus.
Zeus comparatively.
Zeus.
It is a fact.
It is a fact that the phallus was erected in the middle of the Holy of Holies.
Do you know those of us who can worship that God?
That's life.
And every one of you was brought into this world through that gateway.
Every one of us.
Swim, swim, swim.
Swim, swim, swim.
Right into mommy's egg.
Yes.
So you can see where the Greeks are.
They're right in this, you know, as human beings, they're right in this world of familiarity.
And all we need of these texts is just to pop that, pop those images out.
You're going to see Jesus and John the Baptist.
You're going to see other people in ways that you didn't realize they were this way.
You're going to see conversations that make sense.
You're going to wonder, have you ever wondered why you were supposed to have been born again?
Yeah.
You weren't born again.
What?
We got to redo the baptism.
Yeah, we got to redo the baptism.
It's a thorn in the flesh, baby.
Now, here's the thing.
How many of you Satanists?
How many of you pagans would be willing to make that step, to walk that way?
How many of you would like to show up at the great festival of the Bonadia?
Men, you're not allowed.
And they'll kill you if you show up, if you try to infiltrate.
It's an old Amazonian thing.
They imported Bonadia from the East.
Remember those Amazonians that kill, those Scythians that kill three men?
And then they can chase down a mate with which to mate and dispose of later.
You talk about abortion today.
Imagine a society where a woman has a choice to abort you as the husband.
Yeah, love it.
Love it.
Hit that.
Do we have that last, bring that last quote up.
Yeah, this is just, oh, this isn't that sent by the gods.
It was, I had a little, bring maybe that last word.
Yeah.
No, that's okay.
We've got everything.
So what I'm, what I would like you to understand from tonight is that you're seeing the text
of the gospel of John through the eyes of the cult in which Jesus is rooted.
This is a book that would be written by someone with ears to hear who is making plain the
Vox Orpheka, making it plain for you.
And we'll see that when we come across the cult post in a little bit.
We'll see it when Jesus is mixing his wine.
And if we do anything for season six, it will be to open up that vista, that unseen vista
of a reality of a person who, who was way steep in orgy, sex, drugs, castration of children,
cutting of oneself and applying drugs to the incisions.
Who is this man?
He's the man with the wine.
What do I have to do with you, Mary?
Come on.
Come on.
What do you want?
This is not your biz.
This is not my father's ministry.
Right?
What do you have to do with it?
You want them to have the water of life?
Is that what you want?
When Jesus was on the cross, screaming about being thirsty, this text tonight, please realize,
this text tonight said they were engaged, that Jesus was initiating it, giving the orders
for them to be engaged in the dipsass communion.
Do you want to know what Jesus' dipsass communion was?
You want to know about the serpent?
Yeah, you know you do.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Thank you for spending your time and giving your time.
Keep up the questions.
We love it and we'll put up as many good ones as we can.
It's an honor.
Hail Satan.
Thank you.
