Who is Galen? Can you explain who Galen was?
Yeah, Galen is a second century physician.
He works for Marcus Aurelius, the emperor.
And he's probably one of the greatest intellects of western civilization.
He wrote thousands and thousands and thousands of pages.
Probably 10% of it has been translated, if that.
If Tiff...
And nobody goes near the pharmaceutical stuff.
Now, in 2013, I saw for the first time a dissertation was written
in which the person translated Galen's theriac.
Ther... What's a theriac?
A theriac is a multi-drug component that's used to balance a poison or death bringer, they call them.
So like an antidote?
Yeah, exactly an antidote, but they called it a galenic reaction.
That's to bring the balance of the one that can kill you with the one that can keep you alive.
Wow, interesting. What's the point of that?
To die and to be born again.
