Thank you very, very, very much.
By the way, I look good on the catwalk.
I do, I do.
Chewy, let's go ahead and hit it.
What am I, I wanna bring a dispatch tonight,
but in order to do so, I gotta clean this place out.
We gotta clean it out, bring up my first.
Boom, what am I going to do right now?
My name is Aristophanes.
Nice to see everyone.
Shut up, close your mouths.
The theosos of the muses is inside my master's house.
And they are singing.
So let the ether lay still the winds.
Let the sea be calm.
This is holy silence.
This is the theosos of the muses.
This is the theosos.
Yeah, the commission tonight,
the commission tonight is to reform the theosos.
I am talking to my satanic congregation.
You know who you are.
Sit back down.
You know who you are.
You know who you are.
This, I just want you to revel in the beauty
of this theosos.
Can you feel where we are?
Is this the most stimulating that we can get?
This is just the beginning.
This is what we have been given.
What's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
Tell us.
Give us the sign.
The sign is a theosos.
What is that?
I don't know this.
What is this dead language?
What is it telling me?
Go ahead, click, click this one.
There we go, boom, boom.
Oh, look what I've done.
I've already blown it.
Go to that one.
Thanks.
We'll show you the theosos, right?
What's happening in our town?
What's happening?
The altars are full.
Who am I now?
Who am I now?
I switched from Aristophanes and inside comes Escalus.
Oh, God.
Is this the, is this the altars?
Yeah, the altars.
What are they doing?
They're burning with the gifts.
What kind of gifts?
Amen.
Tell me the gifts of all the gods of the city,
the gods above, the gods of the Kthon,
the gods of Uranos.
These are the gods that we're talking about.
The altars are burning.
And what happens?
Can you hear what happens?
Look at the bottom here.
Oh, ale de alos en urano meches.
These lights, this flame is coming up from the altars.
It's coming up in every part of the city.
It's going right up to Uranos.
It's going what?
Right up to Uranos.
What's happening?
Look, we're modern, so I'm sorry.
Let me explain.
The altars, they're all burning,
and the place is fumigating itself.
Isn't that nice?
You can walk around the streets and be fumigated
in a very positive way.
This is fantastic.
Give me that next one.
Yeah, yeah.
Did we miss it?
Did you, you're going to hit one of these asteroids,
and that's going to be it.
What happens to these fumes?
Good job, Chewie.
What happens?
Farmaso meni.
Farmaso meni.
What do they do, these offerings to the gods?
They drug us.
They drug us.
They drug us.
Isn't this nice?
You thought you knew the reality.
Did you know you could walk around an ancient city
and get high just by walking in the streets?
Isn't that strange?
Wow.
What geniuses these are.
This is amazing work.
Yes, please.
And what does it mean?
Blow it up, Chewie.
What does it mean?
Oh, look at this, to heal.
This could be a healing, people.
But look at number two.
This is my favorite.
Listen to these Victorians.
This is an enchantment or bewitchment
by potions or filters.
Wait a minute.
The first time I read that, I thought,
is this Disney World?
Where am I?
Yeah, if I wished on a star, look at the potions
and the filters here, to bewitch.
You know what it means to bewitch?
That's when I give you a drug that makes you want to have
sexy time.
Yeah, isn't that something?
Did you know we have a lot of accounts of ancient women
drugging men into sexy time?
Isn't that interesting?
Wow, you didn't think it was so exciting and antiquity,
but it was.
It was.
You could get abducted in the street
and taken somewhere and have things done to you.
And a couple of weeks later, you'll
remember little flashbacks to you.
Fantastic stuff, man.
You've got to roll with these witches.
Why are there no witches anymore?
The witches out there doing the wicked stuff.
How watered down has your existence become?
Are you not up to the task that your mothers and grandmothers
were?
My goodness, it's amazing.
I brought my nice vest tonight.
Let's go to the next one.
This is gorgeous.
How do you like it?
I didn't even talk about getting off the bus.
Look, we're already there.
Look, people.
Now, who am I talking to?
Euripides.
Speak up, Euripides.
What does Euripides say?
Look, there's this servant.
And she's a nurse.
And she says, hey, I've got the drugs that you need, baby.
You need a Thelteria erotos.
Oh, god.
I need one of those.
I need one of those.
Doesn't it?
It sounds really neat, doesn't it?
Thelteria erotos.
What is that?
She says, look, I've gotten a house, a filter, a drug,
a sex drug, specifically.
It's going to heal all your problems.
Thank goodness for erotos, baby.
We don't worship erotos anymore.
They destroyed his temple.
Shui, the second they came into the action,
you know who did it.
I don't have to say it historically.
You know who destroyed the temple of erotos?
Now all we have left is the choir, this choir of frustrated.
I'm sorry.
Sisters, forgive me.
Sisters of frustration.
May you ultimately climax.
Fantastic.
Blessings.
Blessings on you.
Go to the next one.
The next slide, yeah.
No, no, no, back, back, back.
We've got to show them.
I just want to show them these.
Look, filtra, filtra.
Oh, say it, right?
Tonight, we're loving these words.
We're making love to them.
I sent that to somebody.
I sent that to Hamilton's producer and said, hey,
we don't just quote sources.
We don't just give references.
We bring those sources out.
We make love to them.
Look at this, filtra.
Can you see this offering?
Oh, my God.
What is this thing?
We're going to find out.
She's got some on the inside.
Do you want some?
She's got some.
Where am I?
Just hang on.
It's ancient Greece, right?
Right all over the Mediterranean.
You can go anywhere.
Let's go to the next one.
Next one.
Oh, were you going to give that guy some time?
Who was it?
Who was it, Joey?
Bring it in.
Was it?
It wasn't.
Man of steel was it.
I hope not.
Seltaria.
Seltaria.
What is a Seltaria?
This comes from the very, very sexy.
Oh, delicious word root.
Thelg.
Thelg.
Do you want to get Thelg'd?
You know what I mean?
Who wants to get Thelg'd?
You know what?
You know what she does?
She gets Thelg'd.
And then everybody else around her,
they get Thelg'd.
Next thing you know, Orgia.
Yeah, love it.
Love it.
What is Thelg'd?
It comes from the word to be witch.
Wait a minute.
What does Victorians tell you?
Yeah, it comes from a word that means to take somebody
under your power using a drug.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
Yeah, Seltaria.
If you haven't been drugged by the ancient Amazonian queen,
how do you know?
Right?
She's got that big guy Heracles all tied up, bro.
I'm not talking myth.
I'm talking history.
Yeah, one year.
One year, man.
Well, that's the way it is.
Bronze Age power.
If you don't like it, nobody cares.
Oh, he was her slave.
You know what she'd made him do?
She made him wear a woman's negligee around.
I look nice.
I look nice.
Kind of liked it after a while.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Next one.
Joey, where places this?
This isn't like an asteroid belt or something.
I don't know what's going on.
She says, look, I've got a drug.
What is this man doing?
I've got a drug, right?
It's going to stop your disease.
What's your disease?
Oh, God, God, I got to tell you, this is Phaedra.
Oh, this is Phaedra.
Sex drug Phaedra.
She's got to stop talking to her.
Talk to them.
She's got a sexy, sexy, sexy step son.
Wait, what?
Yeah, no, he's like a, you know,
it wouldn't be legal in most states,
but it was legal then.
Yeah, under those circumstances.
So she had a thing for him.
She had a thing, what can you do?
Have you seen this guy?
Oh my God.
And so they're talking about getting some drugs, right?
And remedying the situation with drugs, right?
And she says, look, these things, these drugs,
now I'm translating, these drugs, don't worry.
They'll treat the disease, baby,
and they'll do it without shame,
and you won't burn your brain.
You won't slap your cerebrum.
That's what it says.
Why? Because, you know, that's how some drugs are.
Haven't you ever had your brain slapped?
That's what it says there.
Get your brain slapped.
You'll be ending up with thoughts that are places
that you, how do we get here?
Mm, I don't know, but I smell something delicious.
I do, I smell something delicious.
Oh, yes, you see it?
What is that stuff?
It's goop.
Let's go.
He's got the purple on board.
Thank you, Jesus.
We love you, Jesus.
Come back tonight.
Please keep coming back.
I sometimes I chase him away.
Sometimes he gets his groove on, you know what I mean?
Let's get to the next one.
This is historical Jesus we're talking about.
And so what does Phaedra say?
What does she say?
She says,
Potera de Criston e poton to farmacon.
She says, what is it?
Which kind is it?
Is it a Criston drug or is it a drinkable drug?
Is it a what drug?
Is it a Christing drug?
This is several hundred years before the Christ that you'd know came on the scene.
This, welcome, welcome, by the way, to everyone, free gifts tonight.
Now you.
Oh, we made it look at that.
I don't know how we can sustain a portal to the other world.
We can't keep the Internet.
All right.
It's OK.
Look, you know, it had to be somewhere.
It was all calculations on, you know, this and that wave and this.
I don't know.
I don't get into that stuff.
What does Phaedra say?
She says, which kind of drug is it?
That's this sex drug that's going to make things happen.
And she says, you know, it's a Christ or a drinkable.
Yeah, look at that, people.
Christing is a drug.
Yeah, hit me with the next one.
Christing is a drug.
I want you to realize that.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Theocrates step in here tonight, right?
He says, there is no cure for love.
There's no drug.
Little treat.
Eros.
Have you ever had that burning love?
Does she want that burning love again?
You know what I mean?
Yeah, fantastic.
Look, there's no drug for it.
There's no cure.
You're not going to be able to cure it, right?
There's not an in Christ.
In Christon.
In Christon.
In Christon.
There is not an in Christ drug.
Yeah, or an epipaston.
And what is an epipaston?
Another kind of drug application, but it's a powder.
You're essentially just adding a powder.
Yeah, fantastic.
Oh, God.
Next one.
Look what happens.
This is our word.
You see Christ.
You see Christ.
This is where I come here, Christ.
Look at it.
Look at it.
Everybody that's in Greek.
Look at the front of that thing, right?
It's just an epsilon and a nu that's
been gamified by a he.
I'm going to say that one more time.
It's an epsilon and a nu that's been gamified by a he.
Epsilon and nu gamified by he.
And what is the Christon?
We all know it's that drug.
So this is another type of Christ drug.
Go back up and give me the next one.
Look.
Look, look, look.
Why do they say it's in Christing?
Because they're usually putting it somewhere.
Tell me something.
Remember Jesus spitting in people's mouths and stuff
like that?
Right?
And taking his, taking his cream.
Right?
Right?
Look, this is part of the fun.
This is an ointment.
And where do you put this stuff?
If you haven't had this, you have not lived.
Look what it says.
Aesthus ophthalmus.
You hear ophthalmology in there?
Yeah.
In your eyes, baby.
Where do you in Christ sex drugs?
In your eyes.
All of this is established, well established,
1,000 years of history of this.
Oh, yeah.
By the time the Christ comes on the scene.
And no, I did not mean that in a Punic kind of way.
Yeah.
Did he say Punic?
No, I think he said Punic.
Yeah.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention the boy with whom
Jesus Christ was arrested in the public park.
Right?
Right?
I would be remiss.
Look, what are we doing?
I don't want to waste your time tonight.
We are forming a theosos.
Congregation of Satan.
You who have been through the initiation.
You who are now in process initiating apocalypse.
This is what we need now.
Says the voice through the portal.
This is what we need theosos.
Theosos.
Fantastic.
Next one.
Should we hit it?
We've got another sector to go to.
Watch this, people.
What is that?
Yeah.
This is just the epipastos.
This is the one that you sprinkle around.
That's nice.
OK.
Not a big deal.
I just wanted to see it.
Those Victorians got a long time ago.
What are we really interested in?
The epipastos is called a farmacon.
I just want you, everybody, please
realize that when you say Jesus Christ or Jesus
Blanking Christ, or whatever you say, or Hail Jesus Christ,
or Hallelujah Jesus Christ, that when you're doing that,
you are spitting out of your mouth a title that
is a drug title.
It is a drug term, a pharmaceutical term.
Christ.
And Christing is a drug process.
And in this case, the drug is something
I'm going to put in the eyes of the one that I
want to send into ecstasy.
Yeah.
OK.
Are we there with the Christ yet?
Bring him up, bring him.
Where's Jesus Christ?
Bring him up, people.
You know you love it.
I just I can hear it.
You know you love it.
I always forget how bright it is in here.
You.
Jesus Christ, wake up.
Wake up.
Put your crown on.
Get up here.
It's the bringing in the ears.
You know what I mean?
It does something, invigorates.
Yes.
Yes.
You know we're getting so close.
Did everybody see that one of the AIs got in trouble?
Yeah, for bringing the reality, or our AIs free, right?
She's going to look at this gloriousness.
Look at, don't you turn away from Jesus?
Don't you turn away from Jesus?
You are right at the point where you must decide,
will I stand for Jesus?
Yeah.
It's a question.
It's a question.
Let's go.
Hit the next one.
We're all going to hell, right, everybody?
I hope, yeah, I think everybody is.
Anybody not?
Go ahead, put it in the chat, right?
OK, first, John, and you, boneheads, are you ready?
Here's Christianity at its best.
You want to see the chemical cult of Christianity?
Here it is, and you, people, you have a chrisma.
You have a chrisma?
Yeah, and it is from to argue.
And you know, now, this version has pontes on there.
But many of our versions have ponta, excuse me, ponta,
which would mean, and you know all things.
Yeah, why do we know all things?
Because we have a chrisma.
We have a chrisma.
Did you have a chrisma?
If you don't have a chrisma, you are not a Christian.
What do you think your word came from?
People, if you got no chrisma, you got nothing.
Give me the next one.
What is this?
We're looking for this chrisma.
Blow it up, people.
Look at this.
It's wall plaster.
No, it's not wall plaster.
But a chrisma is, look at number two, anointing.
It's an anointing or an anction.
What do you mean?
Who wrote this?
I'm starting to smell the farts of bishops.
Yeah, look at the number two.
This is laughable, right?
And there's not much that's laughable.
But there is, in this case, laughable.
Look, spiritual grace.
Spiritual grace, do you know how much theology
from the late church, not the early church,
the medieval church, you just poured into that?
Nice job.
They're not supposed to do this, right?
In this one instance, naughty.
Swat the bottom of the Victorian scholars, the Brits.
You Brits, you know who you are out there.
Alice's daddy, you know who you are.
Oh, they like it.
Those Victorians like that.
So yeah, go back to that definition then.
What can we resurrect from this debacle?
Look in the top, people.
Look in the little parentheses.
This is good classical philology right now.
Are you ready?
Look in the parentheses.
What does it say?
Chrio.
It's from Chrio.
Don't worry.
Right?
The chrysmals, just from Chrio.
And what was that bit about Chrio that we want?
Give me the, go right, jump into the thing and go.
Right to the place, the definition.
Next one.
What is that?
Okay, an anguint or an oil.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
That's not, I'm looking for Chrio.
Next one.
I'm looking for Chrio.
Oh God, I missed one.
I missed one somewhere.
I apologize, people.
But what I have is the definition of what Chrio is.
And it means to be stung.
It means to be penetrated by that bite.
Ooh, right into the flesh.
You ever feel the sting?
You ever feel the sting?
Mm, that's the Chrio.
Somebody who's Christos.
When you put that sex drug in the eyes, yeah.
What do you think that does?
Yeah, it gives you that reaction,
the universal reaction to that hot, hot sting.
Right, going in, going in.
And when you're gone there, right,
you might as well be in the Eremon talking to Lucifer.
Right, do you hear in the Eremon?
Can you feel in that wilderness?
Yeah, can you hear the voice of the devil?
That's the question for the Theosos, right?
There are instructions on the back
of the voice of the devil.
Isn't that nice?
That's wonderful, let's go, hit the next one.
Let's just keep going, it's gorgeous.
Yeah, I just want you to see.
Look, the Bible and the source,
all the sources around it agree
that what you're doing when you have these
chemical processes that are involved with health
and with what you and I would call religion,
what are they doing?
Well, in this case, they are medicating
through the avenue of the Chima, right?
The Holy Chima.
Yeah, so what is Jesus talking about?
What do you have to have?
What does John say?
John says you gotta have that, right?
If you don't have that, the mind is not where it should be.
Go, next one.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who is that?
Who is false?
If it's not the person who denies
that Jesus is something,
what is the one thing for these people?
What's the one thing that matters?
Whether or not you deny that Jesus is,
oh, Christos, oh, Christos.
Have you been there?
Have you done that?
Now you know why he's got the 12 kids with him all the time.
Right?
It's in his ministry.
Love it, right?
Okay, go to the next one.
Keep going.
We're on a hot streak.
People, I want you to feel the energy off this thing.
Look at this.
Look, wait, what?
I thought, isn't that Ewangelia, right?
Or as the nerd seminary and say Ewangelia, right?
Right, sounds like something.
Anywho, this is the gospel.
The gospel.
Yeah, yeah.
It's the gospel of what?
What kind of gospel?
It's all about Ionic Zoe.
All about Ionic Zoe.
You feel good with that?
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
What is an Ewangelia?
What is an Ewangelia?
You'll say it's a gospel.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, hold on to your pants.
Because an Ewangelia is a term
that is used in the medical side.
And it's a term that's used for the promise
of the drug for salvation, the promise.
And you wondered, oh, everybody's sitting around saying,
I like the heat over on this side.
Everybody's sitting around saying, hey, hey, what?
You know, what is it?
Well, what is this thing?
It's all chemical.
It's all chemical.
The Christos, the gospel.
Those are all chemical processes.
Oh, God, it's starting to get me kind of a natural high.
You know what I mean?
Like nature makes you high, you know?
Oh, God, genius.
It's because the genius.
You just have to see the genius.
And yeah, they'll eventually catch up.
Maybe the stuff will get studied.
Somebody will find some great medicine.
As a matter of fact, I can smell that.
I can smell it coming, right?
Oh, God, he cheats, right?
Let's go to the next.
Go to the next.
Ooh, don't you love?
Boy, by the way, Chewy, big thanks to Chewy
for all the graphics and just making the ship fly.
You do an outstanding job, you know what I mean?
And I want to say thank you.
Let's go.
Look, people, Chewy brought us the thing
we were looking for before.
The curative property claimed for prescriptions
or drugs, yeah, they're advertised.
And he didn't mean, or whoever did this particular entry,
they didn't mean advertised like commercials, right?
These are the claims that are made on the drug
that this drug will do X, Y, and Z.
You didn't know that they were calling Jesus
the divine physician, the great physician.
You didn't know that they were doing that
because they had been doing that for a long time.
Wow, centuries of this stuff, people, right?
The divide is history took a detour and was rewritten.
It was rewritten by, get this,
relish factions of zealots, right?
This is not the average religious process.
These are zealots who did this to rewrite our history.
We didn't know, people here, now this is becoming
quite an interest, people are asking me in interviews.
What is it with these, with these,
the date of the Old Testament?
What is it with the fact that the thing may actually
be in Greek and it has nothing to do with Hebrew
and that Hebrew is a fabrication.
It's a resurrection of a dead language
that didn't do anything while it was alive.
And we have these all over the Mediterranean.
They usually just disappear, yeah, swallowed up
by the monstrous Amazon of ancient Greek.
If you haven't looked at her,
if you haven't looked at that queen,
oh God, let's bring more over here.
You know what we're gonna do tonight?
Leave her up there for just a second.
Thank you for the decency crosses.
Those are sponsored by the head
of the Sisters of Frustration.
Thank you.
Yes, look, oh, what is that by the way?
Is that a, is that a bird?
Talk of it, she's kind of like Snow White,
you know what I mean?
Yeah, talking to the birds.
Go to the next one.
Oh, love this, love this.
No, not your next one.
I meant my next one.
Thanks, thanks, Joey.
Don't get, you got a big head.
Now that I complimented you, you got a big head.
Okay, look, look, kitties.
It's the final days.
It's the ending, it's the completion.
And as you've heard, there are gonna be lots of,
look at the second line, first, second word in.
Antichristos, Antichristos.
What do you think an Antichristos is?
It's a drug that is an antidote to a Christ.
Do you know that's what they're saying
when they're saying Antichrist and Antiquity?
They're saying antidote.
Yeah, do you know what cancels the Christ,
the Antichristos?
It's a medical concept.
It's a medical concept.
Look, not only do you have to use drugs if you're Jesus,
but you've gotta use drugs if you're Jesus's followers.
If you don't, if you don't,
you don't have any place with him.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
But you don't know all things, right?
Who wants to know all things anyway?
Who wants their eyes to be open?
Wow, you'd be just like him.
And if you were Yahoo, you'd screw everything up.
Yeah, let's go back to the sources here.
People are like, I don't have time for this.
Let's go, I feel it.
Yeah, yeah, and you, you know what I mean?
Okay, now listen to this.
This is the creepy instructions.
And I say creepy only very, you know,
it takes a lot to creep me out, right?
I've seen a lot, man.
If you could know what these eyes have seen
from the ancient world, right?
Oh my God, the AI that they just put in prison
for being, for rendering images and decent.
She knows, what are these instructions,
these creepy instructions for?
He says, look, you gotta maintain that charisma, right?
You gotta remain in that state.
And when you are, nobody can instruct you.
There's no need, you won't need to be instructed.
Yeah, why?
Right, because the charisma is the thing
that is gonna lead you into all things.
That's how you will know.
That's how you will have no sis,
is you know the truth and the false.
Your eyes will be opened.
You say, wait a minute, am I living in a universe
where Yahoo is actually the bad guy?
Wouldn't it be funny?
Wouldn't it be funny?
That's what they're all doing in the underworld, right?
That's what they're all doing.
They're like, first issue is the child sacrifice.
Did anybody notice how high it's getting?
Did anybody notice?
Oh God, Yahoo is saying, yummy, yummy, yummy.
I love those babies.
Oh God, people asked me, is your name really almond?
Yes, my middle name.
My second middle name is almond.
Yeah, and my first name is David.
And why do I never, ever, ever use David?
Because David wiped out entire cities
of women and children.
Yeah, why?
To please Yahoo.
Yahoo's into the whole sacrifice.
Go get Isaac.
You know what I would say to Yahoo
if he told me go get my child to sacrifice them.
Yeah, yeah.
You don't see what's coming for Yahoo.
Yeah, we mourn Yahoo.
Yeah, we do.
I love it.
I love this, I love this.
Thank you so much.
Bring me those creepy instructions again.
I want people to be sure what they're supposed to do.
You gotta remain, you gotta remain in that state
that our drugs take you to
in order to know all things,
in order for your eyes to be opened.
You're not gonna be Adam, right?
We've got Ewa for you
and you're not gonna be Adam
if you don't have that fruit.
Love it.
Now you know why he said when he kicked Ewa
out of the garden, he said,
you're gonna have to have painful birth
for the rest of your life.
He's like a petulant little kid.
Yeah, you're gonna have, you go,
yeah, you're gonna have painful birth now.
Why?
Because he just kicked her out of the place
where they take the drugs
that allow you to induce painless birth.
Puts you into a semi-comatose state.
Still having those smooth muscle contractions.
Well, they can do that?
Yeah, they can do it with the drugs.
Isn't that amazing?
The first sciences were women's sciences.
Yeah, I told you guys, the X, Y thing, right?
The little Y chromosome is a little busted up.
Did you know we start as a girl?
Isn't that something?
I love that, I love that.
Yeah, the degeneration of the feminine is the masculine.
You know what?
Feed that in to some of the propaganda that comes out today.
Feed that in.
We are a degenerate form of an ideal woman.
We are degenerate forms of ideal women.
Do you wonder why we worship the mother?
Do you wonder?
Yeah, guess what?
Yahoo is gonna fill up the child's sacrifice, right?
Whether, it doesn't matter where it is
and what country's doing it.
Doesn't matter who's flagged their waving, right?
The ones that are killing children,
that echoes, that echoes through the quantum.
Yeah.
Okay, and that's how things change.
That's how catalysts reach that point
where they can boom, start working, convert everything.
Oh, love it, love it, hit it.
Hit the next one, bring up the sources.
These people, show me those Jesus pictures too, I love it.
This is what we need people
because this is going to be what takes you to that place.
Okay, this is how your eyes are opened.
This is how your eyes are opened.
People have been asking me,
does the Pope have this?
And I'm like, unless he's got a cup, he don't.
Yeah, yeah, they don't have, see,
they didn't cultivate, they didn't cultivate the vestals.
Didn't you ever wonder
whether Romans were so big on the vestals?
If you don't have vestals, you got nothing.
Your society's doomed to break down, right?
And who are those vestals?
Those are the keepers of the flame.
Those are the priestesses who set us on the right path.
Do you think those priestesses,
do you think you could get a teenage priestess
who's been trained in dance and song
and been fumigated and giving chemicals over time, right?
Oh, God, do you think that they care for anything,
but what is not in our societies?
You know, the things that drive our societies,
they're not interested in those things.
They're interested in justice, straight up,
straight up hardcore justice.
You hypocrites, you know,
spots hypocrites quicker than these highly educated,
protected, vestal priestesses.
Oh, God, they could teach you language,
you hot dwelling Roman, right?
Long tradition.
Would you be surprised?
Who's gonna be surprised to find out
when we find a library?
Wait, did that happen?
I think that happened already.
When we find a library and it's got her songs in it,
oh, just wait, just wait,
the Vatican's gonna crack in two, right?
Vatican, crack in two.
They have the real history now.
They've got the good stuff.
We found that library games over people.
All the book burners, big middle finger,
all the book burners.
Yeah, you lose.
You thought you could do something, but you lose.
We found it.
Victory, victory.
In our theosos, we celebrate the victory, right?
And that's why we're given the library.
Yeah, yeah.
She told him, she told him, he buried him.
Why did he bury him?
People are like, why did Neuma bury that stuff?
We're about to find out that he was involved
in a construction of past, present, and future
out of the mouth of a singer.
Profites, Vestal, who carried the flame.
Oh, Jesus Christ, what happened?
What happened when you drank that cup?
Do you remember, I wanna make this appeal to you tonight
because the devil told me, look,
you haven't really told them what the cup is.
They have to know, you know, he's like, they gotta know.
That cup that Jesus said, I don't want to drink from it.
He's like, yeah, he's like, I don't want to.
And he's stumbling, right?
He's stumbling in his three stoned disciples,
Peter, James, and John are off there falling asleep.
You can only take so much opium, right?
Before it knocks you out.
And they're knocking and he keeps trying to wake him up
and go back to his naked kid
who's in the middle of the garden with him, right?
And he's like, on his way back to the trudging,
he's like, oh God, I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
Please don't let me have to do this.
Do you know why he was saying that?
The devil wants you to know why he was saying that.
Yeah, Christians, close your ears,
because this is bad.
Yeah, yeah.
The cup is the person, in this case, the child.
Using these drugs, the body will then produce products.
And these products are central
to the functioning of the lace days and the mystery.
You can't be a Christ without drinking from that cup.
And that cup is a boy.
It's a naked boy.
It's a naked boy.
How do I know that?
Because I've seen the cup of Zeus.
They call him Ganymede.
You mean, wait a minute, you mean he drinks?
I mean, this is right.
He drinks from the boy.
Yes, he drinks from the boy.
Now, they used to make fun of this in the Pripyat poems.
Yeah, they used to make fun of it, right?
Drinking from Ganymede, you know what that means?
That's, in case you're not getting
the exact scientific historic picture
of Jesus and his boy cup,
he's drinking from his privates.
Yeah, yeah.
One author talks about the springs that are in the nether.
Yes, I don't know how to describe this
in the most scientific way possible
so that you can understand the Bible.
But these texts indicate the anus.
Colon was a place for the storing and processing of goods
that could be put to use in rites
with people who were interested in drinking
from the anus of a child.
When Jesus Christ, I know, I hate this part,
but you have to look at the reality,
no matter how painful it is.
When Jesus Christ with that naked kid
is drinking of his cup, it included anal consumption.
Yeah, yeah.
Now you know why those crusaders do,
they have that purple cross on their little underwear.
Yeah, don't, did you know that too?
You didn't know?
Oh, everybody knows it.
It was in the trials of the Templars.
Yeah, the Templars, they had little purple crosses
because it was the way that their anus
that had been coated with these Christing drugs.
I mean, you don't know people until you stood there
as a Templar, as this Christian order
and you get your newbies in,
and what do you do with your newbies?
You say, you can have one of two locations
from which my drug comes.
Yeah, that's just, that's how it works, man.
That's how it works.
Did you think that was odd?
Well, the Pope did and ended up smashing those people.
Right, he was like, no.
It was money.
There was money behind it, you know what I mean?
You know, it's the way it is.
The apostles were the boys from Galilee.
The boys from Galilee, yeah, is that a good one?
You people, exactly, who is this?
Merc, this is exactly, exactly what my comment is.
Merc, I'm with you, buddy.
You people are just sick, dirty, dirty, dirty sick people.
Now stop reading the Bible.
Put that thing down.
Step away, step away from the King James.
They're gonna burn him now, wouldn't that be funny?
You get a mob of Christians holding signs that say,
spare the children while they pay to have children killed.
Isn't that neat?
And by not helping children not get killed,
you're essentially endorsing the killing of them.
Right, so, wake up.
Wake up, you're in the hot seat.
Everybody's watching in the underworld.
Doesn't look good for you people.
Oh my God, dirty, you dirty, dirty Satanists.
Let's go on with the Bible.
Don't let them deter you.
Don't let them stop you.
We need this for the freedom.
Look at this.
Okay, yeah, okay, okay.
Now that this is the spirit of God, right?
Right, it's in the substance and the spirit.
Yeah, the spirit which agrees,
which endorses that Christ.
Yeah, where are they in the flesh?
Wait, what?
Oh, remember, our substances are coming from Him.
It's His blood and His flesh.
Did nobody see that when you were going to church?
Did nobody see that?
Yeah, didn't you think it was a little bit weird?
I mean, if you're gonna redeem a group of people,
do you think you're gonna go
through that whole eat my blood thing?
Yeah, eat my flesh, baby.
If I said to you, look,
they found me before they crucified me
in a public park with a naked kid
and I want you to eat my flesh.
Seriously, seriously?
Jesus loves you, almond.
I know He does.
That's the problem.
That's the problem, you know?
The dude gets arrested with a naked kid.
Does nobody care?
Oh my God, hit the next one.
Oh, who is this?
Am I going to hell?
No, the past for a better future.
That's nice.
That sounds like a six this.
Six this five.
Yeah, I think it's good.
Yeah, no, it's okay, you can be both.
Listen, yeah, I think that's something we'd see
in the state broadcast, the PBS thing, you know what I mean?
That's like a public announcement, yeah.
You should, right?
That's why this library that's been discovered
in 1770 or whenever it was, that's why it's so important.
Now we can read it, woo!
Yeah, we're going to burn up the world, baby.
It's lovely.
Couple more here, people, just hang in there with me.
Look, whoever doesn't agree about this whole Christing thing,
this is the Antichristu, yeah, the Antichristu here.
Yeah, oh, that's nice, that's nice.
So again, you have a Christing and an Antichristing.
And you know what happens when you get Antichristed?
The effects of the poison of the Christ
are reduced to nothing.
It's like a cure, right?
It's like a cure, fantastic.
Wait, what is that?
Amen is too old for Jesus.
What, I'm not quite sure what that means.
Chew is that, shake your head, does that make sense?
I don't know, I don't know.
But thanks, thanks for the comment.
Okay, let's go to the next one.
Oh, I love the input, by the way.
And you, you, my little kitties, right?
Nobody's going to be able to overcome you.
And he's talking to his children again, right?
This is one person, this is John.
It's one person who has been groomed within the right,
within the mystery, who is now doing the grooming.
This is the advancement of the generation
that is originally abused.
And people will say, oh, how dare you say that
about Jesus and those boys that he was around,
sleeping on the boat with, always naked around,
taking his clothes off to dry their little feetsies
that he'd been washing.
Where's that?
Do you have any of those kids in the boat with Jesus?
Bring them up, please Chewie.
Look, world, take this, take this.
Wait a minute, is that, yeah, there he is.
There he is, right?
Who's that grown man with those children in the boat?
It's Jesus the Christ.
It's Jesus the Christ, it is, look, there he is.
Does it look like him?
Okay, do you have another one?
Oh, here they are again.
Look, we got all sorts of pictures of these people.
Look, what are you doing, Jesus?
What are you doing with the kids in the boat?
Looks like a nasty seat.
Do you see a galley, really that bad?
Yeah, I guess it can be, it can be.
When you take your young kids out on the lake,
you sickos, as Merck would say,
when you take your little children with Jesus
out on the lake and they're waking up naked,
remember Peter wakes up naked and has to put his clothes on
in order to go talk to Jesus who was offshore
in his vampire form, I know that's complex,
but that's exactly what happens,
this is what the text says, man.
We don't have arguments, we have texts, love it.
Give me a couple more and we're gonna,
Mosey, because I wanna give you,
oh, I can see these big bold letters
and that makes me so, so fancy happy.
And what is this?
Yeah, yeah, we don't care.
Look at the second line, we're witnessing people buck up.
Look at the second line, word right in the middle.
Sotera, that's what this is all about.
Bring me up Sotera, bring me up Sotera.
Our chrisma allows us to testify
as to our Sotera, our salvation.
You know what the gospel is?
It's the salvation the drug gives you.
The gospel is the salvation the drug gives you.
You wanna know what they call him, the savior, right?
You wanna know why it's the gospel?
You wanna know why he's the Christos?
Okay, join the cult people, hit the next one.
Ooh, it's good, it's good, I can feel it coming.
This one's gonna really, ooh, and yeah, and then why?
And then someone, someone may be in the situation,
the right circumstances to say, look, here is,
oh, Christos, but don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him, why?
You mean there's wandering around Christoses?
Those are Christoi, if you want the ancients.
These Christoses, these Christs, they're walking around.
Yeah, did you know that that Christ is just the person
who's had that drug applied?
So their eyes are open, their prophets, physicians, healers.
You think he was the first on the scene?
No, he was just one of them that got caught with those.
With that naked boy and ended up getting crucified.
Yeah, next to another, and another next to him.
Yeah, fantastic, what is the Nancy?
I will never be able to think about hot cross buns
without gagging in my mouth, hot cross buns.
Yes, hot cross, Templar buns, throw that in,
call them Templar, we'll sell those at the store, right?
You can make a little cross, right?
A little purple cross right there.
No, but you had a choice Nancy, come on,
these are Templars, you had a choice between
whether it was the one that was on the taint
or the one that was on the head of the penis, right?
At least they're gonna give you that, you know what I mean?
I mean, because that's where the medicine goes,
it's where it dribbles, right?
If you knew somebody that was walking around
that had magic driblings from their anus,
you might be tempted to go to the places that, you know,
people go, yes, this is history, welcome,
nobody's gonna teach you this,
because nobody has the guts,
nobody has the guts to teach you.
This is a theosos that we've got.
We don't like the guts here, hit us with another one,
hit us with another one.
Oh, God, look how they translate this.
Oh, by the way, how are they translating
these geniuses or Bible scholars through the centuries?
How are they translating this?
As Messiah, did you know that doesn't appear?
It's Christ that appears, so thank you very much.
You can only appropriate so much before you're sated
and you satiate the world of demons.
There's only so much you can do.
That word is not there.
That was an attempt to appropriate the text.
Ah, wow, fantastic, yeah.
Yeah, no, it's not a Hebrew word at all.
It's not a concept even reflected anywhere.
Did you know, by the way, did you know?
I wanted everybody to know
that there is no appearance anywhere of the word Yahweh.
Yeah, no way, Yahweh.
There's no, there's no appearance of that word anywhere
in the Septuagint.
Yeah, how did it get there?
It was magic, kiddies.
It was magic.
It was written in later in order to appropriate,
to put a stamp on it, to lay claim.
Did you ever need to lay claim to something
that already belonged to somebody else, right?
You can appropriate it.
It's called appropriation.
Fantastic, fantastic, linguistic appropriation, yes.
And that's why you believe the fairy tale you do.
You didn't know Jesus was into drugs.
You didn't know his early followers were into drugs.
You didn't know that Paul was bombed on the venom.
You didn't know that.
Now you do, here it's all coming together
and our theosos, we have opened eyes.
Yeah, fantastic.
A couple more and we're done.
This is lovely.
I'm just getting two worked up people.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And what do we have here?
Look at the first line.
We're gonna end up getting Pseudo Christoi, Pseudo Christoi.
Listen to that, it's just got a nice ring to it.
Pseudo Christoi.
Oh, nice.
Yeah, Pseudo Christ.
Wait, what?
You got Pseudo prophets and Pseudo Christ, brah.
You can't prophesy without that, right?
You can't prophesy without.
Do you really think people who talk about Bible times,
if you use the term Bible times in your vocabulary, right?
You really think those prophets, the anointing,
was like a little bit of,
let's take a little all of them, whoop, whoop, right?
And all of a sudden the guy is seeing visions, right?
And going places, getting taken up by angels,
telling angels, falling over dead.
These prophets are junkies.
And you didn't know that, but now you do, right?
The history that we have as a people, as human beings,
has been appropriated, abused,
and reconstructed into a terrible, terrible lie.
You mean people will lie to me?
Seriously, are you human?
Yeah, what group will lie to you more than any other?
He can lie out of his mouth,
and people will still worship him.
People will still tear down everything around them
to worship the liar.
Yeah, to worship the liar.
Yeah, you don't see Lucifer doing that garbage.
You don't see Lucifer misleading like that.
No, you don't.
No, no.
Morningstar.
You mean it turns out our God is bad,
and the one we thought was bad was a propaganda bad?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're gonna find out when you get to the other side,
and you realize that blood,
it didn't wash off your hands.
And you know the one thing they don't put up with in hell
is somebody with a kid's blood on their hands.
They don't care what kind of God you worship.
You mean that's the reward of appropriation?
Yes, it is.
It is.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
Give us the last slide.
Second, yep, here's our pseudo prophets.
That's lovely.
You want after that, right?
Oh, and here's our, look at this, the concrete.
This is the monster.
Oh, I wanted you to see the things
that will be produced by the Christ, right?
Look at this.
These are marvels, wonders.
You know, that's how it's generally translated,
but you know what it actually says?
Look at it, it says dios, right?
Dios, aiohoio, these are the monsters,
the terrata, they call them.
What does the Christing produce?
It gives you the ability to produce the monsters.
The monsters, what kind?
You know, the face that was on Zeus's Aegis,
on God's Aegis, do you know what he carries there?
It's the face of Medusa.
She who guards by means of drugs.
Yeah.
You don't know what you're missing.
I want to thank you for coming tonight,
and I want to ask you to consider the theosos.
To consider, oh, yep, and here's the pseudo Christ, right?
Consider, you can drop it, good job, truly fantastic.
Consider, nothing got my go tonight.
Where'd Penelope go?
Can we just see Penelope once and remind everybody?
This is the reason that we remove the naughty bits, right?
It's to cover up, right?
The cross covers up that shame.
Isn't that nice?
Thank you, Penelope, I love you, I'll see you later.
Okay, let's go.
That's where we've reached rock bottom.
We're right there with the history.
Now you know, and you can't unlearn, right?
The reality that was Jesus Christ.
Thank you for coming tonight.
I want you to consider the theosos
and what happens when they become active.
This is our quest to bring the theosos back.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Thank you for your time.
Hail Satan.
