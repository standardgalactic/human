Night we're gonna look at Zoe's tree, I wouldn't jump right into things.
And I know that you're excited, and I know that you've looked at some of the background...
and that these are not brand new sources for you,
and a lot of you out there are ready.
But, I'm gonna trip you up,
and I'm going to bring you something that you probably haven't considered.
And this is a document that is part of a collection of...
of Greco-Roman magical papyri discovered from Egypt and you know somebody's somebody's garbage heap.
Yeah, and these are fantastic excerpts from the first century BC to Anno Domini fourth, fourth century roughly somewhere in that range.
It's a range of material and if you're really, really good with the Greek, you can distinguish between which texts are earlier and which are later.
So how do we, how do we get here and what does this have to do with the tree of Zoe?
So if we're going to find the tree of Zoe, you have to be within the garden.
And so today we're going to go meet someone who works in the garden.
Yeah, he is called a root cutter, but he has a very specific method for harvesting the daimones, the powers of the plants.
And it's very, it's a beautiful kind of mixture of religion and botany and chemistry and oracular vision all in one.
I call it the spirit of Oman, not because I am Oman, but because that is what the text calls itself.
It is the spirit of Oman.
It's nice.
Let's go. Let's just go there now for our initial text.
Could you call up the spirit of Oman, please?
Yeah, yeah.
Here's the Greek.
So I just want to show you.
I'll be working.
I'll be working with.
Yeah, pull that down.
Just by way of introduction, I worked with John Scarborough at University of Wisconsin Madison in the history of pharmacy.
And I was in the classics department there and he did the medical side.
So in addition to Madison, he did the drugs.
He did a lot of research on the drugs and he was a translator for the modern, the only modern edition in English that exists of these magical papyri.
Yeah, of these magical papyri.
And that's the Hans Dieter Betts edition.
Anyway, John Scarborough was one of those translators.
And yeah, we had a lot of fun.
We had a lot of fun talking about the nuances of the Greek and how hard it is to translate some of these texts.
It's brilliant stuff.
But that's how we get to these texts in the first place.
And so we're there.
We're going to bring.
I'm going to bring you a root cutter.
When somebody told me when the head of the department at University of Wisconsin told me that the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing.
With the drugs, right?
They just wouldn't do such a thing.
I started looking and I'm trying to break through to a populace of people that I think is now the time to break through.
They're bringing to see the value of these drugs in medicine.
So we're experiencing really a psychedelic renaissance, right?
Get our drugs banner up there.
Yes, it's a psychedelic renaissance.
So I'm taking you back to somebody who was there, who was collecting and using drugs in ritual.
Yes, the Romans would do such a thing.
And they did such a thing a lot.
And why don't we know this as moderns?
Why is it that Harvard keeps fingering us, right?
Why do they keep doing this?
Because these texts are not, they're hard, right?
You're going to have some botanical knowledge.
You're going to have some medical knowledge.
You have to, it's too much science.
And so it's much easier if you're at Harvard to read Homer than it is to read some obscure magical author who may be composing a beautiful dactylichexameter.
But you're just, you just don't want to go there.
And they're going to start going there.
A professor told me, a professor from Brown told me it would take 10 years.
So I want to take you ahead to that place where that gardener is.
And I want to look at that gardener.
So let's just pull up, I'm going to pull up the Hans Dieter Betts.
Now our translation by O'Neil, I think this was done.
They don't, they don't translate the word rootcutter.
I'll show you it in the text.
He translates it herbalist.
The word is literally a rootcutter.
What is a rootcutter?
These are weird, weird, weird people, right?
Rootcutters are the ones that go out and they paint their bodies and they perform nocturnal rituals, right?
And they harvest, where they harvest their drugs and they imbue their drugs with the life of the dimod.
Yeah, it's, it's another one of these, if you're a goace, you understand it.
It's another one of these art that the suns of God passed on to their offspring.
Yeah, this pharma case, right?
Yeah, this sorcery.
So I'm giving you original sorcery.
I want us to look at this guy at the rootcutter and tell him how we get to the tree of Zoe.
We have to be facing Adam, right?
We have to be facing Adam.
So I want you to face her mentally in these images that we're about to run through.
But let's, before his cadaver gets too cold, let's pull him out here.
And let's get him on the show.
Can you bring up the Hans Dierbett text, please, in the English? Thank you.
Yeah, I want to read this one.
Is that, I'm sorry, let me just, yes, there we go.
So I'm going to read this to you and I'm going to stop a couple of times and make a couple of comments from the Greek things that are relevant.
Yeah, so let's go.
Gorgiousness and gorgiosity.
And you know, in order to get there, we need to go through the dark harbour.
So I will show you the dark harbour's relevance in just one minute.
But let's read together, shall we?
Among the Egyptians, herbs are always obtained like this.
The herbalist, there's our rootcutter.
The herbalist first purifies his own body.
First he sprinkles with natrin and fumigates the herb with resin from a pine tree after carrying it around the place three times.
Burning kiffy and pouring the libation of milk as he prays, he pulls up the plant while invoking by name
the daimon to whom the herb is being dedicated.
Isn't that nice?
And calling upon him to be more effective for the use for which is being acquired.
So this is, this is somebody that we're collecting, you know, we're in the process of collecting plants.
All right, we're hanging out with somebody who now has a vast botanical knowledge and knows what plants do what to you.
And on top of that, we've put on this, this natrin, right?
Which is just sodium bicarbonate, right?
It's just, it's just baking soda.
You know, and anyway, but for some reason we're sending ourselves to these plants and you see this a lot with the different rootcutters.
You can find other rootcutters, other places.
You need to know that Sophocles was writing, he wrote a trilogy, one of the titles of which is the rootcutters.
So this is a fantastically important area in antiquity.
Euripides mother is one of these rootcutters.
Yeah, a risotomist, if you want to use the term that comes directly from the Greek.
Good, the risotomoi, the rootcutters is an entire place.
So we have this individual, this occupation, who is getting himself ready to collect these plants and to be able to.
And what's he going, what's he going to do?
Look at the invocation that comes up.
He speaks over any herb generally at the moment of picking is as follows, right?
Now here we go.
Here's the part.
If you're performing, if you're involved in the Saturnian magic, or if you're performing satanic magic, you are now entering the images in order to unlock the potential of the diamond.
You have to have these things in your head.
It's quantum physics.
Do I understand it?
No.
The symbol in on the Vatican said you have to work or trust the allegory.
Right.
Right.
That's what's that's what's that's how it works.
Okay, so sit with the image.
What images you were sown by Kronos.
Why don't you I'm going to read this and I want you to bring up the images please.
You were sown by Kronos.
Nice.
You were sown by Kronos.
And that word for sown there is literally to throw the seed at right to implant the seed.
Right.
So Kronos is the seed implanter.
Yeah.
You were conceived and it is an excellent translation.
It is conception literally right because look at the line below will have birth.
So these are different images that you're creating.
Who is the one who conceives.
Hey, right.
Right with her son.
And how does she work.
She works through Venus.
What.
Yes.
She works through the curses.
The.
Okay.
Just just hang on.
You weren't there.
But now you're coming to the meetings.
You can start to hear the names.
You're going to start to know the images.
So I need you to have the image of Kronos.
And I need you to have the image of Hera.
Right.
Hera is the queen of Queens.
And Kronos as the power of the degrading power of time.
Yeah.
Love that.
The corrosive.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Anyway.
You were maintained.
And why Kronos?
Because we're saturnians brah.
We're here.
Right.
We're here for the sake of Satan.
Right.
Or saturnas.
Right.
Very good.
The STR.
Some of you in the comments tonight.
You were talking about Ishtar and S start.
The STR.
Inanna too.
Somebody threw inanna in there as well.
The great comments.
The STR root or the Sigma tau row root.
I will argue is Greek.
It is Mycinian.
It's where we get our word.
Sotera.
You know, savior.
Salvation.
It's the word we get.
Historia from the word.
The inquiry that we ask an oracle.
The question is the Historia.
Right.
It's the root.
We get Oestros from.
What is Oestros?
That's that stuff we put on our bows.
The purple.
The midwives use it to induce delivery.
To induce delivery.
Yeah.
It's got some kind of oxytocin function.
Beautiful.
I used to cut open brains.
There's nothing more beautiful than the human brain.
Seriously.
Okay.
Let's keep reading.
Cronus.
You were sewn by Cronus.
You were conceived by Hera.
You were maintained by Amon.
You were given birth by Isis.
There she is.
Okay.
You were nourished by Zeus.
Which Zeus?
The God of rain.
God of rain.
Interesting.
Okay.
Now I know where I am.
If I'm clever and I've read a lot of these texts.
Now I know where I am in time and space.
And what pantheon I'm dealing with.
This is old Helios.
This is the star and the moon.
The sun and the moon and the stars.
That's what this is.
Gorgeous.
Okay.
You were given birth by Isis.
You were given growth by Helios and dew.
Mention his name.
There he is.
Helios.
Nice.
Nice.
And what is that dew?
What is that dew that it's talking about?
Can we?
Can we?
Yes.
Oh, lovely.
Lovely.
Can we show you the drosos?
Yes.
Look at this.
Dew.
Dew is a nice, you know.
Remember we're with the Victorians.
We're trying to get with Alice, right?
Oh, in poets.
It's pure water.
Yeah.
There's even a mistress of the dew.
Mistress of the dew.
You ought to start paying attention to this.
Mistress of the dew.
Notice that we have Qatar ice.
We have purifications involved here.
What?
Look at number three of other liquids that dew,
which is of the vine, right?
Oh, that's nice.
So you mean that stuff that makes us feel funny?
Yes, exactly.
Right?
Good.
It can even be the young.
The young.
Right?
The young.
Yw dew.
Yw dew.
What is that stuff we drank from the cauldron?
It's dew.
Nice.
Love it.
Hold on.
Hold on to the images.
You.
You.
Are the dew of all the gods.
Remember who?
What happened?
Did somebody start using drugs?
What's going on?
There's a guy who is doing drugs.
What's going on?
There's a guy who is digging up.
It doesn't have to be a man either.
It can be a woman.
There are midwives who are digging out these substances
and getting their accoutrements on and having their energised.
They pick it at the right time.
He's going to tell you.
I picked you at the right time, the right place, the right hour.
Right?
They're picking this according to the stars, right?
According to Venus.
It's why they're sitting out there while Venus is there.
They're collecting their herbs.
Right?
Collecting.
Did they use drugs in antiquity?
My goodness.
Look at this.
An entire papyrus about it.
Okay.
Fantastic.
This is gorgeous.
Okay.
Let's see.
You are the dew of all the gods.
You are the heart of Hermes.
You are the seed of the primordial gods.
You are the eye of Helios.
You are the light of Selene.
Isn't that nice?
And just so that you understand what cult that we're in a mystery cult,
he's going to bring up the resurrection.
You are the zeal.
That burning energy of Osiris.
The resurrected.
Yeah.
Isn't that nice?
Yeah.
You are the beauty and the glory of Uranus.
You're the beauty and the glory of Uranus.
Do you know what happened?
Do you know what Cronus did?
He castrated Uranus.
He castrated him.
And what happened when he castrated him?
Blood from his severed penis splattered on the earth.
And when it combined with earth made the furies,
the true enforcers of decay.
Right?
We as Satanists, we do not have right.
We do not have right.
We have reason.
The Taliban, the evangelicals, the Orthodox,
they have right and morality on their side.
We have reason and reason always leads us to justice.
Always leads us to justice.
And how do we find her through the mysteries?
It's exactly what you're doing.
We're seeing that figure.
Okay.
Let's keep going then.
Let's keep going then before our root cutter gets out of my control.
Yes.
Yeah.
So he listen to you.
You're the heart of Hermes.
You're the heart of Hermes.
Do you know what the heart of Hermes is?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
You're the seed of the primordial gods.
Right.
Remember that thing about the guarding of the seed?
The head and the heel?
Yeah.
It's the terror in Latin.
In Greek.
Excuse me.
And it means to be watchful over something.
Yeah.
Keep that in mind.
The images, right?
That I'm giving you.
I'm feeding you the images so that you can do the magic.
You are the light of Selene.
I of Helios.
You are the zeal of Osiris.
We're back in a Bacchic banquet.
You are the beauty and the glory of Uranos.
You are the soul of Osiris.
Osiris is Daimon.
Yeah.
Okay.
You are the soul of Osiris is Daimon.
So exalt yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why are we exalting ourselves?
We revel in every place.
Because we are the spirit of Amon.
We are the spirit of Amon.
Do you know the spirit of Amon?
Do you know the periclepe?
Yeah.
It's good stuff.
It's good stuff.
Don't get too deep.
Don't pull your head out from that.
Think about where you are and everything.
Yeah.
As you have exalted Osiris.
So exalt yourself.
And rise just as Helios rises each day.
Your size is equal to the zenith of Helios.
Your roots come from the depths,
but your powers are in the heart of Horus.
Whoops.
It should be Hermes.
Art of Hermes.
Your fibers are the bones of Nevis.
Show us the sacred bull.
Will you show us the sacred bull?
Yeah.
Who are we worshiping?
We as Saturnians.
We as Satanists.
Who are we worshiping?
And your flowers are the eye of Horus.
Your seed is Pan's seed.
Why is he saying these things?
We're still talking to the plant, right?
We're still talking to the plant.
We're capacitating that plant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Give us the power, right?
He wants it.
Knows further down Aries and Athena, right?
We know what they do.
We know what the Arai do, right?
We know what Aries really is
and why she originally is that power
that we crave to be able to bring decay.
Arai.
Are you one of the Arai?
Are you one of these furies?
One of these curses.
They all can translate that curse.
Hera, you should hope that you are
equal to the queen of queens.
Yeah.
A start in Ishtar, right?
S-T-R.
Oestras 4.
It's so that we can enter this miraculous state.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
I am acquiring you with good fortune
and good diamond.
That's a little bit.
Yeah.
After you read enough of this PGO,
you'll begin to see the physics.
He's using the eudaimonic, right?
The eudaimonic and he's throwing in just a hint of necromancy
with the touche, right?
I told you guys, if you want to make this work,
the state's attorney in magic,
you have to resort to randomization, right?
You have to resort to the sortace.
It's a physical principle of the binary cosmos,
the bi-dimensional cosmos that we inhabit now.
Thank you, MIT, for enlightening us all.
After saying this, he rolls the harvested stalk
in a pure linen cloth,
but into the place of its roots,
they threw seven seeds of wheat in equal number of barley.
Oh, that's nice.
He's putting something back.
He's putting something back
instead of just taking away everything.
That's a nice gesture.
He mixes them with honey.
I don't know why.
I don't know.
It's some botanist.
I need to tell us what's going on here.
After pouring in the ground,
which he has dug up, he departs,
and he is going to be doing something with this drug
that he has harvested.
He's going to be using the very powers
that we were calling upon, right?
It's an oral incantation.
It's images that, as he's digging up the plant
with his protective gear on, right?
Because that's all that is that's shown here by Carmen.
It's a protective gear for a botanist
who's into pharmacology.
Wonderful, wonderful stuff.
He's burning incense in the process,
and he's fumigating.
He's not in the beginning.
With the pine resin, the retcine,
he is creating a templum,
a space where the power of that God can exist.
These are idolaters.
They don't just call them idolaters
because they have giant stone temples.
They do have giant stone temples,
but they call them idolaters
because their actions are based on the Adolon.
The Adolon.
When you make an Adolon, say you're in training,
and you're supposed to carry out an assassination,
let's just start with that, an assassination.
What you are doing is you have to first bring your Adolon.
You have to construct your Adolon.
It's an image.
Then you take this image,
you purify the space around it
so that it can be filled with the Daimonis,
with the powers.
Then you take that thing that you've purified,
that thing that you've imbued.
You can do this with people too.
The thing that you've imbued with the spirit,
they call those force possessions.
That's a beautiful area of ancient magic, necromancy.
Imagine force possession.
It's like VR, but active.
It's a real VR.
Control somebody from a distance, like remote control.
Anyway, and they've got death.
You're going to enter into one of these crafts.
You have to be able to know how to charge those substances,
to charge those instruments.
Those are all instruments from which you are able to bring that power
from that dimension that's overlapping ours to this one.
You get a lot of explanations,
ancient explanations of the actual physics
behind all of this binding and how it works.
Who knows, maybe some of the people will find some interest
in that kind of thing.
I think we are just about over.
I'll just wrap up.
Can you bring up with the Bible study?
You're saying, wait a minute.
I thought we were studying Bible.
We are.
We're studying the garden and where you have to start.
Where you have to find there is the tree imbued with the power
to open the eyes, right?
And you have to go to that guardian who is there,
that one who's teddy, the one who is guarding that source
and imbuing it with power, giving it the power
so that our eyes can be open.
You have to face Adam.
Notice the text says you have to face Adam.
That's where you find paradise.
And remember that the Chaldeans have oracles
that thankfully got recorded.
And in those oracles, they talk about the physics behind this,
the generation, for example, of the Hecatech spear.
That's what we're doing.
We're using that lightning.
They call it lightning in order to create a space
where that power can be housed and manipulated.
When we take our aid along, when we take our idol,
that we're going to strap around our neck
or bury our neighbors' front step to their domicile
or that we're going to take to a temple and offer a temple
and wear all the time and freak people out.
When we do that, we offer to those,
that Adola, those images, we offer to them food
and clothing and shelter.
And if you are a Christian, you do not eat
what we have offered to Hecatech,
because if you do, you might develop that resistance
that Paul has to the snake venom.
And if you don't, you might have a problem with it.
Two out of three of these, we end up with troubles
when they're infants, two out of three babies at least.
That's what our death count is.
Those are the best stats we can get.
Two out of three babies die that go through this process.
Yeah, but the one that's generated from it,
that's a son of God.
Yes, now do you see?
Now, some people talk to Satan.
That's the conclusion of our Bible study.
I want you to know that what I'm doing
is I'm setting your orientation to Adam
so that we can approach the tree of Zoe.
It belongs to Zoe, right?
It's Zoe's tree, the thing you call the tree of life.
You don't even know it's Zoe's tree belongs to her.
We have to have a gardener to get us.
We have to stay real.
We have to stay with the gardener.
If we really want to do this
and we really want to talk to Satan,
if we want to bring those images in alignment,
so that we can see with eyes open,
if we really want to do that,
we have to stay rational.
We have to stay reasoned.
So it's not to fall into the grips of any faith
or any dogma.
Remember, we are Satanists.
We don't have faith.
We don't have dogma.
We have reason.
So I'm going to, is we delve deeper into the garden
and we come across the elwa
and we find the tree.
I can be guiding you in the images
that will allow you to have opened eyes.
So thank you tonight for the stage one,
the Greek Magical Papyri.
Lovely stuff.
If you're ever in the mood
for some interesting reading,
I recommend to everybody to be reading
the Greek Magical Papyri.
I know that some of you read Lord Byron
and I know that others of you are reading
other Petrarch.
I think somebody dug into some Petrarch,
the secret that I told you to get into.
So these are all,
if you'll notice in a kind of an eerie way,
there seems to be the same cult
that is expressed over time.
Just to give you a heads up,
it's a Renaissance thing.
I want you, somebody in the group,
to be able to read Boccaccio.
And I want you to see how he has taken her
and he has split her from an individual,
from a vampress, from a half viper,
half virgin.
He has taken her and he has split her
into different lives
so that you can see the eternality
of the Soteta.
You can see her.
Remember Jesus is a vampire with breasts.
We know that by now.
He's wearing the women's lingerie
in the book of the Apocalypse.
People don't like to look at it.
But there it is.
He's wearing the sexy lingerie
and he's got the breasts.
And some of the early Christian authors
talk about his life-giving milk
that comes from his breasts.
Why?
Because Soteta, the savior,
has life-giving milk.
And it says he's got a womb too.
It says he's got a womb.
Why?
Sometime we're getting too close
to the hermaphrodite,
to show you the hermaphrodite,
right?
To find her.
Yeah, the goddess of war.
Gorgeous, gorgeous.
The place that we all come is the grove of Mars.
Why?
Why do we all come to the grove of Mars?
Because that is where we get
that little bit of lineage
of Hele,
or Aira,
that queen of queens,
the Pambasilea,
right?
And she is, if I recall you that up and show you,
she is that Venus.
And you'd be surprised because you'd be like,
I didn't know Hera was that.
Yeah, guess what?
It's Trinity.
And she is a virgin mother queen
who is desire.
Everybody's always shocked.
That freshman in college,
love to ask this.
Who is the best looking goddess?
Right?
Who is the best looking goddess?
And they don't understand,
they don't understand that
as in the contest
of Paris,
of which goddess deserves
the golden apple,
right?
As was pointed out
with that entire,
everything business,
the
apple belongs to the Trinity
of the virgin,
the queen of queens,
and desire.
Yeah,
it's gorgeous,
it's gorgeous,
and they understand it.
Okay, I would like to ask if we have,
I'm going to look at your comments
and maybe flash a couple
of comments up here that are directly relevant.
So,
let me just go here.
Let's see here.
Yeah, somebody,
you don't have to flash a comment up.
What about Dante?
Doesn't Dante have a civil?
Ew.
Okay, you who wrote that about Dante,
call up his ghost,
find us the civil,
find us the burning purple,
would you do that please?
Thank you.
No, that's right.
Hey, there's another one here.
Let's see what we got here.
Are you telling me the wound in Jesus' side
was his vagina?
Absolutely not.
He's better than that, right?
No, absolutely not.
But you know what came out of that wound when they poked him?
Because he was already dead.
Most people don't realize that.
They were surprised that he was already dead.
It takes long to die from crucifixion, right?
It's not blood loss, you're not dying from blood loss.
Yeah, so
you're dying from strangulation,
slow strangulation.
Anyway,
you had to be there, right?
And the guys that were there, they poked him.
They poked him in the side
because they didn't know why he was dead.
They were like, dude, it's faking it, right?
Here, Lanson,
when they spilled out all that water in that blood,
dude was thirsty, drinking lots of water
just like
we know that they do
when they're under the influence of the dipsass.
Yeah, in the mystery.
It makes you really thirsty, it gives you polydipsia.
Yeah.
There's an antidote for it.
They tried to give Jesus the vinegar on the cross.
Right?
Vinegar, that word vinegar,
is their word in the geoponica
for the antidote to the dipsass.
Which would make you be yelling out and
thirsting.
So are there any drugs that are being used?
Not only are there drugs
that are being used in these texts.
Not only did the Romans
use drugs,
but your entire history
of what you have thought Christianity
was
is
because of its drugs.
You have no idea
of no ideal.
You have no idea why
the Pope pardoned Mary Magdalene
for using sex drugs,
for possessing sex drugs.
You have no idea, right?
It's a whole world we have.
It's not made it through the filter.
Okay, let's go to more questions.
Yeah, Jesus wore women's lingerie.
Can you tell us more?
Yeah, go to the apocalypse
and watch him.
You know, I had a
I had a student this week
tell me
I was working with her
in some Greek literature.
We were doing Plato
symposium.
We were talking about
Eros and who is Eros.
What that means
we were with the Socratics
and the flute girls
and Alcibiades
was getting kind of out of hand.
Anyway, they got some stuff going on.
But
in the
process
I
asked her to convey
to someone
the
idea that
you are worshiping
you are worshiping Lucifer.
You don't realize it, but you are satanic
as it stands right now.
How could you possibly say that?
If you are an evangelical
you are
practicing a satanic
or saturnian mystery
and you say, no, I'm not
I'm not doing that.
Well, let me
show you how you are.
The saturnian
savior is called
the morning star
or the bringer of dawn
and that he she
wears lingerie
and that he she
is your Jesus
and
the response will be no
Jesus is not yes look at Jesus
in the book of the apocalypse
where he says
I Jesus
am the morning star
all dressed up
right?
He's got the girdle on and everything
yeah
it's gorgeous
your part if you are a
what is the real wrinkle here
is that if you are a
an evangelical
if you are practicing Christian
right a follower of the faith
you are following
a saturnian
or satanic mystery
yeah
it turns out QAnon
is
turned upon its own head right
because the baby essence
drinkers are
the followers
of the Christ
yeah isn't that weird
yeah
it makes you feel kind of disoriented
let's see what other
what was the deal with Noah and his wife
daughter as Noah is related to the Argos
yeah
and Jason that's a wonderful question
you did that rat king nice job rat king
I like the name by the way
are you some kind of gangster
or something
we need gangsters
for our satanic congregation
what was the deal with Noah
and his wife slash daughter
yeah the Sybil
she says in her song
she says she's that wife slash daughter
yeah gorgeous
what is he doing with his arc
what is he doing with his container
his wife
tries to burn
well she didn't try to she burns it three times
most people think arc
boat fantastic
we're all set nobody
knows that his wife came out and burned it
three times
burned it
yeah
and that word for arc can be a box
used in a mystery
right
yeah he was the man of
righteousness
and he was that man of righteousness
because of his
initiation
he was the one who was preserving
the rights
remember this isn't the generation
when the sons of god came into
the daughters of men
and they taught them all that drugs
and they taught them all this
the astrology and they taught them
all the geometry
I don't know why so bad I learned geometry
they taught them the crafts
that it was necessary
metalworking
the metalworking and the way to manipulate
the fire
we need Hephaestus
we need Hephaestus
that fire
what are you talking about
I'm talking about another dimension that you cannot see
right
and that's how you access this
Saturnian mystery
is through seeing you have to have your eyes open
I don't want you to come in here and say
I've been baptized
I feel like a different person
no I want you to see
in a way
that relates a reality to you
that you haven't known
when you realize you've
suddenly seen and you're awake
you realize your life beforehand
was sleep
was sleep
yeah so
it's time for the sleeper to awaken
yeah fantastic
right it's resurrection don't you guys
want to be resurrected
yeah remove the goddess
desecrated the divine feminine
and made young boys the heart of the mystery
you said it happened before Christians
was it Pythagoras
right at the beginning
is a great question
Lord Snappy
yes
right from the beginning
as the right is emerging
there is a movement
to make it into
a boys
only initiation
and it's done
by examples put all over the Mediterranean
under
the name
of
Heracles
the glory of Hera
the glory of Hera
do you see that we're back to the original trinity
that's in the mystery
and Heracles is known
in his cult
it's only men and boys
it's
the Rastea
and why is it men and boys because it was
a woman
and a boy
and the only woman that's allowed
to come to these cult
activities
is one that's the Medwa
the Medea
that's it she can only come in
and why is that
why is that because
it's her dark harbor
right Hera in her orific hymn
is
the one
who remains within
who functions within
the dark harbor
the dark harbor that we were talking about
right we're working on this formula
and we know that the Galene
allows us to function
right the Helaudia
allows us Helaudia
allows us to function within the dark harbor
yeah
nice so who took her out
if I was
have to give an academic answer
I would
