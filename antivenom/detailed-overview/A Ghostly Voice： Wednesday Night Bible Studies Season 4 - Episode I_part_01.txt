There we go, good
Look at this, who is this?
This is the tenth
Him in the Orphic hymns
Yeah, and who is this?
This is nature
Nature for everybody who says
Those people worship nature
Bad
Those people that do that
Historically, and there are always
There are always people that do that
These are the people that are doing that
Those people are not liking them doing
And I just want you to notice
In the top line, this is nature herself
And she is that all mother
She is that all mother
You know what beats a Nazi?
A mother
Yeah, it's crazy
I don't know the physics I don't get
But that's what the psychologists say
Post WW2
That's nice
I want you to notice that
Polumejane is on that first line
Polumejane
Yeah, she has many ways of doing things
That was not an earthquake
She has many ways of doing things
Yes, she has great intelligence
Yeah, she does not need the mail
You know, that's what she...
Read the text
Read the text, yeah
She does the father and the mother
Yeah, wow
Who is this?
Who is this?
I want you to just...
I want you just to notice
All of the old, old, old Greek forms
That we've gotten this
And notice there's a cosmetera
Oh my God
She is that cosmic, complete mother
That starry-faced asteropy
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
The selasphora
Isn't that nice?
The bringer of that light
That torch
Yeah, these are nightly rites
Remember, we're working in...
We're working in...
Environment of nicks
These are offerings to nicks
That we're performing
Fantastic
Okay, give me the second part of that text
Hang on, one second
No, let's see
We're looking for the pantocratera
Help me look here, people
It'll be a little game
Oh, here it is
It's online, one, two, three, four
Look on that fourth line down that first word
Pantocratera
There's what we're looking for
That was the meat underneath
You guys thought we were lost
Don't worry, Aphrodite is with us
And it doesn't hurt
It doesn't hurt
To have that motherly love
When Addis is being educated
Right?
You understand?
This is the cult
This is the cult
This is the pre-Christian
Orphic cult
Bronze age
That you people had took over
I'm talking to you evangelicals
You know what I'm talking about?
Your savior
Your Jesus Christ
I'll show you the Christed one
I'll show you, he took it
It's all feminine modeling
It is
Anyway, on the fourth line down
Look, we've got the pantocratera
She is that one
When Jesus says I am
He's doing it with the oracular
I am, I was
And I will be
Remember, be practical
You can make lozenges
Things like little pills
That size
And you make them out of drugs
You make them out of drugs
And you take the drugs
You take that down
We'll put the next one up in a second
You take those drugs and you stick them
Into your rectum
Because that's how the medication is applied
And that's why I say the angels always have
Their middle finger is stinky
Right?
Because they have the seals
Don't you think when John was having his vision
After he breaks the seal
Do you know that's an expression
For administering a suppository?
Oh, you didn't
I'm sorry, it can also be for the vagina
Yes, yes
Okay, so angels
Middle finger, smells
