Yes, when you were in Sodom and Gomorrah
You've got to learn the rules
Yes, definitely
Let's go on
This is pleasurable
And you people are crazy for being here
Absolutely crazy
But we'll show you the alpha and the omega
You guys want to see it?
We'll show you
Remember, we're toning
The Greeks are using their vowels
As celestial spheres
And they are tuning their logos
Yeah, fantastic, fantastic
It's like a fetus
It's like a fetal pie
Let's go
Is anybody else hungry?
Let's go to the next
Let's go to the next...
Yeah, this is way...
Yeah, this is...
Let's go to the Pantocratera
There we go, this one
Excellent, yeah
I just wanted you to see, by the way
They list the Orphic hymn 10-4
Just keep that in mind
That's the one that we're looking at
Okay, let's keep going down
Yeah, let's go down there
I want you to see the verb meadow here
Yeah, protector rule
Yeah, used by Homer
That med root
And Roman numer number two, meadow my
To provide for the mindful
To plan or contrive or devise
Let's go to the next one
Okay, look at this med root
Medeon from meadow
One who, you know, rules a ruler
A guardian, a guardian
Wait, look at number two
What, medusa?
Guardian goddess of Aphrodite
It's used of Aphrodite
Did you know that Aphrodite was a medusa?
Oh, I don't think you did
But it's sexy, isn't it?
It's incredibly sexy
What else is it used of?
Nemosinie
Everybody knows who that is, right?
Take it down for a minute
Put it back, right, Becca?
Nemosinie
Let's hear something from Nemosinie
Mother of the Muses
Remember that
Remember her name
Yes, remember
Okay, let's go back
Go back to that same
We found Nemosinie
Yep, yep, yep
And then just look down
Who else?
Nemosinie is there
Oh, a palisthenia
Oh, that's nice
The virgin
The virgin medusa
Of course, everybody knows
Everybody knows that the virgin
Is associated with this toxicology
Of the medusa
Who are the rulers
And if you look down here, it's great
You see Artemis
You see Artemis and the toxon
Oh, and you know
Take it off
You know you've landed squarely
In that Bronze Age cult now
As soon as you see Aeropoison
You know, okay
Let's go one more with med
Last one with the med
Yeah, here, maydomae
Now, when I look, we adjusted
Look what we're doing, people
You cannot learn this somewhere else
And it would be wrong to ever charge
For this
It would be wrong
We, everybody here has a right
To know this stuff
I wouldn't say it's a right
I'd say it's some kind of cosmic privilege
Yeah, cosmic privilege
Let's look, let's tune
Let's tune, look what we're doing
This one's maydomae, right
We're lengthening that vowel
What happens when we skip
Skip one of the holy spheres
And jump from three to four
Right, what happens
To plan and do cunningly or skillfully
To plot and contrive to invent
To take care by watching, okay
Let's go one more
And what happens when we, go ahead
And what happens when we turn that up like that
Look at that, that vowel is longer
All of a sudden we get genitals
Genitals
And look who they cite
Andromachus, Apu Galen
You people, you people
Look what you've got
Urine, fantastic
Take that down, fantastic
We ended up with the urine
Right, because that's where it comes from
