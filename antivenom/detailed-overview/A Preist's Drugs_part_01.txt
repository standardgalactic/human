Run off Jesus
They're going to catch up with him sometime
I'm warning you
We're going to catch up with him
All right, kids, if you're in a park late at night
And somehow you end up without your clothes on
Don't go to Jesus
Because he's going to get arrested
He's going to get arrested, right?
Okay, I'm not a trafficker
Bring it, bring it
Put that in, let's go
New material, these dogs are hungry
They want the new stuff
Watch what happens, people
Right?
Oh, God
Oh, God
You know how you can take these?
You can take these venom directly from the creature
Isn't that nice?
Directly
Or you can put them into a poma
You can put them into a potion
Oh, what kind of potion would that be?
I'm passing it out to everybody now
I want you to see this ancient potion
You know what it's called?
It's cyanic death
Black death
Everybody, welcome black death
Are you ready?
What kind of cult is this?
Don't worry
Trust me, the resurrection will be there
You'll all be born again, right?
Everybody that has ears can hear me
Go to the next one
Oh, love it
Where's her image?
You know what she is?
She's subtle
Who is this woman that he's looking for, Martha?
He's looking for the first Christ
For those of you who've just joined in
And we've got her, we captured her
She's here, it's fantastic
It's the fulfillment of everything
That the evangelicals have been waiting for
It's gorgeous
Where's the beast?
Love it, bring the next one
She's Wiley, notice who else was Wiley on that?
Notice who else?
Look, look, look
Calypso and Kierke
Boy, these daughters of the sun
These women are notorious
They are notorious, man
I kind of want to get caught
Have you ever found that way?
Have you ever been hunted?
And you're kind of like
I don't know, I sort of want to get caught
You know what I mean?
This is her
This is who we're looking for
Oh, God, did we not make it obvious enough?
Look, it's printed on this
Noggin, go, hit us a nut, yes
Oh, look at this, oh, oh, oh
This is the poem on May Day
This is why I brought you guys here
Don't worry about the form of May Day
We're going to, who is this?
We're going to jump into this doctor
Look, I'm going to be flashing you
Some of this doctor who works with Nero
And I'm going to be giving you the potion
Look at her, right in the face, right?
We've got Medea here, ready?
This is the priestess
We're looking at her, she's got her potion
Fantastic, and it's okumoran
That's not good, that's not good
It's that potion of black death
Are you ready? Are you ready for it?
Oh, we need to get some
Go, go, go, who is this?
Oh, who is this Bakant?
Who is this Bakant with the purple?
Who is she? I'm looking
Is she out there? This is fantastic
Go to the next one, Chewie
Bring us the, oh, we got to slide these sources
And faster people are going to be like
You know, I got to party somewhere
You know what I mean, right?
This, people, what are we doing tonight?
We're going to the dark harbor
We're going to the dark harbor, right?
If you have the galene
You don't have to worry
You're safe in the dark harbor
We're looking for Galene
That's who we're looking for, aren't we Chewie?
That's fine, give me the next reference
We're getting closer to her
Come here, shh, everybody quiet
Can you see her? I'm going to coax her in
Are you ready? Ok, the Greeks, right?
They use this thing called Helenion
Or Helenion, it's in the genitive here
What do they do with this thing?
It looks like the name for Greek
It looks like it's from the root
Hellenist, oh my God
What do they do with this stuff?
It's a drug, the Greeks have it
And they use it, I'm telling you what Galen
Just, he was telling me, go, go to the next one
Boom, and what does this thing do?
Oh, it's used by the Dacians
The Dalmatians, what do they do?
They put it on the tips of their arrows
All the arrow poison that we've been talking about
Galen is telling us who is doing it
And who is using it, so the stuff that was found
At the site, the henbane, jump on board people
Here it is, get the next one
What are they going to do with it?
What is she going to do with it most importantly?
Look at this, Ezekius, right?
Says it's the claymata, says it's what?
Says it's the clayma
And what is that?
It's the tendrils of the vine
Can you feel the tendrils of the vine?
If you don't, you don't have ears to hear
Oh, I see, this is some of the strange mystery
Called stuff, yes
So when they stop us at the door
And they ask you if you've got the tendrils
Tell them you do, tell them you do
Please, next source
That's how you get in people, right?
They're not going to let you in, otherwise
They're going to be putting crosses
You know why that guy's going to cross there?
Yeah, yeah, I do too
Fig leaves just don't cover enough
In some cases
Yeah, let's go, look at the skolia
This is a skolia of Nicander
Do you think for a minute
That there is a single evangelical out there
Who knows any of this?
And this is the stuff that's going on around Jesus
This is the language that he's growing up with
This is the language that he's speaking
Oh, God, love it, love it
Where's that Nicander?
We pulled him up, Nicander
Who is Nicander?
I'm going to introduce you to a priest
Priest of Apollo
In a minute, Nicander's going to give us
You know, because he knows all the drugs
We're searching for her
We're looking for her
Can we find her in this passage?
Oh, well, you know, it ends up being about Dionysus
Oh, guess what?
We get to join Dionysus
Why? Because Nicander
Thank you, Nicander, priest man
