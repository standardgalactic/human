Wrote, now, people
Are these biblical times?
Are these biblical times?
No, this is history
This is an actuality
Biblical times are made up fairy tale
This is reality
This is Nicander
And what is Nicander saying here?
He wrote a book called the Ophiaca, right?
A book on serpents
Just on the venoms of the serpents
Can you imagine having that much knowledge?
You knew every friggin' snake and what it did
And what does he say here?
He says everybody knows that Dionysus
Was made insane by Hera
Whoo!
And there's a snake involved
Where's that serpent?
Yeah, you can go to the next one
Where's that serpent or whatever?
By the way, Chewie's packed this thing tonight
With a lot of symbols and a lot of stuff
That's gonna take you
If you have time, a little extra to look it up
And see what it is and what it means
It's all part of the cultiness, right?
Thank you, Chewie
Brilliant job done by Chewie
Where is that snake?
Where is that snake?
I want to see the snake
Oh, Hera drove him mad
Oh, there he is again
Jesus!
Wait, leave him in there
Now you brought him
Now you summoned him, Chewie
Blow him up so I can really look him right in the eyes
That snake handling
You wait until we get to the end of the day
We're gonna show you Jesus
With his, what does he command all Christians to do?
What does he command all the junky commands him to get high?
Jesus tells him, get high
I didn't know that was in the Bible
I'm gonna show it to you
I love it
Can you feel me there?
Can you feel me?
Sometimes you can feel just a little shiver
Yes, it's a side effect
Go, hit me the next one
The incubus flies
Did somebody turn the incubus on?
Get that thing out of here
Okay, what is this?
I want us to know this
Now this central figure of the mystery
That we're about to meet
She was from the great house of E.T.'s
The son of Helios
Oh, isn't that something?
Isn't that something?
And she was taught
You want to know what her pedigree is?
This is what this says
She was taught
Remember, she ends up being the Queen of Babylon, too
She was taught
By Hecate
She was taught by Hecate
Oh, who is that Hecate?
She was taught drugs
All of them, not just some of them
All of them
Oh, God
And look at that bottom line
What is she able to do with all of her knowledge?
What is she able to do with those drugs?
What is it when you take a woman
And give her a chance to go all the way to the top
To be the master of nature?
What happens?
She pulls down the stars
She redirects the moon
That's what happens
That's what happens
Where was Athena?
Athena wanted me to pop
I'm obliged by the power of Athena
She who guides and directs our democracy
I'm obliged when she shows up
To do what she tells me
And I'm doing so tonight
Under the order of she who established democracy
Right, she's got all the skills
She's got all the skills
Came right out of his head
Boom! Right out of God's head
Boom!
Yeah, shaking her spear
Love it
Give me the two at the end
We need those two quotes at the end
These are from Athena
Right, people are like
Don't do that
That gets my goat when people do that
And they say, you can't talk about modern stuff
Where's...
Yeah, no, my goat
No, no, we're off course
Quick, readjust the sensors
We're messed up
Oh, my God
Did we fly close to...
No, the last two quotes
Remember that I said
I'll know when to put them in
Yes, there you go, fantastic
Here we are
You and experts demand investigation
And it claims Israeli forces
Killed, raped and sexually assaulted
Palestinian women and girls
Give me another one
Give me the second one
She said, do them both
Ukraine, rape and torture by Russian forces
Continuing, writes experts report
Take that down
When you support
The rape of children
While holding up the banner
Of defending life
Your hands are stained with blood
Your hands are stained with blood
So says Nemesis
So says Nemesis
We cannot
We cannot join those forces
That cause people to rape children
Those armies
Those armies do not fight for democracy
No, they don't
They don't, justice to them all
Justice to them all
This is the lesson of Algeria in history
This was her lesson, she had a song
We ignored it, we buried the books
Ah, what a mistake
Why did they bury the books?
It was about the time of the uprisings
And they buried the books
Because they thought the people would revolt
If they heard what she said
She said, defend
Defend those children
Their voice is the voice of democracy
Thank you, Athena
For that immortal lesson from antiquity
Thank you, we bring
The past and the future into the present
Love it, love it
Okay, back to the cult
Everybody get back to the cult
They're like, why did it get so serious all of a sudden?
I was just having a good time
Okay, get back on your throne
Get back on your throne, it's okay
It's okay, do you feel a little bit culpable?
Let's go, let's go to the next source
We're looking for the Palma Medes
That's what we're looking for
