We're still broadcasting, right?
We still have coverage
We're still, right?
The shields are still out, people
Let's keep going
Hit us with the next one
Yeah, there we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
There we go
Next one, yeah
There we go
And what does this stuff do to you, people?
Down below
If you look at what her communion does
It opens up your eyes
Wait, what?
Yeah
It gives you vision
It gives you vision
Because your eyes
Your eyes ain't open
They're blurred
You have embliopia
Your eyes
Are not open
Have you come here tonight
And you're like, what is this?
And you want your eyes opened
You got to go see the serpent
You got to go see the serpent
It turns out Yahoo's a big liar
Yeah, he made a debacle of the whole deal
Right, he took a Bronze Age thing
And just screwed it up
That's what happens when you're outsourced, baby
Let's go mainstream
Right through the Saturnian
Right into the Satanic
And bring it up
Open your eyes, people
What do you think this medicine does?
It opens your eyes
Hit us with the oh
And by the way, it's also good
For that craziness
This stuff makes you crazy, right?
Don't get me wrong
We've seen that before
But look what it does
It also cures rabies
You mean you can bring somebody
Through rabies on this stuff?
Yeah
That's how the physicians are using it
Oh, you didn't think of that one, did you, Doc?
No, you didn't
Good, and by the way
Look at that last word there
Antidotoy
It is the antidote, baby
And it smells like wonderland
It smells like wonderland
You have an antidote
It smells like wonderland
That's odd
Remember, we're fumigating people
We're fumigating
Didn't you?
You forgot when you came here
We had the fumigation going
You're breathing that stuff in
You're starting to purge now
The reality has hit you
Now you're getting a little bit of paranoia
A little bit of paranoia
It's starting to come up
I think it's going to get worse
You can use this as a treatment
For rabies
And the mania that comes from rabies
I love it
Let's go to the next one
Probably some chemicals in the brain stuff
You can even calm a titanic seizure
Yeah, a titanic fit
Tetanus, right?
They had to deal with it
And this is one of the medicines they used
I told you we were going to Lady Medicine, right?
I showed you the purple that she uses
That cures growths
This is it
This is it
Let's keep going
One more
Boom, boom
When are we all going to do this?
Says the physician
They do it
In the dawn
Yeah, you do it in the dawn
What time do you think it was?
What time do you think it was?
It was during the dawn, right?
We were dawn bringers
Let's go down
You didn't think we made up that stuff
About dawn bringers for nothing, did you?
Don't ever meet a
You'll never meet a resurrected vampire
Who's not a dawn bringer
A dawn bringer, right?
Jesus Christ himself
Right, you Christians, wake up, man
He's a dawn bringer
You mean he's using this stuff?
Where is he?
Bring up Jesus with his snakes again
Jesus
Yoo-hoo
Jesus, maybe if I do this kind of stuff
Come on
You'd like it
Where is he?
Chewie
Chewie
Oh, thank you
Fantastic
Remember, I told you
He's right in the middle of this stuff
And you've never seen this Jesus
I mean, we've been sniffing around him, right?
But you hadn't seen him before that
You hadn't seen that reality
Your vision has opened up
The blurriness that's in your eyes
Has been rubbed away
Those scales
You're healed
How are you healed?
You're healed with reality
Knowing yourself is a healing process
Right?
Who are we?
Who are we?
And that's why sometimes you've got to look in the mirror
And say, am I culpable?
When I see that armies overseas
Are raping children
Am I somehow culpable?
If I not stood against armies of rapists
Look, baby, this is Rome
This is Rome
This is exactly why Judea
And all of Greece were pacified
Yeah, they were volunteering by the end of
They were volunteering kingdoms to Rome
Because Romans don't put up with the lace-dace, man
Romans don't put up with the child traffickers
Those who do things to children
That's why they started arresting Christians
Because the Christians were performing ritual incestuous acts
A.k.a. adult women were sodomizing boys
Interesting, interesting
That's a strange thing to do
Yeah, there's a lot of chemistry involved
And there's a lot of anthropology
So let's hang up
Was that creepy, Jesus?
