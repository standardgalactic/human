I hope this is the true Tim
Because I've been waiting for the true Tim
He came and then he left and people were prophesying
Someday the true Tim shall return
He's the one I hear
He's the one always happy to talk for real
That's right
Satanic congregation we don't talk for fake
We want the real

We all wanted to see Jesus get arrested
With a naked boy
Isn't that amazing

Okay people
In all honesty I want to say
It's nice to be able to
Read your chat comments afterwards
And I take those into serious consideration
When there's serious stuff
There you know a lot of times it's just fun
But enjoy it
Love it and I love that stuff
It's gorgeous
I wanted you to really see
Tonight those concrete texts
So that you can have
An understanding
So that you can see
The Jesus Christ who is walking
In antiquity and you can bring him
Forward and you can
See the Jesus Christ
Who is out there now
And you know
Unless we're gonna really
Piss off the queen
Of democracy
That Athena
I think we should start paying attention
To the blood
Yeah let's protect those
Vestals those things
That are
In a place that they can grow
And blossom
Let's protect those things in life
That's the side that we should be on
Right otherwise you know
The watchers can only take so much
They can only take so much
The nemesis kicks everybody out
Thank you for coming tonight
I hope
That you have begun
To see
With the eyes
That the great physician
Can give us
Hail Satan
Sexy time witches
Ones with poisonous kisses
Ones with poisonous kisses
Cause I wreak like in the cup
Cause I wreak like in the cup
With the glowing chalice
Of dragon bender
Singing songs written on seashells
Fleece, tree sap and mushrooms
Coming through
Hail the sexy time witches
Hail the sexy time witches
Ones with poisonous kisses
Ones with poisonous kisses
Hail the sexy time witches
Ones with poisonous kisses
Ones with poisonous kisses
