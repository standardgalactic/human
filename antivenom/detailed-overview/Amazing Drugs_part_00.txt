Where are you schooled up?
I'm in the water, it's probably not what you think
Fresh up in the municipality, treatment set into the sink
Are the masters drug, could it be Satan?
If you want that christening, it's gonna come through the blood on the floor
If you're nurturing that logos, I'm with the company
I found the discarded appetite of your baggers
Fresh floors, licking acid in your water
As I stated back up in the business
Teddy babes, the cowdees
For my lady Medea, the queen of Babylon
Something in the drink, and the Greek picnic
Something in the drink
Something in the drink, and the Greek picnic
Something in the drink
Just some lunatic broadcasting from his kitchen
We know that
You guys who are working on the transcripts
Everybody who is involved in the process that the museum is going through
Thank you for your dedication and your hard work
For which you will never be paid a dime
Thank you, thank you very much
It's sacred duty, and we all know it is
So everybody who is involved in the process of bringing these sources
To your brothers and sisters
Thank you very much, thank you
The museum is coming back
Tonight I want to start with something
Just a little light to add just in
By the way, thanks Teddy
Thanks for the tunes, love it
Let's go right in, right in tonight to a little bitty
This is like an appetizer, right?
It's an appetizer
Just wait, just wait, the time machine is working
And when it gets there we'll be ready for the main event
But for now I want to start with something
That I remember telling you
Do you guys remember? Do you guys remember?
They are going to find
One of these types of psychosis inducing drugs
That's being used in antiquity
The archeologists are getting too good
Just wait for it, wait for it, it's coming
Well it came, it came, thank you
Thank you, it's February
Where are we? Chewy
Where are the star charts?
Give us that first one, yep
Oh god, and tonight you're going to have to blow them all up
Oh god, archeologists find evidence of hallucinogenic drug
In ancient Rome, fantastic, fantastic
Congratulations to Elaine
Nice job Elaine, writing this thing up, beautiful
Hit the next one Chewy
What's going to happen here?
What are the archeologists going to tell us?
Oh this is so exciting, this is so exciting
Boom, the scholars make the discoveries
It's a site in the Netherlands
It was inhabited from the 6th century BC
You can forget to eat, none of us care
Through the century seat, what is that?
That's anodomini babies, you know how we do it
We don't use their lingo, they don't like that
But I don't care, when it was under Roman rule
The findings comprise a 90 to 110 anodomini basket
Or fish trap buried face down with the plant
And a polished and hollowed sheep or goat femur
Containing around 1000 black henbane seeds
Hey somebody, somebody stop that guy
He can't do that here right outside the concert
What's he doing with all of those drugs?
This is the jackpot people, this is exactly the drug
That I told you we would see come
To life, the hands of the archeologists
Look at that, that was 100% accuracy
You got to give me that one, oh love it
Now wait, there's a lot more that you and I know
About the drugs, and guess what's going to happen
Yeah, go back to that quote for a second there Chewie
I don't mean to step on your toes here, go ahead
Boom, yes, what can you tell us?
Well there's 1000 black henbane seeds, right?
And it's in this thing, it's in a little carrying case
Isn't that nice, an ancient drug carrying case
Hollowed out femur, that's pretty cool
I wouldn't mind having some bit of antiquity like that
Ooh, can you smell that, can you smell that?
They hate that, they hate that overseas
They hate that on the island
They do, ooh, they're too sophisticated for that
Their scholars wouldn't look into it, so they missed the boat
But we're going to get fortunate and find it
Oh god, I love this stuff, look what else did they say?
What's the next one, she said something else
What's the genius here, there's a professor here
Who is this Dr. Goot, Dr. Goot, Dr. Goot
Nice job, here's what I particularly like about this find
Is the potential link between medicinal knowledge
Described by Roman authors in Roman Italy
And people are actually using the plant
In a small village on the edge of the empire
Right, oh isn't that nice
Noting that although she cannot rule out its consumption
In the Roman period, it is tempting to classify the drug
As a Roman introduction, no, no, no, no
Stop, stop, no, that's not what's going to happen
Now, see it was good Dr. Goot that you found it
That you found it right now
Just wait, just wait, it's coming
Let's show Dr. Goot the drug
Let's bring up the next one please, yeah
Oh, well here, no, this is the one, go there
