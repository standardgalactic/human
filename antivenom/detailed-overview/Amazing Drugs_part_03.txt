Neil, I need 10 minutes
Give me 10 minutes and I'll be there
Get a burrito
Love it
Go to the next source
Look, I'm going to flash through these
I'm going to flash through these
This is Mordyascortes
And here he's talking about the purple
And I just wanted to point out
That it's also talking about treating
And healing
What are considered growths
You can debate about what kind of growths those were
And what they could see
On the surface of the skin and whatnot
But okay, okay
The stuff kills growths
This is the purple
It's here, people
It's a drug
It's an actual drug
John Stuart
Educate yourself, buddy
It's a drug
Fantastic
Go to the next one
Look here at the bottom
I just want you to see here at the bottom
See the pomata
You can also drink the purple
You can drink the purple
If you're little fingers
If you're a 12-year-old girl
Named Mary, mother of God
And your little purple fingers are staying
From the purple that you work with
This is the kind of formulaic knowledge
That you have to have
To be able to stay alive
And by the way
They're going to auction you off
Wait, is this Greek?
No
That part of it is not
They're going to auction her off
To whoever's got the right lot
They're basically going to throw her out there
Why?
Because this is what they do in the temple
It's merchandising
Isn't it funny?
Merchandising creeps into the mystery
And at Jerusalem
It becomes about the sale of the virgin
Wow
Can you believe that?
Do you know what happens
When the mystery is profaned in that way
With cash, with property
With gain of goods and history
Justification for what you do to people
Do you know what that does?
The mystery implodes
To cleanse itself, the mystery implodes
Oh, God
I love that
I love that
Out goes that flame
Can you restart it?
Can you restart it supposedly?
Let's go to the next one
Boom
Finally, I wanted to give you a little bit of this
It's just a little bit of theophrastis
But this is a shout out to everybody
Who's wrapped up in the worship of Sebasius
Those of you out there
And how am I going to
Classify you people
Who follow Sebasius
You have this daisy daimonia
You have this respect
For the daimonis
The powers that be in nature
Do you have respect
For the powers that be?
Ask yourself that
The stuff that you can't see
That makes this universe tick
Do you have respect for that stuff?
I do
I do
And that makes me
A follower of Sebasius
You mean they had a monotheistic thing going on?
So that when people tell you out there
Hey, Judaism was the only monotheistic
No, it wasn't
I just heard somebody say that recently
Somebody from Jerusalem say that
There could be nothing further from the historical truth
Than that
Yeah, love it
Love it
Do you see what we're doing?
We're taking back those texts
We're the museum
It's the text
They can't take the text from us
Love it
Oh, bring up Hermaphrodite
Well, first show us Hermes
Chewie
Bring in Hermes
Everybody
Meet Hermes, please
When Odysseus met him
This is how he met him
He was a little boy
And he came up to Odysseus
And he said, oh, sir
You're gonna need some drugs
And he was like, what's that, drug boy?
And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take these drugs
And he was like, what's that thing you're carrying?
He's like, oh, that's a stick with snakes on it
Oh, God, I love it
And so
Up comes Moses
Right, up comes Moses
There's Hermes
What happens when you take Hermes
And Aphrodite
Aphrodite, show yourself, please
Let's look at Aphrodite
Thanks to the AI
By the way, the AI can make movies and video games now
Isn't that fantastic?
Oh, God
This is gorgeous
Who wouldn't want to live in 2024?
It's crazy, man
Bring us up Aphrodite
The, yeah
No, you can't
Did we leave Aphrodite somewhere?
Oh, she's in the videos
We put her in the videos
Anywho, when you take Hermes and Aphrodite
Then you get Hermaphroditis
Hermaphroditis, welcome
Welcome, yes, right
Okay, okay
Does anybody have a problem with Hermaphroditis?
I don't
I don't
You know who his best friend is, right?
Eros
Eros
Oh, love it
They're always together, man
They're always together
You know what they do?
They drink
And they play drinking games all the time
You mean
You mean
The founders of democracy
Thought it was okay
For two underage boys
To be getting drunk together
Playful
Yeah, no, that was
That was, you know, it was okay
It's mental health, people
Right, what's in those drinks that they're drinking?
Oh, God, love it
Next one down
Next one down
We gotta go to the next
We gotta fly here
Oh, I'm so behind
Okay, I'm just gonna jump
Look, it's the dip sauce
Here's the snake venom we were talking about
You're welcome to see it later
Go to the next one, Chewie
Go to the next one
I'm just letting people see
Because people inevitably ask me
Or they make snide comments
You know, on the channel here
And they say
Where is your sources?
Right here
Here they are
Can you even read them?
You can't even read them
Go to the next one
Love it
Love it
I'll take that little stand here
With a samurai
I'll cut you in half
We're gonna end with a passage
Of Jesus
I told you we were being Jesus
I hope Neo's paying attention
Because this is Jesus
With a naked grown man
Who is drugged out of his mind
And he's homeless
Right?
Let's see what happens
And so they're coming
Jesus is coming off the boat
And right away this dude
Runs up to him
Right from the tombs
And he's a man who is
Look at the last three words
In Pneumatic
Acathartoi
He is a man who is in
A spirit that is acathartic
What is that acathartic?
That is the unclean
Wait, what?
Well, that's how we translate it
That's not really what the Greeks said
Right?
They said that was the
Before the medical purge
Right?
If you want to get those demons
Out of your head
You're gonna have to be purged
And we're not gonna go
The direction that you think
We're not going to a party
Right?
We're gonna go somewhere
Where I gotta tie you down
I gotta tie you down
And drug you
And I'm gonna pump some stuff
Into you
In ways that you may
Or may not enjoy
But you're not gonna have a choice
And then you're gonna see me transform
And I'm gonna send you to hell
I'm gonna send you to hell
And I'm gonna bring you back
And when you come back
As soon as you come out of that water
And suck that air
You're gonna be as thankful as anybody
You're gonna have seen the shit
And now you're gonna know what's beyond
That's what I can promise you
Who's first?
Who's first?
You ready for the purge?
Are you ready?
Is this the stuff that we should be afraid of?
Remember, the Christians are doing this
Yeah, it's the magic, baby
It's the magic
And we can trace it with those drugs
They just found a whole dump of this stuff
Some lunatic was carrying around it
A container of it
Beautiful container of it
Oh, God, you know what those seeds do?
They don't call it mania for no reason
The Romans don't walk around saying
Hey, watch out for that insanity
They don't do that just for kicks
Sometimes it's necessary to go there
Welcome, let's go last
I think it's the last boom
Oh, here's Jesus
Anyway, hit the next
Here's Jesus and he says
Look, this guy had his home in the cemetery
And nobody was able to chain him up
Nobody was able to
Why? Because every time they did
Every time they did, he'd break out
They even put hand braces on him
And shackles on his feet
And he still was able to get free
This guy can't be treated, brah
He's outside and he's naked
He's naked, I promise you he's naked
Go to the next one
Jesus is like, hey, you know what I mean?
Day and night, this guy has been in the tombs
Oh, by the way, what's he doing?
What's this naked, full grown man
Doing and living in a cemetery
What's he fine to do that's fun
If he had some kind of page on some dating service
What would he put, things he likes to do?
Let's see, what's this man?
He goes around the tombs and around the hills
And the tops of the mountains
He runs around the mountains doing crazy stuff
What kind of crazy stuff does he do?
Oh, he vocalizes
He vocalizes, yeah, well, you know, it's the way
Have you ever heard of crow?
Yeah, you ever hear of frog?
Frogs do that kind of funny vocalization, right?
Sometimes it's a scream
