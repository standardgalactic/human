Aryans
I don't care
This is what we're getting at
The same thing
Right
And I'm so glad you're doing it
Because there's so many classical sources
They just throw them in
Just a mention of them
Oh, yeah
Thessaly, it's originally Pulaskian
They just throw that stuff in
And you're like
Who are these Pulaskians
And classicists have traditionally
Ignored them
Ignored them
But not only that
They say it's mythological people
But hold on a second though
They're only brought up
Well, I guess Homer writes about them
In Iliad and stuff like that
But whatever
You could say that's mythological
And even Homer's not talking about them
In a mythological sense
He's talking about them
He literally throws them into tribes
Like it's Homer will name six tribes
All five of those tribes are real tribes
And then Pulaskians are next to them
Wait, you're telling me that only this one tribe
Didn't exist
But these five do
Herodotus mentions the Pulaskians a hundred times
Probably not a hundred times
I'm just exaggerating
He mentions them all throughout his texts
He never says these are mythological people
They're talking about the Pulaskians
That's not how they're being described
In the ancient sources
So we're just interpreting it our own way
Saying we can't find anything
We can't find any people that call themselves
Pulaskians in any text
That's because these people existed before writing
So whether we call them
This is what I'm saying in my video
Whether we call them proto-Indo-Europeans
Which we made up
Nobody called themselves that
So what's the difference between that and Pulaskian?
You know what I mean?
I guess Aryans is like a real
People did call themselves Aryans
People call themselves Meads too
But obviously getting as I'm saying
These people all came from this black sea region
In between the black and Caspian sea
The steppe area
Or it all begins
By the way, right there is where the cultivation of the vine
Is discovered
Where wine is discovered
So this is Dionysian to its core
This is why you find all these Dionysians
And there's so many gods
Like Dionysus
That are like the Scythians
Have so many different tribes
This is like getting really micro into this
And they all have these different names for these gods
But their functions
You can see them
Oh, that's Zeus
Papaios
Papaios, that's Zeus
Oh, he's a skyfather
Oh, there's another god
Goddess
Earth goddess
Oh, that's like Gaia
And you can see there's a connection going on
And then you see this god
He's the vine bearer
And he's like
The moisture gives growth to the crops
He's the vegetation dying and rising god
The son of the skyfather
There's just so much lining up
In all these different cultures
And you know, Carl Jung
Gives it the word archetype, vine
I guess that's cool
But I'm just saying
Even if it's just an...
He's trying to get it
It's all like in the...
These are archetypes that come from our minds
But I'm saying
It's even simpler than that
These people all descended from a common ancestry
By the way, this is mind blowing too
Drugs, ancient drugs
Is at the center of all this stuff
Because the words for holy
The words for god
When you find out that they're...
That if you look at the Indians
The Sanskrit
You compare it to the Germanic
And you compare it to the Avestan stuff
That's in Persia
And then you find that these words
Are a little bit tweaked
Haoma
Soma
Gotta
Which means...
Which is the word for god
The word god comes from the word drug
Soma
So you're talking about being...
The word god itself
Has a connection to the ancient drugs
To the Soma
Yeah, in that little bit
That I just showed from diascortes
They call it, right?
They're calling it the Dionysius
The deathy ram, right?
They're using his title and saying
The drug is him
This equation
That's why the Greeks come up with the concept
Of entheosis, right?
To have the god inside of you
How do you get the god inside of you?
Right?
Through the plant
That's how...
That's the avenue
That's the avenue
By the way, everybody...
The rootcutters are the priestesses
Why are they called rootcutters?
All the priestesses we call the rootcutter
What is she doing with root...
Because they're making...
Because what do you think...
I mean, DMT
What do you think the number one
Way to get DMT is
From roots
Did you know that?
I bet you a lot of SPL scholars
Don't know that
DMT, the hot...
Is it toad?
That's the hot...
And they're very rare
You're not going to buy the toad in the mail
You have to go and find one somewhere
Which is very...
Logistic-wise
It doesn't make sense
But these roots are everywhere
Acacia trees
Mimosa trees
The roots
You cut the roots up
You blend it in some water
You soak out the juices
You mix it up
You do this whole process
I can tell you it
But I'm not going to do it here
There's a whole process
Where you can get
ayahuasca or DMT
From roots
So these root cutters
Were figuring this shit out
Way before we did
And this is at the center
Of religion itself
That's why I'm like...
When a religious scholar
Doesn't think this is crazy
Or you're out there, man
What the hell, man?
This is...
I don't...
This is crazy
No, you don't know
What you're talking about
This is at the center of it all
Because if you look at these ancient texts
Soma
Haoma
And Gota
Kaikyan
Kukyan
These are all these...
And this is every...
This is the center of the mystery
This is the initiation
This is the most important aspect
Of the religion
And then you have in Christianity
You have a Eucharist
You don't think there's a connection there?
I think you need to do some more reading
To be honest
Totally
I think you need to do some more reading
I'm going to quote you
And next time I get one of these biblical scholars
That the classes is laugh at
Because they're so bad
I'm going to say
You need to listen to Neal
From Gnostic Informant, man
And go there
You know what I mean?
Neal, I love it
And I love the fact
By the way
Don't...
I know you may have already
Included it in your video
But remember that
Medea in Seneca's Medea
Is using Pulaskean
And in her chance
And he even says that
In the text
Seneca says that in the text
Why would Seneca be so interested in that?
Because the
Caesars and their libraries
Were always interested
In the Pulaskean connection
With the Etruscans
And which we know
Linguistically is probably there
Because of what...
They said that their Trojan blood
Because Aeneas founded the city of Latium
The Trojans are part of that
Pulaskean
One of the Pulaskean tribes
Right
So they figured it out
And by the way
And they've invented this
I don't know how they knew this
But it turns out
The Italic people are
Closely connected to the people
From the Black Sea region
They had that same
I don't know how you...
Haplogroup, whatever
I don't know
It's the same language types
And the same genetic types
As people from that region
So they migrated west into Italy
At some point
At some point during that age maybe
Or even the end of the Stone Age
Yeah, the Tiersanoi baby
The Tiersanoi
And the connection
Remember Cersei?
She lives off the coast of Italy
They kicked her out
Because of what she was trying to do
Power-wise
So that connection
Between the Black Sea
These are priestesses
Of the Caesarines
Man, these are priestesses
Of that area now
That they're fighting over
They're trying to take back
From Russia, right?
We were talking
We were talking about Medea
Being from the eastern coast
Of the Black Sea
And Colchis, right?
Yeah
And the Medes
Who have become the most powerful
Dynasty in the world
The Persian Empire
That's a Mede empire
They're found by people
Who are Medeans, Medes
And the Medes
It says in Herodotus and in Diodorus
The Medes formerly
Were called Aryans
And they changed their name
To be of Medea
Yeah
Medes means Medea
Like they're related to Medea
Right
They're the sons of Medea
Right
And by the way
In Pontus
