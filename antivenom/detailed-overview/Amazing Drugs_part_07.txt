This rich
Rich country pops up
In the 3rd, 2nd century BCE
This kingdom of Pontus
And it's
The capital
And you have
Mithridates, the 6th
The Poison King
And you know what he says?
By the way
There's a story about his birth
Where three magi come and visit him
And there's a star
It's really, really eerily similar
To Christianity's birth scene
But guess what it also says?
That he's descended
From both Alexander the Great
And Cyrus the Great
Making him the fucking king
Of the world
Like this is like
But everybody was obsessed with genetics back then
Everybody
Caesar has Venus's blood
And this person is related to this person
Well this is like
No way
You have a king
Who's born from Alexander the Great
And Cyrus the Great
He's the greatest of all time
So he rises up
Becomes a fucking
They said that
All the wealth he had
If you convert it into dollars
It'd be like
Past the trillions
It'd be like uncountable
How much wealth he had
He also had
He also had the
Theriac that was meant
To balance the communion
From the dark harbor
And writes about it, right?
We have the
We have Roman
Here's a Roman physician
Who wrote about it
And he said by the way
The real thing that you need to do
With the toxicon
Is you need to take the
Mithridatic remedy
He said that will balance it
And I thought, wow
Look at that
I mean the tech there
Is fantastic, right?
You're developing
Bronze age stuff
Funnily through all that
Scientific advancement
Of Hellenism
And boom, right?
And people think
Well the Black Sea
That's Hellenism
Yeah it is, right?
Who do you think they're
Worshiping?
Worshiping Diana, right?
Even the Lacedace
They're worshiping Diana
So, oh my God
I love it
So when is this video
Going to come out?
I would say probably
By the end of next week
Okay, okay
Look at how much work that is
Can you just say something about that?
How much work do you put into
One of these videos?
All day
This is what I do
All day long
When you add up
Your script writing
One time I leave the house
To go to the gym sometimes
Every other day maybe
You know, not every day
Every other day
Go to the gym
So I don't get like
Cause I was
When I first started doing YouTube
Full time
I was working at a factory
And I left the factory
And I was in pretty decent shape
Back then
From standing up all day
And moving tires around
And then I started sitting around
Editing videos all day
And never leaving the house
And then I gained a bunch of weight
So now I'm like figuring out
Okay, now I gotta do something
I gotta get out of the house
And work out
And touch grass a little bit
Which I've been doing
Which I have to, you know
And I spend
You mean
Neal is transforming
Into Hercules
As we sit here and watch
He is becoming Hercules
And I know
I know that he knows
That's a lot deeper
Than just making jokes
Right, and he has a lot more
Respect for that
But I'm fully expecting Neal
Someday for
Look, if when
Like I said
When the stuff happens
I need you in the boat
Right, we need to work together
Because I'm gonna need you
As Hercules
And I think it's fantastic
I think it's fantastic that
You're not only building
That muscle
But with your scholarship
Raw, you're killing people
Right, you're killing
We're slaying
I know you don't want
I know you don't want me to say it
My amateur scholarship is poison arrows
Yeah, exactly
Hercules and exactly
Right, and I know you don't
Want me to say it
But you just mounted
Dan McClellan's backside
On your wall
You did
You took him
You took him down
He's got nothing
He can't stand it
He doesn't
I'll bet you
I'm willing to bet
He doesn't even know
How to track your sources
I'll bet he wouldn't
Even understand
How to prove you wrong
Or right
And the funny thing is
If you bothered
To get into those sources
To try to prove you wrong
You would see
Exactly what you're saying
Because your video
Was just you
Presenting sources
I love it
I love it, baby
Last thing I want to say
Before we go on to my thing
Do you really think it's
A coincidence that the
Dionysian epiphany
Was celebrated on the same day
As the Christian epiphany
Which is the same day
As the Dushour's epiphany
Which is the same day
As the Ion epiphany
All of them are celebrate
On January 6th
What?
No way, dude
You're crazy
The people who thinks
It's just a coincidence
What are you talking about?
That's a miracle
There's no way
There's something culturally happening
Within Christianity
As well as all these other cults
In the Eastern realms
Of the Roman Empire
And they're connected
And Christian scholars
Don't want to admit this
They want to think Christianity
Is like this offshoot of Judaism
Perfectly pure
And even though it presents itself
As anti-Pagan
Of course
Sort of the Platonist
A lot of people
A lot of people pretend to be anti-Pagan
But still bower from Pagans
This is like a normal thing
At that time period
Alright
Alright, Neil
Hit it
You were going to present something
I'm going to
I'm going to disappear
For a few minutes
Everybody, here is Neil
Alright
So I've got a screen on the bottom
That I want to present
So the word adopt
Adamus
It means indestructible
Right?
Now, Parmenides uses this word
To describe the four elements
In his on nature
Which is interesting
Because he talks about God
Creating the cosmos
Using four elements
And you almost
It's almost
Right off the bat
My spite, he said
Is just tingling
Because I'm looking at the Genesis
And God creating Adam
And taking his rib off
And creating Iwa
Right?
So I'm like
Okay, that's just a hypothesis
At this time
So I just put that aside
For a little bit
By the way
Adamus
Or Adam
Is very
Closely looked
Very closely related to
Hadis
Or Hades
Spelled with the aspirated A
A-D-E-S
So you're looking at two names
Starting with A-D
Whenever you see something like that
You should kind of go
Well, let's look into this
You got
Ad-Adis
And the Kori
Who's called Iwa
This is a thing
Persephone's two titles
Well, she has a lot of titles
One of them is Iwa
And she gets stuck in Hadis
For eating the pomegranate
Almost in a mirror image
Sense analogous to
Eve getting cast out of
Paradise for eating fruit
By the way
The consensus right now
Is that it wasn't an apple
It was a pomegranate
Most people think that's what it was
It's hard to prove this
But most scholars think this was a pomegranate
That Eve aids
Anyways
I have it
Put that source back up
If you don't mind
So the next thing I want to show is
Whoops
Sorry about that
Alright
Let me
I clicked on
Instead of
I clicked on my screen
To share
Alright
So I got that screen back up now
Alright
Sorry about that
Alright now
The next thing I want to go to is Play-Doh
