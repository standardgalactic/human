Alright
Play-Doh talks about this
And is Tamaeus
You can tell it's very
Parminidian
He's very
He's very well
Being
Influenced by Parmini
Or Empedocles
I'm sorry
Empedocles
Or both of them
The both of them talk about the
Elements
Right
Empedocles is first, actually, I think
Anyway, it doesn't matter
Play-Doh is writing about these elements
See, you could see the top, the four kinds
And he's talking about the demi-urge
Creating the universe
We call it the cosmos
Right
So
I'm not going to read all this
This is a lot
But I just want to highlight some things that he talks about
When he's talking about the demi-urge
Creating the cosmos
With four elements
So
He says it right here
He says
Well, you just saw the four kinds
Talks about fire, earth, water, and air
Solid bodies
And form a body
Huh
That's interesting
Form a body
By the way
He also talks about
In this same text
I don't have it in front of me
You can look this up for yourself
That check me, please do that
Always check what I'm saying
In this same exact text
I don't know if it's before this or after
But at some point he talks about
The different races of humans
That are made from these elements
There's the golden race
The silver race
The bronze race
And so forth
And
It makes you think like
Because
Well
I'm already trying to compare it to Genesis
And thinking like
You have this indestructible atom
Who lives for like
Thousands of years
Or whatever
Thousands of years
Nine hundred years
Whatever
And
He's the first atom
And Jesus is the last second atom
Right
So you have like a new creation thing going on
But let me put that aside
Let me put that for
Let me jump ahead on this real quick
I just want to show one more thing
So he talks about
He uses this word
To describe the elements
Adam
A dominant
Which means indestructible
He's talking about the
Indestructible
Mixture of these elements
He calls it an offshoot of gold
Which is very hard
Because of its density
And black in color
Is called a dominant
So he uses the same word
Which
You're all probably wondering
Why doesn't he just say
Adam
Why is there more letters
And you know
Greek is like that
But I think there's a better reason
For why they shorten this to Adam
And I'll get to that in a second
But he says
And the kind
Which closely resembles gold
In its particles
But has more forms than one
And the density
Is more dense than gold
And partakes of small
And fine portions of earth
So that it is harder
While it is also lighter
Owing its
Having large interstices
What is that
Interstices within it
This particular kind
Of the bright and solid waters
Being compounded thus
Is termed bronze
And this is the time
With the bronze race
This is talking
He's talking about mortals
Being created
Get it?
And the portion of earth
That is mixed
By the way
There is that earth
Remember everyone says
Adam means earth
See it now?
The portion of earth
That is mixed
Therewith
Becomes distinct by itself
And both grow old
And separate
Each
Again each
Form the other
And then it is named rust
That's like the lowest level
Rust
Alright
That's just
I'm just throwing hypotheses out there right now
Now I want to show you
Something from the sibling oracles
Because I've always said this
Sibling oracles reveals
A lot of these mysteries
They tell a lot of this stuff
Like when you want to look
We want to know the origins of Christianity
Read the sibling oracles
Because what you're getting
In the sibling oracles
Is you're getting people who are
Not, they don't care
They're not like team Judaism
Or team paganism
Or team this
Like these are people
Within mystery religions
That are doing it
Mixing all this stuff
Sort of like what you get
In the Greek magical papyri
But these are simply
These are Roman texts
Written for the priestly class
In the Romans
This is like high level
Secret stuff
Like not everybody had
Not everybody had access
To these texts
Now if you
I think it's f1 is search right
Whoops
I'm still here right
Okay good
Let me see
If I search for Adam
Check this out
There's a connection
With Hades with Adam
Right up the bat
It says
Which snatched the dreadful men
Away from life
And Hades then received them
It was called Hades
Since Adam
Having tasted death
Went first
And earth
Encompassed him around
And therefore
All men
Born upon the earth
Are in a boat of Hades
Called to go
Whoa okay
Let's keep going
What else did they say
About Adam
There's that word again
They use it to describe
The gates of Hades
So you got the
Instructible gates of Hades
They're using that same word
Indestructible
Right
Alright
Here's where things get wild
In my opinion
Because often in the sibling
Oracles
It's not just here
It's other places too
This is such a weird title
Can you guys see the screen right now
Where I have it highlighted
Maybe I can zoom in a little bit
Let's see if I can do that
Yeah there we go
Let's do this
Okay
Is that better?
Okay that's better
This is the God
Who formed
Four lettered Adam
The first one formed
And filling with his name
East, west, south and north
The same as he
Who fixed the pattern of the human form
And made wild beasts
Now this is a really
Odd esoteric passage in my opinion
Four
What
Who do you know that's ever called
Four lettered anything
My name is Four lettered
Neal
Nobody calls me Four lettered Neal
What a weird title to give somebody
Four lettered
Well
What if
Adam being Four letters
Is something to do with the Four elements
The Four
And this is like
They're tetragrammaton
Like yahoo gets extended to Yahweh
Because you know the oldest
Fragments of Yahweh
It's three letters
All of a sudden it gets four letters
This is a weird thing going on
With numbers
I don't know what it is
I'm still researching this
It's still in my hypothesis zone right now
But I just want to throw this at you
The idea that he's called
Four lettered Adam
It's like why is he called Four lettered Adam
Why isn't it just Adam
Or why isn't it something else
Because it signifies
Something's going on there
There's a reason why he's Four letters
And I'm thinking
When we're looking at these other texts
That I showed you
With Adamus being the indestructible elements
That the Demiurge used to craft humans with
The Earth
And this is why I think Adam becomes
Also called Earth
Because there's a connection here
They're using the indestructible elements
Of the Earth
To create humans with
Adam being the first one
Alright
Now you're probably thinking
This is a little wild
Let me get some more evidence for this
Sure
I got one thing for you
This is going to be cool
Alright
I'm going to share my screen one more time
Let me see this
Okay
Once you see it
Pop it up on the screen
There we go
This is the Samothoration Mysteries
Now a lot of us know about this
Because we love mystery religions
So we're all thinking
Oh yeah, I love this
By the way
In the sources and in the archaeology
These are the oldest of all
