This is like Pulaskian stuff
By the way, Pulaskians are
We're inhabited that region
But they call themselves Pulaskians too
And they're identified with this island
This secret magical mystery religion island
Where these sacred priests who held the oldest
According to Diodorus
According to Strabo
According to Herodotus
According to basically anyone that writes about
Samothrations
They're the oldest priestly class of all
They're holding onto mysteries that are so old
They go back to like the stone age
Right
Well, let's look at this for a second
What do they got going on?
Well, it turns out that they have a primordial hero
Called Adamus
The spiritual person
Okay
The Nazian preacher
Identifies this Adamus
With Adam
And he also calls Jesus the second Adamus
So you already have a connection going on
With Adamus
By the way, this name means an indestructible hero
He's the indestructible hero
That's the primordial god
Like demigod of the mysteries
And so
Brief history of the mystery rights
The rights went back to pre-Greek Thracian-Palaskian
Inhabitants of the Samothrations
This is why the priests of the rights
Preserved in their liturgies
Pre-Greek Thracian words
This is why my video has so much on it
Thracians are the
I love the Thracians
I can't wait to tell you guys about the Thracians
They are the best
They are the best
I'm starting to almost like them more than the Greeks
I'm sorry
I know that's blasphemy to some of you
The Thracians are the fucking best
I'm sorry
I have to say it
And by the way, the Greeks would say that too
The Greeks love the Thracians
All the religion in Athens is all Thracians shit
Imported
Orpheus was a Thracian bard
You know what I'm saying? You get it?
Dionysus is all over Thracia anyways
So you have this religion where
That's pretty much it
Okay, that's it
Stop sharing
So you have a primordial demigod
Called Adamus
In the oldest mystery religion
It's way older than Judaism or Christianity
Before there's any thought on the radar
Because they're all polytheists in Judea at this time
They're not...
There's no Judaism yet
It's a way...
That's a...
Hellenistic thing
And maybe Persian thing
And the source is a Hellenistic thing
There's no synagogue till 200 BCE
Not one
So I'm just saying like
This is stuff that predates Genesis
And now
By the way
There's other words for man in Hebrew
It's not Adam
Adam is a secondary term
They don't say, hey, that Adam over there
Get him over here
There's another word that you...
I can't take it for right now
It is...
I think it's ish
I should know that
But I just forgot
You're right
Can you imagine, Neil?
Can you imagine now the person who stepped up
And who was having to compose the Torah
In Greek
They're making this text
And they're trying to establish their own tradition
It'll give them the legitimacy that they need
And what are they doing?
They're...
Look at what you've done with Adam
They're borrowing from the Greek tradition
And they're trying to claim it
They're trying to be able to say
Okay, it's appropriation
And of course they have to
Because they're buried in Alexandria
With the behemoth
That is the Greek tradition of history and drama
All sorts of lyric poetry
They're buried by that
So you can see that whoever wrote it
Was trying to justify or create a culture
Right?
So, yeah, we see that
I love the fact that what you're doing
Is you're looking at it from those texts
And where they are in history
It's brilliant
And you know, nobody...
I know that this is a war, baby
For this knowledge
And nobody can stand against you
When you just pull out those sources like that
I love it, man
I love it
Congratulations on doing such a great job
I do want to ask you about your presentation
I want to ask you
What was that I saw about
You flashed it off the screen real quick
You don't bring it back
But it was something about erections
With Adam
Something about Adam's erection
Do you think it's strange
That they would be focusing on it?
Isn't that just in the temples
To the muse
We've got a giant erect phallus there
That's part of the deal
Are you saying that these people had their own
Hermes
And do you think those statues of Hermes
With the erections on them
That we see all over the roads
They're like mile markers
You've got a Hermes there with a big erection
I thought they are
They're directionals for people
Because you don't have GPS
You're not walking down with a map in your hand
You know what I mean
So you walk around these roads
Follow the erections
Follow the phallus
Points to the way
Fantastic
Oh, I love it
I'm going to give you the last word
Priapis is called the good
The agathos
The good dimon
Agathos dimon
Love it
God, isn't that good
People, look what
Look what
I'm going to end it there
Because that was pure dessert
You can see that
But Neil, I do want to ask you
You went to the Met
And you saw the room
With all the Priapis stuff
Can you tell people one minute on that?
There's hundreds of thousands of these things
I'm not joking
There's hundreds of thousands of these
Priapis statues
That Greeks and Romans
And Egyptians and Syrians
All would put on their houses
Like garden gnomes
And these were
Because Priapis is a symbol
The phallus
And if you read about Priapis
In the Orphic hymns
He's the last
Of the generation from Thanes
So sometimes their names hyphenated
Thanes Priapis
They're all one line of gods
Going from Thanes all the way through
To Dionysus
And then Dionysus and Aphrodite
The two most sacred gods
And goddess of the mysteries
Dionysus and Aphrodite
Venus and Bacchus
That's Lucifer, baby
That's the morning star
They can't get a better union than that
And they birth Priapis
Priapis is the holy child
Of Venus and Bacchus
What? How come no one ever talks about Priapis?
Where is he in the discussion of gods?
I'm bringing him out more
Because this is a big deal
He's the child of Venus and Bacchus
Oh god, you thration bastard
What are you doing?
You're gonna ruin us all
I love that
Look at how deep you are into that stuff
You're not gonna be able to come out of it, man
I'm not the one where I am
I'm Slavic, so I kind of am
Look, it's your own ancestors calling you
You know what I mean?
Oh my god
Okay, Chewie made a video
That I want to show
It's the hymn to Apollo
Just a short one
And I want you to see
Because Neil ended there on Lucifer
Ended there on Iosferos
And this is the house of the dawn bringer
Phosphorus
And Phosphorus
And Phosphorus
Yes, yes, right
Light bringer
Good, hit us, Chewie
