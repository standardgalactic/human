He says, I found the Christian dogma
unintelligible early in life.
I absenteed myself from Christian assemblies,
Benjamin Franklin.
Thomas Jefferson writes a letter to William Short
where he says, I'm an Epicurean.
We already read this one.
He says, Epicurious containing everything rational and moral
and philosophy which Greece and Rome left us.
Epictetus indeed has given us what was good
of the Stoics all beyond of their doctrine
being hypocrisy and grimace.
Their great crime was their colonies
of Epicurious and misrepresentations of his doctrines
in which we lament to see the candid character
of Cicero engaging as an accomplice.
The merit of his philosophy is the beauties of his style.
Diffuse, rapid, rhetorical, but enchanting.
By the way, he shits on Plato here too.
Look what he says down here.
Of Socrates, we have nothing genuine
but at the memorial of Xenophon.
For Plato makes him one of his own collocators
merely to cover his own whimsies
under the mantle of his own name.
By the way, what does he mean by that?
He's saying Plato, the Socrates we get in Plato
is like this guy trying to push forms
that Plato and Socrates never actually taught.
So it's just Plato making Socrates his own character,
his own hero.
So he shits on Plato here, which is awesome.
And then he says the whole great deal
of sound and practical morality,
but the greatest of all the reformers
of the depraved religion of his own country
was Jesus of Nazareth.
So John Adams also in another letter in January,
I don't know if this is, I can't see the date,
but the whole history of these books
is so defective and doubtful
that it seems vain to attempt minute inquiry into it.
And such tricks have been played with their text
with the text of other books relating to them,
that we have a right from that cause
to entertain much doubt
what parts of them are genuine.
There's just so much evidence that they left behind
that they were not trying to create a Christian nation.
But what kind of nation do they want?
Well, let's continue.
He says, Christian philosophy,
the most sublime and benevolent,
but most perverted system that ever shown on man
endeavored to crush your well-earned
and well-deserved fame,
as he writes to Joseph Priestly in 1801.
Now, what are actual people
who profess Christianity believing?
You got Adolf Hitler, who says,
as a Christian, I have a duty to allow myself
to be cheated, but I have the duty
to be a fighter for truth and justice.
You know, the people who actually claim Christianity
is where you get people like Hitler and Mussolini.
You know what I mean?
No one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity,
Adolf Hitler.
Today, I believe that I am acting in accordance
with the will of the Almighty Creator,
Adolf Hitler.
I am now, as before, a Catholic,
and will always remain so.
So, all right, so now I want to show you something.
There is Minerva, you know, Libera.
And look, you got Priapis wearing the Phrygian cap
and all that. This is all good symbolism.
But the thing I want to show you guys now,
what kind of nature...
Whoa, did I click on that?
Was that...
Oh, hold on on that. That's the last one.
That's the banger at the end.
Hold on on that. Thank you for that, though.
I'm glad it's ready to go.
Before we get to that, what you just heard,
that sounded like a star-spangled banner, didn't it?
So let's...
What kind of...
What is the God of Liberty, right?
What is... What's going on here?
So let me... I'm going to share something, not that one,
but I'm going to go to a different thing.
It's called the Anachronistic Song.
Right?
And actually, you know, I'm sorry,
before I even get to this,
let me back up for a second.
Let me share something else first.
I have something interesting that I want to share.
These are the councils that we get
from the church back in the day.
These are old councils
where they...
We can actually go back as historians
and we can look
at what laws are being passed
by actual Christian nations.
Are they... Are they Liberty-loving Christians?
Are they...
Are they letting everyone just be who they are
as long as, you know, we have Christ
and everyone can be who they are.
We're going to accept everybody. Let's find out.
This is the council in Trulo
in this late 7th century.
And this is going to blow some of your minds
on what kind of laws they were passing
against the common folk.
You know, I hear people talk
about all the time that Christianity
is this religion that always
is looking down at the downtrodden
and allowing
for the help
to help all people.
But it does that...
It uses that as a mask
to do what it has to do,
which is create
more division
and to get more power.
So this is a...
We're looking at these ancient
texts that come down
from the 7th century.
And the 62nd canon sets forth
restrict prohibitions
against the worship of the abominable
Dionysus. Check this out, ready?
I'm going to blow right through this,
but I want to highlight a few things
that we found from this text
that is just amazing,
mind-blowing, has everything
to do with the opposite of liberty.
So
the 6th Acumenical Council
has resolved
a monothelic controversy
but failed to deal with the demoralization
of Byzantine society.
So what is going on here?
Why are they passing all these new canons?
Well, it turns out that under
Emperor Justinian
who stands ahead of the canons
mentions that some remainder
of pagan or
Jewish perversity
needs to be dealt with.
So this frequent references
in the proclamation to the devil
as the dragon
or the Assyrian, the man slaying
demon, the pagan gods
and particularly Dionysus,
who by the way is
Liber, Freedom.
We're identified as demons, right?
And it says
if we're just going to blow right through this,
I just want to show you some of these,
so highlight some of this amazing stuff
what we find here.
The survival of pagan cults
and practices among Christians
alarmed imperial and ecclesiastical
authorities. We're talking late in the 7th century now.
It seems partly because
the Empire still had a highly visible
but not very large
pagan population. By the way,
that warms my heart to hear this
that people in those days
even against, even after Theodosius
shut down all the temples
and closed down all the
libraries and basically
made it so there's only one religion now
and everyone else is a heretic.
People still held on
to their traditions. They had to go underground
and they had to go deep into
the mountains and the wilderness, as you're going to see right here.
He says very little
information survives in the sources about
the continuation of pagan cults.
That's because they're not in a lot, these pagans don't exist in libraries anymore.
They have no control
over text. It's all
the church now. But the pagans
do exist. They're just underground
and they're not in control of anything.
Which is why there's hardly any sources
about them. But it will be recalled
that in 542, John of
Ephesus, with the assistance of
Deuterius,
the metropolitan
of Keria,
by the way, that's an Asia Minor,
Keria, undertook, that's where the great
mother was worshiped by the way, undertook
the catechization of the pagans of western
Anatolia,
the regions of Asia, Keria,
Lydia, and Phrygia.
John himself penetrated the mountains
country near trails
and convinced many idol worshipers
to embrace Christianity. Convinced,
right? Remember that. Convinced.
Or more like forced.
