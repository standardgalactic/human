He directed these activities from a monastery
at Deerear,
at the time entered a rough mountain
area, where a celebrated pagan
temple containing
1500 idols
existed. I love it.
I wish I could find these people.
I wish I could go back in time and find these people.
It would be amazing. The conversion of these
populous regions was accomplished
by the foundation of more
than 100 churches
and monasteries.
They're just
repurposing old pagan temples.
The maintenance of these institutions
was necessary to prevent the
apostasy of the vast new congregation.
The population
of these regions evangelized by John
practiced the enthusiastic cult
of Kubli,
which featured orgiastic rituals
including self-castration.
The strength of paganism
in these areas, even after John's
missionary work, is attested
by the persistence of his cult
practice in Keria well
into the 8th century
as cosmos of Jerusalem states.
Following a description
of the cult of Kubli,
until the present day
certain irrational pagans in the mountains
of Keria castrate themselves
and is related, ruled by
this ancient custom.
Damn, all the way in the 8th century
they're still doing this.
By the way, they found, they find
temples of Kubli and Addis
all the way in Germany in the Rhine
and
they actually, we actually have
one of my coming up videos.
There's evidence of
the pine tree
ritual. The one that everyone says
only happened in the March
Aquinox Festival.
I found a text that says that
on December 9th
in December, they were doing
the pine tree ritual all the way
in like the 7th century.
So the whole idea that
there was no evidence of anyone doing anything
with pine trees in paganism in Germany
doesn't exist. That's false.
I'm going to show that in one of my coming up videos.
Not saying that's the,
I'm not even saying that where the
Christmas tree comes from. I'm just saying
the idea that there's no evidence
of pagans doing anything with
pine trees in Germany is just false.
And it's not even that it's not
false, it's in December too.
Anyways, let's go through this real quick.
I got a couple more things that I want to point out.
The 62nd canon
enumerates
several Greco-Roman cult festivals
and forbids their celebration.
The Brumalia, the Bota, the
Calens, and the 1st of March.
The Brumalia was the traditional
festival of Dionysus
and the Bota, that of Pan.
Celebrated at the Winter Solstice,
the Brumalia can have been
little more than a calendar custom by this time.
Remember, they don't have
the state behind them anymore.
They are underground, they are private pagans.
As the final stage of the wine
cycle, when the
fermented liquid was poured into jars,
this festival
had an obvious pagan significance
and its juxtaposition with Christmas
must have offended.
I love this.
We're talking about sources well
late in the 7th and 8th century.
They're still doing this whole
Christmas versus paganism thing.
Must have offended
the austere Justinian the 2nd.
How offensive you guys are
for practicing your own rituals.
The Brumalia had attained
respectability as a holiday
by the late 7th century
and persisted despite the
injunction of this canon.
They're not listening.
They don't care about your Christianity.
They're doing what was passed
down to them.
For example, it was celebrated at the
Imperial Court during the reign of Constantine V.
The survival of such cults including that of Pan,
the Peloponnese suggest the continuous
existence of an ethnically Hellenic
population in European Greece.
Check this out, ready?
This is where shit gets wild.
The 62nd canon
forbade the invocation
of the name
of the abominable Dionysus
when the grapes were crushed
in the wine vats.
Bidiculturists
were also cautioned to
avoid frivolous laughter.
You can't laugh.
Laughter is illegal
while pouring the fermented wine
into jars because that meant
cooperation with the god.
The ecclesiastical authorities
regarded such agrarian earth gods
as demons and eventually
feared the apostasy
of the wine producers.
Now, if you've been paying attention
to me and Amor on Lady Babylon
for the last few weeks,
we pointed out
that the Bacchic chant
Ya'o or Ye
it's either Ye,
Yo, or Ya'o
sometimes is Eva or Iwa.
Those are Bacchic chants
that wine
that people who produce wine,
people who cut the grapes
who are different
times of the year were these
agricultural pagan sites
that honored Dionysus
and the great mother and Demeter.
They would chant these Bacchic chants out
Ya'o, Ya'o, Ya'o
and they would get into this
frenzy
and they'd start laughing, really creating
this Bacchic frenzy
and they would chant Ya'o, Ya'o, Ya'o.
They're saying
in the 62nd canon
in the late 8th century
or 7th century
that they made this illegal.
No longer were people who produced wine
were allowed to chant
to Dionysus or
get into
frivolous laughter.
So, not only is the
freedom god, Liber,
illegal,
but chanting his name is illegal
and laughing is illegal.
This is the most anti-liberty
movement that has ever touched
the face of this planet, Christianity.
The 62nd canon
also forbade certain cult practices.
Dances
in honor of the pagan gods
were proscribed.
These seem to have been performed
on the 1st of March
which the canonist Balsamon
refers to as a great pagan festival.
The
dawning of comic, satiric
and tragic mask
were also prohibited.
Balsamon explicitly links
wearing of satiric mask
with the cult of Dionysus
who's called Liber,
Liber in Latin.
But this was not the only reason
for this law. It attacked
as well the custom
of mumming because the clergy
sometimes wore dramatic mask
at festivals and even brought
them into the churches.
Finally, men and women were
enjoined not to masquerade
as members of the opposite sex.
That's illegal too.
The detailed
attention given to these matters suggests
the cult of Dionysus
lasted among Christians
until the time of the council.
Although the urban population
of the empire probably kept the
Bromali as a mere holiday,
the agriculturist, particularly the wine
producers, inherited
this pagan cult as part of their trade.
Good for them.
