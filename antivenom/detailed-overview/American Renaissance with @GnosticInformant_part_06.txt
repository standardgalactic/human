with the caresses vine
there we go, excellent
that's it
that's what I wanted to present to you as
God of this country
as Liber
Venus and Bacchus, not Christ
that was
the most gorgeous moment
that I've had
in a very long time
I felt, I'm choking back tears
I'm serious, I'm choking back tears
because
isn't it amazing
Neil, when you
discover what your origin
is and you realize
what's behind it, isn't it gorgeous
what do you tell me something about America
that you know now that
I mean, that was just gorgeous but just
you know
let me say something on that, perfect
because when you look at history
it's very clear
when you start reading the primary sources
throughout time periods
just get a little bit of mercy in every century
start finding out who are the big writers
of every century and just start reading
a little bit about them and what they're talking about
and what's going on
and you see a clear shift
in the world
all the way back to the Bronze Age
through the classical period
through the Hellenistic era
all the way through the Roman Empire
and then there's a shift that happens
once
the temples get shut down
once people are no longer allowed
to express their spiritual
artistic
wants
things that they believe in
once you force dogma down people's throats
society goes from
being colorful and three-dimensional
to being two-dimensional, flat
and black and white
and dead, dark ages
that's the best way to describe it
there's so many people today that want to defend Christianity
from the term dark ages
like it's some sort of illegal thing to say
like you can't say dark ages anymore
that's not correct
but I challenge those people
all the time and they can never
let's go through the sources
what are the great classic literature
that we find from the 5th century
up until Dante
because Dante is great
I like Dante
I like some of these Renaissance writers
but what do you got
you got
there's nothing
good
yeah and Dante is drawing
the classical muse
he just took the 6th
of Virgil's
and he's like
I'm gonna blow this into a gigantic
work
that's another thing
the good works that you do find
are from crypto pagans
it's always some pagan shit
it's like what
there's a text from
Saint Maximus the Confessor
that's a classic text
not bullshit
I don't care about the trinity
I don't care about
what Augustine said about the nature
of Christ
that's all the text you're gonna get
from the dark ages
so it was dark ages
the literature is trash
Saint Maximus the Confessor
you hit that right on the head
who wants to read something from
Saint Maximus the Confessor
I don't want to read that trash
much less do I want to be forced
to have everybody
in society come up through
that trash
we're not gonna make that the basis
we're not gonna go backwards
right, Julian the Apostate
is sitting there yelling
he's like you've gotta stop them
the Christians are going to overthrow
your society
and they did
they did and they plunged us into the
depths
after a legal
can't burst out in the laughter anymore
not even that one text that I showed tonight
I found other texts
from similar time periods
where they'll talk about
excessive laughter is something
demonic
that people, a good Christian
is always very
keeps his cool and very stoic
and
and excessive
laughter is seen as like
and feminine and weak
it's ingrained
that's joy
that's all it is, you're making joy a bad thing
and this is what Nietzsche gets into
Christianity
it castrates
the spirit of humanity
and it makes
joy into something that's bad
and it makes being weak
into something that's good
completely flips everything
on its head
and pulls
the hilarious is bad
because we don't want to celebrate
the hilarious
I love it
I love it
tell me what you think
now that we're at this point
this is a question I really wanted to ask you
based on
all your life experience
everything that you have learned
from these texts
and how you've educated
yourself and kind of
made yourself all big brain
right from all of that
what is happening
now
to us as a people
if you're just to say
look we're going to go forward in time
because they're going to interview us the historians
in the future and they want to know
where were you mentally
where is
America mentally right now
it's
where is it mentally
well I mean this is a pretty
hectic time period with this election coming on
look
I'm not saying I like Joe Biden or anything
I'm not even going to get political right now but I'm just going to say
I don't like Joe Biden
I think he's gone
I don't think he even exists
I don't even think he exists
I'm a Joe Biden mythicist
I don't even think anyone's there
on the flip side of that
something very, very valid
is that there's some king
coming up or some new emperor
worshipping going on on the other side
so
what's the mental state of America right now
it's just two extreme sides
that are
ruining it for everybody in the middle
there you go
right I did want to say
because it's not political
and that's what Tom
Jefferson was trying to give us along
with a bunch of other people
was the ability to
exercise our politea
you know we got to do that Neil
I don't care people silence you
don't talk politics
excuse me
let's talk some history
that is politea
and what we're coming up on
is a radical shift
we're coming up to a radical shift
in power
in the United States of America
the entire world is watching
and it
just like the greeks said
the greeks said all the gods
abandoned
the greeks
you know what trump is
trump is Dionysus of Sicily
yeah right
I can see that
I can see that
but we have gotten
