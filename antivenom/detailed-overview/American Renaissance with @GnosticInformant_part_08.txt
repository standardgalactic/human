which is going out and having a frenzy
and enjoying nature
and worshiping and
not condemning what is natural
but
pursuing it
instead
and then you have a flipping of the poles
happening at the end of the 5th century
right after Euripides performs the Bacchai
the next year the 30 tyrants are all out
so
my prediction is
my prediction is that we're in a state
right now where
there needs to be
a performance such as Euripides
and I don't
mean like there needs to be another Bacchic play
I mean people need to be inspired
and those people who are inspired
need to inspire other people
in order to produce
some sort of
what Socrates
described as divine mania
that is what
that's the one thing that I would say
is why I'm not an atheist
because I do think that there is something
about inspiration
that is
that can't be described
without metaphysics
so the stage
we need that
that Bacchic theater back
I
totally understand that
my fear is
the stage that we have today
all the platforms whether it's
movies or whatever
YouTube
all the platforms we have today are not
the sacred Bacchic stage
could we bring back the
purificate I mean it would have to be
us we'd have to bring it back ourselves
you know and maybe
that's the point but
you notice how
with that council of 692
they were replacing
they were replacing these rituals
these ancient agricultural rituals
of wine production
that involved chanting out to
Dionysus
an excessive laughter
that gets replaced
with church dogma
so those old pagan temples
where wine production was being
done at gets replaced
with by a church if we go to Elucis today
in Athens there's a church there
if we go to Crete today near
Mount Ida a holy
Ida from all these ancient texts there's a church
there too all these ancient
sites there's a church there now
so that is the reverse
we need to go back to
maybe even repurposing old
broken down churches that no one's using
and converting that into
something like a theater yeah
yeah there's got to be some way
that I think
I think you hit on there with Elucis
if you
can reproduce the mysteries
you can purge
your society I don't think
modern theater
can do that because modern theater
and movies they're all tied into money
right if we were to
somehow bring out
the actual performance
do the actual purgations
you know I'm talking about all the
wizardry all the drugs
all the
death induction of death
and resurrection you know we're going to lose a few
I
think that you could then purge
the society but we don't have that mechanism
even those pagans
that's the main thing that needs to be done
inspiration needs to be happening
yeah
when you lose that
inspiration society is dead
that's why people like Petrarch
and Machiavelli and Brumi and
all these guys were calling it the Dark Ages
because they're looking at the texts
they're looking at the classical literature and going
it's dead
it's dark there's no more colorful
there's no more mythology
it's all dark
the only word to describe it is dark
yeah
so it needs to be colored back up again
it doesn't lead you to Aphrodite
and Bacchus does it
that's why
that is the message of that song
and that's the chorus
that's the
what do you call it the main line of a song
called the chorus right
notice how every time that chorus hit
it was always
with the myrtle with Venus
and Bacchus is vine
yeah
because that entwined with the myrtle and the vine
that's the light bringing
God Lucifer
that was a gorgeous
that was a gorgeous
whoever wrote that
that really is Inaugurion that wrote that song
or is that an ode to Inaugurion
that's what those Brits were coming up with
studying
and trying to take on the spirit now
and they know Inaugurion was big
because
Aeschylus
who was really the master of bringing that
Bacchic procession to the stage
he
was a big fan
so big into Inaugurion
used a lot of what was in Inaugurion
already lots of illusions to it
so
a whole vein of beautiful
beautiful clear water that spring
that they hit into
that thing reverberated all the way up to those Brits
in the 18th century
who were sitting around to having
their anachronistic club
yeah
fantastic thank you
I said we would get back to the Brits right
thank you Islanders
for your contribution
those Brits were Liberty Loving Brits
who were in association
with
were also
helping out the Americans
that were trying to fight against King George
they weren't like
what's the word of the Brits that
follows George
whatever you call that
I'm not a
American Revolution
yeah but no there's like a name
for the ones who are
follow under George
that aren't the rebels
those Anachronistic people were not those guys
they were rebels
they were rebel spirits
and it's not just in Brits
it's also in French
when you look into the sources
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington
were in deep communication
with the liberal French
so this is
right before Napoleon comes along
there was this Liberty Movement
in France
aligned with the Liberty Movement
in England
which is also aligned with the Liberty Movement in America
there was a huge Liberty Movement
happening across the globe
basically
that's where Tom got all his wine from
is from that French
I think the French kept that
Libertas
I think they kept that bottled up in their ground
and they sucked it out through that wine
I think they did the same thing
they were doing in antiquity
oh god and if you don't think
that the French have a propensity
to be drawn
to Aphrodite and Bacchus
you're like oh have you lived
have you lived have you been over there
go over there right now man
oh god
that's what neoclassical
art is like in its prime
is in the French
in the 18th century France
where they start building up new museums
and statues
of Venus or Hermaphroditus
and Bacchus
