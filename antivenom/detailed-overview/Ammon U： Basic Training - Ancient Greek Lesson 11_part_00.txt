Zombies.
The little bitch that you give to the goddess, Athena follows Odysseus around.
She makes men fulfill their desires to be worth a woman.
Cristen with Aphrodisiac.
Once you are out producing the theory egg, watch out if your brain will open up.
Athena with a purple cuff.
She's your woman.
Crush.
You begin the place.
You get better.
She's your woman.
She's your woman.
Crush.
You begin the place.
You get better.
She's your woman.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon.
This is Armin you tonight and I am going to bring you zombies.
Yes, I'm going to bring you zombies and I'm very glad.
I'm very glad to be able to teach the Bible like this.
I don't know why nobody teaches this.
Straight out of the gospels people.
That's where I'm taking you tonight.
Straight out of the gospels.
We are going to go back and look at Jesus and we're going to see the zombies.
I'm going to pull that out and show you.
Be careful tonight.
It may mess with your head a little bit.
You may have a little too much of that reality.
And speaking of reality, it's a real thing that people are critiquing.
It's a real thing that people are now looking thanks to you satanic congregation.
People are looking at Jesus and his naked boy and his title Christ.
People are now looking at it.
Why is that so important?
It's important because they're meat.
Fresh meat.
Okay, let's go to this first clip.
Before we do, I just want to set this up for you.
I want you to think of the back alley.
You're in the back alley.
It's too late.
You're in the back alley and here are the back alley artists.
They're going to give it to you because you trust them.
Are you ready?
The funny thing is they go back to the same thing.
They go back to the same thing.
The missed tight box went back too.
Are you ready?
Hit the first one, Chewie.
I'm pulling up the Greek and this dude is just flat out lying.
We're looking up, this is Mark in the Greek and it says,
And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth
cast about his naked body and the young man laid hold on him.
And so when we look at that word for cloth,
it has nothing to do with penis.
No, and there's no any window in the text implying that at all.
The cloth.
Okay, now I just want to stop.
I want to say stop.
This is going to be yummy, but watch what's going on here.
Do you get the idea that maybe he is some kind of Greek expert
or at least trained in Greek?
He's reading.
Don't be too right.
You can smell the amateurish nature of it.
You know what he's doing?
He's reading to you a polyclot.
He's reading to you an English translation on the left
with the Greek sprinkled on the right.
And you know what that does not mean?
That does not mean you're reading the Greek.
Bring it up.
Bring it up.
Show them what it is.
No, not that.
Not that the first.
It's the first one.
Yes.
There we go.
Bring it up.
Yes.
No, not Lucifer.
Give me that.
We'll bring him back, people.
This is the first they're referring to.
This is the first they're referring to.
Peripeble menocendona.
That's the rag he was talking about, the sendona, the bandage.
And what does that verb say?
It says he's got it wrapped around something.
Now, look, wait, you got to bring it back.
Hey, get him out of here.
Jesus, get out of here.
Be gone.
Look at that.
I have the power of the devil.
I can make Jesus go away.
Hail Satan.
All right.
He's got something wrapped around him.
Right?
Part of him is wrapped in this sendon, in this linen bandage.
And look at the last two words.
Where is it?
Is it a cloak?
No.
It's on his private parts.
It says it in Greek.
You were not reading the Greek, sir.
You were reading an English translation.
I want you to look.
Give it to me.
You know what this means?
You know what this means, Christian?
This means on your genitalia.
On your genitalia.
Covering his genitalia.
Now, I hate to throw the genitalia in your face like that.
No, I don't.
I don't.
I love doing it.
Everybody here knows that.
Right?
Oh my God.
Play that clip.
Give one more time.
Same clip.
Joey, play it.
Pulling up the Greek.
And this dude is just flat out lying.
Like we're looking up.
This is Mark in the, in the Greek.
And it says, and there followed him a young certain.
And they're following a certain young man having a linen cloth.
Cast about his naked body and the young man laid hold on him.
Yeah.
And so when we look at that word for cloth,
it has nothing to do with penis.
No.
And there's no any window in the text implying that at all.
Of course the cloth has nothing to do with the penis.
Of course it doesn't know.
We're talking about where the wrap is positioned.
And it says it explicitly.
It's on his private.
Now,
this is the thing that comes off when the kid runs away.
And when he runs away,
what, what is the author extremely careful to point out?
Give me the next one.
He's extremely careful to point out.
It's a big deal.
It's dirty stuff, Mark.
Right.
Give me the next one.
It's the next one.
What is,
yep.
That's what he is down here.
Keep going.
Boom.
Boom.
Oh God.
I'd lost my track tonight.
Our star charts are off.
Our star charts are off.
Well, it's okay.
It'll come up.
Let's go back to this.
This is what he says.
He says he runs away naked.
Naked.
Cover up that part.
The bandage fell off and the kid runs away naked.
Naked.
Now, people are always like,
people are getting away now.
What?
Tell me about those kids that he's with.
Okay.
I'll show you the kids that Jesus is with.
I'm going to show you and spitting in their faces.
I'm going to show him doing stuff that is degrading.
Stuff that he has to say when he's in the midst of it.
He has to say, pay attention and don't be tempted.
What a pervert.
What a pervert this guy is.
You want to go to one of these things?
Let's go to one of them.
Give me the second clip.
He's trying to say that Jesus was involved in this prayer.
It's utter nonsense.
The Christians were the one ending this man-boy nonsense.
This evil, horrible pedophilia of practices.
And they're getting their ideas from a Jesus-todden New Testament.
And there's nothing in Mark 14 about Jesus having relations with any sort of young boy.
This guy is just making things up that's not in the Greek.
And he's pretending it's there to fit the conclusion he wants.
He is not being honest.
Yeah.
Anything else you want to get from this clip or should we move on?
No.
It's from crazy town.
It's utter nonsense.
