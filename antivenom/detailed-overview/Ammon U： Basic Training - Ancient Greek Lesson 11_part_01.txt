There's nothing nice I can say about what he's saying.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
No, it's just ancient Greek, which you have no familiarity with.
I can tell if I was considering whether or not to have you in my class with my raw new recruits.
I wouldn't have you in that class.
There's no way you can do those paradigms.
I guarantee it.
This dude does not have the capacity to sit around on his couch and read Greek.
Ancient Greek.
He does not have it.
And you can smell it.
And Gnostic is going to come on in a minute and show you exactly what we're talking about.
Exactly.
Yeah.
No, we didn't announce him.
Sorry, Chewie.
I just told Chewie for the first time.
Sorry, Chewie.
Yeah.
Gnostic is going to come on.
But he knows this is going to take me a while because I have to give you a picture.
I have to provide you that actual dirt that comes through Mother Greek.
And that's what I'm going to do tonight.
Give me the first.
It's okay.
Give me the...
Oh, you're going to send him...
Oh, Chewie is sending him link.
Okay.
Thanks.
Boom.
We did it.
Now let's go.
Give me the...
This one.
That's okay.
Oh, yes.
No, Lucifer.
Oh, man.
We almost forgot Lucifer.
By the way, everybody, Lucifer says, souls who dare use their immortality, souls who
dare look the omnipotent tyrant in his everlasting face and tell him that his evil is not good.
Thank you, Lucifer.
Boom.
Thank you, Lucifer, very much.
At least you know who you are, right?
That's the whole Bacchic initiation.
You've got no idea.
Those guys who were critiquing, they've got no idea.
And it's funny.
People who are looking into the mirror always throw the accusations that are coming to them.
Dishonest.
Excuse me if there's one thing Satanic congregation knows.
It's that Amun is honest, yeah, because he has a contract with the devil.
You see, it doesn't work if I fabricate, because the fabrication is what?
It's a pursuit of profit.
It's a pursuit of profit.
You want to follow the tyrant?
You want that profit?
Oh, you do.
You know you do.
You know you do.
Praise Jesus.
Hey, Satan, give it to me.
What's that next one here, people?
Just come along for the ride.
I know it's going to be good, because I gave it to you here.
What?
Oh, look, this comes from my master's thesis.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All these things I consider should be done for the child up to the third year, listen
to this medicine, from his birth, and especially this nurse should observe no little care as
to her food, drink, sleep, sexual life, and exercise in order that her milk may be of
the best quality.
Take it down.
Look at that.
Look at the way that they're using milk.
Do you know that your sexual activity can influence the quality of your milk?
If you didn't know that, you're behind these people, these are the cultures that we're
dealing with, the level of sophistication.
When you say Christ somebody, there's a verse everybody knows in Revelation in the apocalypse
talking about you must.
You must Christ your eyes, and everybody looks around, and these guys that critique, look
around because they don't know what that means, they don't know what's going on.
Who is being dishonest?
Look into the Bacchic mirror.
Yes, St. Tainan congregation, did you realize what we're doing?
We're holding up the Bacchic mirror, and they're looking into it.
It's gorgeous.
Somebody must be spanked.
Who shall we spank?
Who shall we spank?
Tonight, this one is for all you evangelicals.
This is to opening your eyes.
You don't expect it.
You don't expect the sting.
He's a crazy man, mommy.
He is Jimmy.
Don't watch his YouTube, Jimmy.
It's going to corrupt you.
You give him lock to the people who are corrupting the youth.
Where's that kid?
How old is that kid?
Can we finally just nail down the age of this SOB that was with Jesus naked when he was
arrested with a bandage on his hoo-ha?
Let's just nail him down.
Tonight, let's show him.
Come on, bring it out.
Let these people in awe.
Let them have their awe.
Give me the next one.
Nope.
Next one.
Boom.
In Ellis, democracies drank too much and went insane.
What's the cause of his insanity?
He's a black bile.
He took the drug and was purged.
Oh, God, where are we?
Are we in a hospital or are we in some kind of temple with incense and fumigation and
priests saying, don't eat or drink for so long?
Much was purged from him.
He produced phlegm and black bile throughout the day.
These are the words of a Greek physician.
This evening, he stopped the purging.
That's good.
The guy's been giving that guy a little sponge.
He had much pain in the purging.
It sounds like he drank barley broth.
Huh.
I've heard that before.
Sleep took him and held him all night until the sun was high.
Isn't that nice?
You know what happens when you give people drugs and rituals?
You control.
This is just the medicine in sleep.
He did not seem to those who were present to be breathing, but to have died.
But he survived.
Praise Jesus.
Praise Jesus.
Do you see what the Christ is doing?
Do you want to see what the Christ is doing?
Do you want to enter death and be born again?
Do you want to enter that life?
Do you want it?
Do you want to have Ionic life?
Do you want to have it?
Okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.
The Christians and the Christians are sitting around because they have been poisoned and
they are in a coma for more than a thousand years.
They've been fed a drug in their food, fed a drug.
Do you want to see it?
Do you want to see it as long as it's got some of that blister beetle?
I'm willing to be here, right?
Can you taste it?
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Do you want the Christians can't get that one?
Demon possession, to be under the power of a diamond baby, to suffer by a defying visitation,
to be possessed, to be mad.
Do you know what starts the ministry of that dude who was given the funds by the creeps
who carry all the drugs?
Do you know what he did?
He battled demons.
He fought demons.
And he fought the king of demons in a little place called Void.
Don't touch his shit.
It will make you see things.
Okay.
All right.
Shall we go in?
Shall we go in?
Is he summoned?
I think he's summoned.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
I want to show you another word, daimoni anzo.
Right?
Right?
Oh, my God, to be deified, possessed by an evil, an evil spirit.
Fantastic.
Look at the tech on these people.
Do you know there's no distinction between those demons that you see when you're Christed
and the drug-induced hallucinations that the doctors write about?
Huh.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Can you smell the reality?
You thought it was about daimons.
Daimon be gone.
Right?
No.
It's going to end up with us somewhere, somewhere in the backwoods with Jesus and Mary and somebody
is going to be self-pleasuring and going to offer it to the other to eat.
Where is that naked kid that is with Jesus?
Where is that naked kid?
You wanted me to show him to you tonight.
You want me to show you from the Bible, the naked kid that is with that creep when he
is arrested screaming, I am not a trafficker.
Give me the next.
