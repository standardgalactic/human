A second renaissance
Another drip from the glow and chalice
I'm with Medea's team
Everything I see is cream
Straight from the bang
Of the dragon
The tracks bump
It is the same
Athena knows my slang
In the dark harbor
The drugs wear done
Kachanga Lane
Creed Moore hit the mark
Bang bang
We're here to save the children
The museum we're building
Anti-Christ prescription
Dragan Venom, Ellen
Chalice, Adrien Venom
High purple Vine 211
Medea hit you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring it back to the dead
Welcome back
This is a new thing we've got going tonight
To our audience that is large
I thank you for coming out
I value your time and I don't intend to
Take advantage of you
At least, not in that way
What I'd like to do is
I'd like to begin tonight
And just kind of guide you in
To the opening of AmenU
Let me tell you what I have to offer tonight
I have something so
Oh God, it's luscious
What I'm going to do is in a minute
I'm going to step down and I'm going to
Let the drill instructor in
The drill instructor is going to get you going
But first
But first
I was thanking to myself
And I thought, you know what
Something, something, it was unimportant
When I was thanking you know, typical me
And somebody called me and said
Take a look at this video
And I took a look at this video and it was
Some poetry
A vision
It was a vision
Of Marilyn Manson
And I want to bring that up now
Just to set as the ship is going
And you're about to enter
AmenU and see the structure
Pristine, gorgeous
Condition
As your mind
Gets off
Gets off
That place
Of
Slowness
And starts working like it should
Nature intended
Like those athletes
Oh God, you mean I could have been like that
This is that
For your mind
Are you ready people?
Let's get the little Marilyn Manson in here
Thank you
Chewie bring that more towards me so I can see it
I had a dream last night
Said Marilyn
And remember
This is the child of Marilyn Monroe
And Charles Manson
Right, the image child
Of Marilyn Monroe
And Charles Manson
You want to hear that dream?
I said do you want to hear that dream?
I was drowning in a sea of liquor
And I washed up
On a beach made of cocaine
The sky was made of LSD
And every tree
Was made of marijuana
But the cops pulled me over
They did not arrest me
Instead
They blanked my blank
And it was so beautiful
That God came down from heaven
He said to me
Marilyn Manson
We will no longer spell the word God
G-O-D
I said how do you want to spell it God
He said
Give me a D
Give me an R
Give me a U
Give me a G
Give me an S
And what does that spell
It spells
The history
That Marilyn Manson
Had tapped into
Through the muse
It spells
A-L-I-C-E
Alice
Oh God are we going to Wonderland
When I bring in this drill instructor
To you
You're going to Wonderland
Give me a couple of these I want to warm up
Everybody tonight before we get to it
Give me that second one
Is it possible
Is it possible
Mr. Manson
To
Take
Two things and meld them together
It is in the Greek
Mind, it is in the mind of those
Who had children
And one of them was named Alice
Oh God
What a freak
Here we go
This is a pharmacomantis
People you're going to be going in
For instruction tonight I want you to see
Some of the power of the T and T
That you're dealing with
Look at pharmacomantis
One who is at once pharmacos
And mantis
Oh that's fantastic
Or who uses pharmaca
Why
To divine
What does that divining
Have to do with anything
To be in the ion
In order to see the future
It's called
Ionic life
Can you hear the cult
In the language
Ionic life
The drill instructor is going to tell you
Who you are
I'm going to set this up by saying
Can you have something that is at once
A drug
And a vision
Can you have something
That is a prophetic power
That gives you the ability
To see the future
Can you have that skill
It turns out it's a romance
And you're very lucky tonight
You're very lucky just as I was lucky
When I first sat in greek
101 how lucky I was
I had no idea what was coming
I had no idea the things
It would do to me
And how it would follow me
And after 30 plus years
Every day
Every day me and greek
We are in the kitchen
We're in the bedroom
We're in the office
Where are we not
Where do we not just rub it all
Over each other
You know what I mean
Oh god every day
Something new her mind
Is so expansive
Marilyn Manson
Did was he tapped into
That well
And was able to pull out
Those daimonase
Those what
Those daimonase
Those powers
Look at that word one more time
The pharmacomantis right
Who is that mantic
It is that person who knows
Who knows
Think about that for a minute
Just stop it's a combination
Of a drug and a seer
What kind of woman fits the bill
For that
Oh it's in the
Mind and antiquity I'm going to give you
A couple of concepts that we do not have
In anglo-saxon
Where is he
Frederick come here Frederick
You stupid
