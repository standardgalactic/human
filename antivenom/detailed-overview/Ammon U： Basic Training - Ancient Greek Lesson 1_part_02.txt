Okay we'll start with demon
What is a demon or a
Diamond, a diamond is a power
And one of its definition is that of
Daemon, it's the same thing
It's something that is
Knowing, so you can have a daemon
Mahes, and that is
Somebody skilled in battle
Skilled in fighting
Right, it means skilled
Or knowing, those demons
What are they, they're known
Now you're going to stop, what I want you to do
Stop all your preconceived notions
Of demons, I'm just going to
Lay it out for you, what the reality was
That never existed, unfortunately
Most of what you
Know
Is an unreality
The attainment of Greek
Is the reconnection
With the real
And it brings renaissance
And so that's why I'm happy
And privileged to have
Such a great audience
My god, there's almost a thousand of you
How much honor do we owe these people?
How much honor?
Look at this people, daemon
What's a daemon, what's it
Knowing or experienced
Right, somebody who is knowing
Or experienced in something, next one
Next one
Boom
From the verb da, oh now
This is what they said in antiquity
That this
Term daemon, this noun daemon
Was derived from the verb
Like many many
The overwhelming majority
Of ancient Greek words
They're derived from the verb
And I want you to think about that
I want you to think about that
The difference between a verb
And a noun
That's the dyad
That they've got in grammar
You mean they're talking about
Dyads and monads
And grammar?
Yeah, you know why?
Logos
Logos
Reckoning
Computation
Oh god, that's getting me excited
Learn, right?
To learn, dao, what is dao?
To learn, right?
Or to learn isn't to teach
I'm going to learn you something
You know what I mean? Watch this though
Dio is also a potential
For candidate for this root
That this word is from
Means to burn up or to consume
To consume
The seeds of fire
What she possesses
Uh-huh
Baptism
By fire. Does anybody understand that expression?
Nope, you don't
You haven't seen the real one
I'll show it to you. Are you ready here
To burn up? Give me the next one
Oh god, what is the daemon?
I'm burning, I'm knowing
What am I? This is the other thing
Look, it's haemon
Haemon
And what does that mean? It means to be
Eager
To be eager for something
And they show you the victorians
They said look, it equals daemon
For daemon
Okay, okay
I'm starting to get it. I'm starting to feel the daemon
That blood at the bottom
I'm going to have to put that
That old word haima
Originally means blood
And or semen
Blood
And or semen
So what that has to do
With an eager knowledge
Is going to have to be something that you
Steal upon
Yes
Then you can stand on the sand with the beast
Do you understand?
Then you go, okay, no
Of course, let's go. Hurry up, the drilling structure is waiting
Um, look at the fadamaka here
Oh god, I wanted you guys to see the
Fadamaka and the Alexa Daddy
Of that antidote
Um, lots of, oh god
The works of, oh
All right, this is, all right
You're in for a treat
You're in for a treat, so I'm glad
That we're going to go ahead and get started
And what I need to do now
Is I'm going to want you to put the text on there
And I'm going to call in the drill instructor
Wait a minute, did I have a
Oh, I'll save that for the ending
I'll give you a little something at the ending
It is a
It is a verse
From the
Hebrew
Writings that were
The translation of the original
Greek writings called the Septuagint
And it is
Laughably, if anybody
Is denying me
Is saying, no, no, no
This man is lunatic, I've got the hardest
Core evidence just to show you
The fact that the Greek
Is aiming for
And achieving a much higher level
Of technical expertise
And the Hebrew is a very simple
Very low vocabulary
Very third grade
Reading
So, but that's the best that you
Can do with that Hebrew
I'm going to show you an example of that
But I'm going to flash your textbook up here now
And what I'm going to do
Is I'm going to grab
The drill instructor
And I'm going to meet myself
And just give me a minute here
Look at your textbook
However you can get this textbook
Please feel free to
I don't know
To find whatever ways necessary
People have been telling me
Amen
Thank you for giving
Everybody an opportunity
To be able to
Enter this
Well, you know, it's the
Request and the devil
Telling me, dude, you can't
You've got to make this available
For everyone, right?
You've got to really
You want to really undercut
Get down to the
Nitty gritty and pull up that
Renaissance, you've got to do this
So, I appreciate it
I'll be back in 30 seconds
Thank you
It's nice to meet you
I'm your drill instructor
Let, before we begin
Let me tell you who you are
And then I'll tell you who I am
Okay
You are the downtrodden
You are the slaves
Of your Anglo-Saxon
Crappery
You have come here
To make yourself
You have come here
To make yourself
Something better
You've seen some honor
And you've been attracted to it
You've had some thirst
And it's drawn you
And you want this
You really, really want this
You will succeed
Because of who I am
Who am I?
I'm your instructor
And I've been working with this language
For 30 plus years
Humbly every day
You're going to come in here
With certain preconceived notions
Some of you will come in here
With seminary work
By the way, welcome
Welcome to all the monists
It's nice to have you
