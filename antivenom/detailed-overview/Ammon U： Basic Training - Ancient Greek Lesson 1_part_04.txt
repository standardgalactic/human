It's very foreign to modern Greek
So what is the modern Greek
It doesn't matter
I don't want to offend
We can put the Anglo-Saxon speakers
We can put the French
And the Celtic tongue
We can put all those things
In one giant container
Because none of them
Historically reached
What the Greek did
Okay, let's get into
That next letter
Gamma
What am I giving you people
I'm giving you the capital letter
On the left
And the tiny one
On the right
And what are you going to do
Look at those shapes again
It's two strokes
Left and down
Right and down
Two little strokes
Gorgeous
I want you to memorize this
Look, it's got a tail to it
Oh, God
Sexy letters
Epsilon
Pretty straightforward
Ready for the next one
Zeta
Wait, what?
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to let you say Zeta
And we're going to pronounce it with a Z
Z
But you've got to realize this is a combination
Right, D and S
Right
Oh, God
Look at this one, next one
Eta, I kind of have a thing for Eta
Right, look at the way
Look at the way that lowercase Eta
I mean, it looks like an H
But look at the lowercase
Oh, God
You're going to love that
It's got like a leg sticking out
Let me show you my leg
Give me the theta
Pretty straightforward people
And this font is pretty
Universal
This is a good font
Eota
Keep going, kappa
Look at the kappa, notice the kappa
And the lowercase looks like
Kind of an X
When you're looking at it, it kind of looks like an X
It's not, it's a kappa
You love that?
Next one, lambda
Look at lambda
You say, wait a minute
I see people with that on their shield
That's because
You're watching a bunch of laconians
Give me the mu
Look at the mu
Oh, again, crevaceous
That's callipigenus
That mu is callipigenus, give me the new
Look, it looks like a V
In English, yes
The new, which makes an N sound
Looks like a V
That may be confusing at first
But it'll wear off
Look at the next letter
Xe
Oh, this one
Look at that, look at the capital
And by the way, you know
You're asking yourself, what is the difference
In these styles?
Look at this letter Xe
This is the letter Xe, which is a kappa
And a sigma next to each other
X
You say this all the time
Right?
Look at that, licks
My cheek
Licks
Well, they just made a letter out of it
Right? And looking on the left
You see that capital
Look, it's just three bars
I can see through that
It's a long bar followed by a short bar
And underneath that's another long bar
Now, why do you think that difference is?
Because those, what we're calling
Lower case letters
Those are things that monks make up
Right? Those are things that people
Who want to write
Make up on
Parchment
Give me a skin
People are writing things on skins
There's a lot of skins, there's no books
There's no books, there's scrolls
There's scrolls and buildings
Full of scrolls called libraries
And shh, don't tell anyone
The Christians will burn them all down
If you want to check on that
Go ahead and check on that
Galen was complaining, but be quiet
Shhh
Look at the C
The left side is for stone
The right side is for
Parchment
Isn't that amazing?
You didn't know there was a different element
In those
Upper case and lower case letters, did you?
No, you didn't
Go, Omicron
Oh, it looks just like an O
Sorry, Omicron, but you're kind of boring
P
And don't say Pi
If you say Pi for this
I'm going to virtually punch you in the mouth
Yes
Psychically
What
What happened?
Don't say Pi, Pi is for nerds
Who study physics
Oh God, it's maybe some geometry
Maybe some geometry, but this is
P
P
Row
Wait a minute, I thought that one was a P
It was a P, this is a row
But that's an English P
That's because Anglo-Saxon speak
With rocks in their mouths
Give me the next one
Sigma
Sigma, when it's big
It can be that
Kind of
Grabby looking
And when it's small, look
When it's that first sigma
In this case, you use that internally
Okay, internally
In a word, in the middle of a word, you use that
Right, we're starting out
But if you're going to end a word
In a sigma, you've got to use the one that looks like
An S
It kind of looks like a snake thing
Good, how about Tao
Tao, oh God
A little bit curvaceousness
A little bit, just gets a little flirty
But you know, go
Upsilon
Ooh
Ooh, do you know what
Upsilon does? Upsilon hides a
Diagma
What? There's a letter called a Diagma
And the Upsilon hides it
When there's an Upsilon there, she's like
Ooh, come here, Diagma
Right, and that's how you can age
Words
You perverts
That's how you age words
I'm going to show you, you know who showed me
The guy who works for
The American intelligence
Naval intelligence
Cracking codes
In World War II
He also helped crack
Linear B
And he taught me
Where the Diagma hides
Wait a minute
Are we talking about the same thing?
Give me the fee
Roll out fee here, everybody loves fee
I don't know why, but everybody loves fee
Right, now if you say
Phi, I'm going to say
Fo-fum
I smell
The gas
Of an Englishman? Is that how it goes?
No, because that's your nursery rhymes
This is fee, people
