Fee
Fee, fee, it makes a
Ph sound, love it
Give me the next one
This is not native
To England accent, but it's a he
Wait a minute, what?
Did he just hiss at me? Yeah, he did
Right, he
This is a he
Right, good, and
Another doublet here, nice following
The Psi
Not the Psi
The Psi
The Psi, and what does the Psi do?
It's a P
And a Sigma, together
Psst, that's nice
The word
Fultures
Gips
Okay
Omega
Omega, everybody knows what Omega is
This thing has been used
All over
All over for symbols
Oh god, if I had a
Omega
Give me the letter after Omega
Where's my diagram, did you hide my
There she is, boom
Boom, and finally
Those were 24 letters, you're responsible
For those, by next session
And what I need you to do
And please follow me
Exactly, stand in the shower
Sit on the toilet driving your car
Doesn't matter, Alpha
Beta, gamma, delta, epsilon
Zeta, eta, theta, eota,
Kappa, lambda, mu, nu, C
Omicron, P, rho,
Sigma, tau, Upsilon
Phi, he, Psi, Omega
That's how we're gonna say them
Please say them that way
And I need you to have the entire
Alphabet down
If you will follow
My instructions and this week
You will draw these out
Whatever it takes, my students say
There's lots of different ways
Right, I drew them out
When I was learning them
Okay, what it's gonna do
For your brain
The very imaging
Of those letters
Are symbols
That the language itself
Employs
Oh, can you believe that?
There's two layers
Of complexity here
We have the verbal meaning
Or association
And we have
The image produced
By the letter
You say, wait a minute
I didn't think people would do that
What do we have here? Di-gamma
Di-gamma, yeah
Like an F, it does
But it's pronounced like a W
Wa
Wa, give me the word
I'm gonna give you an example
I'm gonna start with this
Greek word
Wanasa
Now you say, wait a minute
It starts with an alpha
So how is
Wanasa? Because
There is a di-gamma
Hidden in there
Look people, take down
Look at the first word here
It says Wanasa
Wanasa, right
Okay, the queen lady
Addressed to goddesses
We don't have these anymore
I'm sorry to say, they died
They died, the last one was like
500 AD
Yeah, they died
It's a shame, I'd like to have them back
Is there any way to get
These women back?
Okay, go to the next one
Boom
I wanna go through a word list
I wanna go through a word list
We can work backwards
That's fine, you're gonna go up from here
Are you ready? We're starting at the end of the alphabet
We're looking at the first letter
And this word is
Okeanos
Okeanos
Notice the accent
Is that little slash above
The omicron
Second to last letter
The only thing you're gonna do with that accent
Is you're gonna stress it
You're gonna spend twice as much time on it
Are you ready? The proper
Pronunciation is
Okeanos
Okeanos
It's not
Okeanos
And it's not Okeanos
It's Okeanos
You're putting a little extra time
On that syllable
Where the stress accent is
Here's another one
Next letter behind
Drunken driving
And they're making us go through the alphabet
We're having to do it backwards
Psy
Psy is the first letter
Psyche
Oh, by the way, what do people think
Okeanos is?
Ocean
You mean my concept of ocean
It comes from this language
You write it
Many, many, many of your words
We're stolen from it
Again, I'm sorry, it's just superior
We didn't borrow any ancient Persian
There's a reason for that
Greeks were right there
They could have
Functionality
It turns out, just like in nature
It's survival of the fittest
With languages
God, this language is so fit
Look at that Psy
Psyche
This is the word for soul
In English, we get psychology
Psychology
Good, go to the next one
Philosophia
Philosophia
I had one instructor from Arizona
Tell me
This is really an aspirated P
So it should be pronounced
Philosophia
But 99% of the classes
Pronounce Philosophia
Okay, shout out
To that one learner
Humnos
What is a humnos?
It's a hymn
It's a hymn
There are two marks over the
Upsilon that starts this word
The first is a rough breathing
Rough breathing
Only the things that I say
Do you need to learn
It is a rough breathing
And it means you add an H
To that vowel
So this is humnos
Humnos
Not humnos
But humnos
And what is that? It's a song
You mean when I sing hymns
In English
I want you to notice that the English
That was stolen from this
Starts with an H
Why? Because it's the Greek rough breathing
It's an aspiration
Love it
That's the end
Look at the towel that starts
That towel
Keep going up
Now that row
That's on the front of this
I want you to put a little
Trill on it
You don't have to put a ton
Oh god
It's got a rough breathing
You've got to put a little puff of air
Oh, you little puff of air
