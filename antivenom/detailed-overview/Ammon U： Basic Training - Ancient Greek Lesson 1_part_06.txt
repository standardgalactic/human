And make your tongue go up and down
Something's going on here
This is something musical
Riza
Riza
And what is a Riza?
It's a root
It's a root
And look, here's some purgative medicines
Look what I brought you tonight
You can purge yourself with these roots
You know what I mean? Because sometimes
Sometimes you don't want to stop up the pipes
You need the stuff to keep going
Right?
Well, you've got roots
And you've got root cutters
What do we get in English? Of course, Rhizome
Rhizome, right?
Go back up, keep going up
How about this?
Omicron orchestra
What is an orchestra?
You're gonna say, oh, I know, I know
It's orchestra in English
And it is, but it isn't
Right?
What is an orchestra in antiquity?
It's a place where you dance
It's a place where you dance
Okay
You mean they danced?
Yeah, it's religious
Celebrations, right?
When you go to the tragedy
To be purged
Don't you think you ought to
Be able to enjoy a chorus?
Not like a tragic chorus, man
I had one at St. Mary's
It was a chorus of furies
And they were dressed absolutely
It was gorgeousness and
Gorgeousity
All wrapped up into one
It was black
It was leather
And it was fury
Just the, you know
Dilda waving fury
Yeah, Mad Max
Kind of style
Loved it, loved it
Yeah, stood for the value
The Montseignee said, this stands for the values
That we should uphold
Ksenos, what's a Ksenos?
That's a stranger
Now look, this word
Is actually really neat
This will show you a little bit
Of the history and I want you to hear this
Please hear this, are you ready?
Ksenos, Ksenos
What is a Ksenos?
That's the dude
That you are obliged
To give a bath to
And some food to
And a bunk to stay the night
Yeah, wait what?
Is that a
Yeah, no, this is a legal thing
And it's protected by the cult of none other
Than Zeus himself
Yeah
And they call this thing
This magical thing
Okay, you have an obligation
Dude shows up to your door at sunset
And he's like, look, I've been walking
For the last eight hours
And I need a place to stay for the night
You have a religious obligation
To give him a room
And you're supposed to give him a gift too
Right now, here's the thing
He goes back to wherever he's going
He leaves his information with you
And when you're traveling
You have a right to stay with him
Why? Because you
Have a relationship
Called Xenia
Oh yeah
Oh god, now
That's giving you a little bit
The words will give you the
Dust that was in the air of antiquity
Xenos, we got a few more goodies here
Nektar
Do you want to drink some Nektar?
You know that looks like nectar in English
Look how stupid we are in English
Can we not invent a word
That was the equivalent of nectar?
Seriously?
No, we'll just steal it from them
Because what do they do?
What did Anglo-Saxon speakers do?
What did the Angles and the Saxons
Did they always sit around
And they probably just hunted and stuff
You know, come on people
There's nothing wrong with hunting
Greeks hunt too, but do something with your language
Nektar
So gorgeous
That's what the gods drink
Now wait a minute, I thought I just told you at the beginning
That God was a combination of drugs
And vision
Yeah, you know how you get there? Nectar
You know what the Greeks said?
Listen to how drug using this
Culture is
They said that nectar
Is what gives the gods
Their immortality
That is the source
You mean there's drugs that give immortality?
Yes
Salvation comes
Through drugs
People, there's 1200 of you
Thank you for your time
Salvation is through drugs
In the ancient world
When I say salvation
I mean everything
I mean medicine
I mean the salvation you're thinking of
I'm thinking psychological salvation
Same thing
Salvation through drugs
Christ is a drug term
Now you see
Who you are
You have no idea
What kind of person you are
You have no idea what kind of life you're leading
You're in the dark
And that
Is what Greek is here for
Greek is to bring the light
Greek
Will bring you the light
Not me and my stupid ideas
I want to pause here
I'll let Amos say that when he comes
No, I'll say it for him
I want to recognize
I want you to recognize tonight
This is not for profit
I am not selling this
I have enough
Subscribers now
That I could sell this
Only I can't
Because the contract
Doesn't last
It's broken
The minute you make
Something from it
The minute you prostitute it
It loses its value
The minute you're doing it to keep your job
It loses its value
The devil was like
Don't do that, so look people
We are here, Hail Satan
We are here
Because of that principle
Do you know how novel that is?
Okay, let me just ask you this question
Those of you
Who don't know who you are
Because I know a lot of you are sitting there
I know who I am, this guy's
He's just playing philosophy
Okay, hang in there
Hang in there smarty
Let's see what happens
When your consciousness is cracked open
By the Greek
Let's see what happens
You run
Oh god, I lost it
Let's go to the next one
Look what that person did
Look at that first letter people
It's a mew
You hear that time I hit the accent
Me metikos
Not me metikos
Not me metikos
It's me metikos
And the Greek wants to
Accent itself on one of the last
Three syllables
The last three syllables
You're going to see that's where that hangs around
And originally that is pitch up
It's pitch up
It's very musical
Greek is very musical
