Boom, well me metik
Is to mirror
Is to mirror
And here's the word everybody thanks they know
But they do not, it's logos
It starts with a lambda
And what is the logos
The logos is your reckoning
Your calculation
I thought it was word
It is
Because a word
Is a reckoning
A
Reason
Give me a reason
And I've got
Logos
You see
Another thing you don't know
Is the word
Logos
Another thing you don't know
You're going to know now
Is that
The quantum
Reality
Is
The result
Of the logos
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Let's give you some pre-socratics
These are the people
You're going to sit in the future
You're going to sit with people
That you know you can't hold a candle to
That's what I love to bring the smarties in
Because in every class
There's going to be some smartie
Who thanks they know everything
And it's so beautiful to humble them
I used to spank seminarians
Mentally spank them
I love it
Don't challenge me
I'll spank you
Don't ask me to spank you
Okay, that's too much
Kinema
Kinema
Think of the word
Kinesthesia
Anything, any of the kin root
Right, it's the movement
Movement
Kinetic
Think of kinetic force
Hit the next one
Historia
Now you think you know what history is
This is where we get history and English
From
Historia
That's a question
What kind of question is it?
Originally it's a question that you propose
To an oracle
Imagine this
Imagine this
You're living in a world
Where
You recognize that you can put somebody
Into a death state
You can bring them out of it
And they can have experienced
Something
That will guide them
They will have an understanding
That is outside
Of time
And when you get that understanding
That's outside of time
You can pass that on
To other people
Who don't travel
And so they imagine
You live in that world
And you can go see one of these travelers
You can go see her
And you'll be like what?
She's a teenager?
Yeah
What do you think?
The most excellent vessel
For the god
To possess
You want the top
She's got to know everything
She's got to be the one who knew
That geometry
It's gorgeous
The poetess runs everything
Yes
She runs everything
Do you know what Historia means?
It means to ask the Oracle
A question
And when you go to the Oracle
What kind of question?
What do you think people go to ask them?
Do you think people go to ask them anything?
Where did I misplace my car keys?
Let me go to the Oracle
It's going to take me six days to get there
Yeah
No
You're going to that Oracle
That comes from being taken
Out
Of time
Out of
Chronos
That's who you are
When you are born again
You are taken from
Chronos
Now
Those of you who get the physics of that
Good for you nerds
Next one up
Theatron
The place of viewing
Where do you get vision?
You get vision in a theater
I went to New York
I lived in Bayonne
I went to New York
I took in
What is that?
It's a famous place
Made a big impression
Obviously
I took in stage
And I can tell you for a fact
I enjoyed it and I was entertained
But I was not inspired
Nor did I have vision
You got to remember
We're fumigating these people too
We're fumigating them
To induce these
Purgative
Visions
Jesus Christ
Is walking around with the same
Face paint
That the Balkans have
Yeah
Why?
Mystery operation
And that mystery is tied to drugs
Give me the next one
Boom
Paleosis, the sun, look at that
Ada that's on the front of that
Gorgeous, keep going
We've got to hurry up
These people came here for the reality
Zoe
Oh, that's life
And if you capitalize that
That's her
I just want you to stop for a second
Zoe
When I make that noise, Zoe
What is that?
That's life
That's life
And she
She is everything
Everything in the mystery
Revolves around
Zoe
Did you know
What the Septuagint
Calls Eve
Because Eve is not a name
Eve is a shout
It's a balkan cry
Her name was
Life
It's not interesting
It was only the devil
It was only the devil that gave her the fruit
It was only the devil
He's like, no
God's a liar
Love it, it's locked in the language
People, give me the next one
Hexagonos
Who wants a hexagon?
Oh, my God. Okay, next one
Look at these people, dimoniao
What does it mean to dimoniao?
You see the root demon on there
That we just looked at, right?
Dimoniao
It's a verb
That is, it's an action or a state of being
Dimoniao
I am going to wake up tomorrow
And dimoniao
Or maybe
If it goes down, I should dimoniao
It means
