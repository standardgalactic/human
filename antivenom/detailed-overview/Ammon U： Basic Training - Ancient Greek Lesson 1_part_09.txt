Yourself
I like that
Your own wits, right?
What they do in the Hebrew with this
What they do in the Hebrew with this
It's a huge concept, the frame is huge
What is this? To be mad
That's a little simple
That's a little simple and off
Technically, because look what kind of madness
They're doing, again, look at how
Third grade it is
Madman, behaving as a madman
Demented, driven mad
It's like clinical madness
It's like clinical madness
The only problem is
Both of those Greek words are associated
With mantic
Powers
What are mantic powers? The ability
You can take it out, the ability
To stand in the
Ion
To stand in the Ion
To see outside of
Time
Outside of time, give me the next one
What is something
That's monikos
It has
That
Mania, right?
That has to do
With inspiration
Right?
It has to do with inspiration
Look at the second
Roman numeral number two
Frenzied
And number two, frenzied, enthusiastic
Inspired
Right? Notice it's
Aristotle
It's philosophers
Defining
That's where we're getting these definitions from
A lot of it
And that's the beauty of
Alice's dad and what he did
And look at the bottom
Just for those of you who
Never believed me
When I tell you that
These things have to do with drugs
Look at number three at the bottom
It can cause madness
And we find that
In diascortes
Notice at the end
It's
Pharmaca
Let's see
The drugs
That induce a state
Where you are visionary
Visionary
And
Off your
Out of sync
Normal
Prophetic
Right? Do you see how many drugs there are?
I couldn't get through half of these definitions
Without a whole bunch of drugs in them
Okay, what are my instructions
Class-wise
For everybody here
You heard me pronounce all of those
I want you to learn the alphabet
That's all I want you to do
What? That's easy
No, it's not
You have to have it
At a point in your brain
Where you don't have to think about it
And that's important
Because you're going
To be working with letters
And you've got to know what the
Order of the alphabet is
So you can be looking words up
So you can be finding words
You're going to have to know
That order
It's very important
Please become intimate
Until next Wednesday
With that
Alphabet
Please be able to
Say it forwards
Be able to say it forwards
And there is a great key
In your text
There is a great key
In the front of the introduction
Right? Or unit one
Is it unit one? Sorry
Introduction
Of course it's the introduction
There's a great key in there
I want you to see
How the words are
How the letters are pronounced
When you put two vowels together
They form a different sound
Alpha
By itself is a
Yoda by itself is i
Put them together and they're not a
I
I
Okay
Good
By themselves Omicron
Upsilon
Is it
Do you hear the diagama
Just a little bit
Love it
Don't worry about the diagama
It's not in your textbook
I'm going to show it to you every once in a while
Creeps out every once in a while
If you will be done with the alphabet
Commit it and I know that doesn't sound like a lot
And people are going to tell me
I want to go faster
No, no, no
We can pile these on top of each other
But here starting off
I want you to take the time
To be able to recognize
All of those letters
That's all we're retuning
Retuning your letters
That's all
Please for the next week keep that up
And when we begin next week
I will know
That you will have read unit one
Today is different
Because we're doing introduction
When you read unit one
You'll find that there are
Exercises
At the end of the book not drills
I don't want you to do drills
I want you to do exercises
And if you do
Four, five, six
Exercises before coming
You'll be in good shape
If you don't do any
Come to next Wednesday's session
And you can advance yourself
Because what I will do
Is I will present all the grammar
And I will present some readings
And I will give you every time
Some drug, some kind of
Terrible act that involves
Some kind of forbidden
Fruit
Every time I'm going to give it to you
Okay, but in order to get there
We've got to go step by step
Please read unit one
For next week
And remember
You can
Find God
It's the drug
That's the God
Hail Satan
In the sky
The Irish witch can fly
Madea's got the heavy weight
How much you want to buy
Scorpion venom
Molecustaceans
Dragon venom vaping
You know they might be taping
They want the L-M-N-O-P's
For the darkest of dreams
Lady Madea
She's coming to see you
Go on challenge a train venom
High purple Vine 211
Glutia hit you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring you back from the dead
Go on challenge a train venom
High purple Vine 211
Glutia hit you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring you back from the dead
Lady Babylon
Word won the bid
It's how it is
With the poisonous kiss
She never miss
Catch you in the sacred drift
Catch you in the twist
Thanks for watching!
