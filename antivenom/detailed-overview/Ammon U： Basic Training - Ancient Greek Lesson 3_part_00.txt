Discretion
Athena Bella Seema
Do you like the hash?
I got the creeper reefer
We eat spaghetti for silly hours
Assassin
With the fruit and veggies out the corner
Corbina
Here, have a little taste
Sipping wine, iron flavor
I got the bag of amethyst
Don't bring up
Group cutter
New singer
Athena Lover
Got the lavender by the box full
Overrigga Tony coming through
High off the contact
It sounds nice
Fruits and labor all night
The moon rise
Dragon Queen taking flight
I spun away from the tree line
Hip-hop will make you feel fine
House of Frankenstein
Wolfman
Chimetime
Group cutter
Don't bring up
Phoenix Rising
That's how the devil rides
Don't bring up
Group cutter

Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is almond you tonight
And I'm gonna give you plenty of time
With your instructor tonight
I'm going to bring him on in a minute
But what I want to do is warm you up
And I want to say thank you for
Your continued attention to
Ancient Greek, it's very important
Very important
Eye-opening, enlightenment stuff
And tonight we're gonna do that
But in order to get there
We've got to start somewhere
That you're not gonna want to be
Where are we going?
We're going to the back alley
We're going to that place
Where people get seduced
They get seduced
Mmm
I want you, Satanic congregation
To be impervious
To the seduction of the fairy tale
I want you to be so rooted in reason
People have to give you a coat
Like a scientist
Call you Melvin
Listen to me very carefully tonight
We're gonna look at an example
Of how you can be taken into the back alley
It's very easy
And let's all stay together
Come on, let's don't get anybody
Get lost out there
This is a scary, scary place
Alright, I'm gonna hit you with the clip first
And I want you to look at this clip
And I want you as classical philologists
To realize your place is a place
Of examining evidence
You are investigators
You examine evidence
None of us care about arguments
Arguments are sold and bought
Evidence is what will take us to the history
So I want you to be listening for that
Go ahead
What did the Greeks want to do?
They wanted to destroy Judaism
That's why I say that when you think of Greek
Don't think of it as German
The reason why you would bristle the idea
That a holy book would be written in German
I don't need to tell you what happened 85 years ago
So Greek wasn't just another language
It was the enemy language
It represented everything that was vile
Everything that was ungodly
Moreover, bear in mind people may say
Well, the writers of the New Testament
They just were Greek speakers
Christians insist that the authors of the Gospels
And the letters the epistles found
In the Christian canon
Would divinely inspire
They're not just the recollections of evangelists
No, they were divinely inspired
By the Holy Spirit, by the Holy Ghost
Really, that means God inspired these people
To write in Greek
Did the Holy Spirit forget Hebrew and Aramaic
And there's a massive problem for the church
That's why there are books out
That when God began to speak Greek
They have to explain this away
It's a very big problem
Did the Holy Spirit speak Hebrew and Aramaic?
This is the difficulty
Do you hear how we're not looking at evidence, right?
We're scientists and we need to stand back
In order to understand history
We have to look at all the data that we've been given
That's history
And you and I are philologists
Our data is all that Greek
Now, the impression
This is the very...
This is the stealth
Of the whole creation of the fairy tale
People are speaking Hebrew and Aramaic
Fantastic, fantastic
I want you to keep that in mind
Because I'm going to show you something
We know that by this time
There was no spoken Hebrew
And I'll show you that in a second
So the Greek that is in antiquity
That is the language of literature
The Romans, you'd be proud of this
The Romans used to say the Greeks
Although they were conquered by us
They conquered us with that gorgeous, gorgeous hot language
It's right
So let's look for the data
Like in Hebrew, ancient Hebrew
There are only 8,000 unique words
In ancient Greek, somewhere around 1.5 million
Why the difference, right?
Chewie, hit us another star system, please
Yes, it's written in a language that's
Not just not Jewish, not Hebrew, not Aramaic
It's written in the enemy language
It's written in the ungodly language
The language of Hellenism
Everything that was ungodly
And most importantly
Most germane for us
Because you're a child of Hashem
You want to do the right thing
Like why are there these Greek ideas?
The idea of a demure
That Satan is the Lord of this world
In 2 Corinthians 4-4
It's the ideas that are conveyed in Christianity
That are Greek rather than Hebrew

Feel free
Now, the problem is
The things that we're not seeing
Is the very obvious
I want you to be on alert
Whenever someone starts talking
In generalities
Generalities don't stand up to
Even a decade of antiquity
You cannot say
These people do that at the same time
As those people do that
This is such a mixture of Mediterranean
And cultures from Asia Minor
Long, long, long histories
Languages galore
We're flooded with data
So we don't need to be making generalities
Be careful
When somebody says Bible times
Realize, oh, in Bible times
Something happens
Scientifically and linguistically absurd
It's absurd at its best
At its worst, it's intentionally deceptive
But it's something that monism does
Scholars hate this
And that's why classes don't treat the Bible
Because they know these are the guardians
Of the fairy tale
Are you ready for this?
I just want to hit you with a piece of
Get ready to reset yourself
And you're thanking
Are you ready? Let's just look at the facts
We're talking about Hebrew
In the first century
Let's see what we've got here
Give me the first facts
Watch this, people
You can find this on any old encyclopedia
What is Hebrew?
It's mostly related to Phoenician and Moabite
We don't have any more though
With which it is often placed by scholars
In the Canaanite subgroups spoken
In ancient times in Palestine
Now wait a minute, did you hear it
Start to creep in?
That was the creeper
In ancient times
What are you talking about?
There's 3,000 years of time
All over the western world
What are you talking about?
In ancient times
What happened?
