Spoken in ancient times
In Palestine, Hebrew was supplanted
Uh oh, what are they recognizing here?
They're recognizing that Hebrew died
Hebrew was a small tribal language that died
And by the time it got to the level
Of being able to communicate itself
Greek came along and went
Squash!
Just like she did
Many, many, many other languages
Many other languages
The real irony
Is that the person that was just speaking to you
About Hebrew and about evil Greek
Their ancestors
Were Greek speakers
That's the irony of the history
It died out
Watch what happens people
Hebrew was supplanted by
And they propose Aramaic
Possibly
Funny, aren't they?
Was there any Aramaic?
No!
What's going on?
We're trying to explain
The facts that we've got
And the monists have to stick to a narrative
They have to
If the Old Testament is not Hebrew
Everyone's in big trouble
And God has a birthday
God has a birthday
Hit it, Chewie
Yahoo! Yahoo!
When's your birthday?
Everybody!
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday, Elohim Hashem Jovah
It was in the third century
Thank you, occult examiner and Chewie
For bringing us that, Jim
Watch what happens, people
This is in the third century
Notice that they say it's in the third century, right?
That's when we know it's gone
It was revived
Look what they say
The language was liturgical
How many times have I told you that?
How many times have I told you that?
We're talking about a language that was dead
Do you know who's talking about that language that was dead?
People talking in Greek
Now, granted
At this time
At this time
The world is being swamped
Swamped by the language
But something is happening to Mother Greek too
She is aging
She's aging and that should not be happening
We have things creeping into the language
And ultimately, we get this thing called coine
It's a coine from the Attic dialect
And it is corrupted
It's corrupted
It's being dumbed down
Its commonality is having to pay
For absorbing people who have not worked with Greek
Who are not born with Greek
Yeah, all sorts of cultures
All over the Mediterranean
They're having to absorb this
You see, when you learn history, you learn dates
You learn people's names and that garbage is useless
It takes away from the focus of the nature
That the Greeks were so focused on
The nature of language
The nature of language
Give me the next one
We're talking about natural beauty here
Watch this, people
Here's another little entry
Classical Hebrew
The Hebrew language is divided into four major periods
Now watch this, pay attention
Biblical or classical Hebrew
What is wrong with the commas?
This person does not understand commas
Until about the third century BC
Now, they're telling you Biblical Hebrew
Is that which goes up to the third century BC
But wait a minute
How many biblical texts do we have from this period?
Do we have the letters of Isaiah?
No
Do we have the Genesis of Moses?
No
Do we have anything?
No
You mean we have nothing of Biblical Hebrew?
Zero
Do you know why this article says
That Biblical Hebrew exists
Without having any documents
Written in that language
Imagine if I were to say, you know what
In my backyard, some people spoke a language
And it was called blah
And blah was so expressive
Show us some blah
I got no blah
Fill in the blank, people
This is not science
You cannot say the period when this language was spoken
If there are no remains of the language
Zero
Zip
Nada
Now, watch what they say here in that line
Until about the third century
In which most of the Hebrew Bible is written
Really?
It's written in this period
Give me some of it
Oh, you don't have any of it
That right there that you just read
We just read together
That is an illusion
That's an illusion
We are song and dancers
Do you know what we are?
We are singers and dancers
And we are singing and dancing here
Let's keep going
Now, what comes after it?
After it comes Mishnehik or rabbinic Hebrew
And you say, aha, there's the language
I've got the language right there
And amen is a fool
Look, they're speaking Hebrew
Written about 200 CE
What?
This form of Hebrew, look what's in the parentheses
When somebody takes you into the back alley
And they start saying funny things
Look for what's in the parentheses
What's in the parentheses here?
This form of Hebrew was never used among people
As a spoken language
What are these people speaking?
Greek
Why did Jesus?
What did Jesus speak?
Nobody spoke Hebrew
It had been dead for years
It did not have the stamina
God's tongue took a dive
Yes
Watch what happens here, people
So, from about the 6th to the 13th century
When many words were being...
Look, what are they doing?
Borrowing
Now, we're going to try to bring it back
We've got to revive this corpse
And what are we going to do?
Naturally, we're just going to use the words
That we're speaking natively
Greek, Spanish, Arabic
I don't know if these are the languages
Of the ungodly
I don't know
But scientific, do you hear how that's an argument?
You don't want to be bathed in arguments
You want the evidence, the science
Anybody here? This is a friggin' temple
To reason
The muse, my friend
Is the result
Of a process of creation
Everything around you
Is that nature
Isn't that fundamentally
Kind of mind-altering?
If you can't follow anything but science
Wow, think about that
You could almost never
You could almost never be led astray
No, no
Facts won't lead you astray
Go to the next one
One more of these
I'm going to call on the drill instructor
Lots of good news from him
The Hebrew of the Bible exhibits
Little dialectical variety
Now, this one's important
It seems like it's a side note
So all of these books that are in the Bible
You mean they don't have any dialectical differences?
Period, as if the same person wrote them
Yeah
As if one person or one group of people
Wrote this work
All these different books, the books of Moses
The prophets, the Psalms
They're all written by the same people
By one group at one time
In the third century
They left their fingerprints all over it
And what language did they have to use?
They had to use Greek
They had to use Greek
Because that's all they had
You cannot write a work
If you're not native
If you don't have that language inside and out of you
Yeah, you can't use the idiom
The idiom stains you
Watch, I'm going to show you a little idiom here in a second
Give me the next comment
