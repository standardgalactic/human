This is fantastic
None of us is going to be deceived here anymore
None, no back alleys
We will stay
Tell me, teacher
We will stay the straight and narrow
Watch this, biblical Hebrew
In its widest sense, biblical Hebrew
First, the spoken language of ancient Israel
Furshing between 1000 BC
That's a nice, that's a right cap
Do we have a document from...
Of course we don't
1000 BC to 400 CE
It comprises several
Evolving and overlapping dialects
Look, it's almost like they don't have it
There's no scientific standards here
For their definitions
The phases of classical Hebrew are often named
After important literary works
Really, really
Like the Mishneh
Hebrew
Right?
A non-spoken language
Fantastic
Give me the next one
What is going on with this?
Israeli and Hebrew
Is it proposed?
Wait, is it proposed?
As soon as you hear proposed
That trench coat is coming off
Yeah, the trench coat
Look, you can expect it
Now you're in trouble
Don't be thinking, where's mom and dad?
No, you're done for
A proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew
Believed
Well, at least they're admitting
That this is not a matter of science
But a matter of faith
At least they're admitting that
Believed to have existed in all eras
Of the language
In some cases competing with it
Look at how incredibly contorted
And detailed is their belief
Right?
Seriously, is this the best your scholars can do?
Yes, yes
One for the scholars
One for the scholars
All you language scholars
You lazy people
Shame on you
Shame on you for abandoning the art
Go to the next one, Shuey
Quickly, quickly
I want to bring the sergeant
And here we go
One more
Look at this
Israeli and Hebrew, IH
Is a northern dialect
Now this one didn't say that
They don't have any of this
This fish doesn't exist
This is a hypothesized fish
Have you seen it?
Have you drawn it out?
Do you know where it has its young?
What does it do?
What environment?
No, no, no, no, that
This is an imaginary fish
This is an imaginary fish
Blow it up, Chewie
Blow it up
Proposed
Well, there, finally
Proposed as an explanation
For the various irregular linguistic features
Of the Maseridic texts
Now what are they talking about?
When you read the Bible
You are reading an English translation
Or a Spanish translation
You're reading a translation
Of the Maseridic text
And when is the Maseridic Hebrew text?
When is it invented?
It is invented in 1000
On Odomany
You mean we're not even a thousand
We're a thousand years off the mark
Yes, you meant to land
In the Sea of Tranquility
You landed on Mercury
Oh my God
My God
Biblical scholars, what is wrong with you?
Watch what happens
It competes with the alternative
Oh look, the irregular linguistic features
So we have the Maseridic text
But it's irregular
Why do you think they have problems?
You don't hear classes is talking about
You know what?
Homer, hey guys, irregular
No, no, no, no, don't play games
What's happening with your text, people?
It's falling apart
It competes with the alternative explanation
That such features are Aramaisms
Now look what they did
They so want to include something
That sounds legitimate
They're gonna pull an Aramaic
Aramaic is that substitute for reality
The reality that we need to understand
Is this stuff didn't exist in antiquity?
Do you know what was there?
Greek
And she was eating everybody up
The good news is that after Greek
Met its decline
Into the influences of the first
And centuries BC and AD
After she started to meet her client
A group of very enthusiastic people
You could call them, I don't know
A Satanic congregation
They came up
They came up with a method
They said we're gonna re-inject
The glory that was Athens
Do you remember all the evil things
That Hellenism is doing?
Like democracy?
Do you remember the real evil thing
That Hellenism gave birth to
In our history?
It's called democracy
Democracy
That comes through a language
And that language has the capacity
To make you aware
Do you know the science that the Greek teaches?
That science can put anybody
Anybody who's trying to take you into a back alley
Put it to shame
Put some to shame
Lady Justice is right there with her
Let's go to the next one
Watch this people
And then I'm just waiting
I'm gonna call on the drill and strike
10 minutes and I'm calling you
This is a Greek sentence
Lifted from Deuteronomy 7
Deuteronomy 7 too
And to make you aware
That Hellenism is
That Hellenism is
That Taxes
Now watch this on the second line
Hellenism is
Do you hear that?
Do you see what they're doing?
Now watch, he's gonna do it again
Do you hear what's going on?
It's something
Hellenistic grace particularly love to do
They love to take a verb
Because they're smarties, right?
They've learned how the language works
They've learned the mastery of how that causes you to grow
In your frame
In that place that you perceive
Causes you to grow
And you know they've gotten clever
And here's what we're gonna do
We're gonna take a verb
The action word
And we're gonna take a noun
The person, place, or thing
And we're gonna take those two things
The word, the verb, and it's gonna have this root
And then we're gonna take the same root
And we're gonna have the noun
Use the noun from that root
Right?
It's a little bit of repetition
That breaks up
It makes them remember this is musical
Right?
Lots and lots of non-musical languages out there
Lots of them
Like our stupid Anglo-Saxon
Right?
Speaking of Anglo-Saxons
Check out
Old Boy
Who is doing an outstanding service
By running around
Tracking down
Tracking down the purple
In his backyard
And going to some of these places
And talking
He was talking to someone
I'll give you a little bit of preview
I don't think he'd mind
Old Boy's gonna be looking at more purple
That they're still finding
Oh God
It's wonderful people
Who said the apocalypse
Who was that person
Who said this was gonna be impossible
To you
Naysayers
