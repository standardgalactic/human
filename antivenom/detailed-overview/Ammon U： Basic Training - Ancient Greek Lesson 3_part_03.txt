Let's go back to that verse
Let's go back to that verse
What does this verse say?
It brings up something
That I wanted to show you
The style
The style of this line
These lines
Is Greek
It's not only colloquial
It's cyan
It's stylistically Greek
Is the Hebrew able to keep this up?
No, of course not
Because the Hebrew is a translation of this
How are they supposed to invent words?
Oh God
If you've only got 8,000
You've gotta start inventing
It's the way it is
We do the same thing in English
Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors
They did the same thing
You borrow
Remember the Hebrew that we're talking about
In the Middle Ages
That they're trying to revive this dead corpse
What are they doing?
They're taking Greek
They're taking Spanish
They're pulling it all in
They're taking German
Right
Right, and by the way
By the way
You know what?
Let's stay above the Frey people
Let's keep ourselves
Let's keep ourselves in the dignified zone
I think we'd all like that
I think we'd all like that
Give me the next one
We're gonna fly through a couple of these
I just wanted you to see
Here's that Afanismos
And I want you to see
We've got a little bit of creepage in our definition
Because remember
The editors
There's a whole bunch of editors
To the Oxford Greek lexicon
And they will group
They will do something
That you saw that guest
Our guest speaker today
That you saw him doing
There is a difference
What they do is they say
Look, they're a monist
And then there is the culture
In which monists live
And the monism
Creates this barrier
Where you don't know what your neighbor is doing
You know, speak his language
You don't use his toothpaste
You don't do anything like that
Right?
That never exists
It's an impossibility
It's like living in a bubble
Nobody lives in a bubble
You're stained with everything around you
Everything around you
And so it's creeping in
In Section A with the word extermination
Right?
What is affanizo in Greek?
It means to destroy
To obliterate
To wipe
To take away entirely
Right?
Show me the verb, Chewie
It's next
When you think
Wait a minute
Isn't that the same thing as extermination?
No, it's not
Watch
To do away with
To remove
Right?
Something that is concealed
Something that is concealed
Right?
To secret away
Or steal something
To obscure
Do you hear where affanizo is going?
Right?
It has to do
With whether or not you can see it
It's ah, the alpha-privilege
Plus faan
The base that means to appear
So it's not appearing
Fantastic
Give me the next one
How does this stuff get translated?
On the Hebrew side
Go to this one
How does this stuff get translated?
Go down here
On the Hebrew side
Let's just jump to it
Haram
To ban
To devote
To exterminate
What is the concept here?
Do you want to know
What is uniquely
Hebrew?
If you do, it's really, you know, it's fascinating
Because they left us the Septuagint
And then attempted to translate it
It's very interesting that you can pick out
You can filter out the cultural influences from the Hebrew
This word, haram, is very specific
In context all the time
And it means to take a group of people
And wipe them out
To take a group of people
And dedicate them to your God of death
Wait a minute
What?
Check this out
Check this out
I know, we don't get the concept in Greek
We're trying to creep
Afanesimus toured it
But we can't quite get there
Right?
Because that evil language of Hellenism
That evil language of Hellenism was sitting
Saying, hey, look at democracy, brah
Lots of different people
There are no races
There's only two types of people
And we'll say the Greeks
Which Greeks?
The Athenians
Do you know what they said?
When the language was at its peak
Do you know what they said?
It's not about races
It's about your language
There are those of us who know Mother Greek
And those of us who don't
And those who don't speak like
No music in them whatsoever
You want to be one of those people
You want to be one of those Anglo-Saxons
You want to be one of those Oscans
You want to be a Roman with your Latin
All right, let's go
Next one down
I think it's time for me to call in
Calling the sergeant
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Because what do we do?
Oh, I just wanted you to see
We've got extremities of age here
And we're always talking about that
Nakey kid with Jesus
He was a Neoniskos
Well, we've got the young and the old
We've got the extremes
Who are the people that we kill?
Who are the people that we perform
Complete and total genocide upon
In antiquity
Who are these people that we do this to?
Those who are outside of the monest box
Right, and who do we kill?
The young, from the youngest to the oldest
Men and women
And what else?
Even their cattle
Their calves
Those animals they use that come under the yoke
You know what I'm talking about
Those works, those work animals
Kill them all
What are you going to kill them with?
You're going to kill them with the edge of the sword
What about the gold?
The gold?
You dedicate to the service of God
This concept is not Hellenistic
It is not
Why?
Because Mother Greek embraces everyone
Yeah, they were giving themselves over
People were giving themselves over
Fantastic, amazing
Let me call in, I think that's it
We got one more, one more Chewie
And then we're going to bring in the drill sergeant people
And he will answer all of your questions
And guide you
Take you exactly where you need to be
Please listen to him
At that time we took all the towns
Completely, I think this is Jesus speaking
No, not the one you're thinking of
But the one you call, what do you call Jesus?
Oh, Joshua
Yeah, that's right
The men, women, children
Nothing, give me the next one
Nothing left
We kill them all
That's the way, go
This is the concept
