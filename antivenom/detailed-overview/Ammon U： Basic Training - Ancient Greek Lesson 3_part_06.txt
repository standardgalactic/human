What is the difference
Between reckoning and doing?
Is there some sort of magic
Physics going on
Between reckoning or reasoning

Is there a difference
Between action and being?
Linguistically, the grammarians
Are quick to point out
That this is just the difference
Between a verb and a noun
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It can do two things, right?
It can be
Or it can do
Ergon, logos
Ergon, logos

By the ergon or the logos
Okay, trust me
By the time you're done
When somebody says
In the beginning was the word
Your mind will go back
To the native of the time
That they wrote it
This is the power of the words
That they have for you
You're sitting there
Do you want this capacity?
Do you want this capacity
To do this and do exactly
Exactly what I say
Hit me with the next one
Look at that, wait a minute
There's two definite articles here

Intensive course
It's introductory
You'll find out when you get in the bush
This is just to train you
So you can go out into the bush
And when you're out there in the bush
You're gonna find that
Not everything holds together
We're gonna study 2,000 years
In Greek
And things change
And you gotta know
In early Greek
In Archaic
Homeric Greek
And I'm not talking about
A proposed language
Because we have it
It survives
Because it dominated
The mind
The Bacchic Empire
The mind was everything
And there was no language
Not even Latin
Could stand it
The Romans walking around saying
We conquered them
And they came back with that language
And they conquered us
The power of Greek
Do you know what you do to your enemies
When all you've got is arguments?
You demonize them
There is a movement of people
Who will meet the exception
Of the science and they will demonize it
Happens all the time
It's the natural kinetics of the universe
You know what I'm saying
You're sitting there
And you know what I'm saying
Did my tiny little brain
Did my tiny peat...
Oh God, it's so average
My brain is so average
Was it able to get to these places
Without mother Greek?
Uh-uh
Right?
Special operations soldiers
Right?
They have it inside them
Those guys, their instructors
They just bring it out
They just bring it out
Know yourself
You know who knows who they are?
Somebody who's brought it out
And the dope that I'm giving you
Will cause you to bring it out
Love it
Do you need to be smart?
If you did, I wouldn't be here
Okay?
I'm just telling you that
All honesty
Yeah, fantastic
It's humbling
Working with the muses is humbling
Because people want to give you credit
And they want to tell you
Oh my God, this is James
This thing, what are you saying?
All I'm giving you are her songs
That's all
I'm just giving her songs
Love it

Can be masculine or feminine
You mean, wait a minute
Wait a minute
This language, this evil language
Of the Greek
Is able to envision
Female divinity
Now I know all the monists just laughed
I know they just laughed
The idea of a female divinity
Right, because monism is atheism
Is atheism
DK is a woman
And if you haven't learned that DK is a woman
That justice is a woman
Maybe Julian was right
Maybe the emperor Julian was right
The monist will destroy your very language
Set up a fairy tale
A fairy tale
Why did you see the merch?
It's all about merch
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Do you know who said that?
The Furies
The Greek Furies
Speaking Hellenistic Greek
They said, hey, you
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
What do we want, people?
We're not here because we want the fairy tale
We're here because we want the reasoned logos
We're here because we want reality
Now, give me the next one
Faith, do you know what faith is good for?

What you're perceiving
Don't trust your frame

Everything
The whole thing is a foundation
It's got one foundation
And that foundation is use your mind
Use it
The serpent was the wisest of all creatures
Okay
Here's three more nouns, right?
What am I doing, people?
I'm getting you used to the lettering
Make love to this
Techne, technes, right?
Techne, it's skill, it's skill
These are all feminine, by the way
Hora, that's the countryside
Let's go out to the Hora
And we can energize her
What is it called, that thing inside of you?
I don't know, is it here, is it here?
It's kind of here, right?
Don't think, I don't know, maybe too much up there
Psyche, soul
Where is your soul?
It's in your thumos
It's in your thumos, how do you know?
When you're dead, you breathe out your soul
And if you are over the person dying
You can breathe it in
You can breathe it in
Isn't that a gorgeous thought?
Isn't that a gorgeous thought?
Psyche
Do you know who fell in love with your soul?
Psyche
