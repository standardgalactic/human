And he's got arrows
And he shoots those into Psyche
What I am telling you is a mystery
It's the mystery of the Donbringer
It's the mystery of Eros
Eros
Now, if you're an atheist
And you don't worship Eros
I am sorry for your spouse
I am sorry
Ladies of frustration, please
Hang in there
Salvation is coming
Let's go to the next one
What else do we have? Give it to them
They've got to love this stuff
Give it to them, I'm going to give it
It's going to be right down the chute
Give it to me, next one
A couple of verbs
Remember this chapter we're focusing really on nouns
We're going to have verbs next to units
Because verbs are the big machines
They're the big machines of the language
So for right now, we're hitting you with the verbs
I'm going with the nouns
We're going to hit you with adjectives as well
Don't worry, we'll get there
Here are two verbs
Paidewe
Look at how I'm pronouncing it
Paidewe
You hear my digama coming out of the Upsilon?
Paidewe
It means to teach
Please
Somebody, look at the root Paide
P, Alpha, E, Yoda, Delta
By the way, somebody asked the question
I saw this in the correspondence somewhere
What's another primer that I should get?
If you get another primer, get out!
Do not get any other tool
Stay on this course
I can promise you
All they do, and I say that seriously
All that does is cause confusion
I have to undo, for example
What books like...
I've got one right here
Reading Koine Greek
That thing is so bad
It is so bad if somebody's been in that text
I have to undo the damage
That was done to them
Granted, they're always thankful
And it's usually seminarians
They're always thankful
But it's a damaging process, people
I want you to stick with our text
Please, stick with our intensive Greek
By Hanson and Quinn
Here, give me that chewy
Stick with our intensive Greek
Intensive course
You got it, people
And people, please
Do not, do not buy the chemical muse
Somebody sent me an email
It's $2,000
I have not made anything from that
And I will not make anything from that
I won't
All you're doing
Is you are wasting your resources
I don't want to take away food from your family
Right?
Get clever
Find it
There are ways
That's fantastic if you do
Find it
You'll know how to find it
My God, man, hoist a flag
With skull and bones on that thing
And find it
You mean you're undercutting yourself
I can't tell you how many people don't understand
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Have you ever seen me advertise anything?
Do you see a poster of my book?
Do you see it?
You don't
And you never will
And why is that?
Because the devil told me
You'd be one of those back alleys
You'd be one of those back alley blanks
I can't say it on YouTube
And you know what I'm going to do to you
And then he went through a list of things
A litany
A litany
Most of them had to do with parts of me
That I don't want to expose
Money
Greed
Your greed
Says that wing of gorgeous devil
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Do you know where?
Now remember, this is a great concept
And I want you to be absorbing these great concepts
Aros is a purifier
Do you know what you cannot do?
You cannot offer a lover
Cash
And buy their love
You can't do it
The one who is in love
Will cross oceans
Will suffer disease
Will do everything in the world
For that love
That's Aros
You can't buy Aros
You can't buy Aros
Do you know what is not classical?
You know what is not classical?
Greed
It's constantly
And Jesus came along and he said
It was the root of all evil
He said the love
That desire for profit
In Greek the word is the desire for profit
It's translated as the love of money
It's not
It's the drive for profit
For making profit
Making over what you need to survive
Is called greed
And what happens?
The muse doesn't like greed
Hates greed
Evaporates in the presence of greed
It's a part of the pact with the devil people
We need this esoteric knowledge
And in order to acquire it
You gotta purge your greed
Purge your greed
That is one of the evil ideas
Of Hellenism
That is one of the ideas
It's not the idea of annihilation
And extermination
It is the idea that greed
Is a destroyer of democracy
Isn't that gorgeous?
You wanna rule yourselves?
Get rid of your greed
Love it
Love it so much
Yeah throw your money like that
Throw your money in there
Right, see what I mean? Jesus
Oh, soul sucker
Now come on
Come on
In all fairness
Soul sucking has gotten a black eye
Yeah definitely
It's definitely gotten a black eye
Karl Marx spoke ancient
No, stop it purple
Stop it, I'm glad you brought up this point
Karl Marx did not speak ancient Greek
Karl Marx was a classicist
He studied and translated ancient Greek
Yeah, that's what we have to do
We're not here to speak ancient Greek
Because when you say he spoke ancient Greek
What you're doing is you're making ancient Greek
A modern Greek
You're making it a language that is a spoken language
You're making it an active process
And that is not how you learn
A language that is no longer an active language
You have to draw that distinction
You don't go in learning to speak it
You go in learning to translate it
Your mind crawls into bed with these gorgeous concepts
Now purple, I know where you were going
Karl Marx, what's that way?
What is that? Does anybody know what that means?
I don't know what that means
Yeah, I'm French
Very good, that's okay
Look at this, by the way
Good, good
The French, oh god
Oh god, thank you for joining us
Your unique courage
Your old Celtic courage
Yeah, love it, and by the way
Total devotees of Eros
Total kudos, kudos
To all the French kudos
You know what, I was just south of Dijon
And French purple will be able to tell you
Oh god, he's in that gorgeous country of the vine
Who do you think Bacchus passed on
All of his knowledge to
It's buried in the French countryside in those vines
Those California vines have nothing
On those French vines
I stood with a Frenchman, his wine
He was dressed and he's got his big boots on
He's dressed with overalls, he's working
He's doing his vineyarding
And he says, hey try this, try this lovely
And it was like metallic mushroom dirt
It felt like I was being energized by some kind of
Maternal, maternal sauce of the cosmos
