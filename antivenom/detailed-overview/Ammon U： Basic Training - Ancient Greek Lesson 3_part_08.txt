Oh god, no, don't underestimate
The classical wisdom that lies buried in French culture
It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous
It makes me envious
And thank you purple, good comment
Go to the next one, I want to keep us on task here tonight
Watch people, here's a couple of sentences
Now, we've learned nouns
And I threw up a couple of verbs there
Now we're just going to put it together
And I want to show you how to do this
The first word, ho, there's your definite article
The homeros, that's our word, homer
Ho homeros, homer, homer what?
Jump all the way to the end
There's the verb, paidewe
Homer teaches ton antropon, the man
Homer teaches the person
Look at me, I did it
Oh, you're not supposed to do that
Ah, you love it, you love it
Homer teaches the person
Watch, now how do I know this isn't the person
Who teaches Homer?
Because Homer is in the nominative case
With that ending, os, it's the nominative case
He's got to be the subject
Ton antropon is in the accusative case
How did I know that?
If I knew my definite articles
It would be obvious
We've got to know our definite articles then, right?
That's just the next thing we've got to do
So Homer teaches the man
Homero, homero, antropon paidewe
What about the one underneath that?
Now watch what happens to Homer
Ho homeru
Ho homeru
Look, it switches ending from a nominative to a genitive
And what is the ho going with it?
The ho is a nominative case as well
So it can't be accompanying the homeru
Because that's genitive, it would have to be two
So what is the ho accompanying?
It's accompanying Adelfos
The brother homeru of Homer
Do you remember how I want you to translate genitives?
Of somebody, it's possession
Of somebody
So the subject is Adelfos
Brother homeru is in the genitive case
Of Homer
The brother of Homer
What does the brother of Homer do?
Paidewe
He educates
Who's he educating?
Ton antropon
Nice accusative case there
You see the accusative ton antropon
With that on ending on the end of it
Good, it's an accusative case
It's the object of the verb
Alright, look, that's all you need to be knowing
Now what am I doing to you that you don't realize it?
I'm cramming
I'm super or hyper exposing you to the Greek
You're being forced to follow it
Well, there's 80% of you out there
Who are started from ground zero
Are now saying, oh, I'm just beginning
I can kind of follow the word
I can kind of follow the letters here all put together
Right?
We're running, and you're running with me
That's all we're doing
Give me the next one
Another two sentences here
Look at this
Ton homeron paidewe ho antropos
Now, wait a minute
Where is the nominative?
Where's the nominative case?
It's ho antropos
You mean the subject is at the end of the sentence?
Yes, don't let your English mind
Try to work itself out
Because we don't put subjects at the end
We do subject verb, direct object
That's how we do English
Right?
Greek
Greek doesn't care about word order
Word order is four barbarians
Word order is four barbarians
You know what the Greeks can do?
They can take 45 words and throw them up in the air
You tell me what that means
Well, there's no order to it
Yeah, there doesn't need to be an order
The endings of the words will tell you
What they're doing in the sentence
So the subject here is at the end of the sentence
Ho antropos
The person
The person does what paidewe
Teaches
Ton homeron
It's an accusative
So it's the thing
It's the thing person or place
That's being taught
That's being acted upon by the verb
The person teaches Homer
What does the bottom line say?
Homeros tus antropos paidewe
Where's your subject?
Homeros
It's got that os, nominative ending
Where's your direct object?
Tus antropos
That's what we're going to be acting on
Is the men
Notice they're in the plural now
Plural
We've got singular and plural nouns
Dog or dogs
Singular and plural
And so how would you translate this?
Sentence Homer teaches the people
Homer teaches the people
Okay, now you can go back over these examples
And if you do
Just these last 10 minutes
Of what we've been working on
If you do
What I want you to do
Is I want your eyes to track the text
I want your eyes to be able to read it
Ton homedon
Even if you don't understand it
Because really what's going on with you
You're just learning the alphabet
You're just at that stage
Where you're learning alphabet again
With delta
That's it
And that's what we're trying to do
We're trying to reset your mind
With the Greek letters
Look at how beautiful these things are
If I didn't tell you before
These are superior to English
The English alphabet
The Latin alphabet
That's because I was derelict in my duty
Look at the musicality of this language
Look at that P
What does that P make you want to do
On the front of Pidewe
It makes me, I don't know
It does something inside of me
With the curves
Look at the curves on that
Look at how the top
Just kind of coalesces
It kind of just becomes part of the two
It's like a bridge Pidewe
It's gorgeous
I kind of like the Omega too
The Omega
Look at the Omega on Anthropos
Excuse me, on Anthropos
On the end of the first line
Look at that Omega
Do you see how curvaceous that Omega is?
That's musical, baby
That's musical right there
Oh, God
Yeah, love it
Okay, let's stop
Let's stop with that
Give me another one
Look, now we're going to get a little more complicated
With this first sentence
I just want to illustrate one thing
Look at that third word
Bibliois
Finally, we get a dative case
We've had nominative as a subject
Genitive as possession or of
I want you to translate it of something
Of Homer
Then we've had the accusative
That's the fourth one
And it's always a direct object
The one we're leaving on is dative
The dative
And what do you do with the dative?
It's the indirect object
Well, what does that mean, Maynard?
Let me tell you what it means
You're going to translate it as to, for, or with
You're going to try it every time
You know what this sentence says
With to, for, or with?
Homer teaches his brother the art
With books
You hear that? With books
What is a dative?
It's a dative of instrument or means
It's a dative of something that gives you
The capacity to do something
Do you need to remember that when you're translating?
Yeah, you do
But what do you really need to know?
What's the cheat?
Just translate those datives as to, for, or with
When you're starting out like this
To, for, or with
The dative is something beautiful
Dative is something beautiful
And it's got this yoda in it
Homer teaches his brother the skill
By means of books
