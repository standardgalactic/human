Back Alley Extraction
Hit you with a ticket, hands nodding
Open chemists to the moon, the language of the birds
Death above a pure, wild stallion crew
Rolling in a main, magic gin, 60 pound of green
Diamond shining, I'm in this thing
Cornstone ring, bling and bling
Hot purple lean, venomous cream
Silver seven seas, hot fire
Gasoline, dance with the muse
Athena, metadata, flying in your dreamer
Doom gate keeper, blaze the ganja greener
Greek fire keeper, ome sima sima
Maduro riding with me, my girls with it
Dragon poison, every rose has its thorn
White snake, obvious
Hot fire Gasoline, Medea, Medesina
Hot fire Gasoline, and Satan come to see ya
Hot fire Gasoline, Medea, Medesina
Hot fire Gasoline, and Satan come to see ya
It's a little field trip, and it's going to be a lot of fun
And I think it's an honor
I think it's an honor here at OmenU
To be able to talk to the people that we're going to talk to tonight
Tonight we're going to have a conversation with all boy here
And he's going to tell us what he's doing
And he's going to tell us about the Greek that he has worked through
Fantastic, I love it, I love it, I really do
First I want to talk to you about something new
We are going to have Experiment Alpha
Take place this Friday evening
This Friday evening's Lady Babylon will be Experiment Alpha
And what we are going to do is we are going to examine a patient
We'll call him Patient One
And he has been inoculated
He's been inoculated and what we're doing is we're subjecting him to the Holy Spirit
We're subjecting him to the Christ
And we're going to see if the inoculation was strong enough
So that we can cure humanity
Isn't that great? Isn't that great? You love it
Now, I will tell you
This person who is coming on is not somebody that I have had on before
And I think you will all be extremely pleased at his presence
So that's coming Friday
Tonight what we're going to do is first we're going to look at a person who has gone through intensive Greek
And is now putting together all sorts of great, great, great, great stuff
Tracking down, this gent is tracking down the purple in his homeland
Across the pond, fantastic, let's bring him on
Bring on old boy, old boy, thank you so much for coming
Would you please formally introduce, I know a lot of the Lady Babylon folks already know you
But give yourself an introduction that you want to give the world
And you won't be interrupted by any commercials or anything like that
Go for it
Well, thanks for having me here first off
It's great to be able to speak to everybody
And basically I've been through the intensive course under Amon
And it's been such a great experience
I think we've been studying around about just under a year and a half
And going from not even being able to read the letters to now being able to go
And research texts and start translating sections of them and presenting them
It's been a liberating experience
Thank you for the time that you put in to taking me through that process
It's been a great job that you've done, right?
You marched through the basic training
And now you're working with the text and I saw one of your videos the other day
One of your videos the other day and it was gorgeous
You broke down, you quoted the Greek, I was like this giant nerd, I love it
And so that drew you to the purple
Tell us a little bit about your purple quest
So as you know, they found a chunk of the purple at the excavation of a bath house
It was very close to where I lived and grew up
So I thought, you know what, I'll get in touch with them
I'll see if I can go down there, get on site
Put together a little short documentary and they got back to me and said, yeah, that's going to be cool
So, you know, that was arranged
And then I thought, well, why not piece together a mini series looking at texts that mentioned the origin of it
The medical applications of it, you know, and then the cult uses as well
And then I thought, you know, I can just translate some chunks of texts and piece them together with some scenery
Nearby where I live and just present them
And as well, it's good for me because it gets me diving into those texts
It keeps me reading every day because as you know, it's something you need to be doing every day
Because it does slip out of the brain and it keeps me focused
It keeps me going and it keeps me looking at Greek texts
So it's a win-win all around
Yeah, what you hear is discipline
Right, everybody's watching on you tonight who's got your book
This is discipline that old boy is exhibiting here
This is an example to follow
Now, he's running down archaeologists, can you believe that?
Running down archaeologists and talking to them about it
They told you they found some more, didn't they?
Yeah, that's right
So that hasn't, you know, hit the major or anything yet
So it was Frank Jekko who's the person overseeing the dig
I managed to get a short five-minute interview with him
And I said I was obviously interested in it and he kind of had a little smile
And he went, we found another piece, you know, so
Yeah, I was very excited to get that news and share it with you all
So yeah, they found another piece
Look at that, look at that, a scoop!
A scoop, you got the story there and you know what?
I'm sure he'd love talking with you
I'm sure it was like, you know, something neat, you know what I mean?
Because somebody here you are and you're interested
And you've got the background to be able to work with the texts and stuff
Wow, that's impressive
Isn't it liberating old boy when you can actually work with those primary texts yourself?
Yeah, it's absolutely incredible
You know, when I was first getting interested in this kind of stuff
I would be researching, trying to compile texts
Some of it would be in Latin, some of it would be in Greek
And you're there going, I just wish I knew what it said
And now that I've been through that process
You know, I can just get a piece of text
I can be there with the text, Alexicon, using Alice
And then I can work through a translation
Yeah, good, and you've got your smith grammar
In case anything gets funny out in the bush
Tell us, oh look at that
Tell us, where do you go from here?
I know that you're interested in some things like Gaelic
Or like you were going to go up north maybe and study some
Oh, what were you into? It was that Norse, right?
Norse, tell us, what is the future?
And how do you see using your classical studies?
Well, obviously family life was a little bit hectic
It's quieting down a bit now
And I can focus on moving forward with the Greek
I still do want to pursue the runology
That is an interest of mine
I'm always tracing down the origin of where these runic scripts came from
Right now, I just want to be able to look at texts
And just, I think it's a nice little package
That I've found that I can deliver to people
Where I can translate a text, go around some scenery
Because I've got some amazing historical sites on my doorstep
And I can join the two together and just present them
So, I'm happy doing that
And that's what excites me
And as I said, it keeps me reading the Greek
And that's something I want to develop to the next level
I love that, I absolutely love that
And I know you're going to end up integrating a whole bunch of different stuff
And you're going to end up being one of those polyglots
And, you know, more power to you
You know, that's inside of some people
They don't realize it's in there
Maybe you've got a little inclination along the way somewhere
But man, that language work just brings out the beauty
Fantastic, so we should all check out Old Boy
And, you know, support him as somebody who's coming forward
And picking up those sources, right?
You could be getting in the back alley with, you know who?
You know what I mean?
You're not going to get that
You're not going to get that back alley with Old Boy
He's going to give you the stuff, baby
And look at him, you know what?
He doesn't have to defend his professor's position
And be careful about what he says
The dude is into the text and the reality
That's what I like
And Old Boy, you were an excellent, excellent student
And everybody here should look up to you
Thank you
Right?
Yeah
Give everybody a final say what's on your mind
And we'll let you go
All I would say is, you know, have faith in the book
The Hanson and Quinn's an incredible resource
You know, mine is literally still bookmarked
You know, I still refer back to it all the time
I use that in conjunction with the Smythe Greek grammar
And obviously Alice
And just trust the process
Identify your verbs first
That's all I do when I go into a text
I just identify everything and then work from there
As long as you identify everything
That's a great starting point to start from
So, you know, stick with it
It's worth it
It'll change your life and it'll change your mind
So, yeah, thanks guys
We would probably get a full class
If I were in the position to be able to bring a summer intensive course
I would have you be one of the chief instructors, drill instructors
Fabulous job
Everybody, big round of applause for Old Boy
Look at the respect, you know, feel it
Yeah, I love it, Old Boy
I'm gonna keep checking out your work
Get out of here and thank you for coming
Thanks so much, thank you, take care
All right, let's get back to the textory
Now, a lot of you here tonight
And by the way, Old Boy is genuine, baby
He is totally genuine
So, yeah, life is good sometimes
You know what I mean? Old Boy brings it out
Anywho, let's get things going
Because you feel it, you're like, yeah, I got the mojo too
Let's keep going
You have all come tonight
We have to do this specially
People here, you've come to a place before you were here
And in that place, I know, I sensed it
I smelled in that place the unholy treatment
Of the religious studies scholars of the masses
I felt it, it's like a disturbance in my chest
I can't describe it except to say that it smells a little bit like a fart
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing
Let us go and let us purge from ourselves
The probabilities and the ideas and the theories
And my ideas this and my ideas
