We are not here for that, you are not here for that
I am not here to give you some kind of back alley
Fun time, that's not what my job is
Right from the devil's mouth
My job is to bring you the light
To bring you the Greek
So that you can take that Greek and forge an instrument of attack
This is so that we can take back those texts
This is our life heritage
The words of our dead ancestors
What more holy is there for us to protect than those words
Yes, let's jump into it
So we will clean off the muck because I can smell it
I can smell the...
Oh God, I know where you went
I know where you went
Now for those of you who are like
What is this guy talking about?
You weren't there, okay?
So just part of the congregation must purge
We must purge
Let's go and we will purge with reason
And with accurate linguistics
With evidence, that's how we will purge
Because you don't care about my ideas
And that's why I'm not trying to sell you anything
You don't have to be a member here
You can walk in the door and listen
This is fantastic
Welcome to the mission of Lucifer
This is wonderful
After this everybody gets to eat
And you don't realize that their food is drugged
But you're gonna do it anyway
It's all in your head
Let's go to the text tonight
Oh, thanks everyone
Yes, all boys
All right, fantastic
All comments of compliments toward all boys
Just put them in the chat there
Fantastic
I want to bring you something tonight right off the bat
And I'm just gonna translate
And after this I saw four angels standing
On the four gonias of the earth
Wait a minute
On the four what?
And what are these angels doing?
They are guarding the winds
And what, wait a minute
Am I in the book of Revelation?
This stuff is so psychedelic
Did we already get hit by the angel?
Did somebody come in and give us our...
Did we get it?
We got the right...
It's why everything is purple
Okay, good
So here we are flying right
At the four gonias
What is that?
You can translate that as corners
The four corners
Here's where I want you mentally
Think of the four corners
We're in the right
And the angelos, the messenger
Is giving us the mystery
And the mystery starts with the restraint of the winds
And if you are living in antiquity
And you are reading Greek
You know the science behind the winds
What are you?
Ignorant?
My God
Let's show you, right?
What does he say?
He's doing all this
What are the angels doing?
They're restricting that onimus
And they're keeping it from the sea
And the land
It's not going to be whistling through the trees
Give me the next one
What are we doing?
What are we doing, people?
Medea
The architect of the first mystery
In western history
Medea is the one who created a right
Whereby you could transit this life-death barrier
And in that right is this science of the winds
Medea wrote hymns to the winds
And if you don't understand that
It's because you haven't been initiated
And you don't have ears to hear
Are you ready?
You know what this is doing?
This isn't just Greek that I'm showing you
This is Greek that is using cult code
And that code was found and declared and titled
In the early 1900s by a dude
A dude, classical scholar
That's when all the great German classical scholars
Were doing their thing
Like in the 1920s and 1930s, right?
Oh God, they were so ahead of the game
And this one German dude comes along
And he says, there's a code in the Orphic
It's called the vox, right?
It's the voice
Well, these texts that I'm showing you
Are using that code
Yes, yes, you mean a throne?
Isn't the throne?
No, it's a drug
So something that is polythronic
Is a compound drug
Yes, yes, you're getting it
You're getting it
Christen someone quick
As a matter of fact, let's look
There's going to be a Christing
You want to see a Christing?
I thought you'd like to see a Christing tonight
We're going to talk about Moses
And some answers
I know some of you just came from something
I know, take a shower
Don't blame yourself
Don't blame yourself
Yes, it's very important
It's very important
Okay, let's go to the next one
Somebody's going to write
I know, watch, I'm going to get an email
Somebody's going to take that
Totally literally
All right, are you right?
Where'd they all go?
Right, okay
What is this corner of the earth?
What am I throwing at you now?
I'm throwing at you more Greek
And what does this Greek say?
It says, it's just like that rising
Those locations where you have the rising
On the corners, those corners
Those cardinal directions, right?
From which the winds are derived
They come, they blow over everything
They have their arche in the corners
Okay, so remember, we've taken the drugs
We were talking to the angel
And the angel is giving us the scientific
At the time, the scientific explanation
Of what's going on
And where is this from?
This is Ptolemy
This is Ptolemy's tetrabiblos
And in it, Ptolemy is mapping out
The science that is behind
Everything you're seeing in the apocalypse
So when monists, fundamentalists
Draw pictures and the pictures look clownish
This is why they don't understand the text
Because they haven't dissolved the seals
They haven't applied the seals
Here, what does this say?
Right, that's where it has its origin
Then he talks about the rising
The next one, here's another part, people
What does this say? It's Ptolemy
He says these winds, right?
They come from this location
And they're commonly called the southern winds
They're very warm and they're monoticoi
They're monotic? Yes, they're monotic
What does that mean exactly?
Let's give me the next one
What kind of winds are we dealing with?
Monoticos, these are relaxing winds
These are loosening winds
Now wait a minute, am I talking about anthropology
And history here? Yes
Don't lose the perspective of the right
Remember, we made the contract
It's implicit
Hey, I don't care
You wanted it, we're going there
You love it, satanic congregation
What is it, it's relaxing or loosening?
Look at the lemata of Galen
Galen uses this word to describe the lemata
Now what are the lemata?
They are things used in unguents
Remember all that stuff we're putting in our eyes
You're laying there half dead
And you've got purple ooze drizzling out of your eyes
And your cheeks covered with a chalk
That will prevent it from burning your skin
My goodness
What is the angel going to say?
What is the angel going to say?
God is about to speak, are you ready?
And she, thanks, you're an idiot
Give me the next one, give me the next one quick
Give it to him fast, watch this
And I saw another angel coming out from the east
Or the rising point of the sun
And that doesn't just say the sun, it says Helios
As in the grandfather of the Medeo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, and what is he?
What's this angel on God?
