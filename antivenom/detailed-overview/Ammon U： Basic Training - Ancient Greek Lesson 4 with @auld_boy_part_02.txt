Anytime you're at one of these ancient drug parties
And you're there undergoing the right
Remember the angel is going to bring you something
What's he got in his hand?
He's got spragida
What the heck are those?
Guess what people, do you think it may be drugs?
What happens is the angel gives you those things
And he starts yelling in this great voice
Right?
Who's yelling that?
Those four angels, baby
Right?
Those four angels who are standing there
Implementing the winds
The power is given to them
To do what is unjust to all the world
Okay, are you there with me?
You see those four?
Don't mess around
Follow my instructions and you'll make it all the way through
Here we go
What is that spragida the angel was carrying in his hand?
It's that medicinal stuff, you bonehead
It's the medicinal stuff
Look, it's got that priestess of Artemis
Galen is out fishing for the stuff
He's going to be by his 20,000 pills of the stuff
Right? Take it back to use in medicine
Okay, so look, this is easy
We got this done, baby
We got everything
We got all the things that we need to make this work
Hit the next one
Medically it's a pastile
That thing that the angel is carrying in his hand
Medically it's a pastile
Give me the next one
Those are all medical sources
Nobody's read these, I guarantee it
He's read Paul of Ijina
Have you ever heard of Paul of Ijina?
No, you have a physician
Another great, very popular, very influential physician
From antiquity that nobody reads
He'll tell you
And then we've got Celsus there
Look, the Roman, he's the Roman doctor
Celsus is cool
This is not the Celsus who writes against the Christians
This is the Celsus who's the first century physician
Who's attached to the Roman legion
And so he's got to have all the...
He has a whole manual of drugs
He's got the drugs for the rites
He's got, you know, what do you do if you take bull's blood?
All that kind of stuff
He's got the those, he's got the ones that are...
Oh, just straight up medical
Oh, God, how do you treat somebody with an arrow puncture?
You know what I mean?
What do you pour in there that makes it better
After you cauterize it?
Oh, God, it's gorgeous
Pastels are put in places, right?
You got parts of your body
The pastel goes into it
And what are we going to do?
We're going to do this to all the slaves of God
If you're a Christian out there today
And you are not sealed
You're doomed
You're doomed
You want to see how you get sealed in the rite?
This is real antiquity, people
This is real antiquity
You want to see how you get sealed?
Let's go
Let's seal him, he says
Let's seal him, are you ready?
We're going to do it
Epiton metopon aton
On your forehead
On your forehead
Are you ready?
Okay, you ready?
Give me the next one
Here it comes
Here comes the seal, baby
Your forehead here, yeah
Look, the space between your eyes
That's great, fantastic
Surely there's no drugs rite going on right here
Hit the next one
What is this?
Metopon
Yeah, it can be a fa√ßade of some kind of temple
Na'u, right?
Or it can be a margin, right?
Or it can be a bandage for the forehead
Why would it be the word for a bandage to the forehead?
It's the forehead thing
You want to see what they did with these bandages?
They put drugs in them
Why?
So you could get Christed
You get it?
It runs into your eyes to people
Right out of the cloth
You don't have to make later on incisions
Which is the way the priestesses do it
You make incisions, you cover it that way
No, no, no
You take this in directly through the eyes
And if the light that in your eyes is singular
Then the whole body is full of it
You didn't get that until just now, did you?
No, you didn't get it
Because you're not a cultist
Yeah, fine
Now you're a cultist, right?
Satanic congregation, you know you love it
You know you love it
Let's get to something else really, really exciting
Give me another one
Give me another one up there
There's the bandage, we already saw that
Give me the next one
Watch this, people
It's also aromatic Egyptian ointment
Right, that you've got
You call it metopon
Right, but it's an actual ointment
Dyskorty's talks about it
Right, cool, cool, cool
Give me the next one
And what happens here?
Oh, I wanted you to see that
This calabane is the resinous juice of all hill
They call it tanakes
This is involved as well
Alright, so I got this forehead thing going on
It's Christing me, and I got drugs
Okay, fantastic, give me the next one
Here's your ponox, by the way
It's just the all hill
They used to call it all hill
Just, again, a very prominent drug
Look at the different
Orobacius is there
He's a physician, nobody reads him either
He was Julian the Apostate's physician
He actually dealt with the oracle
Directly, he's one of the last people
To ever work with an oracle
So, yeah
And give me the next one
Both, there's more and more drugs
Now, remember, what have you been advised to do
In the apocalypse, in the event of the apocalypse
What does Jesus, the Christ, the Son of God
What, and I'm about to give you a curveball
That's gonna shock you
What would Jesus Christ recommend that you do?
This says he recommends that you put the Cholurian
In your eyes
That you in Christ yourself
Okay, in order that you are not injured
Okay, the Christing is to prevent you
In the apocalypse from injury
You got it, fantastic
Let's go to the next one
This is beautiful, once you get the actual
Ancient words, I wanted to bring out
Because he says you're gonna have this in your hand
Right, look at these people
First of all, I just want to introduce you to the Phoenicians
We don't talk about Phoenicians a lot
But they're there
And notice that the Phoenicians are inhabitants
Of course, Phoenicia, thank you very much
Their chief city being Sidon
They appear in Homer as traders
Skillful in navigation, famously like for artistic skill
And for who?
Privacy? No
Piracy
Wait, what?
You mean like Johnny Depp? No
They're known for taking the booty
The lace
These are lace ties? Yes
These are the pirates
The Phoenicians people
They're the drug traders of antiquity
Isn't that nice?
They're not a nation
It's silly enough to think that they're a unified nation
You're in the wrong universe
No, they're groups
Groups of drug traders
Yeah, they traffic
That's why they're called pirates
Fantastic, keep going
And just in case you thought
This is a little bit of...
Talking about the Phoenicians who...
This character who's Odysseus is saying
Look, I had to do certain things
And I had to deal with these Phoenician sailors
You know what I mean?
And what happened?
I gave them Leida
Does everybody see the first word on the third line?
The bottom? Leida
What is that? Leida
