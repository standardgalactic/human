You have just learned putting together words
Actually, I want to go to the vocab first
Give me that one, please
You have just been learning to put together words
To take letters, individual letters
And string them together
I want you to look at the top word
I'm just going to pronounce it for you
Agorah
Agorah
And what is there?
The nominative is there
The nominative case, agorah, followed by the genitive
Agorahs
And then finally, the definite article
Hey, the word for the is there
Fantastic
And what is that agorah?
And I know you're there
You're like, it's a marketplace
Now, where are you?
If in Greek at this point
You can look at this word at the top of the page
And you can sound it out to yourself
Agorah
And you can tell yourself it's a noun
And it means marketplace
Then you are performing a peak
Okay?
That's where you should be
Fantastic
Adelphos
Look at the next one
Adelphos
Adelfu in the genitive
Ho
Ho
I don't care if you can deal with your spell genitive now
I just want you to know
That second part of the noun
That's the genitive case
Fantastic
Look at the third word
Oh, what is the Adelphos?
Brother
Anthropos
Person
Biblion
Book
And what is Biblion?
Look, that's the second declension
Neuter noun
You should know it's second declension
I'm going to show you the first and second declension charts
That you should have memorized by this point
I know, people are sitting there
He's taking too long
Shhh, stop
Trust me, please
You ready?
Doron
Underneath that
Doron
That's a gift
Then you get three prepositions
Ace, ek, and in
And what do those mean?
I mean, into, out of, and on
Fantastic
What's the noun underneath that?
Ergon
And you're sitting there as you're watching this
While I'm standing in this blue fog
And you're sitting there saying
Hey, ergon, ergon
Work
Work, ergon, ergon
What are you doing?
The repetition is imprinting this in your brain
There will come a time when you're like
Old boy
And you'll be pulling down text
And translating them
Right?
And you will have to have base vocabulary
Base, this is it
And these roots are delicious
Look at Edwin
It means work, we get ergonomics
Isn't that lovely?
Oh, God
Ergonomical engineering
Oh, God, I love it
Look at the one underneath that
Phaos, God
Underneath that is a conjunction
Or an adverb, it can act as an adverb
Chi, right?
Meaning and or even
Good
Next one, please, Chewie
Give me the other vocabulary
You got to know, because people
Give me the next vocabulary
Because if you don't know the vocabulary
You're ruined
You can't go anywhere without the vocabulary
Right?
Look at the top one, logos
That means word
Under that is mach√©, battle
Right?
Naisos, island
There's your definite article
Underneath that
The first one's masculine
The second one's feminine
The third one's neuter
I'm going to flash that paradigm
This is one of the paradigms
You should memorize
Right?
Ho, tu, toy, ton
Hoi, ton, toy, stoos
I can say that in my sleep
Right?
I can chant that to myself
It's kind of nice
Try it for the different genders
See how it feels
Love it
Did he just...
Martha, did he just say something
About trying on a different gender?
Ah, what's the next one?
Hold on, that's a road
That's a house
That's a dude, Homer
By their way to teach
Pimpe, to send
Techna skill
We get technological from that
Right?
Good
Hora is the countryside
Or land
Psuche, sorry
I almost added one
Psuche is a soul
Tuche, by the way, is chance
Isn't that interesting?
And then
We get an interjection
Oh, as in, oh, my
Oh, my
Let's go to the next one
I want you to look at these charts
Then these are the charts
From unit one
That you will need to pass
The exam coming up
In two units
Are you ready?
These are first declension
Nouns, feminine
Techna, meaning skill
Look at the endings
How they change
And the genitive data
And accusative cases
Techna, techna, techna
Techna, techna
Look at the little iota
At the end of the dative
Under the eta
Right?
Somebody jammed a little iota
Under there
I want to hear it
Some classes say
No, you don't hear it
And I say
I want to hear it
Techna
And then techna
In the accusative
Look at the plurals
Techna, techna
Techna, techna
What do you need to know?
You need to remember these endings
So that if you see techna
With just an eta
With just an eta on the end
You can say
Ah, I know this is a nominative case
I don't want you to worry
Too much right now
About the nuances
Of nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative
You're going to be learning these
Right?
Right now I want you to be able to
Identify when something is a nominative
A genitive, a dative, or accusative
Now, you students at AMANU
Who are doing the Greek
And they will progress through the course
You are investigators
You are investigators
This machinery is logical
And you must have it memorized
You must know that an eta by itself
Is a nominative
An eta sigma is a genitive
You must know that
