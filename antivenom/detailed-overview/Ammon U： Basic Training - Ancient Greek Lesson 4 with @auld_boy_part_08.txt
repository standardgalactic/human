This is just logic
It has nothing to do with your ability
To be smart or not
Nothing to do with brains
Simply remembering these forms
You have to be able to recognize it
Now if you're lucky
And you have an idetic memory
You look at that one chart one time
And boom!
If you're like me
You got to run that course over and over again
Until it's in your brain automatically
Repetitio es mater schientia
Repetition is the mother of learning
Says Cicero
We must repeat these things
If I were in your house
I would bring my whip
And I would force you
To repeat these over and over
Until you were sick of hearing them
That's how you do it
That's how you do it
Yeah, a lot of people like to write it out
Write it out
Engage your hand
Right
Good, give me the next one
What else do we need to know?
We need to know there are masculine and neuter nouns
And the first column here is masculine
Logos
The last column is neuter
Doron
So if you memorize that first column
And that last column
You'll be in good shape
Look at the endings
Os, u, oi, an
And don't worry about the vocative
I don't want you memorizing the vocative
That little VOC at the bottom
Forget that for now
Look at the plurals
Oi, an, oi, s, u, s
Memorize those endings
Masculine in the plural
Oi, an, oi, s, u, s
What is the neuter in the plural?
A, an, oi, s, a
Do I have to think of that?
No
I need you to get it to where it's muscle memory
Where you can jerk that up
Just out of nowhere
Where your wife can come to you in the shower
And smack you
And you can yell out
A, a, s, a, a, m
Right? Why?
Why did you shout out paradigms?
Well, somebody was flogging you
Well, you know, it's a thing we do
Making an exercise
Family building exercise
Love it
The Bacchic family
The family that whips together
Stays together
Yes, fantastic
Fantastic
Let's go to the one underneath that
Did he tell them to do what I think he told them?
No
People
Okay
Let's do this the right way
This is the last chart that you need to know
From this chapter
It is your...
What is this?
Oh, my God
It is your...
What?
It's the word for the
It's the word for the
It's called
What's the nerdy name for it?
You know, they always come up with
Sexy, nerdy name for things
The definite article
Are you the definite article?
I think I'm the definite article
In the world of...
In the world of grammar
Amin is the definite article
I like that, don't you, Chewie?
I like that
Chewie was mad tonight
Because she was watching with the rest of us
She was watching
And she was like, really?
This guy has a PhD?
And I said yes, dear
But it's in
Theology and Bible studies
Right, this is why you don't have
International conferences with
Classes and Bible studies
Professionally, this never happens
Why do Biblical scholars never show up
At international
Classics conferences
You know, for classical Greek
Why do they never show up?
Because, you know
If you're...
How do I put it simply?
If your shit isn't good enough
You know, you're gonna look silly
And so they know not to show up
It's amazing, the level
The level of professionalism with Biblical scholars
Is grossly...
You know, it's just...
People overestimate it, but...
Whatever
Here's your definite articles
How to...
Right, when you can say that to yourself
And you can keep in your brain
Remember, you're keeping in your brain
Nominative, genitive,
date of accusative
And you say, I don't want to do that
I don't care
Stare at this chart until it becomes
Part of your mind
Until, subconsciously
Bringing up images of definite articles
Changing through the cases moving
And that definite article comes
A sexy, beautiful lady
And what does that sexy, beautiful lady do?
She changes
She changes through being the subject
To being she who possesses to being
She for whom something is done
To she who is the object of the action
Right?
Follow this
Nominative, genitive, date of accusative
Please
This is what you must know
For Unit 1
For Unit 1
Now, I'm going to give you a couple of sentences
Really quick, and then we're going to call it
And you're saying, wait a minute
You didn't spend enough time on that
Are you ready?
If you've done everything I've just told you to do
You will be ready
Now, go run!
Do it!
Ready?
Here we are with the exercises
Look at number 9
Echne
Kaeton Adelfon Pidewee Ho-Homeros
Ho-Homeros is in the nominative case
So that's your subject
Your verb is Pidewee
So Homer teaches
Who does he teach?
He's got to teach somebody in the accusative case
Because that's what the verb is acting on
And here we've got Adelfon in the accusative case
Homer teaches his brother
What does he teach?
Echne
You've got a dative
A little dangling dative there
Don't you hate it?
You've got a little dangling dative
You just want, boop, you know
Just kind of push it
And it falls off the tree
You know what I mean?
That's your dative
Do you want to pick pears?
Here's your dative
Echne
With skill
When you're translating datives
I don't want you to think about it
They're the indirect objects
I don't want you to think about it
I want you to say
How am I going to translate this?
I'm going to translate this
This is to, for, or with
To skill?
No, that sounds stupid
For skill?
Ah, that sounds stupid
With skill
Aha
There's one
Don't try to figure your way out of this jungle
Just do exactly what I say
And you will survive this war
Good, fantastic
Look at number 21
Ho homeroos
