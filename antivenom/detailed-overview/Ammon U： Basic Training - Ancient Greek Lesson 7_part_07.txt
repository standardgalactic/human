This is getting in there
But she notices his mind
It's not working
He's not seeing the things
That he should be seeing
She's already got all of his men
And they're, oh, God
They've turned into pigs
They don't even know who they are
And you should hear the sounds
They make
Why do you need a man to talk?
With an Amazonian woman
You don't
They have no voice
In Amazonian government
And remember, the Amazonian women
Colonized lesbos
Right?
They built the intellectual foundations
Of lesbos
Wow
Does a man get a voice in that?
Man gets no voice
Why would you give a man a voice?
Look at those beautiful women warriors
Buried
They didn't need men
What'd they need men for?
They hunt men
Why would you let one of those things talk?
Did you bring the drug Ceterian?
Because this is a mating hunt
It's two months
What, at least one of the groups I was reading about
Two months in the spring
So if you and I are average Joe dude out there
And if you and I are average Joe dude
And we're on those steps
And we're just living our lives
Trying to survive
We've got to be very careful for two months
Depends on how you look
And I'm sure we'll get a shape
When you give a woman the abilities
To select a mate
After she's already slaughtered three men
Kind of puts a different spin
On the whole dating thing
And the whole selection process
You know what I mean?
Puts a whole different
And if you and I stay indoors for those two months
We may escape, right?
I don't know
Maybe if you're really good looking
I don't know
Maybe that's where you'd like to go
Hercules did
Hercules did
That's where he went
Yeah, he liked to wear
He liked to wear the dresses and stuff too
Yeah, he liked to wear them
Do we have that?
Should we bring it back?
Should we have that?
Should we bring it up?
Bring it up, where is he?
By the way, has anybody seen Jesus?
Has anybody seen Jesus?
There's some early texts to talk about
Milking his breasts
You know in the book of Revelation
That he's wearing a bra, right?
It's not a bro
He hasn't been drinking milk with steroids in it
It's a bra for his small but functional breasts
Yeah, they're a little swollen now
It's milking, right?
Usually they're smaller
The texts talk about small
Thank you Jesus
Wait, don't let him go away so quick
We love you Jesus
Here, how about some
As he's sitting there
Let's get some ambience
Come here Jesus
Come here, let me see those
Oh, does that hurt?
Poor guy
Let's see what happens
Let's see what these pirates are doing
Give me the next one
This is lovely
Let's just keep going
We only have four more
Three or four more people
Yeah, oh, here we go
So I'm fee poloing
There are some servants that Cersei has
Right?
And there's four of them
Who specifically prepare all of the banquet
Who is a dude or gonna come to
And they sing
Right?
And the dudes wander in
Hi, right?
Hi
And they eat the food
And drink the wine that she's made
And next thing you know
The party's over
And she stands up
And everybody starts beating these dudes up
And they don't know what to do
Because they're delirious
And they turn into pigs
They turn into pigs
Yeah
And what are these servants called?
They're called Dresterai
What kind of woman has a job where she lures
Drugs and abuses men
Dresterai
Give me the next one
What kind of people are these?
Surprise, surprise people
Drester is a laborer
It can be a working dude
It can be a working woman
Look at number two
A runaway
I.e. lace stays
Lace stays
This is the art
These are the young girl prostitutes
That we encounter in Jesus' trial
These are them
These are the apostles
Who are working for Jesus
These are those drug-knowledgeable teenage boys
Who ran away from their parents
Jesus came
Who's the last person to see James?
It was Jesus
He walked up and they left together
These are runaways, man
You follow me and I'll make you fishers of men
Everybody's been saying that for so long
I love to hear evangelical pastors
Who have never read the Bible
And don't know that Jesus Christ was arrested
In the public park with a naked kid
At 4 a.m. screaming, I'm not a trafficker
I love to hear them say
I'll make you fishers of men
Seriously, seriously
Okay
She's got four of these
And that's how the operation works
Why?
Because the sailors, they're going to crash
They're going to be abandoned
They're going to get ashore
And you know what?
The other side of the...
You know what we do in Azov?
We execute them
We execute them when they walk ashore
We execute them
Yeah
That's the world they're living in
They're digging up an Azerbaijan right now
Not the fairytale world
This is a real world
Where women, believe it or not
Can be in total control
Do you remember the oracles
That are guiding the Greek world?
Yeah, they're women too
Is there a connection?
Of course there is
Of course there is
It all comes down to the chemistry
Who's the father of Odysseus?
By the way, he's Laertes
This is what he's called Laertiades
The son of Laertes, right?
Laertes, it comes from the root
That...
Ah, not Ezekius
What's his name?
Oh shoot, I'll think of it in a minute
He's a Christian bishop
Who's writing and he says
I've been talking to the Greek historians
And they say this word is actually from Lyas
