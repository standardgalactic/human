So strong and them so weak
Okay, now this is the other side of the coin
Give me the next one. Watch this
Amen Hillman is not a biblical scholar
And his expertise does not
Apply to biblical scholarship
You're right. My expertise
Doesn't apply to biblical
Scholarship
And I'm glad that it doesn't because
Your garbage is so
Bad that the head of Dallas
Seminaries, Greek program
Wouldn't come on the air to talk
To me about what a Christ
Is
Yeah, weak
Weak stuff
Okay, next comment
Next comment. Oh, what is this?
Who is this from? Hanya
Like that
Was dosing off in bed and woke up
To keep it hard all the time
Now I'm wide awake

I told you I would come to you in your dreams
More important
Than a love letter
Is the train visit
Yes, oh my god, what is
He talking about? Give me the next one
Give me the next one
I don't think I've ever seen a podcast
With an actual non-human intelligence
I resent that
Non-human intelligence
Until now, wait, does that mean
Oh, I see, there's a reason
It knows so many ancient
Languages and is
Wearing that man like a robe
It's a
It's a demon
Possession, right?
Who do you think I'm possessed by?
Who do you think
I'll give you one guess
One guess, I'm the one
That slept with Eve
Oh god, don't you love it?
Isn't it gorgeous?
Isn't it gorgeous? You understand
What it means for me to take her
Out of my side now
And I'm going to show you that kind of stuff
I'm going to show it to you now
We're going to
To Lucian
To Lucian and the classicist will argue
They will say
Is this pseudo-Lucian
Or is it Lucian, right?
Is this pseudo-Galen or is it Galen
Oh god
Okay
We'll go to this pseudo-Lucian
Or possibly Lucian
Personally, I think it's real Lucian
But we'll go to this source called
The ass
The ass
The ass
We're going into Lucian's ass tonight
And we're going
To pull out
Something marvelous
Something marvelous
Are you ready?
Are you ready to go into the ass?
Right?
Everybody know, get your ears on
Get your ears on
Would you be surprised if I told you
We were all going to watch some people
Get Christed tonight
Mmm
You've never been to one of these services
I told you, I told you
Come on, splash bags
We're getting them going
It all comes down to this
Bump, bump, bump
Right?
It's the verb
It's the verb in Greek
And what is it for?
It's the verb to Christ

Prayer coming, did you?
Okay, let's do it
It's all because of this
It's brought to you by this
This verb here
Can you tell from my body language
I'm not that smart
Look, it's all from this verb
And this thing goes back
It goes way back
Let's not go all the way back
Let's go halfway back
Where does it go?
Who is Io? She is the cow
In Oistras
And she's yelling out
And she's saying, what kind of
Oistras is Christing me?
Can you see
The vision
Of the many-eyed God
Yeah
What
Is Io, whose name, by the way
Is a shout
It's a
Sacred shout
And what is she saying?
She's dealing with the Oistras
She's dealing with the drive
Now do you feel it?
Can you feel that drive?
Oh man, this is life
Right, this is...
Feel that vibration
Wow, this is life
Give me the next one
Where else can we see the Christ?
If you go way back
Into the Odyssey
You can see Christ in the Odyssey
And what's going on?
It's Odysseus
Look at the last word in the first line
Greek students, Odysseus
Odysseus
Odysseus
And what is he doing? He's out looking for
Pharmacon

The kind that kill people
Why?
Because he wants to Christ his arrows

We find Odysseus
The first time! What is he out doing?
He's out looking for the substance
That he's going to use to Christ his arrows
Where did he learn that stuff?
You would think
Maybe Penelope was some kind of
Amazonian
Oh god, he's whimpering a lot though
And they traded him around
The women traded him around
Oh, there's Amazonian
Love it
