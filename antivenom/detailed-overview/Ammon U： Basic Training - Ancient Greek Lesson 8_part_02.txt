Scientifically horrific
Using the same language
That you know who
Is using
The dude that was arrested
In the public park at 4am
What was his name?
Jesus
Jesus
What was he doing?
He was Christing
Are you ready?
Are you ready for this?
Give me the next source
The one I got my glasses on
She's smiling
This woman who's warning him
He's not looking for a witch
She says look
I got a warning
She says you gotta be careful
Watch out for yourself
Because of the woman
This gunayka
Of Hipparchus
Where he's staying
In every sort of way
This woman is talented
She is a magus
And a terribly frightening one
Why?
Because she's mochlos
Can you feel it out there?
What is mochlos?
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
You know what I'm talking about
Uh-huh
And who is she mochlos for?
She's mochlos
I want to read this literally
So that people don't send emails
Watch this people
Are you ready? Who is she?
She's mochlos pasitois naois
Woo
She's mochlos
For all of the boys
Nice
Those beautiful boys
She's a magus
She puts her eyes on them
Nice like a huntress
And if anybody ever messes with her
She totally
Avengers herself
With her talent, her skill
She turns these boys
Into
Pure animals
Pure animals
Wait, you gotta blow it up still
She turns them into animals
But if she sees one of these
Kids and it uses the word
Techno in there for the kid
If she sees one dude is handsome
Right
And she's trying to convince
Lucius, she says you
You're handsome, right? You're a kid
What's gonna happen?
You're gonna be food for her, right?
This is a
Pragma
This is something anybody can put together
It doesn't take a genius
To put this together
Look, you're a kid
Just like she likes
You gotta be careful
She's got the magic
She will
Drug you
She will drug you
She'll do something to you up here
She'll change you
This is Amazonian power, brah
Why do you think Odysseus
Is out looking for these arrows?
Why do you think he's out
Looking for this poison?
You know what this poison
Does to you?
Have you ever seen
An aroused Jesus Christ
Depicted in any sort of
Medieval art?
How about classical?
As far back as we can go
To the first century?
What's the image
Of Jesus Christ that we
Gonna call this up from the ether
What's this image?
Does anybody else smell the brimstone?
Come here
We're spanking Jesus
Jesus Christ
I love to spank you Jesus
I can see it
In my mind's eye I can see it
I can see it, it hurts him
Every time I do that
As above so below baby
He spanks Jesus
Martha, oh my god
Give me the next one
What's going on?
Somebody's getting naked
Right? Somebody's getting naked
We're gonna go
To polystra
We're gonna go
To that place of wrestling
One of those wrestling
Academies, what are they?
Dude, they are the places
Where we educate
Where we educate
What does he say here?
It's better
Look, Lucius, he just
Wants to find out what the magic is
He just wants to find
He wants to peep in
And he ultimately gets led
To peeping in
As a peeping Lucius
He's peeping in on
Watching what this woman
Is doing
And it's spectacular
He wants to have the Christ thing
Are you ready to watch your Christ herself?
Have you ever seen somebody Christ themselves?
Oh, you're gonna be surprised
Splash bags out
Here we go, give me the next one
Give me the next one
Okay, so look at this
Upon returning home, he discovers
Polystra alone and the two exchange
Amorous Barb's planning a rendezvous
After the Masters are asleep
So this is a teenage kid
Male and a
12 year old girl, female
And she is in the
Position of the slave
She's in the position of the slave
That's the assistant
The house assistant
To this master and his wife
That uses magic
And so Lucian is like, oh, you know
Who's gonna know? That's part of what that Greek said
Who's gonna know
That it's the things that they do
Right, it's the things that they do
The slaves
This was above, the slaves
It's the things that they do
What do they know?
What do slaves know? Look at that last line
They know
Both the good things
And those, you know, things that you want
To keep secret
That's what slaves learn
Right? Fantastic
Let's see what Polystra does
Give me the next one
You're brilliant, Lucian
You're brilliant
Thank you
So, what do they say?
They perceive it, you know
The husband and wife, they're not
The leaders of the estate, they're not there
They're asleep, so okay, good
So
What does he find her doing?
Lucian finds her, Polystra's sitting there
And she's prepping for
Some kind of little
Edible, right?
Some kind of treat
Some kind of dinner
And she's like
If you could only tell him
You could have warned him
You could have warned him
He's gonna end up a piggy pig, isn't he?
He is, he is
Shh, don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone, blow it up
No, did you bring
Piggy Pig? I don't know
So, what is
She's preparing him this nice
Heavenly banquet, you know what I mean?
And he can't help it
He sees her and he says, oh god
Beautiful, Polystra
The way that
You shake your bottom
And your little pot, it's
Gorgeous
The person
That gets baptized
In you
That is the most
Blessed person
Macarius
Yeah
That's a little bit of spin there
On the end of it, right?
So, is the horror building up?
Do you feel the queasiness?
Your eyes, right?
They're open, I'll keep dropping
I'll keep dropping it in the serum
You need the serum, bro
We need to moisten those eyes
Can you moisten their eyes? Did you have an image?
To moisten the eyes tonight?
Chewie, give us any kind of image
You've made sense, yes
Glorious
We're going to look into her eyes now
Using the language
That Jesus is using
We're going to draw Jesus
Out of this text
We're going to draw him out
By using his language
I'm going to show you
What real Christing is
Within
The right
That's prevalent in the first century
Fantastic
Give it to me, give it to me
We've located the place and everything
Okay, so
Lucian comes up to
His girl, his young girl
And what is she doing?
She's making the meal
And it's time to move
Beyond the meal
Lucian's looking for finding magic
And what does he find?
He finds that she
Has a very much insatiable
Appetite
And she's full
Of charm
Right?
And who is she? She's a Corracion
Who is this girl?
A Corracion, can you show me
What a Corracion is?
A little girl
A maiden
A maiden, are you kidding me?
Is this from, what time
Period is this? Do we always
It's disturbance, I think we go
Through the Victorians
Right? Does anybody smell it?
Smells a bit stale
Yeah, I love it, okay
Let's keep going
Let's keep going, don't slow down
Don't slow down, we've got to make it
In time, we've got to make it
Oh, I'm sorry, go back to that
There we go, so she's a Corracion
Right? And literally
That's a diminutive from
Corois
Which is the Mycenaean
So now you've stepped into the Bronze Age
This is where this mystery
Cult that has a Christ is coming from
Fantastic, and what does she say
Now there's two conditional sentences
Here for the Greeklings
