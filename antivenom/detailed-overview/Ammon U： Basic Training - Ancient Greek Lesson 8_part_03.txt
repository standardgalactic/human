Two conditional sentences
The first is a future less vivid
Followed by a future
Future more vivid
Oh my god
Gorgeous, now watch the first one
Here, right? She's all ready to go
What does she say to him?
She says, look, you would
Run away
Oh boy
If you had a mind
And a desire
To live
But I
This
This is full
Of fire
And
Steam
This is full
She's pointing to herself
This is full of fire and steam
And if you touch it once
What is she talking about
Touching? She's talking about
What she just mentioned
The pot
Notice I didn't translate that
The pot, if you touch this pot
Once
You will burn
That's what she says
She says you will burn
How are you going to be helped
Once you've been burned
By coming back
And taking the painful burn
Again
You know what she says
Give me the next one
She goes on
Did you think you were coming to a horror movie?
I think it's coming
We went to a horror movie
How do we get there?
Give me the next one
You're right
By the way, where do we see the
Where have we seen this girl before?
Remember
A dude who had all the money
Came to Jesus and he was like
Dude
He has position and power
I'm assuming the money was there too
But he comes to him and he's like
Dude, I've got a curation
And she's all passed out
Sounds like Eyes Wide Shut
Doesn't it?
I've got a curation
And she's all passed out
It's one of these little girls
And he saves her life
He says she's not dead
He brings her
Wakes her up
Because he knows what he's doing
He's the one who uses the drugs
That induce death and he told you
He told you evangelicals
He told you that
I'll give you drugs that induce death
And it won't harm you
Was nobody listening
When
He was doing the cult thing
At what point did you not understand
That Christing is a drug operation
That makes you
Horny
Did you know that? Yeah, it does
Makes you horny, that's what he says
Okay, let's get into it
Let's see what they're doing
What kind of aphrodisiac are these
Knuckleheads using
In Christianity with Jesus
Oh my god
Give me the next one
Give me the next
Which one?
We're going to talk about
Touching and
Disciples here, apostles
The apostles are telling you
Remember somebody's bringing Jesus children
You've got to realize that
In order that he can hop to them
And I'm going to show you
Somebody hop toing
Right?
You can hop to my in the middle for yourself
And that is what
We are doing
In the text
Yeah
To the Corracion
Alright
Okay
There it is
Now you understand
When they come to Jesus and they're like
Okay, we've got a Corracion
That went down, right? You've got to come
You've got to see what's going on, man
You know what I mean? Now you understand
Okay
Fantastic
Give me the next one
What happens now?
Yeah, so she says
She's going on with her speech
This is the Corracion
Now we're giving voice to the Corracion
Tell us
What's going on?
Her name means
The place where you wrestle
What does she say?
She says, look
I alone
You like this
And paradoxically
I
And the one
Who will make you
To be in that state
To be capacitated
And the only therapy
You're going to get
Is going to be me
Even if somebody
Is chasing you with rocks
That's what I thought
That's kind of unique
Trying to throw rocks at you
Get out of here, kid
Doesn't matter
Alright
It's because you want
My sweet
Sweet pain
You want the antidote
You want the antidote
To the mystery
You want to get to that point
You want that
Orgy
In the classical sense
Of an eye-opening cult
That
Gives you eternal life
Through a
Savior
And by eternal I mean Ionic
Through a
Savior
That's what you were looking for
In Lucian's
Ass
Are you ready?
You'll understand what I just said
As I show it to you now
Give me the next one
Isn't this classical literature fantastic?
Now do you know
Why Julian said
Don't let the Christians teach it
They'll warp it
They'll twist it and warp it
And turn it into
Godabaj, right?
And all the art will get skinny
People who are depressed
Your society will be depressed
This is just Lucian saying
Hey, you're right about that
From a distance
I saw you coming from a distance
And boy was I
You didn't just burn me
You turned me into a flaming inferno
And what'd you do
You put that invisible fire
Which I thought was a neat way to describe
Some kind of
Magical
Process
You put some invisible fire
Somebody said to me
If I put an invisible fire into your eyeballs
That's what he says that she's doing
She's filling them up
Especially in those little private
Naughty places
Remember
Do we have to go back
To the thing with Jesus
And Mary Magdalene
Where he's feeding her
His
Seed
After he has entered
Into self-pleasuring
As the text tells us
Do we have to go back to that place
We don't have to go back to that place
We just went there
And just recall it to mind
Look, if you don't eat it
We're gonna die
Who thought
Who thought it was a good idea
This dude comes out
This dude comes out and runs
Takes this woman out into the back
That later she was pardoned
Hundreds of years later she was pardoned
For possessing sex drugs
Right?
He's gonna
Take her up onto a hill
What does he do? He starts
Pleasuring himself
Why are there no paintings of Jesus Christ
Pleasuring himself
Because there are stories about it
There are stories from antiquity
About it
Is that what the canon was all about?
I wanna know the theology
Of Jesus Christ
Pleasuring himself
And then eating it
I wanna know the psychology
Of that too because it's a little
Unpleasant
Did you think you would see that?
I told you guys we're going
To an ancient
Right, a mystery
Right, okay let's watch
Christ each other
I don't know if they're ready for this
Bags on, give me the next one
And
What happens she says
You should remember young guy
Right
You can't really
Reach manhood like you're reaching
Without demonstrating your skill
And wrestling
What do we have here?
Is anybody
Disturbed
Is anybody
Disturbed
There's a little disturbance there
Why is that?
Because you're getting used to the picture
That is the original mystery
I've got a word
For all the monks out there
You give me the next one
I've got a word for all the monks out there
It's not
But it might as well be
Keep it there
Who is he by the way
She describes him as
At least he
You know he is one of those
Thebes
That would attract
The lady of magic
Who we know we're using
There's sex drugs all the time
Right sex drugs all over the place
And who are they
Who are they gravitating towards
They're gravitating towards
The aphib
The one who has arrived
At puberty
So this is who Lucius is
Finally we see a description
