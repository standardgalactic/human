Who is he? He's an aphib
And people who are Christing
Are doing it
For the sake of access
To the aphibs
Yeah
Well then you say what about Jesus Christ
He's got all of his aphib students
Right? With him
That he's taken from
Right off their parents' ships
Right?
So they could go fish for men
Right?
He's taken them right off of that
Right out of that life
Put them right into that
Lastic right
Where the boys are being drugged
Right?
All of this is being made possible through Christing
Because Christing makes
You
Psychotically
Horny
Disturbingly horny
Right?
Ever aroused
Ever aroused
Do you see what it brings out
You know what you can bring out of people
You can bring demons out of them
Yeah
Jesus Christ did it
With Mary
Seven times
He was saying it
It was impressive
Why do you think we go there
Stop
You're going to scandalize me
When I read you the priest's words
By the way
We'll get there
Actually let's show it up now
Where's the ass
I'm looking for the pick of the ass
There's one
Right?
You'll notice the head
Of Jesus Christ
Is the head of an ass
And you'll wonder to yourself
What is going on
I'll tell you what's going on
Artificial intelligence
Is reaching into the void
And pulling out from it
This
Because this is the image
That we first see
Of Jesus Christ
Look at what he's doing
He's worshiping
And there's Jesus
On the cross
It's not a very sophisticated cross
But remember this is graffiti
And rock
What the hell is it
It's scratched in there
Son of a
Look at the last letter
The first scratch
He didn't mean to do that
And what is his head
What is his head
Is that on plaster
Look what is his head
It's stone
It's the head of an ass
The head of an ass
Why does Jesus have the head
Of the ass
I'm going to tell you the answer
To that question
Which has never been answered before
I'm going to quote it to you
From
The first century
Very popular
Very popular
Ass
Story
Yes
Written by priests
Love it
Is this the next one
Look people
Just so you don't think
That this is
The most
That it's my creation
When I keep telling everybody
The sex and the drugs
Are all part of the mystery
Is Christing yourself with a sex drug
So you can be around boys
Okay
Canitis
You can do the canitis thing
Jesus Christ
Fine
Just so you know it's just not me
I want you to look
At the wonderful description
They gave in this reader
Which is gorgeous
For all my students have been through
The intensive course
Just swamp this reader
Just swamp this website
We're going to list that website and everything
We'll do it later
The love-making scene of Lucius
And Pleistria is filled with
Devlon Tondra
Involving military and wrestling
Metaphors
The greeks describe
Or the greek language
Loves to describe sexuality
In the most vivid of terms
The most vivid of terms
What Lucian does
Pleistria
Offers herself as the wrestler
And they're going to wrestle
And she tells him exactly
How she wants him to wrestle
And he wrestles
And why does he wrestle?
Because he really wants her
To use the magic
He wants her to use the magic
He wants her to use the drugs
Right?
And he thinks he's going to get there
He thinks he's going to get there
This way, it's like a sacred path
That he's on
It's like a sacred path
A mystery purification
Now, if you're
Surprised that Jesus Christ
Was performing mystery purifications
On a Phoebes
I'm sorry
But the history
Is wrapped up in the language
Braun, it's easy to get it
There's no theologian, I guarantee you
There's no theologian alive
Who has ever read
Lucian's ass
To every theologian out there
That gets my goat
Do we have Penelope anywhere?
That gets my goat
It really, really gets my goat
The cross
Must cover the sins
Of Penelope
Do you understand?
Jesus Christ
Was in it
Using drugs
To interact
Sexually with the Phoebes
Right?
Okay
Give me the next one
Let's look at more, let's go deeper into the ass
Okay
Are you ready?
Here we go
Here we go, oh do you know what's happening here?
Okay, so look
She just tells him, you gotta prove yourself
As a wrestler, you punk
Okay
So, she strips down
She strips down naked
Standing totally naked in front of him
Right? And she sets things up
She gets herself
Ready
In front of him
And she says, hey
Merakion
Do we have the next slide, I think is what
Merakion
I cannot bring that one
Oh, here it is
A boy, a lad, a stripling
He is going to be stripping
But
Stripling, okay
We'll say it, the stripling
Merakion
So that's how she addresses him
Right? It's, you know, clever
Give me the next one
Hey
Merakion
Take off your clothes
And oil up your part
With the Mer
Uh-huh
And you're going to do this so that you can embrace
Your antagonist
So you can embrace your antagonist
You know what that is? That's wrestling
You get oiled up when you wrestle
Then
After those two have wrestled
You take that and you scrape it off of them
And you can use that as a drug
Yeah, that's what they do
That's how advanced
This scientific knowledge is
Look at it
I know it's alien, but look at it
Oh, my God
Are you ready?
Okay, now here's the
Everybody, this is going to be
As scientific
As I can possibly make it
And I'm just going to
Paraphrase
She says, I want you to put me
On my back on the bed
And I want you to grab my legs
And I want you to spread them
And I want you to rip me apart
Okay
Okay
That
Is the translation
That
Is what you have in the company
Of
The
Stripling
Who is being
Inducted
By the magic rite
Of Christ
Okay
And what does she say
Oh, my God
Let's go to the next one
There's some other stuff there
Some details, but it's quite
It's quite explicit
And I want to be as scientifically
I want to remain
As pure as we possibly can
Right
And so what does she say
He starts talking
During the wrestling
And what does she say
She slaps him in the face
Right
And she says
What kind of wordy
Student
Apostle have I taken
What kind of wordy
Apostle do I now have
Right, she slaps him in the face
Right
Why
Why
Why
Is that part and parcel
Wait, the drugs are coming
Give me the next one
There's just a few things I want you to see
Oh, God
So look what he says
We finished
We had all of this
Heednism
We had all of this child's play
And I know
When I say that
