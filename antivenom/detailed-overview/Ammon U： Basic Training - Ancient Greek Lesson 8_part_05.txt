I understand it causes
Just a tiny bit of nausea
A tiny bit of nausea
But you need to see what the Christ is doing
You need to see what's going on
He says
They totally crowned themselves
It's a bit colloquial
We totally crowned ourselves
In this night agony
This night struggle
This night wrestling
And there was a lot of truffe going on
Right
There was a lot of just pleasantness
Right
So much of it that I forgot
That I was supposed to be going
To Larissa
Right, and then I come here
Right, because I wanted to learn
I wanted to learn
What did he want to learn
So he turns to here
He says, hey
Baby
Hey, baby, show me
The magic woman
Right, show me the woman
Who changes her form
Show me that queen
Right, okay
He wants her
To show him the magic
And wait, blow it up
What does she say to him?
He further says, you know
This is something he's had on his mind for a long time
He's had this image in her head
In his head, excuse me
And he wants to fulfill this
He wants that magic
He wants that magic
To come out of her
He wants her to have the source
And she tells him, hey bro
Right
You've got the wrong person
Right, you've got the wrong person
He says
This is inserted
This is in the wrong area
Here he's saying, actually give me the next one
We're supposed to have the next one
He's talking about the women talking about him
He further says, you know
You've got some great power going on baby
Because
Ladies know that I'm a virgin
Right, ladies know it
And they'll look at me and I'll avoid it
But you
I couldn't turn away from
Right, I couldn't turn away from that vision
Right, so he's like
If you have this gift
I want to know what it is to fly
Right
They think I'm
Ataman teen
Right, I want to know what it is
To fly, give me wings
And what does she say
What does she say the next
Oh god
Oh, look at the last word here
Psuha go guza
Right, Psuha go guza
What is she doing
She is a soul
Chaser
Soul conveyor
And what is she doing
She's taking him
Into captivity
With her erotic warfare
Her erotic warfare
Okay, now if you're looking
An Amazonian in the face
This makes great great sense
And there are Amazonian marks
All over this
Right, who
Do you know a 12 year old
That's so forcefully
I mean she's smack smacking him around
She's drugging him
What is she
Right, and he's like
Look, I want to see the transformation
I want to see the change
Are you ready for the change
Give me the next one
Are you ready for the change
She knows nothing of magic
And promises to arrange
A meeting between Lucius and her mistress
Right, so Plystra, what does she say
She says cut it out
Right, we're going to stop playing here
Right
What's this thing
Who's able to walk this path
To do the magic
On Eros
Right, he's the lord
Of the art
You cannot
Overcome
Eros with the magic
It's his bow
It's his bow
Do you understand
If you haven't figured out Lady Babylon
If you haven't figured out yet
I'm going to pull you forward
Because a lot of people have figured this out already
Eros is the devil
Eros is the devil
Eros is the dawn bringer
Yes
Isn't that beautiful
And so Plystra says
Look, calm down
Calm down, you can't have that power
Right, what does she say
What does she say
I don't know
The magic
I cannot
Right
I don't learn my writing
Why is that
Because the magic
Comes through
Those spells
The magic comes through
The prescriptions
She hasn't gotten
To that level yet
She doesn't learn any art
And she says not only that
But the lady of the house
The one who can do it
She's totally jealous
She's totally jealous of the skill
And she keeps it guarded
She doesn't let other people
Know about it
She just practices herself
She just practices herself
Right
So they go to look
They go to look at her
To see what she's doing
They, I'm not describing this
From this passage, I was reading ahead
What are they doing
They're going to watch the lady of the house
Then actually perform magic
And of course what does it start with
It starts with her
Christing herself
Christing herself
And she's doing it by taking these boxes
She's got a chest full
Of drug boxes
Boxes
Boxes
Boxes
She takes it out
And she takes this
Ointment
And an alabaster
And she cries herself
She cries herself
Down she wished
She could have seen that
Lucian did
Lucian did, he saw the whole thing
Through a little crack
He saw the whole thing
He somehow got the picture
And what did he do
He asked
Because she turns into
A feathered
Night raven
Isn't that gorgeous
A feathered night raven
And she flies off
Here's some of the stuff that's going on
I want you to see the actual right
Look at the first line
She's naked and she goes
With these lamps
And it's the same word that they're using
In Revelation
For the lamps
What do you do with these lamps
She takes two
Measures
She takes two of these
Measures
Of frankincense
And
She puts it
On the lamp
And standing there
She talks
Over the lamp
She says many things
And then she opens up her chest
She takes out one of these boxes
Right
And she uses one of these drugs
Give me the next one
What is she doing with the drug
What is she doing
She creatives it
She crisis it
She is
A
She is a Christ
Remember this is contemporary
This is the contemporary usage
Of Christing at the same time
That the gospels are being recorded
She Christ herself
Why did you do it they ask the witch
Because my husband couldn't take me
To the places that the devil could
My husband couldn't take me
To the places that the devil could
My husband couldn't take me
To the places that the devil could
And let me tell you something
Those of you who are out there
Whose husbands can't take you
To that place
In your dreams
In your dreams
I love it
I love it
Can you feel that
Can you feel that ancient
Worship of Aphrodite
Can you feel that
It's got a buzz to it
Bacchic buzz to it
Give me the next one
Here we go, it's after the Christ thing
After the Christ thing
What else did I bring
I just wanted you to see
She's that night raven
That's where she becomes
A night raven
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Too bad we don't see the night raven
Elsewhere
Give me the next one
Look
What's Lucian doing at this point
He can't believe what he's saying
He's like rubbing his eyes
I can't believe my own eyes
Did I see that?
Was I dreaming that?
Right?
Do you know what I need?
Do you know what I need?
I want to be
Look at the second
The second to the bottom
Sixth word in
Chrisasa
That's what he wants to be
Make me a Christ
Make me a Christ
Make me a Christ
With what?
With that pharmacon
That you have at the bottom
Give that to me
I want to try
What it tastes
Do you see the draw
