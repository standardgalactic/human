Got a mental picture
Men who are part horse
If you didn't
Read the Bible
You didn't see in the book of Ezekiel
That we've got two
Coracia
Girls who were there
And what are they doing
They're looking at the pictures of the Egyptian men
And what do they do
They go down to Egypt
Why do they go down to Egypt
Because they want to partake in the mystery
They want to be involved
In the mystery
This is Ezekiel
Dirty, dirty, dirty prophet
Talking about dirty, dirty mystery
Okay
Give me the next one
Does it bother you that the Bible is so graphic
You should
They want us all to start learning the Bible
Here in the States
We're going to start learning the Bible
Here's more
Ask for you
Are you ready? A foreign lady
Pays to be able to sleep with Lucius
Now this woman comes out of nowhere
And I say woman
Hesitantly
Hesitantly because she's really not a woman
And we'll see that in a minute
What does she do?
She says look she's got a lot of money
I'll just, she says she's got a lot of money
You know what I mean
And she's burning man
What does she do? She sees that ass
And she says oh my god
Can I rent
Your ass for one night
And the guy's like sure
Sure you can
So she ends up
With the ass
In a Christing situation
Where he
Confesses
Where the ass confesses
Where he confesses
What does he confess?
Oh god
Where is it? Look at the very bottom line
Look at the very bottom line
He confesses that the chrismati
To muro
So the chrism
Of the myrrh
Has done what to him
It's in the next
What is it done?
Oh there it is
Right
It's put him into a position
It's put him into a position
And he's describing, oh this is a later description
I know what I did, I took this from later
But he first describes
What the chrism does
And it does for him
It puts him into a place that he sees
He sees
That woman
Slash
He sees her
As an agent
That attracts him
He sees her
As beautiful
And how does he do that? He does that by means
Of the chrism
By means of the Christing
Do you want to see that? Remember
When you go to a temple
And the temple priestess
In this healing temple
Is bringing you to the place of climax
Under the influence of drugs
Right?
I'm not talking just men
Because the women are doing it in groups
Okay
So when you come
To the pinnacle of that
Biological act
Under the influence of their drugs
The point is to bring
You healing
To bring you healing
And when you see that priestess
In the eyes of the drugs
She becomes that beauty
That absolute divine beauty
Isn't that interesting?
They're using sexuality
And drugs within
Christian right
Right? This is where Jesus is coming
From
Okay
Now you know what a Christ is
Right? I think that was...
Give me that last one again
Oh
Yeah
So what does he do? He turns
On asinine
He eats the rose, turns back into human
He's got to explain to people
He says this lady's servant
What does she do?
She gave me this Christing
This magical Christing
Oh, seriously?
Yeah
And he goes on to blame her
He goes on to blame her for having
Information in him
Right?
Then you know, happy ending
He's lost his shell
Well, I want to tell you
Why that was so prominent
A theme
This very, very popular author
Talked about that
And when you look into
The transference of youth
Here's the thinking
Okay, so now you've got
To get back on the ship, we're going to go back
We're going to go back to our time
And space
And when it gets down to it then
When you're looking at that
Right? You have to ask yourself
What is happening?
What is happening in the people
That are participating? Both
The child that is
Being indoctrinated, drugged
And you know, I forgot
To tell you about these kids, these canidois
These disciples
What do they do?
They cut off their testicles
Right? They cut off their testicles
You know, there's not a
There's not a lot going on
Down there
Right?
There's not a lot of testicular development
So you are creating
For the sake of the mystery
Your disciples have to be
That proper
That proper vessel
That proper vessel, right?
With Mary up in the mountain
And he's like, look, you got to eat this
And Jenny masturbates
Right in front of her, right?
That kind of
Approach is the same
Root that you see, it's the same approach
You see on
The side of
This asinine
Cult, right?
It's the same root you see in it
She, polystra, right?
Is affecting
That real
Very real magic
He only has to be transformed
To learn
To get to the point that he's born again
Right?
This is the mystery religion
Of the first
And it's coming to us
Through an
Apollo's
Priest
Within the written
Word
Through mother greek
Thank you
For coming tonight
Thank you for coming
I guess here's what we'll do
I want chewy to play the exit
But I'm not leaving
I'm leaving, I'm going to go get the drill instructor
For those of you who are working
Steadily through
We're going to look at some things from unit 3
So go ahead and hit the outro
Please
I'm
Flipping tables
Taking to the bank
At the gates of Avalon
The wolf man regulates
Avalon, Avalon
Lady Medea
Lapis lazuli lines the walls
The news sings with me
Extra illumination
For the vibration
I have under me
The knowledge of our genesis
Crystal towers
The Punisher Frank Castle
Purple rain
For the news I sing a favorite song
All night long
No stems, no seeds
That you don't need
Got a bag of goodies
Ice creamy cream
Hail Satan
Close minds forever
Coming through in waves
Tower house on the hill
House of Frankenstein
Darkness to dreams
Our dream of Jeanie
High purple
Medea should work you
High purple
High purple
High purple
Medea should work you
High purple
High purple
High purple
High purple
Medea should work you
High purple
High purple, high purple, look at you, she'll work you.
High purple, high purple, high purple, baby.
All right, you've come here.
If you're watching, I'm in black.
You've come here because you've been working through units one and units two.
And the folks from your laboratory have contacted me and I thank everything.
Everything was coming along swimmingly, at least from what I saw.
I got to go back and go over that.
But I want you to know people are working hard, Nancy's working hard.
All boys working hard and making videos for you to be walking yourself through the process.
We've gone through and I can't forget fish and whoever else is currently involved with TA.
Excuse me, we'll promote you actively later.
You're doing a fantastic job and keep it up.
Keep it up, fantastic.
Give me the first thing that we're going to have to look at.
You people have been motoring through one and two, units one and two.
And you have seen that unit two was about verbs.
Unit three is the second half of your verb section.
And we have learned some tenses in our verbs.
We've learned the present.
We've learned the imperfect.
We've learned the future.
We've learned the heiress.
Those are all tenses.
Now we're going to learn the perfect and the pluperfect.
The last two tenses that we're going to look at.
And then we're going to look at using a different mood.
This is all indicative that you've learned so far.
It's all indicative.
What is indicative?
It is just a simple declaration.
I go to the store.
I will go to the store.
I went to the store.
Simple declaration.
What are the subjunctive and the obstative moods do?
That's what we're going to start working with.
So I've got to teach you the obstative and subjunctive morphology.
I want you to see the morphology.
And we're only going to be talking about two tenses with the obstative and subjunctive.
Excuse me.
We're going to be talking about the present and the heiress.
Why is that?
Because when you switch out of the indicative mood, the verb just hear it.
The verb loses its sense of time and gains a very strong aspect.
And what is the aspect?
