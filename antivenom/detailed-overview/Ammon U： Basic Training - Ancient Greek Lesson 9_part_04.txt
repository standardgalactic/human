him from the dead three days later just like we're about to do these witnesses why is it taking three
days i don't know i don't know it's the drugs maybe if you go too far you kill them maybe that's like
the limit that you can go you know they're doing stuff to the body while they're doing that too
why do you think they found that boy in the tomb what do you think he was doing didn't anybody find
oh you thought oh here comes the oh the angels oh no no it's a right that boy is there because
that kid is part of the ride and you notice what he's wearing what's the dude wearing little kid
wasn't he's wearing the gown that an initiate in a cult wears yeah right what is what is our
laystace right jesus is a laystace too but what is our laystace alexander say he says
make sure and bring me the boys that are the most pretty right don't don't bring me any boys with
defects you think that when jesus was picking out boys on the sea of galley and he was like hey
you and you you want to come with me you don't think those were pretty boys
i'm about to show you where he took them he took them somewhere private peter james and john
not only were they the boys that he took to the to the garden of guests so many but he took them
up into the mountains like he did mary remember what he did with mary what jesus christ did with
mary magdalene he self-pleasured and ate it and offered her and she was like oh my god right
okay you didn't know that jesus existed did you yeah no they said it not me i didn't make that up
i didn't make that up hi jesus doesn't he look looks like he looks serious there he looks like
he's a little bit angry like what you put me in hell for him i i didn't put you in hell jesus
you put yourself in hell gorgeous you got yourself crucified can you imagine how what's
what are your odds of getting yourself crucified when you're in the middle of a right that involves
psychotropic substances what what are the chances of that right i don't think you can plan that good
i don't think you can plan that good i wonder what he did after they revived him
i wonder what he did no seriously people when you put somebody into the death right they appear
and they say this in antiquity they appear completely dead that's why medea was able to
put the dragon into a state where they thought he was dead right just with drugs that's how
profoundly the thanosimone as they call it that jesus said i'm going to give you this thanosimone
in the gospel of mark right that drug death inducing drug um you know it takes it takes
us three days to do its job you revive the person and they're freaking born again born again it's
the right of rights now the funny thing is you got to put them into a sexual state right that's
the part of it that i keep trying to show you is in the bible right we even had the ointment in the
eyes we got christed in our eyes right was that white christing i can't remember
what is the world look people let me stop for a minute what is the world going to do
when it realizes that christing is a drug process and that the processes that are involved in christing
are usually ending up in sexual intercourse or some kind of stimulation to the moment of climax
how is that i'm not gonna be able to say moment of climax pretty soon so all you pastors wives you
get what you can of me right now because they're gonna come after me yeah no they're gonna come
after me what chewy that's i'm sorry you don't like my taste what's wrong what's wrong it's in
those dreams baby i love it i love it okay now can we get back to the text get let's go where else
are we gonna take look this is a good date so far right well i want you to i want you to hang on there
because um people are going to fight against the return of this beast and what are they gonna do
you they're gonna conquer them how are they gonna conquer them they're gonna conquer them through
the hyma through the what through the hyma now that word does mean blood but in its earliest form
it means body fluid yeah so there is it's not just blood there is an idea of it's the vital
fluid right the vitals right how did they conquer they conquered through the vitals of
the fleece now that's where christians like to insert the lamb of god
no no
how do you fight how do you fight a system that is a performed pharmaceutical
um theatrical production how do you beat that you don't beat it with anything but the fire that
it's using you beat it with the drugs all right you beat it with the drugs we need that blood
that blood and flash are absolutely necessary absolutely necessary remember i can lick this
stuff and get high okay they're making inks dies that you can lick off of the skin you ever lick
skin with dye on it maybe you should try then and it puts you into a state and it's an altered
mental state for the sake of the right for the sake of right right make sure you've got your
viagra on right and this is universal viagra this isn't just for males right this is female
viagra too the blood can go places yeah yeah fantastic give me the next one that sounds a
little bit young um when they finish now what's gonna happen when they finish their witnessing
a beast is gonna come up out of the abyss and he's gonna what's he gonna do he's gonna make war
and he's gonna conquer him and he's gonna kill him you mean the answer will be the
theriac let's i tell you what let's do this christians let's have a let's see whose christing is
more powerful let's see whose christing is more powerful let's bring the two witnesses let's send
them into death and bring them back and when they come back and are resurrected we'll know
we'll know the power of the ancient mystery we'll understand it we don't need faith
the ancient mystery is anthropology right it's why jesus christ was arrested in a park with a naked
kid yeah now let's see let's see give me the next one give me the next one oh god okay listen
okay i'll stop i'll stop because look um the two witnesses their bodies are gonna be publicly
exhibited in the square of some great city this says okay their bodies when they are given
the death inducer and they're gonna sit there and what do we call this remember the pneumatic
gospel that we mentioned last time mark is writing about a pneumatic he's writing a form of a pneumatic
gospel according to clement and those guys right a pneumatic gospel something that you're
going to give to people who are going to be involved in the ritual sex and drug use
all right this is their gospel that's why he calls it here he says it's called the the pneumatic
Sodom where is the city that their bodies will be exhibited it's the pneumatic Sodom
you can also say egypt that's just this person's opinion right you could also say egypt but
you and i know what it is are you ready now i'm doing this backwards so that you can see it
it is the place where kurios the lord was
staurost where he was crucified
that is the place where the bodies will be exhibited
yeah yeah okay now i know that you're thinking oh that means Jerusalem no you missed the point
