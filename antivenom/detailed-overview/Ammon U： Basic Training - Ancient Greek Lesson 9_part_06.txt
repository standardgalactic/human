it's just part of the deal and when you do so they become a little factory you can pump drugs into
them and you can use them to get your drugs you have to wrap a bandage around that spigot
it's your tax it's your bible all right don't blame me don't blame me this must we must go to the
far corners of oklahoma this bible must be taught to people this bible must be taught to people
indeed hail satan hail satan yeah very good very good i agree hail satan he's not doing this
he's trying to bring it to light isn't that interesting he's the light bringer excellent
excellent are you sure he's a he are you sure huh defue defue you know i was in that place
i was in that place can you see the stuff in my eyes can you see it yeah i was in that place
let's see what happens i got a couple more i got a couple more it's going to creep you out a little
bit give me the next one boom and what happened uh jesus after a few days oh yeah he took custody of
peter and john jacob and john and what did he do oh god he takes him away into a mountain
right he says hoopsaylon but they're high mountains are not really high mountains right this is not
you know not anything like you would consider high mount but they've got some things right big hills
and he takes him up into the into the backwoods and what does he do with his three kids that he's
taking custody of parlambo that's what that means yeah see you don't read it you think it's three
dudes with beards going out what are they hot what are they camping with peter we're in plight or
something no stop so he's got these three teens and he's taking them out carries them out right
he's taking charge of he carries them out into a place the text says where they can be alone
all by themselves why would jesus want to be alone with teenage boys are you gonna are you
gonna watch what happens it says i'm not kidding you it says he transformed he transformed right in
front of their faces okay are you ready remember remember there's drugs involved here there's christing
right so okay he transformed and what does he transform to now those of you are christians who
thought the fairy tale right who believe in peter pan and that kind of thing you know what i mean
i can fly right um you were thinking something completely different that was going on because
that is what you have been taught through translation the theologians have so faked
your texts that you can't really see that underlying classical layer to them that first
century layer you can't and what happens what happens what do the kids do they say holy crap
elijah and moses are standing there all of a sudden and they're talking to jesus
wait a minute he took you out of the woods right and he suddenly he does something and he transforms
right has he been giving you guys stuff to eat again right people talk about jesus feeding the
multitude okay you realize when he dipped that bread into the into the stuff the bowl that gave
that made judas act so weird right and go off and tell on him
right he's been drugging these people right he's been drugging them he's drugged on the cross
hanging there his death inducer reaches him while he's being crucified
and so what happens they see moses and elijah holy crap what what happens what happens look it
gets funny it gets funny and people never read the bible so they don't realize the humor yep
what happens we're almost done people and he and peter answers them and he says to him hey rabbi
hey rabbi right now what is really cool about this reference to rabbi is Jewish rabbis don't appear
until like the first maybe as early as the second but the first really right and they
really make judaism the judaism that you see worship today the synagogue judaism
really starts in Hellenistic um alexandria right and it gets a text develops text the
rabbinical judaism the thing that you call judaism all the rights and how holidays and laws
that doesn't come out until the first bc first ad somewhere in that range right and jesus
is right there you don't have rabbis in the fifth century bc that doesn't exist
right jesus is coming about this is what's going to screw with your brain tonight jesus is coming
about at the same time that the first rabbis are coming about and he's being called a rabbi
therefore jesus is a founder of judaism oh my god yahoo yahoo haishim and all the crew
holy mackerel
okay so you mean judaism and christianity are two monist cults that develop out of the same bed
yeah and they're both influenced by the greek mystery yeah oh my god my god
hmm don't you love that history is gorgeous the real history is more beautiful than the
you know the the fake stuff and when everybody saw the theologian either here or danie jones or
no i was thinking for and i don't know i can't remember who ran the clips and who did what um
but when they saw him say uh duck tails dan right when they saw the theologian step up there
and say well our earliest you know is isaiah eighth century baba huha are you sure it's the
eighth century and it's not right none of those texts go back that far right there isn't any
hebru at that time doesn't exist all right there's a ton of greek there's 50 000 because you know
there's 50 000 copies there at least by one report there's 50 000 scrolls in alexandria alone and
alexandria is not doesn't end up being the only library right romans have libraries too
fantastic and there's mostly greek
why is that oh it's gorgeousness okay give me the give me that same verse again let me just
make sure i got it all yep oh okay so he caught no i didn't get it all he calls him rabbi says look
this is peter they're up in the mountain jesus did some kind of transformation and now they're seeing
dudes talking to jesus and peter says hey um well it's good for us to be here right which is a weird
why would you start with that right is it is there a question maybe you shouldn't be there okay
but it's good for us to be here right and to see this stuff let's make three tents one for you one
for moses and one for elijah and now watch this right because they're seeing they're seeing stuff
give me the next give me the give me the next one um jesus didn't know how to answer him
for they the kids were echphobic that ech is an intensifier phobic is being afraid
they were totally terrified right and that's why peter's telling oh it's okay it's okay we're
it's okay that we're here let's build three temples let's build three tents three one for you one for
you one for you and jesus doesn't know how to answer him right now this is the son of god we're talking
about and look at the first five words of this line of mark nine six
he didn't know what to say in response he had no how to respond right does that sound like an all
knower to you that doesn't it sounds like a dude who's out drugging children for the sake of sex
rights now he already had mary is this the same place he took mary if i had a place where i took
people oh you know you know my kids could say oh you know dad he takes people out to the back
woods right who does this who does this yeah i'll tell you who does it some creep oh
