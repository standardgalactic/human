Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, indian girls crazy and the scots men
Once they'll bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've got your sellin' and you got your
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to Satanic Initiation
It's great to have you tonight
We have a fantastic lineup for you
What we're going to have going on is
I'm just going to come clean with you
And I'm going to bring you my sources
And these are a couple of people that you haven't seen
And she probably don't know
But we're getting access to them
That ship to go right back to that purple
People have been saying, remind me about the purple
Yeah, there's a good reason for that
Tonight it all comes together at our point
At our apex
And we will bring forward that birthing mother
Love this, love this
This is the bond of necessity, welcome
Music
You know, as I get ready to take us on a trip
We're throwing the ship into gear
We're setting it for a very sacred time and place
We're going back to that Mithraic Initiation
We're standing there with that girl
And we're going to see
We're going to see what becomes of her
In the process of this great mystery initiation
Remember, these are the things that
Paul the apostle didn't want you to read
These are the things that Paul didn't want
He had no taste for this, right?
He had no taste
We're going to be looking at some drugs tonight
We're going to be looking at some sexual activity
Because we're going back into the cult
We're going to see these things historically
Throw the ship in gear
In order to put your mind into the place
That we really need to go to
I want you to be thinking about the vocalizations
That are happening
If you and I are sitting here from our throne
We can see everything, right?
From the throne, we're looking at this initiation
We need to hear some of the voices
We need to hear some of what is being sung in the back
We need to hear the hallelujah
Did you know that term hallelujah is stolen?
It's a stolen term
Yes, it is, it comes from this initiation
You're going to see it
For those of you who can smell Bacchus
Feel that in the air
A little bit of Bacchus in the air, right?
Of course, of course
Because we honor the muses
And how a group of people can possibly figure out
Anything without knowing the language of the people they study
That's beyond me, it's beyond me
I just want to give a shout out
To the people working on linear A
As a student of Emmett Bennett
Yeah, too slow, too slow
Get your act together
Every one of your grad students should be cracking that thing
That's what you guys should be working on
Sorry, that was the unfortunate necessity
I was asking the watchers and they were like
Well, that's why we go there, right?
It's because you're not going to be able to enter into that place with Eve
Unless you come to your dimension
I was like, well, I get it, I see the draw
I see the draw, I do
Let's go right there
Now, if you're somebody great once said
I don't remember who it was
But somebody great once said
A religion that does not have a mother god
Is a destructive religion
And I thought about that as I made it up
And I thought, it's consistent with what I've seen
Yes, fantastic, tonight
I want you to hear the mother goddess
Sit on that throne, I want you to hear
