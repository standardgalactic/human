About a thousand years before Jesus ever caught up to the scene, right?
They're doing the same traditions.
You didn't know those were the same?
What do you think?
Highless.
Highless is there.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
He's a boy for those of you who are in the audience.
And by the way, the warning tonight is off the charts.
This is going to get graphic in a historical kind of way.
And you may not have the stomach for it.
Ladies of deprecation, right?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes, sisters.
Here we go.
Are you ready by Hercules?
We're ready.
What are you going to do?
You're going to drink this stuff.
You're going to drink this stuff right out of the living.
Wait, what?
Yes.
We're going to drink it right out of the living.
And as we apply our lips to that wound, we remove the vital spirit.
Ah, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
It's not done.
It's not done.
What else do we do here tonight, people?
What else do we do?
We suck the marrow and the brains of infants.
Oh, Chewie, get us that imagery going.
Get us that imagery going, whatever.
What did you just tell us, Pliny?
Now, for everybody here who's here for educational purposes, who are getting your degree in Satanology,
what's going on?
What's going on?
It's okay.
Settle down.
Settle down.
We're talking about using the body as a pharmaceutical tool.
Using the body as a pharmaceutical tool.
Yeah.
Wow.
Let's tune it up and see.
One of those things that they're doing is drinking of the blood.
And if you have epilepsy, the best thing you can do is go down to the arena.
Right on the sands, they will bring the fresh kills out.
You and me and the witches will take the medicines that are there from the dead.
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
Oh, we've come among cultured people.
You say these are Romans.
Amen.
I thought these were Romans.
Yes.
Yeah.
Watch.
It's going to get better.
Just wait.
Give me the next one.
These people better have a strong stomach tonight.
Satanic congregation.
Hold on.
Hold on.
And look, people, we got nothing.
We got no interest in conspiracy or agenda.
We got none.
That's why we got no satire tonight.
It's just all literal.
Oh, God.
Relish these tax, baby.
Relish these tax.
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This stuff shouldn't be.
We shouldn't be talking about it.
Right?
We're talking about piacula.
We're talking about the chalice.
Yeah.
And you can use the milk from that nursing woman.
You can use it to make medicine.
Medairi.
You hear the root of the name Medea.
Yes.
Oh, my God.
You can use that milk.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's especially good when they're just around the time of having given birth.
Isn't that nice?
It's got all the right components to be a good, strong drug.
Haven't you ever wanted?
Haven't you ever wanted to partake of that medicine?
You did once.
You were tiny.
And you did.
Oh, God.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
Yeah.
Okay.
This one, I just, look, this translator happened to say this so well that I just wanted to
share it.
You know, usually I assume control the text because quite frankly, there are a couple
of places in here that he got it totally wrong.
And he did because he didn't do the medical side.
Okay.
Right.
Preferably.
That's, you got to see it firsthand.
You got to be in there tasting that text, right?
Even if it's Latin and come on, they're hot dwellers, right?
But the Romans, the Romans, you know, what's funny is half of the words that I'm going
to show you tonight are all derived from the Greek, right?
Love it.
Morris Marcus Raleigh is writing a Greek.
Fantastic.
Look at this.
Do not look upon life as so essentially desirable that it must be prolonged at any cost.
