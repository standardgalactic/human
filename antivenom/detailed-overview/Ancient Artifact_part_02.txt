Be it what it, be what it may and you who are of the opinion be assured whoever you may
be that you will die nonetheless.
What's the nonetheless for?
Because the people who were drinking the blood and eating the flesh, they are living longer.
And you and I have seen Marcus Raleigh.
Galen says, and you can tell he's on it.
You can tell he's on it.
Oh, oh, where are they?
Even though you shall have lived in the midst of obscenities and abominations, obscenities
and abominations.
Wow.
Is that what they're going to call it?
Is that what they're going to call it?
Look, people.
Let's get this straight.
When you step off that time machine into the middle of a cult of flesh eating vampires
who want baby brains, baby brains, brains.
You could use the woman who just produced as well as her fetus.
You could.
You could.
There's no satire.
I am not kidding you.
I am not giving you an argument.
I do not look here, both my hands.
Right?
There's nowhere on the dolly.
There's nowhere on the dolly that I am touching tonight.
That's it.
I'm giving you the sources for my fans who say that man is crazy.
I give you one response.
If she's not tired out, you didn't do your job, dummy.
Wow.
It's people.
I don't get it.
Let's hit the next one.
Go to the next source.
We need more of these vampires.
These are luscious.
I love these.
Okay, people.
Don't get ready to shock yourself, right?
Right?
Right here.
Blow that up.
Blow that up.
Look at the bottom line.
Incantamenta.
Carminum.
Incantamenta.
Pliny says, then there's the whole matter with these people of the enchanting evocations
of the powers that come through those portals, the daimonis.
Right?
What are we doing when we incant?
We are using poetry.
We're using song to bring to ourself a force, right?
To draw down those stars.
Right?
Beautiful.
Let's go to the next one.
Pliny says, look, this is all those magi.
Those drug-using magi, right?
They're the ones doing this kind of stuff.
They're going around picking out people.
You do this.
This is going to happen to you.
What?
Oh, this is lovely.
You didn't know Jesus was a vampire.
That's what's funny.
You didn't know Jesus Christ from Mark 14, 51, 52, the dude who was arrested in the public
park with a naked boy yelling, I'm not a child trafficker.
You didn't know he was in a vampire cult?
Yeah.
Didn't you see him resurrected?
Yeah.
Did you ever see him?
I dare you to do that.
I dare you to do that.
He shows up on the shore and his boat full of naked children is there.
If you don't believe me, go read the Bible.
Yes, my goodness.
This is a great era.
It's the opening of the scriptures.
I love it.
Let's go to the next source.
Okay, wait.
We're going back to Pliny.
Oh, are we already there?
Are we already there?
Hey, look at this.
26 observations on remedies derived from the flesh.
Eight remedies derived from kiddies.
People, look at what you're looking at.
Remedies derived from children.
Wow.
Do you know why?
Because sometimes the blood has different constituents in it.
And you don't want post pubertal blood if you are trying to treat disease.
That's why that stuff that's fresh that comes out of the uterus.
Boom.
That stuff is the best.
That's the highest quality.
Yeah.
Now, if you and I as Romans can penetrate to those ventricles,
Oh, you know what's there?
You know what's there?
Whoo.
Okay, let's go.
This is, this is fantastic history.
People, do you see what the Romans are doing?
Do you love this?
Oh God.
226 observations on remedies.
That's just derived from us.
How many ways do I have of producing your remedies?
Love that.
Next.
Next.
Okay.
Look, people, this is a long.
This is a long passage.
And I just want to, I'm going to read it real quick to you.
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this?
