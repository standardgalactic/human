Wait, we're not done.
And what does it do?
It helps with inflammation, helps with inflammation.
And you know what?
You can turn it into, um, a means of expelling your men sees.
Wait.
What?
Remember I told you guys that they were into programmed menstruation.
Yeah.
Believe it or not, women, when they get a chance, will program their own menstruation.
Makes sense.
I would.
Yeah.
Doesn't it?
It's smart thinking.
It's Bronze Age smart woman thinking.
Yeah.
And what are they going to do?
You can draw it down with a key and you can draw it down.
Right.
What else can you do?
You can burn your butt warts off.
Seriously.
Seriously.
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
Cause you know, they got condolomata in antiquity.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And that describes several different growths.
But one of them is, is an anal wart.
Don't you want to treat your anal warts?
Yeah.
Sounds good to me.
It's good medicine.
Um, what's the next one?
Oh, and for those, it, it, honestly, for those of you who have neuralgia, who have this,
this pain due to a nerve, you know what we do in that?
You doing that?
This stuff deadens that.
Oh, okay.
So we're going to start, you know, yeah.
And joints, joints.
Right.
Has some action on the joints.
Right.
I never knew boy sweat had such goodness in it.
Yeah.
But apparently it does.
Are you ready to heart?
Let's go harvest some more.
Let's go find these different things.
Blood.
We got blood there.
Right.
Jesus.
You're still with Jesus.
We got the blood in the flesh.
Jesus.
Right.
We got the naked boy that's with you.
Right.
You know, there was sweat on that naked kid.
You know, there was, if you can collect it, um, with a scraper or stridgel.
That's what they called it.
Um, with a stridgel, if you can collect that, um, you could also get it.
You could also get it off a living subject.
Couldn't you?
Yeah.
It would stand a reason.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Maybe that's, you know, one of the reasons that that kid was slippery, by the way.
Um, but notice that it's combined with oil.
So who knows what that's doing, you know, chemically.
What does boy sweat and oil do when you put them together?
You want to find out?
Go to a catechesis in antiquity.
Did you know they stripped those boys naked for those things?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
If you thought mother church was so innocent.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Why?
What do you tell them, by the way?
What is, what's the excuse that you give the kid after you traumatize him?
Um, he tells us in, what's his name?
Catechesis.
Mr.
Gogget.
Catechesis.
That guy.
Yeah.
I don't, I just, the doors closed at the end of the world.
Who cares?
Um, yeah.
And he's offensive.
Anyway, what is it that you do, um, when the kid who has been through this horrific
sexual abuse, what do you tell him?
Right?
Well, when he starts going through it, the first thing you tell him is, look, Jesus
hung on the cross naked.
That's why you got to get naked.
Isn't that clever?
Isn't, aren't, isn't Holy Father church, isn't that the, isn't that the cleverness?
That's the priestly cleverness of Christianity.
That's, that's clever.
You know, you got to give the Romans for resting them, right?
Uh, for doing this kind of stuff.
You got to give it.
You got to give it to the Romans, but you know, hey, they got, they tried to get by with
it.
Yeah.
Love it.
Let's go to the next source.
Now, before we do bring up some pictures and cause people's minds to do things.
Please, Chewie.
Um, look, I'm going to give you something now.
And this source is one that, um, I don't believe you'll have access to.
It'll come soon.
You know, if it, if it hasn't already, but last time I looked no access.
This is an insertion that was made into a text from the 12th century.
