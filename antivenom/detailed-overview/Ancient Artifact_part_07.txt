Fantastic.
Don't blow it up.
I got to see it again.
So what happens when a space of time is complete, they're putting the stuff on the nipples and
then they're feeding, breastfeeding and the one who's breastfeeding, you know, for a long
time, they're going to sit there and suck.
But when they get sustained, when they get full, they're going to fall off.
They're going to fall off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Next one.
Next one.
You can do some pictures.
Let me just say for a minute, what kind of world have we come to?
We've come to a world that has created democracy and science, scientific method.
We've come to a world where we have generations and generations and generations of an applied
scientific pharmacology.
We have refined the art to such a degree that we are now using body fluids.
We're using body fluids.
Whether they're of toads or of people is irrelevant, right?
Isn't that nice?
How many of those substances are still out there?
Let's keep, let's stay with ours, the ones that we got.
Okay.
We go to the next one.
Look at this.
Look at this.
What happens under the influence of this special milk?
What happens to these people that are taking that stuff where these little dudes, toadie
toads, they grow up.
They grow up.
They get big.
They swell.
They swell with that poison carrying juice.
Love it.
Did you know breast milk could carry poison?
That's a good way to go.
It's a good way to go.
What are you going to do after you're going to put it right into the vessels?
You're going to take that stuff and you're going to shove it right in.
You're going to what?
Oh my God.
Haven't you ever seen them?
All right.
You know they can remove blood too.
They don't have to.
Oh, I got to show them that one, right?
But look, on the next line here, I just want you to see that we got the snakes involved.
Calendry serpentes.
Wait, wait, what?
Yeah.
And we've got some aquatic snakes and what are these people doing?
What are these people doing?
What are these people doing?
They're combining the snakes with the toads now.
They're combining it?
Yeah.
And what do they feed them?
What do they feed them?
Remember Galen was feeding the roosters, the theriacs to see if the different snakes would
be able to kill them, right?
What are they feeding these things?
Human flesh cadaver, baby.
Look at that word cadaver there.
Last line.
Oh my God.
Serious.
Look, this kind of stuff.
Give me the next one.
This kind of stuff.
We don't have the science for this.
We don't.
We don't.
It's going to take, according to Hamilton, it's going to take another 10 friggin years
to develop the AI that can tell us what's going on with the chemistry.
Go.
Break it down.
You know, there's an asp.
There's a poison producing asp, he says.
It's a death-bringer in three kind of ways.
Right?
It's got that three-headed death.
And what does it do?
He says, well, its name escaped my mind.
I love that when I read this.
I'm like, you know, first of all, we don't know who this is.
Probably MAPES just added it to the text.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So here, you know, he's getting it from some kind of source.
And that's what a good classicist should work to do.
Track down now.
What is the source?
What's the vocab that he's using?
It's the same.
This is really a two-parter tonight.
This is part one.
And next Friday, we'll have part two, because this well is so deep.
Right?
You wanted these vampires, right?
This well is so deep.
I thought, you know, you assume the baby brain eating thing was the worst.
You know, we started with that.
Okay.
You ready?
Let's go.
What is it?
What does it say?
Oh, look, you know, there's, there is this asp, you know, it's just super poisonous,
right?
Whatever it touches, it causes, you know, irremediable burden, pain, plague.
Yeah.
It's a, you know, if anything touches it, right?
Just total corrosion, baby, right?
Just kills it, you know, even the ground, the ground where it's been in contact with
these things, doesn't grow the, doesn't grow the grain.
Yeah.
It doesn't.
There's no fruitfulness there.
You can even have these from the water type and the area that they're around and be bereft
of life, baby.
It'll be bereft of life.
Go.
Please blow it up.
