No, no.
Don't boo.
Don't boo for Adam.
Don't boo for Adam.
Just get him up here.
He's yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are untouchable.
Adam, you are untouchable.
So it was at this point in the conversation, the devil told me, I need you to take my
sweat and I said, what am I going to do with your sweat?
He said, you're going to drink it.
I said, what?
He said, you know, you're going to drink it.
And when you drink it, it will make you.
Can I say chewy?
Will the empire get us if I say horny?
Is that a, what's the scientific?
What's the somebody give me in the chat?
What's the side aroused maybe?
Yeah.
You know, like the, like they used to say in 1850, the Randy and the wanton.
I need you to be wanting tonight.
I need you to relax and unbutton and be wanting.
That's what I need.
Okay.
So we have our, did, did we get, did we get Adam up there?
Did we get a, yeah, good.
Okay.
That's our triangle.
And from that triangle due to the miracle of nature came twins having different daddies.
All right.
Okay.
Do you see?
Now this is not uncommon.
It happens all the time.
Right.
And everybody's talking about, it's special.
Don't, don't get me wrong.
It's a special thing.
But for the two to be born of the same womb who are of different seed, this is bronze
age, pharmacology, hyper ovulation.
Yeah.
It's gorgeous.
They're doing it.
You know, they use fetal tissue too.
Scrumped italyumptious.
The dragon eats that fetal tissue.
The dragon eats that fetal tissue.
And you thought these people were strange and foreign to you as moderns.
Okay.
Well, just, just wait, just wait.
Give me the, give it now that everybody's creeped out.
That's fantastic.
Give me the text that we're going to start with.
I'm going to start us off as a, in a deep dark pit.
Are you ready?
Let me just translate this to you.
And this is my message coming from James in the Bible.
This man quotes the Bible.
He does it backwards though.
Right.
Read it sometimes backwards.
Read it sometimes.
Trust me.
It all starts with the apocalypse.
Are you ready?
Come now.
You rich bastards.
Cry and weep.
Mourn.
Cause you have such garbage coming in your future.
You know what your wealth is done?
It's rotted.
It's rotted.
All those things you value, like your clothes rotted.
Your gold, your silver, your cash.
All is all poisoned.
It's poisoned.
It is a poison witness.
A poison witness.
And it eats your flesh like fire.
And you are storing up everything you can for the end.
Isn't that a gorgeous address?
You know what they did with the man who said that?
They threw him to his death.
Yes, they did.
It's never popular to criticize those who are driven by greed.
Do you think they've understood?
Yeah.
I know.
They know it's a prison.
I know.
We told them.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Oh, okay.
Give me the next source as soon as you get through the imaging, the mental imaging.
I only have a few slides tonight.
So I wanted to give you something really, you know, kind of personal.
Give me the next one.
What happens?
What happens?
God, we're back in Genesis, right?
We're going to read it backwards.
What did God do?
He blossomed man.
He blossomed people.
He blossomed the individual.
What did he do?
This is usually translated as create.
And that from a third grade level works.
But I'm going to show you.
Give me the next.
Give me what?
What is plosso?
It's not the word for create.
That's for you.
Right?
Plosso, this beautiful baby.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You modern Greeks.
You modern Greeks.
They're always going to say that, Chewie.
They're always going to be like that.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Presumption.
Give me the next text.
Here it is.
Generally, the mold form, right?
To mold or form by what?
Education or training, right?
What do you mold?
You mold your soul.
How do you mold your soul?
It says in Greek down here, you mold your soul with muthos.
With these strings of logoi.
You mold your soul.
Give me the next one.
And what kind of molding can you do in the world, people?
Now, we're going, it's not that deep, right?
