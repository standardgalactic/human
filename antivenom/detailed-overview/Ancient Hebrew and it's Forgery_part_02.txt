Look what we do.
Plosantes there on the end.
What is it paired with?
Risantes.
How are you surprised?
And it's referencing plastering and naon.
And what is a naon?
That is the inner chamber.
It can't just be a temple in general.
But it's the inner chamber also.
It's the place where the Edolon is.
Do you see?
They set up their temples as if they were mental images.
And that interior spot is the spot that holds your Edolon.
Your Edolon.
Gnostic informant is going to bring us some Edolon next week.
He happens to be off, go ahead.
He happens to be off doing things right now
that Hercules is always going to be up to doing.
So, hey, hey Gnostic, how you doing?
I hope you at least broke two or three dishes.
Where's that other pick we got him?
We got him something somewhere. Give it to me.
Give it to him. By the way, did anybody figure out who's on the thumbnail tonight?
There he is.
All right, Gnostic. Fantastic.
Put one back. Put one back.
Okay, don't drive. Be good.
Just break plates.
Tell them they're all Cretans. Tell them.
All of them. Hi, people.
You're all from Crete. You're all from Crete.
Fantastic.
It's liberating to find things out like that.
Give me the next one.
Look, this is the first deep dive.
What happens? God finished off the person, right?
Dust from the earth.
He finished him off that hoon.
What is that hoon?
It's that stuff that blows on the ground.
You can put it together with certain other things.
It makes some mental out of it. You know what I mean?
Concrete, right?
And what happened?
What happened? God in-natured into the face of this dude,
the breath of Zoe.
What was Adam's face doing?
It was being in-natured.
It was being filled with that natural power of the breath of Zoe.
The breath of life, right?
You can translate the breath of life,
but you have to remember that Eve is called Zoe.
Now, do you see the party that we've come to?
Right?
They ain't enabled. They didn't look anything like each other.
They did not look anything like each other.
You know what I mean?
You don't have to sacrifice when you look like you're dead.
You know what I mean?
Okay, let's not. It's too hot.
The mojo, lower the mojo. It's crazy.
Give me the next one.
Watch this, people.
God, now, this is translated.
Part of this is, look, I'm giving you the Greek,
but we're going to show you a couple of places
where the heat...
It is too powerful.
The mojo is too powerful.
Are we back, Chewie?
It's the jammers. They've got those imperial jammers, bro.
You've got to clear those up.
Okay, and look what the Lord God did.
Now, look here. Now, I'm going to introduce you to Lord God.
Are you ready?
This is not your fairy tale.
This is not some bright light.
This is not some entity pulsating invisible entity.
This is not... No, this is a dude in a place
where people acknowledge the existence of the gods.
I said that in the plural.
The existence of the gods.
Human history is polytheism.
Monism, like Judaism, Christianity, Islam,
those monist religions are aberrations
of a polytheistic cosmos.
Yeah.
So, what we're going to see here in this verse
is this Lord God who you think is,
No, dude, it's a kurio.
Do you know how many kurio there are in antiquity?
There's a whole bunch of them.
They're all over the place. This is just a position.
You thought, oh, it's the Lord from the void,
and the black is...
Right? Oh my God.
Do you know why?
Because you have been injected with philosophy
and theology right up your...
You know what?
You've been injected with it for a long time.
It's time to take that out.
It's time to get rid of that.
Suck that stuff out.
Just pull it out. Get it out.
Evacuate.
Get some kind of instrument.
What is he doing here?
Oh, the... Oh.
Where is he with his lamb?
Oh, God, it's so ridiculous.
Does anybody else see the ridiculous nature of this picture?
This dude never, ever, ever, ever existed.
There is no text to support that dude.
Never.
Sprinkle some kids around.
Maybe a couple of teenagers.
Make him touching them in like a crowd in the background.
Say, hey, stop touching those children.
And he's like...
Then you'd be with the right Jesus.
I don't know what that mess is.
Look, they all look like they have the plague.
That's what happens.
Neil's going to talk about that.
What happens when you suck the classical well dry?
What happens?
You get this.
Look at this.
Is this art even?
What is that?
It's like everybody's dead.
I can't take it.
Let's get out of this sector.
Quick, let's go back to the text.
There's got to be something good in there.
At least something dirty or something earthy.
You know what I mean?
Don't be creepy about it.
What did he do?
What did this individual do?
