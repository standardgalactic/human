It's way, way, way, way, way under-sophisticated in the class of the ancient Greek, right?
It's simple. It's just a simple machine. It's like, you know, this is basic programming.
There's nothing complicated stuff, right?
Okay, so here we go. It's not good for the man to help her. Give me the next one.
Give me the next one. What is King James? What is King James?
I heard King James had some situation going on. There's been a lot of that.
King James Bible and the Lord God said it's not good that the man should be alone.
I will make him and help, again, help.
Okay. Well, I can see where these guys are going.
They've all been messing around with the Masoretic text and that's been giving them this.
Look, what's the definition here of Ezir? What is it? Help. Yeah, right?
Okay, help. Now, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to show you what Eve actually is.
Are you ready? Give me the next one. Yep.
Oh, there it is. To help. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, that was the verb from which it was derived in Hebrew.
Look, what is this Boethos? What is this Boethos?
Look at that. The Dorian is Boethos. Isn't that nice?
You can hear it. That dude's from Athens, right?
Hasting to the cry for help. Do you know what Adam's doing?
Alright, first of all, his name. His name is not Adam, man from the earth.
His name is Invincible. And the one who makes him invincible is the Ewa.
Welcome to the mystery. Welcome to the mystery. Let's see what happens.
Let's see what happens. Oh, that's beautiful. Jack me. Oh, yeah.
Oh, Danny Jones. Look, there he is. Danny Jones.
Stand there. The iron. I can feel your iron. Jack me into the ancient drug matrix, baby.
Here we go. Here we go. Let's not disappoint Danny. He's got things to do.
Let's jack him in. Go. Give me the next one.
Yep. So look, it's an aiding or a helping or an assistant.
Look at the kinds of people. If you look through those Greek gems,
you're going to find it's a lot of military stuff.
As a matter of fact, it's kind of got a military kind of theme to it.
Okay, give me the next one. This is militaristic. This is fantastic.
What else is Eve? The first part of what she is comes from this word in Greek, boi.
And it's the loud cry. Look at the door in boi.
Boi. Boi. It's a shout.
Mostly a battle cry. Mostly a battle cry.
Look, look, look. Sound of musical instruments. The roar of the sea.
Oh, I see. So it's got a little bit of range. Just taste it.
Taste it. As you're trying to discover the technical nature of ancient Greek vocabulary,
what you do is you sample all the different vineyards in the countryside.
You want to know what that region is good for? Sample them all.
And that's what we're doing. That's what those Brits, those Victorian Brits,
helped us to see was so important when you're performing classical philology.
Yes. Oh, I love it. So what we're doing is you form a word from the fine nuances
that it takes on and pretty soon you can see the core. You can see the core.
Okay. So when you're reading one of these texts and some Greek is making up words,
right, coining new words. And those aren't in the lexicon.
You can follow that. Do that. Path. Oh, God. Tenth Muse, baby.
Order of the Rose. Don't you love it? Okay, let's go. We got more drugs slinging here.
Look at this, people. Boi Thea is helper aid. But look at number two.
Medical aid or cure, right? Cure. So these are drugs we're talking about.
Drugs. Yes. Fantastic. Fantastic. Assistance. How are drugs relevant?
They're assistance. They allow you to go from one place to another,
from a place of weakness to a place of strength. Love it.
Now, if you just heard the name, the secret name of Rome, you'll understand.
You brought a Nias, don't worry. We're going to get, we're going to give Virgil.
Watch. Command Sybil. Come on, baby. Hit it. Hit me with that next one.
This is most enlightening. But what is a Boi Thema? It's a resource, right? A remedy.
And that's where I see it most is on the medical side, right?
Because they talk about these things that, you know, plant substances, animal substances,
that are these remedies, right? Okay. All right. Let's go to the next one.
Notice diascortes and Hippocrates. We're both down there for you,
nearer to or into the medical side. Now, wait, this woman, right?
What's she going to be called? What's she going to be called?
What's she going to be called? She's going to be called woman because she was taken from the man.
Yeah. Because she was taken from the man.
Now, remember, I know we talked about the Satanic congregation.
We talked about this, but I want to reemphasize it.
Hit me with the next one. We're going to, we're flying tonight.
We talked about the Wir Ago. Remember, in Hebrew, it doesn't work.
We can't call her woman taken from, removed from the man when all it is in Hebrew is ish and isha.
It's a masculine form for person and in a feminine form, right? That's it.
Feminine marker on the end. That's it. That's it.
Okay. So it doesn't work.
The problem is the Greek doesn't work either.
The Greek doesn't work either because it's goon and uneer, right?
Neither of those are related or fulfill the taking from, right?
The one taking from the flesh of another.
Oh, wow. It's starting to get good, right?
Hang in there with me. Hit the next, but we know what does it work?
What's the, keep that up. What is the one language it works in?
It works oddly enough in Latin, Wir Ago, which is literally just taking from the man.
Yeah. Isn't that something from the masculine?
Oh, that's, that's fantastic from the force. Can also mean that force.
Watch this. A man like vigorous heroic maiden.
Do you know any man like vigorous heroic maidens?
Do you know any female warriors?
I'm sure some of you, if you're blessed to be in the Marine Corps, for example, I bet you know.
I bet you know some men like vigorous heroic maidens.
I bet you do. I bet you do. Look at the vigorous stout.
Look, we can find vigorous stout maidens. That's no problem.
Look what they're referring to here. These are their God's people, Minerva, right?
She's one of these. Diana is one of these. Jutana is one of these with her sacred springs, right?
She's one of these. And who do we see at the bottom?
Who do we see at the bottom? Well, we see an Amazonian woman first because you know,
Amazonian women are that way, right?
You're going to get your butt kicked, totally kicked.
And the tech, if their tech doesn't blow you away, they will physically blow you away.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Back to that. Who is at the bottom of the list?
Who is at the bottom of our list? Bring that one up again in a second.
But who is at the bottom? I want you to see Eve is at the bottom.
