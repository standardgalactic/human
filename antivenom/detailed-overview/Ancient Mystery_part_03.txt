Eve is at the bottom because she was taken from man.
She was taken from man. And what was her purpose there?
There's a boy on her purpose was to make that SOB invincible.
Yeah. How do you do that? You got to burn something off, baby, and you're going to end up naked.
Oh, seriously. Did you see the devil?
Oh God, let's go. Give me the next one. Give me the next one.
Everybody knows that's what that's what it's about.
Yes, people. What is the?
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. So the the weird go.
Where's the weird go? Where where is she?
She's the maiden. What is the Virgin, by the way?
I just wanted to define here the Virgin.
Look at some of the people that it's talking about by the way, Palace and Diana again.
We're following the same astrea at the bottom.
Did you see astrea? Who's she daughter of dawn?
You dawn bringers, right? This is right in your wheelhouse.
This is right where we operate and function. Everybody in Satanic congregation.
This is the Virgin. This is the Virgin. They called her the Star Virgin, right?
Do you understand? Somebody had a dream.
Medea and this is recorded in flakas.
Medea had a dream and in that dream there was a constellation on her chest.
There were stars, right? And those stars are what moved her.
She is that star Virgin. Yeah. Okay.
What you're hearing is Vox. You're hearing the Orphic voice.
Everybody, right? On the throne.
Give me the next one. We're calling her up. Are you ready?
People aren't going to believe it when they see the switch.
Where are we going? Let's pull up a dead Roman and say,
what's the value of all this, right? We're in the middle of the right.
We're getting into the, we're getting into that medication.
We're going deeper into the death and resurrection.
And we're getting to the point that we are prophets.
One of your prophets. Some one of your prophets.
You know who said that first, Paul? The one who said that first was the Medea.
The one who said that first was Medea. She's the one who made your rights, Paul.
She's the one who made your rights. Are you ready to show it?
In order to do that, we've got to bring up one of the echelogues, right?
And a priestess.
Priestess. Who's the priestess here? Look, now has come the last stage.
Oh, get the English off there. Bring up the next one.
Did I put the Latin? Boom. No, I didn't.
Go down. Yeah, it's down here. There it is.
What have we come to, people? The final, I'm telling you what this Latin says.
And this, by the way, is the prophecy.
The prophecy that the Christians were so interested in.
Okay, what are we talking about? We're talking about that coming star.
That coming star. Do you know who she is? Everybody says,
He says,
It's probably, you get some nerd. It's probably a comet.
Right? No, it's Fox Orphica, you moron.
Right? It's her. It's her.
She was in the temple on the purple and pregnant.
Whose father was the child Zeus?
That's how you say God in Greek.
Nice. Love it.
Somebody here, give me this.
Sisters of frustration. Come here, please.
Naughty. You're all naughty.

It's a Friday night. They want to see the drugs.
You all came for the drugs. Give me the next one, please.
Yeah, there it is. So, what am I going to give you tonight?
Here's the gift. Are you ready?
The final age of the Cumaean song is here.
It's here now. Now.
Now is the great ladder of the ages.
Sprung anew. Already.
The virgin returns and the Saturnian rule is restored.
Now. Now has come the new offspring sent down from heaven.
Oh, God. Oh, God, you mean this is before Jesus is walking around?
This is why they call the earliest Christians, Sybilists.
It's Sybilists. There's a couple of things they call the early Christians.
And we're going to see that in a second.
They call followers of the way.
They call them Sybilists and they call them atheists.
They call them atheists because they have no gods.
They don't have justice, right? She's the last one to abandon any civilization.
She's the last one to leave.
When you turn completely to the monest gulf of swirling detritus in pollution.
When you've gone that route, there's no way out.
There's no way out without purgation, right?
Here we are. Here we are.
Give me the nice. Give me the next one.
Oh, here. Okay. Now I'm going to feed it. Watch this.
So Achilles. Who is this?
Oh, it's that. Faudis again.
Achilles. What did he do?
What did he do? He was called Purisos.
Right? Purisos.
Yeah. And why is he called that?
Because his mother pulled him out of the fire when he was burning.
And what does that Purisos mean?
What does it mean? It means one plucked from the burning.
Who is this? This is Achilles.
His mother. His mother is performing the purification that makes Adamas,
that makes you invincible, invulnerable.
She is doing it.
Okay. Oh, I thought it was just Purisos and temples.
No, no, no.
She is doing it when the Da Maitre does it.
She's not doing it in a temple. She's doing it in a home.
Yeah. Fantastic. Fantastic.
