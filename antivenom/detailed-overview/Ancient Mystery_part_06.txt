These are pure classical streams.
This is the stuff that causes renaissance, enlightenment.
This is the stuff that causes democracy to be reborn.
That's what this stuff is.
Oh, my God.
It's lovely.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
That was my patriotic moment.
What else is Dionysus?
He's crowned with the snakes.
Wait a minute.
You mean they've got baskets.
These women have baskets of dildos and snakes.
They're wearing snakes.
Yes.
And they're putting the snake venoms in their hair.
Yes.
Right.
And they have purple stained lips.
Yes.
And they're wearing the ivy.
Yes.
Are these Cretans?
No, they're not Cretans, but they're close.
They're close.
We're really close in Idumea.
Oh, Tacitus, bring us the truth.
Bring us the truth.
We don't want the truth.
Take your truth and shove it.
We have sources.
That's better.
Hit me with a source.
Give me the next one.
Dionysus says what?
He says, look, he's pissed at the end of the play.
And if people, I have students tell me this all the time.
By the way, this is from Euripides, Bacchai.
And people always tell me, students that I read this with, always tell me, they're
like, hey, why is Dionysus so angry when the indie shows up?
And he's like, hey, you all deserved it, right?
We just watched a mother rip off the head of her son.
Why did she do that?
Because this guy, he couldn't look into a mirror and see himself.
So he ended up getting his head torn off.
Yeah, don't look back.
They told him, don't look back.
Oh, God, are you ready for this?
What does he say?
He says, look, and you, Cadmus, you're going to become a dragon.
You become a what?
You can become a dragon, a serpent.
And your wife, and here it's a damar.
So it's a, it's not really wife.
It's more like you're, you're weird.
I'll go your boy thong that, that Amazonian who stands next to you.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
What is she?
She is going.
That's what it says.
She's going completely beast.
And she's what?
She's changing.
What's she going to change her form?
It's going to change into that of an office of an office.
That sounds familiar.
I think I've seen one of those.
Remember the devil in the garden, right?
She's going to change her form into the serpent.
And what's going to happen when she changes her form?
By the way, people, remember we're going through initiations.
And now we're at the point because we're seers that we're changing ourselves into
dragons, into dragons.
And what are these?
How are we going to do that?
Watch this, baby.
We do that because the dragon is the most thinking of all the beasts.
Oh, do you see what's happening?
Do you see what's happening?
Engage your brain.
Get on your throne.
Get through the fumigation.
Engage your brain.
And we'll bring you to the place of the dragon.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Next one.
Look, people, I just want to repeat this.
I want you to see that we're in that age.
Give me the next one.
We're in that age.
I'm going to translate it for you now from the Latin.
Just one more time.
Look, this is the final age of the Sibyl song.
The great ladder of the ages is now sprung forth.
Already the virgin returns.
And the Saturnian rulership is being reestablished.
Now a new offspring is coming from the heavens.
Are you ready?
We followed your star, said the magi.
