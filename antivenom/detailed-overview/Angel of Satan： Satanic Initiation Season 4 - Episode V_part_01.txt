Some of you just wanted me to hurt St. Paul the Apostle gratuitously
Those of you who have given me those comments
You should be ashamed of yourself
However, I will indulge you

He's been smelling angels' middle fingers too much
What do we do in all seriousness?

That sting, that sting is an angelos
Wait, wait, what?

Has anybody read the apocalypse lately?
By the way, I'm taking all the stuff from the apocalypse
These are all texts, this is your Bible
Because we're storming, we're storming your Bible college
We just stormed into a Bible college
We kicked the doors down
We stripped naked, every professor there and lined them up
We walked in, we took their Greek texts
We said, these are our chumps and we walked out with it
They belong to us now
They belong to us

It's an angel of Satan
Because it's the form of the word
Oh, it doesn't say
It says it is Satan
Oh, do you like that?
Do you like that?
You thought, you thought you understood the universe
You were living in
You thought you knew who the devil was, didn't you?
Didn't you know?
No, no, no, no
Thank you, Sebesius, man
Holy mackerel

He's got an applicator
That will take him to the third uranos
And when he's there
Bum, bum, he gets the visions
