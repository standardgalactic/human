Satan, bro
Did you know Paul the Apostle had Satan in his brain?
That's too much
You didn't
Because you have lived in Disneyland all your life
And you follow fairy tales
And you have buildings where you walk into the buildings
And they repeat the fairy tales
And they give you some this and some that
And none of it is the Christian mystery
None of it, I can tell you for a fact
Take it, take it from the board
The board of Lucifer and Co
Yeah, the mystery is not being performed
Do you want to know what it is?
That guy that was jacking himself with purple?
Yeah, he knew, he'd been there
He'd seen the things that can't be repeated
With mortal speech
With mortal tongue
Things that can't be repeated
Yeah, he'd seen them
And he knew
He knew, let's dial him back up here
We've got to get some more Greek in here before these people get bored
Right?
Yeah, what's he going to do?
He's going to go to that paradise here
We'll see that Padaeus on there
Oh, that says, I'm not making it up folks
It's right there in your text
He's getting the areta remata
Right, the things that can't be repeated
Those not just newspaper clippings
Or not just headlines
Or not just ancient scroll labels
None of that
None of that, this is the good stuff
This is the good stuff
He is snatched away via his burning purple
Isn't that nice?
Love it, oh god, the drugs are getting
Wait, there's more, there's more drugs to come
We need more drugs than this?
Yes, we do
If we're going to have the apocalypse
We need a lot of drugs, sorry
Let's bring up the next one, yeah
So what was given to him was a skullops
And that is his Angelo satana
Okay Paul, keep Satan in your head
And let's keep going
Look at this, this is from the Mithras Liturgy
I just want you guys to look at the third line down
This is 575, like that
Yeah, sige, sige, sige, right?
That's your log off that you're supposed to speak
Ego, Amy, sum planos, sum min astir
I am the wandering star with you
With you, she's addressing those seven
Keep your eyes on those seven stars
Your anchor is that fugater
That daughter who is in the Mithrait
Right, that's your key
Keep your eye on her, right?
Because what is she going to do?
Kai ek dubafus an alampon
Because she's going to come out
She's going to, what does it say?
Turn it off, she's going to
come out
She's going to return
She's going to return from where?
From the depths, from the depths, bro
Now you don't know where that is, right?
You don't know where that is
Because we're talking about dimensions
We're talking about the seen and the unseen, right?
Okay, evangelicals, you guys should have been
saying, yep, yep, we know, we know
That's the way to, do you know what happened?
I put Paul with Isaiah, the next thing
Isaiah had a big smile on his face
I don't know what's going on
I don't know, but you got to keep those
You got to keep that from turning into something
You know, where it gets out of hand, right?
Excellent, let's go, let's go to the next
Hey, right here under that text
I just want to give you a few words here
Yeah, can we blow that up? Fantastic
So I can get to, oh, this is burning, man
Look at this, this is what's going on
In the eyes of Jesus
In the eyes of Jesus
He touched me, he touched me, right?
Oh, he touched me, right?
Show me where he touched you on the dolly, right?
Jesus touched me with his burning eyes
He's got flocks poor in his eyes
Does everybody here realize that?
The risen, the risen, take it down for just one minute
The risen vampire Jesus, right?
He who was dead, he who became necros
He is the living flame
He has the flocks in his eyes
He has the flocks in his eyes
Okay, right there, right in front of him
Right in front of him, bringing him right to you
Are you there in the right?
Okay, you're going to hold on
You're going to get a little turbulent here
Bring this up, make me bigger
Well, notice that it means to light up, right?
To light up, to burn or blaze
As in a torch, and then at the very bottom
