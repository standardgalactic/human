And all of their drugs
And now we're getting drug after drug
And the stars and the me getting boosted up
Into the third uranos, the third heaven
Right?
It's a dirty, dirty party of drunkards
That's what it is
Did you ever notice that Peter, James, and John
Those three knuckleheads that were supposed to keep watch
While Jesus was with the naked kid
In the public park?
You know, at 4 a.m.
Did anybody notice that those three dudes
Kept falling asleep?
Yeah
Did anybody notice that the text says, and Mark says
Jesus is confused?
He's bewildered, bro
We got a dazed and confused Jesus
Strutting around in a public park
It's a cemetery at 4 in the morning
With the naked kid
And his guards fell asleep
Did you ever want to ask yourself
Next time you're in evangelicals
Next time you're in Sunday school
Ask your pastor or your Bible teacher
Right?
Even if you're, you know
Even if it's your, you're in junior Bible study
Right?
Doesn't have to be anything serious
Just approach your authority
And ask them
Ask them about that moment
Ask them about
Why are these guys all on drugs?
Why is one of them?
Why is Jesus calling himself a job
Trafficker?
Why is he doing this?
Right? Ask them
They won't know because kiddies
Because they follow the fairy tales
Right?
We're born and bred
In our land of the mouse
Our land of the
Of the great mouse of entertainment
Yeah, right?
So we follow our fairy tales
This one's a little bit darker
Right?
The actual history is
It's always more interesting
The fairy tale, you knew it
When you were reading it
You knew it
You were like, this stuff doesn't make sense
Right?
Well, okay here
We're here to show you what it actually was
So it will make sense
Go ahead
Bring the next one up
Now what comes out of the throne?
Okay, I'm going to say this
This is the climax
That I was hoping to get to with everybody
Okay, so hold on
Hold on, is anybody in the audience
Talking about the coming drugs?
This is fantastic
Okay, here we go
Are you ready?
The throne
Is the drug
In its compound form
And when you get the drug
What does it give you?
Here we have a description
Consistent across text
Including our Greek magical papyri
This is the same stuff that you guys
Saw in the Mithras liturgy
Right?
Same actions
What does the drug do?
What does the drug actually do
When you're sitting on the throne
This is fantastic
Let's go to the text
And see what the drug
Same text that we were just on
See what the drug does
From that throne comes
Astrapai
Astrapai
Kyfonai
Kybrontai
Oh my God
Phonai
Let's start with that
Voices
Voices
From the throne
Of Lady Babylon
Comes the voice
Love it
Love it
Gorgeous
Go back to the text
What else?
Astrapes, right?
Astrapai
Oh my God
