With God
None of us believed her
So now we've got to sit through
The whole play
Isn't that gorgeous?
Oh my God
That's what comes out of the throne
Lightning
Lightning comes from the throne
And what else?
There's one more lightning
And voices
And
Brontae

Oh dude
Dude, he's a world that sees
He's a monster

Of this cosmos

His vision is the future
And the past
At the present
That's what you call
A cycle

Give me your lightning
Bathe me in your lightning
And with that
The initiates enter into the death
Behold
I have the flocks pulled
In my eyes

Let's keep going with the text
You're gonna be surprised when it all comes out
You're saying, wait a minute
These classical texts are overlapping with the Bible
Yes, yes, welcome
Right?
No, they weren't beams there
But a foreign planet
Right?
Out of context
No, give us back that passage, Chewie
Yeah, yeah
And from that throne
Right?
And from that throne is this burning fire, dudes
It's this burning source of light
Yeah, and what is all of that?
That's the seven plummeta
That's the seven spirits
In my hand
Seven stars
In my hand, seven stars
Yeah, okay
Okay, let's keep going
Go down to the next text
We're almost done
I made this go so long, people
And what did this angel do?
Now, for those of you who were thinking, okay
I'm too deep into this narrative
I'm gone
I don't know where I am
I forgot that we were at a ritual
I forgot there were novitiates
I forgot that there was an initiation
Right?
I'm losing the picture
For those of you who are at that place
Let's just go back to what's actually happening
And that's what this text gives us
This angelos, right?
