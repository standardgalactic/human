This angel, he did what?
He grabbed up some libanoton
Right?
And a lot of people, a lot of the translations
Will give this to you as some kind of sensor
Or something to burn something in
Yeah
Only because it's post after the fact, right?
So he took some libanoton
And let's just look at what libanoton
Says frankincense
Yeah, frankincense
Guess what?
The magi are still there, people
Can you smell them?
When that magi came in and farted
Everybody smelled it for a week
Right?
That's the place we are historically
Here's the frankincense with him
Right?
And look at, it also means
Look at the very bottom, number three
Libanotris
What is it?
Libanotris
Well, I told my
I'm telling all of my Greek students
Right?
That everything in Greek
Can, goes back to some verb
Right?
They're verb heavy
For deriving words
And developing concepts
So it's very verb heavy
You just go back to the verbs
And see, what does it mean to
To libanotrisos something?
It means to fumigate it
With frankincense
To fumigate it
And what does it fumigate?
Remember the Sylians?
They don't take baths
They take, they fumigate themselves
With cannabis
Right?
Isn't that nice?
And who did we read?
A couple of days ago
Who did we read?
Was the origin of fumigation?
Who do they say was the origin of fumigation?
That was Semiramis, right?
So we're performing something
They were doing, they were doing
The queen of Babylon was doing, right?
The Medwa was the queen of Babylon
She is fumigating you
Fumigating you
Let's go back to the text
Yeah, and, um, no
Next one down
No, did we miss?
Where was that one?
We were just at
Here, leaving them out
Okay, um, yeah
So, yeah
I want you guys to see
That this frankincense is a big part of the picture
And it gets so crazy
That the frankincense is used
To be able to see the future
So there are libanomanes
There are mantics
Who are entering a frankincense mania
A frankincense mania, right?
Okay
And, um, that's because
They've been fumigated one too many times
And libanomana is really the grain
Now here, we're going to crack something
Those of you who are going to say
Oh, oh, this is Hebrew
Oh, manna is Hebrew, right?
You fell into the same trap, right?
There you are in Desaad's palace
And he's got you down there
He's got you tied up
He's doing things
You got to take what's in that bowl
That the priest pushes out into the hallway
You got to take what's in that
And give it to the other guy
And the other guy will smear it all over his body
And, um, you know, it's a thing
It's a thing
Welcome to the world of Desaad
Those of you who thought that was the picture
Manna
Manna is not a Hebrew word
It's a Greek word that was there before
The earliest proto-Hebrew
Yes, but you only believed it
Because you took the Masoretic path
You followed King James
Even if you didn't care, right?
It's just the way you were pushed
So, yeah, one of those
What is manna?
Manna is actually a granular form
It's a type of...
When you take the drug
And you can break it into a powder
