You can prepare it as a powder
Some kind of granule
In order to burn those, right?
That's what they're talking about with that manna
So, the frankincense manna
Is simply that powdered frankincense
And if we can put back up a couple more
Let's...
From where we were
Put it where we were
Good
Look at what this is
Libanomontis
What's a Libanomontis?
You didn't believe me when I said this
But here this person is
One that divides from the smog of frankincense
So, these magi that were high
Right?
Because all magi are high all the time
Right?
What do they do for...
What do they do for Jesus?
They're giving him the drugs that he will need
To kick himself
Into uranos
To be that son
You know, you see how it works?
You can't be the Christo
Somebody this week was telling me
That a classicist told them
It turns out this person wasn't a classicist
Anywhere, they're a New Testament scholar
Right?
And a New Testament scholar
Who's been reading Josephus
Did somebody just crack one?
It smells like dirty rotten onions in here
Sulfur
Purify this place, bro
Right?
When I hear somebody's read Josephus
Or translated Josephus
I smell the fart of eggs
Yeah, I do
When somebody quotes Josephus
What you need to do is realize
An angel just farted in your face
Yeah
Right in your face
It's not funny
It's not funny
It's not
You can stop angel farting
Okay
Alright
We have to do the Greek
And this person was saying
Christ, it just means to be rubbed with oil
Mashiach
Right?
It starts quoting some things that are not in the text
And have nothing to do with the words
No
The Greeks, if this guy had read more than Josephus
He would know
That alepho is the common word
For rubbing oil into somebody
Right?
Chrio comes originally
From the word that means to be stung by the gap fly
When you have the thorn in your flesh
You are invincible
You are invincible
And you have that oracle of Jehovah
You've got his oracle
You've got that place open
Right?
Next thing you know
You'll get the flocks in your eyes
You'll get those brazen feet
You'll get those brazen feet
What's he doing with those brazen feet, right?
You know, it's
We need to realize that this is people or people
And that what we've got is a cult
Full of drugged out sex maniacs
And once you come to those
That understanding
When you see those parameters of what your religion is
It kind of makes a lot more sense
Yeah, it makes a lot more sense
And all of a sudden, those funny odd passages that have what
We don't really translate them
Shame on you people
Shame on you scholars
That you didn't give this information
Okay, do we have any more texts?
We're going awfully long
I just want you to see that this mania
Can also just come from another oyster
Another sting
Another gadfly
Right?
How did she prophesy?
She prophesies your honor through the power
Of that oyster
Now wait, bring that back up
I want everybody to see this
Look at, if you look up mana
Right?
You'll get right away
A division, A and 2
And one of them appears to be
Based upon really hardcore Greek texts
Look at the first one that's mentioned
