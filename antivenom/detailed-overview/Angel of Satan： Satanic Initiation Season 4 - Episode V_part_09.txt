Diascortes
He's a doctor
Who deals in drugs
He writes about drugs
That's his thing
Look at Hippocrates is in here
Using it
Orabaceous
That's the personal physician of Julian the Apostate
Look Galen
That's the personal physician of Marcus Aurelius
So this word is used from an older Greek meaning
Which then they had to, the Victorians had to say
Wait a minute
We know that half of us are Bible scholars
And they're going to want to say
This is from Hebrew
Garbage
Garbage
Garbage, I define you to find me a word in English like that
No, it has magical roots in a different language
No, no, no, that's just bad linguistics, bro
That is just appropriation from the Maserites
Right?
This has got to be the holy Hebrew
Hebrew has got to be the holy language
You can't be not the oldest
Right?
It can't be
And if it makes you feel any better
You want to trace those roots through Babylon
Through Ur
No, no, no, dude
Dude
This mystery is being performed before
Before your people
And before the people that came before your people
Yeah, this is old
This is old stuff
Right?
So if you're going to argue
If you're going to argue linguistics
Don't use the ones that are made up
Don't use the tools that are made up
Get the science going
Did you see how that word men is used
Within the medicine?
Did you see all those doctors I just showed you?
Guess what?
Bible scholars don't read
They don't read this stuff
You are getting information
That nobody else is getting
This opens up a reality
That you didn't know was there but is
Yeah
We just went into their citadel
We knocked everything down
Right?
Get off that
Get off that guardian
I can see him over there
I can see everybody
We'll just burst in like a bunch of mean ads
We'll take our clubs
And we'll just bust everything to pieces
Yeah, turns out
Christianity
Turns out you are based
In sexual gratification
While under the influence of mind altering drugs
Your master entered into death
For the sake of being revived
Yes
A bunch of dirty cultists
You'll never wipe off that stain
Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park
With a naked boy
Tonight we got the thorn in the flesh
We have the messenger of Satan
We have Satan himself
Providing us with that
Oracular voice
What do I want to see from that throne?
I want to see the lightning
I don't want to hear voices
This is gorgeous people
We're getting there
We're getting there
And with a little bit more deep diving
You will be able to assemble all of the drugs necessary
For your own Christian mystery
Yes, yes
For the next time we meet
We will be looking at our ability
To revive the mystery
And we're going to do that
By looking at people who have done it in the past
And who wrote about it
And wrote about the experience
And the people who entered into it
And the people who didn't like them
The people who tried to shut them down
So we'll get a little bit of the history of the mystery
That's what we'll get
Thank you for your time tonight
I appreciate it
And I want to remind everybody that Zane Campbell
Is seeing the songs of our Satanic initiation
Is right now working on a new song
About Jesus and a naked boy in a public park
Thank you for coming tonight
Everybody have a good weekend
Hail Satan
Go ahead and drink and whiskey
Oh, yeah
