I'm back from my secret mission.
Whisper in, dance with the musicians.
Toxic venom, it be a kiss.
Stance into the bank, cash and checks.
Cracking whips, Athena with a dark tip.
Maltese island, sacred drift.
Catherine of the water, purple amethyst.
She could be a plus one on the list.
Bumping tracks in the ride, dark harbor.
High tide, all wheel drive.
Pocketing with the theory act.
Pauling from India, we throw pedophiles to the lions.
I'm with a rogue group of Roman rebels,
who make rope and fashion crosses.
The root cutters with the black arrows.
But to your dragon queen,
snake with your darkest dreams.
Come to your history,
dance with the musicians.
But to your dragon queen,
snake with your darkest dreams.
Come to your history,
dance with the musicians.
Thank you for coming back.
It's so nice to be here with you tonight,
because I have some special things
that I'm going to share with you tonight.
A couple of big announcements,
and then we're going to throw some sources in there
that are going to lay the foundation
for the Renaissance.
I love this. I love this.
I wanted to tell you about who I spent some time with.
I just got back from a secret mission.
I just got back from a secret mission.
And that secret mission
involved my meeting.
Danny Jones.
And what an amazingly cool character.
This guy is dense as iron.
He is a solid.
He's an earthy metal.
This guy, you could fashion a sword out of Danny Jones.
And I thought he was the best interview
I have ever had.
He is a magnet
for the music song.
And he did his research, man.
He read the whole chemical muse.
Danny, if you ever see this,
if you're doing that,
there's nothing better
than having your work critiqued
by someone of your level of cognition.
It's nice. It shows me.
Love it. Love it.
It was a wonderful experience.
And this guy, Danny, is so cool.
I'm serious. He's right at the top.
I had the best day of my life, man.
I told him that.
And he will be, you know, he and Chewie, right?
His Chewie is Steve with a pH.
And these are two of the most aggressively
renaissance characters that I have ever seen in my life.
This is fantastic.
The watchers are going to be watching and saying,
my God, man, what have you done?
Right? It's just the perfect combination.
Oh, we have such good stuff.
We have such good stuff.
So Danny read the whole chemical muse,
and then he came in and said, you know,
he wanted to ask questions, tough questions.
What were you doing when you were a teenager?
Yeah. Yeah, stuff like that.
Good questions.
He tracked where, you know,
the education was coming from, right?
And so, by the way, there will be two versions of this.
I've made it, you know, so far to where, you know,
how it is, we got to discuss the dirty stuff.
All you Satan, all you Satan worshipping people,
you know what I mean?
Oh, by the way, that was his first question.
That was his first question.
What do you mean by Hail Satan?
Yeah, I love it.
I love it.
So this was a great, a great opportunity
that I'm very thankful for.
And it'll be released in a YouTube form.
That is the Disney version.
Right? It's not actually Disney,
but it's the form that we got up to before.
I just couldn't take it anymore.
Everybody knows how I am, right?
Yeah, just got to let it go.
I got to get it out there.
And I said some things there with Danny
that I've never said and discussed
because I'm an open book.
I'm an open book, right?
Everybody knows that. Everybody knows.
So this should be fantastic.
And I think that there will be enough for you,
my Satanic congregation.
There will be enough of a fresh look there
for material that I ended up taking like 80 overhead,
you know, 80 passages out there, right?
But we ended up in the middle of a tornado,
a tornadic storm with the sirens blaring
