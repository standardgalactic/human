No, he was important enough to have assigned underage naked slaves.
Did Jesus have money?
It's funny.
He always appears poor.
I think your picture is wrong because here he's got enough power that he's assigned his
own naked boy slave and there's, there's, you know, we can go into length about what
that privilege is when you've got to have that, you know, when you've got that money.
Like Jesus isn't doing this in the palace, right?
He's not watching, he's not watching his wife's daughter, his stepdaughter.
He's not watching her dance naked in a dark back alley somewhere, right?
He's not watching that.
He's in the palace and all the big wigs are there.
This is entertainment, brah.
And she comes out and dances so good.
He says, I'll give you anything.
No, this is Jesus and he's back in the park, right?
With people, three of his boys watching, guarding at a distance.
Yes.
Everyone's like, we know this, sir.
Okay.
Keep going.
Don't call me, sir.
Not even, no, back to the, no, no, no, get that off there.
Ah, Christy Anglo.
Okay.
Ah, look.
Altoy pedibe, menos, having wrapped up a scene donor, which we all know what that is.
It's a bandage.
And then those next two words, epigumno, on his private parts.
Yeah.
And chai cratus in alto and they arrested him.
So there was some young guy assigned to Jesus and some young guy had his genitals wrapped
in a medicated bandage.
Yes.
And they arrested him.
This is when they're arresting Jesus, right?
And what happens next one?
Oh, look what happens here, people.
Look, look what happens.
A young man.
Look at the transformation of the new international tonight, we're going to beat to death.
The new international version, which is probably as useful as, oh, I don't know, um, as a model
T.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Probably about that useful and practical now.
Right?
Here for a museum.
That's okay.
But yeah, I'm not taking one all night in, right?
Um, that's what this thing is doing is distorting a young man.
No, it's not a young man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A young man.
Oh, how about where'd you get the man out of that?
There's nothing in nanniescos.
That's man.
Naya means fresh, fresh, a little, freshy nanniescos.
It's a diminutive, a little, freshy.
And so a young man, he sounds more distinguished.
They've distinguished him up, wearing nothing.
Listen, wearing nothing incidentally, but a linen garment, a linen garment.
Seriously?
Okay.
He was following Jesus when they seized him, right?
Like just following.
What is this?
Get out.
Just wandering aimlessly.
Right?
Who is this weirdo?
Go to the next one.
Oh my God.
Look at it.
Look at here.
Look at it.
Sunanakalutheu.
Follow along with her closely and look at the first examples they give Greek students.
They give armies, generals, slaves.
Yeah.
Attend.
What do slaves do?
They attend on you.
Now why would I need a young naked boy to attend on me and feel that I had to hide it
in a public park at 4 a.m.?
Because I'm not running with Herod when I'm doing it, right?
He can do that kind of stuff.
You can't, bro.
And the rich always do.
That's not a conspiracy.
I'm telling you historically.
That's a fact.
I'm sorry, people.
Goes right back to it over and over and over again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Let's go hit the next one.
Look at this.
I was just going to show you the Sindon.
We've all seen this here.
Let's go through these quick cheery because this is the Sindon, the bandage.
This is weight.
This is Boussinos, right?
Look at the first line.
Boussinos Sindon, right?
Oh, nice.
Right?
Boussinos Sindon.
Oh, no.
No.
