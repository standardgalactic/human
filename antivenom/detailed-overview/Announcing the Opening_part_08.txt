Jesus is with his boys who have fallen asleep because they've been hitting the opium too
much, right?
And behold, Judas, one of the 12, comes, he approaches.
And with him is this big, big crowd with their swords and with their clubs.
They came from the Archpriests and the Elders, okay?
This next one, yeah, we can skip the English.
I don't think the English is that good.
No, I think I already skipped it.
Go there.
Oh, up one.
Yep, yep, yep.
That's OK.
Keep going.
And immediately, yeah, what happened?
He came up to Jesus and he said, Kyrie, Kyrie.
Nice.
A rabbi.
Yeah.
Hi there, rabbi.
And he catafiles in him.
He tongued him.
Right?
Now, I'm telling you, that's the word for kiss, but there are different types of kiss.
And you can categorize them.
There's the kiss that is, you meeting somebody for the first time if you are in Italy, yes,
or saying your friend home for lunch, you know, give him a peck on the cheek.
There's that kind of kiss.
And then there's this kind of kiss, and this is the amorous kiss.
This is the amorous kiss.
This is the intensified kiss.
You know what I'm talking about.
You don't kiss your mother like you do your girlfriend or your boyfriend.
It's a different kind of kiss.
Well, Jesus gives him the wet one.
Right?
He gives him the big one.
He tongs Judas.
Now watch this.
Watch his response.
Notice the Greek, what we're doing with, right?
I'm trying to introduce us to tonight is that refining, refining in order to get you
to see, look, you can make bigger words than you are actually in your brain.
Your brain can do that.
It can come up with bigger concepts.
Love it.
Do the next one.
Mmm.
Going once.
Yeah.
And he kissed him.
Look.
They cleaned it up.
Listen.
That's feet.
Oh, brothers.
That's not.
Very dirty, deceitful men of the cloth.
Oh, by the way, take it down for a second.
I got to talk about some of my background that I didn't get to talk about before, which
I thought was very nice.
I thought it was very nice.
Yeah.
Um, some of it striking and scary, which is punctuated in the video by lightning and
thunder, right?
You can hear the thunder in the background.
So when we talk about, which I thought was great effect, um, when we talk about the things
that we talk about with your, you know, we're getting there.
Let's do it.
Bring me back the source.
Yeah.
Go give me that one.
Um, here it is.
Yeah.
It can also mean to caress.
It's basically to give intimate love, to give that intense, right?
That kata is an intensifier.
Now you'll know, because in the future when we put a kata with something, you'll know,
oh, this thing augments it.
This thing causes it to enter into the most of the most, right?
If this is a comparative, right?
This is the one that's more than the other one.
Right?
Love it.
Look at the bottom.
This is the amorous kiss.
We only have two more.
Right?
We're almost done.
And Jesus did what he said to him.
Now watch.
You're never going to get this unless you go to the Greek.
So Judas comes up and gives Jesus a giant mouth kiss.
Right?
Jesus is there with his days to boys and the naked kid.
Right?
You gotta imagine.
You gotta set it up, right?
He's already been stumbling around, unsure on his feet.
He doesn't want to do what he's going to do to get from that kid, what he was trying
to get.
And then all of a sudden he says, oh my, you know, here they, here comes betrayer.
Get up.
Let's go.
He says, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
All right?
But it's too late.
We're in the middle of talking to him.
Jesus is already there on top of him.
French kissing him.
Yeah.
And then how do we know that it's French kissing?
