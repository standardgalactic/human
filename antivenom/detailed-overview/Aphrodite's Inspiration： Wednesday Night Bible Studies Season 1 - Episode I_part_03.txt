Son of man. You'll see this is translated terribly, terribly through the Masoretic tradition. It doesn't use the right word, right? Didn't use Adam, right? It's son of man.
Interesting title. And they understood this in the first century. That's why you know who is going around, call himself. Good.
Yeah. What do you say? Son of man. There were two women. Long story short. You know, duo gunaikis. These two, you know, females. Yeah. And they were the daughters of one mother.

Okay. Don't worry. The text reinforces this. We're talking about a young girl. We're talking about a young girl. Okay. Verse four. And the names of these girls was Oula and the older one, right? Oula. Isn't that a nice name? The Masoretic text again messes up here.
