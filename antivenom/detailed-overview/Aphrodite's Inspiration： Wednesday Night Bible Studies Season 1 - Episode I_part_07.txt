But we have ice cream and goodies for everyone and whatever's in this.
Excellent.
What text were you using? Yeah, I was using the Septuagint Ezekiel 23.
Ezekiel chapter 23.
Can I just... Here, you want a little bit more? This is hilarious. I got to show you this.
Bring up for us, please, the translation. The King James.
This is the King James translation of the third verse of that passage.
This is the verse where it says she grew up there in Egypt where she was committing this act,
ex-pornating with these people, and it was before her breasts fell.
Yeah, so watch the King James translation. This is funny.
And they committed hordyms in Egypt. They committed hordyms in their youth there where their breasts pressed.
And there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
The teats of their virginity.
What? That's not even in the text. You can't even get a whiff of that. Who's bruising? What?
Okay, then you ask yourself, how can you have the Septuagint? The text we just looked at,
which is quoted by Paul and anybody else is quoting it in the New Testament.
They're quoting that text that we just read.
So how is it that we get bruised teats out of that?
Yeah, it's not. Yeah, it's just not there.
I thought hordyms was nice. Hordyms is a little bit almost angry. Angry. Incredible.
More questions.
Can we get to breaking the cup?
That's fantastic. This is Rob. Okay, breaking the cup.
