Yeah, if you just imagine that leave, you're living in antiquity, right?
The earliest images you hear about this savior, right? Up until this time it has been a female, but a savior.
And what does he look like? He looks like a dude with the head of an ass.
Yeah, fantastic. I found an ancient. I'll say one more thing. I found an ancient. I look real close into your eyes.
And I'll tell you I found an ancient text. Everybody knows about it already. It's been translated.
But it's by a priest. And this Hellenistic priest is doing stuff with these vellums and he's got a, he coded his name in the text.
And under his name he has the initiatory myth or song by which people are brought through the gateway.
And it's all about the ass. Yeah, and his burden.
And with that, we'll leave it. We'll leave it. Thank you for coming tonight. I hope this was helpful.
Please leave comments and let me know. Hey, you know, shorter, longer, more media, whatever you would like with these.
And thank you to our artist. I just want to introduce agent Ferrari, who Hail Satan is able to provide you with some of this art.
He's a real artist and it's a real pleasure. It's a real pleasure to work with him.
So some of the images that you see coming up will be his dedications. So Hail Satan on that, right?
Thank you, congregation. And I will see you Saturday, if you Friday night, rather, for Sabat, at which time we will progress.
We will progress to what's called the Black Harbor, the Black Harbor, and that is in our ancient antidotes text.
And we'll cut to the chase. I see your comments and I'm going to refine my approach based upon what people are interested in.
I like to have that interaction. So thank you everybody for coming and have a good evening.
