Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
This is the Bed of the Muse
And what I want to do tonight
Is to give you a little bit of the future
I'm gonna pull it back
I'm gonna stand right here
Where we are to get it
I'm gonna share it with you
Because that's what you want
To see something new
And you want to expand
You want to have your eyes opened
You wouldn't be here
If you didn't want to have your eyes open
We're gonna start
Tonight
And by the way, thank you, Teddy Bass
Thank you, Teddy Bass
There's a couple of albums that Teddy
Has composed and put together
And engineered for your
Masterful
Reprogramming
Yeah, definitely
It's lovely, some nice Teddy Bass music
If you want to listen to it
Do I make any money off Teddy Bass?
No, I don't
What I am here for is not
To be making money
And for all of those of you who are writing in
And are saying, this is fantastic
That you're not doing this for money
No, stay not monetized
You see
That's the way you
Get around to the back door
Do you understand?
Yeah, it's nice
Anyway
Yes, what are we doing? Teddy kicks
Yes, he does
Yes, he does, buttocks
Everybody loves him, don't they?
I do, a couple of albums
With everything
That we've been doing here at Lady Babylon
They're nice, man
They're nice, take a look at those
Let us get to the
Real tonight
That's where we're going
And all of this was just a little
Hoo-ha dance and show
A little distraction
So that we could get the machine
To get us there safely
And here we are, we're going to step out
Into that ancient right one more time
Now I know people are looking at the thumbnail art
And they're going, oh my god
Oh my god, what is
This going to bring tonight
What sort of
Disaster does this
Imagery portend
Don't worry, I promise you
Every time we're together
I promise you a fantastic date
And so look, you have given me your time
Let me to honor you
And give you the best of the best
Are you ready for this?
There's a type, don't bring it up yet
There is a type of person
Who says
What Dr. Hillman says
Only applies
To the medicine
All of this Christing talk
None of that applies
It's all strictly medical terminology
Now I told you people
From the very beginning
Satanic congregation
I told you
They will take you
They will distract you
And they will do things to you
And if you even know it
You will be violated mentally
They will tell you
That the Bible doesn't have
These technical terms
That this is only doctors
And they do that because
They are ignorant
Of their own
Texts
The real weakness of Christianity
Is Christians
Yeah, the real weakness
So what we have done here
Is satanic congregation
We have taken your tax
And we have re-
Asserted control
They don't belong to you anymore
You can't even read them
You can't even read
Your own holy books
Somebody will tell you
In the future
Dr. Hillman
Dr. Hillman knows the medical stuff
And G. Golly
Beaver
His
Knowledge of the Greek
Is just too strong
For us to wrestle with directly
But there is a difference
Between the medicine and the Bible
There is no Christing
They will tell you in the Bible
Chewie, get us to the place
Where there is Christing
Show us what is it
It's in the apocalypse
It's in the apocalypse
If you want to be the closest to the Greek
You are going to say apocalypse
Not revelation
Apocalypse
And what does he say
First word
I counsel you
Who is this talking
This is the great
This is the great one
Listen
Listen
What does he counsel
Just look at the last two lines
Halfway through the second to last line
Cholurion
In Christi
Do you see that second to last word
On the second to last line
In Christi
What do you think that's from
