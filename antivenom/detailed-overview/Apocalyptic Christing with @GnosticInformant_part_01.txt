Give it to him
Did you people not even read
Your own texts
No, that's the problem
The weakness, the Achilles heel
Of Christianity is its own ignorance
Its own ignorance
They can't beat you
If you know
Their texts
Better than they do
And that's the fun
You see how that works
The trade off was I can't make any money off it
What did I get for that
I got that muse
I got that connection
Isn't that gorgeous
Pure
Pure incense
That's the stuff that gets you to the gods
Love it
Love it, are you ready
What is the big man telling us
Here in the apocalypse
He's telling us I want you to
In Christ, wait
Before we go to the drugs
Chewie, I know you love the drug stuff
Before we go to the drugs, go back
What is he telling you on the bottom line
Look, doos of Thelmus
Su
Your eyes
I want you to Christ your eyes
And why, why, you can go ahead and change it
Why would you want me to Christ my eyes
Big G
Why would you want me to do that
Ah
So that you
May see
So that you may see
Do you know what they were doing
They were using drugs
Using drugs
To see
And hear
They were using drugs
As religion
What you have
By faith
Is not the original
Ah
What you have by faith
Lacks the purple
What you have by faith
Lacks that little kid
That was with Jesus Christ
When he was arrested in a public park
Screaming, I am not
A child trafficker
It's the same stuff that went down for
Moe
It's the same stuff
It's that Bacchic blood
That gets in your veins and next thing you know
You're out with a bunch of people
Holding up a snake
You want to hear the voice of God
You got to follow those monists
You got to follow those monists
That virus
That infects the history of the human brain
Akhenaten
You got to go with the monists
And destroy everything
Right, right
Oh my goodness
No, let's not
What are you people doing
If they found enjoyment
In that proposal
Something's wrong
Think of the great mother
Do you know what kills Nazis?
The great mother does
Oh
Isn't that lovely
Listen to the power
Listen to the power
So someone will say
Hey
What this person is saying
In the Greek does not apply
Because that's a specialty
You tell that person
You tell that person
You need to read your own Bible
You need to read it
You need to read it
Let's go to the next one
Look, this is the
Now I wanted to start this
I just want you to notice people
What kind of drugs for the people who are new
Who haven't seen what kind of drugs they are
And for the people who are learning
Greek at all and you
Try to follow some of these words
Through here in the blue
Watch what happens
What is a pharmacone?
It's a drug whether healing or noxious
Right
And look
It's frequently used by
Determined what kind of drugs are
By the epithets that are with them
And he gives us some name
Look at the one
The one that is
Killing the pain
You need painkillers
You got cacopharmacados
Bad drugs baby
You got man killers here
Androfonon
That's a man killer
What kind of drugs?
You got pionian drugs
You know where you are if you got a pionian drug
You
Are in the second, third, fourth or fifth heaven
Wait
What is that? How do I go there?
It's a trip
You're gonna love it
Are you ready? You thought your vacation was good
You got Thanacema
Defendusers
And you got Olethrion
Destroyers
Oh god
So many different capacities
To do with the drugs
Now you know why there's so many
Dymones and why it is
That Jesus Christ right after he gets off
A boat and somebody's like
I heard you healed all those people
That had those demons and ha
Bring the demons my, got this little girl
And she's whacked out in the eschaton
Lady touches
This gown
Nobody's ever understood why it is
That you can reach out
Touch the Christ
And be healed
Do you know how that is?
Cause if you got an issue of blood
He's got
Your drugs
Embedded
He's walking around with linen
That's embedded with these drugs
This is do it
It's how they take these things on a chronic
Basis
There's no fairy tale
