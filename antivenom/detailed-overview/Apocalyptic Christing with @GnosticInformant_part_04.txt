And they will tell you
Orthodox Jews will come to you
And they will tell you
Taliban will come to you
And they will tell you
There is a wall of separation
Between the faithful
And the unfaithful
No, no there isn't
Historically there just isn't
And that's why the two
Are mutually destructive
Why they will try to destroy each other
Yes
There is a vaccination
For the mental
Virus
Of monism
There's a vaccination for it
And it's called reality
If you can open up somebody's
Inner reason because we are
All children
Of reason
If you can open that up
And show somebody
You can inoculate them
Who was arrested in the public park
With a naked boy
Let's go to the next one
I want to show you a little bit of beauty
Take us out
That's good, where were we
And here's that colics
What is that colics?
We got that, go to the next one
Boom
And here's the trojisco
And if you think it's really not
Something related to drugs
Look at number two
It's not anything from sobs to medicine
It gives all sorts of authors
Their right
And he says Galen of course
It's the standard people
That nobody ever reads in classics
Galen
Soranus
Orabaceous
Orabaceous
All physicians right now
Should we cut them out and say
What the words are that
They use don't apply to the Christians
We absolutely can't
And people are beginning to see that
And I'm telling you
There's going to be an opening
Of an understanding
Of this very point
Very soon
It's coming
It's already been set in motion
And it's coming
And when it happens you will see
How the Bible scholars
The rabbis, the mullahs
How
And how far
A field
They have come
From the original
Yeah
We are today living in a figment
Of our own imagination
Yeah isn't that something
Let's go it's wonderful hit the next one
I want out right who wants out
What did I see when I've been Christed
I see this
Great angel
And he's announcing in this big voice
Is whoever is worthy
To open
To open the book you mean they had books
No
No
To open up the process
That is written on the scrolls
Whoever wants to do that
Has to release
The seals
Has to release the seals
Do you want to do that tonight
Let's go release the seals what are the seals
Tell me please what are the seals
Again they're drugs
Look at the seals they're drugs
They're drugs
Look at number three give me the next one
Give me the next one
What are the seals
They're tablets of Lemnian medicinal earth
Certified
As such
By bearing the impressions of the seal
Of the Lemnian
Priestess of Artemis
Do you want to know what the mark of the beast is
Do you want to know what the mark
Of the theriac is
It's that
Lemnian Artemis
Because you're not going to get there
Unless you get christened
And you remember don't you who was
Who invented christing
We're going to see
Oh god
Let's go let's go next one
Boom
And oh this is just
Yeah this is for the seal
This is the seal
You can talk about a seal as a pastel again
Look at B
It says
What is that it's the seal of Pachius
And Pachius is one of the
Physicians who's guaranteeing what
An ISAB
An ISAB and where are they getting this
Galen I told you nobody reads Galen
Who's a class assistant
Very few
Sabs were certified
By seal impressions
Does everybody see
Where we have landed
Now everybody should be caught up
And with this knowledge now
We can go forward with something big
Let's look
Let's look at the origin
Of this seal
And these drug using cults
Let's look at the origin of it
Give me I think it's the next one
Who is this
It's Aristophanes now this is going to be
A little bit hard on your ears
So I'm going to translate
Aristophanes and I know that
People would
It's Aristophanes he's the
Greek who's the comedian
And Greek comedy is not
Very much like modern
English
You know American or European
Canadian
Australian
Any of the English speaking
Countries where I can talk
About comedy with any
Accuracy
You don't really see
The Greek comedy coming
It's very it's what you would call
Banel
