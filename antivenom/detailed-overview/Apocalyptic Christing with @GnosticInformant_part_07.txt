noise generated by the m psychic by the what yeah the grease aren't understand sometimes by the in

who are we doing this all for now this is some Greek and you can guess whether or not
this belongs to the Bible or this belongs to something pagan that's not the Bible right the
only reason we have the distinction between the Bible and what is not the Bible is to create that
barrier what is Jew or Gentile what is Christian or non-Christian what is Taliban or what is defiled

physician and the prophet he is wise do you know who this is talking about this is talking about
the one whose worship you get to through christing and it's Apollo it's Apollo yeah christianity
borrowed no christianity and borrow apollonian and bachic worship it just performed it yeah
through an intermediary who was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy screaming
I am not a child trafficker I am not a child trafficker and that naked boy had a medicated
bandage on his private parts as he should have if he were acting within the rights of the mystery
the reality that is here is being uncovered it is an antichrist it will be the antidote
to the fervor of the faith if you show somebody the reality their false construction in their brain
will be dissolved by the power of the real it's always the mother it's always the great mother

greek let's all love mother greek thank you mother greek for what you've done to my tiny
tiny brain made it cause it to grow just one little one little extra connection tonight
hit my hippocampus and went up to cortex ah climactic did you feel it now let's do the post
climax with neil bring him on is he around i am going to go consult the winds because it is time
for me to do that i'm going to give you the stage not chewy shoot him with a laser with
your bowcaster if he deviates from the classical sources you understand me if he deviates okay
i'll be back it's your stage neil hit these people there's 837 so be respectful to these people
love it go wow 837 people what's going on y'all so i have actually pinned the tip of the chat
the source material from which i've gathered today that you can you can all go and get the link for
yourself and look into this stuff it's all there shout out to hisekius sixth fifth sixth century
grammarian living in a time where it's post it's post apocalyptic world and it's christianity is
now reigning supreme the adosius is is enacting all these all these laws shutting down the pagan
temples i even found out recently this is all coming in my next video that there was a decree
issued that literally made the bhakik chance illegal for grape harvesters because they had
such a problem with the the people who were in charge of grape harvesting were all but obviously
they're all bhakins right and they're all part of the ritual was to chant yeah oh yeah oh yay yo
yay yeah yes uh and that that was part of their their ritual to make these bhakik chance while
they're harvesting grapes the adosius had a decree and then they had another decree in like the seventh
century and they had to reissue this decree remind them it is illegal to use the to bhakik chant yeah
so that's you'll see that in my video i don't have that exact uh screenshot but if you want to pull
up the screen right here this is what led me down this path so just want to give a quick shout out
to carl karenny because he has in his book appeared viewed by princeton from 1976 he says that there
is a tablet from naso's crete in my sony and linear b that actually has the name for dian ices
called yawaka yawaka and then he he cites yakar the name sirius which he says that's here's the
name of the tablet you can look it up i'm actually i actually will show the tablet in my video i don't
have that here right now but from arastophanes we know this is the name of bhakis because he
arastophanes says yake yake o yake uh nuteru teletes phosphorus ester kindles the flaming
torch is brandishing each one in hand yakos yakos the light bringing lucifer star of the
nocturnal mysteries so he cites just to get you up to speed of how i even got here he cites
hisekius right here for his lexicon so let's go let's let's talk about hisekius right first of all
we have a god named yasio you already have that root yaw in there it's a healer god some people
equate him with adis you know he's a mystery god he's he's invoked the mysteries there might be some
drug condom uh drug references there a bind we and i make something to do with his name
and you'll see this in a second when i get to the um when i get to the uh uh material so we all
know this chant we all know this source i've been brought it up here many times that the
caldeans refer to dianesis as yaho called sabo oath or sebazias right so here we go
right off the bat the yoe is a bakik shout this is one of these banned bakik shouts that was banned
by the church any loud shout or cry of men and women right or the sound of the lear as known as
says is the yoe so i just want to before i continue i just want to um put me on a full screen for one
putting on a full screen for one second i just want to lay something out real quick
the fiercest is the magic wand of the bakins dianesis's staff is called a fiercest the main ads
if you were a if you're a main ad if you really want to be a main ad and i encourage you to become
a main ad this is a this is the religion of the future that i would love people i would love to see
get yourself a fiercest so go out get yourself any any stick from you know nice nice rod nice
perpendicular straight up and down stick from nature but add a pine cone to the tip of it
tie it with a purple ribbon and then you have yourself a fiercest it's a magic wand the fiercest
in in the magical greek magical papyri mystical rites is the letter iota the letter iota is a
magic wand that's why it's up and down and it could have an aspiration on it it could have a rough
breathing on it it can be you know you put your dot on top of it all that you know the different
different forms and different paradigms that we see the iota with but when you add a vowel to it
that's the magic the magic comes when you add a vowel to it so how you tune that magic wand
is how you perform the magic all right let's let me explain now let me put my money where
i'm at let's put this put the source back up if you don't mind chewy chewy is always on point
so yo a is one of these shouts right so iota plus omega gives us yo a right now this is interesting
yeos yeos is a bach it's actually an apollonian shout so yaho is a bachic shout but we know
that apollo and Dionysus are two faces one of them's heavenly the other one's chthonian
they're both the princes of Zeus right and so apollo and Dionysus as acromius tells us are the
same god the yeos the yeos is the apollonian shout the yaho is the bachic shout remember that
it's also the second the second definition we get it's a mourning grievous as Sophocles says
yeos bo a cry of mourning from Euripides thank you ellis for those sources love it so here's
here's a passage from Plutarch from the mouth of his teacher Amonius talking about apollo
this is one of his uh the famous by the way if you know about Plato Plato Plato's sage is Socrates
but if you read Plutarch Plutarch does the same thing but his sage is Amonius so Amonius is like
Socrates where he writes nothing down and everything we know about Amonius is through the dialogues
that Plutarch delivers as Plutarch was the student of Amonius so Amonius tells him apollo
is this yeos this is like one of the only few sources where we get that word yeos so this is
these two sources Sophocles and Euripides mentioned this yeos as a title of apollo
by the way Jesus's name starts with ye in the front of it so that's something to just keep that in
mind ye Jesus it's not hell Zeus it's something deeper than that right so there's that ye in the
front it has to do with healing it has to do with drugs and then as you're going to see it has to do
with purple too I have all these sources ready to go so all right so apollo or um uh Plutarch
through the mouth of Amonius talks about apollo being called ye use all right what's going on here
so let's talk about this yeos yeos a poison a poison from serpents Venom of a mad dog right
