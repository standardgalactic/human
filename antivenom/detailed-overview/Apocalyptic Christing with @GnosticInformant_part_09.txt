midianite pot pottery also called curia painted pottery is a found in numerous sites stretching
from the southern levant saudi arabia hejaz blah blah blah blah the pottery is bi-chrome polychrome
style and it dates as early as the 13th century bc by the way that's the exact same time is that
naso's tablet that mentions yawaka exact same century ready for this it's many geometric human
and animal teeths are painted in brown and dark reds on pinkish tan slips midianite pottery is
found in its largest quantities in metallurgical sites in the southern levant especially tina
because of the mycenian motifs on midianite pottery some scholars including george mendenhall
pete parr and ben th rothenberg have suggested the midianites were originally sea peoples who
migrated from the aegean and then posed themselves on a pre-existing somatic stratum
the archaeology even points to yawai coming from the aegean it's thionisus don't you love
that tacitus can be right after so many years he called it he said they came from crete and
everyone was like that's not right well the archaeology saying that he might be honest something
and by the way the fact that yawai is not mentioned in any of the ugeritic sources
where is he he has to come from somewhere and if we have yaw and yay and yo all over the greek
and all of a sudden this new god comes up from from the midianites and takes over the cults of
israel becomes this new amazing god and all over the old testament there's vine and great motifs
everywhere golden satyrs in the temple of salomon great vines everywhere israel's called
a vine it's very dienesian herodotus even says when i went there do my studies all the only two
gods they worship was dienisus nephrodite it's it's it's monist neo it's um yawai is the monist
response to bachic worship um and i'm i'm i'm not the only one who talks like that uh
plutarck was talking like that too um it just is akhenaten split off and from the
from the um polytheist origin and made himself the all right just just in that same
monist tendency that's what yahu is right jehovah is a monist response to a bachic saturnian
religion yeah love you know who else says that too is kelsus in the second century
kelsus says that this religion is is he goes he says the jewish religion is not new or something
that's like special it broke off from the ancient rites and he says i think the word he uses was
it's um he says something along the lines of it became uh infected or i think he uses a different
word than that but he basically says that they are corrupted he says it's a corruption of the
ancient rites so i'm not surprised to find a name of the name of the same name of dienisus
found in this god as this and as you said it becomes more of a central leading figure you
know the you know the we know that we know we all know the hypsisterians are it's not nothing new
to greeks monism the pathagarians are doing that shit all the time they're they're arguing back
and forth between do we like homework do we not like homer this is all this ain't new this isn't
just happening in israel just happens that in israel that shit really takes root that those
ideas really take root and and there's nothing wrong with seeing that history for what it was it
doesn't um it's only the theology that breaks the back of that camel you know what i mean it's
it's a theology that says this must be the first divinity and it must be the creation story we got
so many years and our history is going to be that creation story it's only that um group that um that
has those monest you know this drawn to monism that will turn away when you're drawn to monism
you your justice is not your highest standard right your democracy is only there because of
these gods like justice and nemesis right and all the court of the athenians it's all has to do with
that appeasement of the furies right very oh god it's all feminine gorgeous gorgeous gorgeosity i love
it the the caldian oracles are spot on they said you know they call the finnishians had the name
of the Dionysus is yaho and couple that with what they're saying like you know plutar talks about
they're they're they're by the oh this is another one the succot festival it's it's one of the most
one of the holiest date one of the holiest weeks it's a week it's a festival in the it's a festival of
um uh harvest at the end of the fall and it's happens at the exact same week as the thesmaphoria
the law giver festival of Dionysus and Demeter and they it's a harvest festival happens at the
exact same time of the year and you know what they do and plutar writes all about this in his in his
um the in his questions of moralia he says at this as he calls it a thesmaphoria because they call it
a feast of booths or a succot or tabernacle festival and at this festival they do exactly what the
elosinians do they feed they they garnish their tables with with tabernacles and fruits and they
like candles and they drink wine and it's a it's a basically a full-blown Dionysian wine harvest
festival they call this but another thing plutar points this out too did you would you know that
they have four holy plants that they that they carry two of them are are um are oh shit what is it
it's palm trees and let me just look this up real quick palm trees and i have it right here fine is
it queson is it that i find is on the table but they carry myrtle and palm in their hands into the
temple did you know that the that myrtle myrtle is for aphrodite the thesmaphoria they carry palm
trees and myrtle branches into the temple exactly the same way as succot so they're so these right
as just as calysis says calysis is so smart by the way read calysis's arguments against christianity
that book i was a christian when i read that book it messed me up i was like no way this guy's crushing
he says that these rights are the they really are the ancient mystical rights but they're the corrupted
he said they've been deeply corrupted for greed and all this he then goes into this whole thing
but he's right the it's you're looking at when you're when you're looking at judeo christianity
in the second century bc first century and so forth and christianity comes out of it yawism i
think it's the best correct term to use um you're looking at the ancient rights corrupted you're
looking at corruption of the ancient mystical rights that you find in elusis that you find in
samothrace that you find in frigia the frigian mysteries you're just finding a corrupted version
a tweaked a sort of copyrighted version right you know how you get like you know how you got
nike and then you go to the store on the street and they got the fake nikes they're like you can
tell it looks like nike but you're like these are some cheap ass shoes right here that's what
yawism is dude it's the corrupted rights it's what it is just being real yeah yeah it's this
you're being history that's what you're doing is you're looking at the history and that that is
what the bacchic power is meant to do it's meant to cause you to look into that mirror once you can
see yourself then you know the apollonian temple thing of know yourself that makes sense and by
the way i know it's a little something about about those shouts yeah i love those i love that no um i
gotta say niel you put together a gorgeous and absolutely gorgeous linguistic analysis you even
took us you took us through zikius but you took us as far back as the mycenae in greek um which is
where we get that deonus sauce in the first place so brilliant job i can't think of uh you know who
you blew it out of the sky ape that's like a plus work you know what i mean i wanted to bring
that to your last one because you were talking about the name yesus in the last episode for some
reason i passed out like an hour before you went live and i woke up at two in the morning i was pissed
i was like did you feel the swat because i gave you a swat on your buttocks yeah i got it because i
said no i said he probably i said he's exhausted he's probably fell asleep right because you're
working on your stuff like round the clock right nilo text me i don't even have a bedtime i'm just
up until i until my body says go to sleep but not yet it could be four in the morning six p.m it could be
two p.m it could be 11 a.m it doesn't matter whenever whenever my body says enough it's enough
enough researchy shit dude i have a whole pile of books over here right now you you'd laugh if you saw it
it's uh it's dope and i wake up in the mornings and i've got 12 texts from nil and you can just
go through them and see you just track the sources that he was hitting right it's i'm isn't it true
nil that when you get into it and you start seeing the reality in in the greek you just can't i don't
know you just get something here's the crazy part the name yesus has that shout in there
it's in the it's in the name and here's another thing people always say this all the time they go
this is the telltale sign if if if something's mythology it's when you know for example let's
look at asops fables in asops fables the character name the character's name has to do with what the
person's doing so the guy let's say the guy's name is sleepy and he's sleeping a lot in the myth
then you know it's not a real person it's a it's a it's a fable
jesus's name yesus and he's out there healing people applying drugs to people's eyes and his name
is yesus yeah are you kidding me yeah his name that's what i'm so glad you see that because that's
exactly how frustrating it is to tell anybody you know yesus christos is like drug man drugger right
i mean you can't you can't get worse than that you can touch this guy notice you know people
know for a long time they've been like the woman with the issue of blood just touched jesus's clothing
she was like oh it was a miracle you know i mean you saw tonight that there was great for taking a
drug and putting it into oh someone like a priest's headband headband right you know what is that healer
profit well you know if you take that healer profits headband and suck on it you're gonna start
seeing stuff and it had that k k r e root in there i'm you know it may be something going on there
but you know what i'm look i know that yesus was a fairly common name of people in the first
jason is another one yason yesus yashua there's a lot of these i'm not saying these didn't exist
but i'm saying what they wrote about him later is not really it's not historic there's probably a
little bit of historical shit in there probably i actually think there's fairly amount fairly good
amount of historical shit i think he was going around with his with his with his crew performing
all these rights i think there's there's historical truth there but at the end of the day the guy's
name is yesus and he's out there healing people you got to say you guys sit there and say this is
like superman now superman being super you know what i mean this is like you got to say all right
separate the myths from the reality here totally totally and for those of you since you just mentioned
superman i'm gonna have to say um chewie chewie uh demands that um henry cavill reach out to her
she demands it um just wanted to add that in please henry she's holding me hostage henry if there's
any way if there's any way i can get this to you she's holding me hostage please please henry
reach out okay good now she won't she'll leave me alone thanks chewie have the shout on your chest
can you can you tell us about that or show us that what's there it is yay it's exactly what you
were talking about and it's it's pion now i chose the you will see the ea pion you see that a lot
in the text but i chose i found one text that was iodian and it used a longer vowel in the end it
was pionic went ahead and used the omega and i thought that takes guts that takes guts to use
that omega and so i liked it and um yeah it's a special shout it is remember how they have
i was saying tonight i don't know if you caught it neil but i was saying you have pionic drugs
right well that shout that is a part of taking those drugs is that victory that um that that
solar it actually is a solar victory that apollo the lucifer who brings that light yeah
so i love it i love it yeah i mean you get so that's funny because apollo is called lucifer
the day star the sun the day star but dianisus in that and that one etymology that hesekius gives
yakar is the dawn star so the day star and the dawn star but they're both phosphorus
they're both lucifer there's just two different lucifers one of them's the dawn star
other one's the day star isn't that crazy i love it i love it gorgeous man it's gorgeousness and
gorgeosity neil i want to thank you for coming tonight and i want to thank all of the 900 some
people great great that ended up giving us a full hour and 36 minutes of their time i hope
i believe so i don't know probably neil thanks so as well but i hope that you have found things
that justify that hour and a half of your life that you can say oh this this is good stuff man

about this gotta be careful it's it's important to note this might not be true all that careful
shit no one cares tell us what you think tell us what the sources say you know people want people
also want to hide the sources because they're like well if we show them this source it might confuse
