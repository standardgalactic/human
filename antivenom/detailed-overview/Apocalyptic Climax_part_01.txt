Do you want to see what these drug-using people are doing?
Are you ready?
This is mystery people
You have to be ready for the mystery
It's all mystery
Oh, those who took that
Well, that's more of a beast, Martha
No, you are so ignorant
Compose yourself
Oh, may Lucifer have mercy on you
Yes, I hope that he does
Sisters of frustration, hit us
That's why they're not reaching the highest peak
Do you understand?
Because Satan rules here
Oh, God, love it
Is anybody else part of the cult?
Is there just me?
Alright, there's just be one
Go, hit us the next one
Oh, God, what was the next one?
This is so...
Look, people, what are they doing with Haragma?
It's the same thing that happened to this guy
And this is where the Christians can't take you
I'm taking you places the Christians can't
I'm taking you places that no rabbi, no priest
No preacher
Now seminarian, I'm taking you places
They'll look at you and go, huh?
What?
Yeah, but we're doing it
Because we're looking for these
The reality
Did we get out of this?
Yeah, we did
Look, here it is
What happened?
This guy's name is Philip T
He says, look, I'm sitting here
Because these generals and this Wanox
The Kefalanians, what did he do?
They left me here
They shipwrecked me here in this Eremon
With this terrible wild disease
Festering in my bod
It was put there
By the strike of that echidna
By its Haragmati
Oh, oh, do you know what it does to you?
Ask Paul
Ask Paul the apostle
Ask Paul the apostle
How far up...
You can drop that one
How far up you can get on this stuff
Ask him
Are you ready?
You didn't want...
Here it is
Here's the beast
Fulfillment
Fantastic
Bring it
Bring the next one
Boom
Zop
Excellent
Before we do that
Go back to the top
We've got to go back to all the wrong
Right there
Boom
Next one
Boom
That one was destroyed
Okay
Look at people
He says, what happens here?
So, look, they figured out the theriac
And the...
Underneath its influence
The false prophet was making the semea
And they were taking the semea
And they were wandering
They were wandering
They were worshiping
They were proskinesising
They were bending the knee
To the image
Of it
Oh, they had the beast
And what did they do?
They took the haragba
Oh, I get it
I get it
Oh, God
And what happened under this?
They took this...
You mean prophet?
What happened?
What happened to the prophet
Who was leading them in the future?
What happened to him?
You know, the future's never going to happen, right?
You didn't get that memo?
Oh, too bad
Let's go!
Go to the next one
Bring it
Roll it
Are you ready?
Oh, Dionysus
What do you have to say, brah?
Nice to see you, brah
What do you have to say?
Put on your boocey-noose petloose
What?
Cover your flesh, baby
Cover your flesh with it
What is it I need?
Oh, it's hot
It's hot, Chewie
Go ahead
This one's coming in hot
We can only take a couple of seconds
Till we've got to go
Oh, God, no!
No, look!
What did I stumble upon?
I stumbled on the purple
Right?
Because that boocey-noose that you're going to see
Which is a...
Let's see if we can find that definition
I think...
I think I lost that poor definition
Well, she'll come up later
She's like a wandering child
People, look what we've got right here
Porphyria, right?
Right?
Porphyra
Oh, they just dug this out
Julius Caesar's
Grandpa's
Beautiful
Luxury home
Down there in Herculaneum
Love it
Remember what Julius Caesar
Hung in the temple of
Venus Genatrix?
Did you guys remember that?
I told you that
He hung the portrait of Medea
The Medua?
Yes!
Yes, he did
He did
Why?
Because they were Donbringers
Yeah, Donbringers
Isn't that nice?
Oh, God, it's gorgeous
There it was
We'll come back to this
But I want everybody to know
I want everybody to know
This fine that they made
In Herculaneum
And the subsequent
Getting the scans
To analyze these charred up scrolls
Oh, God, you're about to receive dumps
We're about to get dumps
Have lost
We're hitting it great
What does it make?
Those two junk pots
Of dead sea scrolls
Look like they're copying
To a dead archaic form
Of, oh, my God, seriously?
Two pots
We have just discovered
Lucifer just buried
Just buried that false history
Oh, my God
What a world we live in
Oh, I love the fact that this is his world
Oh, what did we find?
The library
We found this dude's library
It happens to belong to
Friggin' Julien
The Julien family
Oh, my goodness
You're going to get some great stuff out of this
Let's go to the purple
Since we just stumbled on it
Go
Maybe there's a reason to this madness
Yeah, there you go
People, what am I bringing you?
Look, this is Diascortes
And I just want you to see
I've been talking about the burning purple
And if you look here at number four
Yeah, there's our porfura
Right?
And caesa
And it's in an ehedunum
And serantiqued
Oh, what is this?
This is our burning purple
This is our burning purple
People have been asking me
What's the burning purple?
And what does it tell?
Well, it says it
Right here, people
And guess what?
It's a katastal decay
For hooper sarcomaton
Wait, what?
Yeah
It is a cure
For those growths
Yeah
Yeah
So the purple
Don't be surprised
If it has a huge impact
On your culture
Don't be surprised
Yeah
You know what that stuff does
