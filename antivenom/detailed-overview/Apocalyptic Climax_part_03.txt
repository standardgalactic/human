These are the texts
Go to it
I love it
Everybody needs a spanking
Spanking for everyone's
Everyone out there
Are you out there?
Are you out there in your car?
Where are you spanking for everyone?
Just one
That's just one
Let's go
Okay, stop
Somebody's gonna write to me
About going to hell again
I try to do it, but you know
And what's happening?
Well, it's into the ions of ions
Right?
Where are you going?
You're going into the ion
Where do you think Paul was talking about?
There's a physics here
Fantastic
Let's see what Christ is all about
Give us the next one
Show us
Oh, show us
Let's sit here
Finally, we caught up
Here, look here
I told you, boosting us
Look at this
Okay, bandages
Look, fine linen
Wait a minute
Look at those
Right at the beginning of the definition
It says made of busos
And then it says
Seendon
Right?
It's...
Remember, we talked about the thing
That was wrapped on the naked kid
That was with Jesus
Who runs private parts
Okay
Here
Here we are
Here we are
Right?
For wounds
Remember, I told you
How they use it medically
And they impregnate it
Right?
I wasn't the one who made this stuff up
Right?
This is from antiquity
They're doing it
Okay, so
Welcome
Welcome
Here it is
The fulfillment is here
Here we go
Next one, please
Oh, and I'm sorry
Look at the bottom
Look at the...
Don't let Hesechius
This is Hesechius
Don't miss the bottom
What does it say?
Por furus
What?
The purple is there
You're darn right
And the purple is there
On Jesus
On his fingers
On the stuff on his face
That they're saying
Look at that
What's that stuff?
What's that junk on your face, bro?
When you arrest someone
And take them in
And they had just been arrested
In public park
With the naked kid
And the police
AKA the Romans
Are saying
What?
You know, these soldiers
They're like
What?
What?
You wonder
Why they beat them up
Do you know what happens
In prison systems?
To pedos?
They beat you up
Yeah
Yeah, if they don't kill you
It's a badge of honor
Right?
It's the
Way the system is
The only reason I know it
Is not because
I've watched something on Netflix
No
It's because
I knew someone who was
On the inside
For doing things
To cars
And he was also
A very good
Very good tattoo artist
So he had a
Strong function
And, you know
Behind bars
And, you know
Was kind of protected that way
Yeah, you know
A good tattoo artist
Is hard to find
Do we have any more
Of our tattooed Christians?
What is that?
Go ahead
Bring it up
Oh, flash that
Do we have any more?
Yeah
Do we have any more
Of our kiddies
Or tattooed children?
Do we have any tattooed?
Yeah
No, go ahead
You can do it
Go ahead
There we go
Yeah
Realized somebody asked me
Just recently
About tattoos and antiquity
And realized
That they are indeed
A priestly thing
They are also
Associated with
Kind of some of the wild
Or more
I don't know
People living in caves
You know
When I say cave
Don't laugh
Cave is nicer than
Any of the houses
That you guys have
Right?
I mean
Look at some of the stuff
Look at Pythagoras' cave, dude
Little grotto of the nymphs
Oh my god
Gorgeous
How would you like to live in that?
Do you see the pools
He's gotten everything?
No wonder they go there
All the time to sing
Right?
Tattoos are often associated with dudes
Like effeminities
Right?
Whose skin they removed
And tanned
And capped
As a
You know
Source of inspiration
Fantastic
I love that stuff
Hit us with another source
Hit us with another source
This is why you Christians
You're going to get marked
You're going to get marked
Right?
If you don't have it yet
You may be one of the
Apostate Christians
You know
They're in the text too
Right?
In the text too
One of the Apostate Christians
Oh I like that position
Let's hold it right there
And I
Saw
Behold
A white horse
And the one sitting upon it
Had a bow
Wait what?
Yeah
A bow
This is Jesus
With a bow
Wait
Why does Jesus have a bow?
Did anybody
Did anybody notice
Jesus had a bow?
Of course
He's got a bow
He's the morning star
Your bone head
Where do you think
All of this cult
Came from?
It's those
Crazy horse-riding freaks
Who've got those women
That you can't get past them
They'll kill you dead
They'll kill you dead
