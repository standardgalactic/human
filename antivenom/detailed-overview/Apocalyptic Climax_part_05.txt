Hits you with the truth
Like Davey Chappelle
Lifting up the boots
And take him to hell
Crown pandemic
COVID
Hard sell
Pharmachea
Needlecraft
Magic gel
I am a powerful dreamer
On you I put a spell
Don't wait on the triple beam
Purple cup pressed down
Full of nova flowing well
Greeny green jelly bean
Dance with the news
Come with me
Point dependent ring
Elemental peas
They love the ca-ching-a-ling
Purple paint base
Down with the yellow brick road
Charlemagne sugar ring a-ling
This dream is in mind
It's yours
And I'm honored to be in it
Rock on Hail Satan
With a cup full of violet
Vagina juice
You know what to do
Briding out
With the stars in the sky
Pharmachea and the deer
Twinkle in your eye
The snake venom
Make some zombie like
Beautiful
Thank you, Teddy
Thank you, Chewie, for that
Lovely, lovely story
Look at the art people
That can be generated
By people who do not
Take your money
Isn't that fantastic?
Remember, everybody involved here
Right?
Lady Babylon, Armado
Is, well, I can't tell you Armado
Because I try not to curse
While I'm talking to you
But it's blank money, right?
Look, I did want to say this from before
I was watching a very popular YouTuber
Giving discussion and topic
About the very same kind of things
That you and I are interested in
And I had to get through 12 commercials
Seems like he was playing about
Once every minute and a half
And I thought after about 15 minutes
15 minutes to that, I thought
How much can you lend your backside
To someone before you say
Hey, something's going to get ripped
Yeah, yeah, greed
Stains the soul with a stench of ruin
Love it, that's why we are
Not monetized
Yes, and are keeping that
Tell, I can't take any contractually
Devil, you know, he'll
Some codices or something
Will kick in in the contract
And the next thing, you know
I'll be fending myself off
Oh, my goodness
There's one person you don't mess with
Right?
You don't mess with Lucifer
Love it, he's always gonna out thank you
He did, he already out thought Yahoo
Right, Yahoo got mad and stomped off
And destroyed the garden
Right?
Lucifer was like, no
No, bro, you don't get it
Let's go to the next one
Let's go, there's
People are giving us their time
People back to the, back to the, look
Oh, yeah, so he sends his angel
Right, he says at the bottom
I am that morning star
Here he is, here he is
Go ahead, next one
Yeah, and what did he do?
Wait, we gotta get the, gotta get that one
Who else is the morning star?
By the way, who else?
Who else is he? Look at this
He's gonna bring us, oh this is what I promised
Ready? Sfragida
Sfragida
Ooh, it sounds, what is that?
What is that? He holds
The entire cosmos by that
Sfragida
Oh, God
For the sake of everything
What does the morning star do?
He has the Sfragida
What is it?
What is that? Let's go, go to the next one
Should have had it on the next one after that, boom
No, of course not
Sorry
Who's, how about, let's try that one
No, no, no
There, okay
Here, Sfragis
Sfragidos
Here it is, go, go, hit it
Hit the next one after this
Cause that's got the real, oh my God
How much definition is this thing?
Am I gonna have to read? Look at this
Open it up for just a minute
I'll try to stay on mark here
But I probably won't be able to
Look, look, look, look, everything
From a gem or a stone to an impression
From a signet ring
All that kind of stuff, take it down
Give me the next one, let's focus in
Focus in, watch once
Oh, look at this, look at number three
Does anybody see number three?
This is a tablet of lemony and medicinal earth
These are the things that Galen went to pick up
You know what I mean?
This is good stuff
These are drugs from the ancient world
Only these, reputedly
Are the top
Panacea
This thing will get you healthy
And keep you healthy
Oh, love it
Love it
We
Killed it, right?
We used it all
Can't find it anymore
Stupid people
Go, people
Tell the watchers they're right
What else is this thing?
The
Sfragida that he mentioned
What are they?
Medically
They're pastiles, right?
Does anybody know what that is?
Right?
Look, oh, you can take these
I've seen the kind
Some of them you can take
And you can put little
Ball of
Medi and you take it
And you put it on the fire
And then you breathe it in
Oh, God, you take the
Another one
You put it in a cup
And you dissolve it
And you drink that
It's part of the medicine
You people
Who are running around
Teaching and preaching
About the seals
Oh, these are the seals
That they're going to break on the book
No
No
No, it's a medical application
Why do you think they're
Why do you think they got the devil
And the false prophet and the giant
Pit full of the smoke
Of purification
People
Come on
Yeah
All you got to do is follow the drugs
Watch what they're doing with the drugs
Go to the next one
Love it, let's try that
Look, people, this is too many
People are going to be like, dude
That long? I got to go
Look, and they shouted
A big voice saying
Look, the salvation
Right, sitting on our throne
Right, our God, oh, love it
Sitting on our throne
What's that last word? Arnio
And on the what?
On the
Arnio
That's a fleece
That's a fleece that you write
On
It's a very protected one
The dragon guards
Wait a minute, did you
I forgot, you were thanking
Lamb
Right
You were thanking Lamb
This is the Lamb of God
And he's next to the
He's next to God and they're on the throne
That's the happy ending
That's decrepit
Seriously?
Let the great mother just rinse
Pull out, you know what I mean?
Oh my God, what's that fleece?
You've got to have the song
Or
You can't have the mystery
You've got to have the song
Don't you understand
