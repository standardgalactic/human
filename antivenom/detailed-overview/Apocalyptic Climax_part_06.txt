Now why they were fumigating themselves?
We saw it in the Mithraic liturgy
We saw it
Why they're fumigating themselves
With the song
They're breathing that stuff in
And they're listening to the chorus
Oh God
Those priestesses, man
Oh God, they set up a world
They just, oh
It's got to come back
We need this healing
You know what I mean?
Next one, please
That's fine
Just in case you think I'm full of it
Look at number two
Fleece
Go to the next one
Immediately, love it
So there is the fleece again
Right? On that middle of the throne
And it
Is what is causing us
To have access
To the waters of life
Right?
Those of you in Satanic congregation
Who know what it means to be born again
Will understand this
Right? They have
The water of life
Remember Jesus
When he's at the well
Right? And he's like, hey
You know what?
Be word
Get me some water
And she's like, why don't you suck it
Right? And he's like
Bang
I got it right here for you
I got your, if you'd asked me
I'd have given you the water of life
And she's like, no, no you can't
He's like, I know you
I know you
You're a lady of the evening
You like it
She was like, well
And from there
You have a group of people
Who will follow you around
And finance you
And set you up
Where you got a place
In downtown
Jerusalem
You know what Jesus had? This is the way
This is the way of Jerusalem
The holy city
You know what you get away with in the holy city?
You can get a room for the night
Fully staffed
With laid out goodies
Mmm
And you can have
You can take whoever you want
You can take a dozen boys up there
If you want

And what happened? The smoke of this thing
Right?
What is the smoke of?
It's the smoke of the Thumia Maton
The
Aroma
Of the herbs
The spices
They prepare in these little bricks
To fumigate people
You stand around that temple and you're in a fog
Did you ever wonder what all the fascination
What fog is?
Yeah, oh god
The cop no bates and all these people
These are smokers, but not smokers
In the way that you and I think
You know, but smokers like, you know
We get 50 of us in a room
You know, we got a big barbecue pit
And we're burning stuff
Didn't you have a picture of something like that?

They're burning or something
Yeah, anyway
That act
That act is really what's being featured here
And he says it's, you know
It's going up in those prayers
Right? Of those people
Who are entering into the ride
And who's giving it to us baby
It's the hand of an angel
Take it down, it's always the hand of an angel
And bring up some of that modern
Some of that modern goodery that you brought
Chewie
It's always in the hand of the angel
If you want your drug, right
You get it from the angel
Mary mother, Jesus did
It's where she got hers

Mary purple fingers
You didn't know they called this mother purple fingers, did you?
That's a name of a junkie
You mean Jesus Christ's mother
The virgin
The holy virgin
The virgin mother
She was a junkie
Yup
And she got her junk
From the angels in the temple
I didn't say that
They said that in antiquity
It's in one of the apocryphal
Things that the church was like
No, we can't let them know that
But the thing with historians
And classical philologists is
We don't care
It's your
It's our evidence that we
You know, we're entitled to our evidence
Yeah, that's ours
Belongs to us, we guard
Those texts
Let's let everybody have them
Oh, this stuff that's going to come out now
Of the library

You know what I mean? I want to see blood
All the way up to the horses, baby
But first

Something
On their foreheads
Oh, god, is this
Gangsta or what?

You know, these
Divinities knew how to rock, baby
That's the stuff right there
It's too bad
Your religion, Christianity and Judaism
It's too bad your religions
Or religions of human sacrifice
That's terrible
You guys should stop doing that
Look
Yah, yah
The Greeks, they worked it
Out of the system
Right, that's off
That's off boundaries
When you kill
Human beings
To quench your thirst for blood
And
Resources and power
That
Is not classical civilization
Right, it's not classical civilization, brah
You don't kill children
Yah, I'm sorry
All you pro-lifers out there
Who are sacrificing
Children and have that blood
On your hands
Okay, I'm sorry
No, not really, I'm not
You're gonna wear that stain
You're gonna wear it
