A fury of mind
What else does this thing do?
It compels its users to
Exululare
Exululare
That's to make an ululation
But to do it in the Bacchic way
With head back
Isn't that wonderful?
Wonderful description
Look, they're making Bacchic shouts
Screams
Can you do the Bacchic scream?
You can do the Bacchic scream, right?
This drug will let you do the Bacchic scream
And what else?
Et pal patata e lingua similiter?
Oh, it gets a little bit gross here
I gotta put a rating on this
You guys better watch out
Because this gets pretty gross
It causes you to throw around your tongue
Just like someone whose head has just been cut off
Now, they are watching heads get cut off
In all sorts of ways
So apparently you had to be there
To see the heads get cut off
But apparently you got some funny stuff
That you do with your tongue
And when your head gets cut off
And these people who are in the
Minatic revelry
Enter into this stage
With the Toxicon
It's the drug that is used
People are saying, now wait
Okay, we're gonna spank someone
When we get back
But what I want you to do now
Is finish this gorgeous text
Because it is full of goodies
I want you to see a little video
That I've prepped for you
And this video will explain to you
In images and in song
It'll explain to you in images
And in song the direction
That Scrobonius is leading us
With his Toxicon
Yes, chewy, hit it
I can't see no future
For me in this world
And looking back on the past
If it's gonna be more of the same
Calling into the game
Cause I've had about enough of that
And they wonder why
I turn to the wine
I turn to the wine
Every time I get lonely
I turn to the wine
Every time that I do
I turn to the wine
And the wine
Turns on me
Agree
And the blues
Turn to darker
Blue every blue
And the blues
Turn to darker
Blue every blue
And the blues
Turn to darker
Blue
And the blues
