It's all in the venoms, man
I'm telling you, it's all in the venoms
Your history was created
By a group of women
Who were getting people to enter
Into death and life states
To be reborn with a toxic venom
A toxic venom
This is the heart of the mystery
And let's see what else
Let's see what else we can do with that
Toxic venom
That they're using on their arrow
I know that we can get there
If we milk those snakes
Can we milk some snakes?
So there we have it
What helps in these cases, Scrobanius?
Tell us, what can you do?
So you've had your taste of it
You've had your drink of it
And he specifies, this is for the ones
Who partake in the quotation
This is them, right?
It's the same effect it has
Hitting somebody with it on the arrow
But this is the paralyzing fear
That one enters into
When one is under the influence
Of the drug that allows you
To ascend into death
And to be resurrected
And what helps for it?
Well, you know, for those who drink it
It's, we need to, you know
Get some rose, some potable rose
It's interesting, some rose potion
Okay, get some rose potion
And is there anything else?
Sure, there's a couple other plants
But I want you to mix it with
Lactae et antidoto mistridatio
With milk and with the, again
Milk doesn't have to be milk
Like you think milk
But it says milk
So milk and the mistridatic antidote
Which is funny
And it makes perfect sense contextually
I don't know why classes don't use any of this
But it makes perfect sense because
The impernero is interested
In the very same antidote
So it would make sense that
Again, we're in a crime scene
We have to step back and we realize
That we're reading to you
The witness tonight is a witness
Connected with the legions
This is the highest of the high
You know, this is the first
And you're the last, right?
This is the one
And he is bringing the recipes
For the antidotes that are using
Conjunction with the pagan mystery communion
Yeah, yeah, fantastic
Right above that, you'll see ephemeron
And the recipe above that
You'll see ephemeron
That is what we call
Culturescene, right?
Yeah, we get culturescene from it, right?
Caucus
It's literally the Greek, just caucas
Right?
