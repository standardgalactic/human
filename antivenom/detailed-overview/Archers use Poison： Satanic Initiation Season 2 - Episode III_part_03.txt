So it's one of those ones
And be careful with that one
It tells you, you burn yourself with that one
Right?
You get quite burned up
I want to show you
I want to read to you
A little bit of Valerius flakus
I want to read to you
A little bit of Valerius flakus
And I want you to see
The
Working of the ancient magic
What is the person doing?
Okay, so we know that they're entering the right
And that they're using
That they're milking vipers
They're milking vipers
They're milking poisonous venomous snakes
In order to make
To add ingredients to these
Communions that they're using
Yeah, these potions
These compound
This compound drug
That ultimately will end up
Ultimately will end up with the
With the medwa
Now somebody was asking me
Do we know if they smoked?
And this is an old question
And one that I was just asking you
Do we know if they smoked?
They performed fumigations
They performed fumigations
Did they walk around with marborals in antiquity?
Is Claudius going to worry about his troops
Pulling out that he's responsible
For pulling out marborals?
No, he's not
He's got to be worried about them
Entering into fumigations
That will get them involved
In drinking things
And administering things evenly
And administering things
By incisions on the skin
And by performing things like this
Fumigation, you fill the whole room
It's like hot boxing
You just fill the whole room with fumes
Remember, your religions
Are based upon taking incense
And putting them upon a burning altar
This is where everything starts
Your western religions are built upon that
I can't speak for these
But for the western religions
They're built upon that
This burning of the incense and temples
Come on, Jehovah never lied about that one
He lied about a lot
But he didn't lie about that one
Pull down those temples
Where they're burning incense to those gods
Where they're entering those states
So breathing
Breathing this incense
Breathing this fumigated substance
Is that like smoking?
Yeah, if you're getting fumigated
You might as well be
You're a step up from secondary
That's for sure
You're probably classified as secondary smoking
Okay, that's neat
