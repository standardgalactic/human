Now, tonight, and I thank you
Tonight I want to finish with two people, with Rob and Snappy
And before we go to Rob and Snappy, I want Snappy to step up and give us a two minute presentation
On some of the things that are going on behind the scenes with the Discord
And what good news we've got from that, Snappy, go for it
Alright, thank you Amon, so first off the Discord has reached over 100 members
So thank you everyone for joining
And over a dozen of you have decided to either shave your heads or walk the path of Aphrodite
And as Amon was saying, big things are happening
Right now we are working at establishing our very own temple to the muses
First we're looking about doing this online
We have Dr. Buzzard who's working at making a wiki
And he's right now working on the Javascript for that
And there's also been discussion about recreating and developing our own order of the rose
The idea behind this would be to organize ourselves and to create a sort of fraternity but without those gender distinctions
We want to come together and form a stronger community and create some organization so that we can focus on this
Like I was speaking to Amon and we want to have people who are dedicated to the magic
People who are dedicated to archiving this
People who are dedicated to sourcing the mystery directly
People who are looking for Medea in other cultures and so on
There's so much that we can focus on and we'd love it if you guys all came to the Discord
And we could all pile together and work this out and start to organize ourselves a little more formally
Yeah, and excellent, excellent
And I can't tell you how much it means to me
The pool of you who are interacting now on this Discord are so aggressively reason-oriented
Yeah, just good pagan Satanist, you know, just the salt of the earth
This is how it should be
And I'm truly impressed and humbled
So Rob now has an idea for, you know, ideas for how the direction of the museum can go
And what it's my job to do is to step back and let the people who are just, we have such a resource of people here
That can really help design things and can open up this virtual space
Because you know that most of us have broken out of cults
And most of us are coming in that direction as reasonable Satanists
And most of us are necromancers at heart and want to raise the dead
And want to achieve something
So people have been asking me what is our goal and what is our mission
And I will just add this, if it is anything short of bringing back Lady Babylon
Then why would we do it? Why would we do it at all?
Rob, what's your vision of a museum? Tell me what you're working on
Well, I've been working on it for a while now
But in philosophical terms, because I haven't really, I haven't set anything up that is concrete
And if I'm honest, I need some help in setting it up
But where I had very early days, I had the idea of forming another discord
Which is more centered towards these episodes
Which features the very sources that are in the episodes
For people who want to go a little bit deeper and focus on the source material that are featured in the episodes
Just like a specific kind of nature, but also aware of the fact that that might offend the current discord
So it's been a slow progress because the discord as it is is fantastic
And it's not something that you could say needs work, it doesn't need any work at all
It's not that kind of expression where I'm trying to attain, what I'm trying to attain is some sort of special area
For people who really want to engage with the material what are in the episodes rather than
Because there's a wide variety of opinions, of varied ideas
And the brilliant idea, it isn't like you'd want to close that down because you should look everywhere for all your information
Your information should come from random sources, all sorts of sources
Everywhere what can spark different ideas and that's the nature of the discord because you're going to get all these ideas out there
And that's fantastic and that goes on, that's what's going on
There's also a more specific side that I personally want to address
For example, I'm going to use tonight, for example, we talk about the toxins on the ends of these arrows
And these arrow poisons and you'll shoot them into somebody and it has this dramatic effect upon them
And I want now is how you get from that point to rubbing it on something that's shaped like a dildo for an application in a ritual
That's where I want to go, I want to go into that, I don't really want to go...
Obviously it's a part of it that you want to go broader and you want to see the comparative differences
And also the areas out there are comparative and you can draw them in and say
Well, this culture is doing the same type of thing but that has got its own forum
There isn't a forum for that specific, well, you know, what's in that toxin that kills you
But can also be applied to the body in another way
And that's what I'd like to focus on to be clear
Yeah, so you can see, okay, this is perfect
You can see how Rob focuses in on kind of a refinement of an academic type of branch of this grand virtual...
I'm sorry, you see that's like people thinking oppositions
So it's like it's not an opposition to, it's a complementary side approach to an already successful discord
It's not meant as any sort of...
Getting what you want out of that discord because you are, you literally are
Yeah, and we're all coming at this from the same start
We're all coming at it from the same start
So it's just like you said, you need some help in how to design this, right?
