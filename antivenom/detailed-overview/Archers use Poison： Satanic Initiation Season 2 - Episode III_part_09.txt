But also what you can't forget is how bloody huge this subject becomes
It isn't... I mean, it's very commendable to want to...
What I wanted was focusing on the episodes
And that is monumental in itself
If you go... People will know and they will be doing this and going back through the episodes
And then they will be taking notes and they will be looking things up just as I've done
And you just can't... You've got to...
I'm sure then people will appreciate it how huge this unfolds
It unfolds and unfolds and unfolds
And when you try and fold it back up into a nice neat little package of explainability
It's almost ineffable
And that's a problem what we face is understanding to go into the minutiae of things is a good thing
But also coming out and having this overview
If you come out and you look at the overview and you look at the subjects you cover with the mysteries
It's enormous, I'm sure I'm messing up expressing that
But it's what I've found is you think you're moving forward and you think you're learning a lot
And then you realise how little you do know about this subject
And it's overwhelming that feeling
Because you get to a certain stage where you think I'm comfortable with this information now
And you understand this information
And then the next piece you go into, it can blow your mind and open up another column rabbit holes for you to explore
And that's what I've found fascinating with your work
You need to just start that spark, get them people to see that initial spark
And get what you're trying to put across
Because then you're on a roll and you just go with it
And I've been at this for two years, been at this for two years
And I don't miss a day, a day doesn't go by that it doesn't cross my mind
And I'm sure there are people out there who are experiencing the same thing
I just think there should be a place where this can be discussed
Especially the episodes and the broader aspects of the mysteries because you go on the discord
The current discord is enormous, there's subjects, it's fantastic
And that's the wide broad scope of what you can learn
And it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it never stops and you only realise how little you know
What's your opinion of that? And would you say that's accurate?
Well I think we're deeper than everybody else aren't you?
I think we're getting closer, if you're walking into that temple and it says hey, know who you are
Then yeah, the more you're saying oh I don't know and the more you're getting deeper into it
The more Bacchic you're becoming and if you forget you can write it on your arm
And you can say Bacchus says you don't know who you are, you don't know what you're doing
You don't know what kind of life you're living
If we can get ourselves to the point that we're free
It's not dependent upon a person or any sort of institution or any sort of dogma
It's a real freedom, it's a freedom you can't take away from somebody
You know, you can't, I don't care what you can tell me now
As soon as I've seen Jesus in the garden with the goop on his face
And oh God, take this cup away, right?
And there's stuff going on, there's cops, freeze, freeze and there's a naked kid
And swords sway and stuff, once you've been to that scene
And the crowd is like kill him, kill him
And by the way, those of you who are writing and saying you're blaspheming, you're right
You're right, I am, I am
In order to achieve that breakthrough we have to see Jesus Christ for who he was
He was a man arrested in a public park with a naked boy
When you go to drink of his blood and eat of his flesh
You are promoting a rapist pedophile
Your institutions are the institutions of rapist pedophiles
Your conspiracy queue groups are institutions that have promoted the greatest rapist pedophile of all time
You are guilty, you have that all over your skin, you have it all over your nation
You have created an association of liars who promote a man who was arrested in a public park with a naked boy
It's time for reality
Guys, thanks for joining me tonight
And I'm sure that the brains behind what's going on
There's so much brain snappy in this discord that I'm sure it's going to congeal
I mean, I don't want to step in the way
So to everybody that's involved, let's keep involved
And Hail Satan
Hail Satan
Good talking to you
