He knows it
Keep going
Why does Jesus always go there?
By the way, Judas has said
He is a bold guy
He is a bold guy, Judas
Didn't take nothing
Look at what's going on here
Christ is what?
You see the Christ there at the top?
You see it? What's he doing?
He's enjoying walks in the darkness
Wait, what?
Yes, if he had a profile
It would say enjoys walks in the dark
I'm not kidding you people
He likes to be out there in this place
It's across the little river
You go out there and you're all by yourself
And it's shady
It's dark
You can do things out there
He spends his time
What's he do? He takes his kids out there
He takes his children out there
You didn't think they'd arrest him with a grown-up, did you?
No, well Jesus got arrested
He got arrested with a naked kid
Here it is
Oh, great
This is the place he likes to go
So I want everybody to get out of the spaceship
Tonight we're in the garden
We're in the garden, right?
Who cultivates this place?
Some of these boys are on the inside by the way, you know
They're working with the priests
Wait, what?
They're working with the temple priests
Did anybody bother to ask the question of why it is
That young, nymph girls are guarding the temple?
Administering the temple?
Does anybody wonder about that?
Let's put it seems out of place, doesn't it?
It's kind of strange, isn't it?
For girls to be doing what this misogynistic society
And this misogynistic God want them to do
Is that what you want squeezed out?
You want that little unreality squeezed out there
Like a pimple
Like a pimple
Let's go
Go back to the text
Hang a ride at that star system
Fantastic
Here it is in Christ
Hang it out in that place, right?
That's where he goes and he takes his kids
Next one
Oh, and what happens?
There's a place where he's crucified too
Speaking of localities
There's a place where he's crucified too
And we all know the name is Hebrew
Nope, we don't
Unless we're trying to appropriate, we don't
What does the actual Greek say?
Go to the next one
That Hebrew, right?
What is it?
Look at the three
Now, what I've done here, I'm sorry
I didn't mean to yell
