I'm sorry, children
That's not right of me
I took a wrong approach
Look here, look
I got too excited
This is Al-Sonian
Syrian and Akkad
Wait, what?
Yeah, the three languages
You mean those three?
They're not speaking Hebrew?
No
They haven't been speaking Hebrew there for centuries
Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm
Do you know what's more popular?
Oh, the languages that are in the area that we would call
Well, part of it is Syria
But when they say Syria, they mean us, Syria
They're talking Chaldean
And why would you need these names in Chaldean?
Why would you need a bunch of Chaldean?
Hebrew is dead
Why would you need the Chaldean?
It carries the magic language
The titles are in Chaldean
Oh, my goodness, you say?
I thought, no, don't worry about it
It stretches all the way
Down to Babylon
It's okay that there was no Hebrew in the first century
It's okay that the temples are full
The synagogues are full of Greek
It's okay
It's okay, people
Right? Let's get down
Let's get down to the history
The real stuff
Okay, bring us that source
That next source, Chewie
Fantastic
So this is where he went with his students
So-called late at night
Right in the darkness
To be with his students
You know, it's either that or the fishing boats
Where the Peter's member when he's naked
Okay, and anyway
Somebody mentioned before
I'm bringing this first up
Because on the second line, this is for Deon
Deon, I shout out to Deon
Giving him, he asked about the spade on
Yeah, how much is it?
Look, what did Judas do?
He went and got the spade on
Right? And yeah, you could say cohort
Cohort, how many is in a cohort?
Well, a whole cohort is a couple of manifolds
Maniples, let's see
What's a manifold?
Oh, God, do you hear what's going on?
You're in the Roman world
You thought you were in the biblical world
You are not
You are in a backwater, crap province
In a world that looks so down upon this place
It tortures bad Romans
By making them the governor
Yeah, if you did something wrong to the emperor
If you had maybe, I didn't know she was his niece
Next thing you know, you're governing Judea
Oh, God, this place is uncivilized
