Don't you understand?
You realize the Scythian language is still being used
The titles that we have in all of the magic, they're all Scythian
Oh, my God, aero poisons people
Follow the technology, it's gorgeous
Let's keep going, it's gorgeous
Let's go back to the text, pull it
Here, and any who to answer for Deon
I don't know, it's a couple
A couple hundred per manapole, right?
A couple hundred per manapole
And what do they say we've got here?
We've got, let's see, see, see
It's anything coiled, of course
Oh, there we go, two centuries is a manapole, right?
Two centuries, okay
So centuries, a hundred, a couple hundred
But here's the problem, Deon
It fluctuates throughout, right?
It gets standardized at whatever at a specific time
And then a couple hundred years later
It's got a totally different composition
So what did, how do we know how many of the SWAT members
Came down to the guard to be with Jesus?
It's hard to say, he just got the cohort
It could have been a representation, you know
Could have been like a section of them, you know
With their heavy weapons, look, look
Can also be a guild, right?
It can also be a guild, but it's a tactical unit, right?
Now we're talking Ptolemaic
Woo, love it
Okay, isn't it nice how the odor
The odor of those Egyptian Greeks
Love it
Okay, let's look at his associates
His individual associates
As we take Jesus into trial
Let's look at this
So people that are associated with him
And we got our first guy up here, Simon
You know what a thug he was
Thug bulldog, you know, he's cutting off ears
He's like, you want to, you want to hassle us?
Cut your ear off
What does he do?
He's there
This punk kid is there for the questioning
And when they take Jesus in
He stays at the door
He stays at the door
Next to the administrative assistant
Who is a girl
Who makes sure
Who goes in, who goes out
Yeah, interesting
It's gorgeous
Let's go, let's go
Back to the text
Oh, Jesus, carrying a cross
Sorry, Chewie, bring
You can bring back Jesus in a minute
And what happened?
What happened?
Go back to the one before that
I need to go back to the one that I was just at
Oh, did we lose our navigation system?
There it is
Okay, so he speaks, you know
Peter's there
And he responds to this girl
Because she says, wait a minute
Aren't you one of his people?
