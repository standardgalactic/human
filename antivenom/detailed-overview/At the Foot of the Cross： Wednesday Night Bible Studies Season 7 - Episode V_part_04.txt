Right?
And what does he say?
Hey, don't look at me
Don't look at me, right?
And it says, here in the Greek
It says he's a little bit, you know
He's a little bit shook up
You can tell, right?
This is big stuff, man
We got Roman soldiers
All over the place, right?
This could go bad
And he says, oh, lady
Let me tell you what
Look at that last line
I am not a sun imporos
Of Jesus, right?
He uses his title, Christ
The one who has been Christed
Just like Medea was walking around with it
Yeah, he's, look
There he is
He says, I'm not a sun imporos
And you ask yourself, what is this?
What is that?
Tell us, please
Tell us, Peter, what you are not
Yeah, it's one who goes on board as a passenger
Okay, traveler
Traveler, look at the bottom
Trafficker, aha
Trafficker
What is the imporium?
It's a place where you traffic
You guys know that
And if you don't think it's connected
With the human trade
Look at the last line on section 3
Roman numeral number 3
There's trafficking and women
Trafficking and women
So what does Peter say?
Bring that back up, bring that back up
So what do you want to lose it?
Look, what is it?
He says, I'm not
I am not mixed up in the business
With this Christ, right?
Very, very specific denial
Very, very specific denial
Okay, let's go to the next text
Yeah, this is the Bible again
John again, yeah
So he's being questioned
And what do they really want to know?
They want to know about two things
They want to know peritone, mathetone
They want to know about his students
Tell us Jesus about your students
They just picked him up
Across the river in a shady dark place
At 4 a.m. with an angry kid, right?
And they're all standing around going
You know somebody asked, where's an angry kid?
Kid got away
There's, you know, he's running
Woo, little dude was fast
All oiled up
Right out of people's hands
What was Jesus doing?
Right, well look, right
This is no longer fun
This is no longer fun
