That's a kind of a really beautiful concept the Greeks have of entering into the temple
in order to find that place of healing.
You can take it down to find that place of healing and to come through a vision.
Yeah, you're entering that, right?
So we are entering a phase in that final eschaton, right?
The culmination.
We are, you know, the purpose, right?
This is one of Celsius's big arguments with the, with the Christians is that, you know,
the divine can't act contrary to nature, right?
So it's got to make sense and it's got to be according to, you know, what you see around.
It's got to mesh with what you see.
No fairy tales, right?
We don't, we don't follow that fairy tale stuff.
To jump to the Christians right away.
I want to introduce them now.
And for those of you who have come who know already, Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park
in the early hours of the morning and a pre-dawn raid, pretty significant, calls himself a child trafficker.
We're at that point now that we're going to, you know, we've got to come to climax here tonight.
We've got to reach the point.
So I want you to, we're going to get in.
We're going to see these drug users for what they are, what they're doing, we're going to smell, we're going to taste.
We're going to do everything that they're doing.
So I'm going to pull out Celsius just for a short quote, just for a short quote, right?
I just want you to listen to it talking about the Christians.
He says they are really very dishonest, borrowing even their incantations from other religions in their magic acts.
So there's a couple of things that are fantastic about that.
Number one, they're doing magic acts, right?
Right.
So, and number two, they are borrowing, right?
They're borrowing.
This is what drives them nuts.
They're incantations.
These are the incantations that the Christians are doing.
You're like, wait, wait, stop.
Stop the ship.
But, you know, wait, I don't feel good.
A little bit crazy.
It doesn't make sense.
Right.
Yeah.
The Christians are doing incantations.
Now I want to show you this video.
I want to launch you from Celsius to this living present.
Right.
To this living present.
We're just going to, before the ship stops completely, we're going to open the door and
get some air from, you know, just the recent past.
We're going to use that air to kind of fill our lungs and then we're going to step out
into that future.
Okay.
Hit the first one, please.
Chewie.
Jesus Christ, we invoke your name.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Thanks for having me, father.
Amen.
Amen.
First opportunity to stand up for our God, given on the honorable right.
Thank you, heavy Father word.
Community inspiration needed, please, police officers to allow us to go to this number.
To allow us to send a message, to all the terrorists, the Communists, and the globalists,
that this is our nation, not theirs.
Yes.
Oh, America, America waves and I say America to go down.
