blowing their horn the blah blah blah blah blah they're getting it you can feel
the ecstasy moving up and people come up and they prostrate themselves and they
enter that place right I mean we could put their pictures up on ancient walls
and it wouldn't change you know it wouldn't be any different how does it do
you think that this is a some sort of awakening what is this what is this
thing they're doing this is a this is a panic this is what happens when things
are in their death throws they're recognizing that the culture is moving
on and they're lashing out and they're lashing out with everything they have
so that they can reassert their dominance this is Chronos devouring his
children in paranoia that's what we're seeing here oh I like that that's why
excuse me I like that that's why yeah that's why oh god I love the image it's
like the struggling they're in the they know that their downfall is imminent
right because they can't they did this in the first century as well right and
people say no it wasn't Nero right I mean it wasn't the Christians that Nero
was saying the government was saying it's the Christians that burn burn the
city down and the Christians were saying no it was Nero right why I don't think
Nero was out setting fires scholars debate this and I'm like why are you
debating something that is so patently stupid right of course Nero wasn't
out setting fires and burning his own city down right this is the
conflagration that always comes it's a cleansing right the frenzy is maxed out
and I mean did anybody see the guy was wearing horns who's in the I mean you
can't get you can't get more ecstatic right in the name of Jesus right amen
amen
snappy tell me is it alarm is it being too much of an alarmist or are we
accurately predicting the future that we're we're on our way to another
insurrection right it's not going to stop because it's not going to stop it's
not stopping because right like I'm not an American but it's happening here in
my country too in Canada we're seeing the same kind of extremification you're
seeing the same kind of vilification of gender minorities look at what's going
on with Putin like you showed in the episode on Wednesday right Putin is
making this this change and he's making the new young people the enemy he's
coming at us with everything he has to try and assert that Christian national
control right because they're on the way out that whole methodology that whole
way of thinking it's dead it's old it's tired and it's stagnant it's it's time
for it to go right we got to castrate them yeah what do people think do people
I wonder maybe we can take a poll of the chat but do people think that that beast
is dead or dying we'll say die at least dying or is this resurgence of their
power I mean look they got to 30 they got to 30% and all the historians would
tell you you get a third of the population support you do anything you can
pull down your republic with just 30% report well support right so they
achieved critical mass they achieve critical mass and here they go um it may
be a while before somebody goes into Canadian holy space and desecrates it
but do you see that coming oh yeah so I used to live in the capital city of
Ottawa and I would have to walk by the Parliament every single day and there
are people who have been posted out there 24-7 with massive signs saying fuck
Trudeau and the world the world is ending and like we're gonna we need to
bring God back into Parliament and they scream and assault at people who are
just walking around wearing masks they blare terrible Christian music it's like
I've never seen this kind of level of antagonism here in Canada people don't
act like this here you know we're far more controlled about it but not any
more there's like this rampant fervent insanity and like for the first time in
a long time we're starting to see people who identify like this like we have a
far-right leader named Pierre Poilier who uses a lot of that language you know
he doesn't come out and say it but it's it's this polite way of talking to those
extremists he is a Christian nationalist by any other word if you really listen
you know and that's how these people are they manipulated and they're all about
power they do anything you know do you think do you think that do you think you
guys are getting that on your own or should I call should America call its
doctor and find out you know maybe what do you think we infected you or it's
always been it's a combination because we always were so interconnected to
America that whatever happens in America we have a mirroring effect here but I
also can't kid myself this kind of extreme conservatism and this nationalism
and Christian stuff has existed in many different forms in many different ways
since the since the colonial age so it's it's an intrinsic part of Canada as
well yeah that's why I always laugh when I read Jefferson all scared about the
Presbyterians right he was like no they're the biggest threat right now so
it makes me wonder if it's a what is it is it something in within the system the
program is running and it runs throughout centuries but it's got a
consistent it's got a consistent code in it that tells you abort and terminate
right and then all of the all of the it doesn't scare people that it's kind of
zombie-like I mean you know what I mean it's a little bit zombie-like isn't it
is it you know how okay question how how does it stop how do you stop something
like this if you're Roman in the first century right the answer is a crack down
a government crack down yeah right where you don't you you don't worship if
you're gonna tear stuff up we're not gonna allow you to worship you know get
out of here kind of kind of thing and you you crucify some of them and show
people this is what happens when you do this right you you can't we also see
the end outcome in room with that kind of thinking right that extreme kind of
