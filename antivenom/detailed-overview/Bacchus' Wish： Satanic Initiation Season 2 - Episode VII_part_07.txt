thinking that led to crusade again led to crusades against itself that's what
fundamentally destroys Rome right when the Catholics and the Orthodox divide over
ridiculous linguistics and philosophy and you know and that's what we're gonna
see with the with the with what's what's happening in America even you know if
these if they succeed in their mission they're just gonna destroy themselves
it's inevitable right we're seeing this hollowing out that's what's so ridiculous
right now is it America's attacking itself you've always seen that machinery
go out into the world and consume but now it's turned inward that's that's the
death rose well and that's I think that's why Tom is so angry because he said
it happens every hundred to 150 years right that it's cyclical so you know
here we are after the Civil War we're right at that mark where yeah this kind
of thing is gonna happen and what do we do are we unionists I mean I'm you got
the same thing in Canada same decision they're gonna have to figure out are we
unionists yeah to what you need to do is revitalize see we need to embrace
change we need to take on that new Dionysian energy we need to get rid of
the old stagnant and be reborn again and in a vitality and then have the cycle
replay right like we need to bring her back right it makes me it makes me know
that you know efforts in building the Tower of Babel are progressing because
that's really what you need you need some kind of universal communication for
the people to be able to respond to this cataclysmic effervescent you know
they're screaming in the video of the of the insurrection they're screaming
open revolution right they're screaming it they're 1776 here we go you know
they're and but what we also need to pay attention to there what it's this
extreme magical thinking too because when you listen to them it shows their
ignorance like they're talking about saving America it's like they're pissing
all over the Constitution even me is not an American knows them bringing God
into this and talking about turning it into a Christian anything is it's
totally anathema to everything the America stands for is it doesn't make
sense is Canada gonna stand with America as we go through this or I mean
there's no reason that it couldn't hit both of us and you guys end up having a
your your form of a civil war right I mean it's been 150 years for us maybe you
maybe you're in for a natural one as well and this kind of global you know it
only makes sense dude we're all over the planet now right so one one country goes
through this this ecstasy and starts marching out people of whatever gender
or belief that they want and and killing him or torturing him or stuff like that
you've already seen a parallel exactly happened along the same lines in Brazil
it was the same people following the QAnon cult they even tried it on the
same day January 6 too much the same results where the the military and the
police came in and just surrounded and arrested everyone they still attempted
they still walked into their holiest sites it desecrated them in the name of God and
the same insanity and like yeah I think right now we have Trudeau who is a
phony liberal centrist who just says what everyone wants to hear but what
we're seeing in Canada is this extreme fervor that I have never witnessed I have
never seen people hate someone so much and that is dangerous I don't know what
comes next but yeah we're not much better a place yeah see that's what that's
what I that's why I wanted to have a conversation from the beginning right
where are we right what can we rationally save and we're at a point where
there's gonna be some sort of tipping over and you know the secessionists here
in the States are gonna be loud enough and do something extreme enough to set
off that natural kindle it's there and they'll they're all saying they want to
right and the racists want to do it be for the obvious reason right they just
want the murder and the mayhem but the evangelicals are doing it because guess
what same motive right they have a plan for the end times and America's not there
if you listen to any of these preachers you were in the church you know I'm not
tell me if I'm saying truth or not snappy but they're saying there's no
America they're prophets they're people who are analyzing the prophets they're
all saying there is no America no America is always equated even usually with
some kind of phony apocalypse like they're gonna burn right America is the
is is gonna be it's it's everything has to be destroyed right you have to have
the Messiah arise in Israel you know this is the thing America's always gonna
be corrupt for this was always an intense thing among a lot of people in the
church that I went to is whether or not you even participated in politics because
politics was so corrupted and was the tool of Satan but most people did because
they wanted to enforce their judgmental agenda and others you know and that's
exactly what celsus argues celsus says the Christians are putting the devil to
use in that way just as a foil just as a foil if we have this huge eruption of
this ecstatic Christianity that's able to spill over and overthrow governments
overthrow entire governments it fulfills the evangelical understanding of
the prophecy that the United States is not is not in the apocalypse that they
have already been taken out and what's funny is the guy that has to exist then
and you just get this off of just go listen to some preachers right the guy
that has to be there then is the great bear and everybody says we know who the
great bear is who will come down to Gog and Maga it's Vlad Putin right so the
Christians are constructing their own reality around them and ecstatically and
we don't even perceive of this until they get into the capital and take a dump
and some senators get realized oh people could have died right and then we're in
the spot that we're in so I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had your your
overspillage yet because it makes me feel like maybe it was something that
