I never meant anything I said Just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' To keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant I never said the letters that I should've said
But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows When I say, never was a cause for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
Tonight we're gonna be lookin' at Mycenaean Drug Users
This is fantastic
We're just being bombarded
We're being bombarded by all this good evidence
All this hardcore archeology
Oh god, throw some science in there
Next thing you know
HPLC
Oh god, we're gettin' the samples tonight
We're gonna look at some couple of things
About Bronze Age Drug Users
And we're going to look at a very frustrated person through time
And we're going to watch the world develop a sense from that evidence
Despite his greatest, highest, loudest voice
We're gonna have a little clip tonight
Gorgeous little clip
A chance for us to hear some of the music of Zang Campbell
Definitely demon-possessed
Definitely
Certifiably, love it
And then we're gonna talk about some current events in archeology
And a little bit of pharmacology
And we're gonna start off with a little bit of Medea
So you can see who she is
I hope you were not too disappointed that Neil has become a little bit not feeling so well
And won't be able to make it tonight
We thank him for putting out the effort
Appreciate that, Neil
Hope you feel better
So tonight, whereas I was thinking about a conversation between me and Neil
It's gonna end up having to be a conversation between me and an invisible devil
So I want to start out with a couple of quotes
I'm gonna take you, gonna get in the ship
We're gonna go back in time
We're gonna land somewhere of 1200, 1100 BC
Talking near the end of the Bronze Age
We're gonna talk about one of these drug users
One of these drug users
Chewie hit the first slide with
I just want to read this to you
This is from the Orphic Argonautica
We start at the end here
At one of the gate posts there stood a statue of the far-seeing queen
Scattering with her motion the radiance of fire
Whom the caulkians propitiate as Artemis of the gate
Resounding with a chase
Terrible for men to see and terrible to hear
Unless one approaches the sacred rites and purification
The rites kept hidden by the priestess who was initiated
Medea, unfortunate in marriage
Along with the girls of Sita
No mortal, whether native or stranger, entered that way
Crossing over that threshold
For the terrible goddess kept them away by all means
Breathing madness into her fired-eyed dogs
I want you to make sure that you're getting an impression of
The time
Remember we're talking about priestesses here
And we're talking about a Medea
Who's the queen
And she is the one who is exercised in the right
Only she can do it
Right?
Her Citean maids
Are these exceptionally skilled
Workers in drugs
Scythian archeresses
Yeah, from across
From across the way
On the Black Sea
And these are very skilled, talented people
I wanted you to see that
I wanted you to see that she's named as that person
You can't approach this divinity, Artemis
You can't approach her unless you go by the way of the rites
Yeah, by the way of the rites
Now, I have been screaming at people about drug use
In the Bronze Age
And we've all been sitting here for the last four or five months
And we have seen that
There was drug use
Yes, there was drug use
Not just in antiquity, classical antiquity
But preceding that considerably
Yeah, drug use
And people tend not to pay attention
Well, now they're paying attention
And now we want to know
And it's funny to watch them
You can watch the evolution of the scholars here
As they go through the machinations
Of trying to set their mind outside of the paradigm
That they thought was reality
And now they have to go into another
So good for them
Good for them
It's a great experience
Thank you guys for doing that HPLC and whatnot
Yeah, fantastic
Second quote by Medea
I just want you to see, or about Medea
I just want you to see
The dream quickly struck terrible fear
In the heart of the king
He seemed to see on the lovely bosom
Of the young maiden Medea
Whom he was raising in his halls
A glistening star darting across its heavenly path
Which she, having taken it up on her robe
Brought to water of the fair-flowing fossus
He saw the star seize the maiden
And carry her across the black sea
This is the vision of E.T.'s
And that was more of the Orphic Argonautica
And this vision is preserved in multiple sources
And so we ask ourselves
In the first quote from the Argonautica
Who are the dogs?
You can't get in to see the secret
