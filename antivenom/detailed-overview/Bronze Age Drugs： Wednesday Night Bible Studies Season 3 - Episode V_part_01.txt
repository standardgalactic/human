Unless you get by the dogs
But she gives those dogs maddening poison
Right? She gives them maddening poison
Remember that
Maddening poison
Remember that we're talking about the Ioboloa
The hurlers of the poison
This is Artemis Iocchiara
This is Artemis who pours out the poison
Who pours out the communion venom
This is her
And you can't get there
You can't even get across the threshold
Right? Unless you've been through the mystery
You cannot get there
They call these the ahidni
The ahidni
Because they are priestesses
Who have been using the formula
Who have been using the toxins to alter themselves
Right? They're the Medusa
Now, I wanted you to see a little bit more of Medea
And what's going on
Maybe you have a little more respect for the knowledge
Because now the brides, you know
The scholars are always, they're always right there
I love it
You guys, you do it tremendously
A tremendously mediocre
And sometimes late job
You know, and sometimes even damaging
By giving us garbage
We don't want any garbage theories
We just want the evidence
Right? And everybody knows
The evidence now says from the hair samples that we've got
That the bronze age was full of drug use
Yes, yes, that there are drugs in people
Hallucinogens
And not necessarily hallucinogens that you want to
You know, go out and see a concert with
Right? Right?
So, yeah, this is serious stuff
Let's take a look at it
I want, before we do
I want to watch a little clip
Just two
Number one, to do two things
Number one, to remind you that we've been talking about these people
Using drugs for the last six months
And number two, to set your mind in that place
Where you can say, okay
How are these scholars looking at this evidence?
What are they doing with it?
Yeah, love it
Let's hit the clip, please
Oh, I could blame it on her
Or on him, or on them
But in the end, I made my own little help
And they wonder why
I turned to the wine
I turned to the wine
Every time I did lonely
I turned to the wine
Every time that I do
I turned to the wine
And the wine turns on me
And the blues turn a darker blue
I hope that set the mood a little bit there
Because we're going to be talking about how we got there
So this, as you know, the story's blowing up, right?
The story's blowing up
It's all everywhere from the New York Times
It's all over journals
I'm going to splash some of these up here
You guys have seen this
You guys have seen this
Here we go, here's Salon, Bronze Age Europeans
We're getting high on all kinds of drugs
Hair analysis study finds
Wow, that's fantastic
How about another one?
Here's one from CNN, my goodness
Look at that, that's central
3,000-year-old hairs hold the oldest clues
About psychoactive drug use in Europe
Fantastic
Here's one from the Greek reporter
Scientists discover evidence of drug use
During Bronze Age rituals
Okay, it's getting deeper, right?
We're getting in there
Tripping in the Bronze Age
Says the New York Times, right?
Love it
We're going to look at a couple of these in depth
This one, I think, is gross
I don't know why, but whatever that is
I know it's no offense to the Bronze Age dude
Or dude that who was wearing that
But I don't know
It makes my stomach turn a little bit
Direct evidence of ancient Bronze Age drug use
Found in Menorca, right?
So this is all off that Spanish island
Find that they've got with hair
And what they're looking at it
And I just wanted you to see a couple of quotes, right?
Direct evidence of the use of multiple drugs
In Bronze Age Menorca
One from Human Hair Analysis
Beautiful, beautiful
Archaeology, evidence of drug use
During Bronze Age ceremonies
Bronze Age ceremonies, they say
Bronze Age ceremonies, okay
Let's keep going
Here's a direct quote
The findings published Thursday
In scientific reports of the journal Nature
Great journal
Provide the first direct evidence
Consumed psychoactive drugs
Much like their pre-Columbian brethren
In Mesoamerica, the researchers said
Wait a minute
