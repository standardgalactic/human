Did he say brethren?
What was that?
I need that quote back
Here, there we go
Yeah, brethren, okay
They weren't really brothers, right?
I don't know where, you know, they're not even
Mostly related, right?
But, okay, who knows?
That's a nice ambiance
He's trying to create there, right?
Yeah, this is, he says
The first direct evidence
That ancient Europeans
Now, when he's saying ancient Europeans
He's talking Bronze Age, right?
And this is my frustration
If the classicists were on the ball
And I'll just throw it out there
This is not the first evidence
That we have of ancient drug use
Several of these articles say that
This, we finally have evidence
For ancient drug use
Take a step back, poindexter
Put down that slide rule
Put it down, put it down
The words that you're using
To describe all of these drugs
They're already talking about in detail
And we'll see this as the, right?
Apparently, this is amazed, but here's the problem
Classists don't like to go there
Because classes, and you can ask him
Ask him all, ask Bart Erman, right?
Because people watch him here
Not because he's a classist, he's not a classist
But, you know, ask Carl Rock, right?
This stuff has been sitting in this literature
For a ton of time
And nobody reads it
Thousands of pages on drugs
I can even tell you what was on that hair
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
You're gonna, the benefit of coming tonight
Was that you get to be one step ahead
Of the rest of the world
One step, just one
Let's do it, let's do it
Yeah, here's the main doc
Who's ahead of it, right?
I'm not quite sure, I'm sorry
At least if I've mispronounced your name
The lead author of the study said
Researchers were stunned by the results
Now, wait a minute, nobody's stunned, guys
Just wait, especially because the cane interiors
Yielded no tangible signs of drugs presence
Myself, okay, well, they didn't
They had it in their hair
But not in their pockets
Okay, fine
A chemical analysis of the hair revealed
Evidence of three alkaloid substances
What are those alkaloids?
Those are those nitrogenous substances
That have some kind of physiological activity
Yeah, human body, they can be antifungal
They can be painkillers, you know
You're not gonna get to chase the dragon
Without alkaloids, right?
Alkaloids, nice family of chemicals
Yeah, known to produce altered states of consciousness
What they find, ephedrine, atropine, and scopolamine
And for those of you who are, you know
Just somewhere on the periphery, neuroscience
You might be a neuroscientist
You might be some molecular biologist
You know, maybe chemist
Maybe an engineer, right?
And you might be familiar with some of this terminology
You know that these substances are not
These are not lightweights, right?
Atropine and scopolamine
That will put you into a vision state
That the magic I use to torture people to get information out of them, right?
Yeah, that's what these people had in their hair
That's what they had in their hair
And they say, we're stymied
We're surprised at this, I don't know why they're surprised
Yeah, especially when the Greeks are documenting all of this
And you say to yourself, oh, give us the evidence
We're hungry, I want that evidence
I want your evidence
Give me that evidence
I'll give you my evidence
Just all you gotta do is go back to Homer
I was talking with Neil today
And Neil said he interviewed a PhD
And the PhD got his PhD in New Testament studies, right?
And then he went back and got a master's degree in classics
And he said he didn't realize how full of nothing was the Bible studies degree
Isn't that funny?
Because he went back and got a classics degree
They brought him up to the evidence
And I know you're hungry for that
My audience is hungry for that evidence
Give me the evidence
I got Homer
Let's call up Homer
And you say, wait a minute, where are we?
Don't worry
It's 9th or 8th century
B.C.
9th or 8th century
Yeah
We're only a couple of centuries away from that
Ending of that Bronze Age
We're talking about the same generations
Homer is harkening back to this Bronze Age
And he is saying in it
They're on drugs
What do you mean this is the first evidence we've ever had?
What are you talking about?
Go to the tax
Oh my God
