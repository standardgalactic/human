You can't have a party
In the Bronze Age without getting there on drugs
And that's what the scholars are so worried about
They're trying to make sure
I'm going to show you these quotes
They want you to know
They want you to know this is not for fun
This is not for fun
No
I want to take you out back
I got a place for you out back
Come on, let's go
It's okay
Services are over
Come on
Come on
We got to take off the uniforms anyway
You know what I mean?
They want to take you out back
Homer is talking about the drugs
You have a giant party where you have people over
You douse them in drugs
Drug-laced wine
That gets them so bent
That he says you could kill their mother or father in front of them
And they wouldn't care
Now, vice news
Thanks for the bid on the scorpion smoking
Get out there and look at that
If you guys haven't seen that
The place that takes you
Is a place that they're going backwards
Back and forth to
To enter these places where you can interact with
The powers that be
Real sorcery
Real sorcery
I love it
Let's keep going
Which one am I on?
The author suggests in the presence of these alcohol
It may have been due to consumption of some nightshade plants
Such as Mandrake
Now look
I want you to notice as we're reading these
These are all of the suspects
The usual suspects
You could look in any
Inquisition documentation
You can watch the trials
You can see what kind of testimony you can get out of them
These are the drugs
The standard list of drugs
They are always catching the witches with
Always catching them with
What do we get here?
Mandrake
They also use Mandrake, by the way, in surgery
In antiquity
Cool, huh?
Henbane
Highest sky on this
That's what they call it in Greek
Name
For all you people who are surprised
All of you scholars
I'll give you credit
You guys are out there digging in the dirt
And you're getting the evidence
Who are?
I love that
But look here
The Greek name for the drug you found
Is sitting right in front of our faces
Highest sky on this, right?
That's all you gotta know
Did they know about these drugs?
Yeah, did they use them?
Of course they did
And they wrote a ton about using them
That nobody shame on the classics out there
One more time
As a Ronan
I wanna say this
Today is my last
I want the world to know
That the people in classics
Have let you down
That they are dogs
That they are not the guardians
Of those sacred words
That they have lost their right
To call themselves
Defenders of the muse
Shame on you people
There's literally thousands of stuff
That remains untranslated
Cause like my dissertation
Like the head of my department told me
When I was giving my dissertation
She said
The Romans
They just wouldn't do such a thing
I was like
Are we talking about the same people?
Are we talking about the same people?
Have you seen what the Romans do?
Yeah
Okay, let's keep going
Cause I wanna get to Jesus
I wanna get to stabbing Jesus
We're gonna get there
This one
Yeah, here we go
Hang on, no, I'm gonna read this one
Henbane and thorn apple
Right?
What else?
Joint pine?
The author suggests that these drug plants
May have been used as part of ritual ceremonies
Performed by Shaman
Right?
No, it's still all run to that
Right?
Now, we're getting outside the evidence
