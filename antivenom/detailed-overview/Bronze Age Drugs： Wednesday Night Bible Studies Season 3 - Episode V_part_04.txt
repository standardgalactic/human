Right?
And what do they use for evidence?
The concentric circles and the wooden containers
May have depicted eyes
Okay, personally, people
That's it
In my scientific opinion
Having worked in a lab myself
That doesn't hold up
Come on, guys
You can do that
That's the best you scholars can do
I'm sure there are people right now
Who are writing a book
Probably for Rutledge
And I'll bet you can look at all these pots
And they'll say
This is the psychedelic experience
No, you can't make conclusions like that
Then it's not how you use evidence
I wouldn't hold up in a court
You think they would convict someone on a murder charge?
Based on the big googly eyes and the pots?
Yeah, your people grow up
Why don't you just read your texts?
Why don't you just read what the people that came after them
Said to do with the drugs?
I don't know
Maybe that's an idea
Helen is putting drugs in the wine
Cersei is drugging men
She's got the dildo rod
She is drugging men, man
This is an operation
This is big stuff
These are crazy poisons
Right, love it
This stuff will get you going
And people are shocked
Oh, we found hair
We found Bronze Age hair
And in this hair we found drugs
Do you know how frustrating it is?
Step back for a minute
Step back for a minute
I have been shouting to the world
I've been shouting to the world
Carl Rock has been shouting to the world
His whole career
And people look at you funny
Now you've got hair
You morons
Now you've got hair
And now you see it's there
Yeah, finally
You don't deserve it
You don't deserve to know what the Caesars were doing
You don't deserve in the cult
You despicable
Athenian women weren't staying indoors all the time
Shame on you
Shame on you
You pretend to write a book
It's disgusting
Open up the pharmaceutical stuff
Let's see where it goes
You'll have to forgive me
Clear distaste for academia
But I was known for that
As a graduate student too
And I would always bring that
They were like, oh, Hillman's here
He's gonna bring up something nobody knows
Read the tax people, it's all there
Let's keep going
This is exciting
The researchers noted that
The dangerous nature of the alkaloids
Found in the hair
Using and handling these substances
Required specialized knowledge and expertise
What a bunch of geniuses you guys are
Yeah, congratulations
Congratulations, if you'd read the documents
They talk about what specialists you have to have
Just to procure these drugs
Much less to make the compounds
And what to do with them
Some of this stuff is great
This is a, you know
And remember, Bronze Age
The glory time
That's when these big cities are getting built
That's when what you and I call civilization
That's when it's thriving
It's only afterwards with the dark age
They don't know what happened
It's an island blew up
And people invaded
And, you know, famine
And all that kind of stuff
They don't know what caused that
But we went backwards
We know that the people that were associated
Just think on this for a minute
The people that were associated with the advancements
Were the ones who were actively performing the mystery
Whereby they were exposed to the drugs
Yeah, I love it
Let's go on, next quote
Where are we?
Julie, get us here
Good
Drug use among humans
Is a practice known to be thousands of years old
Based on clues that were previously uncovered
In Eurasia and the Americas
But in Europe, the presence of mind-altering plants
At prehistoric sites offered archaeologists
An incomplete picture until now
They lacked evidence that people in ancient communities
Ingested the plants
Oh, by the way, it didn't ingest them all
There's a lot of where they eat this stuff
Medea invented the vapor bath, they call it
The vapor bath
