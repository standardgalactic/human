In that article
We found this lover of cannabis
And he had the...
What's the point, Poindexter?
The point is that he had the
Scopolamine and atropine
Or he didn't have the atropine
But he did have the scopolamine
So these chemicals are being liberated
And used
You know what the point is?
Fantastic
And they are terrible hallucinogens
You can put somebody into a state
Of complete total psychosis
And now you understand
Why we've been talking about
All these caves
All these caves
Dells give me a little more time
Than I, right?
These caves
And why they're going into the caves
Right?
It's where they found this stuff
Is in a cave
Right?
So there's got to be some
That's why they try to bring in the
Bring in the shaman
Just dirty
He probably smells bad
I bet the shaman's underwear are dirty
How much do you want to bet?
This one?
Fantastic
But the dire...
Oh, yeah
This is...
I want to read you
I wanted to get into a little bit of
A little bit of...
We're talking now about
Bronze Age drugs, right?
One of the areas
That people don't talk about
Are the Venoms
They come up all the time
On the witch side
They come up on the midwifery side
They come up on the oracular side
You got an oracular priest
Who were writing about
Oh, God, this is a great combination
Of X, Y, and Z
And you put this in and bam!
Right?
This stuff is great literature
There's more on theriax
As a matter of fact
I'm going to scare you a little bit
I hope I do
I was reading just this week
In a place that hasn't been translated
From Galen
He's writing about theriax
And he says there is a theriax
That is peculiar or particular to
The house of the Caesars
Yeah, it is their family mystery communion
Yeah
Do you know who Julius Caesar
Put a portrait of
In the temple of Venus, Genetrix
For those of you who are not in the know with Rome
I'm sorry
I don't mean to point
That's rude
But for those of you who are not in the know with Rome
Venus, Genetrix is our mother
Excuse me
I want to put my bracelet on
Venus, Genetrix is our mother
If you're a Roman
You know you're a descendant
Of Venus, Genetrix
Who does Julius Caesar
Get a portrait of
And set it up in the temple of Venus, Genetrix
He gets a portrait of Medea
He gets a portrait of Medea
Because the Kid and I know
Yeah, I've seen things
I've seen things
And I keep screaming about them
No, I don't scream about them
I just wrote papers
And went to conferences
And wrote a book
A couple of books
And now people are seeing
That the stuff is there
Let's take the next step
I was going to show you some texts
But I think we've gone beyond
Let us be satisfied in this
In this world
Where the drugs are used
In medicine and in health
And are a big part
Of the development of the religious
Attitude of the people
Yeah, these drugs have a tremendous
Tremendous influence on society
And the mystery as started by
And perpetuated
Through the Kalkians
Eventually, all the way
Through the Etruscans
Right?
How do we know?
How do we know?
This is what they're going to be
Finding out in the future
I told you I would do this
So they talk about the hair dye
