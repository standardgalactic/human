We've got this red hair dye
Right?
Yeah, here we go
Here we go
This is the ferric oxide
Ferric oxide and where do you find this stuff?
You find this stuff in the Limnian Earth
You find it in what they called
Limnian Earth, Galen went to Limnos
To find this stuff
Because he claimed that it could heal
Breast tumors in women
Now he said other things about it
But that was one of the things
That caught me as a grad student
What?
Yeah
And he would
It's something special
I gave a paper on this
And people speculated about
What it could have been
In the Limnian Earth
Well, this stuff is also
A base for a dye, right?
It's a base for a coloring agent
You can make paint with it, right?
And what they would do
Is they would put it
For example, today I was reading a priest
Named a candor
Who said, look
If you're out and you get bit
And you don't have your coating on
It's your fault, right?
Your dermal coating
There are paints that you can put on
That will deactivate poisons
Yeah, very practical
If you think about it
Yeah, you can see people developing that
That makes perfect sense
Just like that stuff
The Medusa, the temple guardians
Put in their hair, right?
Did they drag their arrows across?
And then their arrows are poisonous?
Same kind of approach
It's a very naturalistic approach
It's why the world
Monotheism
When it encounters that world
Is on shaky ground
It's not flexible enough to absorb that
That nature, that pure exercise of nature
Right, stop, what you're doing
And that's where we get the Frankenstein
Well, it turns out that this substance
Right?
I'm going to pull up this in Greek for you
It's called Miltos
Miltos, red earth, right?
Red ochre
I guess on the Brit sign
They call it Ruddle
Ruddle, right?
It's this red lead
Or this oxide, right?
And notice that it's from Lenin
Look at Roman numeral number two here
In this Victorian classical philology
Paradise Island
Eurusive
Eurusive
What is Eurusive?
Oh, wait a minute
That's the rust that grows on the wheat
And hence, it is a title that we give to Demeter
A title, an epithet for her
Is this rust that grows on wheat?
And so, right away, I know
The neuroscientists out there, right?
I'm thinking of one in particular
But I'll pretend like I'm speaking to a group of them
You all know now that
Oh, okay, there could be a connection with the
Ergot and the LSD
Because it's that rust, that wheat rust
It's a fungus that produces the right stuff
You can paint that stuff on your skin
As well as put it into a barley meal drink
Right?
If your barley's rusted, right?
You can put it into a drink as well
Or you can put it on your skin
The Etruscans like to put it on their skin
You ever seen Etruscans?
They have, like, red skin
And you're like, what's that?
Right?
It's not because their colors were messed up
Right?
It's not because they...
We don't understand
Do you see how bright red that stuff is?
There's no way
Right?
What is that?
That's artificial
Yeah, no, it turns out it is
And we have descriptions of applying these things to your skin
And the dyes are huge
The dyes are huge
They called Hercules Porphyrian, right?
Because of the purple dye that he's marked with
And where is he getting that?
He's getting it in the mystery
And the only one allowed
Is the Herculane Mystery
Who is a female
One has a vagina
Has the black harbor
Right?
Medea alone is allowed in the right
So when the scientists
Dig up the hair
