Greed stains your soul
Oh dear, Athena Belisema, do you like the hash?
I got the creeper reefer, we eat spaghetti for silly hours
I satin with the fruit and veggies of the cornucopia
Here, have a little taste, sip it wine, iron flavor
I got the bag of amethyst
Don't bring up, root cutter, new singer, Athena Lover
Got the lavender by the box full, oboe rigatoni coming through
High off the contact, it sounds nice, fruits of labor all night
The moon rise, dragon queen taking flight
I spun away from the treeline, hip-hop will make you feel fine
House of Frankenstein, Wolfman, charm time, root cutter
Don't bring up, Phoenix rising, that's how the devil rise
Don't bring up, root cutter, new singer, Athena Lover
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
I want you to know tonight
I just want to give you some intimacy for your brain
I love it, I love it, you know what's happening?
We're getting out there, we're getting out there
And do you know what's happening?
It's causing people to become angry
What kind of people are these?
The people whose souls are stained with greed
Congratulations, Satanic congregation
You have done it, you have done it in ways that you may not even yet understand
Congratulations, everybody involved, congratulations
Thank you, Teddy Bates, for the music tonight, for the intro and the outgo
I appreciate it
You can think of those as your hymns
Those are modern hymns
And we have our Orpheus, isn't it nice on the ship to have an Orpheus?
That's very nice, it's very nice
We have another person who needs a little bit of shout out
And that is Alderboy, because his series on the Purple is out
It's a great movement forward for the museum
Isn't it nice in the discoveries, just come out of the ground
There it is, the Purple
What are we going to get next?
I've told you what's coming
Tonight on Lady Babylon, we're going to take a look at some of your most deepest intimate secrets
We're going to bring them out and we're going to burn off your mortality
Doesn't that sound nice?
Burn off your mortality
If I was ever going to go to a priest, S
I would tell you, I would go in there knowing that she was going to burn off my mortality
God, how did religion become so unattractive?
How did it become so unattractive?
Tonight we're going to take a quick look at the Dove, MÃ©tis
Tonight we're going to look into a leucis
There are a hundred gazillion of these profiteers in the universe right now
Profiteering, it's important for everybody here to know
Lady Babylon is not monetized and will not be monetized
Everybody needs to know that's part of the contract with the devil
The esoteric vision evaporates
The muse leaves the minute I sit here and do this for money
Isn't that amazing?
True religion has the high standard
True religion has the high standard
There will be no passing of plates, offerings
We don't take offerings here
Do you know what that gives me the power to do?
It gives me the power to reach into the deepest, darkest cess
And pull it out and throw it in your faces
God, that real cess from the cesspool
Are you guys ready to go there tonight?
We're going to dive in deep
I want to see something
I want to see something
Did somebody say Penelope?
Somebody wants to see Penelope
Bring her up, Penelope
Thank you for coming tonight on demand
Please show us your cross
Show us your cross
Beautiful
Get the pollution out
We're going to find a place that hides a multitude of sin
Multitude
Hit me with the first couple
I've got to mention a couple of things that we didn't mention last time
That I want people to really jump into
Isn't this gorgeous?
Look at this word, people
Let's just start out with a beautiful Greek word
It's a beautiful, sexy, lovely Greek word
Look at this, Afron
Afron
What is something that is Afron?
It's without its frame
It's without its frame
It's without that power to perceive
It is senseless
It is senseless
It is frantic
It is crazed
Crazed, okay?
What a wonderful word, right?
Afron
Now, imagine
Look at the bottom there
What's it say?
Afron equals Goneon
What is Goneon?
That's Himlach
That's Himlach
Do you know what you do
When you've had a hard day
You stop off at any of the taverna
That lie in the street
And you go in
And you get yourself a Himlach tari
And if you drink too much of them
They're gonna open
They're gonna find you in a state
Where you are crawling on all fours
Look, he's doing the Himlach walk
Oh, what a time
What a time when Bacchus flowed through the streets
Remember those
Oh, God, you gotta love it
Give me the next word
We're not done
We're not done, right?
I'm just kidding you
Before we get out into the cult tonight
I want you to partake, people
Here's everybody partaking
Of this mental gorgeous drug combo thing
We've got going on
Look at this
Goneon is your Himlach
That's great
I didn't lie to you
Look at number two
Narthex
What is a Narthex?
What is the Narthex?
No, seriously
Seriously, what is it?
It's a tool
It's a tool
In it
Is carried the fire
That's the fire of salvation
The Narthex carries the fire of salvation
What were they actually doing with it?
What is it there for?
It is full of symbols
Now, come here
Come here
What's her name?
Who'd she write that?
I don't know
She was writing about myth
Some Brit
Now, that's what you deserve
All you myth writing
That's what you deserve
We don't want the myth
We want the anthropology
We want to know what they're doing
With the Narthex
Hit me with the next one
Hit me with the last drug
We're going to pump into their mental
Into their brains
Now, give me the next one down here
Boom
Boom
What is this drug, Galen?
That we've been talking about
Look in the very middle
It's an on-oldunos
It's an on-oldunos
It takes away your pain
Does everybody feel like
We've finally come to the right church?
This place is wonderful
This is a synagogue
I can be a dog about
Oh, look what they're giving us
They're giving us the painkiller
God, if I got painkillers
Every time I went to church
Look at you
Trapped in that tiny cube
That tiny cube
