How would you like to wake up
And your daughter runs out to you in the morning
And you're cooking pancakes
And her name is beautiful justice
Come here, beautiful justice, right?
Do you know who the last goddess is?
To abandon mortals
Zeus is already gone, right?
Ares, he doesn't care anymore
He's out, right?
All of them gone
Even Eros is gone
But the one that always stays
To abandon mortals last
Is decay, justice
Justice, the test is people
Will you defend justice
Or will you take paola?
Isn't that funny?
That's the one thing justice hates
More than anything, paola
Paola, does it stain your soul?
Does the paola stain your soul?
Where's your cross, Christian?
What is your cross covering?
Didn't seem to do a good job
Terrible, terrible
It's sad
The history of Christianity is sad
What is the next daughter's name?
Clay C.D.K.
That glorious justice
Demo, the people
That's a nice one
And who's their eldest?
It's Khalithawe
Khalithawe
Oh, and she of course is the, you know
The progenestate
She's that really the first born leader
Give me the next one
The first born leader
And who are these?
I'm sorry, who are these goddess-like girls?
They are
Can you show the image?
Do you have the image?
They are the four girls
That came to the well
Where Da Maitre
Was sitting by herself
Because she had lost her kora
She had lost her kora
How did she lose her kora?
She took that narcissus, ba
She turned into it
Did you see what happened?
She went straight into the underworld
And do you know what Da Maitre wants?
She wants to bring her back
Okay, do you understand you're in the cult?
Do you understand the priest?
She is saying to you this song
There is a creator
And that creator sings
And this rite is a plug-in to that muse
Okay, okay, how do we get there?
How do we get there?
Is there a, you know, we're supposed to just all sit here
Sit here in the pew and feel the guilt of our conscience
With the blood of the cross
Covering us
God, I looked at her again
Back to confession
Nobody ever confesses
That's the problem
I confess you have driven me absolutely mad with love
Confess that
Good, let's go
What's the bridge, people?
What did he just say?
I think he just took a wrong turn
Yeah, no, it wasn't a wrong turn
It just didn't plan on going there
Look at this
What is this whole thing about?
I know an antitomon
I know an antidote
Wait, you mean there's words for antidotes here?
Within the hymn that we've been singing
About what Medea, excuse me
What Demeter, excuse me
What Lucifer is going to do to that child
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Go to the next
I want to show them a couple of these words
That are so important
I know a remedy, right?
I know a remedy
I know some kind of antidote
Now, for those of you who are curious
That last reference in Greek under A
Is Pindar's Pythian Ode, number four
And that is a preserved oracle from antiquity
Given by the great Medwa, Medea
The one we call Medea
It was given by her
And she said, within a certain number of generations
This dude is going to go to this place
And he's going to found a colony
That was handed down to the Delphic oracle
This is all historical
There is no myth
This is historical recording via
Which is cool, via the oracles
People think the oracles were song and dance
Because everybody here
And here's the whip for everybody tonight
Everybody is bad
Even the sisters of frustration
That's what they come for anyway
Right? He's so clever
Mmm
Just thinking about that frustration
Just thinking about that
Makes me want to undo it
Makes me want to undo it
Yes, yes, see?
Thank you, Troy
Yes, spankings for everyone
Now, we have free spankings
Satanic congregation
Do you have to give any money?
No, but they will spank you
Yes, yes
Okay, go to the next one, please
I have...
No, go up to the one above that
What I wanted you to see here
Is that Pindar's Pythian Ode
Preserves this vocabulary
And it does so in kind of an elegant way
By preserving the oracle
You thought history started with Herodotus
Right? You thought, oh, he's the first dude
To sit down, dude
And write out his stuff
And say it on the porch of the temple
He'd be like, dude, tell his stories, right?
Cool, Ionian
That's super Ionian of you, right?
No, come on, man
We're stupid when we look at history
He wasn't the first historian
Do you know who was passing on history
And governance at the same time?
The oracles, the smart women, you boobs
The smart women from the ancient world
The smart women
Powerful
I was in a meeting just yesterday
With a couple of very, very
Fantastic, you know, people
And, you know, a scholar I truly admire
And we were in a group meeting
And they started to talk about
The idea that women didn't have
A voice in antiquity is hilariously bad
It's hilariously bad
And it covers up a real
It covers up a real woman-led
I'm not gonna say matriarchal
Because that's not the kid
Grown-up, crone model
The different Greeks are not using that
That's a fantasy of people
Who wanted to take you into a back alley
Yeah, that's a fantasy of those people
Made mother-
Made mother-crone
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
Even the guy-eye
The supposed crones of antiquity
Are said to be never aging
That they're always in bloom
