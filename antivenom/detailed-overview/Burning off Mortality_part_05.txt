Blow it up
And look who the source is on the end

Uh-huh
You remember what he looks like
You remember what he was acting like
He was stumbling around
And he was paranoid
You know
Yeah
It's a Christ thing in the eyes
For some reason
I suppose that, you know
The chemists can work it out
People were mad
I don't know what the indole broke me
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Somebody said on the internet
I'm a chemist
I'm not a freaking chemist, dude
My science side is bacteriology
And I studied infectious disease

And by the way
There's traffic out there
People are plotting
People are plotting the end of almond
