Pinched my cheeks
This is for them
Stop being that way ladies
You got to be a little bit, you know, direct
Oh
God
Paideraste
It says it equals a paideraste
That's their way of getting around saying
Well tell me, what is a paideraste
Then I'll play your little game
It's a lover of boys
Mostly in a bad sense
Does it sound like
A dictionary that you would
Read in the English language
No, it doesn't sound like a dictionary
What is that, that's a Victorian sentiment
Right, the guys are looking
Around like not me
No, no
It's mostly
In a bad sense
Yeah
Okay, now you know
What the paideraste is
And yes, we get our English word
The Christ
Is in the position
Of opening the eyes
That Christ
Is the paideraste
This is a direct
Link
Between
The definition, the classical definition
Of a paideraste
And the performance
Of the Christ mystery
Yes, now why is this, remember
She, da meiter
Is a curotrophos
What does she do, she nourishes
The curos
And sexuality
Is part of the process
Because
She is the paidophile
She is the one
Who expresses the love
For the curos
Oh, okay
The great mother, right
Da meiter
It's just mother
God
Mother Zeus
Da
And remember this is
Centuries, oh god
There's 1500 years before this
When these rites are being performed
Before Christianity
Before Moses was ever a figment
In the imagination of the
Hellenistic person
Who created her
The Hellenistic author who created him
Yeah, yeah, fantastic
Go to the next one
Oh, there it is
Boom, now tonight
We're going to switch gears now
I'm going to stop with what I showed you
And I just, because this is making such a splash
I want to reinforce this
Because this is one of the points that I bring up
That have gotten people
Just crazy mad
And you love it, you love it
You love it
But apparently there's a lot of people
Who are very upset at the idea
That the Torah
The Jewish holy writings
Were originally written in Greek
Apparently that's a, that's, you know
It's quite undercutting
To the whole narrative, right
It takes Moses and Abraham
And it turns them into
Fictional characters
From the third century
That are using the culture
Of the mystery
To create a
Honest reform
Of religion
Yeah, aka Judaism
Third century BC
Uh-huh, with all the synagogues
What did all the synagogues have in them?
Ion and the zodiac
Do you guys know your zodiac?
I had to learn the zodiac stuff
Yeah, yeah
Now let's not go crazy with it, right
Let's not go crazy with it
Kai, Apen, look at verse 3
What is this? This is Genesis
So tonight
I'm gonna start doing this at the end
I'm gonna just give you a quick flash
Of how incredibly
Terrible the Hebrew translation
Of the Greek is
Right, tonight they're making up words
Just to be able to suit Greek
It's hilarious, watch this
This is Genesis
This is Genesis chapter 11
Yeah
And what's happening?
We're around the time of
You know, we're looking at Babel, right?
Right?
Oh God, and a man said to his neighbor
Dale, Dale, Dale, get over here
Plain Thales, Solomon, Plain Thos
Let's fire
Some bricks
Now watch this people
Let's fire some bricks, just think about that
Just think about that
Simple little statement
Let us fire
Bricks
Okay, cool, because they're gonna build something
There's nothing, there's nothing
Look what the Greek does
Look at the end of the second sentence
Plain Thales, Solomon
And then the beginning of the third sentence
Plain Thos, do you notice that those
Have the same root in them
The Greek loves to do this
And has been doing it
For a long time
By the time this document comes up
And because this is Hellenistic
Greeks were trying, especially
We're associated with the museum
They were trying to kind of elevate
The Greek back to what it was
Right? They're trying to
They're bringing a lot of vocabulary
It's highly, highly specific
But they're also stylistically
Trying to harken back to that old
Fashioned way of doing
Greek where you take two words
Put them right next to each other
That have the same root
Usually one is a verb
And the other is a noun or an adjective
Right? It's just the way
It's just what they like to do, dude
It's their style, right?
And so you Plain Thales, Solomon
You prepare a brick
Or fire a brick, and what are you firing?
Plain Thos, those bricks
Right?
Oh, what?
Just tell me, what does the Hebrew do with this?
What does the Hebrew do with this?
Watch this, people
The fact that people can say
This is a total joke
Look at the first word up here
I just do the making of the bricks
Right? Lebanon
Lebanon, let's see what that is
Let's see, are they, by the way
Are the bricks related here?
Right? Is the baking related?
Let's see, let's see if it's from the
