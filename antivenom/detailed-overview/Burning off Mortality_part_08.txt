What's going on?
What kind of terms are they using
To translate this?
To make a brick
Or to be made
To make whiter
Okay, so the Hebrew is using a word
For the baking of the bricks
That's a primitive root to become white
Okay
Okay
To
Make bricks, are they doing the thing
Where you've got the same?
Let's see what happens, same base
Give me the next one
So, what is the word
For brick? Wait a minute
Lebanon
This thing, just like the Greek
Is using the same root
This thing
Lebanon
Which means to be white
But also a brick, which by the way
Seriously
Seriously, you guys
I know you don't
I know you know this
Is not the best work
I know you do, look at this
Look at the linguistic laziness
Give me the next one, this is terrible
They need to be told
Take a look at how classical
Philology works
What's the problem here
So it does have the same root
The brick and the brick making
But look what happens
The word for rock that he's about to use
It also has the same root
And it means a stone
Okay
Okay, what's going on?
Now we've used
Three
Words with one root
In them
What is going on?
What's it mean at the bottom?
What is the word for stone?
It's the word for, it's used for a charm
Wait, what?
Cornerstone?
Death?
Oh my god, this is a made up word
Look at how many places they plugged
Look at how many holes in the wall
They plugged with it
Differing weights, hailstones, jeweler
There's about 50 words in Greek in there
Lapis lazuli
A plum line
Is it a brick?
Is it a rock? Is it a plum line?
Is this which going to hit me in the head
With a brick or something? Where am I?
What you're seeing here
Is one language
Inventing itself
In order to translate another
And that's the secret
Of Greek and Hebrew
Hebrew is an attempt
Ancient Hebrew, not modern
Ancient Hebrew is an
Attempt
To translate
Greek
It's an attempt to legitimize
Itself through the behemoth
That was there
Dominating with its
1.5 million
Over 8000
It's the history of
The world, man
And it's gorgeous, you see
At this point I can make out there tonight
It's that we look at history
Through the wrong
With the wrong
Direction
We look at it the wrong way
We should have been looking at the languages
We should have been looking at the languages
Because the languages preserve that
Reality
And this is the reality that's here
Ancient Greek has the clothes
You're right
You're right, Jesus Christ sick
Jesus sick, Christ sick
I don't know what that means
I don't know what that means
It's scaring me
Go to the next one
Look, another brick and another title
That's fine, go to the next one
There's the word for burning
I was going to talk about that a little bit
That's okay, I don't need to
The point has been made
Go to right here
By the way, there was something
In this process of making the bricks
Stickiness, put them together
Right, some kind of mortar
To put them together and the Greek says
You got asphaltos
Right, wait
Asphaltos
Does that sound familiar?
Yeah, it does
What is it? It's asphalt
Bitumen
Kind of petroleum, it's pitch
Right, it comes from sphalo
The very word for it comes from a Greek word
It's just got the alpha-private on the front
It's sphalo to deteriorate
And asphalo would be to be
Not deteriorating
Not being destroyed
It's asphalt
Now, give me what the, how does the Hebrew
Come up, give me the next one
And I just want you to see, look at this chart people
This is all the different
This is asphalt with all the different
Manifestations of
Look at how common this word is
In ancient
That includes coin
Look at how common it is
Look at how many different things it's got
Holy mackerel
It all comes around
Is this going to say treacle?
Love that stuff
You know that stuff? There's a well
Never mind, you Brits will get that
Give it the next one
They didn't say it was smart
That's the point
Watch this people, what does he do?
What does this word mean?
What does the Hebrew word mean?
That they're translating asphaltos for
Himmar
Right, and what did they say?
It's bitumen, that's
Bitumen is the Roman word for asphaltos
Right
And then they just put asphalt
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Yeah
This is amazing people
Right in the definition
You want to know where this word comes from
There's two classical words there
To explain it to you
And it's being used for centuries
Before the Bible
Is ever written
Now, people like
Dan will tell you
Dan and Kip
They will tell you
There's a wall of separation
Between Christians and everybody else
And these words will not come across
Right
Oh God
Right, this is why they don't make
