Smug
Athena Bellosema, do you like the hash? I got the creeper reefer. We eat spaghetti for silly hours. I sassina with the fruit and veggies of the cornucopia. Here, have a little taste. Sipping wine, iron flavor. I got the bag of amethyst.
Don't bring up, group cutter. You sing up, Athena lover.
Got the lemon dug by the box full. Bo-bo-rigga Tony coming through. High off the contact. It sounds nice. Fruits of labor all night. The moon rise.
Dragon queen taking flight. I spun away from the treeline. Hip-hop will make you feel fine. House of Frankenstein. Wolfman. Chom-chom. Group cutter. Don't bring up. Phoenix rising. That's how the devil rise.
Don't bring up, group cutter. You sing up, Athena lover.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon. This is initiating apocalypse. It's gonna burn tonight. It's gonna sting.
You're gonna love this. What I've got for you is just, just prime material. Tonight we watched that smug sink. Oh, God, isn't it gorgeous to live in a time when you can watch the smug wiped off of someone's face?
Welcome back, Satanic congregation. Chewie and I have brought you something together tonight that I think you're going to really like. I think you're really gonna like this.
It's gonna require that we look directly into the mystery, directly into that ancient source of human religion, the place that was the birth of all, all that you and I call divine.
Let's look right into the heart of it tonight. Tonight we're going into the mystery. And I want to start by saying we will see Gnostic informant at the end of my presentation and he'll have some tidbits for you and, you know, some things to sprinkle in some sources and we'll get going.
Let's not waste much time tonight. I want to jump right into it, but I want to set your mind as we're getting off the spaceship here. Here we go. We've penetrated time and space and here we're right through that wave.
Bring it back right to somewhere sacred. You know what? I'm bringing you tonight right off the bat. So, those of you who aren't on the throne, get on it. Tonight I'm going to bring you. This ghost is incredible.
And what I'm going to bring you is the singer. I'm going to bring you the Bacchic Priestess. I'm going to bring you prime. Are you ready for this?
Okay, you know what? Do we put the spray down in the ship for the Bible scholars because I don't want any of them creeping out of the corners or anything.
All right. Hit the first one, Chewie. Boom! Look at this, people. Who do I bring you? I bring you the voice of the black Sphinx.
Look at it, Greek students. Look at that first word, Sphinxos. Gelinase. That's the black Sphinx. Who is the black Sphinx? This is real, people. This is real. Look at it. Look at it. Who is she?
She's the singer. We're going to have her voice. Yeah. What is going on? The priestess is becoming. She's mimicking black Sphinx.
Who's the black Sphinx? This is going to be some sexy, sexy stuff. Hold on. Give me the next one.
Here she goes. Are you ready? Are you ready? What virgin muse? What pedo-killing Italian?
With her song is going to put us into a place where our flesh melts, where we fast. Are you ready? You thought you were coming tonight to the ceremony, right? No, she's here. She's here. This is her. And what is she doing? She's taking that away from us.
We're with the initiate. This is Lycophron. I know that's a name that nobody knows. Lycophron was probably the most difficult of all Greek authors. And I'm talking from Homer all the way up to the Byzantine stuff, like 1100.
This is very, very exquisite. You know, Lithica aside. Archaic, Theriac aside. This is top dollar. This is, oh my God. Oh my God. Hit me with it again. Hit me with it again. Are you ready, people? Listen to the voice of the Bacchic priestess, because that's who's singing.
That's who's singing. Are you ready? Hit me with it. Yeah. What sort of thing are you going to see under her influence? You're going to see the Theroplastondrakinen. You're going to see what the beast-shaped serpent.
And what is, what else, priestess? What else? You know, what is not going to escape you? We're going to put those Throna, those drugs. You mean this is a word for drugs? Yes. It is. It is. And I'm not talking about Thronos.
I'm talking about Throna. I know they sound alike. They sound just alike. Slight difference in tuning. That's all. Just, ooh. Okay. It's a drug. It's a drug. And what does she do? She ing-ku-ko-san. Those drugs are mixed into the barley. Wait a minute. Look, I know there's people out there and they're raising their hands. And here, this is for you, naughty people. Don't get so excited.
Oh, that's just a start. Who is it? It's the Kakaian. Wait, what? Yes. You ing-ku-ka-an. Something. The drug. You prepare the drug and that's what she's doing for us. And what is it going to give us? Look at the last line.
What is Keira? You don't want to know. In that cup that she's got for you is your doom. Isn't that great? What do you mean? The Keires. Who? You know who these are? These are the beautiful, beautiful sisters who take your soul and cut it out of your body.
Oh, God. You're going to meet them. You wanted the right people. I'm showing you the right. This is from the lips of an ancient priestess. Thanks to a just a great, great nerd, Hellenistic nerd, Lycophron. Thank you, Lycophron.
Thanks to Pindar too for preserving Medea's own words. Hit the next one, Chewie. Ready, people? Watch this. What is that thing? We're talking about venomous beasts, people. There's an eota there, right? Just creeps in like that. We're talking about venomous beasts, especially serpents. Do you know why Mo held up the serpent?
Because he was so deep in this cult. He was talking. He was talking to Zeus. Oh, God. How many years is this before Moses? Moses comes up in the third century, right? Fourth century, third century. First time we ever hear about him. Who's that guy? I don't know, right? It sounds like that guy, Museus. Wasn't he around at the same time? Yeah. What are they doing over there? What are they doing in Alexandria?
So, before Moses showed up, this is the model on which everything of your religions are hanging. It's a privilege, people. Satanic congregation is a privilege to show you reality. It's a privilege. Thank you. Thank you.
Give me the next one. Watch what happens, people. Where do we find that voice? You know, who has that voice, that Gheirun? It's Kohida. Look at that first word. You should make mental love to Kohida. Look at the accent, Kohida. It's gorgeous. Who is that? That's the one they call the Medhwa. She's also the queen of Babylon. She's she of many names.
Here she is. You didn't know that that's who is performing this right? That's who is bringing your initiation? You thought it was on one level, and now it's on a bigger level. That is exactly how the Baqic right opens the eyes. You see who you are. Who is this? Who is she? Who is she? She's the daughter of Yiti's.
Look at what she is. She's a kure. What is a kure? Someone who is in the bloom, in the bloom. Divinity does not age. Justice never aged. She's the same now as she was 2,000 years ago. Isn't she gorgeous? Yeah. Yeah. Justice never ages. Hit it. This is the Greek mind.
