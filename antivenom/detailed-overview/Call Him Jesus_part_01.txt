This is the mind from antiquity that preserved the classics. This is that mind. And don't worry. Nobody knows Lycophron well. Classicists revere Lycophron because Lycophron is extremely crazy with his vocabulary.
Well, who? What? There's a hop ox tonight that we'll look at. Oh, God. Constructor. Imagine a muse that could pull out of the emptiness reality. That is the power of the poet. Love it. Love it. Oh, there. Who is that the Alos? Look at that. That's the Alos. Couple of crosses on there, but that's the Alos. You know, it gets my goat.
That we, that we cannot put up anything that is classical, that is of a nature without some force sweeping in on us. Yes, but that's okay. As long as you people are out there watching and complaining, we will put the crosses up for the sake of their viewership.
Yes. What we do, it still gets my goat, Chewie. What we do is we look into that cross of Christ and we say, what does it cover? What does the cross of Christ cover? It's a multitude of sins, Penelope. Look at you, Penelope. Give me the next one, please.
Go away. Give me the next one. Boom. Watch this people. You know that voice that we were talking about? There's about 50 words for voice and antiquity. These people, the Greeks, they're nuts about voice. When your language that you speak on a daily basis is a song, this is going to happen. It's inevitable. Did you know there are two types of people in the world? You did.
There are those who sing and those who don't. Imagine if all you were doing was singing. Oh, God. Oh, God. Yeah. Remember, 8,000 ancient Hebrew, right? Ancient Hebrew. Just give your language 8,000 unique words. Ancient Greek, 1 to 1.5 million.
It's time we sing, isn't it? Look at the name Morpheus here. I just want you to see that. What is this thing? It's the voice of passion, this particular voice. Look, they put some dirty Welsh up there, right? I don't know how to say that. Where's all boy? All boy, get out there. He's chasing down the purple. He does the Welsh stuff too. What is this? Tell me, oh, it writes me and how do you say this kind of thing?
Shout. Shout. What kind of shout? The voice of passion. Oh, God. Now, bring me up. The sisters of frustration. This is a voice that is foreign to you. This is the source of your frustration. The voice must find a way out.
Or its concentration is so strong, it just causes you to explode. Yeah. Can you feel it? Ladies of frustration, let it out. This one's for you tonight. I know you like this. I know you like this. Please, please write me another screen.
That's, you know, you could work on those a little bit. That was nice. Don't you love the sisters of frustration? People, for those of you who want to think about grifting, right? Somebody said I was a grifter. Do you see any super chats here? No, you don't.
Do you see me making any money on Lady Babylon? No. Why? Because I have an agreement with the devil. I take a penny. I lose. I lose the inspiration. That's the way it is. That's the way it is. It has to be pure. It has to be pure.
You know what is a sign of your age when you suspect that your age is dark ending is when people who are something project it because this is prison. This is hell.
And do you know why they're here? They're here because they're polluted and they will project that pollution as punishment. Don't you love that? This place belongs to Satan. Hail Satan. Love it. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Hit me with the next one. Oh, you got to give him something. We need the dope tonight, people. This has got to be the really good dope. Give me the next one.
Okay. Muse, thank you very much. Can you tell me, Cleo, can you please hone in? What is this passage that you're looking at in front of you? This passage is from the book of Numbers. From the book of Numbers. It's the only biblical passage we'll look at tonight. But I want to throw it to you really quick.
Verse three, chapter, I think it's two. I don't remember to be honest. And the Lord, he heard the voice of Israel and he gave them, right? What did he give? He gave them the Canaanites to be under their control. And what did they do? What did they do?
They anathematized them and their city. And what do you mean? They anathematized. This is going to be hard to look at, right? We're going to take their cities and everything that's in them. We're going to destroy that stuff. Anything of value we'll put together for later.
Give me the, give me the next one. I know it's dark people, but when you're sacrificing to that dark divinity, right? You have to have blood, right? Remember Abel, he's like, dude, Cain, won't you sacrifice? And Cain's like, shut up. I have to farm.
He's like, no, he's just, let's take that goat and cut its throat to our God. And Cain was like, shut up. You know what I mean? You know the rest of the story, right? One time too hard. Cain was big, man. Been lifting those bales all day. Boom! Right on him. Got him good.
Anathema. What is anathema? Watch this, people. I'm going to show you a divide. I'm going to show you a divide between languages. Remember, history is all language. Anathema. What does it mean in Greek? This is what, this is what we're doing to people in Canaan, right?
Palestine, in antiquity. Palestine, we're talking about. What do we do to them? We wipe them out. Women, men, children, from the youngest to the oldest. Is that what anathema is? No, it's a dedication. On the Greek side, it's a dedication. You see, this concept isn't from the Greek culture. This is uniquely non-Greek.
And the language shows it. Look, curse. We're going to curse. We're going to commit to justice. Give me the next one. But how is this word? Where do we find this word? Look, here's the verb, right? Devote it to evil. Wait a minute. What? Devote it to evil.
Look at every reference, right here. Every reference here. That's in blue, right? Until we get to Edius. How many references? One, two, three. We have three from the Septuagint. What are we talking about? We're talking about a Hellenistic use of a word that is ancient, that meant to curse. And how are they going to change the use of that word? Give me the next one, please. Watch. Are you ready?
It's just from anathema. What do you do when you anathema something? You lay a burden upon you. You attribute something to someone. You dedicate. It is a dedication. It is not what you're about to see. But this is what it becomes. Give me the next one. This is what the historical narrative is trying to teach you from the third century.
Here are all the Greek roots for blah, blah, blah. Give me the next one, right? Here is the word in Hebrew. Look, it means to ban, to devote, and to exterminate. To what? To exterminate. Give me the next one.
These are exterminations that we're calling for. Why? Because you're devoting those lives, the people that you are destroying. You're devoting them to your yahoo, to your God. This is not Hellenistic. It is not Greek. Give me the next one.
Oh, God. Here we are. Most often of devoting to destruction cities of Canaanites and other neighbors of Israel, exterminating inhabitants and destroying Andor. I'd put an Andor. Andor appropriating their possessions. Yes. Yes. It all depends on how much you destroy, you know. What can be salvaged from the purge?
Yes. That is historical. Non-Greek, right? The text that is the Septuagint is the Greek, and it's preserving something from the culture of those who are writing it that is foreign to the Greek. Isn't it gorgeous?
Isn't it gorgeous? It's like jeans. On the end of those jeans, you know, you got little codes. Take off here. You know, this is the end. Right? Cut here. Clip here. And then put a loop together and pow. You got some like that, you know, monster that does stuff in the cell. It's gorgeous.
Give you the next one. Oh, God. Isn't it beautiful? Okay. Now I'm going to give you one long text and then we're going to turn away from text. I'm going to tell you a story tonight. Is everybody ready? Here we go. Thank you for coming tonight, by the way. 620. Thank you all to every one of you. Every 620 people out there. Give me a big hug. I love it. I love.
And there was in those days, right? It came about that Jesus, what? He went from Nazareth and Galilee, and he was baptized in the Jordan River by John. Right? And what happened? And immediately coming out of the water, Aden. What does Aden mean? It's a third person singular. It means he saw. He saw.
This is not a crowd of people. This is not John baptizing him. Although John knew this would happen. It's not John. It's him. He's seeing it. He goes into the water. And what does he see? What does he see? He sees the uranos ripped open. And he sees this dove coming upon him. He's all freaking out. And what does he say? What does he say? I'm hearing voices.
You mean Jesus was hearing voices? That's what it says. Look at verse 11. This voice out of the uranos. What happened? Just spoke to him. Said, you're my son. You're my moochie-coochie-poochie son.
Agapitos, right? It would be affectionate, but it's kind of inappropriate because isn't this the Christ, right? And he's all like, he's in the right. It seems like it's a little bit, you know, but whatever.
Whatever it's dad and son, and one of them is totally knockered on something John gave him. The baptism people, baptism comes from a word to die, to stain with drugs.
Yeah, to stain with drugs. Give me the next one. Give me the next one. Boom. What is this? And immediately the spirit threw him out. Where do you go when you're under the influence into the Eremon? Eremon, Eremon.
