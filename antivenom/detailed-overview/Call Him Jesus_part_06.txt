Exercise. It's good exercise. Exercise it. Give me the, give me the token back.
Give me the, go, go, go. Boom. Just the next one. Chewie.
Therionarche. That's what I need.
That which benums, right? Wait, what? That which benums? Serpents?
God, I told you the dragon. I told you the dragon was coming.
Do you have the therionarche? Do you notice the narche on the end of that?
That's where we get our word narcotic. Narcotic.
Can you believe that in Anglo-Saxon, you can't even invent a word like narche.
You can't even get the word narc that we have for killing pain.
Catch you. Oh, God. Look, look, look at the, look at the, look at the Anglo-Saxon.
Oh, I'm going to kill pen.
You see those guys trudging around those bogs, right? And they're all stinky, big old hairy armpits and everything.
Oh, my God. Give me the next one.
Therioplectus. Struck by a poisonous animal. Good, good. Let's get through these.
Theriotrophos. Oh, God. Oh, my God. What does this mean? A bounding in wild beasts.
You know where you go to be with these things? You go to the eremon.
That's where you go. That's where they all hang out.
And what is Therio to make into a wild beast? Did you know tonight we're going to make you into a wild beast?
Yeah. You may meet Jesus at the right. He may be out there too.
Oh, devil. That guy is freaky.
He gets way out there. He gets so gone. You should have seen John turning into a beast.
Turning into a beast. That's what we need. We need Jesus and his crew turning into a beast.
This is where beasts feed. Therioplectus.
What is that? It's where beasts feed. Now look, people, in the parentheses, because nobody ever believes me until they go to the Greek.
Look at the eremosune. Eremosune. What is that? Do you see the eremon in there? Do you see it in there?
Half beast. Do you know why they call centaurs, centaurs? Here we are.
Chewie, this is what I was trying to get to. I'm sorry. This was a terrible organization tonight for the people.
I'm sorry, people. Give me some love, please. In the chat, tell me it's okay and you love me and you won't leave me.
Dirty, dirty people.
Phaedomingues. What does that mean? Half beast. That's what you use of a centaur.
Now, in the fairy tale, we get to the modern age and we're teaching mythology.
Somebody in some Brit... writes down a little book.
Oh, this is our mythology. You morons. Centaurs.
They no more thought that there were half horse, half people than...
Oh, God. Oh, God. What are the centaurs? Can you show us the centaurs?
