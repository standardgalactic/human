What is a centaur? Chewie, it's the next one. What is a centaur?
You've got some... first of all, when you're Thedomictus, you're mixed up. You're with a daimon.
Did you know that? Did you know that? That's a daimon. That's a power.
That's a power. Guess who the author is who's telling us these things? Lycophron.
Lycophron. Very, very difficult. Very, very difficult.
Stop. Stop. Chewie, go to the back of the ship for a minute, please.
And tell Yoda to get up here.
Thetoplastos changing into beasts. Who changes into beasts? We'll get to the...
Don't worry, I'm going to show you the centaur. Who changes into beasts?
People get forcefully changed into beasts by Cersei.
Why? Because she has the drugs to do it.
You mean Jesus Christ and his Seder Buddies who are out there?
You mean those people are working based upon the magic of the drugs of the family
that are called the daughters of the son, Cersei and Medea?
Yeah, no, that's all coming from them.
It's science, people. We build on science. We have Nobel Prize winners for a reason.
You build your society on these advancements and in the Bronze Age.
This was the biggie. This was the biggie. Give me the next one.
You know what it means to have that beast in you? What does it mean?
When you're under the influence and the beast is in you, you're in the Eremon.
You have that brutal mind. You didn't know that Jesus was intentionally putting himself into a state of brutality?
Oh my God. Oh my God. Why? So he could take on the shape, the therialmorphic shape.
The therialmorphic shape. I don't think we put those in, Chewie.
I don't think we did. I had a bunch of slides. I think we missed them.
That's okay. Sometimes we're on. Sometimes we're not.
What is the therialmorphic thing? Look at this little thing.
Look at this little thing. Codon. In the form of a beast. What is a codon?
A codon is a bell. Look at the very bottom. Dan hates this.
The bell of the maycone. The bell of the poppy. The bell of the poppy is therialmorphic.
Yeah, we didn't bring them. What is the centaur? Go ahead and put up the rest of your pictures, please, Chewie.
And I'll finish up. What is the centaur? The centaur is that beast who is the paideraste.
The paideraste. Do you didn't see that tonight, did you?
I thought I put the paideraste in there. I guess I didn't.
The pedarast people. A centaur is a pedarast. And who is the medwa?
She is the pedarast killer. The pedarast killer. Isn't that interesting?
