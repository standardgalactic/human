I'm delighted to be able to come to this assembly again, this unholy assembly.
It does me great, great pride. I am going to force upon you the soul of one Carl Jung and from Carl Jung
We are going to make a deeper dive into the actual magic that was guiding Carl Jung and his mystery.
Excuse me for one minute.
Carl Jung
Carl Jung
Without further ado, Carl Jung, please.
Carl Jung
Carl Jung

Carl Jung
After the second prayer, you will see how the disc of the sun unfolds and you will see hanging down from it, the tube, the orange of the wind.
And when you move your face to the regions of the east, it will move there. And if you move your face to the region of the west, it will follow you.
And just like that Carl Jung was sucked into Saturnian vision and where did he end up?
And incidentally, I knew, I knew, now this is it. This is the vision of my patient.
But how could you be sure that your patient wasn't unconsciously recalling something that somebody had told you?
Oh no, quite out of question because that thing was not known. It was in a magic papyrus in Paris and it wasn't even published.
It was only published four years later after I had observed it with my patient.
We can extract it from Carl Jung. He's bad and he deserves it. He deserves what he gets.
The Lieber Noeus, the Lieber Noeus, the new book that Carl Jung wrote and then had buried until a certain time to be released, which has been released.
And scrutinized by every sort of critic authority, academic, you name it.
Let's look at it with the eyes of the Bakant.
If we really were in charge, if we were in control, if we were sitting on the throne, for those of you with fears to hear.
If we were sitting on the throne of Satan and we were able to reach into his capacity to bring past teacher and present into one moment, we would be able to take Jung and magically transform him.
I want us to go where Jung tried to lead.
I want us to look at what they call the Liturgy of Mithras.
Yeah, the Liturgy of Mithras. What is that? That doesn't help. I want to get down to the level. Remember the timeship?
I want to get down to their level and see what's happening.
Okay, so I'm taking you tonight on this merry Christmas night.
I'm taking you to the place where all of this comes from.
I'm taking you to an actual cult ritual.
Now, word has it that the profanation or the making common of the cult ritual of the Mysterion will cause instant lightning.
From Zeus upon the Revelation.
If I'm bathed in that lightning, I will know the Ion.
Let me show you that drugs can make you high or according to the magical papyri, they can make you cosmic.
Let's look at the ones that make you cosmic.
And again, let's remain scientific about this.
I have no theories for you. I don't want your cash.
I don't want charged you to ask me a question.
I don't want any of that corruption or pollution.
I just want the text.
And tonight I want you to look as you were gale with a series of images.
I want you to look at Mithras and the Liturgy.
And I want you to ask a couple of questions here.
I'm going to read to you just the introduction.
And I just want you to follow along in your mind's eye.
Be gracious to me, O Providence and Psyche.
As I wrote these mysteries handed down, not for gain, but for instruction.
This is what Jung was referring to.
So when we look at his magic book and I show you how to use it and break the seal, absorb the seal, then don't be surprised.
Now watch this. This is gorgeous.
Yeah, he's invoking, right?
It's a prayer.
Yes, I don't write these things for gain, he says, but for instruction.
And for an only child, I request, I think it's a bad translation because it's monos.
Remember my advisor, Dr. John Scarver was one of the translators in this text, in this work.
And we oftentimes scrutinize translations that it's just so difficult.
I can see the translator's difficulty, but you know, it's tough.
It's tough.
So here we go.
Yeah, not only child, but I'd say one.
I'd say one child.
So and for an only child, I request immortality.
That's what we're doing here at the mystery.
We're burning off your mortality.
Welcome.
Yes, welcome.
Oh, initiates of this one power.
I refer to you.
It's nice.
Which the great God Helios Mithras ordered to be revealed to me by the archangel.
There's directions in here to a little an assistant.
What the Romans called an honest.
Yeah.
What are the instructions?
Furthermore, it is necessary for you, oh daughter to take the juices of herbs and spices.
Which will be made known to you at the end of my holy treatise.
He's going to say which drugs it is that she is supposed to produce.
Right now.
Wait a minute.
I said it's he.
I said it's he.
Why did I do that for no reason other than I've been living in the society I've lived in for the last 2000 years?
Yeah.
Why can't this be a she?
It would make sense.
Wouldn't it?
It might as we read it.
You might begin to see all of that stuff that I told you about the midwife was there for a reason.
Yeah, we're burning off the mortality of the flesh.
Yes.
And why are we doing this so that I alone may ascend into heaven as an inquirer and behold the universe.
Get my cosmic vision going.
Okay, so wait a minute.
Where are we?
I just stepped out of this time shipping into the middle of some kind of rave.
Yeah, exactly.
So this is an operation.
Historically, this is an operation and we're about to get details.
We're going to get invocation and we're going to get details about what to do.
And I want to read you a little bit of that because there's lots of drugs and there's lots of things.
Lots of seeing things.
And there's lots of comprehending the universe.
Yeah, of knowing oneself.
He say, oh, is this another introspective?
No, no, no.
