What?
These guys are attached to Jesus.
Give me the definition, the next definition right up there.
What does it mean to occaluth or something?
Right?
What does it mean?
It means to be joined to it as if you have a duty or an obligation to serve it.
They use it of soldiers and slaves.
Take it down.
Soldiers and slaves.
Uh-huh.
These are Jesus's boys and God help the person who scandalizes, who captures, who traps those
boys.
What I have taught you says, Jesus, I want you to pass on boys.
Yeah.
Peter, you know what I'm talking about, Peter?
Okay.
He's about to pull it out.
He's about to pull out his Cosby.
Are you ready?
Let's go to the next one.
Here we are.
Are you ready?
So this is Matthew.
So Peter was, you know, he was sitting there.
Oh, outside of the gate.
Yeah.
Outside of the gate.
What's he doing?
Sorry.
The courtyard.
He's in the alley now.
He's in the alley.
He's in the courtyard.
And he's, what is he doing?
Yeah.
He's a little Pideske comes up to him and she says, hey, hey, you're, you're one of those.
You're one of those who's with Jesus of Nazareth.
Now what is a Pideske?
Please tell me Jesus is sitting.
I mean, Peter is sitting there in the courtyard while Jesus is getting hammered.
Right.
Nervously.
And Pideske walks up to him and says, Hey, you're with Jesus.
What is a Pideske?
It's the next definition.
Yep.
No, not that one.
There we go.
Yes.
Perfect.
Sorry.
My eyes.
I need to put on my glasses.
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
Bring me that up.
Thanks for putting up with everything.
Look, young girl or maiden.
What's a, we don't use term maiden anymore.
Right.
I don't.
Um, young female slave.
Bond maid.
Right.
These people are not there.
Um, you know, just working.
This isn't just their job.
What else is she?
Look at number.
Look at number two.
Prostitute.
Prostitute.
Yes.
A Pideske is a young girl prostitute.
Isn't that nice?
Now they don't always have to be involved in sex.
Right.
They don't.
But we know the temples and we know what the Pideske does there.
And it's what you and I would call prostitution.
And one of these prostitutes recognizes him.
Young one, a girl, a young girl.
She's like, I know, I know that guy.
He's with Jesus in the gang.
You know what she did?
She mentioned his pimp.
She mentioned his pimp.
She's with that pimp Jesus.
Right.
This kid, this kid, he's not, look, they got his, they got his pimp in there.
Right.
It's Pideske.
This is a, this is just the happenstance.
This is just coincidence.
Let's see what, what Peter does.
And we're going to go through these verses right, right quick.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
So he denied it.
And he said, no, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Next one.
And then yeah.
So now he comes out of the courtyard.
And when he does an alley, another Pideske different one.
Recognizes him.
She sees him and she says to the people there, she says, this guy is one of those kids that
belongs to Jesus, one of those of Jesus, one of those of Jesus.
You mean Jesus owns these guys.
Don't you realize that that kid that he was arrested with in the public park at four a
minute.
That kid was a coluthoing him.
He was serving.
He was serving.
Let's go to the next one.
It gets darker, but I want to see Judas get drug.
I really do.
I really do.
Yeah.
So he goes a little bit away and those, those standing off at a distance, a distance, they
come up and they say, Hey, um, you are from these guys.
Um, and we know it because from Jesus, because your Lalia gives you away, bro.
Your Lalia gives you away.
What is your Lalia?
What is your Lalia?
It's the way that you converse.
It's the way that you hold yourself.
Why you converse.
You know, you get to know somebody's Lalia and this kid, Peter, his Lalia is up around
Galilee.
That's where he's coming from.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What does Peter do in response?
Throw it up there.
