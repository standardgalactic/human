What does Peter do?
Peter starts kind of the Matizan.
He starts cursing.
Right.
How do you Lalia?
Like one of those prostitutes around Nazareth.
Um, how do you, how do you, how do you carry yourself?
What is your comportment?
Um, how do you talk?
You do exactly what Peter does.
You start cursing and this is the kind of cursing that's go, um, go to hell type of cursing
or may die, may shark each mama, that kind of thing.
Right.
Um, so they know they're like, yeah, he's, you know, he's one of them.
So that's two prostitutes.
Why do you think that two underage prostitutes recognize Peter, the rock and first pope of
the great and mighty Christian church?
Don't worry.
We know how to drug these kids.
Right.
Jesus knows.
Let's get to them.
Right.
Sure.
This is going to be real climactic here because they, they want to see them.
They want to see them.
And I appreciate you guys being thanks for everyone for coming tonight.
That's been, I just love that.
Um, it's an honor.
You honor me with your time.
So let me make it worth your time and give you some goodies.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
So before the feast, you know, the Passover, you know, um, Jesus knew that his time was
up.
So, um, yeah, he, he finished loving.
He loved them all the way to his end, his boys.
And next one, please.
And what happens?
Um, so there's this banquet made, you know, and you see the next word diabolum and you're
like, devil, what is, what is the devil going to do?
Right.
I'm going to show you a possession.
You know what necromancers do with their drugs?
They cause possession and Jesus Christ does the same with Judas.
Are you ready?
Let's go to the next source.
We're going to sneak up on this one.
You thought Jesus was passive.
Nope.
No, very clever sociopath.
This guy.
Yeah.
So, okay.
So the bank was there and all our kids are there.
Remember, there's, there's their children or, you know, you know, teenagers, right?
Teenagers.
Teenagers.
Okay.
Room 14.
There's a couple who were 10 to 12-ish.
Yeah.
Okay.
One of them sitting on Jesus' lap.
That's the one he loved.
He loved.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Don't do that.
It's the children.
You make it.
You make it so dirty.
You make it so dirty for a grown man to be in a room full of children with one of them
sitting on his lap.
It's not like he's done anything wrong.
Right?
Let's see him do something wrong, Chewie.
Give me, give me, give me that same.
I think it's the same one.
It's the same one.
Oh, beautiful.
Yeah.
What does he do?
He takes off his clothes.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Why do you do this?
Why do you do it, Jesus?
You make it so easy.
People, he's in a room, an upper room.
Remember, they had to, they had to go through some stuff to get this place kind of out of
the way because Jesus knew his time was up.
Right?
He felt the heat, man.
They were going to come and get him.
He knew it.
Right?
He wasn't surprised.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Let's see what he does with, with the boys here.
Okay.
So he's naked and that's from the Bible people.
It's from the Bible.
It's the gospel of John.
He's naked.
He takes off his clothes and what, what does he do?
He picks up a towel and he wraps it around himself.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Let's keep going.
I know people that we've looked at some of this before, but I need to set up the poisoning.
Right?
The drugging that Jesus did.
Yeah.
And so he pours that water into the vase.
I mean, into the basin.
It's like a catch basin.
Yeah.
And then he began to watch, wash the feet of the students.
Right?
If anybody in here.
Who has students ever ended up naked and washing their feet.
They'd be thrown to prison.
Right?
This is, this is the big event that we're making paintings about people.
This is the very last one of these banquets that we're going to have.
Right?
Cause things catch up with Jesus.
There's a reason the crowds yelling.
You know, they're yelling.
Okay.
Let's go to the next one, please.
Yeah.
And here we are.
So it comes to Simon Peter.
He's going to wash his feet.
Right?
