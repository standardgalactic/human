And Peter says, don't wash my feet.
Here's the next one.
Just don't wash my feet.
Jesus answers him back.
And he says, he says, look, the thing that I'm doing, you don't understand it now.
Yeah.
But you'll know later.
And when you do, now this is, that's the end of the verse.
But you know, when he does figure out.
He's going to be able to groom the next generation.
Yeah.
The prostitution continues.
Yeah.
You mean Christianity was a prostitution?
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
And you wondered, you know, I was sitting with the, I was sitting with the watchers the other
day and we were talking about why people didn't get it.
Why people didn't see it.
I said, didn't we tell him that he was always hanging around with prostitutes?
Well, yeah.
Was that whole forgiveness thing?
Right?
Was that all you spout that stuff anytime you want?
She's still going to end up kissing Judas.
Right?
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go back to the text to see what it says.
Right?
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go back to the text to see what it says.
Right?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go back to the text to see what it says.
We're almost to the poisoning people.
Thanks for hanging in there with me for so long.
We're going to have Neil in a little bit, but I got a few more texts to give you.
Yeah.
So he washes his feet.
He washes their feet, all their feet have been washed.
And so he puts back his clothes.
He puts on his clothes again and he, you know, reclines and he says to them, are you ready?
By the way, he was wiping them off with the thing that he put around his flanks.
That thing is not covering his glory.
I am about to show you the glory of Jesus.
Hallelujah.
You mean you have the only attestation of Jesus's manpower?
You write about that.
You write about that.
I have the only photo.
I have the only photo.
I am the only paparazzi who was able to get that one photo, that one photo of Jesus's glory.
And I'm going to show it to you.
Are you ready?
It's text from antiquity.
Don't get so worked up.
It's just a text.
Yes.
Let's go back.
So he says, after he's gone through all of this, washed their feet, made us all very uncomfortable.
Right?
Nobody here has washed the feet naked of a bunch of boys.
Have you?
I don't know.
Do you have a youth thing that does this?
I don't know.
But if you do, you're probably worried about getting caught, which is a good thing.
He's supposed to discourage that.
Right?
Jesus rode that wave.
Gangsta G was not going to let that stop him from taking care of his boys.
Now let's go to the next text.
I love it.
I love it.
What happens here?
Yeah.
So he says, look, I'm not going to be here for long and you're going to come looking for me.
Right?
And like I was saying to those Jews, wait, what?
You know, this is the Bible, people.
John 1333, 1333.
Jesus Christ says, like the other day when I was telling those Jews, you can't follow me
where I'm going.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Two possibilities.
Referring to somebody else's ethnicity to distinguish from your own or from your audience's ethnicity.
Yeah.
Which is more likely probably the kids who aren't Jews.
Yeah.
Otherwise it makes him sound like he's a little stupid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just a little note.
I just want you to see that little bump in the text.
Like, you know, a lot of this kind of stuff can happen through scribal error.
Right?
A lot of that kind of stuff can happen.
So I'm not going to make a big deal about the identity thing.
Let's go.
Look at this.
And so, you know, there was this kid lying back, right?
Right?
One of his students lying back.
Look at that second line.
That's on the lap.
On the lap of Jesus.
And he was the one that Jesus loved.
He was the one that Jesus loved.
He's sitting on Jesus's lap.
And remember, as Jesus is washing, and he's, oh, we're going to see this.
You're going to freak when you see it.
Go ahead.
Next one.
Yep.
And what did he do?
This kid lay back.
He just put his head back where Jesus is at the level of Jesus's breasts.
Right?
It's the level of his breasts.
So again, that's how tall the kid is.
That's leaning on him.
And he says, who is it?
Because Jesus has been saying, one of you boys is going to betray me.
One of my little sheepkins is going to betray me.
Right?
Almost like he's setting it up.
You ever feel like he was maybe setting it up?
There's lots of...
