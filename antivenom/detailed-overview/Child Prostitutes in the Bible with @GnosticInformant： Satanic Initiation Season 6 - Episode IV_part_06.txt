It's brilliant.
Right.
He's going to do it himself.
Go to the next one.
I think we skipped one that we're going to do.
But I think.
Hmm.
Okay.
Go down to the fourth line.
I met a Thesculon Arton.
Right.
And after it now, this is where the diabolical part gives in.
Right.
So immediately, immediately upon giving him that divine bread.
Remember, he says Thesculon.
It's like it's inspired.
The bread of inspiration.
The stuff will knock you down.
Right.
You'd be inspired.
So what does it say he does with it?
It says after he gave him that that was sprinkled.
That was that he had sprinkled in.
What did he sprinkle into it?
He sprinkled in Pothon Olbu.
The desire for ecstasy.
The desire for bliss.
What Jesus put in that bread and gave to that kid, he says, will cause him to have a desire,
a drive, a passion for bliss.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Kind of creepy.
You know, you might expect that from Bill Cosby.
Right.
I'm going to take him to the zone.
I'm going to take him to the, he's giving it to him.
And immediately the kid gets up.
And was that the, no.
Yep.
And.
Oh, and he says, what happens?
He gives him that bread, right?
That, that, that bread of power.
And what happens to him?
He become that bread.
It becomes the messenger, the messenger of this overwhelming greed.
And with this, you know, after administration of this thing with its desire for bliss,
pompos, pompos, diamond, the diamond.
And that's the devil that he's talking about.
And he says, sit on us.
That's the devil.
The devil enters completely into him.
Pompos alitrosunis, a messenger or a carrier, a carrier of sin, a carrier of sin.
Jesus, could you explain that to me one more time?
Yeah.
You give him the drug and the devil enters into them.
Voila.
Possession.
Yeah.
Haven't you been paying attention?
He's been talking to the devil the whole time, right?
He's like, goodbye, man.
Right?
Now he's using it.
And now you know why the religious Jews that are there say, this dude is casting out demons
by the power of Beelzebub.
Yeah.
Right.
That's the devil.
Right?
That's the devil's power.
He's the one who initiates that.
This is his kingdom.
Right?
Jesus knows that.
He's just using the physics and he's using it with his boys.
If you want to enter the kingdom of heaven, you've got to become a boy.
Go to the last example.
I just want to finish up with this and then we'll call, we'll call Gnostic and form it
up and see.
He's got some great stuff.
I'm going to throw the floor to him.
I just underline a couple of things here.
I just want you to see.
This is from Gnostic's Dionysiaca and I just want you to see that it's describing a group
of women who have put upon their breasts these iron bowls and these bowls are used in the
creation of drugs.
They preserve the divine milk of these women who were suited in armor.
They're suited in armor over their breasts and their breasts are called breasts that
bring the mystic initiation.
Isn't that nice?
Do you know what we want?
We don't want that drug from Jesus.
We don't want that bread that's going to make us flip out and do exactly what he's programmed
us to do.
We don't want that.
We don't want that.
We want that milk.
We want that milk.
Would you be surprised if you found out it had the purple?
You may.
You may.
Now, before we bring in Neil, I just want to say to all the fundamentalist religions
in the West, they're in the East now too, in the East and West, to all the fundamentalist
religions, you who are people of the book, particularly, you people of the book.
Your book is the product of a mystery rite that involves the rape of children from Moses
to Jesus.
We're all into the venom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tonight, we want to call in.
We want to call in the Gnostic Informant.
Is the Gnostic Informant here?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm going to shut up for a minute.
If you would just take over and give us what you've got, Neil, I'm giving you the floor.
Thanks for coming tonight.
Thank you.
I wanted to talk about the purple that you mentioned.
Is there a question is, if this is what Jesus was doing, did this tradition continue at
all?
Where do we have evidence of it?
I have a text about Marcus Magis, second century.
This is early.
This is the first.
What was to say, second generations of Christians after the first generation of the first century
Christians?
All right.
I got a screen down there.
I'm sharing.
There it is.
This is about Marcus Magis.
He's the student of Valentinas, and Valentinas claims to be a student of John.
That's the tradition.
That's what all the historians, like Eusebius, and all of them are saying about the line
of how close are they to Jesus?
