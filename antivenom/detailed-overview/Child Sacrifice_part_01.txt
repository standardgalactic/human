I'm bringing you the first Oracle. You mean we got to go to the Oracles to see Yahoo? Yes, Yahoo is only there because of the Oracles. Let me show you. Let me show you, please.
Here's the great, Jerry, blow that thing up. Yeah, okay, this is the Pythia. This is the great Oracle, the Pythian Oracle. And what does she say? She says,
I honor and venerate the first Oracle of the gods, the great protomantic Gaia. After her, Thymus took the Holy seat. She was the second of that mother.
And after her, the third lot fell willingly, willingly to a Titanian named Phoebe.
Okay, pull that down. I want you to realize what you just had was a history of the Bronze Age Oracles. And you'll notice that the first, the very first Oracle is the woman.
They call her Gaia. They also call her Ga and Da. And at Elucis, they worship her as the Da Maitre.
Okay, do you see where we are? Cult wise. I dare you to get a pastor to do that. Come here, Pastor John. Come here, Pastor John. You know what I mean? Come here. Get out.
Get out. Come here. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Are you ready? Was that a mental thing? I don't know. Just metaphysics here are too hard to understand.
What are these? I want you to notice that these are all women. Number one, they're all women. So that when we're looking at the anthropology and the history, once you realize that, these are all women.
Fantastic. Fantastic. And the first is the great mother who is the earth. She is the first one. That image has not been transmitted to your and my cultures.
It hasn't. It's been blocked. Instead, we have Yahoo. And that's why you need to see what Yahoo was up to. Let's see. Okay, so we start with the Oracles.
It'll be apparent why we went there and just, you know, enjoy it. Aren't they beautiful? Nice. Go to the next text.
What are we looking for in the Oracles? We're looking for that first mantic. What does it mean to be mantic? Mantic. You know what mantic is? It comes from the Greek verb minomai.
And what does that mean? It means to be in a state of frenzy. To be in a state of frenzy. You haven't saved yourself until you've lost yourself.
Right? And this mania will lose you. Fantastic. So who do you think it is? The smarties that are giving all the Oracles. Right? It's those women who've been on the drugs.
Yes, they're all on drugs. Oh, you don't believe me? Yahoo gets mad about the drugs. Did you know that? Did you know Yahoo's got a DEA? Yeah, he does.
Watch, I'm going to show it to you. It's marvelous, people. Nobody ever reads these texts anymore. Why is that? I don't know.
Here they are. Flash them up. Bring up the next text. Let's show. What is she? When I say she, I mean all three of those Oracles, all three of those women, what are they?
They're the prophets of God. You mean when I say prophet from what I call the Old Testament, that is a word that comes from the Greek and that that wasn't in what I call the Old Testament until the third century?
BC? Yes, yes. Everybody, don't forget. It's a big deal. Right? It's a big deal. You go to the oldest stuff to see what's going on with the language. Love it.
Oh, translation gets me going. Oh, it's so stinky in a good way. Kind of musky. Let's go back to the mantic. The mantic is the one who's out of her mind.
She's out of her mind, but notice that she's the, she's the protomanthus of the prophet of Dios. Yes, Zeus. Right? She's the prophet of God. That is her position.
Okay. You got a problem with that? You got a problem with the female being the voice of God? If you do, you're under the influence of Yahoo!
And you don't know the mother. Right? You don't worship. That's where we went south, people. You cut off the mother. What's going to happen?
You're going to end up with Jesus Christ arrested in a public park at four a.m. with a naked boy screaming, I am not a child trafficker.
I said that in one breath. That's fantastic. Let's go to the next one. Who? What else is she? What is this woman that we're looking at?
I'm trying to give a portrait of a woman here. She's a mantis. She's a mantis. She's one who can enter that stage.
Yes. And who is she? She is Gaia. Right? She is Gaia. And who else is she? She is Themen. And who is Thymus? Who is Thymus?
She is law. She is the one who stands for justice. She is the one who ensures that decay justice is in your society.
Welcome. This is Thymus. You didn't, you didn't meet her because you haven't been to a leucis. It's okay. It's okay. You know, we were cut off.
Cut off from our potential. Right? Now we're in the, all these pharmaceuticals. You know, huh? Where, where's the brain going?
