Put on the next one. Let's go. Oh, look at this. Yes, yes. This is the sit around and contemplate.
Yeah, let's go to the next one. He's going to cut that off too. What else? What else?
What else? Here's the Angostri moves us. I just wanted people to see that this is indeed connected with women and the oracles.
Right? Good. Good. That's what they're doing. And that's what God hates. Right? Give it to me and blow it up. Chewie.
Look, now I want to take a quick break. Put it into high gear for just two minutes and tell you what do we have here?
We got these poisons that come out of these serpents and we can use those poisons to influence the plants.
And the plants then will yield drugs themselves. What do these drugs do? Give me the next one. What do these drugs do?
This is from the De Ortsy Walewani describing the Medea's medication. Right?
He says, one of these drugs, when you give it to someone in a drink, causes Minte Muntara, causes your mind to go goofy.
Okay. And what else? And it causes you to become rabid. Right? Remember that frenzy I told you about?
Oh, God, they made her into Lissa. They made her into idle form, into an image form. She was Lissa. You know what she does?
She drives you nuts. Dogs too. She drives dogs nuts too. Yeah. Good. Let's go. He didn't say that, did he? I think he did.
Then what happens? Oh, we got snakes, a couple of snakes in there. I may have missed them, but we have a couple of snakes in there that I wanted you to see.
Yeah, it's one of them. Look at this here. Oh, no. It was, yep. No, I'm sorry. That's out of order. My fault. I didn't catch that.
Okay. What are we going to do? Remember that redhead that we caught people? And those of you who went through state tango initiation will already know this redhead.
We got a teenage redhead full of pimples from an ancient document that was telling us, take this teenage redhead with pimples, tie him up, put him on a skewer, and turn him around in front of the fire to keep his body at a high body temperature.
And then it says, when he's sufficiently warmed up, you know, and his veins are all turgid, then you do the phlebotomy. And how do you do it? You do it with transverse cuts across the arms.
Yeah. That's what that text says. Can you believe that? Can you believe that? Yeah. Why are we doing this, people? Because we're milking him, right? We're getting the blood, right?
And the blood is going to be used in the medicine, right? Okay. Keep going. Keep going. Boom. And here we are. Here we are. Wait, we had a redhead there. We were having barbecue. It was fantastic. What's going to happen?
These things says Yahoo, right? You remember, you remember how my voice, right? It comes from the out of the middle of that fire, out of the middle of that fire, right?
Moses. There's a thing going on with Moses here, right? This is the Exodus. What is going on? Yahoo and Moses are having a conversation through a bush. They're doing their serpent magic together.
Yeah. Turn things into serpents. Turn things out using that rod, that robdon. Oh, wait a minute. Those of you who are in my Greek class, you know that the robdon is an instrument used by the Bacchans.
So you were already one step ahead when I told you Moses had a robdon. It didn't surprise you, right? And he's there. He's doing the same thing the Egyptians are doing. It's Isosynosiris, right? And they're using the magic. They're using the venoms.
Yes. And if you hold up, go back to the text. If you hold up that serpent, you know. Remember, this is Yahoo. He speaks through that fire. And you say, wait a minute. Yahoo is using the same avenue that they speak of the pagan gods using that came before Yahoo?
Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. They can all look at each other, right? They can all look at each other. People would say, where's your wife, Yahoo? Right? He's using the same images. This is the writer of this thing, of this Septuagint, these books of Moses that I'm quoting. This is his reaction to his surroundings.
Right? It's lovely. Authors sometimes will, you know, they're like puzzles. You have to figure them out. You have to get in their head and figure out, you know, where is Shakespeare stealing his material from? Oh, it's a zodiac of life.
All right. Rest that guy. By the way, Ireland, you shouldn't have put up with that. Where's the queen? All right. Let's not do that. Let's go to the next one. Yeah. Okay. Let's go to the next one. Oh, God, love these. Love these Bible quotes. Yeah.
Yeah. Oh, okay. Look, look, look, look. So what happens to Moses? You know, he saw an angel, right? An angel appeared to him. It's an angel of Curios. Oh, sorry. It's an angel. It's a Yahoo angel. And where did he appear in Puri in the fire? But he's not just in fire. That's not the cult terminology. Right? If he's in fire, it means he's, you know, somebody put him out. He's in the Puri flogos.
He's in the fire of the flocks. What is the flocks again? That's the stuff that's in Jesus's eyes in the apocalypse. That's the stuff that's in Jesus's eyes. Yeah. Yeah. God, from the fire. Did you know that? Now you know why Yahoo was like, come here, Eve, come here.
Come here, Awa, which is a bucket cry. Come here, Awa. Awa was going to make Adam Adam. She was going to make him invulnerable. Yeah, she was going to put him through the fire. Now, unfortunately, Lucifer got to her first. Yeah. Did you ever notice, by the way, nobody ever notices this? Did you ever notice in the book of Genesis?
Which is a Greek word. In the book of Genesis, the devil gets to Eve. They do the fruit thing. And then she goes and takes it to Adam. Did you ever wonder the wonder? What was it that the devil and Eve did that ended up them being naked?
