No, no, no, no.
I mean, look, I don't know,
I know nothing about this topic, essentially.
So I'm just sort of, when I, Dan,
he was a super nice guy.
I'm really happy that he came down and did the show.
I got along with him great.
I don't have anything negative to say about it.
But when people come in and they say, I mean,
I just literally, I'm taking people's word for stuff
most of the time.
I can kind of have a read for people if they're full of shit or not.
But when it comes to a Bible scholar,
I have no background,
and I have no knowledge of this stuff,
other than what I've learned in the past two months
with you and Neil.
I'm taking what I've learned
and trying to compare it against to what he was saying.
And I leave it up to people like you,
who have the credentials and the academic background
to rip this stuff apart as much as you can.
Yeah, brilliant, brilliant.
Okay, now, do you see,
I just want to ask Satanic congregation,
do you see what's going on?
You see that Renaissance person stepping forward?
There's no, there's no funny thing going on.
Nobody has hypnotized Danny.
Nobody, no, no, he's not part of a cult.
He's not part of religion.
What is he doing though?
He's activating that reasoned core.
That's the classical reasoned core.
And if you can't stand up against it, that's it, right?
You fall.
That's for those of us who worship that reason,
who find that nature to be so compelling.
I love it.
Can I get a couple?
I know you've got to go.
Can I get a couple of comments?
Oh, you don't?
Oh, I thought, okay, we were running up against the 30s,
so I didn't want to keep you.
No, it's okay.
I can go for another 10 minutes if you want.
Oh, fantastic.
Give me one of these then, Chewie.
Give me one of those.
This is, I think this is very,
sums up just what you were just saying.
You know, a commenter says,
what did Hillman make up?
Right? Does anyone read ancient Greek?
Right?
So I can step up here and I can say anything.
And I can sell you anything
because you're not an expert.
Okay?
So in the field of experts,
there are those who walk around and put on a show.
Right?
And the ones who really are disciplined,
who have been in the dojo
and who have made this a part of their being,
those people can tell.
I can tell.
I can tell when I hear Dan's Greek.
I can tell when I hear anything Kip says about Greek.
I can tell that they're completely,
you know, they've had a couple of semesters at most.
Right?
They're at a very low level of performance.
So when he's telling you something
that is completely non-source based,
that's what compels me to say,
hey, we need to really,
we need to really do something about this.
But this comment betrays that.
Go back to that comment, Chewie.
Right? Does anyone read ancient Greek?
No.
And that's the trick.
If I teach you the Greek,
you'll have the tool.
You can break down this stuff yourself.
You can look up all these texts and see what it is.
There's one thing I wanted to ask,
Danny.
Yeah.
You guys talked about the word Christ.
Yes.
I'm going to blue fog again, Chewie.
Oh, there we go.
You guys talked about the word Christing.
And he said, look, this doesn't occur
within the Christian vocabulary.
And this is the perfect example
that I just want to share with you.
Look, here's a text from the Bible.
It's in the Bible.
Do these people actually read their own sources?
Do you know what John Scarborough would have done
if I'd have missed something like that?
He'd have kicked me up and down one side of the hall
and the other.
He wouldn't have let me have pints with him at all.
No, it's the big one here.
