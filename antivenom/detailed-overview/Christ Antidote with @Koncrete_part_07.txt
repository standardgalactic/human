You asked me Danny about Julius Caesar and it came up.
It came up in your interview and I just want to show
you quickly.
This is the passage that talks about this is Plutarch
talking about Julius Caesar when he was 25 years old.
He got captured by Leistai and what they do to him,
they held him for ransom and then he sailed.
When as soon as he got the ransom, he sailed away,
got a Roman fleet, came back, took him captive,
took back all his ransom and crucified him,
every one of them.
But that's what he told him he was going to do when he
was being held captive.
They held him for 38 days and he was, you know,
he was not a happy camper.
Here are the texts.
Look at the second line.
They capture him around the island called Drug Island.
And it says he's captured by Peraton.
Now you see the world.
You say, wait a minute.
Oh man, you told me it was Leistais.
It is.
Just wait.
You told me it was Leistais and it's Peraton.
This is where we get our word pirate.
And at this time that Plutarch is writing this,
they're transitioning from a Leistais to a Peraton.
They're changing the terminology.
Watch.
Watch.
This is gorgeous.
Go to the next one, Chewie.
Boom.
Here it is.
Look at the, look at the Perates.
What is it?
It's a brigand.
It's a pirate.
Look at the last line though, Danny.
It says later.
It's a later word for a Leistais.
And the person, look at the name at the bottom.
Amen.
Yes.
That is the dude.
That is the dude who showed Plutarch exactly what was going on.
Linguistically, he's a mathematician and all this kind of stuff.
Crazy dude.
Right?
Okay.
Now watch what happens though.
You're going to ask, you're going to say, wait a minute.
Peraton.
That's not enough.
Give me the last one.
Look at this, Danny.
Look at the second line.
This is in the same passage of Plutarch.
This is in his biography of Julius Caesar.
And when is he writing?
Right around 100, 110 AD.
Right?
So he is completely contemporary, Danny, which you pointed out in your interview.
He is completely contemporary with the writing of the New Testament.
So his terms are the New Testament terms.
And you'll see in the second line, who are these pirates?
They're Leistas.
They're Leistas.
And this is where it says Julius Caesar gathers them all up.
He gathers them together.
And he, on his tower, will send them.
He crucifies them.
Just like he said he would.
Right?
So.
Yeah.
I think I asked him as well.
I asked him on the podcast.
I also asked Dan on the podcast.
I asked him if the two guys that were crucified on each side of Jesus were Leistas.
And I think he said they were not.
Right?
Yeah.
He said they were.
I don't know.
He pulled out of, he pulled out a lexicon, a New Testament lexicon, which is like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a different lexicon.
Yeah.
Which is like pulling out a landmine.
Imagine if we define the field by all the, if the thieves get to write everything.
Right?
That's basically a New Testament lexicon is.
It's that, it's that idea.
Danny, let me ask this.
Did you feel like you were talking to someone who thought that people in the world of the
New Testament narrative, those people were different from the people around them who,
you know, their neighbors and everything are speaking the same language.
Did you get the feeling like Christianity is different or monist mystery is kind of different
from, you know, those pagans?
What are those pagans doing?
That doesn't apply.
Did you get that feeling?
Not really.
No, I don't think.
And it's, it's, I don't really, I can't, as soon as I walk out of a podcast, I kind of blank on it.
I lose all memory of it, but I haven't watched that one back yet.
