I noticed in your interview
That
You're direct with the sources
I like that a lot
You went back to the
Perseus
The Oxford
Great Lexicon
Yeah, go ahead
He was asking me questions about
Some of the
Controversies surrounding
Your interview and the criticisms you got
He says the big one
That he was getting from people
People were emailing him
Messaging him, leaving comments
Saying that I'm on his wrong
About lace days
So I said, alright, let's test it out
Let's look it up
So we went on the Perseus Tufts
We went to Alice
We asked Alice in Wonderland
What does lace days mean?
Pirate and buccaneer
By the way, we were in Tampa Bay
Home with the buccaneers
We were in Tampa Bay, home with the lace days
So we found
Yeah, I showed Danny
How to use Alice
He was impressed
Fantastic, so it was real
Bacchic stuff
You went to some of the early Christian sources
I don't want to spoil it because people want to see it
But you did some early Christian stuff
And you were talking
Oh God, epiphanious for somebody
And
About all those sex
Neil, you got something about Christian sex
You like all those different
Groups, don't you?
You know they go back to the Nicolations
You know what I mean?
And you know what they were doing
And you were talking about the gospel
The gospel of these
People, right?
And what is
Mary do
To Jesus, please
In YouTube
Friendly and
Educationally
Let's be educational
It's a place of the museum
It's education
Tell me with that kind of
Feel
Tell me what Mary and Jesus are doing
Up on the mountain
We have a list about seven different groups
He lists
The Barbarites, the Zacchaeans
The Socrates
And he says he needs a whole list
Of these groups from all different
Areas from Asia Minor
Syria, Greece, Rome
North Africa
All these different areas and they're all these different names
They're named after their leader
Whoever their leader's name is, they're Zacchaeans or whatever
And he says that they all have in common
A gospel
It's called the Questions of Mary
And
He says in this gospel
Jesus takes Mary up on the mountain
And says and then what he does is
He performs a right
Some sort of magical right where
He produces a woman
Out of the side of his rib
So he becomes a male and female
At the same time and he produces the woman
Then he goes and continues
To have intercourse with this said woman
Produces sperm from this
And then
Hands it over to Mary
And says if you want to make it
Into the kingdom of heaven you must drink
My blood and eat my flesh
This is my sarks that I give to you
Mary goes oh I can't handle it
She falls down on the ground
He picks her up and he says
Don't you have any faith
Woman?
It sounds like something
Jesus would actually say too
That's the crazy part about this gospel
Now here's my question
So you can poo-poo that and say
Oh it's the
Certain group of Christians
Writing about another group of Christians
And poo-pooing what they're doing
And so it's obviously exaggerated
Can you believe though
That so many of these sources
All link up
And show us we know from other sources
The Ophites are drinking semen
Right we know that for a fact
The Ophites are a Christian sect
Right they're the serpents
I love the name man
Imagine what are you
I'm a sibling serpent
That's what the Christians
Were calling themselves
Right oh my god
Ophites and the ones on the outside
Of the Ophites were like oh no
We can't do that
So Mary is consuming
The hyma of Jesus
That's fantastic
Tell me something
Danny really quick
Danny Jones right
Did you enjoy
Wasn't it great I mean I personally
Think he's a fantastic interviewer
And I
I couldn't have had a better
A better time
During an interview a lot of times interviews are
Pain right and
And people are just they're not good at it
I thought Danny was
Magnifico what did you
How did you enjoy your interview
It was easy to talk to because
