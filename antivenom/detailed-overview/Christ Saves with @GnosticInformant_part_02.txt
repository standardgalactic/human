He's
You know you can tell he's
He's genuinely trying to find out
You know he's trying to he's trying to learn
About these sources he's trying to find things out
And it was so easy to
To talk to this guy because
He quite all of his questions were
Well thought out
And it was smooth
The whole three hours flew four hours
Actually flew by like it felt like
One hour it felt like so quick
It was great yeah fantastic
Beautiful
Beautiful okay I'm going to give you a chance
To say one thing and then
I'm going to jump to
Tonight's talk and if you want to
Hang around later dial up
If you need to go about your business go about
Your business but I'll leave you
With a comment what do you want to say
Yeah so we ended up talking
About the
Different
Different things that we find in Christianity
That seem to mimic
A lot of these mystery religions
Of the time period for example
The Hilaria ritual
Of in Rome also
Down in Egypt for Addis
And Osiris
And it's at the same week
That the Adonis is going on over
In Cyprus
And there's also a
Great Dionysia they call or not a rural
Dionysia which is going on
At that week so they had the rural Dionysia
And the city Dionysia in the winter time
The rural Dionysia happened in the spring
So this is spring equinox festival
Sprouting up and they all have
This thing in common where
A god is dead
Morned over
And then rises and in the case
Of the case of the Addis ritual
They bury this tree
A pine tree they bury the pine tree
They mourn for three days
They even have initiation ceremonies
Where the eunuchs are initiated
And becomes priests of Magna Mater
And then
They celebrate the Hilaria
Which is in Latin means rejoicing
And that's the resurrection of Addis
And this happens and it's a three day
Period from the day they bury the tree
To the day they rejoice
Is a three day on the third day
Just as Christ does
By the way Osiris has two women
That go to his tomb at the end of the story
Nephthys and Isis
Just as Jesus has Mary
And Martha
Go to the tomb at the end
So we're talking about all this stuff lining up
Epiphanius is an informant
He's got to give him that title
He's snitching on himself
He starts talking about all these other
Dushares and Aion
Being born of a version
At the winter solstice
Epiphanius was an informant
You got to give him credit where credit's due
That's why it doesn't surprise anybody
When you walk into a second century
Synagogue
And you see that it's got
Aion on the wall
Right? It doesn't surprise
Anybody in a bunch of Greek
No doubt, I loved your
Ia'o comments today
And
What you were doing was
You know, you can't
Undo that
Once somebody has seen
Oh, guess what
The Bible
Well, the Torah
Was written in the third century
B.C.
You know, and before that
There's Jack for any of this
When you go in
And you say, where are the quotes
Give me all the quotes in Hebrew
That they're passing down from the
No, they're not
It doesn't exist
You mean Judaism was created
In the third century
Oh, I love the fact
That you, you know
With the Dead Sea scrolls
One thing I want to make
I want people to understand
Is you never find those
Just Hebrew things sitting around
Because they don't exist
You always find them with the Greek
That they're copying from
You know what I saw
When I was in Nazareth
I was in Nazareth
And I was on a dig
There was a dig there
There were mosaics on the ground
And there was Orpheus
The biggest mosaic of all
There was a Dionysus one
A horned Dionysus one
That was a small one
The biggest one I saw
Was Orpheus with his lyre
And it was huge
And it was a first century
And I say something that might be
Second century
But it's first century AD
Somewhere in that time period
What I found in this place
Is the golden orphic tablets
This is Nazareth
So Jesus grew up
In this city completely
Hellenized
Greek mosaics all over the place
There's a theater there too
Yeah, and about this language
People always ask what language
