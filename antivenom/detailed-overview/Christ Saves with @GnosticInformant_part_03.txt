Jesus is speaking
Any of the Hebrew
It's all the regular variety
I didn't realize
Kid was sent to Egypt
Where'd he probably go in Egypt
Wherever he went
They were speaking Greek
Nobody ever asked
Why doesn't Jesus come back
From where he was raised
Speaking Egyptian
Because they didn't freaking speak
Egyptian in Egypt
They spoke Greek
And who is the they
That I'm talking about
You can sit around and come up
With funny ideas about
What was this and what was that
The fact is through the museum
And Alexandria came
The greatest work from antiquity
Intellectual, the greatest intellectual work
All of the great doctors come through
Alexandrian physicians
Hellenistic physicians
Who were doing for the first time
The first time
They're doing regular autopsies
They're doing regular
Anatomical dissections
Not only that
They're doing vivisections
Vivisections, they get a criminal
You know, take them apart
Look it, I saw a description
Of a dude's peristalsis
That's the motion
Of your intestines
And the doctors have just cut this guy open
And they're looking at it
And they're following the movement
And they're studying digestion
That's all from Alexandria
That's the Egypt that Jesus went to
And when he comes back
And everybody there thinks he's a brainiac
It's because of that education
So what language is Jesus speaking
I dare you to give me one
Friggin' quote
In Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac
Anywhere
No, no, no, all of his quotes are Greek
Surprise, surprise
People don't understand it
Judaism is an invention
It's the Hellenic world
Moses is
Musaeus
And it is an Orphic
Saturnian or satanic
Religion
Sun, moon, stars, dawn
Dawn prayers
Yeah
Orpheus
And we have the Derveni propyrus
Which is the one
The actual physical copy
Not the text dated to
The 6th century BC
The physical fragments 4th century BC
The physical copy of it
Not the dating of the text
The text itself, 6th century BC
But in this text
Orpheus is called theologian
And he's constantly
Revealing
It's the word apocalypse
He's the apocalypse, the revealer
It's an apocalyptic genre
Which is Orphic
By nature
This is what sprouts up in Alexandria
During this time period
During this Hellenistic era
These Alexandrians who are
Greek-speaking Jewish people
Who are, you know, it brought to Alexandria
After Ptolemy wins a war
In Gaza against Demetrius
This is real history, look it up
Anyways, they start
They start talking
Making up stories, they start writing stories about this guy named Moses
Who they say
Their earliest sources we got
From Aristobelus
From Hecateus
From all these different, from his early, early sources
Say that his
This is Mousseus
And he was the
Either in some sources, he's either the father of Orpheus
Or the son of Orpheus, depending on which one's talking about
Either way, they're connecting him to Orpheus
And they're claiming Orpheus is this
Psalmist
The word Psalm
Means played by a harp
Sung by a harp
Apocalypticism
Theology itself
Is an Orphic
Pythagorean
You know, sort of genre
That we get in Alexandria
It becomes Yawism
It's where you get Yaw
Even Microbius, even Microbius is citing
Where does Microbius cite when he talks about Yaw
Orpheus
Yeah, and remember
You said today, you were gonna say it
As I was watching an interview, you mentioned Plutarch
And you were gonna say that
Plutarch says
Judaism is an offshoot
Of Bacchic worship
He says it
In antiquity
You know what that is? That is a
First-hand
Witness
That is an eyewitness
You cannot get better historical
Evidence
Than an eyewitness who's watching what's going on
And reporting it
Plutarch does
Plutarch cites Hecateus of Abdera
Who lived
Four centuries before him
Four, maybe five centuries before him
Yeah, Plutarch is late first, early second
Hecateus is
