What they actually were
Were they UFO
People and aliens
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I know people are disappointed
They wanted me to talk about them as aliens
No
Of course there's a much more
Realistic, scientific and anthropological
Explanation for them
We just look at the text
The text tell us who they
Are
They're a real historical
People
And we get to meet them tonight
That was a little bit of a surprise
Thank you Satanic congregation
For hanging in there
Purple purple purple
Hit us with the next one
Boom
And I wanted you to see
What is that Medusa
The Medusa above
Right there
Look at the
That's the guardian goddess
And many of you are going to see the name
Aphrodite
Right after it you're going to be confused
Because the little bit that you know
Of Greek history you're getting through mythology
That's where it's just being transmitted
And mythology is turned into
Entertainment
Just like the stage is turned into entertainment
You little consuming
Ooh
Don't say that
Everything is profane
But it had
A sacred intent
The theater today movie
Cinema
That's profane
It is entertainment
In antiquity
They're doing it to purify
And they're not doing it for cash
By the way
We're still not monetized
We're still not taking any rewards
For what I'm showing you
Because the devil hates that
Fantastic
You know what
Let them have it
I love the fact that we have an audience
That you know we don't have to watch commercials
Do you want me to advertise some of you
No
I don't want to do that either
Because you know what
I've watched the back alleys
I know what they do in them
When they're trying to get things
It's shameful
Okay, let's not do it
Let's not do it
You're not going to see any
Paid me twenty dollars and you can say what you want
Right?
Oh yeah
It's disgusting
This is the temple of the muse baby
Let's hit it, let's hit that one
What about these goddesses
Is your Medusa?
What Aphrodite is your Medusa
You thought you knew Aphrodite
You do not
You do not know the mother of the Roman people
You do not
Look at her
Who's after Aphrodite?
Nemocene
And who is that?
That means memory in Greek
And everybody knows
Who's the mother of memory?
Danny Jones was asking me
Think of Nemocene
Memory
Do you know who memory is?
She's gorgeous
She's the mother of the muses
Oh
And it doesn't even penetrate
It bounces off your uninitiated head
And it doesn't penetrate
That's why we need the Christos
Tonight is about the Christos
And she or he
And who's in charge
Lava, hit me with the next
Hit me with the next text
Wait, go back to the Medusa
I just want to see
Of memory
And as you follow down, you're going to see
The immortal one, Athena
Athena is there
And who else? Artemis
Artemis is there
They are all
A band of women
Who are
Those queens
From the Bronze Age
Artemis
Do you know what Artemis does?
She hunts
She kills
Her bands of followers will kill you
Yeah
She's known to strike from afar
She became a symbol
Of the huntress
Who takes your life
If you're a woman
Isn't that neat? Who is that force?
The force that takes your life
If you're a woman. She's called Luciferra
She's given that title
Of light bringer
Right, Luciferra
You mean the devil was female
Before he was male? Yep
Do you have a problem with that?
It's what they call in Greek
Defoe
To natured
Love it
Absolutely love it
Alright, let's go
Those were Bronze Age goddesses
We just got into there with the Medusa
