Sunday morning, dark clouds rising Oh, there's no sunshine anywhere
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom To grasp the message in the air
Oh, if I could have one wish And know that it would come true
Had a wish that God would give us strength To know just what to do
Then we could tear down the fences That fences all new
Fences created by such evil men Then we could tear down the fences
That fences all new Maybe we could walk together again
Tonight we're going to mainline with Jesus
Yeah, you heard me, you heard me Tonight on Lady Babylon
We are going to mainline with Jesus
You didn't know he was like that, did you?
I'm going to show you how to get Christed
Then I'm going to introduce you to a vampire
Tonight on Lady Babylon
Here we go, here we go
Okay, tonight, before we push in, I'm going to start with a couple of comments
And I want to start by saying, we're always going to have a good in the bed
I wanted to start by saying, Snappy, thank you so much
For letting me know that I needed to get you the source
People were not believing when I said Medea was the queen of Babylon
They looked at me funny
So, we got the source eventually
And sometimes, oh, Philostratus, yeah, I almost forgot him right there
Anywho says that she's the queen of Babylon
Thank you, Snappy, for pushing on that one
Right, those sources are good
I'm giving your guys and religious studies
I'm giving them a hard time, I'm bashing them around
You, sir, are attached to the sources
And I respect that, I respect that
Tonight, let's go to the good comment to start with
Who sent me something nice?
Just please, can I just feel, I want to feel good about myself
This is Humble Thanker, I like that name
Dr. Amen, is Mary Magdalene to Jesus as Medea is to Jason?
Wow, that's the most spectacular question
And I'm going to answer it linguistically
There is a 16th century cryptologist
Who talks about the Magdalene being a Scythian word
That is the equivalent of the Maga
Not the Magos, but the Maga
This is the one that came before
Did the witch come before the wizard?
Yes, it turns out historically she did
Who else was going to figure out all that stuff?
Right, took a lot of brains
Here we go, here we go
I want to bring you that Maga
That Maga is the Medwa
And that Medwa is in charge
Is in union with the Jesus
So is there a relation between them?
These are all cult titles people
We're going to read these things over and over again
Wow, until we see it, it's all there
Great question, that's what happens when you stay in the cult
Right, it's what happens when you get the queen and the Christ
Isn't that nice? Love it
Who do you think was supplying all the drugs?
It wasn't Jesus
He knows how to make the punch
But he was getting it all from Mary
The Maga
You can call her a prostitute if you want to
But tonight, since we're going to mainline
We're going to mainline with Jesus
And I know some of you are sensitive about using terms like that
We're talking about historical mainlining
We're going to find that place
Where you can take that Christed poison
And get it right into the blood
Fantastic, fantastic
I've got to give you the best stuff
That's why you're here, I know your time is limited
I'm stopping at 30 tonight, I'm going to stop myself
So let's get to the vampire that I'd like to bring you first
Let's wash it, oh we need another con
I forgot the bad, we've had the good, we have to have the bad
Okay, throw up the bad
Okay, this is from Naruto
Another interesting experience
Particularly unpleasant
Particularly unpleasant
Not just unpleasant, it's particularly unpleasant
I expected at least, at very least
Something from Philo, okay take it down
I cannot take this person seriously anymore
I can't, no I'm going to laugh, I'm going to laugh
And it's rude, it's rude to do that
But my children, in the world there are perpetrators with trench coats
And they will take you places and do things to you
Yeah, yeah, that's what they do
It's their nature
If I were at a professional conference
In the middle of a bunch of classical philologists
Who had given the sweat and blood and earned that spot
If I pulled out Philo
Right away, right away
You lose your credibility, right away when you do that
Naruto, you lose your credibility
Because Naruto, there are Bible studies
There are studies of the Torah
There are Bible studies, there are seminaries
There are New Testament departments
And in these departments Naruto
There are no philologists
Philologists are those who have reached a level of expertise
Where they are expected to go to the international gymnasia and wrestle
That's what they're expected to do
You cannot get by on what Bible studies does for you
It is a sinking ship that has been barely floating for the last 1600 years
You see, because there's a problem in the universe
