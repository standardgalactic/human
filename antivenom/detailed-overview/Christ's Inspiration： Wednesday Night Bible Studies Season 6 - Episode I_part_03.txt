he's kind of, he's writing a work on zoology.
Yeah, he's writing a zoological work.
And the good thing is, is his sources,
which there are a ton of,
we don't necessarily have those surviving anywhere else.
Right, do you see people for a second?
Do you see how big it is?
Do you see how big it is?
We're not looking for that scrap.
We're not looking for the scraps.
Look, somebody threw away an old parchment.
It's got a scrap, a scribble.
We're not looking for that.
We're looking for the stuff that was in the libraries.
We're looking for the stuff
that the people are working with, right?
This is Elien.
You're dealing with a major thinker of the day.
And I know that most of you, and you shouldn't.
Most of you don't know who he is.
Yeah, yeah.
So zoologists, just think zoologists here.
Now we're gonna watch.
Are you ready?
We're getting close.
We're talking about two types of drugs.
We're talking about the drugs that you drink.
Those are the pomata, right?
And then we're talking about the drugs that you heal,
that you inhale,
that you apply otherwise.
And this can mean to the eyes,
it's any other application that you are not swallowing.
If you, there are those you swallow
and those you apply otherwise.
Otherwise, and mainlining.
And when I say mainline, what do I mean historically?
Some of you may absolutely understand this.
And some of you may not.
But you are entering that stream.
You are entering that stream.
You're finding that blood and pushing into the blood.
That's mainlining.
Yes.
Oh, God, that's what Jesus is doing.
It's what Jesus is doing.
And you say, oh my God,
you're gonna show me a text in the alien?
Where Jesus, I'm gonna show you the Christ.
You cannot be Christ without injecting it
right into your veins.
What?
Yes, linguistically.
It's gorgeous.
Bring up the text again.
Are you ready?
Let's keep reading it.
Let's keep reading it.
He says, you know, you can drink it
or you can have it applied as the Christ.
And he says, there are incantations
that are effective at kind of mollifying or softening.
Softening what?
Tonion.
Many of you see that line tonion
because you're working on the Greek and you know.
That's the toxin that they use with the arrow poisons.
When you take this thing and you increase center it,
when it enters directly,
oh my God, there is nothing better, right?
You've got to have a mollifying drug, right?
And he's saying the epodes help.
The incantations are part of it.
You ask yourself, take it down for a second.
Why are these people,
why are these people going through incantations?
You see even straight up in antiquity,
straight up doctoring,
where the doctor, somebody will have broken a limb
and the doctor is repairing the limb,
putting the bone back to try to set the bone.
And while they're doing it, they are incanting.
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
Singing a song while they're doing it.
And the song helps them to reset,
yeah, to reduce the break.
Isn't that great?
That's fantastic.
So the incantations are there
and they help when you've been Christed.
I want you to put up that next,
should we put up that next Greek?
Yep.
I just want you to look at this verb,
and khrio, and khrio, right?
Look at notice at the top, annoying.
What kind of parts are you gonna, annoying?
Look at the second line,
of thalamus, the eyes, right?
We ain't talking about boys in a gym.
We are talking about sending someone
into the world of the Christ.
Oh my God, look at it, look at number two.
Take down the Bible studies, Chewie.
Look at number two, okay?
Just Roman numeral number two, look.
Sting or prick, wait a minute.
To incrise something means to prick.
Yes, yes, poison injected by a sting.
Number two, at the very bottom, to stick in
and they give you the word for the thorn.
Boom, you know what you can do?
