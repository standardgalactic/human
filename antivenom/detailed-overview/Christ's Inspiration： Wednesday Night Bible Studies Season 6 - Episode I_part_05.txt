So I'm not gonna throw you any curveballs, guys.
We're still demonetized, we're not demonetized,
we've never been monetized.
We're not trying to get monetized.
I have nothing to sell you.
There's no merch.
I don't want any chats throwing money.
I appreciate the fact that everybody's got a voice.
Nobody has to attach money to it.
Okay, fantastic.
Hit us with the next, bring that up there.
Here's just an example.
Look, Nicander, he's gonna talk about Nicander.
And my God, man, in each of the field,
there's a few famous people that we all recognize, right?
And then he's just got oodles and oodles and oodles of author
after author, after author, after author.
Realize at the time, there is no Hebrew.
It doesn't exist.
It is not a literary language.
It has died.
And most of the people,
most of the people in Palestine and Judea,
they don't care.
They don't care.
They love Greek, just fine, thank you.
Yeah.
It is always a religiously zealous minority.
Historically, that will come along
to turn the situation to their political favor.
It was in the favor of that religious minority
to revive this dead corpse that was classical Hebrew.
And again, remember, for those of you who want to travel,
I'm not talking about modern Hebrew.
Modern Hebrew is flourishing.
It's flourishing, it's blossomed.
Somehow, they brought life to the language in Israel.
Yes, and it's gonna be happy and healthy.
Happy, classical Hebrew, oh my goodness.
It's a mummified corpse.
It's, oh God, it's terrible.
It's, oh.
So that's why I ask people,
the reason that you're not seeing in Hebrew during the time
is it's dead.
Nobody's writing in Hebrew.
You've been using Greek in the synagogues, right?
Nobody's writing in Hebrew.
So where are you gonna go with the,
where are you gonna go with your sources
if you're gonna be saying I'm expecting
to find some kind of Hebrew link
so that the language can be holy,
the Bible can be correct,
and I can go to heaven or whatever.
Yeah, but that is the joke.
The joke's on you.
There are professionals who laugh
at biblical scholarship, so-called.
And the agenda that it toes.
Julian the Apostate was right.
Nobody, who's an atheist,
and by atheist they were talking about
any of the monists who were saying
there are no gods but blank.
Any of those atheists will corrupt the system.
You cannot have them teach.
What happens?
You get Florida.
You get dark ages.
You get banned things,
and you get people saying this can't be taught,
that can't be taught, right?
Yeah, sign of the times.
Let's hit that text again.
I didn't wanna take this long.
I'm sorry, I value your time,
and I want everybody to get goodies out of this.
So I've got a couple of more.
Let me just hit you with a couple more.
Keep going down.
Here, I just wanted you to see,
here's a couple of names, right?
Who are these people?
Right, they're poets, right?
Well, that's nice.
Epipoios, that's an epic poet, right?
Here's a, has anybody heard of Ischion?
No, you haven't, right?
He's a famous epic poet.
Isn't that nice?
That's gorgeous.
Let's go to the next one.
Right, none of these.
So when you tell me you know antiquity,
you should be quiet.
Because look, here's three Dionysiases.
Oh my God.
Did you know these are sources?
No, there's one of them.
One of them's from Byzantium,
one of them's from Corinth,
and the third one is from Middellini.
Middellini, isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
That's on the island of Lesbos.
That's on the island of Lesbos.
My God, man, you want culture?
Go to a girl's school in Lesbos,
where you've got people like Sappho.
We have no problem finding references to Sappho,
quotes of Sappho.
