Unfortunate reality
Deadly as you know
Poison took the touch
Rubba dubba dub
The sea gave up its dead
Overflowing cup
Hades extra love
Thanos and Athena
Dancing with Numbadia
The voice is in the wind
Hear now why you listen
Q-Sip Numbadia
Shouldn't mess with this
My girl is poisonous
Purple rain and kiss
Envira, that's my chick
Drake and fandom drip
Fangrippin' her lip
Catherine of the wheel
Athena, Numbadia
Purple triple beamer
Sticky icky creeper
The muse dance with Mia
Sibyline Numbadia
Havoc's seen the dreamers
My girl is poisonous
Hit you with a kiss
Drake and fandom drip
Fangrippin' her lip
Hit you with a kiss
Drake and fandom drip
Fangrippin' her lip
Clio
We're gonna see her tonight
And I'm gonna take you in
As the ship is warming up now
And as we're just going through
The space time
Boom, right through that wave
We're gonna go
And I'm gonna bring you to the
Apocalypse
I'm gonna bring you to the
Apocalypse
There's a reason that we've been
Initiating Apocalypse
Tonight
I have something for you
Remember
We work
For the devil
And when you work for the devil
You cannot take money
You cannot take money
Yeah, that's the way it is
What I'm going to give you
In 100%
Genuine reality
Are some words that you have been
Ode
These are the words of your
Awakening
So that you
Might not fear
That second death
Fantastic, do you hear my cult
Terminology tonight?
Everybody is getting ready to get
Off a ship
You gotta get your cult
Terminology going, right?
I don't want you shelling up at
The doors tonight
To watch the ceremony
And to be saying things that
People are looking at you like
Has anybody initiated that goofball?
Right, how does she get in here?
Initiate her
Oh, God
Right, let's go
People, when we go in tonight
We gotta be crisp
We gotta be strong
The forces around there
We need that science
And reason to drive us home
Just as sharp as it can be
Just as sharp
No BS tonight
No ideas
No theories
Just ghosts
We're bringing them back from
The dead baby
We're bringing them back from
The dead Howard
Oh, yeah, come on
Let's jump on the almond spaceship
Yes, of course, right?
You can't help it
You can't help it
It's the quantum reality
You can't help
But be carried
Through time and space
When you're doing the necromancy
Let's go
Let's go tonight
Thank you for coming
It's very important to me
To be diligently protective
Of your time
So I want to give you everything
Just pow
Open up the doors
Let's go out, people
It's here
I want to bring you up first, though
What do we do?
The star charts are screwed up tonight
I need to give you the third
I did this on purpose, Chewie
I did it on purpose
I'll have to show you the gift
Just a minute
Everybody off
I'll show you the gift in five minutes
Just gather your stuff
