Yeah, it does mean to educate, to instruct
To a level during an initiation
Yes, yes, Dan
The fact that it's the bottom has nothing to do with it
Right, the idea of the initiation and instruction
We are pulling those out artificially
When you say Christ, you say apply a drug
Drug application, it's what you're saying
It doesn't matter that you can't recognize it, Dan
It's still in the word
Roots have power
And what these great, the classical lexica
That have been edited
You don't say written, you say edited
Those are fantastic
Now, if you go online
And you try to pull down a lexicon of the New Testament
You are going to find the most deranged, laughable jokery
Those definitions are going to be sizzling
With the spice of theology
And they're not going to be good lexica
You don't need the scholar interfering with the evidence
We're just investigators
And when you walk into that crime scene as a theologian
You urinate all over the floor
Do you know what you just did?
You just destroyed all our DNA evidence, you bonehead
Nice job, it's contaminated
The whole scene is contaminated
No court in the country would take this evidence
That is what Judaism Christianity did
To classical history
And it's why Julian the emperor said
Who we call the apostate
It's why Julian the emperor said
You can't allow the monist to do this
To your education
To all of your writings
They are actively burning down libraries
One of the things people don't realize is that monists
Like Christians in their earliest stages
One of the activities that they did on a regular basis
Was burn down libraries
Burn down libraries
Destroy monuments
Destroy statues
Destroy justice
Take her down, we're atheists
We don't follow your gods
We're monists
You have to understand that real pressure is in antiquity
Hit the next one
Let's go to the, this is going to get good
Here's salvation
People don't realize that salvation
Soteria is a health state
It's a state of health
Soteria, hit the next one
Soteria, I want to fly through these
Till we get to our promise
Because I had a gift for everybody tonight
It's coming, it's coming
Don't you hate going on a date
And sitting down for dinner
And you know, there's no gift there
What kind of clown are you?
You know what I mean?
Come on man, get some
You know, some
Eat some lettuce or something
I don't know
Deliverance
What is that deliverance from?
It's a deliverance from disease
It's a deliverance from imbalance
Because that is what is created
When you have symptoms of something
Whether it's mental or physical
Your diseases are all from imbalance
Now, this is the ancient Greek physician talking
The person who's the healer
The great physician
This is that side of the cult mystery
It's very medically oriented
You've got to restore the balance
Blow that up again, Chewie
Let me make sure that we...
A means of safety, a way of returns
Look at number two
Keeping something safe, right?
Fantastic
Give me the next one
So, salvation
We all need salvation, right?
And how are we going to get it?
Well, watch what Peter says
Pay attention, he says
Finish, finish off your telos
The completion of your faith
Because that is the salvation
The soteria of your psyche
All right, now I'm going to introduce you
I'm about to give you the gift
But then I'm going to introduce you to angels
Real angels, are you ready?
Are you ready?
They're going to give us salvation
Like you've never seen it
Give me the next one
Okay, one more for the gift
Yeah, okay, give me the next one
The next one's a gift
This is just...
He's explaining who he is
That's nice
Thank you very much
Here's the gift
Are you ready?
This is what's unique
And this is something that Christians will not understand
About their own texts, right?
This is why if you talk to a modern-day Christian
It doesn't matter if Protestant or Catholic
It doesn't matter if it's evangelical or Methodist
It doesn't matter
You talk to them about this
And they will give you a distortion
That's laughably bad
Because they're working off King James
