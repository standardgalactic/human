Newer in a national version
They're working off Anglo-Saxon crappery
That's the problem
And here's the secret
I'm going to give you a secret about seminarians
Okay, take this down and brainwash
And then we'll bring it back
When I worked in seminary
I picked up certain ways
I picked up the vibes
Of the way that theologians, Bible study scholars
The way that pastors and priests
I picked up a way that they follow
And one of the ways they follow is
They say that they use Greek
But they don't
That's number one
Number two, they rely upon faith
And you say, well, no
Wake up
They rely upon faith when they're exercising
Their reason
When they are reading a text
They use a theological filter
To see the words
And what I did as a seminary instructor
Is to take off those blind folds
To take off those glasses
Those rose-colored, theological-colored glasses
It's not a pretty thing at all
But it taints
So here, we're getting the raw naked text tonight
That's what classes do
It's like an autopsy
We're not there to bond with the corpse
We're there to figure out what happened to it
Right?
If I am a, if I am a monist
The logos
The logos is that text
Do you see?
In antiquity, in the original mystery religions
That preceded Christianity
From which Christianity developed
And used all of their vocabulary
Words like Christ, words like gospel
Words like salvation
In all of those earlier, in all of those earlier forms
Of the mystery
The terms are being set
Right?
When we get a Christ
We know what that Christ is
It's not like people would look at you
When Jesus walked around
He's the Christ
Right?
Here in the opening of the apocalypse
It's the apocalypse of the Christ
It's not like people would scratch your head
And say, what is that?
What is that?
Right?
Everybody knows what that is
The theologian can't see those realities
Because over his vision
And I have known one female theologian
She was quite reasonable
Typically over a theologian man's eyes
Or this pride
This excessive smugness
And here's the secret
That can pop their reality
They really don't work with the evidence
They really don't
And when you bring the evidence to them
It's, you know, embarrassing
It's embarrassing
And I learned this
I learned about this defense
This theology
Never get into an argument
Satanic congregation
Don't get into an argument
They mean nothing
And they will always win
Right?
It's already done
Their mind is already settled
I'm telling you
I have been there
I have had that VR on
That, that monest VR
And I have participated
I have sucked the souls
Of those who were downtrodden
I've given them the hope of Christ
And the redemption of the blood of Christ
I have shown them that
I have caused tears
Do you know what it's like
To suck the tears of somebody
Who suddenly comes to the psychic realization
That if they don't believe this stuff
They're going to hell
Yeah
Oh, you thought the whole love thing?
Nobody comes to Jesus Christ because of love
No
Conversions take place
When people see
That you're going to put them in hell
Yeah
Listen up
Are you going to hell?
Fantastic
You want to bet?
People are like
No, that's not the way
Let's give them the gift
Let's give them the gift
Are you ready?
Should we punch them with a gift?
Everybody say
Satanic congregation
Visitors tonight
Who are coming
And there are 633 of you
And I appreciate everyone
