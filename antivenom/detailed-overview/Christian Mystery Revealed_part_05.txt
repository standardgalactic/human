By the way
That reminds me
Neil wanted me to say
That this is the 666th year
After something important
I think I've forgotten now
It's something to do with apmonious
Didn't it?
Or no, was it play-thon?
I'm not sure
I think it was play-thon
Yeah, talk to Neil
He's into the Renaissance now
That guy is totally, totally drunk
On the Renaissance now
I love it
Talking to him is like
Yeah?
Yeah?
Give me some of that
I love that
What he's on?
I love it
Okay, ready?
Macarius
Here's your gift
Here's your gift for the evening
This is why we came
Set the mood to the date
Macarius
Ho!
Ana guinoscon
Caioi acuontes tus logos
Teis profiteas
Now, I'm going to stop there
Because this says
And I'm bringing this to you
Congregation, are you ready?
Blessed is the one who reads out this prophecy
And blessed are those who hear it
They're going to guard everything in it
Now is the time
Isn't that?
Hear the words
The words of Amun
Isn't that nice?
Now is the kairos
Now is the kairos
Do you know what the kairos is
To the great physician?
It's the point at which the treatment
Will bring the cure
If you don't find the kairos
That's it
You're doomed
Second death is for you
Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy your death
Are you ready?
It's okay
We're here at the cult
And the cult is going to show us
How to go through the death
And come back to life
It's crazy, it's crazy
Can you see it?
You know what Jesus is wearing
At this point in the game?
He's wearing a lady's bra
It's beautiful and golden
Why is he wearing a lady's bra?
Because he's the morning star
Do you have problems with that?
Do you see him?
Jesus, let me give the...
I'm sorry
Where's the shame on me?
Shame on you Amun
For not letting the Christians know
That the first time you see your dude
Come back
He's going to be wearing a lady's bra
Where's he going to be wearing the lady's bra?
On his breasts
That's what the text says
The apocalypse is the revelation
Of Jesus Christ
Wearing a woman's bra
Why?
Because he's the morning star fool
Learn how things are going
Okay, let's go
Trevor, you darn traitor
He's the best character
Who would...
Oh, the other...
Those are idiots
The other ones
I agree
Trevor, it's the way to go
It's the way to go
Go!
Watch what's happening, people
Where is all this coke coming from?
It's coming from somebody's mouth
And their mouth is athana too
Right?
Their stoma is athana
It's got...
Wait, is that the root for Athena?
Yes, it is
It is the root for Athena
And what is that immortal mouth
That deathless mouth?
It is that which breathes the spirit
Apepnelsa
Apepnelsa athana to stomatos
That is the divine mouth
Of she who founded the mysteries
This text that I just showed you
Is Pindar
Now remember, according to
Pastors, preachers, the theologians, the teachers
You cannot take what a Greek does
And apply it to what a Christian does
Why?
Because they live in bubbles
History, according to
Honest teaching
Is a fairy tale
