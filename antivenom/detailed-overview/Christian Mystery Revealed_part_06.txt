Where some people live in bubbles
They keep them insulated from everything around them
And that's how the...
That's how life is
That's too bad if you don't understand that
Faith, faith, faith, faith, faith
Right?
Here's your unfortunate reality
Your unfortunate reality is
That the language can't sustain that
Language is universal
The forces that are acting on language
They don't care that your neighbor is a different religion
They don't care
Yeah, that's why language
Through science overpowers all of your BS
Oh, can you feel it tonight?
People feel that
This is a temple of reason, baby
It's a temple of reason
Those words that I just showed you
That's what comes out of the founder's mouth
Who is the first Christ
She was a woman, they called her Medea
The root is to heal of her very name
To heal and to rule
Oh, my God, isn't it gorgeous?
Oh, hit the...
Oh, yeah, hit the...
That's a beautiful image, Chewie, by the way
Thank you, Chewie
For all your beautiful, beautiful images
Chewie takes a lot of her time
To bring you these gorgeous, gorgeous images
And they all, of course, are packed with the goods
Do you know what this says?
This is the divine logos
The divine word of Medea
Right?
This is that epos
Now, when you take the word logos
And the Christians say, it means word, word, word, word, right?
It means reason, it means accounting
It means a reckoning, right?
And it means word
And you say, wait a minute
Dan said, if I pick one of these later definitions, I'm off
You mean one Greek word
Can mean word and reason and reckoning
All at the same time
Yes, now, for those of you who are growing
Take those three concepts from your Anglo-Saxon brain
Use the force
There we go
Take those concepts
And put them together
Word
Word, you got it?
You understand?
Word
Now, take reason
And combine word and reason
What kind of offspring do you get from word and reason?
Now, take that offspring
And combine that with reckoning
Reckoning as in an accounting of something
Reckon your existence
Logos
Do you know where this stuff is coming from?
When John says in the beginning was the logos
It's coming from this guy, Heraclitus
Yeah, among others
He's one of the people who bats it around
Who develops the context
I mean the content of the word
As it grows
Imagine that
Now, you cannot do this with Hebrew, right?
The level that you have got ancient Hebrew
For those of you, ancient Hebrew with its 8,000 words
Is compared to Greek with 1.5 million now
Estimated by the TLG
Holy mack
You can't get to this level
That you've got reason
You've got accounting
It's just not enough elements, right?
There's not enough balls and sticks to put together
The molecules that you need
Complex molecules
If you only have 8,000 basic units
You can't do anything with that
I'm telling you a third grader has a 3,000
I mean a 3 year old has a 3,000 word capacity
8,000 words is like his big sister
Alright, maybe she's in the fourth, fifth grade maybe
I don't know, I wouldn't put it that way
Have you seen that stuff?
And don't think that it's just an artifact of ancient Hebrew
The Oskar and the Umbria are the same way
Gilgamesh is the same way
Everybody, the epic of Gilgamesh
Brilliant!
Yeah, if you're in kindergarten
Have you read that thing?
It's only so much you can do
Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh
Boy, if you're impressed by Gilgamesh
I've got some stuff that will cause you to be very depressed
Very depressed
The first thing it's gonna do is it's gonna depress the hell out of you
Because you and I are so stupid
So stupid!
Alright, how can I say that with absolute authority?
How can I say that? People say
You're a genius! Bullshit!
Oh, I shouldn't have said that
Now, it's not genius
I know who I am
And I know Nemesis
Yeah, and that gives me a real honorable perspective on the world
I have seen people who are geniuses
I have read Sappho
I've seen the glory of her own music
She made her own meter
Dudes at Oxford are trying to figure it out right now
To reconstruct it
Isn't that gorgeous?
What a genius! That's genius
