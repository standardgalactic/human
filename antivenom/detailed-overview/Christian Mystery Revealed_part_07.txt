Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna cheat a little bit tonight
And I'm gonna give you what the muse has given me
And you're gonna think, oh, that's...
No, it's not...
It's a gift, people
Do you want to be...
Do you want to be blessed?
You'll listen and you'll guard
You'll listen and you'll guard
And who are you doing it for?
The Despoina, everybody in Greek
Despoina Colchon
Yeah, that Queen of Colchis
Queen of Colchis
Whose mouth is immortal
The original Christ
Was a woman
And her name was medicine
Oh, God
Isn't that the most beautiful thing?
Think about reality for a minute, people
Think of what you've been showing with Jesus
And the dude in the heart
Ouch! Thirsty!
Sabachthon!
And boom!
He's dead, resurrected
Think of all of that
And realize that none of that
Would have been possible
Without the woman who figured out the drugs
And how it is that we can kick you
Into a state of death
And bring you back
And you can have a completely different understanding
Of what your existence is
That's why the second death
Has no sting
Because you've been there
You've seen
And if you did it through the mystery
You were able to bring back
That which will enable you
To live anew
If I hadn't done it, Cicero said
If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be the same person
I wouldn't be the same person!
No!
It's gorgeousness and gorgeousity
I love it, I love it
Bring up the next one
That's the last one that we did
Okay, here it comes, people
Are you ready for some Heraclitus?
Here we go
The apocalypse says, John
To the seven churches in Asia
Right, and then there's a greeting
And it's raining peace and grace to you
You know, now we get the phrase then
Apohon kaiho ain kaiho erchomenos
That is formulaic
From the one who is and was and will be
Now you thought, you Christians you thought
Okay, this is ours, right?
This has got to be
Because we're talking about Yahoo
And we're talking about the Old Testament
As you call it
And this is one of his phrases
The one who is and was and will be
Sorry, Heraclitus
Heraclitus
Heraclitus
Close the door
Close the door
Now, people like Dan, the theologians
Who want to take you into the back alley
Into the mental darkness of confusion
They'll tell you, you can't compare Heraclitus
To Jesus Christ
They can't be using the same
Yeah, they can
Yeah, they can
Just like you can use your neighbor's expressions
That's called language, bruh
Go
What is happening here?
He's the one who's coming
What is he doing?
And look at the last line
There are these what?
There are these seven spirits
That are before his throne
Did you know the Holy Spirit was divided into seven?
What is that Holy Spirit doing there?
Look, the editor here
Even was so guilty
About not recognizing the Holy Spirit
That he capitalized
This is Nestle and Allen
That he capitalized
Pnellmaton at the bottom
Just so you would know
We're talking about the spirit
But this one is in seven forms
And I hold seven stars in my hand
Give me the next one
Here's the original people
This is Heraclitus
And what does he say?
He says
You hear the musteria?
An i erosti
Muue un tai
Muue un tai
We bring out a little bit of that daguilla
Yeah, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
You're going to be surprised
He says the mysteries
That we currently understand
These things are practiced
In a way that is unholy
in a way that is unholy drugs sex christ drugs sex christ
unholy what does it say underneath that give me the very next one i'm going to move down
you're going to be surprised who did you think was associated with salvation
who did you think i'll use it in a minute who did you think was associated with salvation
