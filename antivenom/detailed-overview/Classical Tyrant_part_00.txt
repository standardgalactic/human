Ripple Cush in the air

Take it to the river
Bring the Thriller
Goldhorn Dildos Moella
Medea the mother of invention
Crater of the process flowers
Athena sings her songs
Dark death of a bone
High purple strong
Goldhorn
Poisonous arrows the poor of
Royal purple makes a noble shroud
Amidst the cremation of Venus
All my love for you
All my love let zeppelin
Stay away to heaven
Paradise is close
Doing it right
Superman, Blythe, Crystal Castle
Hollywood ghost
Shimmy by the treeline
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did
And I thank you
Welcome back
to Lady Babylon
This is better than Muse
and this episode
is gonna have to be prefaced
This episode, we're gonna have to
introduce this episode
It is so radioactive
It is so radioactive
as soon as the thumbnail hit
I got messages
on messages on messages
Oh my god, the response
was spectacular
It was spectacular
People really want to come
to see the tyrant in hell
and I appreciate that
I appreciate that
Lucian appreciates that
Yes, and ultimately
your brain will appreciate that too
Satanic congregation
what I've got for you tonight
is going to be delicious
Now, you know me
You know me, what I'm all about
This is a temple of the Muse, baby
and you know how it works
We use that power
of Hecate
to protect that Edelon
and who is Hecate?
I've been going on YouTube
Mostly YouTube
That's where I hang
and I'm looking at different
people talking about Hecate
and I'm thanking myself
over time, these people
they've never met
They've never met
You see, the problem
is that wall
I think it's the fourth
It has to come down
Hecate
Who is Hecate?
She's the one who dances
with the dead
She's the one who dances
with the dead
If you didn't understand Hecate
it's because you haven't
danced with the dead
Are you ready to dance
with the dead tonight?
Now, in typical
almond fashion
what I'm going to do
is I'm going to bring up
those ghosts
and I've only got one for you tonight
but listen, here's the preview
Listen
What is happening
is you're about to witness
the magic
of the muse
We're going to reach into the past
and we're going to pull
We're going to pull
that tyrant
right out
right out of hell
and we're going to look him in the face
That's what tonight is
Tonight is the mirror magic
If you don't understand what that is
that is the heart
of Bacchic worship
looking into one's self
looking in the mirror
Why?
Because you don't know who you are
and I've got a lot of messages
from people
who
Oh
Amen
I've followed you
I admire your scholarship
but you have profaned
the blessed and holy
orange
you have
What are we doing here?
What I'm going to bring you
is an ancient source
and that ancient source is a mirror
and we're going to look into that mirror
We're going to look right into the tyrant
We're going to see
who the tyrant is
This is fresh, people
What I bring to you
is from the spring
This is a classical well
Don't tell me to hurry up
Don't tell me to hurry up
I do things my way
And you're going to love this
Oh, God, Satanic congregations
You are going to love it
Let's get to it
Are you ready, Chewie?
Go ahead and hit the number one
People, who am I bringing you?
I'm bringing you Lucian
Lucian has a story
has a story about
people going to hell
and Lucian
tells us about the tyrant
who went to hell
and how he ran
his real pain in the butt
for Hermes, right?
Here's Hermes, right?
He's trying to tell the story
of what's been going on
because he's been delayed
in bringing all the souls for the day
He's the soul bringer
He's the soul bringer
Here's the anthropology
He's the psychopomp
He's the one, how does he do it?
He does it with that wand
with your symbol of medicine
That wand
is the conveyor
of souls, right?
Everybody who's been here
and who's been watching the cold
note that down in your anthropological notebooks, right?
What's going on?
And the tyrant tries to run away
Hermes has to go back and get him
and that's where we enter this story
and we're going to look
at the classical tyrant
and what is so neat about it
The magic here is you're going to find a core
In Greek
you're going to find
the trump
You're going to find the trump
Oh, God, you're going to love this
You're going to love the connection
You're going to be like, how do you do that?
It's not me, it's not me
I'm not the one pulling the levers
That's the power, that's the power
