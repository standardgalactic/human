Are you drawn to that?
Can you feel it?
Okay, let's see what else
Let's see what else is going to happen to our tyrant
And what makes a tyrant a tyrant
Clothes, though, says, yeah, that's going to happen
We did that one
Check this out
I just want you to see
This is who
It's considered the prostitution
Of his daughter
To another person in power
To make up
A dynasty
If you will
We don't have dynasties
In Rome
Now that we kicked the kings out
We don't have dynasties
Oh, don't get me wrong, we have powerful families
We have plenty of that
But those consuls, they don't form dynasties
Our leaders don't form dynasties
Yeah
It's only when you get empire
When the republic is dead
That you get dynasties
Tyranny
And family rule
Go hand in hand
Hand in hand
Okay
Alright
Give me the next one
What else about these tyrants?
Look what tyrant ancient trump says
He says, epe moite, tell me
Right?
Is nobody up there upset?
She says
What are you saying?
Do you think you actually
Had friends?
Don't you know that all of those
People who were bowing to you
And saying, oh god
The stuff you're doing is so great
James Page
Don't you know that?
They were what?
They were doing that out of fear
And hope
To get what you would leave behind
You got no friends
You got friends who are friends
Of power
Yeah
Yeah
They're just waiting for the opportunity
She tags on there
And she says
Don't you understand this?
Don't you know?
Imagine
Donald J Trump
Imagine him
With a friend
Do you think that man has friends?
Do you think that man has friends?
I know a lot of the people
Who want to get pardoned are his friends
Yeah
Are those real friends?
Do you see what the greek mind
Is grabbing onto and preserving
And holding up is the real beauty
The sad thing is
Don
Don never sees it coming
His life
Is an eternal loop
It's an eternal loop of not
Knowing himself
His misery
Is brought by his own greed
Superbus
They called the roman tyrant
They called him superbus
He was arrogant
And he was haughty
When was the last time you voted
In somebody who was humble
Not this guy
I don't know about you people
But this guy has
Every mark of the tyrant
Almost like this document
Was written for him
And it's a perfect reflection
Of you
It's a perfect reflection
Of you
Here's my wifey
What is she going to do
What is she going to do
Let's find out
Yes
She's going to say off with you
To the underworld while her lover
Is with her making love to her
While her lover
Did we find a photograph
Of that? I think we found
Some kind of AI photograph
There it is
What's your wife doing
Behind your back
What's your wife doing
I guarantee one thing
I guarantee one thing
It's not anything with you
What is the
Trade of the tyrant
That his wife can't stand him
Well
I don't know
I don't know her personally
I don't know if she looked in the mirror
With that sour face
It's got to be reflecting
Some kind of displeasure
Discomfort
Definitely
Definitely you see how
The greek world
Determines and judges its surroundings
Dude
That person never smiles
You can't support that
They got
None of that
No power in the world
That stays with you
The reason that you're not afraid
To go to the underworld
The reason you're not afraid to die
Yeah
Yeah, they've been there
They've been there
These two? No
That's not how the tyranny works
The tyranny is all consuming
The tyranny is all consuming
There is no way to pry it
Out of the hands
That person
Without them
Suffering the same fate
Is pentheus the tyrant
Yeah
Same fate awaits
Give me the next one
Oh, there's a couple more here
Oh, doctor fever
Did we put politics to war in religion, baby?
Right, yeah, I can't have one without the other
Give me the next one
So, here we are
Another dude comes up in the process
And who is this dude?
This dude makes shoes
That's all sandals
He's a sandal-making guy
And, you know what he says?
He walks up and he says,
Look, listen to me
Oh, you
Most honored of goddesses
He's talking
He's getting on the boat
And he says
I used to live next to a tyrant
And very close, I got to observe everything
That went on with him
And it seems to me
That he was equal
To a god
Even down to
His purple outfit
That guy was so lucky
