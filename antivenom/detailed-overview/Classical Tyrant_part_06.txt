That's how he seemed to me
Give me the next one, Chewie
But
Almost like the dude was a
Hooperanthropos
Does everybody see that
That middle word?
Hooperanthropos
It's got two accents
Because that little tis after it loses its accent
To it, right? Okay, cool
What is a Hooperanthropos?
You know, anthropos
Is a man
Or person, or being
And Hooper is just, you know, if you
Latinize that, it becomes super
Who is this?
This is literally
Superman
Now
Okay, all right
This is
The image
In the mind of the shoemaker
Of what
The tyrant is
Of what the tyrant is
Do you see him?
He's the Superman
This is the image
That the tyrant
Himself
Is chasing
This is that static in the air
Right?
We all want Henry Cavill
We do
We all want Henry Cavill
You know what I mean? I'll admit it
I don't have a problem with that
I got no problem with Chewie
Right?
With this complete fascination
With the Superman
Right?
He's got everything
He's got everything
Everything that he's got
That is what the tyrant
Is looking for
But the shoemaker knows
And says, that's not really how things are
Right?
When you don't value
Those things
Their loss is meaningless
To you
Their loss is meaningless
You see where the ethic is going
Give me the next one
Watch this
Okay
Look at the second line
And the third word in
It's the truffe
It's the truffe that he really wants
That spectacular
thing
That when you look at it
It's just, oh god
I gotta have that
But you realize it's meaningless
Over time
It's meaningless, it's empty
It's a bobble
You could have had Henry Cavill
Instead, you got a contract
With X, Y, and Z
You'll make some money on it
But will it make you happy?
No, it won't
There's an emptiness there
There's an emptiness there
Even down to his robe
His robe that is
I like how he says this
It's bloodstained
It's bloodstained
With that mollusk from
The Laconian Sea
They're talking about collection
Of the purple there, right?
Why?
Because in antiquity
You can take it down, in antiquity
The marker, oh and there's
Edimonia in that one too
That he's looking for
The marker
Of monetary power
Is not how big your estate is
Or how big your house is
Your villa
Although they do that too
The marker of it is whether you have
Access to purple
There's a reason
It's associated with royal power
Right?
What you see
Donald J
What you see that draw
Of the purple
That draw is the draw
Of tyranny
And it really doesn't matter
Right?
It really doesn't matter that you walk around in purple
Okay, let's see, there's a couple more
What's he gonna do?
What's the tyrant do to people, by the way?
We've got a whole section
Oh, God, by Heracles he says
This is the shoemaker
He says, look, it's so dark down here
Right? It's so dark down here
Mmm, God
I can't even tell
When you're playing, and I can't even tell
Whether somebody's attractive
Or not, look, it's Simiqi
Is she better looking than Frini?
He says, I don't know
Everything's sort of equal
And it's kind of homohoho
It's kind of the same color
Everything is equal
It's the same color
Nobody's beautiful
And nobody's more beautiful
Than anybody else, that's what he says
And look, even me
In my little ratty tat tat
Clothing, it's all torn up
And little ugly stuff
He says, it doesn't matter
It's equal to those
Purpleed robes
Of the kings
It's equal to
The purple robe
That the royalty are wearing
My little
Do you see what happens, people?
There is an ultimate equalizer
Built into justice
And anyone
Who is
Suffering
From that draw
Any
Tyrants, whether they're tyrants
Who are running for office
And trying to overthrow
The current government disband
The FBI, whether it's that type
Or whether it's other people running
In the system
Or it's people outside
It doesn't matter, you don't have to be involved
You don't have to have a stamp
If that tyrannical draw
Is in you
You got the greed
Do you know what you live in?
You live in the kingdom of the devil
And his job is to punish you
Look into the mirror
And look at your God
With his orange, ridiculous skin
I'm glad they don't care about that
In the underworld, because that stuff bothers me
I think it's a sign of his desire
Really, I think it's a sign of his draw
To be that Superman
Right?
And isn't it funny that nature has a
The muse who draws out
The quantum reality
The muse who
