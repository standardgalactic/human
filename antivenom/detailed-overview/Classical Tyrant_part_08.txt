Let's figure it out
Give me the next one
So that I can see your tattoos
And he says
Wait a minute
He says
Knisuke
Wait a minute, I've got tattoos
Where have I got tattoos?
How do I get those tattoos?
He's like, huh?
The judge of the dead
One of the judges
The judge of the dead says
Whenever somebody does
Something, I'm translating
It's really bad
In their lifetime
There's an invisible
Tattoo
That is placed
Upon the soul
The soul bears a tattoo
But it's when you do terrible, shameful
Terrible, shameful things
Bad things, brah
Don't be doing bad things
What happens to this poor guy?
He lets him go
He says
Look, I'm going to tell you something
I once had a lot of tattoos
The underworld judge
Looks at his soul
And he says
You've got a few here
They've been healed over
You've got some kind of drug
And he tells him
Before I was a philosopher
I did some bad things
And I got some soul tattoos
But, you know, when I started
Practicing philosophy
I realized I could rub those out
Clean those out a little bit with the philosophy
He made himself
A better person
With philosophy
And I'm not talking modern day philosophy
Those guys are power hungry
Idiots, right?
Pettiness, petty power
Not even real power, he's petty
Um, yeah
Yeah, let me not
Yeah
And so anyway, he says
Look, you know, I cleaned things up
I cleaned up my act with philosophy
This is the love of wisdom
This is what causes you to question things
Right?
When somebody tells you this is the way the universe is
And you think a little voice in your head says
Shut up, darling
You don't know what you're talking about
Right? It's good to engage that voice
Right?
Because that voice will lead you to investigate
To learn
That's the love of wisdom, baby
We're Athenians
We're the ones who invented democracy for goodness sakes
Now as you think we're going to be chasing that
You can use that love of wisdom
To get rid of those
Soul tattoos
Yeah
So the shoemaker and
Mr. Poppy guy
They both go off happy
Holding hands, they knew what was coming
They've been through the rites
They didn't have marks
But that's not the same thing
What's going to happen to the tyrant
What's going to happen to the tyrant?
Let's see
Let's see
Okay
First of all
The judge is going to bring something up
You realize
That this dude
Has killed
Without justice
Right?
There's no judgment involved
Tyrants
Commit extra
Judicial killing
And they get away with it
Right?
When somebody gets shot
On the sixth
That blood
Is a killing
That blood is a killing
Right?
There has to be some sort of answer
There has to be some sort of fury
That writes that wrong
Or that blood
Spreads and the pollution
Spreads
In order to avoid justice
The tyrant commits
Murder
Whenever a tyrant tells you
We want some kind of
Trial for this person
And this person's trial is not going to be
In a court, it's going to be under different
Circumstances
That's extrajudicial
Extrajudicial
Military
Tribunes
Military
Tribunes
Those are old
And guess what? That's not the law of the land
That's not the law of the land
Yeah
Thank goodness
There are people out there
Who are willing to stand against the tyrant
Who is the sexiest
Woman on the planet right now?
Who is the sexiest woman? Bring her up
Bring up Liz
Bring her up
Liz Cheney
I just want to tell you
Right now you are in the position
You are in the position
Of the savior
Of the republic
Yes
There will be a time coming
Compared to people like
Cicero
You know
You stand against the tyrants
I put Liz in a
Yeah, in a better here
Just so we can spend some time together
Liz Cheney
Right? How brave
You know, I don't care
What her politics are at all
I saw this woman
Stand up in a way
That
Men didn't
I saw a
States woman born
I was like no wonder dude
No wonder they had queen hot chips
Because this is sexy
This power is sexy
Good for you Liz Cheney
Love it
Was that a political statement?
Absolutely not
I don't care what her politics are
As long as she is justly sexy
Oh god
Right? Love it
Let's get the next one
We got a couple more here people
Yeah
What does the tyrant do
When he faces the charges
Of the extrajudicial
Killing and all the list of things
That tyrants do
He says people are lying about me
The tyrant projects the lie
The tyrant
