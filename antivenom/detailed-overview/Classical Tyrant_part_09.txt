Is the master
Creator of falsehood
Right?
Tyranny
Is always
Illegitimate
In order to make itself
Appear legitimate
It must create a lie
You and I
Have watched
That whole lie
Spun out
And lady justice said nope
Your lie is just a lie
It's not legitimate at all
What did we do with our smile
On her face from the supreme court
We gave him immunity
To justice
Immunity to what? To justice
That's what a king is
The king's word is justice
You have given yourselves
A king, your greed
Has stained your souls
With the stench of ruin
And you have given yourself
A king
You lose your democracy
Give me the next one
So, look, he says
This is old
Radamanthus, who's now judging
Right? And really what's it come down to?
It doesn't come down to that
It doesn't come down to what he's wearing
Because in order to look at his soul
He's gonna rip off his purple garments
And he rips them off
And he says, holy
What?
He is covered
He can't even count the number
Of soul tattoos that Trump has
He cannot count them
He says, look, this guy
His soul is black all over the place
It's got big old bruises
Black and blue
Oh, god
This guy's got so many stigmata
I don't know where to start
They even overlap with each other
How can I read this? It overlaps
Because that's what he does
He reads who you are as a person
Through your stigmata
Now you're getting real antiquity
So he says, look, I don't know what to do with this guy
Um, should we just throw him
Into the puriflegethonta?
Or should we feed him
To Gerberoi?
Should we feed him to Cerberus?
Or should we throw him
Into the river of fire?
Right, there he is, he's waiting
Right, you wondered what Cerberus is
I know at least there's one of you out there
Who's total crazy
For Cerberus
Right, now's your chance, right
Who gets, who's gonna, why would you do that anyway?
Why wouldn't you?
Cerberus loves that stuff
He's gonna gulp it down
He's gonna gulp it down
But somebody else comes up
Better punishment, give me the next
Um, see, they're very democratic in hell, right?
Um
Kunisco says
Look, I know it's the custom
Right
For everybody
Who's dead to drink from the river
Lethe, right, it's the custom
Okay
To drink from the river of forgiveness
He says, I know this case
And
Radhamanthus says, you know it buddy
Right, you keep going
You know it
And Kunisco says
Okay, so
Why don't you make this one guy
Not
Drink from the
From the waters of forgiveness
Why don't you make him not drink it
And Radhamanthus says, what?
What?
What are you saying? Give me the next one
This will be our last
He says, what are you saying?
And Kunisco says
Look, look, look, this is ultimately
The most terrible
Punishment, this is the greatest justice
You can give to somebody like this
As you can cause them
To be constantly
Thinking about
The opulence and power
They lost
Yeah, you see where
The justice comes in
The justice comes in
When nature strips that
Tyrant of his greed
When
Justice brings
Him low
For those of you who came
Tonight looking
For Donald Trump going
To hell
I hope
You have seen into the mirror
I hope
You have seen the draw and the magic
Now of
That attraction
With the Trump cult
That
Power
The recreation of that
Tyrant
I hope you understand that a little bit better
From the ancient perspective
Of the people
Who figured out
Democracy
I thank you for coming tonight
And as usual
We're not about politics
We're about dancing
With the dead
Thank you for coming tonight
Hail Satan
We'll do this all the way
To the roads we paved
A ride up a horse from the sunshine
Blue-toned big-time wolfman
Killed side root cutter growin'
Dawn bringers shinin' in the mornin'
They puff a little bit of the chronic
Poisonous dragon venom
Darkness through dreams
Frank it's time to house up on the hill
I make it rain
I spit the hot fire
Heels above its verses
Make sure they got funny ears on the gold horns
Make a purple of the Sabbath
I'm Teddy Face Mr. Black Magic
Singing hallelujah
Deepest creepers, hot purple movya
Root cutter, evergreen tree grower
The antichrist you dream of
Thundered from unhigh
Venus in the sky
Heavy on the drums
Ada weight funk
Bar kick mania
Magdia dance with me
Where the purple flowers grow
Those with eyes to see
A kiss of Athena
Dream of Saturn
You're in this Venus dress
Roots grow from the stars overhead
Orca hymns to the moon
Orca ritual
With a kiss and a whip
Lady Babylon is with you
