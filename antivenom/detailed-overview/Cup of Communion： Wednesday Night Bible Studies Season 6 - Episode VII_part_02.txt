Por furas. Por furas. Purple.
Oh, the first voice to speak to you from the past telling you the future.
That first voice is purple. And they all got excited. They all got excited.
How many times does this story get told?
Yeah. Lovely. Hit us with the next one, Chewie. Boom. Watch this.
Oh, no. That's okay. Blow that up. Yeah. That's where we're meant to go. Nice.
