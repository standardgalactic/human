using that nard with the moon on, you'll understand why there had to be an antidote there.
Oh, God. These lace days. Oh, shoot. It's so much drugs. It's hard to keep track of. I know, guys, but watch, watch this.
We're seeing the fulfillment. This is coming. The communion is coming. The communion is coming.
And when they find it, it's going to rock the world. It's going to rock the world.
I'm going to tell you this here. I'm going to tell you this now. This thing's developed by Medea.
I'm going to show you. She was called Colchis. Yes. Yes. Depends. It all depends on the magic.
Watch what happens. Let's go. Chewie, let's go to another story here. Go for it.
Yep. Yep. There we go. Yeah. The scrolls were discovered in the 18th century. That's nice to know.
When Workman came across the remains of a luxury villa that might have belonged to the family of Julius Caesar's father-in-law.
Yeah, that's fantastic. Get us another one. I just wanted you guys. I'm not making this up, people. You're getting Caesar's library.
And why is that important? The family, the Julian. I should say the Julian library is what you're getting.
And why is that important? Because one of the Julians, a dude named Gaius, went up to the temple of Venus Genetrix.
Now, for those of you who hear that, you don't hear America, right? You don't hear it.
But that's what they did, because you know who that is? That's their founding mother.
Do they have a founding mother? Do you have a problem with the founding mother? Because they're Romans.
They'll drive it from your soul with a spear. Yes. Yes. Pollution. Not accepted. Not accepted.
Who is, what did this Gaius from the Julians, what did he do? What did he do? Oh, he put a portrait of Medea in the temple.
Why would he do such a thing? Why? If you knew the purple, you'd know why.
Oh, you see. Does anybody want to read the drug manuals that are in the hands of the Caesars?
You may be surprised at what you find. Oh, love it. Love it. Next one. Next one, Joey. Let's go to the next one.
Okay, we're going to get out of this. The purple dye was highly sought after an ancient Rome and was made from the glands of sea snails.
Nice. The glands. Nice. So the term could refer to purple color robes, the rank of the people who could for the dye or even the mollusks.
But more important, at the individual words reading anything, it all says, ba, ba, ba, and they go off. All of it appearing to you in a dead scroll.
You have seen, as I told you, you would see. That is the muse. That is the power that you and I will harvest from that city, that city with its seven hills.
We will harvest that power. Are you ready? Let's go. Let's go to the next star system. Boom. There it is, people.
For those of you who don't, for those of you who wish you text, here it is. Can you see that thing?
Look, look at what we've been given. From the darkness we've been given, poor foora. We've been brought the dawn. Right out of the darkness comes the dawn.
The dawn. Who is that dawn bringer? Who is it? Tell me. Who do you think it is? Put it together from the sources we've looked at tonight.
We had to go all the way, take it down. We had to go all the way back to Dracula, all the way back to Dracula to find that source, that soul.
You are squarely in the family of the son. And I want you to see the daughters. I want you to see the daughters and the granddaughters of soul.
I want you to see them tonight. Are you ready? Chewie hit us with another, hit us with another system. Boom.
Yeah, listen to him. He told you. Let's go to the next one. I know it's unnecessary. Sometimes you have to, sometimes you have to bring it.
