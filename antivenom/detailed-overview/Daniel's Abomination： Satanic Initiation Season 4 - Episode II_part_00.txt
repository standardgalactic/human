Drinking whiskey, when that whiskey's burned through my veins
Indian goes crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've got your selling and you got your drinking whiskey
Oh yeah, drinking whiskey, oh yeah
Okay my droogs, tonight you're going to have to pull out that syntha mask
You're going to have to get it on within the throne
And you're going to have to bring out your war cry
Because tonight we are kicking down the gates
We're kicking down the gates of the sanctuary
And we are taking the holy books
And nobody will ever give them back
Okay, we're going to have to get it on tonight
Tonight we're going to have to be serious
We've got our 30 minutes to cut a deal here
We've got to storm that tower and we've got to take those books
Tonight I'm going to take us right up
Right up through Christianity
I'm going right up through every evangelical's sumos
I'm going right through it
I'm going through Orthodox Jewry
I'm going through that early period
I'm going through Hellenistic Grace
Oh, and we're going to go right into that Septuagint
Right into the heart of your misconceptions
And misbelief
This is beautiful
We're going to talk about the Septuagint
The text of Daniel
And somebody took out of Daniel
Somebody harvested part of it
They wouldn't let it into the canon because it talked about the dragon
Yes, the dragon, exactly one of those guardians of the relics
We know them historically
So here we're going to go
We're going to look at Daniel
And I just want to ask for a minute
Because really where we're headed is the abomination
Dilma
The abomination of desolation
Has anybody heard of the abomination of desolation?
Hit it, Chewie
Now the subject of today's study
Has an ominous sounding title
And it is a very serious subject
What is the abomination of desolation?
The abomination of desolation
Abomination of desolation
Abomination of desolation
Abomination of desolation
Abomination of desolation
