We have our best man on it, don't worry.
That's what they're going to be learning, yeah, and they're going to do it through this
closeness.
Okay, let's see what happens.
Then we'll go to Daniel, we're going to go to one of these Unix, we're going to see
what happens to him, yeah, go ahead, hit it, yeah.
Look at verse 21, yeah, and so Daniel's praying, you know, he's praying.
And hey, this, on there, this guy named Gabriel comes in, who he had seen in the vision previously,
and he's flying, he's flying, and what does Gabriel do?
He grabs him, he grabs him right at the time of the Hesperides, right at the time of that
evening sacrifice, yeah, and what does it say in 22, soon eti seh meh, now they typically
translate this as he taught or instructed or something like that, right, he became one
with baby, he became one with me, yeah, and he spoke with me and said, Daniel, nun excel
though, and I have come now, I've come now to bring a soonnesses, yeah, I've come here
to bring a union, to make a union, why is that?
Why is that?
Verse 23, the word, the logos, the expression, the thing you said, the thing you said has
come to me, go back, the thing you said has come to me in your desis, in your yearning,
in your yearning as you prayed, kai ego elthon, and I came to tell you, okay, take it off,
okay, so I get it, he's seen a dude, he saw in a vision before, and the dude hopped ozim,
the dude hopped ozim, and this is the word that is problematic, because hopped o can
be to touch intimately, it can even be to attack with your hands, they have a hands
thing, right, hands, attack with my hands, hopped o, and the parents are like Jesus,
stop hopped oing all our children, and the disciples are like Jesus, they're saying,
don't touch him, don't touch him, and you're saying, Jesus, what did Jesus say, what did
Mr, I'm not a job trafficker, but this is how you make Unix, yeah, what did Jesus say,
oh, don't scandalize me, don't scandalize me, okay, let's go back to the text, so yeah,
he's come in, and what does the angel say to him, he's standing right there, he's standing
right there, oh, he says, horti, aner epithumion esu, I'm gonna try to say it like this, I'm
just gonna try to bring the meaning across, okay, this is angel to hot boy Daniel, angel
to hot boy Daniel, right, try to hear horti aner epithumion esu, because you are a hot,
you are a hot, passionate, desirous kid, wait, what, I've come across you epithumion, that's
what he tells me, he says, I've come across you and you're sitting here epithumion, epithumion,
you know what epithumion is, that's that feeling you get, that's that feeling you get when you see
across a crowded space, you see that person and Eros hits you, Eros puts you into that state
of epithumia, it is considered an antiquity, a drugged state, Eros drugs you, he puts you into
a love stupor, you are charmed, there is nothing you can do, Daniel, this beautiful boy, is sitting
there in this state, an angel Gabriel, you know how Gabriel was pervert before, did you,
angel Gabriel sees him, says I see you in epithumia, now for those of you who think a word of this
or Hebrew, you're wrong, this is pure idiomatic Greek, Greek concepts, epithumia is not Hebrew,
it has nothing to do with Hebrew, it is an old, old, old pre-proto Hebrew concept, epithumia,
why, because there's Mycenaean Greeks were big into the thumos and what is your thumos,
my thumos, they had all those queens and those queens were big on that, chest talk, chest talk,
epithumia, look what burns inside me, it's my epithumia, that's how he gets Daniel, that's
how he finds Daniel, okay, so let's go back to the passage, yeah, just a couple of things here
to point out, yeah, and he says, so you know, take to, take in mind the things that I'm going to tell
you, you know, and look at, there's this thing coming, it's 70 heptamads, yeah, 70 groups of seven,
a lot of people translate this as a week because we're, we like to read things in the text that
aren't literally there, right, yeah, so anyway, this is the 70 weeks that all the evangelicals get
all aroused about, yeah, I want you to look at the very bottom line, Tuchrisai, yeah, there's that
Christing, there's that Christing of the Holy One, yeah, and that Sunnae Seis, right, in Nosei,
that closeness, I don't know if you noticed it, but in that first, in that first set of verses,
