if you go back, you find, it's okay, if you go back, sorry, Tuchri, we're going to bust forward
because we're losing time, if you look at it, you'll find that the king wants the kids to have
gnosis, gnosis, so for those of you understanding the gnosis and tracking the gnosis, that's what
the king wants the children to be able to enter, that's why Jesus is with that kid, teaching him
the mystery, and Pseudo-Clement, yeah, love it, teaching him the mystery, yeah, do you see,
entering the gnosis, entering the gnosis, did you know it was perverted, did you know it was
perverted, it's getting undeniable with all these eunuchs, you know what I mean, it's getting
undeniable, let's go on, let's go on, I'm gonna have to, yep, let's go ahead and do these,
look, I just wanted you to see Hopto, I'm gonna skip through these real quick, you can slow them
down later, if you want to take a look, go on, look at this, this is just that coming together,
that coming together, go ahead, the next one, yeah, yeah, more derivation from the verb Sunniyemi,
right, Sunniyemi, that's that coming together, let's keep going, Sumbino, you can talk about this
joining, excellent, another passage, yes, brilliant, okay, now watch this, verse 27,
yeah, he's going to, what, he's gonna establish some kind of diathake, what is a diathake,
now stop right there, pull it down, people will say covenant, covenant, praise Jesus, covenant
theology, right, no, no, you people have no clue, what is that word in Greek, bring it, bring up the
next one, look at this, what is a diathake, a disposition of property by will or testament,
look at Roman numeral number two, high aporetoi diathake, look at that, look at that, what are
those mystic deposits on which the common wheel depended, oracles given by a diathetes, next
one down is diathetes, what is that, one who arranges or sets an order, and what is the example
here in Herodotus, yeah, Museus' oracles, now prophets, that's why we're talking prophets
in these texts, didn't you see in that paragraph before, it said he was gonna reestablish the
prophecy, yeah, we're in that place, you can't get the prophecy without naked eunuchs, you can't,
you can't, what does eremoho mean, this angel comes in and pushes this kid into the desert,
he pushes him into the wilderness, boom, what does that mean, eremoho, to be stripped naked,
whoo, insolitude, isn't that something, to be stripped naked, to enter that place,
yeah, or everyone and everything's looking at you, eremoho, to enter into that world,
to enter into that world, do you see the language itself is the language of the initiation,
it's gorgeous mystery, didn't Paul tell you, come here Paul, come here, no, it's okay,
put your hands down, I'm not gonna do, I'm not gonna do anything, just chill out, put your hands
down, just tell the people Paul, just tell the people Saint Paul, tell them it's the mystery,
operation, the mystery, you know it, you know what's going on Paul, take your
vibrant man, shut up, go sit down, next to you, so let's hit another couple of texts here,
what we're up to this one, I just want to keep, we've got to get to a certain place, go ahead,
put that one up, yeah, and what is this aporetos, what is this aporetos, what are these hidden,
what are these hidden mysteries, what are these hidden oracles, these things that we should be
doing that Daniel is involved in, look they're things not to be spoken, they're secret,
they're sacred things, ineffable or secret, look at, they give us a, oh my goodness, look at the
Goace, you see that under B, Roman numeral number two, B, Goace, what is a Goace, a Goace is a
magician, sorcerer, Jesus was a Goace, right, what is that, a man of mystery, when it says mystery,
it doesn't mean, you don't know, it means mystery is in the operation, the execution of a mystery
right, right, of a mystery right, there's one more surprise though at the bottom of that one, pull
that, pull up that one again, everybody look down, take off, take 10th initiation, look at five,
ta aporetos equals ta adoya, let me see the folks so I can tell them what adoya are,
adoya was translated, you know the Greeks walked over to the Romans and the Romans,
Greeks pointed and they said adoya and the Romans pointed at the same place,
it said pudinda, pudinda, that's your place of shame, bro, that's your place of shame,
cover up your pudinda, bro, right, those are the hidden parts, those are the hidden parts,
lady parts, man parts, it doesn't matter, parts, parts, right, hermaphrodite parts,
right, it doesn't matter, parts, cover up those parts, yeah, so wait a minute, these oracles that
are unutterable or unutterable because they have something to do with sex, yes, adoya are genitalia,
right, these are the oracular voices that are achieved by the activation of the genitalia,
