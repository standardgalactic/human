Oh, gee, is it Donna's the Divine Fallon? Death by a smooth smooth.
Only here could you have discussions like that. Thank you very much, everybody, for giving what you feel and thank.
And I appreciate all of the comments. Negative, positive, they both fire me up. So thank you very much.
Let's proceed forward with the material for today. Today I want to bring you a little bit of a text that is normally ignored.
But before I do, I want to preface it by saying, by giving a shout out, a shout out to Professor Kirsten D.
Who is working on the execration tablets or texts, the execration texts, curse tablets, that kind of thing.
And different various incendiary accoutrement of magic.
She also discusses the PGM and she said something. She said something that just gave me joyous rapture.
She said, what's most important is that you go back to the original. You really don't understand it, reading it in translation.
You have to go back to the original. So I was so delighted to hear that.
Dr. Kirsten D. Thank you so much for affirming what I too have seen.
There are sources out there. There are sources out there.
And if you will come along with me tonight as the ship is landing and we're getting there into that time, where are we going tonight?
Tonight we're going Bronze Age. We're going Bronze Age.
So be ready for it. It's a little bit rough and tumble. It's gorgeous.
But we're going to get the mystery straight on in.
Chewie, pull us up our first text, please. Tonight I'm very proud to present to you.
And I'm just going to show it to you. Take it down, Chewie. And I'll explain it to you.
Go ahead, take it down.
What this is is a text called the Orphic Argonautica.
And it's typically grouped in with other Orphic works like the hymns.
And so it's a marvelous text replicating for you that experience, that Bronze Age experience.
And I took you tonight. I said, where can I take my congregation?
Where can I take them? I have to take them to the deep things.
