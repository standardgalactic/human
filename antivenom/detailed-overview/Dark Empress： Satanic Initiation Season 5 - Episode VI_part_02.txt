We have to go to the deep things of Satan. It's where we find all of our power. Fantastic.
So let's go there. Let's go there to this Saturnian rush.
And let's see what she says in the text. What kind of text is this?
Well, this is the part of the text that talks about Medea as the guardian of the gate.
Medea is the guardian who stands at the gate. She is the way.
She is the way. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? She is the way.
That's what the text says. Let's go dip into that dirt that Kirsten D was so rapturous for.
Let's dig into that dirt and see what we can find. Bring up that text.
I'm just going to give you a translation of this. Yeah, here we go.
It's for this reason, he says, that right there at the entryway to the gates, there's this guard.
And she's a queen. She's so far. See.
She stirs up the fire. She brings that brilliance of the fire.
She stands there. Who is this? This is the one the Kalkians call Artemis.
They call. They worship her even today. They worship her as she who stands by the gateway.
She is the Cala Dodromon. The what? The Cala Dodromon.
What is it? Take it down to me. What is the Cala Dodromon?
Yeah, this is the one who guards the way with the sharp, shrill, oracular voice.
Okay. Okay. I see that. We're already into the Bacchic cult.
You ready? What else are we going to do here? We're going to see a priestess here.
I want to show you a priestess tonight. It's really about that form.
Bring up that text again. She would be fantastic, right?
So the Kalkians worship her and she is Danae.
She's awful, horrendous, terrifying for a mortal to see and terrifying for a mortal to hear,
except for the person who enters into the initiation.
