But our texts say he's the Kurios
Yeah, okay, let's go
I want to go
Celsus, can you give us a little bit
And please, use that soft C on the front
Celsus, right?
It's not Celsus, you know who pronounces it that way?
People who don't have classical philology, that's who
Okay, don't, it's not
Skethian, for goodness sake
What kind of Skions do you know?
Right, it's Cithian
I know those are minor points
But in this temple to the Muse
In this place, can we please have it cleaned
Of any charlatanism?
Right, you come in here
You get on that mat and you perform
That's what's important
Let's go to Celsus, I'm going to read to you
Just a few passages of Celsus
And bombard you with some imagery
And this is from a very good translation
By R. Joseph Hoffman
This is the standard one
They make you get this one when you're
You know, in line for
Pretending that you have the ability to
Dissertate and make you get this one
Read this, yeah, love it
The Cult of Christ
Tell us Celsus about the Cult of Christ
You see, we're in the same time
And space with Celsus
That's why it's easy to bring him here
I can drag the whole universe
Backward, yeah
We're dealing with these people
Again, we're fighting for civilization
Let's see what happens
The Cult of Christ
Is a secret society
What's the year? Does he smell the year?
Oh, yeah, it's like, I don't know, 175
Yeah, 180, somewhere in that range
They even debate about that, right?
Let's just see what the man says
The Cult of Christ is a secret society
Whose members tattle together in corners
For fear of being brought to trial
And punishment
Okay, well at least I know where I am
At least I know where I am
Persistence is the persistence of a group
Threatened by a common danger
And danger is a more powerful incentive
To fraternal feeling than is any oath
Hmm, interesting
Tell me more
As to their doctrine
It was originally barbarian
And while even barbarians
Are capable of discovering truth
It happens to be the case
That Greeks are best equipped
To judge the merit of what passes for truth
These days
He keeps bringing this up
Their alignment with reason
Their alignment with reason
Who are these Christians?
Just tell me, Celces, what are these Christians doing
In their meetings? Could you please tell me?
