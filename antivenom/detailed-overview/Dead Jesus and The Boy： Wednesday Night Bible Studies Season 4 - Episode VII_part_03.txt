Okay, you're getting a little bit into there
Into their world
So says Celsus
One ought first to follow reason as a guide
Before accepting any belief
Thank you, I told him that
I told him that, I told him that's what the devil wanted
And here you are, Celsus
I agree with you, Celsus, good man
Good man, typical, nice pagan
Love to meet his parents, this is wonderful
One ought first to follow reason as a guide
Before accepting any belief
Since anyone who believes without testing a doctrine
Is certain to be deceived
Come on guys, be scientists
There's no problem, no problem
We have plenty of examples in our own time
Look at who he starts to compare them with
Sibli, the Seussayers, the worshipers of Mithras
Sibasius, wait a minute
You mean all of these mystery cults
That we've been talking about?
You mean there's an ancient person
Who is comparing Christianity?
No, he's not comparing Christianity
He's saying Christianity is one mystery practice
Yeah, so
When you say that the early Christians
Are using magic and Paul is running around
With his, you know, he's like, you bend over
Let me make you stop using your books
Like some kind of sick, you know, school principle
You know what I'm talking about, that kind
That kind
Yeah, Celsus and these guys are noticing these things
Right, they're noticing it
Look, you know, these people should be ashamed
For a lot of the stuff they're doing
Right, a lot of the stuff, yeah
Excellent, I want to, just in case
Look, in case there was anybody sitting here
Who still is in that one section
In the nosebleed section
That we reserved for the true believers
You know, that section has always got to be made available
Right, or we're not going to have any sort of progress
So we've got that section available
For anybody in that section who is still
In the least sympathetic to the fact
That Jesus is arrested in a public park with a naked boy
Okay
I want to give you the words of a dead pagan
Who said everybody knows what they do with the boys
Christians included
Don't you see?
The cult of Jesus is the cult of Antinois
Heracles, here he is, isn't he hot?
Here he is, you know who this is?
This is Antinois
He's a real person, right?
We don't think that you're sitting around
We don't spend any time in myth
We're with real people, baby
We're with Queens, Amazonian Queens and Antinois
Can I get him back for me?
Let me summon Antinois back, look at this
I want you guys to get, I want you to feel it
As you're sitting on that throne, right?
As you're sitting on that throne, look at him
Look at him, just feel Antinois
Antinois, you know who he was?
He was the boy-lover of Hadrian
