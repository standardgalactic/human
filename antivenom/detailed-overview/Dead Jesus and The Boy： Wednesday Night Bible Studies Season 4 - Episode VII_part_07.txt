I like you for who you are
For who you are is this hode
The thing sitting there as it is
What does the kid say?
Kid said, Jesus has gotten up
He's not this thing sitting here
Oh my God, did he just point to the corpse?
Did he just point to the corpse
And say that, no, no, no
He's been woken up
He's new
This is not him
Oh my goodness
That thing is translated traditionally as an adverb
He's not here
He's not here
But why is the boy sitting on the right hand
Of somebody who's not there?
Fantastic
And what is that kid doing?
And why is he dressed up?
Why is he dressed up like an initiate?
This is getting ridiculous
If we were cops
If we were cops, we would say, okay
There's a pattern
You think so?
Hand me those donuts over there
Hand me those donuts
You know what?
As I'm eating my donut
I'm thinking we're seeing a pattern
We're seeing a guy who gets arrested
In the company
He gets impeded
He gets somebody comes in
And he's there with a kid
Whether it's in a dark place late at night
Or whether he travels up
Somebody's rich tomb
And spends a couple of days with their kid
Is anybody seeing a pattern?
He called himself
He said, Jesus Christ said
I am not a child trafficker
I am not a child trafficker
I am Jesus Christ
I am not a child trafficker
Do not scandalize me
I am Jesus Christ
I am not a child trafficker
Do not scandalize me
For touching children
You know, the last person that corpse talked to
Was that kid
I'd like to know
I'd like to know
But before you think this is over
Now I'm bringing in the drugs
Are you ready for this?
Remember, in the tomb
That sacred place
Where that body is
Where those necromancers perform their rite
Yeah
They also burn incense
Yeah
They also burn incense
Okay
Wait a minute
What?
And it's called fumigation, brah
It's called fumigation
