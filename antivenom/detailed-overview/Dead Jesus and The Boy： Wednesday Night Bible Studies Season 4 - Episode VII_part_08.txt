Every death is full of it
You've got to purify the area
You've got to get rid of those demons
You've got to get rid of those demons
Right?
So what happens?
Let's watch what happens in the next
In the next, yeah, yeah, yeah
So they got up early in Sabbath and they went
And Mary saw, right?
He went to her first
Anyway, I want to get when they're running out
Yeah
And so he says to them, you know
Behold Jesus, the Nazarene
You know what I mean?
The one who's crucified, he's up
And this is in him
This form is in him
Look at the place where he's buried
But they said to the students of him
Go out and say to the students in Peter
To bring yourselves, right?
To Galilee
He's going to go before you
He's going to go into Galilee
Wait, what?
Jesus said to him
He's going to go into Galilee
He's going to go before you
He's going to go into Galilee
Wait, what?
Jesus is going into Galilee
Okay
Okay
And then what's the very next sentence?
And they went out and fled in terror
They're tromos
They're shaking
They're shaking
It says they ran away
They ran away and refused to even tell anyone
About what happened, right?
Mary Magdalene, right?
Salome, a couple others
And they're standing there
And they see this kid
And all of a sudden a terror hits them
A terror hits them
I wonder what they were fumigating that place with
Was it something ecstatic?
Was it something that they were using?
And you think, oh no
Watch, I want to catch you
Now I'm going to chain you up
And I'm going to spank you
You say, no, no, they didn't
It wasn't, they weren't using those drugs
No, they couldn't have
We couldn't have gone there
Yes, take a look at what the Greek says
Right?
Says they were tromos
They had a shake
And they were in ecstasy
They were in ecstasy
They were in ecstasy
No, this is Christian
These cannot be those rites of the pagans
No, well guess what?
Mary got high
In Jesus' tomb
She became ecstatic
