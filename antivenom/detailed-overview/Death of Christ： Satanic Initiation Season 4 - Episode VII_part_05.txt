We're going to have to take out, take out more of the pirates, right? We've done this before. We can do it again.
So I want us to start. I want us to start in one place, one place. Remember, these are international dealers and souls, right?
So we have to be careful with these people. It's the first century. Caesar himself got abducted by a group of these people.
Yeah, right. Fantastic. Fantastic. Speaking of mail, I just want, I want to go to this.
Well, we'll look at it in a minute. I've got an anonymous student who sent in a little bit about the pirates that I thought, hey, this is perfect.
Let's start with some Greek though tonight. Where are we?
So this guy gets up, right? Everybody out of the time ship. Let's go. Here we are. This guy gets up, right?
And he runs over and he fills up the sponge. He fills up the sponge. What's he filled up with? Oxos. Oxos.
Now you and I, take it down for a minute. You and I have already learned. We already have this within our investigation.
Somebody's got the files that in the Geoponica, we're told explicitly that the oxos is the common name for the viper venom.
Yeah, antidote. And when I say antidote, I don't mean they just somebody gets bitten and you get whoop, antidote.
Right. Better. No, I'm talking about the anti-pharmacon. What is that? I'm giving you something that wizards get.
So here we go. You witches out there. You real ones. I know you're out there. I get email from anyway.
That's what we have. We have this anti-pharmacon to balance. It's by these visionaries and these prophets, man.
Remember the guys that are sneaking into Jude, right? And they're like sitting in your service and looking at you, right?
Those are the visionaries, baby. Those are the ones that enter the dreams and pull out those visions.
They're those apocalyptic. We're talking. Where are we talking?
John, John, the what? What do we call that guy? John, come here, hairy guy, dressed all up in skins.
Look at this. He's eating the honey. He's got his, he's got his bugs. Yeah.
Yeah. And what else is John can around? John, you have to shut up. Just stand there, John. Just stand there.
Just ladies and gentlemen, this is John the Baptist in case you haven't figured that out.
You didn't get a proper introduction, John. Keep your note. Keep that on. Keep that on.
There's a reason. So, um, John, tell me something. What do you, what do you got underneath here?
You got a bulge there. You got a bulge there. What you got? Well, I know you're one of the Babtai.
I know you're one of the Babtai. Who are the Babtai? Well, okay. Just a second, guys.
Kids, close your eyes, right? I'm going to search John. I'm going to search him. I'm going to search him.
No, I didn't plant that there. Don't drop it. Don't drop it. Does everybody see it?
