We are sitting
In a theater
We're sitting in a theater. That's where our date was tonight. I should have told you that at the beginning
We're sitting in a theater
There is an invisible god here
Who told us
Wherever you're gathered together
I'm right there

And he
Was the savior
Athena
Brought justice
Justice brought democracy
Democracy brought bachas
Into the theater

Um, I want to give you a word
to take home
I want this to permeate your brains
As if you were a special group of people
Tonight on this date
I wanted to end with a gift to show you how special
I consider our time together and the fact that you are as responsive
As you are and I'm going to take your questions in just a minute
But
I want to give you something. This is a name. This was the name
The epithet
Did Athena receive? Nobody's going to know this stuff. You guys are special. I'm giving it to you
It was a name that was given to her by aries
Just as Hera
Gave the same name
to Aphrodite
Are you ready for this? Are you ready for this?
Oh, isn't that nice? What is Kunamuya? Who?
Better question. Who is Kunamuya?
Yeah
She is the dog fly
The bites
She is the impetus
She is that drive
That causes the bed to come into jeopardy
As Aphrodite
She is the goddess who brings that
Phronesis to war
She will outdo you every time
Every time
We had a passage I think we skipped it, but we had a passage earlier
About producing the black foam
We'll come back to it next time. We had a passage about producing it. What do they do?
What do these sisters do?
Who carry the purple?
What do they do? They produce
A spoon an afron
They produce this substance
That is darkened with the purple
Oh, I want to bring you that the only way to get to it is through her
She who is the Kunamuya?
She who is that impulse
If you passively take insurrection it it will overthrow you
There is an impulse and an impetus
That Athena possessed
That kept that justice
And that force
In abeyance
Yeah balanced
Brilliant
Mother of the mother of all arts
