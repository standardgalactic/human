I never meant anything I said Just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' To keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant I never said the letters that I should've said
So it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows
When I say, never was the cost for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Thank you for joining me tonight
I'm very excited
I'm very excited
Tonight, we're gonna open up some goodies
We're gonna look at those toxins
We're gonna look at a group of people using those toxins
And we're gonna look at what it did to them
And what they then did to everyone around them
Tonight on Lady Babylon Bible Study
We will start with the rope in the cave
If you let go of that rope, you will not make it out of the cave
Even for just a second
You hold that rope
We're gonna look at that rope
We're gonna talk about the mechanics of everything
We're gonna talk about the operation of the mystery
And we're gonna talk about that poison source
That power of therapy
And we're gonna dredge up in the process
A Spanish source, Old Spanish
This is gonna be lovely
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
Let's go
As usual, I'm just gonna take 30 minutes of your time
And no more than that
And then we'll head into a panel
With three of us that are ready to go
I grabbed our Brit tonight and shook him up in a can of sand
He is wound up and ready to go
So we'll see Rob and Snappy and Neil at the end here
To digest and commentate
Thank you guys
Welcome back
So tonight I want to start with some text
And I want to put your mind in the mode of the ancient Scythian
Horseback culture
Poison using cannabis totem shaman
Who follow the virgin
Yeah, I want us to put ourselves back in the ship
Kind of set it for that direction
And I'd like to, Chewie, give me our first text, please
I just want to remind everybody of what we're here for
I just want to read this to you for a couple
Let me get situated here
For a couple
Translation myself
So this is Andromachus, a stereoc
Everybody, you knew this is the stuff we're talking about
With Nero has access to this, right?
He's the one who's sending his archmage
Or his archiatrists out to go get the formula, right?
We need it, we need this compound
For the riot, fantastic
And I'm just gonna translate a little bit for you
It's his stereoc, derived from the echidni
Right, a group of priestesses who involved poisons
Echis, specifically viper poisons
Viper poisons, good
Let's keep reading
Hear me, Caesar
Great Nero
And let me tell you about the incredible strength
Of the mini-throned antidote
This is the giver
Of life that can be lived without fear
An unassailable freedom
Yes, let me tell you, Nero, about Hilaria
Hilaria
Hilaria, this is hilarious
We are approaching the Hilaria
If we are Romans, we are approaching the Hilaria
And what are we going to do when we get into the Hilaria?
We're going to honor the great mother
We're going to bring our people's focus upon the dying
And the resurrection
Yes, this is set in stone, long before any of the Bible is sitting there
This is what we're going to do
We're going to celebrate it here
We're going to call this compound drug
Compound drug, the polypharmacon
Polypharmacon, I believe we have the term
It should be right under it
There we go, thanks, Chewie
Look at this, polypharmacos
It gives us Andromachus
Apoid Galen, right?
From Galen
