And we see that it's polythronos, the mini-throned
Right?
And from the candor
So what is something that is polypharmacos?
It's a compound, a substance that is made up of multiple different singularities
The Romans love to write books about drugs
And whether they were samples or compounds
They had a step up on our pharmacy today
And I want to talk about that
I want to talk about the next level of where you take this knowledge
Keep your hand on that cord
That cord through the cave is the pharmacology
It's called worship reason here
It is the pharmacology
So let's see what we can do
Give us back her text
Yeah, so he says, Cesar, let me tell you about it
It's Hilaria, right?
And it's called the calm
It's called the calm
That which brings you joy
Or that which calms
The storm that is calm
You could think of it as a drug man
But what it does, it calms the storm
It's great therapy, fantastic
And it's called good God
Good God
Why?
Because we're talking about possession
We're talking about possession
In the renaissance of the pharmacology
As we push into that frontier again
In an attempt to bring health to people
This ancient methodology will be revivified
Yes, it will
They'll explain it with better math
Yeah, better math
And maybe some computer modeling
But it will resurface
It will resurface that knowledge
That's what the hope of the museum is
That's why we create a museum here
People have been asking me, what are we doing?
Which way are we going to go?
Which direction?
We stay with the museum
We stay with reason
Keep your hand on that cord
We're talking about the pharmacology
Chewie, bring that up again, text
So what is this thing going to do?
This drug that I'm taking
It is going to take you through that dark harbor
And don't worry
It doesn't matter that you have taken the poppy
It doesn't matter that you have taken the hemlock
It doesn't matter that you have taken the
Death bringing drugs
And when I say death bringing
I mean clinically, technically
The jargon of the day
The death bringers, right?
It's a class of drug, death bringers
Like that opium that we just talked about
So what we're seeing is a nice rendition
Of the formulation of the compound sacrament
That was used in Ritu
That induces this state
This post-death state
Fantastic
And it doesn't matter
I'll just run through, zip through quick
It doesn't matter
Yeah, says Andromachus
It doesn't matter that this thing
That you've had, that you've been exposed to
Is the viper or the asp
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
Why would it not matter
And why would you be exposing yourself to these things
So that you can become immune
We've talked about this
And for most of you this is review
Okay, but we've come this far
Now I want to continue
And show you what the significance is
Of that formulation with another ghost
Let's bring up, here we go
Yeah, call the run, there we go
First one, there we go
Up here, yes, okay
So look, we're in the 17th century
