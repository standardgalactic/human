and being furious. She ran across the path. She carried herself over the path, right? With these
frenzied steps. She is in Oystromania. No, bring us the text. Forget my face. We don't need my face.
This companion of hers, this yason. This yason. What does he do? He clings to her.
And, and, and he's, he's pitting her. He's clean to her as a scaredy cat, yet he's pitting her.
He saw this gigantic flame coming from the middle of the clouds.
Get your karaoke on ready. Right. Get your karaoke on ready. I'm showing you the dragon.
Right. The clouds with the fire from in them. Good. Go back. Bring us the text. Oh, bring us.
Yes. I love you guys, flakas. Thank you so much. Um, yeah. And so let me keep reading. Um, et
saiva, we branteis, lukei dinabras, beating the darkness. Right. With savage light. Savage light.
Right. He is the execution of the power of the light bringer.
Nope. We want to stay here.
Quis rubor isti poli. Cod tan lwgubre, bwyd efo'r ffordd sut sedus. Oh, look at that word sedus.
We got the word star. Yeah. Jason says, what is this? What is this redness around the pole?
Right. What is this star? Sedus? What is this star that shines with such morning?
That's what he said. And so the text says the Virgo. See where it says Virgo? Wirgo.
The Virgo. Wait a minute. This is Medea we're talking about. Right. Yes. She is the Virgo. She
is the Minerva. Yes. Um, what does she do? She answers. She returns back to an answer
to her, to her fearful little companion. And she says this ipsus in oculos et luminatorua
draconis a spicis, a spicis, excuse me. And notice, notice that this is using language from a guy
who read the sibling books. This is in a meter. Correct? Okay. So watch what happens.
ipsus in oculos. Behold in. Look, look, a spicis. You're looking at what? You're looking at the eyes
and the lumina torua of the draconis of the dragon. You're looking into that
illuminating terrifying torua, that thing that puts you in sudden shock that's coming from his eyes.
The word dragon, the word dragon comes from the Greek to see, to see. And it's a very common,
very common, um, saying, statement that the blind dragon sees.
Yeah. I'm Tiresias, for example, right? Seeing the Virgin. Tiresias sees the Virgin.
And the cost is his sight in return for which she gives him ionic vision.
Yeah. Gorgeous. Anyway, it says it continues to say the dragon is afraid of only Medea alone.
Okay. So do you feel the cult? We kind of tried to run in there. We tried to run in there with
Hercules. We tried to sneak in that door and see what's going on. This is the precursor to
Judaism and to Christianity. This is the mystery that is driving Judaism and Christianity.
Okay. More questions. We still have a couple of minutes before the hour.
Excuse pronunciation. I'm going to go with Pierrot, I think. Are you interesting going to the
Hercules or Heracles? Just in general, there's a discussion. I'm sitting at my wheelhouse.
No idea. So I'm interested in understanding what that means, to be honest.
Yeah. Yeah. The pillars of Heracles and the labors of Heracles and the opening of the gateway
to Atlantis. I knew it would not be too long until somebody brought up Atlantis. What is it with
Atlantis? All of a sudden, people are looking for the thing. Yeah. What do you think? What do you
think, Rob? Yeah. All these things are going to be due and come up. It's all out there and people
read this stuff and it comes out. I like the method echo in that respect. You'll read something
