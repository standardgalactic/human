This is your prison.
Look at this to Cleopatra.
Look at this people.
I got a recipe for Cleopatra's dies.
Oh, what?
What is she doing?
I just want you to look from the fourth line down, fourth line down, 10, 11, 12.
This is line 12.
I just want you to look at the second word.
Chiesto.
Let her Christ herself toy farmacoy with the drug.
Let her Christ herself.
This is after she shaved her head.
Did you see it in the text there?
No, you didn't, but I'll tell you it's there.
This is how you guys at Harvard, you can pause it.
You can go back and read it and educate yourself.
Fantastic.
All you religious historians here.
Yeah.
Here we go.
Why is Cleopatra doing this?
Cleopatra is in the line of the Medwa.
Right.
She is that priestess of Isis.
She is that incarnation.
She is.
Yeah.
And you'll notice that the verb Rio, which, which is seminarian.
Wait, I'm going to mention seminaries.
Let me get my whip.
Which is seminarian.
No, that's okay.
Just sit there.
When the seminarians come out and all of the ancillary support group for
seminaries, everything that comes out around them, that includes the people
studying the religions.
It includes the founders of Yale using Hebrew.
It does.
It includes them all.
What happens when you believe a lie?
Your timeline fractures and you go the way of the lie.
You take the wrong handed path.
And what happens?
You put the fake history up.
You and I as Satanists are here for one, one reason.
We want the text.
We want the evidence.
We want what it says.
We'll make the decisions from there.
What we want it.
I'm giving you access tonight.
I just gave you access to Cleopatra.
What is she doing?
She's doing the right.
Now let's go look.
Yeah.
Let's run and look at the right and see what it is.
Give me the next little bit that I've got up there.
Oh, before we get there, why don't you see the Trojisco?
These are little pills.
Nobody ever believes me when I tell them.
But the Trojisco.
Do you remember the wheels that Isaiah talks about?
Boom.
You remember the voice of God coming in?
Boom with the wheels.
This is them.
What are they?
Little lozenges.
Little lozenges, boys and girls, full of goody, good, good drugs.
Right, right?
Good drugs like Synthemask.
These are drugs that you put in places.
And the Trojisco is the one that you put in your backside.
Rectal, rectal administration for the scientists the most.
Yes.
Or you can dissolve these things in wine as well,
which they typically do.
But here for Kefalogia, if you want, if you have head pain,
they call it head pain.
If you got head pain antiquity,
you can take it and you can put in a little bit of drugs
that will put you to sleep.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
And you can use that rectally
and end up in a perfect place under the supervision of a priestess.
Fantastic.
Let's keep going.
Find these priestesses next.
Yep.
Next text.
Oh, this is great.
Now, this is from Ezekiel.
Thank you, prophet Ezekiel.
See, you guys thought the theriac was a beast.
I think you call it a beast, one of the watchers told me.
You guys call it the beast of the apocalypse.
Right?
No.
The theriac is a substance.
It's a compound substance that is half of the communion,
if you were.
If these courses that you took online
or through these different sites,
if these professors who are offering this crap
had any truth to what they said,
they would know these things, but they don't.
They don't know these cults.
They don't know what the mystery was doing.
These texts do, though.
Let's bring out the text.
Am I going to mention someone?
No, I'm not.
Okay, let's get out next.
So this is Ezekiel.
This is that stone prophet.
Let's read what he says.
And you take the, blow it up to me,
and you take the scapegoat.
You take the scapegoat of the calcaseus.
Wait, you take the what of the who?
Bring me up.
Bring me up.
I got to know what the what is.
What is the scapegoat?
I've got it for a definition.
Bring it up.
Look at this to people's scale.
Any kind of equipment, a tire or a peril.
It's your equipment.
Leave it on.
It's your equipment.
Are you ready?
Everybody.
This is going to get a little bit tense.
