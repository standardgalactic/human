Are you ready?
Look at number two at the bottom.
It equals aidoion.
If I tell you to bring your aidoion,
I'm telling you to come to an orgy.
That's your equipment that you're going to be using
at our orgyistic right.
You're going to be using that to find your way
to the orgasmos.
Oh, love it.
Love it.
You don't understand it until you've been there
and seen it and it changes you.
And I'm going to read you a description
of how it changes you through the eyes
of somebody who was treating patients
who had been through it.
Fantastic.
That's a write up.
That's like that's right in your face.
This is going to get good.
Okay.
Back one more time.
I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything
in that last one.
Yeah.
And so this is our tool of what?
This is our tool of Calhases.
That's our tool of glory.
Paul uses this.
Paul uses this expression.
It's our tool of glory.
Does it make sense for all you seminarians?
Listen up.
Does it make sense?
This would be roughly at the same time
as Paul would be writing.
Yeah.
Is it stylistically similar
to that first testament, coin A?
Yes, it is.
You seminarians?
You evangelicals?
I know you haven't.
You Catholics?
I know you haven't seen this.
I know you haven't read it.
Don't pretend to know Greek.
You don't.
Let's go.
Let's go back to the source.
So what is this glory?
Right?
So we've got this tool of glory.
He says, you took your tool of glory
made from gold and silver,
the gold and silver which I gave you.
Remember, this is an argument.
Leave it.
This is an argument between God,
between God.
What is this scene?
God is arguing.
He's arguing with a woman
whom he treats as his lover.
Yeah.
And what has his lover done?
Oh, goodness.
Goodness.
You didn't know it, but Jehovah got cuckolded.
Yeah.
Jehovah, Jehovah Yahweh
is a cuckold God.
Let's see.
Can we see it?
Yeah.
You took your instincts complaining.
You took your glory
and you gilded yourself a dildo
out of silver and gold.
The gold and silver that I gave you,
you made an arsenicos eikonas.
You made a man image.
You made a phallus.
You made a phallus.
And what did you do with this phallus?
You expornated on it.
Look at that second line.
Last line.
You expornated.
What does pornelo mean?
It means to have intercourse
or to engage in religious worship.
You mean their word for engaging
and what you and I and people
who are part of the sisterhood of frustration
whose faces will crack
at the slightest bit of sexual emotion.
Yes.
Do you know what?
Do you know what they were doing?
They were worshiping.
But their word for worship
is the word for intercourse.
Their word for worship is the word for intercourse.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
So they expornated.
They expornated.
They thoroughly entered the job, right?
They got the job done completely.
That X is intensifying.
Go back to the text, please, Joey.
The one we just tacked.
Good, good, good.
And what did they do?
They expornated in our ties.
Yeah.
In our ties.
Yeah.
Oh my goodness.
They're using these devices.
You know, at the worship of the Bona Dea in Rome,
you get thousands of women together.
Just women who use dildos.
On themselves and on each other.
Don't be surprised.
It's a novel concept for us.
But for them, it was a part of your education
and the expression of your sexual health.
Yeah.
That sexual health is a cosmic health.
It is wrapped up in the cosmos.
If you don't want people to be running out
and killing other people for the sake of not having
any sort of intimacy in their life,
