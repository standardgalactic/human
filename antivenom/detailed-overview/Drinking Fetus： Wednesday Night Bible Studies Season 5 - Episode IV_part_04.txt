I appreciate everybody's attention.
I'm going to make it in time tonight.
Yeah.
And what happened when all of this was taking place?
There's a great evil that was behind it.
And what is that evil?
You built.
What did you do?
You built places for, go ahead and bring that.
You built places for prostitution.
He says you built them in the roads.
And ahead of every road is a place of prostitution.
Is the temple of Aphrodite.
You built your society around this.
You built it.
Okay.
Interesting.
Interesting that Jehovah is so pissed about society building.
Wow.
That's something.
Perhaps we should all live in a tribe somewhere.
Right?
Jehovah's got terrible advice.
For those of you who haven't finished the Bible, Jehovah's advice is always terrible.
And he's the very first liar.
So, oh my God.
Let's bring up that same text again.
I'm going to finish it off.
I just want to make sure at the bottom.
Look at verse 26.
And you ex-pornated with the sons of Egypt.
Uh-oh.
See why God is really mad?
It's because she was ex-pornating.
His lover was ex-pornating with Egyptians.
And what are these Egyptian men doing?
They are megalosarcos.
Wow.
You mean the entire...
Megalosarcos.
You mean all of this is about the size.
Megalosarcos means big meat.
Big meat.
Literally.
Big meat.
Here's the meat as the flesh.
As the flesh.
I'm going to cut you to the flesh.
We have the ancient Greek saying, bring it up one more time.
I'm going to cut you to flesh.
I want you to look, look, look.
Oh my God.
It's that fleshy desire.
Your sexual desire is in that organ.
When you think of that organ,
that organ contains that desire,
that overwhelming drive.
That's what it contains.
You went after big meat.
Literally.
Big meat.
Yeah.
Shame on you, I guess.
I mean, good for her.
That's the problem.
When your vocabulary is only 8,000 words long, right?
Yeah.
You know, it's like, uh, it's not big enough.
You know what I mean?
It's just not big enough.
The devil will tell you the truth.
The devil will tell you the truth.
You see what, you see how big it is?
Yeah.
These are the Megalo.
These are the ones with the big ones.
All right.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Let's go to the next passage.
We're getting to the abortion for those of you who are waiting,
who have come here sickly looking for the abortion.
Yeah.
Don't ever make an agreement with your neighbors.
He says, don't.
Anybody around you don't make it because you're going to end up
exporting with their gods.
And what's going to happen?
They're going to invite you and you're going to end up going and
you're going to end up.
What does that last line say?
You're going to end up eating.
Look at the second to last word.
Greek students.
Heimaton.
Heimaton.
Oh my God.
You're going to end up eating blood.
You're waiting for the virgin.
Right?
You're waiting for her.
How do we get to the abortion?
How do we get to the virgin's abortion?
We get there through the blood.
That blood of that virgin savior.
That has the power to open your eyes.
That is what we call the aqua-wita, the water of life.
Okay.
Or do you hear the cult?
Right?
It's through that.
What are they doing?
What are they doing with that virgin?
They're administering to herd drugs that are verifiable abortifations.
A lot of these work by contracting the muscles in the uterus.
Forcefully expelling the fetus.
Now, of course, the fetus in ritual with the virgin doesn't exist yet.
We partake of that life essence through the process of drinking her blood in Ritu.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
Let's keep going.
Boom.
With the next one, fantastic.
Pull that down.
I want you to notice I just translated that as blood and if you will look at the last
line of all of these translations, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
There's no word for sacrifice there.
The new living translation and you will go with them.
Wait.
Sacrificial meals.
You're going to eat sacrificial meals together.
Interesting.
Well, that certainly civilizes it.
Okay.
What about the third one?
You eat the sacrifice.
Now, why are they all saying sacrifice because children?
