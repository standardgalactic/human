Calamus and kinamomon.
Calamus and cinnamon.
Wait a minute.
This is the same group of drugs that was mentioned before in the temple that everybody and their brother now thinks is cannabis.
I would love for it to be so.
Unfortunately, it's not the case.
And here is proof that it's not the case.
These are aromatics, people.
This is what you smell coming from her.
This is the garden that has the wind blown upon it, right?
My garden.
What is that?
Okay, let's go back to the, what is my fruit?
What is my fruit?
Let's read more of that passage.
Yeah, here we go.
Here we go.
And what happens?
You're a fountain.
You're a fountain.
Yeah, a garden fountain.
You're a frear.
You're a well.
You know, a frear is a man-made well.
Something you made.
It's not a natural deposit, right?
You're a well of the water of life flowing out of Lebanon.
Oh, isn't that a nice way?
And what does he say in verse 16?
Blow.
Blow, Boreus.
Wait a minute.
Look at line 16.
There is a Greek God in line 16.
Jehovah just acknowledged, because this is the sacred word of truth.
Jehovah just acknowledged that Boreus and his brother notice are actual gods.
You just gave them place, right?
Of course they are, because they were at the time.
What does the lover ask?
What does the lover ask?
Let's go back.
Blow.
Blow, Boreus.
Blow, notice.
Blow upon my capon.
Wait.
Blow upon you.
What?
Go back to the capon.
Go back to the capon.
Yeah, right there.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
What is the capon?
Well, let's see.
It's a garden.
It's an orchard.
Or plantation.
I see you.
A garden or a plantation.
Look at it.
What is that number three?
Robin numeral number three.
What does that say?
Pudinda muliebria.
Oh, I see.
A garden.
A garden is the vagina.
Is the labia.
Is the pudinda.
The external genitalia.
Right?
This is the paradise.
And what is asked is that those winds would blow upon paradise.
So that paradise would produce that odor, that fragrance of life, that power, that power
of Aphrodite.
That is the power of the mystery.
For those of you who claim to follow a mystery, that is the power of Aphrodite.
That is the power of Aphrodite.
That is the power of Aphrodite.
That is the power of Aphrodite.
That is the mystery.
For those of you who claim to follow a mystery.
And I know you watch evangelicals.
I know you do.
I'll speak to the Catholics too.
To those of you who claim inheritance of a mystery, you have no idea.
You have no idea what the source and power of your mystery truly are.
Fantastic.
Let's go.
Let's go to the next text.
This is wonderful.
I just wanted you to see, because I know some of you are, some of you are not going to,
you're going to, you want to see the abortion, right?
You know, I brought you an abortion passage.
I just want you to look at the top two words that we've got.
Imbru ul kai, kia, excuse me, kai imbru otto miai on the, on the cutting out of the embryo
and on the hooking out.
One of these, these are both ways to remove, go ahead and take it down.
These are both ways to perform abortions.
This is not the type of abortion that we are performing in Ritu in antiquity.
This is the type of abortion that we are performing at the request of women who need this surgery.
And they would use embryotomes.
What's an embryotome?
It's an instrument for cutting out of fetus.
We don't have to worry about that.
We don't have to worry about that on the cult side because our abortions on the cult side,
they're at an early stage of development.
Yeah.
And it's, they're chemical abortions.
The chemicals do for us what the instruments do for the midwives and doctors, right?
The chemicals do that for us.
And we're consuming that anyway.
So thank, yeah, interesting.
Let's go to the next one.
Next one.
I just want to give you a glimpse of that abortion, abortion.
Yeah, fantastic.
So here's a text.
I'm going to flash it up here and then I want you to take it down.
It'll be our final text for tonight.
I want you to see that the title there is Perry Toxicoo.
Perry Toxicoo.
Yes.
And what is that?
Go ahead and take it down.
This is on the drug called toxicon.
This is from a Byzantine physician, which I know none of you have ever read.
I'm talking to the so-called scholars now.
Devil hates you, by the way.
Yeah, he told me this is your punishment.
I was like, are you sure this is the punishment of the scholars?
He's like, dude, it's my prison.
All right.
Who do you think he hates most?
He hates the purveyors.
He hates the sellers most.
