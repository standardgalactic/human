Fundamentalism is an absolute opposition, in my opinion
To being able to freely think
Fundamentalism, notice he said fundamentalism
Not one type of fundamentalism
But fundamentalism in general
Is an enemy of the old thought box
Yeah, hence the old argument
Why are you worshiping nature?
You don't need that nature stuff
We've got creed
Yeah, that's what Mr. Lambert in all of his
He's having all of his guests on
He's got experts, he's got access to them
And you can see he's growing
You see the same thing in Gnostic Informant
They're outgrowing their tutors
Yeah, they're outgrowing their tutors
They're essentially getting an education
And they're outgrowing their tutors and they're seeing
This is a war, this is a war
Yeah, beautiful, let's roll that second clip
Because Christians don't do that
When they're doing the claims for other deities
They don't believe those things are all true
But theirs they do
Muslims are doing the same thing with their particular worldview
They have their own spin
Not interested
So help us with this battle, this war
By liking the videos of the content creators you like
By sharing the content out there as far and as wide as you can
Leaving a comment goes a very far distance
In helping the algorithm pay attention
Even if it is just a comment
Here's one for the algorithm
Because we have such large Christian apologetic channels
That get all this attention
There's really an ideological war going on
To speed up the process
And make this material more broad and more public
That's how you can help
There is an ideological war going on
He's talking about YouTube
Yeah, yeah
This is a man who has worked the front line
And seized the front line for what it is
Yeah, do you see the energy in him?
The zeal?
This smacks of the ancient museum
I can smell it
I can smell the ancient museum
No matter what you fundamentalists do
No matter what you indoctrinated
Dogmatic, orthodoxic, hegemonic, theocratic people do
The museum will persist
You can burn all of our scrolls
You can take all the books out of circulation
You will not stop, reason
You won't stop us
