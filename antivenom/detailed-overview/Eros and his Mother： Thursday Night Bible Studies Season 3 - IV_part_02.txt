This is beautiful
Kudos to Derek Lambert, Miss Vision
Yeah, he's right there with war
This is Field of Mars
Oh, love it
Love it, love it, love it
Let's go tonight to our first little bit of jaunt
Back into the history
We're going to be doing Bible study tonight
I'm going to take you to the proto-Evangelian
The infancy gospel of James
We're going to look at a section that makes no sense
In the English
That's because the translation is terrible
But first, we're going to start with some plenty
And you'll notice I'm giving you all of plenty in English
Yeah, yeah, think about that
There's a good reason
The Latin comes across much more clearly
You can refine it with technical adjustments
But as my students who are learning both languages now
As they're going to see
As they're going to start to develop
Different forms of communication
There's different levels of thinking
And with the ancient Greeks
Sometimes we can get so lost
In the Orphic analog
That we lose sight of what's going on
That's right, tonight's text is full
It's full of Orphic radiation
You're going to love it
First, we've got to go through a little background with plenty
Hit that first plenty
Yeah
I should have been inclined to think that Orpheus
Had been the first to introduce into a country snow in Arizona
Certain magical superstitions based upon the practice of medicine
Right off the bat
Right off the bat, we have an association with medicine and magic
Plenty just hits this over and over and over and over again
You have to realize you cannot separate the drugs and the magic
You can't
When he says medicine
Those things that are given
Medeo to put you in a state of wellness
Yes, he's talking about drugs
He's talking about pharmacy
Sorcery, it's why we call it
You know, all the pharmacone roots we translate
Sorcery, sorcery
Right
Drugs and magic are one
Let's go to the next quote
For the art of magic is a fact beyond all doubt
Though at the same time, I would remark that in the most ancient times
And when Plenty says ancient times, he's talking about bronze age
He's talking about his antiquity
And indeed, by the way, his first century
