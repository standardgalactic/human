And indeed, almost invariably, it was in this branch of science that was sought
The highest point of celebrity and of literary renown
At all events, Pythagoras we find
Empedocles, Democritus and Plato
Cross the seas in order to attain a knowledge thereof
And you say to yourself, Democritus, what did Democritus give us?
He's that pre-Socratic philosopher who gave us the atom
Yeah, your concept
Everything that modern physics is based on
It's a conception from the mind of a pre-Socratic philosopher
Who studied and wrote about magic extensively
Extensively
Good, good
Let's get another quote from Plenty
It was Democritus, too, who first drew attention to Apollo beckys of Comptos
To Dardanus and to Phoenix
The works of Dardanus, and yes, that's the famous Dardanus who we call the Greeks after
We call them Dardanians
Yes, that's him
He sought in the tomb of that personage
You always bury your magic scrolls with you
Numus doing it for a reason
And his own were composed in accordance with the doctrines there found
Give me one more, give me one more text
There is also a marvelous coincidence in the fact that the two arts, medicine, I mean magic
Were developed simultaneously
Medicine by the writings of Hippocrates and magic by the works of Democritus
So right away they should throw you a little bit
Wait a minute, the origins of that Greek literary magic
Where we have books that contain these magical principles and premises and spells and incantations and hymns
That all of these things literally go back to a pre-socratic wave of renaissance-like thought
Yes, they do, they do
But we'll see that the earlier forms of this that come from this Persian magus
That these Medo-Persian magus
These forms are ultimately where Pliny is going to say all of this interaction took place with the drugs
All of this knowledge
Pliny tells us about the magi using drugs to interrogate
And he says they have wonderful drugs for causing you to hallucinate
For you to be able to see things that are horrific, that are incredibly scary
And all the magus has to do who's performing the interrogation is to give you the drug
And then for himself to take in the demon, the daimon
And to express that daimon to this drugged person
And that person will tell you the truth as they perceive it
They will reflect what exactly they perceive
It's amazing, it's amazing technology
So Pliny tells us that the magi do this, they're the best interrogators and they work against conspiracies
You want to find out what the other conspirators are?
Drug the guy that you catch and get their names and locations
So what does that have to do with the Bible study?
What does that have to do with the Bible study?
Of course, the evangelicals are not going to know this
The guys at the seminary who claim to be Greek experts are not going to know this
Why? Because the only thing they ever read was their own little text
And when you do that, you don't develop a vocabulary
You develop an inbred, two-headed, three-eyed monster
It's disgusting, it's disgusting
Don't tell me you can translate those texts, you can't
I'll take any of you on
Yeah, breathe heavy, heavy breathing
