And kind of look at that side
That narcotic side, if you will
Of everything
I wanted to tie this all up
To a nice, with a nice bow
And say
The world that we're learning
About that's there
In the Greek
Is not the world that we're being given
There is
An ideological war
I'm in complete agreement
Derek is right
There's an ideological war going on
And that war has been going on
For a long time
And it is meant
To obscure
Reality
It is obfuscation
At its best
Christianity
As they said in antiquity
Is meant for one thing
One thing alone
Power
The acquisition of power
When you start burning down
The museum
You
Are doing so to set
Your path to power
We are in conflict
The things that I say
Are not what your preachers are going to tell you
But you should know they're out there
They're out there and they're real
And we have a duty
We have a duty as servants of the muse
We have a duty to protect those texts
And those who claim to be guardians
Who have taken these New Testament texts
And say these are ours
You seminarians, you priests
Shame on you
For letting your guard down
Shame on you
For claiming
Your expertise when you have
None
It's disgusting
Long live the muse
Hail Satan
