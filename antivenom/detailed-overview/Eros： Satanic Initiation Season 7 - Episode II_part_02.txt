Because she's been nourished by God in the inner sanctum.
It was angels that were giving it to her.
Angels.
Angels.
OK.
Do you see anthropologically what's going on?
Fine.
Let's hit another text.
Here we go.
I just want to put kenteo here up the verb.
And I want you to notice it means to be stuck, to be jabbed,
or to be bineo at the bottom.
And what is that bineo?
Uh-oh.
It means to inire.
Oh, look, they're so.
Victorians were so sly.
They were so worried about sex that they had to put crosses
in the form of funny words.
Crosses.
They're censoring, right?
What?
You're using the Latin to translate the Greek.
That's not fair.
That's not fair.
It's not fair.
But what does inire mean?
If you know Latin, you know what goes in and comes out.
And goes in and comes out.
Goes in and comes out.
Boom, boom, boom.
Can you hear the drums?
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
And you hear it.
Boom, boom, boom.
Right, eros.
Can you feel eros?
Oh, God.
It's purification, people.
It's purification.
Most people don't know that eros.
As a matter of fact, anybody out there from Harvard,
those knuckleheads, the knuckleheads in the ivory tower
of knuckleheadery, they don't realize
because they don't delve into the text.
They don't dig down to those fragments.
They don't find that mystery where it lies.
They won't go to the sciences.
They won't go.
Shame on you guys.
You won't go.
But eros there is that purification.
If you ask them, what is eros?
Oh, ask somebody.
OK?
And then forget what they say.
Eros is the lover of the human soul.
He brings purification.
Eros is the lover of the human soul.
He brings purification.
For the orphics, this is prime.
Do you have a problem with eros being winged?
Do you have a problem with him being the winged dragon?
Do you have a problem with him being the bright morning star?
Oh, my goodness.
You say eros is Venus?
Eros is Aphrodite?
Oh, sons and daughters of Venus.
Are there any of you out there?
Sons and daughters of Venus?
Yes.
This is the stuff.
This is the stuff that floated the oracles
and the stuff that forms the empire.
This is the Bacchic backbone that we're talking about right
here.
Eros, where does Bacchus always lead us?
Leads us straight to her.
Straight to her.
Oh, God.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
OK, I need some fascinating stuff to help people out.
And immediately getting up, coming out of the water,
what happened?
He saw the uranus.
He saw it.
Opened up.
Right now, this is the uranus.
Most of you will think this is Jesus and Mark,
getting baptized by John.
And he comes out of the water.
And we see these pictures in Sunday school.
We had, oh, here comes the dove, right?
Coming out of the sky.
This is right before he goes into the Eremon.
Not the topos, but the Eremon.
He goes into the void.
Are you ready to go into the void with Jesus?
Come here, kiddies.
Let's follow Jesus right into the void.
What happens when he comes out of the water?
Aiden, he saw.
What did he see?
What did he see?
Because the rest of us are looking around like, what?
What did he see?
He looks up into uranus.
And he sees descending from the plenum, the spirit of God.
Do you know how to get high in Christianity and Judaism?
It's via the pnellma, by that spirit.
When you're sitting there as one of the sons of Aaron, right?
And you're doing your thing.
When you're one of the Levites and you're coming forward
to do your thing, you're standing at that altar
with the enclosed tent around you.
You're sucking in that vapor that's
coming off the burnt offering.
And you've got that rope around your leg,
and it's tied there so that if you fall over,
they can pull you out before you die.
When you're surfing those spaces like that,
you are entering that void.
And it's from that void that the voice comes.
You know why they're always trying
to bring the voice of God to some kind of tent?
They're trying to bring him in and have him.
Look, he's going to speak, right?
