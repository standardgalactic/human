and who are involved in the sex and the temple worship
with the children?
Why not be involved with these people?
Yeah, why not be involved with these idolaters?
Because they were.
If they're having to root that out in the early church,
it means they were.
It means it's an integral part of Christianity.
It's the reason.
We just found the reason that Jesus,
when he's arrested, screams out,
I am not a trafficker.
I am not a child trafficker.
These drugs that they're using within the cult
maintain control.
Imagine this people just for a second
and I'll end on this.
And I wanna get my goat in a second.
Don't bring him up yet.
Her up, I'm sorry.
But what happens if you've got a religion,
you need to maintain control of your people.
You need them to believe certain things.
You need them to act certain ways.
You need them to baptize their kids.
You need them to marry within the church.
You gotta control all of those aspects of their life
from birth to death.
It's what religio does.
It's what religio does.
Now imagine this.
Your religion has people who are initiated
who come in not knowing and they leave knowing.
They leave born again.
They leave born again.
These second deathers enter into the state
and receive some kind of knowledge.
And in the process, they are written
into the scroll of Zoe.
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
And why?
Because she's the one, she's the Aphrodite
who has that pathway.
I told you, you cannot give up the virgin.
You cannot turn away from the virgin.
It's her song.
If you forsake the virgin Mary,
everything is done.
You can wrap up your religion.
It's gone.
That's what they're doing the mystery for
in order to produce this vessel for the divine.
Are you out there?
Do you want to possess the divine?
Do you want to possess the divine?
There's a program for getting there
and imagine the control people.
If you're not just taking communion,
which is some kind of wine or grape juice
if you're Baptist, right?
Because God forbid you should touch
bachic blood, right?
When you take that communion,
you're not taking it as anything but a refreshing drink
and a little bit of a cracker.
You want a real communion?
You Christians out there,
you want a real Christian communion?
You want real flesh and blood?
You want that body and blood?
You're gonna have to go through the process
of entering death and being resurrected.
And I know you haven't.
You do not by any stretch of the imagination
if you are a Christian today possess ionic life.
You don't.
You have an insurance policy in your head.
That is it.
You haven't been there.
You haven't been initiated.
You don't know.
These are the people that you must steer clear from.
That's why they end up getting crucified.
All right, we came to the Eremon, the void tonight.
I want to thank you.
I want to thank you for your time.
And I want to say if we are careful and pay attention
to the symbols, not the images,
but the symbol that is the code, the secret code,
the two sides that come together,
the impulse and the response.
If we come back to that,
then we know we're in the right place.
Scientifically, we found it.
We've hit pay dirt, right?
Once you get down to that cult's basis,
once you can get into it and see the cult working,
once you see those early Christians,
why the Romans are saying,
stop frigging your children, right?
You know that you've entered that territory.
You can taste it and you can trace it
through all the drugs.
Thank you for coming tonight.
I want to be able to provide for you a perspective
as you're going through all seven spheres
so that you never lose sight
of what we're really shooting for.
What we're really shooting for
is that dirt in the text.
That dirt is there.
You will see Jesus for the first time in your life.
You will see him for the first time
when you get down to that dirt.
Thank you for coming tonight, Hail Satan.
You never came for payment fortune,
all the worldly renown.
On the day that it came and again,
you just turned it down.
All the way.
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way.
Why did you ever change your name?
Come on.
All the way.
