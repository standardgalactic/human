I let that liquor drown my days Now I'm taking my last ride
I paid the highest price you can pay And I'm on my way to Potter's Field
The Palmer's Grave is where I'll be To rest until the end of time
For all eternity
The Lady Babylon Satanic Initiation
This is going to be a great time
Because today I can promise you one thing
Today I can promise you are kicking down that door
We're going to take that guard down
And then we're going to castrate Jehovah
That's what we're going to do
We're going for the big guy tonight on Satanic Initiation
Satanic Initiation
Hail Satan, good to see everyone
Tonight we're going in and we're reclaiming
According to our mandate
According to our mandate
For the fifth season we are to take back
These blessed books that have been maligned
For so long through time by mortals
Tonight we're taking it back
And I'm going to take you to the giants
Now this is going to be special
Because I'm not taking you to any fairy book giants
I'm not doing it
I'm not taking you in to see some kind of Grim Brothers
Awful transmogrification of the real pre-socratic wisdom
I'm not doing that
I'm taking you back
We're getting in that ship and we're going back
And we're going to shake the hands of a couple of giants
I got two giants for you tonight
I got two giants
We're going to shake their hands to find out who they are
We will start out with a little bit of propaganda
These
I want you to watch two
I want you to watch two Orphic hymns
Orphic hymns, remember the images
These things should have a warning with them
Because the images are those which are putting you into the state of initiation
Remember that
The song is everything
Chewie, take us to...
It was a golden age
But we're here for the testicles of God himself
What we need to do
