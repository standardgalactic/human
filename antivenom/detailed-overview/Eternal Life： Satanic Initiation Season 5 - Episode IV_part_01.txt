Is we need to get by Michael at the door
We need to approach the throne
We need to take it out
We need to cut off those testicles
Who is in it with me tonight
To take the testicles right off
We're going to establish a new reign
And we're going to do it
We're going to do it through this power of ion
Love it
Now, what do we need though?
We need one more thing
Before we go
The ship's still running, right?
But we need one more thing before we go
We need her
Everybody knows we need her
Who? You say who?
We need her
We need her to chart the course
We need her to guide the way
We need her
Chewie, hit the hyperdrive
Let's go right to Rea
