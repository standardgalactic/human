is tantamount to taking you in a back alley
and having way with you.
Yes, very bad.
Shame on these people.
Shame on these people.
And why do people believe this?
Because we have to.
If it logically works out within the Judeo-Christian mystery,
the languages have to follow each other
and that original source has to be Hebrew.
They can't live, their universe shatters without that.
The Masoretic sect in the 10th century
starts crying out from their graves,
oh, we created you a text.
And that tradition has bound you for a thousand years.
Yes, yes, it's time to wake up.
What is the ion?
Where do we always go here at Lady Babylon?
We go to the Medwa, right?
We go to the Arians who call themselves the Medoi.
Yes, all because of this one woman.
Where else would we go?
Where else is interesting except Lady Babylon?
Seriously.
Love it, love it.
Okay, tonight I'd like to bring you a text
where we can see the ion
and to show you that it has been poorly, poorly,
terribly mistranslated and criminally perhaps as eternal.
Yes, eternal.
Seriously, guys.
Okay, let me pull up the Medea text.
This is the fourth Pythian ode.
And it is a record of Medea's Oracle.
Of Medea's Oracle, beautiful.
Thank you very much, Chewie.
So what is, take it down for a second.
What is Medea's Oracle?
Medea's Oracle as well.
It's one of the Oracles of Medea
that she handed down from Thera, Santorini.
Woo!
And this was before the explosion.
Yeah.
Anyway, she handed down this Oracle of the future
that was kept by the Pythia.
That's awesome.
Was kept by the Pythia and the Pythia went ahead
and released it when the inquiry was there
that was relevant to the Oracle.
It was about the founders of Cyrene
and some stuff in Northern Africa, good stuff.
Anyway, so this is Pindar's record
of that Oracle.
And in it, we have the word Ion.
And I just wanted you guys to see what the Ion is.
You know, Ion is Hera.
Hera is making sure, let's bring up the Greek.
Hera is making sure that everybody is falling in love
with Jason's ship, wants to go on the Argo.
And what are they sailing to do, right?
He doesn't want them to, third line down,
third line down on this one.
I just want to show you the Ion.
Where'd you go?
There we go.
Second line, one, two, three, four, five, six,
word in, Iona, okay?
So there we are.
And he doesn't want them to have,
to be staying there with their mothers.
Hera doesn't want them to be staying there
with their mothers.
Having an Ion Akin Dunon.
What is Akin Dunon?
That's something that lacks any sort of danger.
Lacks any sort of danger.
