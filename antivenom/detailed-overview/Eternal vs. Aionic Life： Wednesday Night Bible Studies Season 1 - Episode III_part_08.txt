Yeah, in order to be in paradise,
you got to be facing the mirror.
You got to be facing Edim.
Oh yeah, you begin to see it.
Can you taste it?
Yeah, so yeah, he was dead and alive.
He came back, right?
And put his right hand on him saying, don't be afraid.
Now, looking how Jesus identifies himself here, verse 18,
17.5.
Ego, Amy.
I am.
I'm the first in the PGM accomplishment.
Finish, the finishing.
Love it.
Eschatology.
Carozone and the living.
He is the living.
He's not offering you the Zoe.
It's the Ionian Zoe.
He's offering you and the living.
And I became dead, neck cross, and behold, I am alive.
Eistus ionas ton ionon.
How do you translate that?
It's in the plural.
It says into the ions of ions.
There has never yet been written
a good English translation of that expression.
And if I were to walk into your pastor's office,
if I kicked down his door and walked in
through my Greek text in front of him and said,
listen, you little braggart,
tell me, what does this expression mean?
He wouldn't be able to.
He wouldn't be able to.
No, no.
Yeah, why?
Because they don't read.
They just pretend to.
All right, anybody who tells you they do Greek?
Yeah, okay.
It's rich.
It's deep.
It's deep.
You say it with reverence and fear.
A classical philologist says that with reverence and fear
because they've seen the great, wonderful depths of Greek
and they've swam.
They know, they know and respect its beauty.
And anybody who tells you they know it probably doesn't.
They just have had a couple of semesters.
I left Dallas Theological Seminary.
I went to the president and I was like,
look, I just started my THM program
and I have a bachelor's in classics
with a double major in Greek and Latin.
So your program is weak.
And he was like, yeah, brah.
He didn't say brah.
I mean, may have said brother,
but he was like, yeah, brah.
It is.
He confessed it was weak.
It wasn't what it used to be.
I had looked at some scholars who'd come there
when they were all reading Lewis Berry Shaffer.
And so I knew and it was just weak.
Seminaries are weak.
They are weak.
I went into a seminary
and within a very short period of time, two years,
within a very short period of time,
I had people saying, what are they students doing?
Their Greek is suddenly fantastic.
They didn't even have to know that anymore.
He should have just been teaching them Latin.
What's in the popes?
