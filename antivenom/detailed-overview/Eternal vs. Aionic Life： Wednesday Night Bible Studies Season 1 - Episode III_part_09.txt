Decrees?
Anyway, yeah.
Look, he's into the ions of ions.
That's a prepositional phrase there.
Into the ions of ions.
Yeah.
What does it mean?
I'm engaging.
I am that.
Ions of ions.
Phew.
Now, for God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son
that whosoever believeth,
let's get a love of the King James,
on him should not perish,
but have
ion.
Interesting.
Yeah.
You have just uncovered a new reality.
There is no eternal life
that is such an absurdity.
It's a self-contradicting statement, right?
Because the ion is by definition,
especially if you're Pythagorean
and you have a connection to 10,
deck ad.
Does anybody know the deck ad?
No, nobody knows deck ad.
Phew.
Don't eat the cabala on the way there, right?
Cabala's later.
It's medieval.
It's off.
Anyway,
here we have the fruit and we're looking at it.
Here we have the ion.
The ion is outside.
It's outside of the time.
So a definition of eternal for it is sad,
is sad.
And I can talk about other Greek words used for eternal.
I can talk about a simple adverb and it's roots
and the relation to the verb Io,
meaning to comprehend or to perceive.
And Eides, being Hades,
who is the one who was invisible.
The perception of the invisibility,
the phonase, the Saturn, you big doh.
Does everybody see it?
We're right back to Saturn.
The verbs take us there, the language.
The language absorbed all this stuff.
It's like a fingerprint.
The Jews and the Christians worship
a satanic divinity.
That's a profound moment.
Christians worship a satanic
divinity.
That's so lovely, thank you for coming tonight.
We had a couple of questions, but I've had so much fun, and that's a lot to absorb.
And I think what we're going to do this time is just say, hey, all of you who are writing
in with great questions, I'm trying to get to them all.
It may take me some time, and for those of you who have sent me email requests for communications
or zooming, I appreciate it, and I will get through all of those if I have time.
I'm trying, I'm trying.
I love your comments and your questions, and I will return you a response within a couple
of days.
I'll get on the fine time to get on and take you guys extremely serious.
I appreciate everything, and I want you to have a great week.
I'll see you at Satanic Initiation.
Hail Satan.
