I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' to keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should've said
But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows
When I say, never was the cause for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
It's good to see you again. Tonight we're going to have a very productive evening
I'm going to send you to Eternity
We're also going to talk some details
of some things that are coming from our investigation
We're in for some good news
Yes, we're in for some good news
Well, I won't get to it
Until we roll the clip
So what's this good news, you say?
Yes, it turns down, the pole lords have handed down a what you would call a grand jury indictment
Yes, of the Son of God, yes they have
They've handed it down
So now, remember we are outside of time, right?
We're talking about bringing the future and the past together and compressing them
Do you know what kind of physics it takes to compress the future and the past into the present?
That is a chronic trick
Yeah, it takes a lot of skill
Tonight we're going to look at this process
We're going to go to Eternity
But we have some prison transfer to deal with first
We have yet another member who will be joining our population, our prison
And it is our duty as guardians of this place of incarceration
It's our duty to put the hurt on these
So, yeah, the watchers are watching and understand what's going on
We've got yet another incarceration
Who's next on the list, Chewie?
Bring us the clip, we've made a clip for you tonight

When young people have immense concern to all who have public responsibilities
My past visits to the church in every part of the world
have been deeply moved by the almost universal conditions of difficulty in which young people grow up and live

Now, the current Pope has come out to denounce any sort of implication
That the great previous Pope who is a saint
We don't want to look at what he's done
But if that exorcist, that chief exorcist, it always comes down
The history always comes down to the necromancers
It's really funny that chief exorcist was right
And this was a way, Emanuella was just a way for the great father to procure another girl
