It's the one time that Saturnian forces can be free
Yes, love it, love it
I'm going to bring you the words of the Celestials
Yeah
Listen, oh holy court of the blessed in heaven
Who possesses the sacred precincts of Olympus
And steadfast for all eternity revolve around the bright dwelling of Jupiter
On a nine-circled wheel, wait a minute
Oh, I'm sorry, this is going to get complicated
I lose it, right around the physics, that's when I lose it
So just hang in there with the analogies, right?
The math will get you every time
You've got to have a knowledge of...
What's up?
Yeah
Inspiring awe by your radiant visages
Your radiant cheeks, your radiant locks
And clothing is a cloud that reflects
The rays of the round fiery globe of the sun
Lamp of the day and when leaving her cold bed
Aurora glows at the approach of the new day
Do you see where we came setting wise?
I took you right to dawn
We went right to dawn, why did we do that?
Because we're in a cult following Dracula
And Dracula goes right to dawn
Let those who have ears hear
Aurora glows at the approach of the new day
Each time she awakens the weary hearts of mortals
To return to their labors
Which a short time ago found relief in sweet repose
Free of care
Listen to us
Blessed image of good palace
Wait, who?
Palace
Palace Athena
Yes, on top of the hill
Remember her who nourishes the snake
Blessed temple of palace
A guide to those who have followed
In your footsteps as far as possible
And free us from our chains
And from the heavy burden that oppresses us
We are transcending the confines of our base servitude
You traverse the heights of heaven
With a masculine firmness
Yes, that's her, right?
That's the virgin on the hill
Oh, you mean these guys who were in the service of Dracula?
