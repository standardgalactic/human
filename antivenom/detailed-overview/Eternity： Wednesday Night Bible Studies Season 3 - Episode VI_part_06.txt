You just, you didn't have
They couldn't hold a candle
Those Victorians
To you guys
In the realm of grammar and syntax
But when it came to defining a word
It just wasn't there
On the German side
Naughto Kern is screaming
Hey, there's a secret language
Yes, right?
That's what we bring as eternity
Who is she?
She's that Regina
The Regina of that great ion
You say, wait a minute
That's above everything
Yes, outside of everything
Is that great queen
How do you cure a Nazi?
You cure him with the great mother
It's not amazing
We sit
We talk about things like artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence
Not realizing that everything is bound by eternity
And she
She is that great mother
That great mother
Fantastic, it's gorgeous
Youth, youth is her constant companion
Along with virtue
And both of these daughters
Yes, both of these assistants
Come, help, help me to make the drugs
Help me, right?
Where are my Scythian maids?
Where are my Scythian maids?
Did I bring up Eros?
Did I bring up Eros?
Right, he's the one
Who you're going to see from within the cave
He is that lightning
That fills that cave
That she is waving
This is the Gnostic Enformer
Who will be able to identify her now
It's Nix, right?
Exactly, Eternitas
You're finding the first oracular way
