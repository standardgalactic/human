The very first mystery comes through her
Yes
I can give you some stolen lines
I have six minutes
I can give you some stolen lines
And I can show you
Her
All-encompassing
Mystery operation
Just really quick
In our last few minutes here
By the way, for Project Medusa
I need to see
At the order tonight
I need to see
Our chief bio-engineer
I need him to report on Project Medusa
Please, if you can do that
I know it's last minute
But we need to bring this secret stuff in
Good, fantastic
Yes
I want to take you to the second
Should we call up that second
Bit of Latin?
Yes
And I just want you to see some of the
Some of the way that we picture her
That the dragon is able to bring eternity
Right?
For example, through the hand of Uintah
What is the hand of youth?
I mentioned this goddess
You thought, you know, unless you were an evangelical
Atheist, right?
Remember, the monotheists are all atheists
Right? That's what they are
They don't believe in a goddess
Called justice
It's just the way it is
But
Uintah, who is this Roman divinity
What are her hands?
What are her hands covered with?
Let's go to verse 9
Mike, can you bring up?
Thanks
Look at verse 9
What does she do? She assists
In the banquets
