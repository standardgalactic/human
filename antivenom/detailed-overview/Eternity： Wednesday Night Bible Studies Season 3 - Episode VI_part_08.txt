Right?
In the banquets, she assists in those
Holy divine banquets
Preparing that table
And what does she do?
She pours out in fundera
Her eunile nectar
Her youthly nectar
Purporea Manu
From a purple hand
From a hand stained with the
Purpurium
What was that?
Yeah, no, they've got that
Hand full of what we are
Bringing in the right
When Mary is offered
When she's 12
And she's offered after having been fed
In the holiest of holies
Her stain is purple
Yeah
Yeah, iternitas
Iternitas
Virtue
Establishes the borders
Oh, here, this is the last
Can we throw this in? Yes, we have time
It all has to do with
Stereoscopy
And you know
Some quantum physics
That I'm not sure that I want to
Even start to try to understand
But
I wanted to take you
To her bending on line 26
See where it says
Amfractus Aiwi
Warios Venturaque
Lapsis
Intermixa Legans
Presenti Inclusa Fidelli
Oh my god, what is she doing?
Okay, here's your look in the cave
Are you ready? Here's your look in the cave
She is bending back
The variations
Of the ion
She's what?
