Okay, so, you know, this is the man that's made of that. What does he do? He imbues within his prosopon. He puts within his countenance the breath of Zoe. The breath of Zoe. The breath of Zoe is what becomes his psuche.
Okay, give me the next one. Who is Zoe? Wait, is this the Bible? Yes. Is it Genesis? Yes. Is there a Zoe there? You didn't know there was a Zoe there. Here she is. Verse 20.
It's not a beautiful name. Look, it's the middle word in the bottom line. Zoe. Look at that. Zoe. Love it. It's gorgeous. Zoe. Oh, that's her name. Yeah, Zoe. There is no Eve. There is no Eve. Eve is a shout. Do I have to bring up here? Eusebius, Eusebius, come here.
Nope. Keep the chains on. Keep your little bald head just like that. Eusebius. Ewa is a shout. It is a title that the Bacchians use. One of the cult names of Bacchus. Are you ready? I'm going to release this tonight. Up into the air. Are you ready? This is in that beam of the eclipse, right? This is right on that knife's edge.
Ewa's. Ewa's. Ewa's. The name. The name of Bacchus. The cult name. Ewa's. So everybody knows. Even the early Christian Eusebius knew. Church historian, brah. He knows. It's a Bacchic shout. It's a Bacchic cry. Ewa. Her name was Zoe. Zoe.
Isn't that gorgeous? Yeah, Zoe. Restore Zoe, say the poets. Isn't that nice? Restore Zoe. So let's see. You thought it was the Garden of Eden, right? You thought it was the place in the boop in the beginning and everything comes together and we're coming out of the war. You didn't see any of the gods behind it, did you?
And you wondered to yourself, why is God referring to himself in the plural? Why is he saying if there's only one? How is it that he's saying, oh, shit, now the people are going to become like us? Their eyes are going to be opened. They're going to end up naked in a frolic, a frolic fest.
And the next thing you know, I'm going to be yelling about the seed of Lucifer. It's in Eve. Oh, good gracious. How do they keep this stuff straight? Let's just go right to the text, people. This is Bible. I want you to realize this is the Bible as it has never been taught in this century.
Yeah. Never. Why? Because this has been sealed from us. You thought this was a Hebrew text. It is not. It is not. Let's open it up and read it together for the first time, shall we? Shall we? This man is crazy. Yes, love the mania. It's coming. It's coming. Tonight it's coming. Watch.
Okay. Here it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he called the name of his wife. So yep, let's go on. Next one. Boom. Boom, boom, boom. And yeah, so God, Hothios, who's the courios, the God who is the courios. What does he do? He puts this paradise on. He puts this paradise in Edim. In Edim, my Greek students notice that it's not Eden. It is Edim.
Edim even showing you a new land, a new creation. I'm going to show you Edim. Edim. Now, for those of you who want the extra kick of the magic, because remember, these are the magic books that we've got anyway. If you want the extra kick of the magic, you only have to follow this as far as the cult right allows you to stay there.
Right? As long as you can see the cult right, you're in good place for this magic. Incredible. Are you ready? Let's pull it out. Everybody, hold on. Hold on because it's going to feel a little bit uncomfortable. Give us the next one, Chewie. He put this paradise. Yeah. He put this paradise in the east.
It's eastward toward the rising sun. Right? And there he's put the dude whom he had educated. Right? Who of me had trained for this thing? What's this dude need? It turns out, dude needs that virgin Minerva. Wow. Okay. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Has he drugged Adam yet?
Is anybody? Has he drugged Adam? Yeah. You're okay. I promised you that God drugged Adam tonight. So just wait. Just wait. We'll get there. We'll get there. It's coming. It's coming up. Next one, please. Yeah. And then the Lord, the God who is the Lord, you know, he took the man whom he formed and he, you know, educated and he put him into the paradise.
Now, what does this say on the third line? It says into the paradise, but then it's got a genitive there taste through face. What is the to the paradise of what every English translation has cut this out?
Every English translation that I've seen has cut this out. What this didn't make it, you see, in the back translation of the Hebrew, it didn't make it when it was being forced back by scholars to try to create a Hebrew template.
