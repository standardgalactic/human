Trance. Trance. Anybody in trance out there, people? Anybody in trance? Guess what? It is trance and mania.
We're talking about trance and mania. How do you think you're going to get a regular? How do you think you're going to get a regular if you're not in trance? You want to see Paul in trance? You want to see Paul drug?
What did God do to Adam? He drugged him, made him enter ecstasy. What does Paul do? Paul enters ecstasy, but Paul's ecstasy has to do with a thorn in his flesh, a messenger of Satan and a 13 year old boy.
Wait, what? I didn't hear that. A 13 year old boy. Wait, your honor, can you force this witness to cough that up? Because you repeat your question. Paul with a how old?
13. Not yet 14.
Okay, sure. Are you sure? Let's look at it. Let's look at drugged out Paul doing his thing. Are you ready? Because we are in paradise. You're not going to believe me, but we are in paradise.
I thought you said paradise was a place for sex and drugs and I am I opening things. Yes, I did. And so does Paul.
Should we bring us the next star system? No, we'll come back to that later. Keep going down.
Yep. No. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So Paul says the second Corinthians 12. Paul says I'm just going to translate for this for you. I'll just stand up like this.
I knew a dude in Christ. Wait, what? You knew a dude in Christ. Take that down. You knew a dude in Christ. What does that mean?
Look at the translations of this. It's hilarious that the ones that try to stay so literal, you know, you can't capture the meaning. I knew a person in Christ. I knew them in Christ.
Okay. Go on to the next. Go on. What does it mean? Let's figure out what that means.
Pro-Eton. Pro-Eton. What? Decadesaron. Pre-mature of 14 years. Just before 14 years.
Now, your translations will have caved on this one, right? And they will say 14 years ago. But this is a very strange way of putting that.
And I'm going to say, since we've already mentioned the anthropon, that this is putting the kid's age within framework. And it's perfectly within its rights to do that.
I mean, this is not odd, right? To express age. So he's a little bit before 14 years old. So you knew this guy in Christ, right? Yeah.
