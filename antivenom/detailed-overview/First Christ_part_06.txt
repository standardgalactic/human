Greek, surprise, the zodiac is there.
If you are practicing Orthodox Jew today
and you do not follow Ion and the zodiac,
you're not doing what they did, right?
You're not doing what they did.
So, Yaho is the God that was followed
by monists of the second and first centuries BC, right?
That's the history that comes
from the documents themselves.
Okay, okay, let's get back to that source.
I wanna get back to that source.
Just say a couple of things.
Just look at the Greek people.
Yeobakos is who the ride is celebrated to.
He gathers his women, right?
His women, what do his women do?
They are the voice, dude.
You don't have anything at a Bacchic revel
if you don't have the voice.
Everything is about the female voice.
It's on that line.
It talks about Yahweh that we looked at before.
That feminine voice.
Now, if you think about this for a minute,
I'm telling you, the mystery ride, pre-Christian,
the mystery ride is being brought into existence
through a very specific female voice.
Okay.
Ah.
Chewie, do you wanna show us something?
Okay, Chewie is dying to show us something.
Give it to us.
Give us to us.
Yes, how glorious.
So I will push now.
I've got a lot of comments from women who are saying,
hey, it's nice to see some strong women
who were not, you know, pictured to, you know,
who, you know, maybe you didn't think
this type of person existed.
You know, I was watching the Olympics today
and I was saying to myself,
people are almost getting it.
We're almost getting closer and closer
and closer to the spirit of the Olympics, right?
We're almost, they're starting it out in Greece.
They're taking it serious.
Now we get to the Olympics and look at what we've got.
Look at what we're running in this year.
People will say, oh my God, how revealing, right?
Did you know they ran the original Olympics naked?
That's part of the whole deal.
Have you seen those athletes?
My God, what beauty.
That's how I look at myself
and I think that's how I could have been.
What happened?
Right? Where were my, oh my God.
Take off their clothes.
Olympic committee, take off their clothes.
Let them run.
Don't worry, people get used to it
by the third race, people will be, right?
And then it'll be like, wow, look at that human form.
And then you can worship the human form.
Oh my God, you worship the human form?
Why would you do that?
Because it's thing of beauty.
It's a thing of beauty.
Do you see how monism saps the nature?
Just like Paul was saying, it saps the nature
out of the culture.
Monism needs you to be detached from your natural roots
so that when you look into the eyes of he or she,
he or she, whom you find beautiful,
that there's that incredible thing that happens.
Yeah, ooh, right?
That's what we need to stifle.
This is what Bacchus releases, is this power.
This is what the Christ does.
Okay, okay, let's go to the next,
go to that, the last text again.
Yep, I'm gonna finish it up.
What happens here?
So Dionysus is watching, he raises his thesis, right?
And what does he do?
He juts his head forward and his horns
become his adamantine defense, right?
His horns, he shows his horns.
His horns are that stone, which was petrified
by the rain, Zeus.
What is that?
What is that horn?
It is Alexeterra, second to last line.
Alexeterralithogleneoia, medusis.
Oh my God, medusis, what?
What is it?
It's the Alexeterra, that stone.
What is Dionysus' horn?
I'm giving you right now the very central light
of the mystery.
Are you ready?
When you look at Michelangelo,
when you look at Michelangelo and his Moses has horns,
this is why.
Are you ready?
Right out of the cult's mouth.
It's the Alexeterra of the medusa.
It's the Alexeterra.
What is his horn?
Give me the next one.
