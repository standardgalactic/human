Su ei ho Christos.
You are the Christ.
Okay, are you ready?
So all of the mania that is the Bacchic mania,
all the prophetic power,
Peter is telling Jesus, this is yours, this is yours.
Yeah, son of God, same titles, right?
The Bacchians are using.
And the only way we get to the same cult
is through the same drugs.
The New Testament is not some cheap literature
that's fabricated to try to copy pagan models.
No, no, no, no.
It's a dude who was using the same machinery
to perform the same cult.
And that's exactly what Peter is getting him.
It's where he's getting him, he's nailing him.
And it's perfect, it's a perfect description.
Give me the last line and we'll end up,
now watch this people, these are the translations.
Just so you'll believe me, when I tell you
that theology is garbage, is complete garbage.
Look at the translators, Simon Peter answered.
You are the Messiah.
Wait a minute, what?
Wait a minute, what?
That's not what the text said.
Why would you assume?
Second translation, new living.
Simon Peter answered, you are the Messiah.
Really?
Really, what did King James say?
And Simon Peter answered and said,
thou are to the Christ.
Yes, thou are to the Christ.
Do you see how Christians didn't even know
how to handle their own titles?
Why?
Julian the Apostate warned us,
you cannot allow Christians to educate
using classical sources.
They will change them, they will destroy them,
and you will no longer have classical wisdom.
Do you see what matters to the monists?
What matters to Christianity is the box.
You are either a monist in the box
with the rest of us or you're dead.
We are different from everyone else around us.
We do not live the same history.
We follow a fairytale and we suck it up.
Yeah.
The drugs, people, the drugs show you the difference.
All you have to do is follow the drugs.
And these translators, they get my goat.
I just wanna finish with the translators,
getting my goat.
Great, Penelope.
For those of you who knew to Lady Babylon,
meet Penelope.
Penelope, Lady Babylon.
The cross, you want an explanation, of course.
Just like Hail Satan, you want an explanation.
The cross covers a multitude of sin.
Look at that cross.
Look at the sin that the cross is hiding.
God bless us for that cross.
