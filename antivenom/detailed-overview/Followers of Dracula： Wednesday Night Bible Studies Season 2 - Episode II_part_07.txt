Let's look inside just for a moment inside this hymn that we've gotten.
It's opening up for us.
What is the background of what's being performed in the song?
What's happening?
And when we get there, we find that somebody is consuming the flesh of the God.
Okay?
Everybody cool?
Everybody cool with that?
All you Bacchants, all you Menad women who got together, you have this thing where you
descend from the mountains, and you take out human beings and maraud through villages,
and you tear apart men who shouldn't be messing with you, and you consume the flesh.
You go into the homophagy.
Yeah, you guys won't be offended by any of this.

Okay.
She dreamed she gave birth to a serpent, and what does she do?
She put it in swaddling clothes.
Yeah.
What food did it crave?
The newborn viper.
And the Chorus says, in her dreams, she offered it her own breast, and Orestes says, surely
a nipple was not wounded by the lusts and beasts, and the Chorus says the line relevant
to us and our hymn, no, it drew the clotted blood with the milk.
It drew the clotted blood with the milk, and this is the last line at the bottom.
Yeah.
And it says, Spasi, she's drawing up, she's sucking that, excuse me, that serpent is sucking
