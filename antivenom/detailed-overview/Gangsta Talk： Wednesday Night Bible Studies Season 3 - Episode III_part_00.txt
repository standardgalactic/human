I never meant anything I said Just spittin' up everything I've been fittin'
Keepin' from eatin' away at me Never said anything I meant
I never said the letters that I should have said
But so it's askin' too much for me all to believe
But when I say Never meant nobody no harm
When I say Never was the cause for the long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Hello hello and welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
Tonight I'm gonna take us somewhere dirty
I'm gonna take us somewhere where we're gonna get that stuff on our feet
We're gonna follow one of the strongest women in all time
Yeah, we're gonna follow her to a specific point
And she has been maligned and belittled and turned into a servant of a man
And she was not
And we're also gonna talk about Medea
And we're gonna look at a specific incantation she performs
And we're gonna see her actually working the right
So that you can see the functioning of a mystery
Fantastic, that's what we come for to harvest is that goodies
Yes, that's tonight on Lady Babylon
We've got a couple of real nice clips for you
That we're gonna look at that will help to thoroughly brainwash you
Fantastic, love it
Welcome back
Tonight we're gonna go someplace
A lot of people go
But they go with the intention of demeaning
They go as racist
Or people who want to put people in cages
That's how they end up there
How are we getting there in the Bible?
Put the brakes on
Ship's almost there
That's why he talks to them
So that he can distract him from the fact that we're taking a trip
And tonight we're going to Samaria
We're gonna look at Jesus
We're gonna see
We're gonna see Gangsta G
We're gonna see Gangsta G
We're gonna see what he was doing
He was getting away from the heat
Down in Jerusalem
He's traveling up north
In order to get there
He's got to cross over to Samaria
He's got to cross over Samaria
Yeah
So he's been traveling
He comes across a well
And he sits himself down
And this lady walks up
And he orders her
To give him a drink
He doesn't say
Gangsta G doesn't say
Please
Gangsta G doesn't say
Excuse me, madam
Do you have some water?
Gangsta G says
Give me water
Yeah
Now this woman
This woman who was there
What did she pull out?
She says, listen you racist
What are you doing talking to me?
What are you doing talking to me?
Everybody knows
That you
Don't mix with us
Yeah
That you look on us as inferior
Right
Remember this is the woman
Taking the orders
From a culture where women took orders
Yeah
This is where that man is coming from
He's coming from a culture that orders women around
She's not having any of it
She tells him right up front
This is the greatest passage
That nobody has ever bothered to clarify
Nobody has ever played it
Can you smell the air?
Can you feel that dirt?
Yeah
Yeah
