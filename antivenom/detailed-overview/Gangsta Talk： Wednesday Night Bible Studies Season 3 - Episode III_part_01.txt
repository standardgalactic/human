Forget the fairy tale
This is not the fairy tale
This is not for those who are wanting to partake
Of the holy hymn
Yeah, hit that
Hit that
This is not for us
This is the place where we look at the details
The reason
The reason
And the first thing she does to him, this woman
The first thing she does
She points out, I'm a woman, brah
I'm a woman, number one
You misogynist
And number two
I'm a Samaritan
It was my family that came here
It was my family
Yeah
So we have a, right away we have this
Kind of conflict going on
Kind of conflict going on
I'm going to show you the Greek in a second
But Jesus pulls out
At that point, what does he do?
He's lounging on their well
Yeah, what does he do?
He's gangster G
You know what he tells her?
You know what he tells her?
He tells her, I'm sorry
My people are a bunch of racists
Would you oblige me?
Do we have some way?
No, he didn't say that
He didn't say that
Jesus didn't say that
Gangsta G said, you know who I am?
You know who I am
You know who I am
Yeah
I want to run a little clip for you
I want to look at Gangsta G
See Jesus Christ for who he was
He was a man arrested in a public park
With a naked boy
When you go to drink of his blood
And eat of his flesh
You are promoting a rapist pedophile
Your institutions are the institutions
Of rapist pedophiles
So he's getting in on it
He's going in on a racial question
He's going to talk about superiority with this lady
You want to know who I am?
You want to know who I am?
What does he do?
He turns right to his meth
As you would expect
As you would expect a
Child prostitution ring leading demagogue
Who gets caught in public parks with naked children
He does exactly what you would expect
He pulls out his drug
He pulls out the thing that keeps everybody going
And you can see it in his drug-addled face
You can see it
He's like, I'll give it to you
You could have asked me
I'll tell you who I am
You want to know who gangster G is?
He says, I'm the guy that can get you the water of life
Water of life
Water of life
That's what I'm going to give you
What do you get with the water of life, Jesus?
Because we're all school children
In the grounds
We're just watching this guy standing outside the playground
Dealing his drugs, right?
Giving this woman a hard time
He says, I'll get you the water of life
Do you know what the water of life is?
The water of life will give you
Ionic vision
It gives you that Ionic life
It opens your eyes
It opens your eyes
It'll send you into the air
