And what you bring back with you
Will open your eyes
Will open your eyes
Jesus Christ
Was a child selling drug peddling cult leader
A performer of a mystery
The source of which goes all the way back to the Bronze Age
Yeah
But here he is doing his own function, man
He's out there flying on his own juice, right?
Right? Fantastic
Let's, Chewie hit that clip number two
Hit that clip number two
What happens?
What happens to this process
If we let it keep working its mold?
To me to hear that
Because I heard that for eight years after the revolution
You know, same stuff that Russian, Russia
And basically Russian propaganda that was translated in Russia
Is the same thing people who are anti-Ukraine repeat in other countries
Including America and you know, pretty much everyone
I would say
So this whole thing about LGBT
Which by the way, nothing wrong in supporting LGBT
But yeah, but it's not something that justifies an invasion
But they just use I would say in Russia LGBT as a boogeyman basically
So for them it's an example of like a western degeneracy
I apologize if it sounds rude
But that's how they call it
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
I'm the guy who can come into town
I've got minions
These minions will write laws about you
Yeah, gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
Gangsta G
That woman at the well stood up against him
Face toe to toe
Toe to toe
She wasn't afraid of him
Just like Anastasia is not afraid of gangsta P
Yeah, look at what they're trying to do
You say, hey, this is political
I haven't said a single political thing
Not a single
This is not politics
This is history at present
Pull yourself out
And look at what's going on
Don't join a club
Just look at what's going on
Yeah, it's coming
Gangsta P is coming
I want to shift now
And I want to move to a little bit of incantation
To bring me to a place
Let's everybody get back in the ship
I'll take a drink of tea
We'll set the time now for late Bronze Age
Put the settings, Chewie
On some cult
And let's look at what she's doing
Let's look at what Medea herself is doing
Who's spirit are we sucking up along the way?
Because we're necromancers
Who's spirit? We're going to grab Seneca
We're going to grab the guy that was advising Nero
The guy who had the access to the collection
Yeah
Turns out the emperors were keeping collections
Of scrolls
With ancient knowledge on them
Yeah, a lot of pharmacological stuff too
A lot of cult
Nero comes in
And gives us a ritual performance
Yeah, Seneca
Peers into this ritual performance
Nero supplies the drugs
Through his Arch Mage
His Arch Yathros
His head doctor
His head doctor
Who has got access to the formula
