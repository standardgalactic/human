Tables at the door.
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
Okay, welcome back to Satanic Initiation on Lady Babylon
Tonight there are going to be two groups of you
Those who can make it all the way through the end
Without severe nausea
And those who won't affect it all
But that will be a few, that will be a minority
You say how can you set things up by bringing in something like
Because you know where we're going
We were last time in the temple
In Jerusalem with Jesus
Bringing us new territory
Now we're going to stay with Jesus only this time
Instead of going with him
We're going to bring him up
We're going to bring him up along with Moses
And the party
Tonight we're going into an actual Bacchic Rebel
And I want you, I know that you feel like you can make it all the way through
But you'll regret it at some point
I can promise
Tonight on Lady Babylon
We have to pull out our most holy incense tonight
To be able to purify this place
I mean, bring it, breaks the time
We're going to cleanse out this place
So that we can call in these texts
And I'm going to show you some
Just straight up literal Bacchic ritual
And we're going to be looking at drugs
We're going to be looking at states of mind
And we're going to be looking at catharsis
Yeah
What we need to cleanse this place
Is a little bit of Artemis
We need that daimon
Called Eohiara
Eohiara
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
Something happened
It was Aura
You know what she had the guts to do?
She had the guts to put down Artemis
For the shape of her body
Yeah, she did
And this is what happened to her
Go ahead, Chewie
What we need to cleanse this place
Is a little bit of Eohiara
Eohiara
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
She who pours the poison
I have seen the place
Where the woman is made of bride
She has made that bride next to the rock.
Yes, next to the rock.
Now you thank to yourself.
What does that have to do with?
What does that have to do?
Just wait, just wait.
There's a wedding we need to go to.
Ready?
Everybody, the ship's here.
Everybody get out.
I want you to look right now.
I want you to look into the eyes of a boccan
and what's going on with a boccan.
It's hit me with the first one, Chewie.
Fantastic, blow it up.
Yeah, yeah, nobody.
You know what's going on during the celebration?
Nobody in the city was acoric.
You say acoric, what does that mean?
Nobody didn't dance.
Nobody didn't dance.
That's what happens.
That's what happens with the stuff, guys.
As soon as we get there,
we're not gonna be sitting in pews.
We're gonna be dancing.
Dancing, fantastic.
And Bochus is gonna go visit somebody.
He's gonna go visit Icarus.
Okay, cool, let's hang with him.
Come on, Bochus, we got Jesus.
We got Jesus right with us.
Here he is, let's go.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
This is what Bochus is distributing.
Uh-huh.
A pain-killing intoxication.
A pain-killing intoxication.
If, I want you to look at these words.
Lucie pon oil means to destroy that anguish,
to take away that pain.
And it is used for a specific class of drugs.
It's the name of a class of drugs in antiquity.
The pain killers.
Let's go on.
The pain killers.
So, okay, everybody get the, okay, we're good to go.
Okay, I just want you to notice the name
in the very middle of the second line.
Ganymede.
Bochus tells this guy, he says, look,
we're watching him talk right now.
I'm sorry, what's that?
Bochus, what'd you say?
He said, look, I'm going to make you equal.
Ganymede, ganymede, ganymede.
You're going to be heading up the rights.
You know what people brought up until this point?
You're going to bring them my communion, my communion.
You're going to bring them the blood.
Do you understand my son?
It's the son of God we're talking about.
Don't you get that wrong either?
We come here to worship Bochus at this time in history.
We come here to honor the son of God.
The reason that we have all of the problems
is because people will not embrace
that he is the son of God.
Yes, prove it, Bochus, prove it.
Okay, I'm starting to, can you feel it?
Can you feel the, at least the pain killers?
They give you that right at the door, right?
Let's keep going to the next one.
Why ganymede, yeah, why ganymede?
Go to the next one.
