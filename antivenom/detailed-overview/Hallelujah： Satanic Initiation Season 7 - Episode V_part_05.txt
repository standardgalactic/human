when the Son of God returns,
he's gonna make you his bride.
He's gonna, no, it's okay, Chewy.
It's okay, yeah, he's gonna make you his bride.
You know you're the bride of Christ.
Are you ready to see bride of Christ?
What you're in for?
Yeah, this new Jerusalem.
This new Jerusalem.
What's it gonna be like?
Did you know the foundations of the foundations of Rome?
Do you know what the Templars found?
They found the foundation of Rome
and the city of the seven hills.
That's what they found, Jerusalem.
Let's go to the next pass.
Yeah, the same one here.
Here it is, Revelation.
Well, I heard a voice.
Oh God, they're hearing voices again.
Right?
Are you guys hearing voices?
I mean, the stuff they gave us.
And I heard the voice, a great one.
And it's coming from a throne.
Okay, I think I took something else, people.
Look, there's a tent of God with men
and he's tentifying with men and somebody out there.
I know, I can feel you.
I can feel you, Mason, a free Mason.
I know you're out there.
I know you're out there and you want that skein
to be something dirty.
Free Masons are dirty, right?
What's that skein A to be something, right?
Look for the gland.
Right?
This is what's going to happen.
We're gonna skeinify.
Are you ready to go back to the passage?
Oh God, it's so lovely.
And a lot of people, you know, God himself, right?
He'll be there and a lot of people.
It's gonna be a big crowd, right?
And he's gonna wipe away all your tears, baby.
No tears.
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you,
underneath the influence of the gold,
nobody's gonna care.
If you and I can execute our children or newborns
right in front of everybody and nobody cares, right?
They're gonna eat them anyway, right?
They're gonna have that almost a year, right?
Ooh, gonna have a kind of a watered down barbecue
without the barbecue.
Without the fire.
You ever eat raw meat?
Hey, you wanted a Bacchic revel, right?
You wanted it.
Let's go back to that one, yeah.
And what is he gonna do?
All of this is gonna happen because in that third
to last line,
and there will be no death.
Take it away.
There will be no death.
Do you know why?
Didn't we show you last time, Jesus,
going through the cathartic rituals?
Didn't we show you his magic that he's doing?
Yeah, this is the extension of that.
This is the performance of the mystery.
You go back to that verse one more time.
The same one.
I just want you to notice, people,
death will not exist.
Death will not exist.
Remember what we said?
Those of the second death.
What do we do?
What do we do?
In those days, we are gonna be stuck
because we're going to be searching for death,
but death is not gonna come, right?
Why?
Because the mystery will have been restarted.
The mystery is that salvation from death.
You didn't think Jesus and the resurrections were all
just symbolic, right?
Right?
Yeah, realize the physics is there, right?
You evangelicals may be able to pull out enough.
Common sense to respect what I'm saying.
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go to the next one.
Look what's gonna happen.
There will be no death.
I just want you guys to see it, right?
Why?
Because we've restarted the mystery.
And what does the mystery do?
The mystery avert death.
How does the mystery do that?
By submerging you in that transit.
Right?
Right into that black hole.
Love it.
It's gonna open your eyes, right?
Jehovah was trying to do that from the start.
What do you think Eve was for?
You gotta have the water of life
if you wanna take Adam, your boy,
to the place where he goes beyond and comes back
and has the knowledge.
Has the knowledge.
It's like a God.
It's like a God.
You know how you burn off somebody's mortality?
I wish we would start.
I wish we would start.
Let's go to the next one.
Love it.
Okay.
Hey, for the rest of you.
For the rest of you.
Just give in to that fear of Christ.
Right?
Now, wait a minute.
I didn't say anything about fear.
I forgot to mention people.
The drugs that they've been giving us,
you know, that makes us kill our children.
Those drugs make us exceptionally fearful.
Fearful.
What do we fear?
We fear the Christ.
This language that you find in the New Testament
is not separate and distinct
from the environment of the classical world.
Jesus did not suddenly appear within a vacuum.
Yeah.
He is using the machinery that is there at the time.
Has anybody noticed that we've been doing Greek
the whole time, that everything Jesus says is in Greek?
Because they were not speaking Hebrew.
Yeah.
It was liturgical.
And it pissed people off, but too bad.
Languages die.
Right?
Deal with it.
Greek kicked, but across the world.
Wasn't just Hebrew.
Gee, how many languages did the Roman world wipe out?
Right?
Oh, thanks, Evander.
Evander gave him the alphabet, you know,
