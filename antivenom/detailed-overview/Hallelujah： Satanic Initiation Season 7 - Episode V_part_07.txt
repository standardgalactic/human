She wouldn't need him, right?
When you get there, take it down from what I was saying,
when you get there and you realize that you don't need him,
you know why he puts a guardian there, right?
He puts a guardian.
Who kept that way?
The light bringer kept that way.
Mr. Reason himself kept that way.
He allowed her.
He allowed her to contravene the orders
of the mongrel God who was with the boy Adam.
Now, when I say Theos there, hear from antiquity.
Hear from the Bronze Age.
Theos, hear it, right?
Hmm, can you see him?
I can see him.
People say don't make an image of Allah or God, right?
Don't make an image.
I got one right here, right here.
And it's not complimentary.
Why?
Because we're children of Eve.
Yeah, let's be children of Eve.
I love that.
That was beautiful.
Those romantics were nuts.
Let's go.
Have more and that's it because we are way,
again, way over time.
What is that speed loss?
That's just the, I just wanted you to see
that it's some kind of naughtiness, right?
Flack or blemish.
It's just some kind of mark or blemish.
And what, let's go back to Paul.
What is it?
What is it?
Christ did want, he loved you
and gave himself for you, for us, right?
As a offering, something brought forward
and thusia as that burnt sacrifice.
And what does that burnt sacrifice do?
It's a beautiful smell.
It is Eodias.
Wait, it is Eodian?
Did I tell you?
Did you guys see on the pot when we came in
and they had that stuff that causes the pain killing?
The initial drug that we all took to get into the mystery.
Did anybody notice that written on that pot
was the very same?
Was something, go back to that, Chewie.
Was something very same?
What was written on that pot?
What was written on that pot?
Eodia.
That which is most pleasing to the smell.
To the smell.
A eodic drug.
Compounds are eodic.
And what does notice tell us?
The compound that Dionysus gives us,
he tells us it is eodic.
Eodic.
You didn't know Jesus was carrying around
the same thing, did you?
Yeah, remember?
Remember what he got so pissed about in the temple?
You can't bring that scale of sin, right?
This is my thing, right?
Let's go, let's go back up.
Yep, just to the next source.
Yeah, keep talking, Paul, keep talking.
Nope, next one.
Yep.
Okay, and you gotta know this stuff, man,
that every, what does Paul say?
He says every pornos.
Every pornos.
Every acathartos, right?
Every pleonectes.
Yeah.
Wait, what kind of people are you talking about?
Everyone who's a porne or a pornos.
Remember a pornos can be a 12-year-old boy, right?
It's somebody who is being used within the trafficking,
right, the sex trade.
And what else?
Unclean, acatharsia, or anybody who has that acatharsis,
right, who's acathartos, right?
Everyone who is that.
What are they?
They are idolaters.
They are idolaters.
If you go through one of these purifications,
you're gonna end up performing idolatry.
And if you look up porneia, you'll find that it is
not only temple worship, but at the very same time,
it is temple sex, it is acts that cause you
to enter into a sexual state, right?
Even if they're using virgin priestesses
who are not de-virginified
to retain their irracular power, okay?
So there's still sexual acts going on in these rites.
All right, all right.
Now, I promised you Moses would show up.
Where's that guy?
Come on, Moses, bring me those.
Keep going.
This is the next one, just do the next one.
Yeah, here's some translations.
You know, no immoral, impure, or greedy.
Okay, keep going, go down.
Who is sexually immoral or impure, covetous, right?
Okay, keep going.
Nor unclean person, nor covetous man, right?
Who happens to be an idolatry?
That's a terrible translation.
King James sucks sometimes.
Keep going.
New American standard, which tends to be the most literal.
Impure person, no immoral or impure.
Okay, see how even they're kind of brushing aside
what that actual purity is talking about, right?
We're talking about Ganymede.
There's a reason that Zeus drinks from his rectum.
Don't get upset at me.
It's in the Pripyat.
Some British knight wrote a whole treatise
on all of these aspects.
There's sodomy and what it was within the ritual,
dildos, there's all sorts of things
that have to do with sexual gratification and ritual.
Because this is all under the umbrella of Lord Pripus, right?
Now you didn't think, would you be surprised
if Jesus is standing in the place of Pripus?
Oh, now I understand the boys.
Now I understand the boys that are with Jesus.
It's a necessary occupational vehicle,
the boys that they're using, right?
Okay, good.
Let's go to the next one.
Not good for them, you know, the jigs up with these people.
But I just want you to see a little bit of fragment here.
This is just a little bit of Silene speaking.
We're going to the cave of Hermes.
We're going to his nurse, Kuleene.
And she says, mainuna piste, don't be in disbelief, right?
Trust what that goddess gives you.
Yeah, and the chorus sings back
and how, right?
How can we believe that this dead thing gave out a voice?
This corpse, dead, how do we know that they thunder?
Are you ready, people?
We're a debauched rave, right?
Are you ready for the dead to give their voice?
Because that's what we are.
