You are not who you were.
You're dead.
Silene says, believe it, right?
For being dead, right?
That dead person has a voice.
But when they are alive, they're just a voiceless beast.
Okay, that was a little bit extra
for the people who like to solve the puzzles, okay?
I want you to.
That was a little extra picture
of what's going on within the rite.
Give me the next one.
And finally, 1st Corinthians 10.
Did he find me again here?
How you doing, Moe?
How you doing, Moe?
No, you came dressed inappropriately.
Take off, Moses, take off your clothes, Moses.
Right, let's show you the rites.
Are you ready?
Blow this up, Chewie.
I'm just gonna translate this, people.
Yeah, I don't want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers,
that our fathers, all of them,
they were underneath the influence of the cloud.
Yeah, and all of them came through the sea,
through the midst of the sea.
Yeah, and all of them what?
All of them were baptized into Moses.
Take it down.
Baptized into Moses.
And the Orthodox Jews in the group say,
well, we don't care.
That's your New Testament garbage.
We don't care about that, right?
It's fine, you can put up that wall,
but you should know you rabbis and scholars of the Torah.
You should know that people in the first century
who were reading your Septuagint are saying,
Moses is a Baptist.
Moses is a Baptist.
You mean, wait a minute,
you mean all that funny snake stuff that Moses was doing
and the snake on the stick and all the healing?
Yeah, it's all Baptist.
You were baptized into Moses.
Now, originally, what this concept was
is you are submerged in the muse, moussa.
But what it became was you were baptized into Moses.
It's no different people, right?
Every religious Jew on the planet owes a debt of gratitude
to the Greeks who established their irracular cult.
Moses would be nowhere without them.
And maybe some priests,
maybe some Egyptian priests throw them in there, right?
Alexandrians, yeah, love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Isn't it nice to discover where you're from, right?
And you can see that Christianity and Judaism
are just variations of this very cult
that we are talking about
that we're trying to get straight up, right?
Look at.
Now, what is, I wanted you guys to see this definition.
I should have used it earlier,
but this is what happens, it's okay.
This is what happens when the Bakken enters into the state
that they can end up doing a thing
that has the root pi, right?
Pi, paidos, meaning child, paizo, right?
What am I gonna do?
When I am under the influence of the cult
and I am in my psychosis
and I am seeing my two sons
and I am sacrificing the children,
what kind of mental place do I get to?
I get to a place that I want to dance.
Dance, it is a place that I want to play.
Just look at the definitions.
It's a place that I want to play on a musical instrument,
which they do for some reason.
The music guides this group of maniacs, right?
And women are the ones who pioneered this.
It's only late that men get involved, right?
And that's part of why you have
John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, right?
Cool, so look what else does it mean?
Number five, play amorously, what?
You mean they use a word for playing amorously
that uses the root for child?
Yeah, sportive, to be sportive, like a child, frolicsome.
It's like a, do you ever see a little deer
jumping about, little young one,
jumping about, right, around mommy?
Yeah, that sportive, I'm not used to using that word,
it's not really used anymore,
but that kind of frolicsome behavior
is what the Balkans are known for.
So take it down, I just want to give you the big picture
within this right that we have just come to.
We are now in a state, we started out drinking
some painkillers, I haven't felt a bit of pain.
We entered into taking that gold,
it's filling our veins, it's burning off our mortality,
and what do we do?
We offer up our children, right?
We offer up our children.
And what happens after that with all of this?
Well, Jehovah gets mad, bring us back to Corinthians.
Watch what happens, people, watch what happens,
you know that they were baptized into Moses,
you know that they were, yeah, and all of them,
what did they do?
They ate, wait a minute, they ate what?
They ate a pneumatic broma,
and that word broma, just leave it up to me,
that word broma can be food, something that is secreted.
Wait, what?
Yeah, it can be or dur, it can be poopy poops,
it can be something that goes through your intestines,
this is how it's used in the Gospel of Mark.
It's not what goes into you that corrupts you,
because watch what happens, that stuff just goes
through your bowels and ends up getting extruded.
It ends up getting extruded is broma.
It ends up, wait, what?
You mean your body can process something into broma?
Yes, and that is what they are eating.
They are eating pneumatic broma, what is pneumatic broma?
I don't know, I don't know, I'm gonna pass on that one,
I'll stop with the goal.
The pneumatic broma, let's just leave it that,
but it does something to you.
Did you remember that manna?
Did you know that they were all on drugs?
Manna is a drug, it's a Greek drug and a Greek name.
It is not Aramaic, it is not Hebrew.
Hebrew did not exist when manna existed, yeah.
But you know what manna does, yeah you do, yeah you do.
Manna sustains us, manna is what they gave
to Mary, the virgin mother of Jesus Christ
when she was in the temple,
being nourished by angels, manna is what they gave her.
Okay, here we go, let's go back to Corinthians.
It's so creepy, isn't it?
It's like we're all of a sudden in some kind
of cultic group or something.
And what happens, so they ate this stuff
and then epinangar ek pneumaticis acutusis pedras.
Wait a minute, what?
The poma is a potion.
They have created a potion, a poma, and they're drinking,
this is Moses, the people of Israel, right?
Who at the time were not really calling people of Israel,
but this migrant group, right?
In the desert, what do they do?
They're drinking potions, they're eating broma,
