The author and the Septuagint
Is able to handle
The translator's not
Give me the next one
And what's going to happen?
I'm God
So I'm going to destroy, right?
This is the monism
This is the third century
Remember we're in the third century
And this is being written
This is the Septuagint, right?
It's being written in Greek
For the first time
And what does he say we're going to destroy?
Of all you people, right?
Who are all in this cult
We're going to destroy your glupta
Your sculptures and your honelta
Your things that are molten
Things that you have to create a cast for
You know what I mean?
Pour the molten metals in there
And you know, there you go
I'm going to break all that shit
Okay, now wait a minute
Wait a minute
Where are we in time?
We're in the third century
You're going to get a hiccup
Because we're going to go back a little bit
We're going to go back in time
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Watch this, people
I, you know, God is saying
Kurio says, look, I'm going to turn away
The hubris of Jacob
And the hubris of Israel, right?
Now, hubris is a very complex
Greek concept
And it's perfectly native right here
It's gorgeous, right?
Fits gorgeously
But there's no way this is a translation
Of the Hebrew
Because the Hebrew, give me the next one
What does he do with their hubris?
And the Hebrew, where is that?
Well, oh, here, that one
Give me the next one
Oh, he turns it into a virtue
Excellency
And of course, the King James translators
Are using the Hebrew
Faked form
It's a forgery
Historically, that's what you call it
The Hebrew forgery
Is producing this
The Lord has turned away
The Excellency of Jacob
Wait, what?
Wait, what?
Excuse me?
Now, if you think for a minute
That any person would translate
Excellency into the Greek word
For hubris, you have no reckoning
Of ancient Greek
Hubris is something that you do
There's a whole science of hubris, by the way
It's like psychology, right?
They have a track
Koros hubris ate
First you get wealth
Then hubris
Some kind of act where you think
You're better than the rest of us
Yeah, and where the God sends you then
What does the universe send you then?
Sends you your downfall
Hitler sends you your downfall
Down with tyrants
Down with tyrants
Do you know why Euripides has the tyrant?
Come out and forbid people from worshiping Bacchus
Yeah, yeah
It's time to go
It's time to go
Give me the next one
Oh, by the way, did I mention the interview?
No
Emily Moyer, please
Satanic congregation
While there's 606 of you
That's nice
It makes me comfortable
Go to Emily Moyer
And I'll put out a link to her podcast
And I just had a delightful conversation
And I think she's one of the most interesting people
That I've met
And I'm compelled by part of the reasoning stuff she was doing
It was mental gymnastics
And she is a gymnast
I think something wore off
Something about the gymnasium
Shall we go wrestle?
I love it
It was a good conversation
She's an incredible person
Let's go to the next one
Since, look, I'm telling you constantly
Please, Satanic congregation
I'm constantly telling you, look
The Greek stuff just is way beyond anything in the area
Right?
I want to actually show you
You're looking at the so-called
Epic of Gilgamesh
Written in that chicken scratch
Listen, I had near-eastern studies with Norman Yaffe
Who knows this chicken scratch inside and out
And Babylonian and Acadian and all the other Adians
Okay?
There was a library
Of this dude named Osher Bonnie Paul
And if you can call it a library
It produced some stuff like this
Like this, and really people
It's mostly list, palace lists and stuff like that
I'll show you because you don't believe me
But I want you to look at it
Satanic congregation, look at that chicken scratch
Oh, my God
The history of humanity is the history of languages
That suck and die
And languages that conquer
It's a survival thing
It's probably in its DNA
Look at that, come on
I was going to read that
Seriously, I would scratch my backside with that
That's what I would do with that if I were
And I know I'm talking like the ancient Greeks did though
But there's a reason, come on man, seriously
You really want to test me?
Okay, fine, fine, let's look at Gilgamesh
Get in here, get in here Gilgamesh
