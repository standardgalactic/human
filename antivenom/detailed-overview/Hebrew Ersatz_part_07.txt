To Nineveh
I'm going to show
Right in front of your face
I'm going to show your opiso
Your opiso
That sounds bad
Give me this one
What is that?
Ta opiso
The hinder parts
There is a strip
We have to be specific
There is a strip
Between your anus
And your genitalia
From sea to shining sea
This is what you get to see
If you're Moses
And God
Stops by
Remember
Remember the
Templars are licking
That area
The newbies get to lick that area
It's in the trials
Right? And it's got
The purple on it
Why is it? Because
When you're applying the purple to your anus
I'm talking about the
Planet
When you're applying that
Drug
Your pants are going to get stained
Your pants are going to get stained
It's so important
That that girdle
That
Aphrodite wears
You know why that has such a sharp sting to it?
It's
Full
Of what comes out
Of her vagina
And do you know what that is?
That's life
It's ionic life
The vagina of the universe
Is what gives us life
Yes, Timmy
Timmy
Develop your language
Perhaps you can describe this in some poetry
Stop hating women
Timmy
Monism is a step backwards
It's a step backwards
Let's keep looking
What else is she? Give me
I've got a couple more
Here, oh God
Just so you can ask for contrast with Inky
Inky do
Ate the food until he was sated
He drank beer
We had the food and the beer before
Seven jugs became expansive
You know, that's
That's an awfully strange translation
You know that doesn't say that
And sang
With joy
He was elated
He splashed his shaggy body
Seriously?
Okay, Tommy
Settle down
Learn how to tell some narrative, Tommy
Give that
Give it to him
What did he do?
He rubbed himself with oil and turned into a human
Tommy, now I told you
When you go to school
Where is it?
Tommy, I told you when you go
You've got to learn the right things
You've got to learn the right things, Tommy
No
No
No, give it to
They love it, don't they?
Jesus Christ, Tommy
Sorry, that was brilliant
Thank you, thank you
Hit it, no, get away from there
Let's go down here
What happens, people?
He says, God says to her
This grace-filled
Prostitute
Who is giving us all health
Salvation is health
What does he say about her?
I'll bring all this pollution
On to you
And all this dirty foulness
And I'm going to make you
A paradigma
I'm going to make you
Look at that word
Bottom line, paradigma
That's where we get paradigm
And this brings up
Our third
Hebrew inadequacy
There is no way
There is no way
That the Hebrew
With its 7,000 basic words
Can express this
You're talking about
Totally different societies
One advanced and one not
It's anthropology
Give me the next one
Watch what happens, people
Did I give them the definition?
Oh, the paradigma, no, I didn't
Check it out sometime
Check it out sometime
And what happens?
Yeah
People, Nineveh
People are going to be like in the future
Who's going to mourn you, baby?
Right? Nobody's going to be there
To help you
Because why?
Because Jehovah is beating up
Nineveh
Right?
Pimp Hashem is beating up
Nineveh
What are you picking on Nineveh for?
It's just two mounds of dirt, bro
And
What?
What?
