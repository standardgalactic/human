He just shrugged
He shrugged it off, what do you want me to do?
Right? Let's ride this thing
It's too bad
We care at Satanic initiation
Because that's not the history
That's not the history
The history is this text is Greek
Originally
Yeah
It's got some things in it
Let's go to the next one
Let's convert
Everybody
It's the lanes are full of
Here's your skillful artisan
So I want you to notice
Okay, we've got a term
Equated with
An artisan who's skillful
Just want you to notice that
You get a taste for where the culture is
Right?
Now where did they get their word?
Craftsman
Okay, so wait a minute
This is a name, it's actually a proper name
Right?
It's not based upon the
Action of a craftsman
Has nothing to do with the history
Of the craftsman, it's a name
Maybe they were a family
Of craftsman
So you can see that
The derivation
Of that word is kind of questionable
Questionable at best
Right?
And you'll find that a lot
In the Hebrew translation of the Septuagint
You'll find that
The more you go
And do your lexical work
You'll find they don't really know what this word means
Right?
And if you only have 8,000
Unique words, that's a huge problem
You mean you got a percentage of those words
That
You know, we think we understand
But yeah, no, it's a bad
It's a bad place to be
So
You know, hey, languages
Just aren't born equal
That's the way it is
Some of them dominated and some of them didn't
Okay, let's go to the next one
Isn't language beautiful though?
Okay, what else are we looking for?
As Jehovah
Is going to be taken out of the world
He's going to be taken
That craftsman
He's going to be taken
That wise craftsman
And he's also going to be taken
The knowing akroaten
What is an akroaten?
Next one, please
What is he going to be taken?
He's going to be taken these away
Now, what is this?
What is this?
It's a person who hears
Are you ready?
This is really native Greek
Right, really native Greek
Yeah
And when I say that, I just have to mention
By the way
There was a language
Discovered in northern
Turkey
That is descendant
From the
Greek
Of Hellenistic Greece
They still speak it
They don't have anything recorded of it
But they still speak it
And what's funny
As I've been telling you
Modern Greek is nothing
Is nothing close
Okay
Don't fool yourself
It's not
I worked with modern Greek
Students in classics
Right
And they would be the first
To tell you
It's a whole different ball game
But this language
They just discovered in northern Turkey
It is
A sister language
To the Hellenistic
Greek
And they gave a couple of examples
Grammatically how it is
And some uses of infinitives
I thought that was nice, elegant
And the funny thing was
In the article they said
And it's jowdely unrelated to modern Greek
Like there's no
No overlap whatsoever
I thought that was
I thought that was
I'm telling
I'm sorry modern Greek
I'm sorry it's a language
But that's what happens when you take
A 14 year old
And put her in a habit
And put her into a prison
And put her out to bloom
That's what happens
Linguistically that's what happens
Okay let's get back on it
Speaking linguistically
Next one let's go
Where these people want their values
Where they said I was going to ruffle some feathers
Look at this what is the word for it
Whispering or charming
Whispering or charming
What is that here
Isn't that really a whisper or a charm
Or go back to the last one
Boom look people
Look at the
Second line in A
A disciple and a pupil
Right?
A disciple or a pupil
And
My goodness look at Roman numeral number two
A reader
Are you kidding me
A reader okay so this is one of the
Things they're going to be taking away
This is not something
That the Hebrew was able to recognize
So the Hebrew used instead
A whispering or a charming
As a noun
Okay
Not the same thing
Definitely not the same thing
Go to the next one
We're starting to degrade here
Now watch it's going to get worse
And I'll hurry up here because I know
We've got ten minutes
My people
My people what
The praktoris
Are
Taking everything from you
The praktoris are taking everything from you
Yes
And what's worse is the
These are the people
Who are ruling you
Says
Isaiah no what are
What's up
Who are praktoris
Let's see
Who are praktoris right
They're officials
Execute a judgment for debt
Okay again
Highly specific word
This is a
Societal position
A civic position if you will
Right somebody
Who's coming to collect the debt
Right looks like
Taxes are also involved
Okay give me the next one
What go back to that one
How does the Hebrew
Handle this
Okay as for
My people
Their oppressors
Are children
Wait is this the same line
Yes it's the same line
And women rule over them
Wait a minute that wasn't any
Of the Greek
What's happening here
There's going to be no word
For this position because there wasn't
That position when
The Hebrew was around
To be able to assimilate it
So they didn't have it
So what do you use
You use something general like oppressor
Oppressor
Well okay
Where are you getting the children
Go back to the Greek verse
Where are they getting the children
My people
Those who control
The retrieval of debts
They're going to be all over you
And who are going to rule over you
The Apitun Tess
Give me the next one
Boom
Yeah
Here we go, what is it to
Apiteo
It's to demand something back
To get something to be
Returned
Okay look at it in the passive
I think this is neat
To be demanded in payment
To be
Demanded in payment
Okay so these are people
Who are the people
Not only are they going to come to collect their debts
Right
That you've got with them
But they are also going to show up and be all mouthy
Yeah
Yeah
Oh my goodness
This is terrible news right
Let's see
I still don't see the Hebrew was way off
What's the Hebrew
People, okay
The mouthy
Are these people
Women
How is the translator
Remember, now the story is
In this letter of Aristias
The yahoo blessed
This event of translating
From the Hebrew to the Greek
So for some reason
When they went from the Hebrew woman
Yeah
Got to an oppressor
Who
Comes and takes away your furniture
While yelling at you
Okay
This is not a good translation
You cannot go
From a lower level
Of technical expertise
Linguistically to a higher
You can't do it
Yeah
You can only reach the equivalent
Or less
And if you don't have
A highly technical language
You aren't going up that ladder
You only have 8000 words
Hebrew
You had your guts beaten out of you
By ancient Greek
Man that dominated the world
Don't worry they even went over
And gave it to those up dwelling Romans
Oh god
You know what Marcus Aurelius
Read, he read Greek
He wrote in Greek
And he was the Roman emperor
Why would he do that?
Because number one he was on drugs
And the drugs were making him smarter
And the creek
Was a necessary component
It was a catalyst that just made the whole reaction
Take off
Yeah
Oh god
It's amazing history
I love it
Nobody wants to see the dirty stuff
You do
My congregation
