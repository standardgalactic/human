That control reproduction
Even those
You put those in there
This is
This is your life's pharmacy kit
That's the Cosmos
It's that order
That order
And so this is what he's going to fight against
He's going to take away your hairdos
He's going to take away your hair nets
And long story short
None of these terms are captured
Give me the next one
It's terrible
The translation gets terrible
And I just want to jump
These are all Athenian too
I want you to realize these are all
Athenian terms
Again, placing the language squarely
Fifth, fourth, third centuries
Good, good, good
Give me that, I'm going to fly
Watch this, these are just things
That are there that it's hard for us to be able to capture
And they have to do
With
This little
Here, I'm going to jump ahead
To, is it this one?
Look at this, did I
Really overdo it or what?
What else is
What else is the Lord?
Here's the punchline, people
What else is the Lord going to take away?
He's going to take away
The Peripurphura
The Peripurphura
Yeah, and what else is the Lord going to take away?
The Lord's going to take away
Ta mesopurphura
Are you kidding?
These are terms
Everybody saw
This is the first term that comes up
In the library, the end of that word
Peripurphura
That's the first word
Of the great Herculaneum library
For the future historians
The great Herculaneum library
The very first word that comes out
Is that purple
Right?
And we've got it here in the text
Not only that, we're going to tax something else
On the front of the mezzo
The mesopurphura
Tell me, what does the Hebrew
Translate those as?
Blow it up
What does the Hebrew translate those as?
The rings
And the jewels with the word nose
Tagged on it
The rings and the nose jewels
Are you
Kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Do you see what happened there?
That's a guess, bro
Whoever made that translation
Was downright guessing
Now here's the problem
The Greek actually matches
With the whole context
Because he's attacking these women
Who are priestesses
And he's attacking their validity
And he's going to take away all
Of their wardrobe
Yeah
Yeah
Nice
Gorgeous
And that purple is part of it
You know what those purple words are?
They're different terms
For using
That
Gorgeous material
Staying with the purple
Oh god
He's going to take that away
But no
The Hebrew comes along and says
No, you must be rings and nose jewels
Because everybody knows
You need the rings and the nose jewels
Yeah
Why did they do that?
I'll never know
That's a mystery of our history
Right there
They didn't want the purple
They wanted jewels
Okay
So you can see people that
The story, the narrative of
This being translated
Into Greek from the Hebrew
Is completely made up
You would have to be completely
Transformed
And just inventing things to make
I don't know the story better
Wow
Wow
Okay, let's go
I'm going to pull one out
This is the last one, Neil
And I'm coming
Are you ready for this?
This is
Boom, I was going to take you all through the purple
But instead I'm going to end with this one
Nope
There we are
Take down the initiating people
I love this
Are you ready?
Look at the verse 22
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that gorgeous?
You see that word before
The letter
For the end of the verse
Capital lambda
On the front of it
Those of you who recognize
The Greek now will see that that's
Laconian
It says that
Curios is going to take from you
Those things
We're talking about their wardrobe
Those things that you put on
It's your home
And your privacy
And what are those things
One of them is a Laconian
See-through
A diaphanous
Laconian
Nightgown
And that's what Curios
Is going to take
From you
You mean in the Bible it refers to the
Spartans?
Yeah
It does
It's being written in the third century
Right?
There's nothing novel about the Laconians
Then
Yeah
Wow
Why is Isaiah
Who supposedly is way back
Why is centuries earlier
Why is he writing about the Laconians?
That's interesting
Let's see what the Hebrew does with it
Because now this is a problem
This is a problem
This is not only a linguistic problem
Because you can't represent that in Hebrew
But it looks bad
Culturally
A lot of the changes that are made
From the original Greek and the Septuagint
To the Hebrew
Have to do with control
Of content
That's what people
Always want when they
Rewrite
They want control of content
And you guys know how it works
With the worship of the muse
Nobody controls content
You don't make your soup here
This is a pure stream
You're all gone
Yeah
Oh God
Love that
What does the Hebrew do with the Laconian?
Let's just show this because I know Neil's going to love this
Open it up
Okay what
The festival apparel
And the mantles
And the purses
Wait what were we looking for
There was something big there
There was Laconians
There's Spartans
Where the Spartans go
They cut out the Spartans
They cut out the Spartans
Okay now what they would have
You believe
Is that
You
Don't have Spartans
But the translation
Does
Because God
Is
Perfect
Yeah
I don't know
Looks like God could have gotten better linguists
To be honest
That's
Terrible
You guys blow it
Those I'm talking
You know what I'm talking to
The youth balls
Who started to
Came up with the idea
Of writing this fake letter
Of Aristaeus and saying
Look
This great person
Asked the king and the king
Was like yes I need a translation
Yes no
They didn't care
No the person
Who came up with that load
The load of the history of the Septuagint
What that did
Was that load compelled
Christianity forward
It established a legitimacy
That was strong enough
To dissolve
Classical wisdom
Yeah it's like
Some kind of acid
Ate right through it
Yeah
What you're watching is the
Monad
Take out
Because that's what it does
That's what monotheism does
It doesn't matter what color
Taste or variety it is
Monotheism
Kills
Classical civilization
The civilization that
Brought you democracy
And the scientific method
That civilization
Christianity
Islam
And that stuff they worshiped
Around Akhenaten
That stuff kills
Classical wisdom
Yes it does
It does
So
When the library start getting burned
That's when you know your temperature
Is too high
And your proportion of radicals
Is way too high
Right
It's like a 50 years
Just to bring in just the present for a second
Every 150 years says
Tom
Someone is going to try to
Pull down the government
The established government
Yeah
Yeah
And who is it
Typically
I had somebody ask me this week
Can't you combine Christianity
To include everyone
Christianity and the Abrahamic faiths
Can't you combine those
To welcome them
Julian
Who we now call Julian the Apostate
Julian
The last pagan emperor
Said
They're going to do it again
