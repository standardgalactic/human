And then it's okay
Has anyone else corroborated this evidence?
Alien talks about this too
This is another Roman writer
He's writing in Greek as you can see
The Egyptians assert
That they are far from convincing me
They assert that I say
In the days of the far famed Bacchorus
8 feet and 2 tails
And that it spoke
They said that the lamb had 2 heads and 4 horns
What?
So, wait a minute
Now we're looking at
Where does all this
All these prophecies of all these animals
With multiple heads and horns
Telling the people
They're going to be sacked and taken over
By the Babylonians and Assyrians
Well, here's another
Source for that
But here's the problem with this
King Bacchorus
As I've shown you
King Bacchorus
Is only in the 8th century BC
This is not
Bronze age
18th dynasty that we're talking about
This is
We're almost in the classical period
We're getting towards
The Persian period now
We're getting towards the Greek Hellenistic
Period
So, this is who this king is
Alright, let's continue
Let's see what else we got
So
I want to go to Herodotus real quick
I want to talk about the alphabet for a second
Herodotus says
That
This is the
The Phoenicians
So, okay
Herodotus
Herodotus mentions in his
Persian Wars
That the alphabet
Comes from the Phoenicians
But
He says something interesting about it
I don't even think I have the source here
I'm on the wrong page
I can look it up
The alphabet
Here it is
He says
The Phoenicians who came
With Cadmus
By the way, Cadmus
Was the king of thieves
He is a Phoenician by descent
But he's living up in thieves in Greece
And it says
At their settlement in this country
Among many others of learning
Brought into Hellas the alphabet
Which had hitherto been unknown
As I think to the Greeks
Only as the time went on
In the form of the letters changed
At this time, the Greeks that dwelt
Around them from most parts were Ionians
Who had been taught
The letters by the Phoenicians
And used them with some few changes in form
I'm not going to show you some crazy shit right here
Ready?
Thus the Ionians
Have from ancient times
Called papyrus sheets skins
But formally, lack papyrus
They used the skins of sheep goats
Ah, Lucy, where's the part that I want?
Here it is. I myself have seen
Cadmian characters
In the temple
Of Ispian
Apollo
So he's saying that the oldest alphabet
That ever existed
Is up in
The temple of Apollo in Boetia
Which is near Athens
Graven on a certain tripods
And for the most part
Like the Ionian characters
That's really strange
Now this
Because the idea of
Phoenicians
Making an alphabet
And then giving it to the Greeks
It's not as black and white as people think it is
There's more going on here
And Herodotus kind of gives a little clue on this
So let's look at this
Alright, I want to show you guys something
This is going to be cool, I promise
I'm going to share a different screen for a second
This right here
Here we go
What I'm about to show you
Is called
It is called the
Dispillow Tablet
Do you see this?
This is an
Ancient Tablet
It's a mystery right now
It was discovered like 30 years ago
In Macedonia
Which is where the Pulaskians used to live
Thrace, Macedonia
Thessaly
That's Pulaskian land
And also Turkey
Where Troy is
Modern-day Turkey
That's where the Pulaskians are from
That whole region
That's the Pulaskians
So right in the heart of the Pulaskian land
Is this
Thing that they discovered
It's like, what the fuck, what is this
Now if you look, that looks like an Eta
That looks like a dollad down there
Looks like you got
Now this one blew my mind
Because this looks like it could be either a
Digama
Which is an ancient form of a
Of a W sound
But it also looks like an Omega
Which is the, oh
It looks like, you can see
Like, all I'm saying is
Looking at these characters
You can almost imagine
An older descendant
Of
What becomes both the Greek
And Phoenician alphabets
Alright, let's continue on this
How much evidence do I have
Right, let's, what do we got here
So I'm going to share my screen
Again, and this time
I'm going to share
Well, I'll just go to the same
Let's go to this page again
Alright, share my screen
Alright, so this
Let's look into this
Tablet, what is this thing
This is what the
Alright
We'll get him back here
Just a second
I hate when that happens
You click on something and it gives you the wrong screen
I hate when that happens
Here we go, I brought it back up
Alright, so
Let's go to, alright, now this time
I shouldn't do that again
So I want to look into this now
This is what the article says
Apparently, now there's been no academic
Articles written on this tablet yet
It's a mystery
People are starting to figure out
What the hell is this thing
Because this is going to, if this really is
Alright, let's just talk about it first
Apparently, this wooden tablet
Bearing what looks like an early form
Of an alphabet, carbon dates
They did carbon dating on it
Because it's wood, so they can carbon date it
5,000 BC
Alright, that doesn't necessarily mean
The writing is 5,000 BC
Someone couldn't have scripted it
But so far, that's all we know
The carbon dating came back
It's from 5,000 BC
It's discovered in 1923
But here's the
Crazy part
This is why I wanted to bring this up
This is the crazy shit right here
It's discovered
The place they found it in
Was a Neolithic village
Which means
Wrap your head around this
You have to understand
What I'm saying here
The village that they uncovered
Very, very far underground
Is all Neolithic stuff
The pottery, the town
The building
And then this is there
How did that get there
And it's carbon dating, matches too
It fits
With the Neolithic
Except for the writing on it
What the fuck is going on
Why is there...
It looks like a Greek
Form of alphabet
In a Neolithic foundation
Put that screen up if you don't mind
I just want to show
So
Okay
The tablets discovered at a symposium
In February 1984
At the University of Thessalonica
The site's paleo environment
Bought new fishing techniques
Tools and ceramics were described
Informally in the met
That's something
So basically
All we know so far
Is they dug up this Neolithic
Place
This is work being done
By Aristotle's University at Thessalonica
Right now
Apparently I looked into it
There's articles being
Academic articles being written on this thing
That might change the
Consensus on the alphabet
I'm not kidding, look this up yourself
Please look this up, don't listen to me
But there are people saying
That the articles being
Written about this tablet
Is going to change the academic consensus
On the invention of the alphabet
Now let me continue with this
I want to show
Because the first question should be
Does the evidence
Is there any other evidence
For anything like this? Is this just
By itself?
I'm going to give you an example
Of something that's
By itself that doesn't fit
The Merneptis deli
Doesn't fit at all with any of the evidence
But it's accepted because
There's a dogma in mainstream academia
That wants
Israel to be like real
They want the fairy tale to be real
Hold that thought, put a little side note on that
Let's go, but here's the thing
It turns out that there actually is
And
Another asteroid
Sorry about that, this is getting exciting man
I'm about to lose it, look
I did a song and dance
You're on, go
Here we go
Here's what's called the
Trojan script
So it turns out there actually is
Some other
Basis of what this means
The Trojan script
Is
Look at this
Obviously it's not Greek
But you look at it
You look at the characters
You don't have to use your imagination too hard
Okay, there's some
It's not like hieroglyphics
It's very syllabic
It's very
You know, okay, so let's talk about this
What's going on here
Philologous, I think that's the same
As
Philologist probably
Attempted to transliterate the signs as Greek
