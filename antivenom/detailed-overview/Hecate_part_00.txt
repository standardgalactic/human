Blasphemy
I'm flying for peace, all things hidden will be revealed
I'm Freddy Kruger with the purple stone, Hail Satan!
My deus is home, I'm in the twilight zoning
Roots I cut and grow em'
Diff up all you token, take two hits and hold it
The witch she keep you loaded, so good they want my mow it
I spit dragon venom through hell and through the heavens
High fire is purple, I'm with the ashy ashen
Where the horses ride, flying through the night
I'm here for the promises, you feel alright
It's a policy, she keeps it tight
Got the costume on, all night
I'm with the fumigation company
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
All of us who have lost companions on this route
Yeah, tonight we're going to be talking about Hackety
We're going to be talking about Hackety and her hound
Her wolf, her black gorgeous beautiful wolf
A shout out to all those who mourn
Given that, what do I want to do tonight?
I'm going to give you a warning before we start
Because this is the most radioactive blasphemy in existence
This is stuff that will burn through the quantum reality
Are you ready?
Nobody has ever, ever, ever translated this
Nobody has ever translated this
And you are getting it exclusively
Exclusively, tonight you've got to take it
To see something that nobody
Nobody has seen
Now, what is it we're going to see?
It is the deepest, most radioactive blasphemy
Oh my god, I can't wait
Oh god, you know, this is fresh
This is fresh off the muse
And I am telling you, we're going to bring up a ghost tonight
Where's that whip?
We're going to bring up a ghost tonight
We're going to work that ghost out
And we are going to look at something
That is going to make you all sick to the stomach
Oh, Christing
You wanted to see what Christing was
Let's look at what Christing is
Here we come
Where is he? Come here, Galen
Come here, get over here
You love it, you love it
Come here, this is, show us, show us
Blast them, blast everybody
Blow them off the page, go
Look at people, look at what I'm talking about tonight
I'm talking 1826
This thing is out, it's published in 1826
When John Quincy Adams was president of the United States
Oh, what a year
This is volume 12 of all the works of Galen
Nobody has touched this thing
This is right in the middle of the pristine well of life
That is the collected works of Galen
It's right in the middle of it
It's just hiding there
And what this is, I'm going to show you
Let's pull it out, Galen, tell me, Galen
What you want to talk about tonight
Look at this people
This is his work on the simple drugs
Their balances and their capacities
Okay, we're talking about simple drugs
Right, I told you
I'm going to show you the Christ
Like you've never seen it
And this has never been opened before today
Give it to me, this is fresh
This is fresh stuff
Oh, God, I'm going to just go through
Look, people, I'm going to translate it
But I'm going to warn you again
This is rough
Are you ready?
So, what does Galen say?
Chewie, can we readjust here?
We readjust the console here to get us going
Okay, look people, he says
I've been talking about some things that they do
With some bodily fluids, yeah
But these things aren't really forbidden
They don't really have a pollution value
Right, but now what I'm going to talk about
Because I talked about that before
Now what I'm going to talk about is plenty that
Are you ready?
This is Galen, he says, hey
This drink of sweat and the drink of urine
And the drink of the woman's menstrual flow
These things are esselge
And loathsome
Give me a hope, right?
That's what the word means
I'm just translating the word for it
Makes you loathsome
The drinking of it
Wait a minute
Galen, are you talking?
Are you talking about?
Okay, let's let him go on
People don't interrupt Galen, right?
And what's he say?
The worst one of all of these is the copros
What's the copros?
That is translated as feces
The feces which they Christ themselves with
Around the mouth and down the throat
Xenocrity says it gets in the stomach
And it causes certain problems
Christing, we're going to look at it
I'm going to show it to you in just a minute
And it results in the copros
The poopy getting around your mouth
And down into your throat
Remember, he's just been telling us
About body fluids
He's going to go on and on and on
About blood and about bile
He's talking now about poop
And Christing yourself with poop
How do you get Christed with poop?
You didn't know that Christ had something to do
With the application of feces to your mouth
And throat, did you?
How do you think they got it there?
Are you ready?
I'm told you tonight, people
I told you tonight
All the gloves are off
This is dedicated to my companion
And she was such fierce German shepherd
She wouldn't stop for anything
To do what was right
I know it's extremely, extremely uncomfortable
To look at the actual evidence that we have
When you get in that ship and you go back in time
And you're sitting there
Watching them do these things
It's difficult
Please, those of you who have not
Been part of the congregation for long
Realize your nausea medicine will kick in shortly
Fantastic, fantastic
Let's go for it
I'm going to keep translating it
Go back, I've got to keep translating it
Okay, Galen, give me some more, buddy
Give me some more, Galen
Oh, I love this, are you ready?
So he says, look, you know, I can't
