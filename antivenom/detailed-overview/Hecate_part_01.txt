Xenocrates wrote about it, you know what I mean
And he wrote about what it does
He even wrote about drinking earwax
Drinking earwax
Right, I told you these people are into a lot of things
Now, did you know they drank earwax?
It's a medicine, people
What else did he write about?
He said, Galen said, I don't know
He said, I don't know, man
If I'm going to recommend it
Right, because, you know, for any kind of disease
But, you know, there's very much one, I think
That's the worst of all of them
These body fluid medicines that they're using
And that's the poop
Galen, he's got something against poop, right?
And he says, look, it's the greatest
It's the greatest hardship or trouble-causer
For people who understand, for people who know
Right, we know about the coprophagia
We know about eating poop
We know about the ischla-urgon
We know about doing the sexual acts
That we're not going to talk about
And being the canitis
We know about the canitis
We know what the canitis does
The canitis, remember in Greek, is the one
Who presents his buttocks in a dance
Okay, Galen is saying, we know
Everything that's going on, right?
But this thing is rather bad, you know what I mean?
But, despite that, there's one even worse
It's those people
Who are doing the lesbian thing
While they are doing the Phoenician thing
Wait, let me get this straight
And this is right here, I'll just read it
Two spoiny kids on taston, lesbian, zonton
Right, those people
The worst thing is, the medically, the worst thing is
Is the people who are doing the Phoenician
From the group that does the lesbian thing
Yeah, we'll take a look at some of these words
Okay, Galen, thank you very much
And what happens, he says, look, there appears to me even
Some advantage for the one who drinks menstrual fluid
Right?
Okay, then he goes into a little discussion
Of trying it and stuff like that
Look, the very last two lines in the bottom
They say, but look, there's one
There's one that is just friggin' gross
And that's when people do what
When they Christ parts of their body
With poop
Galen, what kind of parties are you hanging out at?
Well, that's not as bad, right?
I can understand even the eating of the semen
Says Galen, the male seed
I can understand that
It's the one where we Christ with poop
That really bothers me
Wait, I'm going to finish up here
With the cannon, the nuclear weapon
Are you ready? It's about to detonate
Hit the next one, yeah
Okay, people, hold on, right?
So this other guy's anocrates
He's writing about these things, right?
He's differentiating very carefully
Between the penis that is Christed
And its advantages between that one
Because that's what you're going to get
On your mouth and on your throat
He's distinguishing between that one
And the one that you have in intercourse
Between male and female
When the penis slips out from the colpus
What is it covered with?
Right?
So this is all Christing
If you'll just look, we'll look at the Christing terms
Look at the third line down
Catachryomonos, right?
What is he talking about that's being Christed?
He's talking about somebody's private part
Which they gonos, right?
Let's just say that, you're gonos
Look, I'm teaching you, great
You're gonos has been Christed
And the stuff that's on there
Is going to end up on your stomach
And in your pharls
So here's the advantages and disadvantages
And here's the antidotes to clear that stuff up
Give me the next one
Because it's different, right?
It's different
Last one here, go hit it
There it is, blow it up
Here we go, all right, Galen, give me one more
Just give me one more goodie, right?
Give me one more goodie
Look, he says, Galen, you know
Urine that you drink has a certain power
You know what I mean?
And, yeah
And you can drink it
And you can be Christed with it, right?
You can Christ it all over the parts of your mouth
You can use poop too
Okay, are you ready?
Are you ready?
So when Jesus Christ is around
The word Christ means something
And I am showing you what it means
Give me the next one, give me the next one
Oh, yes, no
Oh, it's so heavy
It's so heavy tonight, these taxes are heavy
People, just hold on with me
Oh, Lord Jesus Christ, please
Please hang around with us for as long as you can
As long as we can stomach
Hit us with the next one, that's all I can take
Get him off there
Okay, look what we're talking about people
Poesis de hidrotos
A drink of your sweat
The sweat is also the stuff that's all over your body
Right?
When you take a sweat bath, you know what I mean?
You get all that and you're like, what is this stuff?
You can bottle that stuff, right?
We're talking about the effects of it
And he's like, this is what you use it for
Hit me the next one
What else?
We're talking about the drink of uru
Your urine
Okay, I just want you to know
They're drinking urine, the same people who were
Putting poop on their bodies
Come on, grow up
Anthropologically people, come on
Look at what they're doing, they're using the urine
Give me the next one
What else?
What else?
The catameniu of the gunaykos
Right?
The monthly running
The monthly running and I'll show you what they thought
The monthly running was
Remember, this is a world that respects science
Who else in the world do you think has such an art
Dedicated to physiology at the time?
Nobody?
