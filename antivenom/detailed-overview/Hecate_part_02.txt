Why?
Because you need language
Your history is not you
It's your language developing
You're just a friggin ant
Yeah, love it, love it
Give me the next one
What else are we talking about?
This says the one who drinks the menses
This is a specific person
A menses drinker
A menses drinker
Now remember, that's not necessarily a bad thing
Physiologically
Right?
Okay, let's see what the next one is
According to Galen, you be quiet
Give me the next one
What is that?
What is that catamenion?
Look at these people
It's your monthly wages
You earned it
Catharsis
It's what?
It's your catharsis
And then they put hyma
It's the blood
Look at number two
What is it that we're drinking?
Look at number two at the bottom
The menses of women
Right?
It's just from the concept of the monthly thing
The monthly activity
The moon's influence
Love it, 28 days
You gotta love that
The science is so
It's like a bunch of nerds
Got together, made democracy
Give me the next one
What is that catharsis then
That women undergo?
It's a purification
It's a clarification
Look at number two
Medically, what is it?
It's the clearing off of morbid humors
An evacuation, whether natural
Or by the use of drugs
And are they using drugs?
To regulate their menstruation?
Yes, it turns out
You're supposed to
Isn't that funny?
Isn't that funny?
There's a whole world of plant and animal products
Out there that will tune you up
Yeah, maximize your greatness
Ooh, I love that
Turn you into a vampire man
Nobody will stop you
Nobody will stop you
We gotta read those texts too
Up and down, the flow
Dialing in and out
That's why they're going out at midnight
They all get naked and oiled up
And they go out at midnight
Just like those boys
Who are being initiated by the Christian church
In the catechesis
Performance of the catechesis
That's, they end up
Naked, stripped, and oiled
The priest oiled them
And they tell the children, do not be afraid
Christ himself was naked on the cross
Yes
Okay
Did they understand?
Did the church understand what Jesus was doing?
You better believe it
Or Origen wouldn't have had to cut off his testicles
Did you know that?
There's a Christian hero who cut off his own testicles
When everybody else was getting arrested
For, oh, I can't say that word on YouTube
For doing things, children
Yeah, check it out, early church history
It's pretty disgusting
Let's keep going, let's keep going
Oh, I can feel Safi, this feels good, I like this
What else are we talking about?
You gotta realize we're talking about something
That's Beloura, right?
So Galen is talking in terms of those things
That are impure, those things that are unpurged
Those things that are abominable, right?
That cause the reaction to step back, right?
Okay, fantastic, give me the next one
Give me the next one, why is this all important?
Because do you remember
In this tiny, tiny, tiny message to you
Do you remember the musterion, the mystery?
It's all about Babylon, the great
She's the mother of those prostitutes
And of their bedelug maton
The earth's pollution
The thing that we're talking about
That is what is in her cup
Okay, if you just fell to profound connection
To the nature that is these plants and animal substances
And the moon cycle
If you just felt that, that is what
Christianity, Judaism, Islam
It's what they close, it's an oculus
That they close off
So that you don't have a connection with her
And who's the she that I'm talking about?
I'm talking about Hecate
I'm talking about she who makes magic
I love it, I love it, absolutely love it
Let's go back, we gotta go back into the Christ thing
Just a little bit more, I just want to keep showing you
Because people, you know how it is
What's gonna happen?
Lady Babylon, look at the second line
She has a cup that's gold
And in this cup, whether she holds in her hand
Is the bedelug maton
Caeta acacarta
Teis porneas
It is the pollution
That which is unclean, which is in her cup
It's the uncleanness of her pornea
That pornea is a sexual activity
The cup that gives you ionic life
Is her pornea
You mean Jesus in the mouth and throat
You mean all of that?
I could have done the other one
Who told us to come here?
Ryan, who told us?
I told you people, never go to a monist
Paradise, never go to a religious monist
Anything, I don't care if it's an ice cream social
Shame on you, congregation
Satan, that's one for you
That's one for you, everybody
I hope you felt that
Let's get back in line
Get back in shape here
She's got that cup, right?
What's happening now?
Okay, I'm sorry to spring this on
You say, Tenant congregation, I'm sorry to spring this on
I should have told you I was going to do this beforehand
But I brought you something tonight
