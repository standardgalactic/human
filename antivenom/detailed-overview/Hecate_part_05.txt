So they would look at you funny
You know, for not knowing it
Right?
With the
With the ocular Christing
Here she is
Right?
That archeress
Who's so devastating
To the civilized world
Because she can gallop
Shoot backwards while she's galloping
It's terrible poison that they've got
Look at her
She is rocked on that stuff
Right?
So by the time Galen's right
This is old, so don't be surprised
Like, look, if you've been Christing
If you've been Christing in your mouth
Um, this is the
This is what you're going to have to consider
Right?
It's just being a good doctor
For the things that are being done in society
If you were Christing in the mouth now
Right?
Ah
You know, they were given different advice
Right?
But the Christing is there
Right?
The Christing is the application
Are you telling me
Christ is the application of a drug?
Yes
And in this case
It's the application of a drug
That is mixed with feces
From you having performed activities
On a canitis
In the dance of your religion
Yeah
Let's go to the next one
Let's go to the next one
People are still like
Oh, God, I don't know
Which way is up?
What about this doing this Phoenician thing?
Right?
What about doing this Phoenician thing?
Well, there's something called a schulach
This is from
This is the ancient lexicon
We're looking at now
The schulach
Most people translate this as dog or puppy
And it's generally puppy
He says the schulachs is a type of aphrodisiac
Just like that
Which is used by the Phoenicians
Now, he doesn't say the Phoenicians here
He says by those who are doing the Phoenician thing
Like the dogs, the Heracles
Yes
Yes, believe it or not
Believe it or not
Christ me, baby
Right?
Right?
Okay, let's see
Let's see where this goes
Let's see where it goes
Hit me with the next one
I want to give to you
I want to give to you
We just had puppy
Look at the second to the last line
The second word is schulakitin
Schulakitin
Remember, everybody in Greek
You're practicing
Right, you can say it after me
And they had an excellent session
Lab yesterday was good
It was good
Thank you, everybody who showed up
And all the TAs that are working
Remember, you can avail yourself of that
Every Saturday at 12 central
You can go there, right?
And ask questions
Love it
Oh, God, it's good
Have a good time
Look, people
Let me bring us to the origin
Of everything that we've been talking about
All of this magic
Look at the connection here
With the schulakitin
This is what you call
Hecate
This is what you call her
She's that one who is associated
With that aphrodisiac
I thought it was puppies
Yes, and that's why your
That's why your Patreon blows
Right, because your evidence is garbage
Because you don't read the text
Who are we talking about
When we're talking about Hecate
Let me just read this to you
Let me just translate it to you
Right, I call upon Hecate of the way
She whose way is divided into three parts
The desired one
The Uranian one
The Cthonian one
And the one who comes from the sea
She wears that peplos
That is crocus colored
She wears it
She's the one who hangs around in the tombs
She's the one who becomes metabolic
Do you know anybody like this?
She becomes metabolic
With the souls of the dead
Have you ever known someone
You can read around for images
Have you ever known someone
Who has brought you to the place
Where you are metabolic
With the dead
Have you ever been there?
I'm asking you seriously, Satanic congregation
Have you ever danced with the dead?
Have you ever?
Well, they did
And she is the one who leads that dance
Do you understand?
Do you have ears to hear?
She's the one who leads that dance
This mystery is ancient religion
This thing birthed Judaism Christianity
It birthed them
Right?
She is the one behind the cup
Fantastic
Now you know why they called the Medwa
The one who knew all the drugs
They said she was the daughter of Hecate
The daughter of Hecate
Let that sink in
Let it sink in for a minute
And you begin to understand
Remember, think of it anthropologically
Let it sink in
Love it
