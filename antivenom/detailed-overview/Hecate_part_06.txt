Oh, God
Give me the hymn again
And what else is she?
Look, she's got power in all three realms
The weird thing about Hecate
Is that the Zeus said, hey
She has to have total power in all three realms
She has to control what's here
What's up and what's down
She has to control the air, the earth, and the water
Right?
She has to possess all of those realms
Right?
Now you know why she can get
Bacchic with the dead
Right?
Okay, what else does she love?
She's the daughter of Persees
And she loves the void
Have you been into the void, Satanic congregation?
Have you been there?
Do you have the star in your hand?
Have you jumped into that void?
She is the guide in the void
Yeah, isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute
I know that when you go into the void
In antiquity, the edamon
When you go into it
That you're meeting the devil
You're meeting Satan
Didn't you think this was Saturnian?
Did you think you were getting anywhere out of the garden?
Did you think seriously?
Yeah, that's her
Okay
Okay, right
Are they picking it up?
Yeah, I think they're getting it
And we're ready to transmit
Beautiful
Okay, here we go, people
What else is she?
She is that one who is of the night
She is the one who is of that aphrodisiac
That we use when we foiniquizo
Okay
She is that inescapable bossy layer
She is the one who makes that aphariac rumble
You know the thunder that you get out of the cup?
Can you imagine getting thunder out of a cup?
Oh, you say, oh, that's silly
You haven't had the cup
Yeah, she's the one who brings it
Give me the next one
What else is hacka-tina?
If you go wikipedia hacka-tina
You're going to find the biggest bunch of
Well, it may have good stuff on there
See if they talk about sources
But if you want to go out there and search for hacka-tina
You're going to find the most ridiculous
Take off the goth stuff
Come on
What a ridiculous
She's also the daoropoulon
Now, people will translate that as bullherder
Bullherder, well, that makes sense
She dances with ghosts and she herds bulls
Remember what that Tauros is
I taught you last time
That Tauros is that genitalia
She's the one who masters that bull
Okay, and she's a nymph
She's a nymph, yes, and she's a leader
And she's a nourisher of the children
Because you know what the one law is
That none of us ever, ever question
You know what that one...
Oh, I didn't tell you guys that
The one thing the universe never questions
Is the value of nourishing children
She is the child nourisher
If you cannot stand before she who nourishes children
If you can't stand before her because of who you are
Or what you've done
You got no place
You got no place with us
All right
Do you see where Jesus took a little tiny step over the line
He just took a little tiny step
Oh, God, you're going to scandalize me
You're going to scandalize me
Oh, stop, you're going to scandalize me
Shut up, Jesus
Continue Christing that kid, you freak
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
And so what happens?
She's a child nourisher
You know what I mean?
We pray to her as the Korah
All of us who have been initiated
That's all part of the deal
Give me the next one
Now, Hezekius, when you pull him up and say,
Hey, Hezekius, tell us
What is the Hekate anyway?
What is that Hekate anyway?
He says it's a Xulon
A Xulon is a steak
It can't be just a piece of wood
But here it's a piece of wood
That they tie or bind
Somebody who's guilty
Who's done bad things
They tie him to it
And then they beat him
Do you like that?
So what is the Hekate?
The Hekate is what you get with justice, baby
That's what you get
You do something bad to a kid
We're going to tie you to a steak
And we're going to beat you
We're going to beat you and whip you
Oh, wow
That's fantastic
Doesn't that now, people, come on
Can't you feel good about that?
That is satanic justice, baby
You don't get that kind of justice
From any other kingdom
That belongs to Satan, baby, right there
Oh, God
Don't you love that?
Who wants to go?
I want to go
Is that part of the cult?
After the vision thing?
Do we all get to beat up freaks?
Yeah, you know
Let's go for it, baby
I love it
Oh, give me the next one
Give me the next one
We're done
And next one
Boom
Now, Hekate, they'll tell you is also the throwing
No, let's forget you
It's the throwing
Henry Cavill still loves you
It's the throwing of the javelin
Or the hurling of a bolt of some sort
Like an arrow
What do you call Hekate?
They call Artemis Hekate
Why?
