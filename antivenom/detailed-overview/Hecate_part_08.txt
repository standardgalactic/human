I'm the light of the world
Watch
You know where he's stealing that from
You coprophagic
Next one
Who is the Hecatech?
Here's a little section that
Medea is talking about
Who Hecatech is to her
And she says she lives within her inner chamber
In the very most sacred nooks
Of her inner chamber
Ladies, listen to me
The great queen says
In the depths of her inner chamber
Dwells Hecatech
I suspect you'll understand that
I suspect you will
There's something earthy in that
She's that power
And who does Medea go to
For that power?
As a matter of fact, who is Medea?
What is her title?
She is a priestess of Hecatech
She comes right out of your hearth, people
Right out of a woman's hearth
Comes Hecatech
Mmm
Mmm
Okay, go, give it to me
Next one
Mmm, right out of her hearth
Love it
And by the way, you know, Pausanias is going to tell us here
You know, the people from Ijina
Remember Paul from Ijina, the physician we dealt with
Love it?
The people from his hometown, his island
What do they do?
They worship Hecatech, right?
And they initiate people
They create the initiates, right?
Once a year, they have this festival
And Orpheus, he says
Orpheus brought this worship to Thrace
Right?
Calling it the mystery, right?
Calling it that initiation, keep going
Right?
So we're right in the middle
When you look at the models that Jesus Christ used
Who is the light of the world
Hail Satan
Who is the morning star
Right?
Look at what, look at what Hecatech produces
Hecatech produces
A phasmacy
Hecatech voice
What do they do?
What does she produce?
She produces images
Right?
Images, ghosts that are full of light
Hecatech, light, ghosts
Hecatech, light, phantasmagoria
Okay?
Everything that the church based its images
Of the whole and the light
And the hail
Is an attempt to reproduce Hecatech
Light
Making image
Love this stuff, love this stuff
You didn't know it was magic, did you?
Of course it's magic
Where do you think, how do you think
You can actually generate this stuff
If you're not on the aphrodisiacs
Go
Give me the next one
We're almost finished there
Here's, oh God
I just want to show you what you feel
Aphrodite is the last two words
The first line
What is the smile or laughter
Loving Aphrodite?
What does she say?
She's like, look
I don't see any problem with what you're saying
You know who you are baby
You are the one
Who guards that bed
Of the highest God
Yeah
You are the one that guards the bed
Of that highest God
Isn't that gorgeous?
Talking about Eila
Think about that for a minute
What are you going to use
In the process?
You're going to use some to guard that bed
You're going to use something that is
Of the air
Of the earth
And of the water
You're going to have drugs
Do you want to know what the yonks is?
It's a drug to bring back
Someone who no longer desires you
You mean you can drug someone
Into desiring you?
Yes
And they're doing it all the time
They're doing it all the time
Good, give me the next one
We're coming close to the finish
These are the things I wanted you to see
That they're dying
They're dying those straps and thongs
Rains
They say
Good, good, good
That's what they're dying
This is not a big deal
But here's what you yell
When you're in the middle of the process
The alalatos is that loud shouting
It's a cry of victory
It's the hallelujah
Of the person who enters
Into the hecatic image
It is the shout
Of the person within the hecatic image
Give me the next one
What are we talking about people?
We're talking about a Christ
Who is staining
Parts of the mouth and throat
We're talking about a right
That involves drugs
That involves sex
That involves enlightenment
That involves opening the mind
And how that right changes
And is contorted, is changed
And everybody in here
I get tons of communications
Hey, Mom, what are you doing?
Both comments and people talking
On another channel or something
People talking about this
I have no, okay
I understand that Jesus is corrupting the right
I understand that
He is not acting as a curotrophos
I get that
