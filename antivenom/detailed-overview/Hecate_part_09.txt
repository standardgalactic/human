But he is achieving the same outcome
Does that justify us for the first try?
Look, people, you know what it sounds like?
It sounds like you're being theological
And I've got no interest in that
I don't care
I don't care what the ramifications are
We don't care
All we want is what they were doing
We want the evidence
We want to protect those sources
And we want that evidence
That's all we want
It's gonna lie like it's gonna lie
And if you're scared
Because of the implications, just
Just wait
For the evidence
It'll surface and you will love it
And that's why people
I feel like I can go to bed at night
Without worrying that I haven't
Ripped off 900 people
That I haven't taken anything from them
Or caused them to buy anything
Notice you have never had to purchase anything
With the exception of those of you who have bought
The Greek textbook, but that's not mine
Right?
And a lot of you are pirating
Right?
Shh, don't tell anyone
Oh, God, the publishers will be knocking at the door
Hey, what is this?
People keep pirating your book
The muse, the chemical muse
Good, good
That's what I say
I go out there and give them a piece in my mind
Give me the next one
No, that's the next one
That's what the poopy
He's covering with the poopies
Hit me with the next one
Boom, and that's the bell
We don't need that
Give me the one under that
The final one
I just want to leave you off with this
There's a dude named Oyneas
Yeah, yeah
And he gave that
Zostera
That girdle, that belt
That was shining
With the purple
Big deal
I can buy a purple belt at Walmart
Right?
Okay
Has much greater meaning
To the people who are wrapped up in the culture
And who are performing these actions
When you see Galen talking about people doing things
Like Christing somebody's mouth
And throat with poop
You have to put yourself in the shoes
Of that civilization
You have to respect
At least respect the process
If you don't understand what they're using it
Or what it's for
Because that's not what we're here to do
We're not here to say
Oh, this is terrible
I mean, you can
Feel free
It makes me a little bit sick
Right?
It should
But we're not here to create a theology
That purple belt is a thing of value
Because of what it does
Not because it costs so much to make
Because what it does
That purple belt of Aphrodite
That contains the sting
That creates everything
And Hecate
Is the one who harnesses that power
In every realm
Okay, I don't know how to translate that into modern physics
I don't know how to say that
That's how they're looking at it
You guys figure it out
What corresponds to what?
I don't understand
That is Hecate
She of the Black Wolf
Thank you for coming tonight
I want to say a couple of things
Please, if you get another chance
Look at some of the stuff
My old boy who's doing pronunciation guides and whatnot
Look at that
And everybody's having a problem with Unit 2
Keep reading
Keep reading
Don't worry, it's supposed to be tough
It's supposed to be tough
But you can get through it
And I'll show you how to do that
It is my honor and distinct pleasure to have you
At the bed of the Muse
And I hope tonight that despite the graphic nature
Of what's going on in antiquity
That you may have come to a place
Where you can taste that history a little better
But when you can do that
You know yourself just a little bit
Just a little bit
Now run out and tell all of your family
And everybody you know what it means
To Christ somebody
Thank you for coming tonight, Hail Satan

And then you will pay
Sleep with the devil
And you'll be taken away
You must pay

For all that you did to throne
