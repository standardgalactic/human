I witnessed that. I lived it.
It still does not erase the scientific historical fact that Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park with a naked boy at 4am.
You can't wipe that out of history. He is still there. And I'm telling you, my brothers and sisters in Christ, I am telling you.
I am a man of faith. I am a man washed in the blood of Christ. And I am telling you, he was arrested in a public park with a naked boy.
Let's go. We're getting the cup, people. We're getting the cup. Let's get to the next source, Chewie. Watch this, people.
Oh, my God. And this chorus of these people come down now. What are they? They're driven last.
They're last by this murderous, and there's the, look at the last word in the first line.
With the oistress, the mania, the purple. Guess who showed up? Yay, it's the lightning. We're all here now. Welcome back, everybody.
Get up and start dancing. You can take it off now if you want. Throw on your leopard skin. Off we go. Off we go.
Somebody, somebody, give me that text. Here, look at this. Wait, go back to the first one, Chewie. We didn't finish our job here, did we?
No, but they ran upon, look, and what does this group of people do? They run up on this guy named Icarius.
And what's in their mind?
What is that?
Lyssa is the goddess of madness. If you don't know Lyssa, you haven't been anywhere yet. You think your feeling of the spirit was something?
Seriously? I'll show you how to raise up snakes. I'll show you how to drink poisons that won't kill you, right?
I am the Christ on the 13th. Isn't that nice? The antidote for the dote. Fantastic. Give me that last one.
What's happened? Look at this. One line of Greek people. And now remember 10 years ago, all kinds of people told me and told other people and flushed me out of academia because I was saying they were using drugs in the ancient world, right?
Not just medical drugs, but drugs related to the religions. Yeah. And people said, no, no, no.
We will not live in that world.
Yes. And I said, come here, you.
Do you feel that? That should get you all the way back to St. Andrews. That's where that should take you.
Sorry. There should be no spanking. There should be. Make a note of that, Chewie.
Let's go to the next. I'm sorry, but it feels so good. Look, the what is somebody's going to drink this stuff. These beyond somebody's going to drink this stuff.
And what's going to happen? They're going to drink this run this flowing of this wonderful wine, this amazing wine that does what?
That's a combination of mind and awakening. It literally says awakening the mind. Look at how fast.
Look at how fast. Incredibly powerful the ancient Greek is. Do you think you're going to find a word like this in Aramaic?
No. You think you're going to find it in Hebrew? No, you will not.
Do you think you're going to find it in any of the Italic Italic languages? How about Oscar? No, Umbrian? No, no, no, no, no.
How about the Samaritans? No.
It's Friday the 13th. Yes. Let's find where's that? Chewie, where is that whipping?
Bring in the whipping boys. Bring it. Yes. Over here, guys. Let's go. March, two, three, four. Bring them out. Bring us the next.
Bring us the next one. Bring us the next one in. Look at this. This is the awakening. I'm about to give you the awakening.
