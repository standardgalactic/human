We need things to balance that.
Phylloctetes didn't have it.
So he's always in pain.
He was the only guy who was able to burn Heracles.
He was the only one.
Dude had a shirt.
Dude killed his wife and his child.
And then he goes in, you know,
ends up in a shirt full of poison.
And this stuff isn't just,
this stuff is meant to incinerate.
Yeah.
And Heracles goes out in his deification.
This is the way of Chiron, guys.
Did we see it last time?
We saw it last time, right?
Everybody in the congregation is there.
We're looking at that formula now.
This is wonderful.
This is wonderful.
What am I bringing you tonight?
I want you to see more drugs.
I want you to see more drugs.
I want you to see more drugs
that are involved in the sex rights
that we know Jesus
with all of His technical terminology
was involved in.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ as a son of God.
He wouldn't have been the son of God.
He wouldn't have also been the only begotten.
That's a title within the cult.
Jesus Christ,
the guy who gets arrested
in a takedown at a public park
at 4 a.m. yelling,
I am not a trafficker.
That guy,
his cult that he is involved in
from which he is taking all of these titles
produces this sort of junkie.
Yeah.
Yes.
And I say junkie with the greatest affection
for every junkie out there.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's that search.
You can't...
Watchers tell me.
Tell them to stop.
Tell them to stop.
Every generation finds it.
Every generation looks for it.
Yeah.
It's fantastic.
It's the mental chemistry of humanity
all splayed out on history
like some kind of Jackson Pollock painting.
Love it. Love it.
Let's bring up some Greek and get dirty.
I want to get down and dirty.
And some of this is dirty.
I will be as technical and as educational
as we can possibly do this tonight.
Right?
Because that's where we need to keep it.
Be decent people.
Some of this material may turn you on
in some mental way.
Light up the stuff that's in there.
Yeah.
Let's try it.
Let's throw some of these drug dealers at you guys.
Okay.
Bring that first...
Yeah.
We start at the top.
I just want to start with a little bit of correspondence here.
Believe it or not, from some guy named Ewoks.
Yeah.
He's apparently, you know, of Arabia.
And it's just...
To who? Tiberius?
The Imperator?
Yeah.
He's a king.
He's writing to Tiberius.
He's like, dude, I got your gifts.
I got your gifts.
The Centurion.
What's his name?
Right?
He brought them.
He brought them.
And, you know, it's so nice to see them.
You know, I'm going to return around and give it back to you.
I'm going to give it back to you.
