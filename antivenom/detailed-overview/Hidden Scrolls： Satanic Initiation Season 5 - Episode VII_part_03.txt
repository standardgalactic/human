Boom, boom, boom.
You hear the music?
Right?
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Here it is.
What kind of drugs, people?
What kind of drugs?
As you get off the boat, you're coming.
What kind of drugs do you want for the festival?
Right?
Here we are.
Here we are.
Here's the first one.
It's going to get rid of all your pain.
Pain.
No pain.
No pain.
And why is this so important?
Because otherwise, with what you take, with what we're going to put into your rectum,
I'm being scientifically and historically accurate.
With what we're going to put into your rectum,
you're going to need some painkiller
because you will run around screaming otherwise.
Okay, okay.
Fantastic.
I'm there.
So give me that one.
Right?
Historically.
Not me now, right?
But historically.
Historically.
Don't take it there.
This isn't some dirty street corner.
This is the museum and the place where we educate.
Educate.
Excellent.
Excellent.
So here we are.
Let's get that same one.
It's got another drug underneath it.
This is great.
It's like we took down an ancient drug dealer.
So what do you got?
What do you got from Cyprus?
Look, what I'm just going to describe it in the middle of Cyprus.
You don't believe me.
I'm saying Cyprus on purpose.
That's where we're going.
The Adelphi.
The sister to these, right?
Is Ehitis.
Some kind of substance called Ehitis.
And it is named that way from the Echidna, the viper.
Yeah.
Which a long time ago they say phylloctides was healed with this.
Oh, isn't that nice?
It's wound.
Take it down.
He was finally brought off.
He had been there the whole time with Goldie.
Goldie was there.
Who's Goldie?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Okay.
In the life of any junkie, of any junkie who follows the gods.
In the life of these people is always, is always an oracle.
Always.
The gateway is open.
There's no other reason to be there in the midst of the pain.
There's no reason.
It's that oracle, right?
And his oracle, Goldie, drew him in.
She drew him in.
And she created that mortal whose immortality is given at the drop of that one.
That golden rod of Hermes, that golden rod of Hermes.
He uses it to wake you up.
It's after he puts you to sleep.
It's after he puts you to sleep.
Okay.
So there's going to be some of that, you guys.
Don't be, don't be scared, right?
We still got the music going.
Everything's cool.
Get back to those drugs.
Let's bring it back.
This is as much cult as we can bring forward tonight.
Yep.
Oh, love it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Next one.
Let's go.
The next one.
That's good.
We covered it.
Yeah.
