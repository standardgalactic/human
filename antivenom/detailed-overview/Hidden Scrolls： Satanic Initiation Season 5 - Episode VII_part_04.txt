Oh, I just wanted you guys to see the second sentence in this.
Now, wait, I'm going to show you something through this that is perhaps the most marvelous
and interesting thing that I've seen in a long time.
Look what happens, people.
Drugs, what are these children of the Greeks doing?
They're crazy to jump into these schemes where they're running after the drugs that cause
you to hear the demons, the demons.
You know what those young people are out there doing?
They're chasing the drugs that allow you to hear the demons.
Welcome to Cyprus.
You are here to find the voice of the diamond.
Yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
It's Goldie.
It's Goldie.
It's Goldie.
That's what they call Aphrodite.
Fantastic.
Back to the next.
Oh, let's give this one a second.
Gorgeous.
Okay.
Don't you love the classical art that we have all along?
This is both like an art history and an informative lecture on ancient pharmacology.
Love it.
Love it.
I'm hoping I'm putting people to sleep.
I've got to keep it exciting.
What do these children of the Greeks do?
This is what they do.
They make haste to follow these avenues where you can pick up these voices and you say,
wait a minute.
So in their mystery cult, they wanted to hear voices.
Yes.
In their mystery cult, the hearing of the voices is the breaking through.
Well, you say this is quite a revelation.
You want to have an altered mental state that is not just a place of euphoria and bliss.
Yes.
Turns out the bad trips are as important as the good.
Yeah.
That's what they said.
Not me.
Not me.
That's why you have so many of the Thanasimon, those drugs that induce the death state.
This is Hermes.
He's going to use that wand on your rectum just to give you a historical reality.
He's going to wake you up from your death.
You're not going to drink it because you're going to be dead.
He's going to bring you back.
Yeah.
And you'll thank him.
You'll thank him.
Turn you into a place you've never seen.
Oh, open things up.
It's a good purgative.
Let's hit the next medical one.
We're thanking like they did in antiquity.
Praise Jesus.
Yes.
Right.
Excellent.
This is another one called Ophite.
And that's from the root for serpent.
I'll just translate it to you.
This thing is a antifarmicon.
It's a drug combo that's paired with others.
And it's used for anything that you're applying that serpent venom to.
Isn't that nice?
They use it in the eyes for people who have problems seeing.
And it takes away headache.
And for those who use it, who are chronic users,
those who are chronic users, you know what happens to them?
They get better hearing down to the point that they can hear just the very slightest
conversation.
What?
This thing gives you superpowers.
Right?
You're able to hear better than you were before.
Oh, interesting.
And what else does it do?
I love this last part.
It starts on with Fossi.
Fossi, decaiton, achineton.
Yeah.
And with respect to those who are achinetic, take it down.
What is achinetic?
Well, in medicine, ancient medicine, achinetic is when you have no movement.
No movement in your skirt.
Yeah.
You are achinetic.
That driving force is not driving.
And do you know what happens when your skirt?
We're Mediterranean, so we wear skirts, right?
Don't.
Right?
We have to stay precisely accurate historically here, right?
