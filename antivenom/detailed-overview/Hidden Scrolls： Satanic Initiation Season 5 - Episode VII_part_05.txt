If your skirt has no movement, this drug can make things work.
Can make things work.
Let's see.
Let's see the rest of that recipe for disaster here.
What are we giving the people who are coming to the concert tonight?
This is amazing.
Yeah.
They're going to be able to see better and hear better.
And the ones that are achinetic are going to be led to aphrodisia.
And even some, you know, maybe some lightheadedness too.
Some lightheadedness.
But all of this is coming to us through that epithomeon, right?
Through kinesis, the movement and the epithomeon.
Epithomeon is desire.
It's sexual desire, right?
Right?
Blow this up a little bit.
Yeah.
No, this is not the one that I want.
Sorry.
Well, out of order.
You're out of order.
These are, this is where it takes you in your mind, right?
This is the kinesis, the motion, right?
This is just the, okay, dance or movement.
Change your revolution.
Kinesis.
You don't have any movement.
There's nothing dancing in your pants.
If there's nothing dancing in your pants, you got to put it in your pants.
You got a problem because you can't go to Aphrodisia.
And one of these Aphrodisia, yeah, these are the pudenda,
the festival of Aphrodite during the month of pudenda,
January, February, March, April, pudenda, May, June, July.
That's how they're ranking the value of this concept.
They can't.
This drug will lead you there.
Of course, we're on, we're in Cyprus, right?
And what do we do?
We get off the boat there in Cyprus.
Now, not today, not today, to my knowledge, not today,
perhaps in a secret kind of way, but to my knowledge, not today.
But in antiquity, when we, you and I get in our ship and go back to antiquity,
we step off the boat, step off the boat and you can smell it, fumigate it.
We're getting fumed the whole way up.
Once we get to the temple, we start partaking in the drugs.
We start partaking in the exercise.
Yeah, good.
Love it.
Love it.
It's healing.
It's healing.
Great.
Next text.
Love it.
Let's keep going.
This is a really distinguished, stiff shot professor because they don't want to talk about
things.
This makes their, their sphincter, sphincterize.
That's from a Greek word for to strangle.
The sphinx is the strangler.
Love that.
Love that.
Strangling is important for history.
Fantastic.
Look at this one.
This is a, what kind of, this is the lethal of strites, right?
I just want you to notice one more time, the pain.
The pain.
Why?
Cause we're going to be seeing more drugs that are going to be counteracting pain.
And here's a big one.
Watch this people.
This is some kind of lethal.
It's called a leap.
Leap baraios.
Leap baraios.
Love it.
This thing they say comes from Syria.
A Syria, excuse me.
And there was a dude, Memnon, famous king, you know, and he took, he took this stuff to
Troy, to King Priam, right?
And it was a great gift, man.
It was a, it was a mega door on.
This is a, this is a great thing that he did.
And what, what did he do?
Well, they say that the mages in Egypt and Babylon put Babylon honor this drug above
all the others, right?
What do they do?
They use it in their epodes and in their goateeus and their goateeus.
What is a goateeus?
It's not what you think it is, but remember we got a junkie, Phyllictides with us.
And this guy's on the purple and we want to see what the purple is causing the people
to do.
All right.
We're following that junkie.
Love it.
Love it.
Okay.
