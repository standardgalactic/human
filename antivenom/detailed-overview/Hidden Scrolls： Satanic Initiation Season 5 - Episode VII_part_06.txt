Let's, let's go to the, whoops.
We're off timing tonight, aren't we?
We're off timing.
Do I need to skip a, okay here, I'll try to be better.
Sorry.
Sorry to you.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Hit the next one.
Next Greek here.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Back to that one.
Back to that one.
This is where the magi, right?
They use it in their epodes and their goateea, right?
Not only that, but it has an effect on snakes, right?
And when you drink it, what happens to you?
You become mantic.

And somebody who sees what the birds see.
And it's by this instrument.
I'm telling you that they rule most, that they carry out most of their art, baby.
Those magicians.
Now we just had a drug guy.
Do you realize what just happened?
You just had a text from antiquity.
You just had a drug guy step out of the past and step up with you and say, you want to

Those priests love the gold.
I've worked for priests.

And when you put them together, that's when you can do the mystery.
Yes.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Love it.
Love it.
There's the ant.
There's the word antifarmacon.

Well, no, I know at least one.
Yes.
Carl Rock, every once in a while, you know, he will see these texts and hear these texts
