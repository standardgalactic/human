be cured in the process.
Right.
He's, he's aching for those drugs.
He's in constant pain and constant wreckage from his wound.
Yeah.
And he's administering the drug and he's in that state, but he doesn't have that painkiller.
He doesn't have the cure.
So if these wizards are using these drugs and they're balancing them out and you maroon
someone on an island without the supplies that he's going to need, you're going to end
up in a terrible situation where he wants to kill you when you get back.
That's exactly what happens to Odysseus and Odysseus has to try to outsmart him.
What are they all fighting for?
These junkies, the bow and the poisoned arrows.
Right.
Because it's been prophesied by some dude under the influence that this poison will bring
them victory.
Yeah.
Oh, it's fantastic.
You don't see the God in it, do you?
You don't see the God, but the God is there.
This is that blood.
This is that flesh.
You mean they even call it that?
Yeah, they do.
Ambrosia.
You know what's in the cave of Hermes?
The ambrosia.
Give us another drug.
Do we have that little one on the bottom?
Was that a little drug dealer in there?
What is this?
Yeah.
There's another one.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Now we're at a Bacchic rave.
Right.
Now we're at a Bacchic rave.
Music is loud.
Nobody can.
Nobody can.
All we can hear is shouting.
Right.
So everybody shouts.
Right.
And what is the, there's this thing called Nebretase.
Now here it's Nebretase, but that Upsilon is actually a beta.
Right.
So Nebretase, those are those skins, fond skins.
I forgot to tell you, take off your clothes.
Right.
We got off the boat.
Everybody disrobe.
Right.
Everybody disrobes and you get a bath.
You get a bath.
Oh, you thought you were going to show up and be like, no, no, no.
You need to get cleaned up.
Right.
So you get your bath.
Right.
You're all feeling good.
And now we're, we're marching up to the temple.
We're going to be getting hit by the drugs.
We're going to be getting hit by the drugs on the way there.
Bring that back up.
Where's my clothes?
I left us all naked.
No, no, no, no, no.
They're going to give you the skins, the fond skins.
Yeah.
You never wear a fond skin.
Oh, it's nice.
It's nice.
Yeah.
Fond skin.
God, you're not cultured until you are, until you are in a place where you can see both dimensions
at once and wearing fond skin.
So soft, so incredibly soft.
Oh, love it.
Let's see the next one.
Yep.
So this is just a continuation of that passage.
Right.
So this is from those who were using the fond skin, the buckets.
See that up front?
The buckets, right?
And this is for the people who were the therapists.
Yeah.
We got therapists there.
These are the people who are serving the community through the bucket cult.
Thank you very much.
Big hand out for those people.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Drugs, drugs, drugs.
She's got the drugs, right?
Whoa.
