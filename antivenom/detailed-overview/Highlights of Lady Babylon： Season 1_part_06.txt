There's reports of telepathy, out-of-body experiences, speaking to dead relatives.
It's the whole panorama of supernatural experiences.

And once you've uncovered that, it's really quite simple and quite obvious why these metaphors existed.
But since they are metaphors, they've been interpreted in a entirely different way,
but people who are unaware of the fact that the ancients were into altered consciousness
by the use of the psychoactive sacrament or an antigen.
Mythology is filled with cows and bulls, but not ordinary cows and bulls,
