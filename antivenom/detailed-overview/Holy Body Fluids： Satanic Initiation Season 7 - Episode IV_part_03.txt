What's, look, what, what's to cure or to treat of diseases?
I'm a healer.
I'm a healer through that shout.
That Bacchic shout.
Yes.
Why do you think this is all under the auspices of Apollo?
Right?
Every minute, Jesus doesn't exist.
There's no Moses.
None of that stuff that was, that was given to you
and what you call the Old Testament is a long time
not being around.
Right?
This is way before it.
And what are they doing?
That Bacchic chorus is upholding Apollo's healing cult.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Apollo's healing cult.
This is the great physician.
Now, do you know why the one who is the Christ has to be the great physician?
Why do you think, why do you think that's an issue?
Because that was the mystery through which Christianity was developing.
Yeah.
Right.
Here it is in the language.
Here's in the language.
Give that Greek one more time.
I want these guys because these guys are at Harvard are slow.
No, the Greek for the main phrase that I want to keep flashing up here.
Did we bring my goat tonight, by the way?
Okay.
Harvard, queue in here.
Here it is.
You don't need to speculate anymore.
Right?
You should have just read the sources.
I know you're going to a lot of banquets.
You're having a lot of drinking parties, whatever you're doing.
I don't know, but it's sure as hell is not the substance.
Let's go for it.
I anticipated you on the whole drug things.
It was 10 years ago, people were saying, oh, this cannot be.
Right.
Now they're all saying, oh, well, look, now we've got to study the degree to which the
drugs are used.
Yeah.
Bravo.
Let's just look at what we have with Jesus.
It gets my goat.
All of this stuff.
It gets my goat.
Look, look, ivory tower, look into the cross.
Look at it.
We have it there to censor anything that may be, that may be foul.
We'll cleanse this place with sulfur.
Did you know Jesus?
Here's a new one.
I'm going to pop this one on you.
You guys are so lucky.
Did you know that Jesus had dope in his mouth?
He had dope in his mouth.
He had what that mogus had.
He had that capacity to contain in his mouth the cure.
Right.
What this, this dope is, is bad too.
This dope is linked to the sulfur and linked to those snakes.
Remember when he said, I'll have you in a place.
Remember when Jesus said, I'll have you in a place where you can drink.
These things that induce death, right?
The serpents.
You can drink those serpents.
You can lift up those serpents.
Nothing will happen to you.
Right.
Nothing will happen to you.
This is that Jesus.
Right.
This is that Jesus.
I know people don't like this, this Jesus that we're looking at because he's a complete
total drug user.
When I read that article and saw the very idea that Jesus was using drugs is absolutely,
is absolutely the final frontier.
Yeah, it is.
It is.
Let's show him in all his glory.
That's why we're going tonight to his spitting.
That's why we're going to look at spitting Jesus.
Did you see Jesus spit in that dude?
Did he spit in his mouth?
Put his fingers in his ears.
Spit in his mouth.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Is he on the drugs?
Yeah.
They're coming out of his mouth.
It's polypharmacy.
Polypharmacy.
You turn the person into the drug dispenser.
Yeah.
That's how it works.
Isn't it nice?
Now you know why we have all of the accounts of the dangerous poisons that are on the
mouth of the people.
Right.
Next time you read something that you may learn in classical myth, something called classical
myth, you're going to read about Heracles dogs, for example.
What are they known for?
They're all known for that poison spittle.
Right.
They call it the madness of the dog.
Yeah.
The dog.
And people say, oh God, it's rabies.
Right.
Oh God, do you realize what that's attached to?
That's part of the Robogalia, isn't it?
Oh my God.
We're getting into the deep agricultural stuff now.
This is the real from the ancient world.
Yeah.
Watch that rust.
Watch that rust.
So here's what we have.
Bring back up the source.
Let's go to another one.
Oh, look at this.
Yeah.
Oh, I want you to start looking.
I want you to start looking at the spitting.
Just look at the second line.
What's he doing here?
He's spitting in a dude's eyes.
He's spitting in a dude's eyes.
And underneath that, look at you.
Look at your people at Harvard.
We don't talk.
We do.
We do, people.
And yeah, my students do too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is that bottom line?
Epithes das keras outdoor.
Right.
He's putting his placing his hands.
Now people say, is this the laying on of hands?
This is the one that's not the grabby sexual laying on of hands.
This is the one that's the putting on of hands.
