Frothy, aphrodisiac foam.
You've got to balance this stuff with the smirna, or you're in deep, and they tried to give
it to them while I was hanging there, and everybody's like, oh, why are they doing that?
It was a, they can bring out the fairy tale.
Bring out the fairy tale, right?
Bring on the British actors.
Let's just do this, the good old King James way.
Yeah.
No, that's not how it happened, dude.
They were balancing him, and we saw that, known us, told us that.
It's a balance for what is in that Eucharist.
It is the balance for that blood and body, for that bread and wine.
Yeah.
It's that balance.
Good.
You need it, or it's going to the side effect of that.
You need it, or it's going to the side effects are going to kill you, dude.
You might be hanging there on the cross, and just, boom, it gets you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then the Roman soldiers are like, huh?
Let's break his legs.
No.
Let's not.
He's already dead.
Just poke him.
Boop.
Right?
OD.
Do you classify that as an OD?
Did you know you saved your Christianity?
Everybody at the Bible Institute who was part of that article tonight, did you know you
savior was a junkie?
You know he OD'd to death?
Yeah.
If they had been able to get to him proper chemicals, they could have brought him out
of it.
They're doing that stuff all the time.
It's resurrection.
That was his deal.
All right?
Resurrection.
Death and resurrection.
All right?
Being born again.
I'm going to open your eyes, baby.
Whether you like it or not, open your eyes and look at the naked boy that's with Jesus
when he gets arrested for you in the public park.
Look at him.
That took me over an hour to get to that kid, but he's still there.
He's not leaving.
These are in the text.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Let's go one more time to that text.
I just want people to see that phone.
Oh, God, to see that phone one more time.
What does he do?
He makes that pasty thing out of it, but I want you to look on line three.
One, two, the second word, Pailon, and the fourth word, Phycephoron.
Phycephoron.
All my Greek students.
What does Jesus make?
Take it down.
He makes the Luciferian Pailon.
He makes the Luciferian or the light bringing medicine, the Pailon.
I'm going to put it in your eyes, baby.
All right?
You're going to see.
You're going to see why, because I'm the light of the world.
I'm the light of the world.
If you'd asked me how to give in you the water of life, you want the water of life?
Give me Jesus.
I know.
I know, Gangsta G. It's supposed to be a tree.
Gangsta G. I know Gangsta G is on the stuff.
That's why I want you to spit in my mouth, Gangsta G. I want to know what is in the blessed
mouth.
I want that holy Lugi.
I want it.
I want to rub it around the inside of my mouth.
No, is that too much?
Seriously of everything we've talked about?
That was too much?
Oh, my God.
Is anybody commenting?
The Lugi.
Seriously?
The sacred Lugi drove you off.
All right.
All right.
It was even worse.
That was even worse.
They called it.
They called the seed of Jesus.
They called that the love of God.
Isn't that quaint?
Give me some love of God.
Now you're like, oh, my God.
He was talking about that with his boys, with his little, my theta, his little students.
He was talking about that with them.
Oh, God.
Now you understand why he speaks in parables.
Do you think the whole time it was so that you would have some magic understanding?
No.
It was so you wouldn't understand what he was doing.
Look, when you're at lay stays, you've got to hide the stuff.
You can't openly function like this.
The authorities will break down.
Give me a Lugi, Jesus.
Give it right to me.
I want that Lugi so much praise and glory.
Hallelujah, Lugi.
Give it to me.
I would take it to right in the mouth a bit, you know, Jesus, Jesus, give me it.
Give me it.
Let's not be gratified by this.
No gratification.
Go to the next source.
What's our theon here?
They're going to identify it as brimstone.
What are you from the dark ages?
Brimstone.
Used to fumigate and purify.
Oh, love it.
Look at the resources on the bottom.
You see diascordes.
Notice that it's perhaps cognate with thuo guys and Greek thuo.
You know, that's the that's the word of sacrifice, right?
And I tell you every time I'm like, don't think of sacrifice like you think.
Think of it as using a substance on turning it into a vapor so that you can partake of
it.
You mean that guy standing out there with his vape pen is closer to ancient religion?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Right.
It's the way it is.
It was all connected.
They never separated.
The nature was a part of it, right?
And that's why Paul's going around giving everybody a hard time saying, don't call me that.
Don't tell me that I'm follower of the Christos, right?
And he's got his flesh.
That drug using monkey has his thorn in his flesh.
He's flying on the venoms, baby.
Yeah.
Love it.
It's just their combos too, by the way.
You can't just get them the way everybody else gets them, right?
Oh, gotta go through that oracle.
