You're really not getting anything from the Hebrew
Until the 2nd century AD
By then, it's over
The classical era is over
So what we're talking about is
We're talking about the originals
We want to go back
We want to see who is Satan
Who is Satan?
And it's not a very long trip
We can get there quite rapidly
In order to do so, we're going to start
Where we ended last time
We're going to start at the end of Mark's Gospel
Where Jesus is going to give them
The power, the commission
The going forth
He's going to give it to them and send them out
Are you ready?
Let's give it
Bring it up
These are the things, these signs
They will follow in my name
You'll cast out demonia
You'll cast out demons
You'll speak in new languages
Now get ready for this
I'm going to translate this
With 30 years of ancient Greek
Bring it back up
They will lift up dragons
And drink drugs of death
And won't be hurt
Wow, really?
What a bunch of cultists
Yeah, yeah, don't worry
We're smack dab in the middle
See what Christians
Or as they call them at the time
Because they didn't call them that yet
They called them those who followed the way
Are you a follower of the way?
I know the way
You know the way?
You know the way?
Yeah
Did you hear Barney got arrested?
Yeah
Something about intercourse with his mother?
Yeah
We're celsus
Before we get to celsus
I want you to see a video
I want you to video this video
And I want you to see those who use the venom
I want you to see those who are enthusiastic
I want you to see the ecstasy
