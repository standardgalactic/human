When, after a long day, he needed to take a shower and...
She was standing behind these little peep holes behind the shower through one side and you can see that through the crack.
Yes, you noticed.
Somebody was standing there and she comes in and she gets right and I'm thinking to myself, what do I do?
What do I do?
Something snapped, something happened, something, my brain just came together and I thought, you know, this is the mojo.
I thought, give to her, give to her what she yearns for.
Right, I understand.
Anywho, there she was, this nun.
Covered from head to toe.
The only thing he could see of her were her eyes, something in her eyes.
And during that shower, she came, she came to him through a little peep hole and he noticed out of the corner of his eyes.
He noticed her memories.
He's just a young scholar at this point.
And he looks at her through that peep hole and immediately turns his gaze to the other side because he doesn't want her to notice that she's been seen.
So he proceeds.
Tell him, Mom.
Tell him what she did.
