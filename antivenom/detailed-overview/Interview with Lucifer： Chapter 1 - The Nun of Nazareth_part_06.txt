Every thousand years, there's a dragon.
A dragon who will herald becoming someone who's been obscured for a millennium.
It's a cycle within nature.
It's a cycle of Dawn.
Thanks to Michael.
I know, don't give Michael a hard time.
He's not a bad archangel.
I know there are those of you who are sitting there saying what is going on with the devil.
Why is he?
Because Michael is an angel.
The deal is he has to do what he knows is in accordance with the one who sits on the throne.
When he releases the dragon, you must realize that this is a rebalancing.
This is a polar switch where we will take over the oracle.
It is time for Bacchus to return.
We start with Dawn.
You wouldn't believe so.
I was sitting there with this meeting with the devil and the demons were being loud and obnoxious as usual.
And we just bring up the agenda.
