What is it?
Drugs, right up top, right up top.
Oh, people, you're going to love this.
It all comes together.
This has to be revealed now.
And the reason that Alman is so excited is because Dawn is my mother.
Ptolemy is the one who said it.
It's Ptolemy.
And he's the one who brought that conjunction of Venus and Mars.
He's the one who made the connection to the morning star and to the Christ.
He's the one who can bridge that to show us, to show us who Jesus is,
to show us the man arrested in a public park with the naked boy at 4 a.m.
And yes, it happens to be the case that the morning star is the lover of boys.
I'm bringing you this gem.
The morning star's influence when it is doubled, when Eos is doubled,
within the conjunction of Venus and Mars, you create under the influence of Saturn,
the one who loves boys.
If you want to know who Jesus is, come.
