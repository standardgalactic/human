And fortunately for you, those gods were brought to you as snakes.
And your wisdom, your knowledge, your craft came from those snakes.
I do remember Eve.
Thank you, almond.
It's all dirty, dirty stuff.
Dirty prophets doing sick acts.
These will make your stomach churn.
You have a strangely interesting, attractive to us as victims of arrows.
As those of us who swim in that harbor of Venus.
Those of you who are part of satanic initiation, who understand, who have eyes to see.
Those of you who from the throne guide the world.
Yes, I'm speaking to you.
We will bring honor to the house of dawn.
Thank you, Hail Satan.
Back at you.
Thank you.
