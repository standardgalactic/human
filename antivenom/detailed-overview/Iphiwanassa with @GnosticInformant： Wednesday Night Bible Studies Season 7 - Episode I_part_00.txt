Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name all the way?
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to the very decent last season of Satanic Initiation
And tonight we come to Bible studies
And oh my goodness, do I have a couple of wampers for you tonight?
It's going to be delicious
And I just want everybody to remember that we are covering everything with crosses
Covering everything with crosses is our chorus
Love it, love it
It's a decency thing
We'll have Gnostic Informant later
In order to provide comment
To answer some interesting questions
Difficult questions
Questions that you wouldn't answer
If you had anybody looking over your shoulder
Fortunately, we don't
So we can go to whatever texts we want
And on Lady Babylon Bible Studies tonight
We're going to go in deep
Welcome
Tonight on Lady Babylon
You're going to be watching some of the most profoundly powerful and impactful images
You're going to receive these into your mind
You're going to become one with that idea
And that may cause you to be uncomfortable
It's okay
It's not me
While you're sitting there, I had the machine dialed for the 15th
We're going to take a quick jump out tonight in the 15th
And the way we're going to get there
Is we're going to parachute right out of our space-time vessel
But it's okay because Beccadilly is going to catch us
Beccadilly is going to catch us
I'll say a few words about him
After he shows up
But tonight I want to just let him sing for you
Everybody
This is Beccadilly
Becadilly
Becadilly
Fantastic
Becadilly puts everything in perspective, doesn't it?
Now, Becadilly got in a lot of trouble writing it now
The dead Medici's liked it
And it was at the front of the Renaissance
But in his work on the hermaphrodite
There were certain things that the prevailing society around
Didn't want them to be talking about or thinking about or looking at
And one of them was the hermaphrodite
What Becadilly did was he took that sword edge and plunged it
Right into the heart of the church
And he got the response that, you know, he should have predicted he would get
He had to come to a place to recant
You too shall recant your understanding of history
Love it
I've brought you some great stuff tonight
And I'm very happy to be able to bring things to an end
I'm very happy, I'm very excited to be here
I'm just, oh, you know how it is when you're in that place
And you think, wow, when they said apocalypse, this is what it is
Turn up, did someone turn up?
Did somebody turn up that global thermostat?
Somebody turned up, Chewie, did somebody turn up that global thermostat?
Keeps going up, fantastic
Let's bring you right in tonight, okay?
Now that we purify the place, Becadilly
I just want to take you in, show you some of the real
Give me that first, Chewie, hit it, beautiful
Yeah, this is who I want you to consider tonight
Ifi wanasa
Ifi wanasa
Yeah, this is an old, old, old name
You see the ifi on the front and the anasa following
That anasa or wanasa is an old Mycenaean term
It's an old Mycenaean term, can you see this people?
This is old, the stuff that you think of is history
Before it ride, this is before all the stuff
And what does this mean, take it down
This is for every woman in the audience tonight
This is for every woman
It means the queen's force
Queen's force, what is that?
I don't even know what that is scientifically
Queen's force, is it a perfume?
Can I spray some of that?
See if it smells good, it's making me tingle
Queen's force, that's who we're looking at
Ifi wanasa
Let's hit the next one
Oh, I just want to take you to 1331, now people
With all the clues and everything
You know what you have to do, get your decoders out
1331 it is
Take us to the next star chart
There we go, I want you to read this tonight
Here we go, are you ready?
Who are we talking about, a pice?
We're talking about a kid
We're talking about a kid wanasa
Right, a thousand years before Isaac
Was getting his sacrifice
Ifigenaya was the sacrifice
In the third century
When people began to make up
What you call the Old Testament
Those people, they borrowed
Sorry, they borrowed
From older established mystery cults
That followed not Moses
But the Muses
And so they borrowed
Judaism is a creation
The religion, right?
The religion is practiced
By ultra-orthodox and orthodox
That practice is based in
A much older mystery practice
Where the girl is sacrificed
To the goddess
Do you know what we do in this type of world?
This is the type of world of Lupercalia
This is the type of the world of Lupercalia
You know what we do?
Thank goodness, Evander showed us
It was his mother who gave us the alphabet
What's her name?
What's her name?
We're in Italy now, people
Did you feel that bump?
We just got to Italy
What's her name?
Her name is Carmenta
Wait, who?
Carmenta
That's what we say in Rome
What are those knuckleheads in Athens say?
Musa
Oh, yes, okay, fine
She was here too
She did the same thing
She brought us a whole bunch
Of letters and showed us how to write
How to bring these images into our logos
Oh, fantastic, fantastic
That's Carmenta
Nice to meet you, Carmenta
This is your history, people
Right?
This is the history
It's yours
Sorry, let's go to 1331
Flash, it got my goat for some reason
Did you see that, Julie?
It got my goat
There he is
It's not a heat
Hi there, sweetie
There's my goat
Right?
You remember to imprint the sacred image
We cover up that which is unholy
With the sacred image
You'll remember now the cross
Thank you, sweetheart
That's enough
You can go back
Beautiful
I have my goats too
Alright, let's go
I came armed with goats
Who are we talking about?
We're talking about the child of Agamemnon
Who is this?
Who is the predecessor?
The later civilization
Creates this Abraham Isaac image
It is Iphigenia
And just as the child
Remember Mary is 12
All that stuff in the temple
With her nourishment
They call that the burning off of mortality
Isn't that great?
Anywho, all of that
In order for Mary to be able to produce
The aqua wii type
People have been asking
And I'm not giving out the formula anymore
Because there's nothing that can be done with it
In order to do it
You would have to take the formula
And you would have to give it
To a person over a period of years
Until they develop to a certain stage
That they could then produce
The water of life
It can't be done
It can't be done
Maybe
But I would never say never
Let's go back to the 1331
Take these few
1331, what is she doing?
I'm going to translate
Leave it up
I'm going to translate for you that
But it's very difficult
Because my English
With all my Anglo-Saxon ancestors
Talking with a very limited vocabulary
We couldn't come up with much to talk
With mouth and brain things
The Greeks have some concepts
That are kind of ancient Greeks
Have some concepts
That was a biting there
Ancient Greeks
The language facilitated the communication
You think it's the chicken before the egg
But it's the language that facilitates your development
They're just beginning to study now
See correspondence
Between our development and our language
Well, it turns out it tracks back
To some drug-using
What you would call sorcery
Culp activity
All kinds of deep, dark, secret stuff
Medicine, midwives
It all goes back to that
Yes, it does
Yes, in fact, it all goes back
Okay, Chewy, hit me with the next one
Look what she's doing
She's thusa
What are you doing when you thusa?
You know what tithuo means?
It means to take your incense
And put it on the fire
Whatever method you got
And to sit there and hotbox that stuff
Just breathe in, breathe out, baby
Breathe in, breathe out
I bring you the drug users down
That's why you love it
There's something about you
I can feel you
You've been here all seven seasons
And I can feel you
Like it when I bring that out
You like it
You do
I imagine
I imagine you do
Look what she does here
What is this girl doing?
She's performing catharsis
She's performing the purgation
This 12-year-old girl
Is performing a purgation?
