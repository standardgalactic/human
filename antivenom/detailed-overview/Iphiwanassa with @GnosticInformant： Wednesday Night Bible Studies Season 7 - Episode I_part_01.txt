Yes
This is what you call the wedding of Achilles
Did anybody notice
That Medea ends up with Achilles
In Elysium?
Yeah, I thought her name was Iphigenia
It was
Iphigenia ends up with Achilles
This is all about a marriage
It's all about a holy marriage
Don't you Christians
Know something about a holy marriage
We're bringing the new Jerusalem
Which, by the way, is a Greek word
Jerusalem's a Greek word?
Yes, it is
It's the opposite of what you thought
Okay, let's go
That era, mate
Yeah
People, stick with us and we'll do the civilization
You'll love it
I just want you to look at that first line
These are the things that cannot
This is the thing that cannot be
It's made obvious
It cannot be spoken
It cannot be revealed
It is ineffable
What is ineffable?
Amen
The flocks
The flocks is ineffable
That's what she's doing
She is fumigating the ineffable flocks
And you and I are sitting here breathing it in
Oh, God
Are you kidding me?
No
No, this is ancient cult, right?
You said she's 12
Mary was 12 and in the temple
Of Jerusalem
She was there in the temple
Say the cops
Thank you
Shout out to the cops
Copic shirts, show me your tattoo
Love it
Keep up the magic, guys
Oh, God, love those cops
I love cops
I do, I'm sorry
I shouldn't say that
This is for serious people
But I do
Let's go to the next one
Go to the next source, right?
Look at this, people
What is the operatus, right?
It's the forbidden, right?
The forbidden not to be spoken the secret
Look at this, number two, the sacred things
It's ineffable
And then they give you the example of the flocks
Which is 1331
Euripides
What does that say about a goace?
It says a man of mystery
Here, cover that up
They were supposed to take that up
Go to the next one
Fantastic man of mystery
I'll show you a man of mystery
Look here, people
This is Tarkon
Take it down
Who is Tarkon?
You didn't even know this guy existed
Did you?
Did you know?
You can't know the Bible without knowing this
Woo
You can't
These are the dudes who founded your mystery
Fantastic
Who are they?
You need to think around it
Late Bronze Age
Late Bronze Age
Remember, this is a thousand years before any of the Bible
As you know, was invented
Okay, fantastic
We're getting back to something deep
And here's this guy, Tarkon
Who is he?
Think Northern Italy
There's a strange group of peeps
In Northern Italy
And these people
They ain't nothing like the italics
Nope, they aren't
They're unique
Their language especially
That thing's weird
Pulascian
Everybody thinks it's Pulascian
There's theories
In antiquity, there were theories
Gotta love the Etruscan
They gotta finish working on Etruscan
I know they're working on it
And they've made a ton of progress
But they need to
Gloriously give us everything
Beautiful
What about that thing from Limnus?
You guys never got that done either
You know, the watchers are watching you scholars
And although I have to give it to Harvard tonight
For publishing
Beccadelli
I have to give it to them for doing that
Otherwise, I can't give them anything
Yeah, no, I can't give them
It's just poopy
Poopy results, guys
Poopy
There's a lot missed
Let's go to some missed stuff
You guys can learn
No, you Harvard props?
Pay attention
You can learn some things
Let's go to the next text
This is John Littes
And he's talking about Tarkon
Who is this guy around the Trojan War?
What is he doing?
He's a...
Wait, what is that on the second line?
Athoscopos
Athoscopos
What is that?
Take it down
It is somebody who sees
Through that thorn
Yeah, he was a seer
Do you see the seer?
We don't have these today
And you hippies
You psychonauts
No, I'm not talking about you
I'm not talking about you at all
Thank you for being there
I'm talking about ego death
Right?
That's pathetic
That's pathetic
Come back
And what you got is nothing
You go there and you come back
And you got nothing
Because you didn't know how to tune
You didn't know the physics
You didn't know the complexity
It's not just one drug
Blasting you off the moon
And all of a sudden
You got vision?
No, it's not
They're compound drugs
Yeah, and until you've had the mania
You haven't been there
Until you've had the mania
Full stream
You haven't been there
Until you've been into death and back
Haven't been there
You just got to
Get a little atomic energy out of it
That's all
Congratulations
We're talking about the real mystery
And it's going to take more of a hippie
You know, more than a hippie
To crack this thing
We need serious people on this one
Oh, God, I love it
Did you hear how important that sounded?
Take that empire
Okay, Tex, come on
Who cares what I think?
Go to the Tex
Go to the Tex
What happened to Tarkon?
Oh, well remember
Now look, it's going to talk about him
Being a student
You know, who's this guy coming?
There's the student of the
Who's this Teranis?
And who is he?
Well, he's a Lydian
He's a Lydian
Oh, remember, the Etruscans
Probably come over from Lydia
In Asia Minor, right?
And what does it say there?
All this stuff is made clear
In the Tuscan letters
In the Tuscan letters
Fantastic, let's hit the next one, please
Why even mention this?
Well, because I'm going to continue translating
At the time, Evander hadn't gotten there yet
Right, he hadn't showed up
He hadn't appeared, right?
And what happened?
Those letters, right?
By that time, they hadn't been switched over
We didn't have the benefit of
Cormenta, thank you
Genius of human civilization
Totally unrecognized
By any of you thankless mortals
A woman in history
A woman in history
Who gave you the capacity
To develop this
Just sit and think on that for a minute
That's the Evander we're talking about
And because he hadn't come around
Because Cormenta hadn't done her thing yet
We didn't understand
We couldn't work with their alphabet
But it's good that we didn't
Because if we had
All of those things, he says
All of those things that are aporeton
All of those things
All of those things that we cannot speak
All of the necessary
Future outcomes
What?
Yeah
Yeah, he just went quantum on us
You gotta remember, this is
We're working with Pagoya
We're working with that
Oracular philosophy
We're talking to Egeria
So that we can bring the future
Into the present
Yeah
So we can make the future
Isn't that gorgeous?
Now again, remember
We're with that girl
We are with her
Okay, once we lose sight of the cult
We're gone
Amen
Give me some more cult
Feed me, everybody
Get back on that throne
Is everybody on the throne?
