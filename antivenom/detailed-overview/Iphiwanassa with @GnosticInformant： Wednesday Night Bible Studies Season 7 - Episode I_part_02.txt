Get back on that throne
Okay, bring it down
Bring it down, yeah, that's it
Okay, look at this, guys
What is she doing?
What is she doing?
She's
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, can you hear it?
Hallelujah
What is she doing?
Hallelujah
In this friggin' barbaric language
And doing magic incantations
That's what that says
That's what it says
Just like somebody washing off
The stains of murder
Wait, what?
What can this...
What does this girl do?
In the temple
She sacrifices people
And washes off the stain of murder
With purifications
That involve the purple
If you will notice
Where Iphigenia ends up
And I'll make a reference to Snake Island
If you'll notice where Iphigenia...
This is the place
Notice the place
Oh, God, isn't that gorgeous?
Just imagine yourself there
Imagine yourself there with her
Uh-huh
And what is she doing?
She is purifying you
And the only thing
That's here
Is a purple processing plant
Down at the base
Down the cliffs, right?
Where the water meets Gaia
Right there, they process the purple
And what does she do?
What does the first Christ do?
She sacrifices
She sacrifices
That's quite something to ask a 12-year-old to do, isn't it?
It is
It is
Let's keep going with the text here
That's a beautiful image
Let's look at the next text
We need people to feel like
Taking a lot of things to do
The next one
Look, I just wanted to see some vocab
Look at it
Look at it here
On Ololudzo
To cry loud, to shout out
And look at how smart we are
Look at Roman numeral number two
To excite by bucket cries
What a lame definition
We can't even define what they're talking about here
Because you can Ololudzo
And you can Alaladzo
And you can Elaladzo
And there are three different things
Why?
Because they paid attention
They understood the notes of the cosmos
They understood the seven
Do you have the seven stars?
I don't think you do
I don't think there's a single one of you
Who can bring us to death
And back to life
I don't think you can
I think you should take all your pharmaceuticals
And shove them
You can't do that
Bring me the one with the water of life
Bring me that one
Then your science matters
Then your science matters
And when they cure cancer
You won't be shocked
Yeah
How old do they live?
That's what I want to know
Somebody who's been put on a regiment
That controls gene expression
To bring out your viper
How long do they live?
Under the influence of the drug
It turns out it's longer
Did somebody do some studies on the way?
Figure out what's going on
This is a type of medicine people
That we don't know
I'm releasing to you tonight
That medicine
It's about gene expression
We need it
Why do you think they called her Medea?
Because all the stuff she was doing
With all the drugs and venoms
Was healing people
All they had to do
Was find that stick with the snake on it
She was there
You mean one woman is the founder
Of Bacchic religion, Dianic cult
And everything that paved the way
For Judaism and Christianity?
Yes
Yes
And if we want to change that story
All we got to do is say
Her name wasn't Musa
It was Moses
Yeah, or Moshe
Whatever one
Moshe was my roommate in Israel
Who went crazy
He was
He went crazy
He ran off into the woods
Screaming
But
That's beside the point
Let's go back to the text
Okay, I want to bring you some more
Open up some more seals
Bring you some more revelation
This is fantastic
Hit me with another little bit of vocabulary
Mangeo
Just call forth by magic arts
Call forth
You don't forget
This is necromancy
Okay, keep going
You know
A god can give you the
Horme
A god can give you the urge
Okay, just wanted to say that
Throw that in there
Go ahead
Yeah, so what happens here
This is from the Bible, right?
This is Bible study
So everything that I've set up
Until this point is just context
Kids, for those of you who came
To Sunday morning Bible class
Or it's a Wednesday night now
Grandpa, what's up?
It's okay
It's okay
I know my children
I know what you hear from my Lampkins
Here it is
It's Acts 1935
And what happens?
Oh god, there's some kind of
Rockets going on
And what does he say?
He says to the Ephesians
He says, who is it?
Among men who does not know
That the city of Ephesus
Is the neocoron
Of the great Artemis
Who fell from Uranus
Yes
We
Hear an Ephesus
Turn that down
We in Ephesus
We are guardians
We are keepers
Of that which fell from Uranus
The Artemis
The Artemis
Where did she land?
Where did she land?
She landed on Snake Island
She landed right on Snake Island
And from that place came
This
The human mind
Was a little bit of that burning purple
You can change the world
They called her Medea
Her name is the root for medicine
Fantastic
Let's keep going to the next one
Next one
Here we go
I want to take you
It's going to get a little bit
A little bit rough
I just want to show them
That the neocoros was the
Okay, somebody who is a warden of a temple
That's fine
Okay, keep going
Let's go
Yeah, thank you
Well thrown
Urania
Because none of us would be here
Without her
Now for those of you
With ears to hear
I want you to understand
And this is fun, right?
This is fun
You get it?
I felt somebody out there
Get it?
Like popped in
El Thronus
You know that we've seen
What that Thronus is
Right?
When you have
Polutronus
You have something that's of many
A concoction of many different thrones
And that throne
As in the throne of Satan
Is where you're able to enter that state
Right?
I want to show you some animals
Getting high in a minute
From an ancient text
And I know none of your teachers
None of your colleagues
Have ever talked about animals
Getting high in antiquity
And I wish everybody here
Would send a letter
To Harvard
And Yale
And Princeton that cut off its classic
Classical Greek program
They should send them a letter
Say why didn't you read us
Any of these texts?
No wonder you idiots
Are going bust
Yes
And when I say bust
I don't mean money
You'll always have money, Harvard
I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about your lack of intellectual resource
That's what I'm talking about
Yeah, love it
Let's go to the next one
