You can see why I'm so popular
Yeah, no, but they're writing books now
That took my research
They're saying, oh, maybe he's not wrong
Yeah, you caught up
A guy, Brown, said
You'd catch up within 10 years
Took you a couple more than 10 years
And speaking of these animals
Getting high, look
I just want you to look at this
And I'm going to give you a source here
That you've never seen, people
We're in the seventh
And we're going to finish
But before we can finish
I got to throw that really good
This is stuff that you're not going to get anywhere else
This is an almond cocktail
Yeah, you're not going to get this anywhere else
Love it
Bring you your rippides
And what is this?
It's the geoponica
And this section happens to be
On the elements of sympathy and antipathy
Right?
On the physical natures
What are?
He's going to define for us
He's going to show us
He's going to show us
Who's going to show us?
Zoroaster
Now, don't get excited
All you Persian fans
Don't get excited
Cyrus out there, my buddy
Don't get excited
I know, Zoroastrian, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This is Julian
Or Julius Africanus, excuse me
This is Africanus
And he's using this name
Good
And what happens here?
Look, he says he's going to explain to us everything
But I want you to jump down to Manthana
In line three
Or section three, paragraph three
Right?
And he wants you to realize that
Look, you know, you can have an elephant
Something giant, you know?
Going crazy
Going into mania, right?
My nominos, right?
And what happens?
He can become calm
He can become pacified
Yeah, yeah
With a, with a ram
Look it on, you know
Do you understand me?
Just turn on your decoder there for a minute
Turn on your decoder for a minute
It gets weird from here
And look at verse four
Or section four, if they're not verses, right?
What happens to the bull?
That wild bull
He can calm down, boy
And stop his
Rrrrr
Ride, ride
Bound, how does he, how does he stop?
Because he's bound, he's bound by that
Fruity fruit
You know what I mean?
He's bound by the fruit
Do you know it's a saying in antiquity
You can extinguish
The ardor of the bull
Only with the breath of the virgin
And you think
This is a place of creepiness
Until you realize
That just as the Etruscans told us
Through their prophets
There is a language that must be used
In order to access this area
And that language holds the key
The Heretic stuff is all there
Because of that logos, that reckoning
The language is bringing the reckoning
The language is the device for your brain growth
It's not just psilocybin or whatever
Else they're going to start throwing at people
It's not that
Yeah, it's cocktail, by the way
Water of life
If you had asked me
I would have given you the water of life
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Wouldn't you like to produce that water of life?
Wouldn't that be something?
That's the future
Yeah, coming back
Coming back to that ancient wisdom
Can we get to the point
That we can understand half of what they were saying
I would be happy if I could understand half
Yeah, fantastic
Why? Because it's just
I wish I had the opportunity
I swear, I'm going to end up in Tartarus
Torturing my Anglo-Saxon ancestors
I think
Yeah
Let's go to the next
Here we go
Boom
Yeah, this is Locos
Yeah, go
Locos, wolf
What is going on with this?
What?
Look at the wolf
I just wanted you to see the wolf
Now why am I bringing you a wolf?
This has nothing to do with the Bible
It has nothing to do with...
Yes, it has everything to do with it
I told you we were at the Lupercalia
Right, and I told you the Lupercalia is the prep
For the mystery
What are we doing, man?
The boys are stripping naked
They're running through the streets
And beating people
Yeah, and then we take that same boy
And we put him in front of a statue of
Artemis
And we beat him
Publicly, big crowd watching it
With a leather strap
Nothing serious
Just something to
Make him scream
Right, and what does he do?
He runs up to the ladies
And he slaps and hits him with that thing
He's all naked
Mark Antony was
Supposed to be the leader of the troupe
For the one they made for Julius Caesar
That ended up, but he got canceled
There's some stuff that went on
They didn't like
But, that's Lupercalia
This is the Luper
Right, this is she
Do you remember where that cave is?
Romulus and Remus
Yeah
You know they took her milk
The milk of Mary
Guessed there
Where that comes from
That's from the cave
That's from the cave
Romulus and Remus
And Luper
Great Wolf
Oh, she was wonderful
She was wonderful
A thousand years
A thousand years
That voice
Came forward
Mmm
The quantum physics
You can't appreciate
The quantum physics of this
It's just impossible
It just, religious awe
Is what is the only
Thing that kind of comes close
To appreciation
Let's go, let's go to the next one
I gotta just keep giving this
Yeah, oh what is this?
Orobacos
The fruit of the pomegranate
The fruit of the pomegranate
Did we have that in there?
That was in our wolf
You know what you call a wolf?
You call a wolf this
The Orobacos
And you'll see Bachos in there
What is
What is
Why is Bachos associated with this?
Give me the next one
And by the way, notice
Nicander's Thariac
Thariac is on there
869
We've talked about Thariacs
We all know what they're for people
So guess where we're bringing this
Oh, Orobacos
Of course
This is what means what inspiring Bachos
There's a lot
Of getting Bachos
There's a lot of getting
Entering into that place
The Thuoscopos
The Haruspex
As you come to call it
Thanks to the Romans
The Haruspex is that one
Who sees through
That
Divination by fumigation
Alright
Can you hear it?
Okay, let's go
Let's go to the next one
Sorry, I'm clipping you short
People are getting there
Hurry up man
Nostics waiting
I just want to see a few words
With this horse
And this Bach
Look, you can do the same thing for the women
For the place
Even the locale stuff
Next one please
Oh God, look at this
We're going to read some revelation backwards now
Just to get the purge
And here it comes, yeah
So I was taking in the spirit
To this mountain
You see what the people
Who are the Haruspex
The
People who use
The fumigation
To fly
You see what they're saying
They're taking up in Pnellmati
You know how Mary
Got pregnant
For those of you who are here for the Bible study
Kids
Mary, the mother
Of Jesus
Got pregnant
By God
At 12 years old
Doing
