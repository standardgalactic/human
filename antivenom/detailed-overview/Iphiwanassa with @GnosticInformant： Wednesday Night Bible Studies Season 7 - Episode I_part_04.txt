This
By means of the Holy
Pnellmati
The Holy Spirit
You know what the Holy Ghost
For those of you who are in the circles of Christianity
Or have been there
You can go back and remember how it was
A lot of people have written me
And said I came out of Christianity
Thank you very much for doing your work
And thank you guys for saying that
Being nice
People are saying
Hey, we've come out of it
And I know exactly what you're saying
And it makes sense what you're saying
And I want to
I want to explore it now that it makes sense
Okay
That's the perfect
That's exactly why the museum was built
I didn't do anything
I just came in and looked around
Artifacts, it's not mine
Belongs to the muse
Love it, and people recognize that
I love it, I love it
To my old guy, I got an old aged guy
Love ya
Yes
Even from the kiddies
To the
Methuselah
A museum is for everyone
It's for everyone, that's why
When somebody tries to stop you
And I want to ask Neil about this
When somebody tries to stop you
By turning you in
For
Obscenity
Yeah
From Renaissance nudity
I know, there's a lot of this out there
And I know it's just
Targeted
Coming my way
I know that
Don't get desperate people
Don't get desperate
There's always a solution
If you want to shoot holes in the falcon
We'll cover up those holes with crosses
Yeah
We'll cover them up
Yeah, love it
Oh god, let's go
People wanted to hear some of that
I'm holding people extra time
Here's it
Let's do this backwards
He's taken up into the mountain
In the Pnellma
He's flying
Way up high
And what did he see?
He saw Haagian
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
There we go
Tune that vowel
It's from Hieros
Which means holy
And the
Sigma Lambda Mew root
Which in one case that we know of
Is a form of medicine
Is a form of medicine
Interesting
Do you mean
If you go right now
And look up the etymology
Etymology
Etim
Etim
If you look up the etymology
Of Jerusalem
You're going to find it's Hebrew
And there are guesses from Mishnah
Stuff way later
It just is sitting there
With Greek roots
It just is sitting there
With Greek roots
Something is wrong
The language is topsy-turvy
It is saying
This is no, this is older
This is older than you think
Yeah
And it's later assimilated
Right? As the
Old Testament was written
In the third century
It assimilated, the name back
Translated it
You know those guys with the Dead Sea Scrolls
Do you want the secret of what they were actually doing?
They were sitting there copying
Into Hebrew
The Greek
Yes
They didn't do it because their language
Is so tiny
Yes it was
By then it was liturgical
They didn't have a shot
Of course they were doing the best they could
Because they were trying to build a tradition
Some kind of cultural foundation
The rest of the world around them
Had
Gone into civilization mode
And
If you're going to be in this mode
With the museum in Alexandria
You're going to have to come up with a foundation
We're scientists
We sit and study these things
So this is when Judaism
Is really invented
It is invented then
And it is based on
This older mystery cult
That comes to us from the Bronze Age
Of which this
Ifegania
This force of the woman
Is the founder
I'm looking for that
Queen force
I'm looking for it
We're going to look all through these texts
Until we bring out
Lady Babylon
And let you see the most influential woman
In all of
Earth history
Yeah
That's who we're looking for
Let's go to the next one
We're almost through
Sorry
I'll hurry up here
I just want to see the medicine there
That was Andromachus as well
The wolf, by the way
Can you just go back to the wolf
Because I don't want people to miss this
Look at this guys
Look at number six
Number six
Roman numeral number six
Nickname of Piederasda
Pederast
What do you call a pederast
The wolf
Is it because of
We all have weird impressions
Of wolves? No
It's because it's a cult
And cults
Have symbols
That they use
And when I say symbols
I do not mean
Images, mental images
Metaphors, I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about identification
I'm talking about putting
Two pieces of the puzzle together
That match perfectly
That is the Sumbalon
Give us the next one
Here we go, Sumbalon
Atali, each of two halves
Corresponding pieces of an astragalos
Or any other object
Which two Xenois, strangers
Or any two contracting parties
Broke between them
Take it down
So you make a contract
You break this thing
They come together
Lock and key
It's proof of your contract
It's identification
Hit the next one
You're not going to get this in a bible school
They don't do this stuff
What is that astragalos
They would use knuckle bones
Knuckle bones
And why all of a sudden
Guncretz woke up
We're talking about sortace
And what are the original sortace
They're used with human bones
Have you ever seen somebody's spinal bones
And their neck
Have you ever seen those
You can take those and fill them together
Perfectly, like a little puzzle
You take one dudes, take them out
Fill them together, this is what we do
It's like a wishbone baby
If you break it, there's only going to be
One connector, right
It's going to work, one connection
Here we go, we're making the connection
Can you feel this?
Oh, just fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, love it
Give me the next one
Secret code
Wait, what?
This is the same definition of what I just showed you above
I just scrolled down
I couldn't fit the whole definition on the page
What is a symbol on
The word that we use
Is symbol in English, right
Which is not the same thing
What is a symbol on
Secret code
Okay, now
When somebody starts talking about secret codes
Walk out
Walk out, because
99.99% of the time
It's BS
But I didn't bring you
This secret code
These Victorians did
Through the Greeks bringing it to us
And what is the secret code to them
Look at this in the Greek
Mystical
Symbolon
Orgiasmon
Orgiasmon
Oh, you know that's good
You know that's good, don't you?
Love that
Love that word
It's the mystic
Symbolon
The one that they use
In those mystic
Rites of Dionysus
Okay
Now, wait a minute, you're going to say
Wait a minute, you said there were drugs
