You told me there were drugs that they're using
Yup, that's good
You said there were songs
Yup, they're singing
You said that there was this frenzy
Sometimes some flash eating
You're going to let me eat some flash
You promised to bring me to a place
Where I could eat some flash
Yes, yes, don't worry
Don't worry
It's all there
It's all there, but this is also there
This is also there
Yeah, a secret code
And what is the secret code?
It's a combo
Get ready, the linguists and the intellectually curious
Will like this
Are you ready?
Turn off the lights
Turn off the lights, just sit there
It's signum
And responsum
It is a sign
Or a push
It is a wave moving forward
And a wave returning
It is a signal
And a response
It is the fitting together
Of those
Vertebrae
Don't you love that?
Don't you love that?
That's what this symbol on is
And that is what is used
Look at this
What are we looking for?
We're looking for the orgiasmos
Look at how the Victorians
Translate this
Celebrating
Of orgia
Okay
What does that mean?
Notice that they're related there
They're related there to Dionysus
The worship of Dionysus
And that's why I brought you this passage
To show you
Is that one? Nope, that one's next
Go to this one
Oh, it's not
No, it's further down
Here, let me see, hang on
This is my fault, not Chewie
This is the passage
I had it in the wrong place
Remember, you told me not to do that
Chewie
Thank you, Chewie
There's another explanation
You know what I mean?
All the women
In this place are totally
I'm translating
Are totally enslaved
To the Orphic rites
They love these
orgiasmos
They really
Get into the
To this thing
And they've been doing it for a long time
They call them the clodones
The mimalones
That's what they call them
That's eponymously what their name is
And, you know, they do many of the things
That
Don't I do?
And especially they do a lot of things
That the Thracian women do
The ones that go and celebrate on
Hymone, Mount Hymone
You know what I mean? They're all doing the same things
And, you know, I think, it seems to me
At least, that this is where
The verb in Greek, threscawing
Comes from
It comes from this crazy
Extreme cult
Activity
And, you know, who's worst at this?
Who's worst at this as Olympias says the text
She is the worst
She's the most zealot
You see that word for zealot? Zealosa
Zealosa
She's zealous to enter
Into that enthusiasm
That state of
Total stoneedness
Yes
What does she do when she's fumigated
Everybody? She brings in
These barbaric
It's not just barbaric
It's strange to us
She brings in these giant
Strange snakes
And what do they do?
They climb up and down people's
People's
Sorry, first where they do
They're in a basket first
She brought out the mystic
Baskets
What happens? They climb out of the mystic
Baskets
They climb up the thersis
And the headbands
Of the women who were there
And they
I love the last line
And they scare away
The men
Isn't that great?
That's Plutarch
Talking about
Olympias
And her getting into the mystery
This is a real thing people
It's a real thing
Okay, we gotta bring Gnostic on
Let me just make sure that's
I'm gonna go ahead and cut it
I'm gonna go ahead and cut it there
There were a couple other things
But I think it's nice
To bring on Gnostic
Let's bring him on
Welcome, Gnostic
Thanks for having me, man
I've kept you for a long time
Jam packed, sources and stuff
I never even heard that
I probably kept you way too long
You know what?
I'm taking a break from some editing anyway
You're about to bring out a new piece
Speaking of which
What's your new topic?
So I'm covering the first
Two centuries of Christianity
And it's not
So people are told
The understanding is that
There's proto-Orthodox
And there's a perfect straight line
From Jesus to Paul
Justin, martyr, Irenaeus
Eusebius and so forth
That's bullshit
The early Christianity was
A lot more wild
A lot more
Ritualistic
A lot more Platonist
A lot more Pythagorean, Orphic style
Bacchic style
It was very religious
A lot of mania
A lot of Eucharist
A lot of taking substances
Going out into the wilderness
Dropping out of society
Having egalitarian societies
And cults
With women in charge
I have a lot of sources
Proving that too
So I want to show people
Early Christianity
Is not what people try to make it as
A lot of times people
Backtrack and say
These people were heretics
And they always were heretics
But the truth is
No one knew that these people were heretics
These people were revered among Christians
Popular
Writing texts in Alexandria
With funding
With support and patrons
These were the real early Christian fathers
And some of these so called heretics
Are
Have genealogies that bring themselves
Into the so called
70 disciples of Jesus
For example
Marcian is a big one
Marcian is the first Christian
To have a canon
A New Testament
And he, according to the sources
Even the people at Haydn say this
That he was a student
Of Thutus
Which is one of the people that Paul traveled with
And his father
Was Philologous
Philologous is
Counted among the 70 disciples
That actually knew Jesus
He's one generation away
So you'd think this guy would know a thing or two
And by the way, in his possession is all
Paul's letters
How does he have all Paul's letters?
It's not like today where you just can fact stuff around
And send emails
If you have a copy of Paul's letters
In this early second century
You know people that knew Paul
You're right there, right?
You're in that world, you're part of that system
Of early Christianity
So I'm highlighting that and then I'm going
I show how the evidence proves this
Then I go into what did they actually believe
What were they doing?
And it's a lot of wild
What you would consider Ba'kiq
Ba'kiq in the sense that
They're going through these ecstatic
Worship ceremonies
Speaking in tongues
Taking Eucharist
And baptisms
And going wild and getting the Holy Spirit
There's a lot of that going on
Because
I have a whole list of these early Christians
And what they were talking about
What they were doing
And that was one of the big ones
Obtaining the Holy Spirit
You would have to go into an ecstatic state
Of ecstasy
And mania
For the Holy Spirit to possess you
And that was important
That's bigger than anything else
So
Yeah, I'm going to show that too
Yeah, no, I love that
I love that
Entering the Spirit, you know what I mean
And all the prophets are doing it
You know what I mean
And all the people, the priesthood
That's getting the voice to speak
In the tabernacle
