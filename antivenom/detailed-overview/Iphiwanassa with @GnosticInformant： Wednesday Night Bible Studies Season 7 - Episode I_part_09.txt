Franklin
They're all were
Even the
And yeah
They were friendly to the churches
Because these are people living in the nation
They're not going to
Genocide Christians
It's not what they're trying to do
It's just that you don't let that
Be the power
Don't let them have the power
It's that simple
Be a Christian over there
But you're not taking control
Because your system is just
The last three, four hundred years
We can see over in Europe
They're not doing okay over there
And I just want to say something else
About the idea
That it's an invention
Well
Here's one something I want people to think about
Because the question would be
How do you know it's an invention
How do you know they weren't already
Doing something similar before
Well
We have time capsules to show this
The first time capsule
Is the Phoenicians going down
Going over to Carthage
And what do they believe in
Is there Abraham's stories over there?
No
They're worshiping all the same gods
Everyone else is worshiping
Interesting
And they start colonizing
After 700 BCE
They're still colonizing
So it's like they're right next to them
Why aren't they
How come they don't know all this King David stuff
They just don't
I'll even go closer to 300 BCE
And 400
Between that 400 to 500 BC
You have a large amount
Of Jews moving down
To Egypt to Eliphantine
And they left traces
We have physical text
In Aramaic
From this time period
And this is 400 to 500 BCE
This is after
Well this is like
Contemporary with the Persian period
Persian period, it's second temple
They should have a whole Torah by then
They should have the whole Bible
They should have everything, nothing
They don't have anything like that
They don't even say the word Judaism
Doesn't exist in this text
There is no Torah in this text
There is no
Legends about Abraham
Yahweh, yeah that's there
We know Yahweh is pretty
He's an Iron Age God
But guess what
He also is doing
They're also worshiping Osiris
And Isis and Mott
And Cunum
And Horus
So it's like
And Patah
Standard Polytheistic Egyptian stuff
Written in Aramaic
By people that call themselves Jews
And wonder that Tacitus comes along
And says they were just
They were worshiping
Set on Crete
And ended up
Ended up going elsewhere
And you know what bothers me about that
If you read the
I think the Oxford translation has
A little commentary on the bottom saying
Most scholars think he's wrong
Or something like that
But we know for a fact
That the Philistines
That are living in Gaza
And those cities
And on the coast
Who are Canaanites
They are part of the same
They have a Phoenician
Alphabet and everything
They are from Crete
So is he really wrong
For saying that they came from Crete
He's not, he's looking at the
Geography and he's looking at his
He probably has source of history
Mentioning when the Pleskians
Fled from Crete
And went in different directions
And that was one of the directions they went
They became the Philistines
Pellistet is in the Egyptian sources
And it comes from Pleskian
And I'm not the only one that said that
There's like ten different scholars
Who have pointed this out
Pellistet probably means
Probably is a derivative of Pleskian
I love that
I love that
I hope it can be
Put up even more
It's a frontier
That would also mean that Pellistine
That would also mean that Pellistine
Comes from Pleskian too
Those Philistines are Pelioi
Man, they're old
They were there before
Even according to their own Bible
The biblical text even says
The Philistines were there before they even got there
So even they had
No way around that one
What happened
To the Canaanites
That were there
Everywhere you go in Israel
You dig down deep enough
Some kind of Canaanite development
And they're all gone
They're all gone
What happened? Do you think?
Let's just predict the future
And this is terribly serious
But satanic initiation is terribly serious
If we have all of these people
That have been in effect
Wiped off of the map of history
In antiquity
Because you don't have any Canaanites walking around
You see any Canaanites?
I don't see any Canaanites
You see any Edomites?
No, you see any Ammonites?
You mean there's a group of people?
Yeah, there were
Just like languages
Just like languages, Neil
People get wiped out
I'm wondering
Is that what we're watching now?
Are we watching that history develop?
People say
You're going to be political
The whole world right now is looking at this
The entire world
Is looking at Israel and Palestine
They're watching this
So all I'm asking is
As a historian
As a scientist
Are we just doing it again?
Ptolemy and Demetrius fought there
The Egyptian pharaohs fought
The Hittites in this region
This is like the stadium
For wars or something
This little Gaza Strip for some reason
Always right there
You know that's why
You know that's why the evangelicals love it too
They love it because
This is exactly what they prophesied
This is what we've all been saying
For so many years
And writing down these novels
And left behind
We're all sitting there in our pews, Neil
Christians, we're all waiting
Now don't tell anybody
But the Christians know
That the Jews
Will be wiped out in the end
They already know that
And they're rooting for them
They're waiting in the backstab
Once enemy number one is gone
Which is the Muslims
And then all of a sudden it's going to be enemy number two
It's messed up
In the meantime people die
In the meantime people die
People, children dying
I'm not sitting there choosing one side or the other
It's a difficult situation
But it's not good
I'm not sitting there rooting for one side to kill the other side
That's not what I'm doing
I'm just getting sick of watching
Of kids dead
I'm just getting sick of looking at dead kids
You know what I mean
So messed up
Welcome to the messed up world
Somebody turned up the thermostat
With a mental thermostat I think
So I'm going to give you the second last word
And then I'm going to hail Satan and call it out
So just give me a shout out
Of whatever you want to say
Man, just check out the sources
Get acquainted with the ancient sources
And get an understanding
It's a big world
It's a big world, it's a big history
And
There's never, it's never
There's enough for everybody to
Come up with something and come up with
Some understanding
What happened?
Because history is kind of a mystery in a way
We don't have it all fleshed out
There's some
There's some things to look into
You know, it's
It's open for anyone to go
And explore
And bring something back and show people
Because it's vast
Everywhere you go, every part of the world
Yeah, amen
That sounds like something spoken by
Somebody who's guarding the doors of the museum
I love it Neil, I'll stand by your side
You and I in Tartarus baby
Love it, love it
I'm going to end up by saying
You know what we've just attained
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
On a wave
Why did you ever change your name?
On a wave
Why did you ever change your name?
Hail
On a wave
