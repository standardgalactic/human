There's only one
Toxic Venom and Dia's Kiss
Dancing to the bank, catching checks
Cracking whips, Athena with a dark tip
Maltese Island sacred drift
Catherine of the water, purple amethyst
Chickadilla plus one on the list
Bumping tracks in the ride, dark harbor high tide
All wheel drive, poccatane with a theory act
Pauling for Medea, we throw pedophiles to the lions
I'm with a rogue group of Roman rebels
Who make rope and fashion crosses
The root cutters with the black arrows
But they are dreading green
Sacred, your darkest dreams
Come to your history
Days with no use are saved
But they are dreading green
Sacred, your darkest dreams
Come to your history
Days with no use are saved
In touch with what's going on
There's another one coming out
Wake the dead with Sean
Wake the dead with Sean
Fun stuff, fun stuff
But I want you to know
As the Satanic congregation
I want you to know that I'm working hard
I'm working hard to bring these texts
And to show these people
It's a difficult road
We have to maintain the integrity
Of this ship
We have to keep going
Remember, we'll just wait
We'll get there
We're going in tonight
But while the ship is still pushing us back in time
I want to let you know I'm working hard
To be able to bring this reality to light
All we want to do is raise those texts
All we want to do is give people a chance
Yeah, love it
Your eyes will be open
Yes, exactly
Now, if we end up naked
That's the mystery, isn't it?
Fantastic
Tonight, what I've got for you
Is a portrait of the man himself
A portrait of Jesus Christ
Through the ancient Greek
Right into your brain
Oh, God, are you going to love it?
We met his angry, angry father, Yahoo, last week
Last time we left him off
He was bashing heads of children
Oh, God, these texts that I bring here
I bring...
You realize I do this on purpose?
I bring you the...
Just the cream and the crop, man
Just the cream
Just the cream
Oh, God
All the stuff
Nobody will read
Now, tonight, I'm bringing you the stuff
People do read
Or they try to, at least
And I'm going to give a warning
For the evangelicals in the group
You thank...
I just want right off the bat
Right?
Satanic congregation
Get on the throne
Get there into that place
You know, take off
It's time for Satan to take over
Now, what is going to happen tonight?
Tonight, we're going to do a little bit of exposing
After...
After the talk
What I want to do is to bring in Gnostic Informant
Who is at war
This guy is totally at war
He is geared up
We're going to have to put a statue
Somewhere in the museum
Not a huge one
He doesn't need a giant bust or anything
He just needs a modest, you know
Kind of Hercules-themed kind of thing
Because he's working
He's working
And he's working with tax
He's doing...
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that
Look at that, marvelous
We're back, baby
You can't hold us back
Right? Fantastic
What year is it?
Okay, here we go
Look, it just gave me a time to have a break
But I don't want to waste your time
I don't want to waste your time
Now, we're going to look at some
Ancient texts that a lot of people have looked at
A lot of people have come up with just the craziest
Some of the dumbest ideas about
And they sell these things
They put them online
And you can sell them
Or they have big churches
On the weekend, big gatherings
Big gatherings
Where they sell these ideas
And the people take them
Yum, yum, yum
Love it
Well, tonight we're going to actually look at the texts
And we're going to say
What is it saying?
Just translate the Greek for me, bro
Tonight I'm running interference
I'm running against that grain
We're bringing back Lady Babel
You know what I mean?
You heard me, Lady Babel
The one with the tower
Oh, God, love it
She's gorgeous, right?
She's really, really, really gorgeous
Now, I want to cleanse this place
I want to cleanse it with a poem
And this is a work by Nancy
So thank you, Nancy, for the purgation
Let's get this temple cleaned out
Liminal, by Nancy
Let me enter this harbor from my weak knees
Let my voice fill with hers
New tongues, new waters
Lapping together from the east
Where we dream the oceans
And they always dream us
This
This is the ancient shell game near the shore
Washed from the old depths
To the new heights of uranos
And the return to finally float measureless
Like a child who expects to be born
But not before the heavy pulse of labor
The tearing of flesh
The taste of blood
Copper cleft
In and around the mouth
Whatever waits for me out there
Is only some sunk ship
Layed in with coins
Is just some dead star
Ready to exit our sky
Here I learn to breathe
The breath
Before
To after
Where I find her currents
And I can swim again
Here I rise
I miss took as merely prayer
Thank you Nancy, thank you
That's what we're going to do when we smell sulfur
Right, you bring that poetry out and you cleanse the place
You just get rid of all the trash, right
All those daimonase, they just run away
I'm going to show you some sulfur cleansing
Are you ready?
I want you guys to get ready because we're going to see Yahoo
And we're going to see Jesus
Wait, who? Yahoo and Jesus
That's who we're going to deal with tonight
Standing side by side
Father and son, gods
Oh, these are the ones
Wooo
This is the rock and roll tonight
Yahoo and Jesus
Side by side
Are you ready for this? Who is?
You tell me, well first
I got to take you to where they are
And where Yahoo and Jesus tonight
They're in the apocalypse
They're in the apocalypse, right
I told you guys, I warned you, satanic congregation
All that child sacrifice stuff
Right, I told you, let's stay away
For many things, genocidal
Bad idea
I told you what it would do
It's fueling it
It's the fire for the monster
Love it, it's gorgeous people
This is the most gorgeous physics on the planet
Love it
The potency
Just think about it for a minute
Put your mind in the sandals of antiquity
Right?
That child sacrifice is potent
He was like, give it to me Abraham
Abraham's like, what do you want? Yahoo
Yahoo's like, give me Isaac
Give me Isaac, you know what I mean?
He wants him tied up
He wants him tied up and sacrificed
He's about to do it too
He was this close to doing it
Father's Day of the Year
Now we get to see him
Where are we? We're being judged
Do you people not see the reality?
You've been here, you've been baptized
You know how it is
We're seeing the reality around us
That's the power of the Oracle
That is the song of the muse
Let's bring that forward tonight, shall we?
Thank you for your time tonight, by the way
Give me my first bit here
Chewie, warp it to
Apocalypse, 1823
I hate revelation
That sounds like a...
That sounds like some kind of...
You know what I mean?
You know where I'm from
This is the apocalypse, baby
Yeah, what's gonna happen?
We're watching the destruction
I'm just gonna bring you there
We're watching the destruction
Who died? Who's been destroyed?
Babylon, that great lady
Has been destroyed
He says, look, yeah
There's not gonna be any lighted lamps
In you anymore, honey
There's not gonna be any marriages
No nymphs running around
You're not gonna hear any of that
All that happy marriage stuff
Oh, and all the merchandising
The sales, the markets, groceries
