All that happy, prosperous stuff
You're not gonna have this anymore
Especially with those aristocrats
He says, may he stun us
Those big boys
Where they own everything
You know what I mean?
Why?
Why are we getting judged?
Why, tonight?
Is Yahoo stripping us of all of this?
I kind of like the marketplace
Why is he stripping us?
Because...
Pharmakia
Because of your drugs
You got it on the bottom there, people
Especially you evangelicals
Who've never read the Bible
If you're sitting here tonight, an evangelical
And you do not read ancient Greek
And I'm not talking like Kip Greek
I'm talking somebody who's actually read some texts
You've read Homer
And shut up
What is the Bible scholars
The theme tonight, by the way
It's a Bible scholar fest
Because that, I'm trying to get everybody
Tuned up in the Christian mystery
We're gonna be eating flesh here
As followers of Jesus
Right around the corner
Wait until you see what he's dressed in
We're at the judgment
What's going on?
Babylon is burning
Yeah, why?
Because of her pharmakia
Yeah, her pharmakia
That's what caused it
Yeah, her pharmakia
She's caused the people everywhere
To go into a state of planetus
They've become planets
Yes, we wander
We wander
And how do we do that?
We do that with drugs
Pharmakia
What do you think that's there for?
Right?
Are you listening to Yahoo?
Are you listening?
It's because of this
Next verse, let's get that next verse up
Ooh, that was a gorgeous picture
That's nice
Everybody, shout out for Chewie
Who's drugs are they?
That are the enemy tonight
The drugs are yours
They're your drugs
They're my drugs?
They're your drugs
Let's go to the next one
Lady Babylon has drugs
She does
Look, oh, okay
Cue Jesus
Cue him
Bring him in
Oh, God, where is he?
Give me the lion tamer
Come here, Jesus
Come here, Jesus
Christ of Nazareth
They're twelve
And they're all boys, you freak
That was too much
Let's go back to that text
Show us, Jesus
Chewie, give me Jesus
Blow it up
Blow it up
I'm an old man
What does he have on his clothes?
And his maron, his thigh?
Did you know?
Okay, I challenged you tonight
And I said evangelicals, you've never read
The New Testament ever
I know you haven't, the Bible, the whole thing
You've never read it
Here's an example
Did you know that Jesus has a tattoo on his thigh?
He does
He's got a tattoo, that's what it says
And what is it?
It's an onomah
It's a name
Now, listen, nuns, priests, preachers
This name
It's so important because what you have snipped out
What your exorcists have cut out
Is the history of this
It's the name that contains the power
It's the name I can feel you as
It's the name I can feel you out there
You exorcists, I can feel you out there
I've been around you
I know what you are
I know what you are
That's how we always find a way in
Let me show you
How you find a way into the exorcist
Are you ready?
What's written on Jesus' thigh?
Take up his little skirt
Bring it up
Let's see Jesus
Look at that thigh
What's that thigh say?
Basileus Basileon
And Curios Curion
Oh man, it's got a little phrase
Jesus has a thigh
Has a thigh phrase
God, what are these words?
This is the king of kings
This is the king of kings, man
And the Lord
Curios
The Curios, right?
That's the name that they had to fragment
That's the word they had to fragment right there
Curios
In the third century
When they wrote the Septuagin
Or what you call the Torah or the Bible
In Greek, right?
Not translated, but wrote it in Greek
When they did
This is the term Curios
That they took and fragmented
Linguistically, threw it on the ground
And then said, stuck
Their own terms in there for including Adonai
Right?
Including Elohim
They stuck them all in there
Why?
Because this is a Greek term
This is really not anything
But an old Pulaskian term
Yeah, when you go back to Pulaskians
You can take
Gilgamesh and
Dig a hole in your backyard
And bury that third grader
Oh, my God
You can take your library at Nineveh
That's not a library
It's a shopping list
There's nothing in there of any
Redeemable value
It's no wonder those cultures
Never came up with democracy
But ended up attacking democracy
No wonder
The language is who you are
Did you know that?
You are what you speak, baby
You are what you speak
Oh, I see in this dirty place
Is a bunch of Anglo-Saxons
Speaking
Barbarians
Yeah
Speak
There's no music in your logos
You walk, you trudge
Why do you think the apocalypse is here?
Angels, man
Let's show them some angels, chewy
Bring in that angel
Sexy, sexy angel
Yep, no, that's just King of Kings
Let's keep going
King of Kings
Right in this Lord of Lord
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
Go!
Fantastic
Now I'm gonna bring in a chorus
Because you've seen this
But I want you to have this in your mind
Because 500 years before
Any of this foolery that you and I
Are talking about has surfaced
Before Jesus is yelling in the public park
I'm not a child trafficker
While the snaky kid runs off
Standing next to him
got a bandage on his, on his yahoo, on his yahoo, right?
No, this is, I don't know how to be more clinical
than to say his penis is bandaged.
The boy that Jesus is arrested with
has a bandage on his penis.
Okay.
I told you, you don't read the Bible.
You never have.
Here it is.
Oh, this is not the Bible.
This one right here is a chorus
and I'm bringing them back 500 years.
This is Greek that if you don't know this, Dan.
Don't you guys hate smug?
Neal's on a quest to take down smug.
Smug, I'm a Bible scholar.
I'm a Bible scholar.
Bend over Bible scholars.
Here's a fresh injection of a chorus.
Woo!
Fifth century, you're gonna love this, yeah?
If someone know this for a fact, all of you,
say Tenant Congregation, open up your ears.
Know this for a fact.
This is true, what I'm telling you.
If anybody sets about to do something
that is just full of hubris and whether it's a deed
that's done with your hands or your tongue,
you're both, you're guilty in both circumstances.
Those of you who don't have a fear of justice,
those of you who don't respect the powers that be,
Wicked Moira is coming for you.
Ah, Wicked Moira, Wicked Fate is coming for you.
Isn't it great, people, you thought?
We're gonna have throne.
This is the great white throne of judgment.
Fantastic.
You mean we can actually rest in the fact knowing
that the people who perform the genocide
are gonna get justice?
Yes, that's what makes us worshipers of the gods.
Yeah, you and I, say Tenant Congregation,
we worship justice.
Can you hear the power of the Oracle?
Because when we look at Jesus in the apocalypse,
he is that power.
Are you ready?
Let's see him, come on Jesus, come on.
Let's show, give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
How's the show of paintings going?
Do you think they get the subliminal stuff?
I think they do, chewy.
Nod your furry head, no?
Yes, yeah?
Okay, good.
Protomant this.
We're going back to her.
That's where we're going.
The first, do you remember when everything started
with Uranos and Gaia?
Do you remember in the Arche, in the beginning,
when they were?
What happened?
Got that voice.
Eywa, we all said.
