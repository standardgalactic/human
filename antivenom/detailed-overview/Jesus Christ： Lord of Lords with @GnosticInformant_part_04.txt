especially if you're a Bible scholar
because all you read is one text
that's already been translated.
Let's be honest, none of you actually translate.
I know, I used to teach in seminary
and I took their programs through the roof.
Love it, beautifully, hugely successful.
Why?
Because I actually taught them how to read the text
and we read texts together.
I didn't leave them with anything that was one,
here, we're gonna spend the next two years on John 316.
We also looked at some tragedy and,
so a lot of different history stuff.
Love it, love it.
They loved it too, man.
I bet they're using it to this day.
You go, you go, gentlemen, you go.
All right, fantastic.
Let's get to the next one.
Here we go.
Look, he's gonna shepherd people with the robdon
and that's the thing that Bacchus carries around.
That's the thing that Bacchus carries around
and you're gonna say, Dan, that nothing here, right?
Nothing here shows any connection between Christianity
and anything pagan, anything pagan,
especially not the Resurrection Festival, right?
That couldn't be, that couldn't be pagan
because Jesus, he's an original gangster, gee, he's original.
Yeah, yeah, robdon, Dan, it's a rod.
It's the same one that the Septuagint says
that Moses is carrying that turns into a serpent,
just like the Egyptians.
Just like the Egyptians.
Now, you don't think, Dan, that this is actually,
that this is actually Bacchus.
That Jesus is just doing things that Bacchus does.
Well, let's keep reading the verse, Dan.
What's this say?
Dan, I know you're like, oh, quick, you can't,
you're looking up, Dan.
I know, I know, your vocabulary sucks, Dan.
I know it does.
Let's go.
Right?
Who's Dan, by the way?
Dan is your ordinary evangelical know-it-all.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, let's not say, let's not limit it
to the evangelicals because this is just the,
this is the guy of faith.
Dan is the guy of faith and he's proud.
Dan is proud because he went to the Bible Institute.
You know, he's probably,
probably sat on some committee or something.
Right?
He's got a thing on his wall that says,
I am a Bible scholar.
Right?
Okay, Dan, put down, it's, you can say, Dan,
to all the Dan's of the world.
You say you read Greek and I know for a friggin' fact
you don't.
Let's go to the next one.
Read this up, read this up.
Look, bring it up, blow it up.
Oh my God, yeah, so he uses that rabdon, right?
Same thing that Moses got, but ready for Bacchus.
What else does he do?
He does the action of walking on the grapes in the press.
He's the one who brings that wine from the press.
It's the wine of what?
It's the wine of the orge of God.
It's that wine of that wrath of God.
Who do you think brings that?
Who do you think?
Why is Jesus using the wine treading?
Everybody knows Bacchus walks around with the rabdon.
Right?
Everybody knows that Bacchus is carrying around snakes.
When Jesus is walking around saying you lift up snakes,
it's not because he's trying to be Bacchus.
It's because his cult is Bacchic.
Congratulations.
You just saw Jesus for who he is, Dan.
Yeah, you can squint real hard if you try.
It's not gonna help.
Let's go to the next one.
Oh, read this one.
He's also the Ponto Crattor, right?
Yeah, it's a title they used of Hermes for hundreds of years.
So let's see the messenger.
Why is he invoking a messenger here?
What good is that?
Keep going.
Oh, I saw an ongelon.
Right, you forgot.
We're all at the party, right?
We just took the drugs at the party, right?
And what are we seeing now?
The ongelon.
The ongelon.
Remember, it's because of our pharmaquia
that this is all, you know, he wants to take it away.
Long story short, Yahu doesn't want you to have the drugs.
Long story short, yeah.
And it turns out the best one comes from Lady Babylon.
Yeah, yeah, he doesn't want you to have it.
The devil, the devil's got mojo.
He knows how to make that garden work.
So he wants you to have it.
He wants you to know that that liar,
you mean God can lie?
Yes, the very first lie in the Bible is by God.
Yeah, amazing.
Devil's like that lie in sack.
He tells you, kill you if he ate it.
No, there's a way your eyes will be open.
Yeah, he'd be just like him.
And he knows that that was the devil, devil's mojo.
Here we go, give me the next one.
Oh God, and what that angel say?
What now, look people, are you ready?
Okay, for those of you with ears to the ear, tune in.
Make sure you're on the throne.
Are you ready?
And I saw one angel standing in the sun.
And he shouted in a great voice,
saying to all the birds of the air,
pay attention, come to the banquet.
Of God.
Okay, come to the banquet, he's saying to the birds.
Now wait, did you hear it?
You're augurs out there.
Those of you who are augurs out there, did you hear it?
Did you see the birds flying around?
Do you understand the signs?
Yeah, yeah.
Then you'll be able to comprehend what is happening.
Listen to the speech.
The speech is agurial.
Yeah, he's telling those birds, time to come to the feast.
Are you ready?
Are you ready people for the feast?
What are we gonna get from this feast of God?
We get to have the marriage.
We get to have the marriage on the face.
And we get to have, what else?
What else do we get to have?
A feast people, a feast.
What are we gonna feast on?
Everybody, all you Jesus loving people.
We'd love you Jesus, hail Jesus, all of you.
He touched me, oh, he touched me, he touched me.
Are you ready for his feast?
I got just a hint of Michael Jackson there.
Did anybody else?
Let's go.
What's at the feast of Jesus?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
It's the next one.
It's the next one.
Okay, are you ready?
You're gonna eat something.
You're gonna eat flesh, baby.
Flash, you know what Jesus has in his great banquets?
He's got the flesh of kings.
You get to eat Putin's butt roast.
Isn't that gonna be cool?
Isn't that gonna be cool?
What else?
The flesh of leaders.
Leaders, military leaders, social leaders, civic leaders.
You get to, you get their flesh.
You get their flesh, you know everybody.
Come on, you know you're getting revved up
and hungry for the flesh.
You want a little Biden hoagie, don't you?
You want a little Biden hoagie, don't you?
Well, you know what else you get?
You can eat some generals, too, and you can eat the strong.
Isn't that great, the strong?
Jesus is gonna give you a banquet.
You mean when Jesus comes back,
he's gonna serve a banquet,
and that banquet is gonna have cold cuts of people?
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
And now you know why the Romans
said they're gonna be the end of us.
This cult will be the end of us, right?
Didn't you wonder why the Romans,
they don't care what your religion is.
They don't care.
It's when you revolt.
It's when you try to tear down the government.
Something Thomas Jefferson says happens every 100
to 150 years, which is right about now.
The only solution is the blood of the tyrant,
poured out to liberty.
That's the only solution.
If you won't accept the voice of the people,
the people will shed your blood for liberty.
Yes, when we speak, when our vote is heard, yeah.
Then we know, then we know.
No tyrants.
There'd be no tyrants overthrowing governments, right?
Sorry, it's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.
No, no.
Not on your watch.
Yeah, love it.
Love this.
Prophetic, you wanted some prophetic stuff, right?
But look, people, you know what I'm doing.
Everybody here is a total nerd.
You know what I'm doing.
All I'm doing is taking those historical patterns
and giving them back to you, right?
Showing us how that we bounce.
That's all, you can do it with just studying history.
It's why it's so good to study history.
You can tell what's gonna happen.
Yeah, lovely.
You'd think that this is why the prophecies are so important
because they can tell you based on what they have seen.
This is the likely outcome.
Oh God, I love it, I love it.
Oracular wisdom, it's fantastic.
Give us that next one.
Okay, people don't have time.
Look, they're like, look, it's been an hour.
When are you gonna call in Gnostic?
Look, why am I doing all this for you, this banquet?
So you can eat flesh.
Remember, this is the same God who wants you
to drink his blood and eat his flesh.
Smash the babies on the ground, right?
What's your reward?
You get to eat more flesh.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Oh, there we go.
And I saw a Therion.
I saw a Therion, I saw that beast.
Yup, and the kings of the earth and the armies
of the earth all gathered together to make war
with the one who sits on a horse, good in his army.
We got a nice war going, people.
And I can promise you slaughter.
I can promise you slaughter.
This is what everybody who loves Jesus knows
is going to happen, right?
They're waiting for,
why do you think they're not gun shy, right?
They're ready to get this stuff started.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's fulfill this prophecy, right?
It's what they want.
Let's go.
Next one.
Boom.
And what happened?
Now, this is the most important thing I've said all night.
Are you ready?
Look at the third and fourth words in here.
To Therion.
To Therion, that's what's traditionally translated
