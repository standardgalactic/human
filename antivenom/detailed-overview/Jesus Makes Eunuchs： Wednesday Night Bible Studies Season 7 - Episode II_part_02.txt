Whether or not, I'm not talking in courts either, talking about nature, talking about being, talking about nemesis. Love it. Bring me back. Let's go on from Virgoia.
I want to bring up. So where do we go from this prophetess? What happened? Yeah, when he opened up the seal, the seventh, what happened? There came, there was a silence.
Got sucked into the universe. Wait, where am I? Remember, we're with the visionary cults, right? So don't, don't be shocked at the big back and forth.
This is what happens with the Pnellma, right? Didn't you see what Dumas said, right? Dumas, apostrophe after the S, right? We know.
Dumas, didn't you see what he said? It's that throne, baby. We take ourselves to that throne. Where are we here? What happened? There was the silence, right?
And I saw, what did I see? The seven angels. Oh God, which ones, baby? The ones that are right before God, who work right there with God. And what happens? What happens? They've got seven salpenges.
What? They've got seven salpenges? That sounds gross, bro. Is that, can you get rid of that with some antibiotic?
Look at this, salpings. What is a salpings? It's a war trumpet, baby. And look at the second line. You see where it says Tursenike? That's the Tursenike salpings.
This stuff goes back to the Etruscans, right? This is that instrument. Love it. They've got seven of them. Get me the next one. I was just having a vision, dude. I was seeing.
I was seeing stuff. And then what happens? We're down to verse three. And another angel came and he stood there on the Thusias daily, on that place where the voice of God comes from.
And what does he have? What does he have? Look at the next line, people. He has libanoton hrusun. Do you know what that is?
It's literally gold incense. It's gold incense. Oh my God. This is beautiful. And what's going to happen? It was given to him. Thumiamata. He was blessed with Thumiamata.
What are those things, people? Drugs. You know what this angel is carrying? This angel from the Apocalypse is carrying? He's carrying a fistful of drugs that will make you high.
And why? Why is he carrying these things? So he can give, right? So he can provide for the prayers of all of those holy. Yeah. So he can bring their power.
Because what do we do, people? Right? We're talking about an angel. Let's take it down for a minute. We're talking to think anthropology, right? He's got his hand full of that.
And I'm going to show you the drug in a minute. He is fumigating. He throws it down. He's fumigating. He's doing exactly what we do in the mystery cults.
You mean the book of the Apocalypse is based upon the activities of mystery cult? Yes. Yes, it is. And here's the angel getting us all high. Right in the opening. Let's go back there to that one.
Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh, God. And what is he doing? The smoke. Look at, look at verse four. Look at verse four. I think it's chapter eight, Apocalypse eight. And what is he did? What is kind on a behokapna? The smoke from all the Thumiyama, right? All of that incense.
What is a Thumiyama? It's the place that you burn that stuff, right? Okay. And what happens? That smoke is coming up, right? And that is those prayers. This is how we enter into it, people. This is us.
We're sitting there and our prayers as we're inhaling this psychotropic smoke are rising through the dimensions to the third and fourth, fifth heaven and beyond. This is us. You thought you knew what Christianity is, didn't you? No, you didn't. Right? And what happens? Look at, look at what happens with the drugs.
Okay. Elephant. Look at verse five. Okay. Elephant. The angel, the messenger. What did he do? He grabbed Mr. Stone Guy. He grabbed that libanoton. He grabbed that powdered frankincense combo. Yeah. Yeah. And he took off, combined a little bit of what was from the fire from over the Susia Stadium.
And he threw it on the ground. And what happened? What happens when he's doing this, kids? As we're watching this, what's happening? He's producing something. What is he producing? Chewie, bring it back. Same one. What is he producing?
He's producing. He's producing. He's producing the thunder and the lightning and the voices. Do you hear the voices? Do you hear the voices? Do you feel the earthquake? Do you feel the earthquake? Oh, take it down. Do you feel the earthquake? You will. You will.
When that servant of God, when that angel, how many among you, let me ask him this to be quiet for a minute, watchers. How many of you would use this capacity if you had it? How many of the sons of angels still inhabit this realm? Yes. Yes.
It's gorgeous, isn't it? It's amazing. When you consider Jesus with his naked boy, it's not, you know, hugely out of place. We'll get there, though. We're coming to Jesus as a naked kid. Keep going. Keep going. Next, next source. Yeah. I just want to show you people. This is the Lebanonos, the frankincense, right? Right? This is Lebanonos. Yeah, that's nice. But look at this. This is also frankincense.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And boom. Sacrifice. Oh, I thought I had the wrong image of it. It's okay. I was going to show you those thumiama. It comes from the Greek conception of what you do when you perform a sacrifice. You are completely consuming in fire these incense bits.
And one of the things that I wanted to show you with the... I'm going to show you in a second, but I'm going to show you with the frankincense that they're able to refine it down to a form that it most suits fumigations. And they call it manna. They call it manna. I thought manna. Hang on. Where's our Bible score? Come here. Come here. Come here. Yes, both of you. Both of you. I don't care.
None priest doesn't matter. Bible score, I don't care. Come here for a minute. Come here. Yep. You know the drill. It doesn't come from Hebrew. Do you mean the word manna? It doesn't come from Hebrew? No. No. As a matter of fact, it doesn't. It comes from a much, much older Greek tradition.
Of processing frankincense that you've imported from Arabia. Yeah. This is civilization, people. We are not backwoods anymore. Right? This is civilization. This is what we're fighting to maintain. Right? Manna. Do you mean manna is Greek and not Hebrew? Correct. Correct.
Next thing you're going to tell me again is Greek as well. Just hold on. Just hold on. Let's go back to the cult and get in with these party people. Give me this one. Where are we? Blow this up, people. I want you to see this.
Oh, God, you know what this is? This is a chorus. Giving you a shout out from a Bacchic groove. We've got a Bacchic song going. These people are stoned out of their minds. And what do they say? It's sweet. It's sweet to be in those forests. One of those mountains. Whenever you're doing your run around in your theosis. Right?
Now, these are women. These are women who are going to be saying this. These are mean ads. Do you women out there who think you're into extreme? Thank again. Thank again. Let me show you these women. If we could model these women, I would give my right something to bring these women back, to bring this chorus back.
So they say it's sweet to be in the forest. Whenever you've been running around that theosis, that dance, you fall to your feet. Boom, that thing is finished. You fall to your feet there. You're sitting there wearing your little fawn skin, your holy fawn skin.
Right? And what are you doing? You're sitting there hungry for the, for the what? For the goat blood death. The goat blood death. The sacrifice death. The tragedy. You knucklehead. We don't sacrifice goats. We sacrifice people.
That's the tragedy. That's the tragedy. Yeah. Okay. You're sitting around with that hunger. Bring me back. Bring me back. You've got that homophagy going. Do you know when you enter into these states and the mania is they describe
refer to increased ex-sexual ecstasy. Right? Accompanied by severe phobic psychosis. You get quite a creature when you bring that out. You know what I mean? Okay. And what happens here? Let's look at back of the text. So we're sitting around. Look, can you see them? They're all sitting. They're all hungry for the homophagy. It's their grace.
What does this sign say from your enemies? It says it's their heart and the right to eat the flesh, drink the blood is their grace. Does anybody smell those Christians? Not modern Christians. I'm talking ancient Christians because in Jesus and his boys,
because modern Christians are a shadow of an emptiness that is modern Christianity. It is an emptiness. It's a void. You people, can I just say, well, give me one moment, and this brings my goat that I have to, that I have to make such an announcement. It really gets my goat. Do you see those are the, that was the key word, right?
That was the key word, right? Chewie? Guess my goat. Right? Guess my exactly. Guess my goat. Yeah. Christianity. Just quick announcement. You are nothing today of what you were. Judaism. You are nothing today of what you were. Yeah. Yeah.
Isn't that amazing? The religions that we see practice today are not what their founders created. Isn't that amazing? Now we're going to look at one aspect of that. What are these people doing? They're touching me. They're touching me. Jesus wants to touch you too. Jesus wants to touch you too, especially if you're a little kid.
Jesus loves touching little kids and he's always yelling about not being scandalized. Let's go. Let's finish the Bacchus. Where are we at the Bacchus? Before we get to Jesus and the boys. Where are we at with the Bacchus? Here. Blow this up. Yeah. Look what's going to happen, people. You want more Christianity and Judaism? Do you want it? The land flows with milk and honey and wine.
You know the Greeks wouldn't leave that one. Milk and honey and wine. It's in all the sacrifices. You know that. Why do you think Moses is written as a character in the third century? Why do you think he's so big on the milk and honey? Because he's part of the right. That's what they're trying to put into a text. Wow. It's amazing. Watch what happens here.
