If you don't like it, it's not me.
It's the sources.
Let's go to the third one, the next one up.
Okay.
Here we get.
Look at the field throne.
I want you to notice on the bottom line, we have the same word here.
I'll just translate it for you.
This is when Jesus is talking to Peter and he's like, am I your favorite?
Who's your favorite?
What about your male prostitute, buddies?
He calls them male prostitutes?
Yup.
Male prostitutes.
Runaways who work with lace-dace.
Oh my God.
You're kidding.
Jesus is apostles?
His followers?
Yes.
Let's go back to that text.
What does it say?
When Jesus is giving Peter a hard time, what does Peter say to him?
He says, you know my friend, you know who I am.
Right?
You know what's going on.
You know what?
You know how I contributed to you.
The sweet love concoction that we aren't supposed to talk about.
Yup.
You gave him what, Peter?
How old are you?
And you gave him what?
You gave him that fieldtron?
The one that we're talking about with Aphrodite?
Oh my goodness.
Oh my good.
It's going to get worse people.
Just trust me.
Trust me.
Now by worse I mean it's going to get more graphic.
Right?
We're already at worse because it's, we got a ship full of kids in the Bible with Jesus
in a form that it can only be described as vampiric.
Having risen from the dead.
You knew it would be three days, right?
Yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
We got him.
We got him.
Next, next.
Give me.
Yeah.
Here.
I just want you to see this.
Take that.
Yeah.
Here's your love charm, your fieldtron.
Oh, tiny little space I have here.
Look at this.
Love charm, a potion, a charm or a spell.
But look at number three.
It becomes generalized.
It's just kind of loving.
It's just kind of loving.
Sexuality.
Look what kind of sexual affection I gave you, Jesus.
The kind that we don't talk about.
The unmentionable love, Jesus, that I gave to you.
So when we're in transdimensional court, the jury will hear the grooming.
This is professional grooming.
You didn't know Jesus was a child groomer, did you?
Well, now you know why he's screaming.
I'm not a laystace.
I'm not a trafficker in children.
Right?
Okay.
Let's keep going.
Let's go back to the text.
Yep.
There we go.
Here.
Look at this, people.
This is more of that same passage, but I just want to read it to you from the top.
Jesus answered.
He answered Peter right back with his own oomph and said, Simon, you're the child of John who has beautiful children.
Wait, what did Jesus say?
You're the child of John who has beautiful boys.
Yeah.
So tell me something.
Would you rather love me alone or all of your head Tyrone, who was homozygous?
Wait, all of his Tyrone, all of his companions, all of his prostitutes.
Hmm.
These boys are prostitutes.
These boys are prostitutes.
No, Ness.
Why?
Why didn't anybody tell me this in Bible school?
I wish I had known.
I wish I had known.
It makes a lot more sense, doesn't it?
You see them on the boat earlier and there's a storm.
They're all like screaming like children.
Jesus is sleeping down the bottom.
He's like, oh, you frigging people.
Right.
And he like a parent.
He brings calm.
He does what that magus does.
He had to tell him that he was doing that, right?
Calming the storm.
It's what they all do.
Okay.
Give me that same passage.
Give me that same passage.
Boom.
I want to.
Okay.
So he says, you know, and what is your homozygous?
Male prostitute buddies.
That's somebody that you're entered into a relationship
together, whether working or sexual.
So these are his buddies of the other apostles are Peter's
buddies who are in the trafficking business.
Now you're going to see it.
It becomes even more clear than, than this coming up.
So buckle up.
Hold on.
Are you ready?
Look at the next line.
Yeah.
And so he asks him a second time, right?
He responds to, he responds to Jesus, his bossy laos.
He does it again.
He responds to him again.
Cause he'd already told him once, I love you the most man.
Right.
And what does he say here?
Look at the line nine 94.
It says, I'm going to translate it literally.
It says Simon, the fisherman of male bands.
Male bands.
Agales is a band.
