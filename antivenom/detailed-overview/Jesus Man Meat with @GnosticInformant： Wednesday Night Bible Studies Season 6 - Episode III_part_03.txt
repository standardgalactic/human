All you lawyers out there, this is the one.
It's admissible and trans dimensional court.
And this is the one that has it.
Are you ready?
What's he going to do?
Jesus got some, some goodies for him, right?
And he's there on the beach and they're waking up in the morning.
One of them goes, oh my God, it's Christ.
And they jump out and Peter puts his pants on.
Right.
Right.
And there they are.
And Jesus says, like, dude, you guys don't have any fish sauce.
It's the clove rule way of saying fish, just a fish meal.
You guys don't.
You out there is fishermen and you didn't catch any fish.
You didn't catch any fish.
Good.
Look, he's got everything ready to cook up a nice meal.
He's got everything.
This is going to be a beach morning beach party.
But what does he say in that text that is so disturbing that we're going to get him
on?
Look at that third line.
First, he says, oh my kiddies, what does he call them?
It's gross, too.
Right.
It gets gross because he uses the diminutive with Peter's like, you love me so much.
Feed my sheepies.
What?
That's what he called his little boys.
He called him his sheepies.
It's not even sheep in Greek.
It's a diminutive.
My little sheep.
My little sheep.
Okay.
Are you one of Jesus's little sheep?
Is that what you are?
You want to know what those real sheep were in the beginning?
They were victims of abuse and rape.
Jesus was a child rapist.
Let's see.
Let's see what he said in that last.
Let's translate that one line.
Bring up one line.
What is it?
Woo.
There it is.
Pides.
He calls them children.
My little children.
What kind of children?
Dresteres.
Wait a minute.
That's like, what?
That's like a professional term.
What?
Something of the sea.
Some kind of here.
Alice, see if you can tell us Alice what that is.
Look, what is it?
Dresteres.
A labor working person.
Working woman.
But if you funnel it through didrosco.
It's the runaway.
The one attached to the lace days.
The lace days.
Do you see the word lace days?
All of you.
All of you evangelicals right now who were sitting there.
A spanking for you.
This is a spanking for you.
Look, it's right there.
Lace days.
All of you evangelicals are saying, it's a word for thief and that naked boy wasn't naked.
He was dead.
And he was 30.
Okay.
Do you know what gives me the ability to do that?
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
Do you know what gives me the ability to do that?
Classical philology.
The language.
The boys are coworkers.
They have a shared monetary interest.
They are gaming from their association with Jesus.
And you wonder why when he's arrested with a naked kid again, why it is that everybody's
saying, what Jesus?
What?
You're not a who?
You're not a lace dace.
Okay.
Okay.
And then a mob forms.
Angry mob.
Angry mob.
And Jesus' worst nightmare comes true.
His cover is blown.
Jesus is Larry Nasser.
As soon as somebody comes forward and says something.
That's it.
You live by silence.
There are those of you who have ears to hear because Jesus has groomed you and has initiated
you.
Yeah.
You wondered what he needed to marry with all our sex drugs.
Did you think that Jesus was in any business other than child sex trade?
You have another thing coming.
Love it.
Let's go to the next text.
Okay.
Look, I've got just a couple.
Look, these are nice little punctuation marks.
Boom.
Look at this.
This is John 21-16.
Yeah, he says to him again a second time.
Simon, son of John, do you love me?
And he says back to him, yeah, Lord, you know that I love you.
And he says back to him, then shepherd my probatea.
Oh, God, it's so gross when you hear it off his lips.
You know, little sheepies.
Yeah.
It's disgusting.
Give me the next one.
Look, look what he calls it.
This is the Bible, by the way.
For those of you, that's the Bible.
Right?
Here's more of the Bible.
What does he call them in John?
Paidea.
Look at that second line.
