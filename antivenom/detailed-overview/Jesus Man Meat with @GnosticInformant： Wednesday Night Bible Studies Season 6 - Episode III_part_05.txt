Where's the one that's leaning?
Do we have any leaners?
No.
Is it on the line?
I can't tell.
I was hoping to find the leaner.
We don't see the kid there where he's not there.
Da Vinci, you're excused.
Okay.
But you're going to have to supply like a 10 to 12 year old kid and have him leaning
against Jesus while they're having their banquet.
Right.
And the two other kiddies who were children of Martha.
Yeah.
No, Salome.
They were children of Salome.
They said, hey, you're going to talk us into being able to sit next to Jesus, mommy.
You wonder why the parents complained.
You wondered.
Right.
Some of them do and some of them don't.
Right.
Some of them like the grooming.
It's all part of the pizzazz.
Right.
You're going to be in the kingdom of heaven.
This is lovely.
What a lovely freak show this is.
Let's go.
Let's go to that last.
Yep.
Okay.
You're a Sunim Poros.
What is the kid to Jesus?
He's this.
Are you ready?
You're going to, don't be shocked.
Don't be shocked.
He's a fellow traveler companion.
No, he's not that.
Look at number two.
Look at number two.
A partner with him for gain.
Right.
This is his traveling boy.
Do you know what you can do?
What is the street value of a boy?
The one that Jesus is prostituting.
What's the street value of that?
You know, he does give him a home.
Right.
He's like, Hey kid, stay with mom.
I'm so thirsty.
Sorry.
That's what the text says.
Okay.
And by the way, and Johnny does end up drinking it.
So, you know, he's, he's whacked.
Let's go to one more.
Please.
Let's just go.
Is there any of this?
It's good.
Oh, lucky.
People are love this.
I know.
Thanks for waiting, Neil.
Wait just five more minutes.
I'll finish up.
Let's see.
Go bring me that one.
Yeah.
Here.
This is John 21 four.
And so early in the morning, I just wanted you to see early in the morning.
This is in the boat, right?
And Jesus standing there on the shoreline, right?
And so are these little students, right?
These little students, they don't recognize them because they're on the boat.
They don't recognize me.
Stand on the shore.
Okay.
Yeah.
And what happens?
Jesus says them.
Hey, kiddos.
Spidey, uh, right?
You got nothing to eat, right?
And they asked him, no, we're hungry.
Why?
And here he comes.
What's going to happen then?
Well, look at this.
Simon on the second line.
Simon Peter there for it when he heard that he was Jesus.
He wrapped himself in some clothing because he was naked.
And Gargumnos, right?
On a boat offshore with a bunch of boys.
Okay.
And now I want you to see how historically difficult this has been to translate because
people don't want to talk about what he's doing naked boys, right?
Or what he's doing naked with the boys.
So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on parentheses.
The parentheses do not exist in that text for he was stripped for work.
Oh, I see.
Uh, yeah, I get naked when I fish too.
Right.
I, and when I fall asleep after I've been fishing and haven't caught anything, I naturally
just fall asleep naked because that's what I've been doing all night.
Naked fishing.
I'm going to go fish.
Take it down.
I'm going to go fish naked with Jesus.
Do you see how he was groomed?
Do you see how Peter's groomed?
I don't know how, whether I should feel bad for him or whether I should say, hey, dude,
you're propping up some bad stuff.
Right.
You need to go to the authorities.
Well, you know, they did.
They got him and Peter ran away.
Did you wonder?
Everybody ran, dude.
Everybody ran.
I am not a lace.
I'm not a child trafficker.
Right.
Over and over again, that lace stays is a child trafficker.
Fantastic.
And I know that there are evangelicals among you.
Oh, I want it to be so much the robber.
It's not.
Isn't it?
Sorry.
These are all children.
Yeah.
These are all children.
Go back to the.
Yep.
Go for it.
And here's another translation.
He wrapped his outer garment around him for he had taken it off.
Okay.
So let me get this.
