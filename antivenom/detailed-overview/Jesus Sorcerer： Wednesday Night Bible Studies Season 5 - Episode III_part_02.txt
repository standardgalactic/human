Just don't forget that phthalophonin is fatal to all quadrupeds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On the application of the root to the genitals.
Why did I throw that in there?
Why did I throw that in there?
Because we are applying drugs.
We are applying drugs.
Did you know the Bible was so sexy?
No, you didn't.
Go back to Moses.
Get us back to that text from the very beginning.
It's up.
Yeah, there we go.
Yeah.
Okay.
So what does he say?
That's, hey, dos matats, these aromatics, right?
And now he's going to list for you what those are.
He gives you, he gives you the recipe.
This is the holy recipe.
It's the holy recipe.
Here it comes.
To anthos smutines.
Yeah.
Well, it's got myrrh in it.
We know that smurna at least, right?
And give us smurna.
It's the first Greek up there.
Yeah.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Sometimes it's written smurna.
Nice.
Nice.
But it's mura.
We know that.
See, it's that Arabian tree.
Right.
Myrrh.
We've got no problem there.
But look, it's used in, if you can go halfway down that paragraph,
and not YouTube, the audience, if you look halfway down that paragraph,
down to the Greek word.
Atmidzon purismurnes.
Yeah.
Hupothumie.
That's what that thing is.
It's hupothumie.
Yeah.
What are those?
Let's go back to the Greek.
Those are fumigations, bro.
There's fumigations.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
That's okay.
Go back to the text.
Excellent.
So we've got some smurna there.
And what else do we have?
It gives a weight of it.
Who cares?
And then so much kinamomon.
You can probably pick that one out.
That's just cinnamon, bro.
It's just cinnamon, bro.
What do you do with your cinnamon?
You get the stuff that's eodus.
You get the stuff that smells awesome.
The good smelling stuff.
You mean there's different times?
Yeah.
You get the really, really good stuff.
That's the reserve, the special.
Go back to that text.
We're reading the Bible.
We're reading the Bible.
What else is in this substance?
By the way, we're going to take this substance.
We're going to cover everything with it.
We're going to cover boys with it.
We're going to cover candlesticks with it.
We're going to cover altars with it.
The whole place is going to stink of this stuff.
So it's important to see what it is that we're using in our drug.
And someone's alleging that we're using cannabis.
Let's keep reading the verse, but so far I don't see it.
Okay.
What else do we have here?
We have half as much, right?
And what?
Calamu.
Oh, Calamu eodus.
Calamus.
Fragrant Calamus.
You know, the kind that is not cannabis.
Okay.
Now, where's the mistake that's written there in English that we didn't notice?
Go back to it.
I know this is flips, but go back to that first, uh, second slide that we had.
Second slide.
