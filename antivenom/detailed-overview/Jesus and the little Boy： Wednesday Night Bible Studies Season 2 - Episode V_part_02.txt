It's not, things are not so bad
Right, we have to understand here
That we can get rid of the religiosity
But we can't get rid of that core
Let's look at the core
I have no arguments for you
I have no opinions, I have no...
You can quote me as saying nothing
That thou shouldst do or not do anything
Yeah, here we serve the text baby
This is the museum, we serve the text
Let's look at what that text says
John, bring him up
Excellent, thank you so much
Ape'olthon es ta'opiso
kai epesan jamai
Yeah, so they said, are you Jesus?
He said, I am
And it says they went around to his back
They circled him
They went around him so he couldn't get away
And epesan jamai, they fell on him
They attacked, the Greek uses this for falling all the time
All the time, one enemy falls upon another
So they surround him and they take him
They start to arrest him
They grab him, right
And as they're going for him, Jesus says
Let's go to the next text
This is the one from Mark
Yeah, so they're around him
And they're getting...
The arrest is being made
They've identified who he is
And they're taking him down
And what happens?
Jesus responds to them, right
As they're coming on to him
He says, what have you come out here?
With your swords and with your clubs?
That's a military club, right?
It's a big thing
That's a big deal
They came out with battering rams this time
And flash grenades, right?
They came out and what did they say?
Look at the end of the first line, haus
Haus, look at the two first words in the next line
Ape'olthon es ta'opiso
Take it down
You're coming at me as if
You're coming against
Or coming to arrest
Or coming to apprehend
A lacedace
What is that?
What is that?
People like to translate it as robber
Robber
But that doesn't make it
That doesn't quite make it there
Jesus says, where are you guys so heavily armed for?
What did you come out against me for?
You know, would you look at your armed resistance?
Would you come out?
Let's look at the translate
Look at the...
There we go
Here's the definition of lacedace, right?
It's from Leidzo
For those of you who are in Greek, right?
Good
And notice that
They first give you robber or pirate
And you thank yourself, wait a minute
Pirate?
Jesus is saying, what's your guys
