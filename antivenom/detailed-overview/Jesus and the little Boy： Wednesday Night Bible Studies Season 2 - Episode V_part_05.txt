Okay
So if I got this straight
The fairytale view is
Jesus set off a glory bomb
The soldiers hit the deck
And because they were close
To a fresh dead boy
He crawled out of the grave
I mean, this is zombies
Does anybody else see this as zombies?
This man believes in zombies
Out comes this boy
Fantastic. Let's hit him one more time
This is just, it's overwhelming
It's overwhelmingly bad
When this man takes you into the back
Okay, and he starts this act
Right?
You don't know that his Greek is wrong
It is
Plainly, openly
Yes, okay
Let's finish him off
That was another miracle
A periphery resurrection
And when the soldiers and the religious leaders
Saw the resurrected boy
They said, somebody get that boy
Because they didn't want news
Of another resurrection
In that very moment
Jesus' power is simply immense
It shows up all the time
And today, I want to talk to you about
Jesus' power showing up in your life
Yeah, and that's how it starts
That's how it starts
Show me on the dolly
Yeah, that's how it starts
Did you hear how he's going in there
And in for the...
He's going in
This is the hunt, right?
He's praying on you
And he's going to come in
I want to show you Jesus' power
Wait a minute
You just made up
A bunch of nonsense
Right?
Even what he said about the scene down
Right?
It is not a burial shroud
It is not the word for burial shroud
It's the word for linen strip
It's just a piece of linen cloth
That's all
It's a piece of linen cloth
Yeah, and if this guy
Had had five minutes
To read some Galen
He might see how these linen bandages work
Yeah
Yeah, the kid runs off naked
Jesus is calling himself
A child sex trafficker
The people that show up
Oh, by the way
For those of you who want a little more context
By the way, with the child sex trafficking
In antiquity
There we go
With the child sex trafficking in antiquity
Sometimes it can get kind of formalized
And when the pirates show up
You have a certain number of
Teens that they need to be given
