Yeah, and that keeps them from coming back
They only come back once a year
Right?
And the mothers in antiquity
Are singing about these things
Yeah, about how terrible it is
To be taken in those captives
And to have your child ripped from you
In order to enter into this
Garden of delight
Where these kids are sold off
Yeah, it's a big
Abduction
And abduction for the purposes of sexual abuse
Is a very prominent industry
In antiquity
So when Jesus calls himself
A trafficker
He's noticing as you see
He's clearly pointing out
You've got the weapons
Right?
You brought the specialized unit
Right?
And this guy says 600
Right?
Because he thinks when the Greek says
He went to the cohort
He thinks he got every person in the unit
Right?
No
He didn't
Right?
And they didn't fall down
Because of the glory bomb
Don't we have some...
Look, we tried to make a
Representation of this thing
Hit it, Chewie
I don't think it works
Let's just call it
You've got my hands
When we have the chance
That's enough
Fantastic
I don't know if that captured it
I don't know if that captured it
And before we move on to our serious ending
I do need a moment of subliminal zane
Do you have just a moment of subliminal zane?
There we go
Fantastic
You can check that out later
The...
By the way, thank you, Zane
For the contribution of all your music
I hope you like what I'm doing with it
Thank you very much
What do we do with that glory bomb?
Alright, so we're in a situation now
Look, guys, we have an option
We can't...
I can't keep taking you back to these scenes
And exposing you to them
Without it seriously affecting us all
Right?
So we have to understand
We have to get it clear
That we are talking about a time
And a place and very specific things
Very specific historical events
And the only thing that we can trust
Is the language
The language preserves this
The language preserves what the actual statement was
That Jesus made
He said, you're arresting me
