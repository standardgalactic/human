There's a lovely, there's some lovely imagery there
And some talk of what you can do with your daughters
You can dedicate your daughters to the temple
And they'll be protected
And we as members of the community
Who worship Hecatee and protect those virgins
We take up weapons, stones, bows
Against those pirates
Who we catch with our children naked
It turns out
The chief pirate
Is the son of God
Get your hands off him
Parents were saying
Get your hands off him
All right
Stop touching my children
It's what people told Jesus
He was like, don't scandalize me
Yeah
Maybe that's what it is
When the priest is
I just want to finish with Gatier
When the priest
At his ordination
Sees the vampirist
And knows the beauty
He gains a perspective
And he can never go back
His God's righteousness
Turns into oppressive pain
Yeah
Because he's seen her
And he knows
Yeah
Gatier
Thank you
Tonight
I've taken up 30 minutes of your time
And I believe that that's all the time
That I will take up tonight
I want to make an announcement
Before we go
I want to make an announcement
That Friday
We will be having
Our fight club
Where only the sons of Heracles
Will be allowed to enter
I've told Chewie
You don't get in without your wig
And your Victoria's secret
We should bleep that out
Should I not?
Yeah
Here he is
Heracles
You love him
You love his gown
Look, there's the queen
There's the queen
There she is
So you don't get into the fights
Unless you come
In proper kit
And we will be taking
The movement that we've been
The forward motion that we've been accumulating
We're going to take that
We're going to drive that into the form
Of the practicing
The working of the mystery
Yeah, we're going to expose
Expose that to people
So that they can see
Right, let's get back in the ship
This is enough, I guess, isn't it, right?
