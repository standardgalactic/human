It's a plant grass, right?
Poa.
It's a paw with a soon weargoss.
What is that?
That's old.
That's old terminology, baby.
What is that?
It's a power to create something, to bring about a change.
What's that change directed at?
Directed at your hormones, baby.
We're going to give you some aphrodisiac.
We're going to give you some aphrodisiac.
That's what Ceterion is.
Ceterion, very well known ancient drug.
So look at this.
Hesechius, he's tracking the drugs too because these are esoteric.
These are technical terms, right?
Remember, there's 50,000 of these technical terms.
And just in Alpha alone, just in Alpha alone, there's 9,000.
That's 1,000 more in one letter than Hebrew.
Ancient Hebrew has of all its words.
That's 1,000 more.
And by the way, with the Hebrew, it's 8,000.
And again, this is ancient Hebrew, which is a fabrication.
Modern Hebrew, thriving.
Thriving.
There are like 60,000 somewhere in that range.
I've seen higher estimations that it's an engine.
This ancient stuff, it's not an engine.
And it turns out 2,000 of those words, 2,000 of those 8,000 are names.
They're proper names.
You can't count those.
That's not unique words.
Oh, God.
So it went down to 6,000 now.
I'm telling you, if we can get through breakfast with that language.
Oh, God, don't worry about it.
You know what it is?
It's a beauty contest.
Linguistic history.
I'm giving you this one tonight because we're on a date.
We're on a date and I love it.
Linguistic history is beauty contest.
It's beauty contest.
Oh, God, where's that golden apple?
We're giving it to grace.
We're giving it to that Greek language that came up with so much beauty.
You know what that word barbarian means?
You know what that word barbarian means?
It means somebody who's paratonic.
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
You can hear it.
They're describing people based upon their language.
This is so unique.
It's so unique.
There's a musicality to the language and it's not just meter.
It's a real power.
It's a musical power.
Oh, God.
Okay, let's go.
I love it.
People look.
Let's blow everybody.
Joey, let's blow everybody's mind and bring them the sources.
Anything they see.
Okay.
Be careful for everybody who is here, who is, you know, needs a PG script.
The Saturoi.
What are they?
They're the forms that are indecent.
These are the obscene bits.
You know what I'm talking about because in our religion, people, when we walk into a
temple of the muse, what do we find?
Somebody asked me just recently.
They said, what is the word?
What's this temple of the muse thing?
He said, look, we've got the very heart and center is the beating heart of the museum,
the place where the muse is worshiped.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Get ready for your inappropriate bits because in the center of this temple to the muse,
the Pythagoras says you can't start a civilization without in the heart.
What's in the heart of her temple, Chewie?
It's a big phallus.
It's a phallus of Bacchus.
Don't you know that this is where we start.
Those Athenians were into the snake venoms.
Oh God, those Pulaskians.
Did we forget about Pulaskians?
Neil, tell us about the Pulaskians.
Go to the next one.
We need to get through these.
You know, this is a quick trip.
Quick trip.
Look at this, people.
I'm going to introduce you to something.
Welcome.
Watch the Pulaski and come through the language.
Are you ready?
Here's the dictionary.
You ready?
Sa-o-kis.
Sa-o-kis.
Sa-o-kis.
He-sa-mo-thra-ke.
Hudo-se-kale-to.
To-prote-ron.
This is how they used to call Samothrace.
The island, they used to call it what?
Sa-o-kis.
Oh, fantastic.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Who were those original inhabitants of Samothrace?
Who were those Atokhthonoi?
Who were those Atokhthonis people?
Were they?
They were Pulaskians.
They were part of that Calculithic horse culture.
Their name was all about, you guessed it, purple.
Purple.
Really?
It's all about purple?
Yeah.
It's all about purple.
Show us.
We're going to see the purple.
We're going to bring you the purple.
Are you ready?
Now, they just brought it in England.
Thanks.
The Newcastle was one of the universities, by the way.
They was involved with that.
And I just want to say, I had a lovely time at Newcastle.
I gave a paper there, and I was sitting in the lobby
and enrushed a group of prostitutes who embraced me,
cheered me up, pinched my cheeks, called me some names.
I thought for sure.
One of them said, Governor.
Oh, it was God.
It was lovely.
Newcastle.
Thumbs up.
Thumbs up, Newcastle.
Loved it.
Beautiful experience.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
Ta-da.
Oh, here it is.
You want to know?
No.
No.
Was the one before that?
No.
Yeah.
We need to.
Oh, God.
Who, by the way, the salvation that we're just looking at,
the salvation of sauce.
Who is sauce, this old divinity?
Who is this?
It's Helios.
And for the wait, don't take it down to you.
And for those of you who don't recognize,
that is the great, the great son,
the grandfather of the Medewa.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Let's see.
Where are we, people?
Look at the second word, Babylonian.
You people.
We ended up in Babylon tonight.
Doesn't that have fun with the queen of Babylon?
And who is ruling?
It's Helios.
Right?
It's Helios in his line that is ruling.
And the Medewa is directly in the line.
She's the virgin who breathed the fire.
And she only got that way because she figured it out.
Brilliant.
It's pure brilliance.
The first Christ was a Bronze Age woman named
Matia, who lived in Colchis.
Oh, God.
And rule Babylon.
Can you believe that?
That's gorgeous.
Good.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
Brilliant mind.
Totally disregarded.
When they threw out all the female authors,
they lost a lot.
They lost a lot.
They lost all the keys.
Go for it.
Hit us with it.
What is our salvation?
Those of you who have been intrepid and gone to Bible school,
and by the way,
I'm not going to give you the website yet for AmenU.
Still coming up.
Still coming up.
Pardon me.
Still coming up.
But for those of you who have been inquiring, right?
Wait.
Wait.
Hopefully next Friday.
Hopefully it's up by next Friday.
Thank you for your patience.
I want everybody.
We want to facilitate this in a way that anybody who wants to enlist,
can enlist.
Oh, God.
What is sotaria?
It's salvation.
And look.
Look at the word that we have.
It's saotaria.
Right?
Where does salvation come from?
It comes from saos.
It comes from saos.
You mean it doesn't come from Jesus?
No.
There was no Jesus then.
There was no Jehovah then.
Yeah, we're talking about there was no Pharaoh.
There were no Egyptians, bro.
We're talking about the old stuff.
We're talking about the old stuff.
Now I know the purple was announced and prophesied of and now has arrived.
Oh, guess what's coming?
Guess what's coming?
Oh, you're going to love this.
Go to the next.
Go to the next one, Gnostic.
Thanks for popping in.
I will be there shortly, sir.
Give us the next one.
I want you to absorb.
Now I want you to sit back and absorb some of this.
What are some of the other terms that I want you to notice as we are walking among the cult?
Right?
And as we know, Lady Babylon, what are some of the, look, we've got forms of drugs.
Here's one.
Akinite.
And here's the old name for it.
Sadomostis.
Give you the next one.
Akinite.
What's Akinite?
Didn't I see that?
Where's that?
Didn't I?
Give me the Akinite.
Do you have a picture of the Akinite?
Oh, we didn't bring Akinite with us tonight.
Oh, look at the loveliness of the Akinite.
What does it do to you?
It's a cardio.
Go ahead.
Take that.
It's a cardio toxin and a neurotoxin.
Both.
And you know what's funny?
Wolfsbane.
Right?
Yeah.
The leucophon.
Right?
That wolf killer.
Oh, it's a cardio.
Just can kill you.
Terrible.
