death inducer with the antidote.
Salvation.
Salvation.
That's how you get born again.
That's how you get born again.
Give us the next one.
Boom.
Joey, we got to go galaxy to galaxy tonight.
Watch this.
What are the drugs?
They're awesome.
Make on us.
You know, this is the one that gives you the lethy.
Are you guys ready to induce some lethy?
Wait a minute.
What is this?
Opium?
Yeah, it's opium.
Now remember, it's not a cedulated morphine.
It's not heroin.
It's opium.
Yeah.
And everybody's on it.
Everybody who's anybody is on it.
Why?
Because when you pair it with the theriac, the negative effects are ameliorated and the
positive effects of that opium off the charts.
You know the Romans grow opium?
The great poet Virgil describes how to grow it best.
Right?
How do you raise those poppies?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
Let's go on to the next one.
On the heat.
They're going to say, he's promoting.
No, I'm not promoting anything.
I'm giving you the history.
Watch.
What is a selates?
That's another.
That's another kind of odd term for cochleas.
We're defining it through the Greek.
Look at the mastery.
We're not using English intermediary.
We're using the ancient Greeks telling you what it means.
What is that cochleas?
That is our little mollusk.
That's our shell, our little spiral shell that has a little mollusk that we get the purple
from.
Give me the next one.
We're going to fly here.
Oh, get that out of here.
That just causes lethy.
Look, more opium.
Put all that opium in there.
Here's an expression.
Here's an expression.
Right?
Colloquial.
Semna te se sparteno musteria.
That's that.
A holy mystery of your virgin.
Do you understand what the holy mystery of your virgin is?
No, of course you don't.
None of none of we don't understand that.
You haven't been initiated, bro.
Look at the Sophocles told us.
These are the things that you cannot speak.
You cannot explain the mysteries.
You cannot explain the mysteries.
That's what this is.
The holy, the holy mysteries of your virgin.
Yes, they're areta.
They're inexplicable.
Yeah, unspeakable.
Right?
Keep your mouth shut.
I don't know if you love it.
It's an interesting perspective, no?
Yes, sacred virgin, man.
Who are these?
What are these?
Ce se loi.
Oh, they're cochleae.
They are these mollusks, right?
That are we're going to be carvesting the purple from.
And this name, Ce se loi, that's just the name the Lacones use.
Those are who the Laconians.
Those are the Spartans, baby.
Those are Spartans.
Those are those wolf worshiping Spartans.
Don't you love them?
Those people are crazy, dude.
This stuff is starting in Athens.
Athens with the Athena.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You want a meter?
Are you ready?
Hit the next one.
Hit the next one.
Far macones.
Far macones.
Tabafaea.
When I boptoe, I die something.
I die something.
You mean the word baptism?
Baptism is from a drug industry?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
These drugs, like the burning purple, these drugs will be used in ceremonies that are prevalent
in certain groups of people.
And by that, I mean certain strata of society, and they always float to the top.
That's why people are saying, this stuff is more valuable than gold.
Right?
More valuable than gold.
Take your understanding of the material and shove it.
This is musteria.
You don't even realize what kind of gunpowder you're sitting on.
Oh, God.
I love it.
Let's go to the next one.
This is gorgeous.
This is going to give us everything.
What is that?
That's the Kalkian.
That's the person, right?
The Kalkian, the city, Kalkis.
And you can call the woman, Medea, the Medewa.
You can call her Kalkis.
That's what they call her.
But what is, I've got to, I've got to give me, you can go to that one, but give me the
next one, because these two are paired.
Look at this.
Kalkos.
What is it really coming from?
This little spiral creature that they take, the murex, it's called, they take it.
It's got a little secretion.
I've seen it described as mucus collected, and they have to process it, right?
Okay.
Look, this is, Kalkos is Kalkos.
It is that shell.
This is the place where they're working, the purple, and her name means purple.
Her name means purple.
This is a big deal.
The first word out of the library of Herculaneum was purple.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Oh, let's keep going, Chewie.
We've got, we started a little bit late.
So who are the Seikoloi?
Those are the Leistai.
Wait, what?
Did he say, sounded like Leistais to me.
Remember Jesus is yelling in the Garden of Gethsemane.
I'm not Leistais.
Why'd you come out with the big weapons?
Right?
What are the Seikoloi?
They're Leistai.
They're Leistai.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Love it.
These are the child traffickers, right?
Well, okay.
What do the Seikoloi do?
What are the Seikoloi?
This is what the Seikoloi, traffic in.
They traffic in Heitamia, Paedisci.
And then you can see the root, the last word Paedisci.
You know what that is?
That is an underage prostitute, female.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Slave.
The word slave is there.
And it's the word for the slave that is attached to.
It's attached to a household or the functioning of some kind of, you know, operation.
Let's keep going.
Now, for those of you and people keep, because look, nobody in Bible studies.
I'll get to you.
I'll give you a second to give some good brainwashing.
Nobody in Bible studies will know this.
This is why classes laugh at them.
Nobody in Bible studies reads the lexicon of Hissechias, right?
Nobody does.
It's a shame.
But, and that's why I get email from people who say the silly things they say.
Oh, it's just a robber.
It's just a robber.
Me, me, me, me.
It's just a robber.
No.
You have no concept of what you're talking about because you have no access to the language.
You have not embraced Mother Greek.
Your brain will not grow and you will never know the way.
Yeah.
Because you have some sort of offense.
The great mother.
Great doesn't want to have anything to do with you.
For those of you who want to have something to do with this ancient Greek, this incredible,
can you believe this is 50,000 unusual words?
50,000.
Oh, my God.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
It's so, it's glorious and it's mastery.
It's glorious.
And I'm humbled every time.
Every time I'm humbled.
Whenever I gave a paper in classics, I was like, oh, Muse, let me handle this in proper
way, man.
This is hot, hot nuclear, radioactive.
Give me the next one.
Boom.
What is this?
Oh, let's all get enthusiastic, right?
Right?
These are meonians.
I think that's out of order.
I don't think that was the last one, Chewie, because there was a lead up to that.
Let's go back a little bit.
What does that say?
Boom.
Right there.
Put that one up.
Yeah.
So these are the young, these are the young prostitutes that are being trafficked.
Right?
By the lace dye.
Okay.
Give me the next one.
Yeah.
And that hints the connection back.
Thank you, Chewie.
To the sake of low eye.
Right?
That's what we're doing.
Remember that early Greek history is a history of marauding abduction and sales, cruel sales
of humanity.
Yeah.
And the story of Odysseus is the story of a dude who wanders from island to island being
pursued by women who turn him into a drug using sex slave.
Yeah.
Can you believe that?
People are like, oh, I don't distinguish.
Did I read the Odyssey?
No, you're reading about a crazy, but brilliant, but brilliant age where a knowledge of drugs
was particularly coming to a crescendo.
Give me the next one.
Oh God.
It's so lovely.
Let's keep going through these words.
Watch this view.
This is just to act enthusiastic, right?
But I want to, I want you to see the Lydian connection.
Let's hurry up.
This is enthusiasm.
What happens when you become enthusiastic people?
Where are we trying to get in that bronze age civilization?
Where are we trying to get?
We're trying to get possessed by God.
Has anybody been possessed by a God?
No.
I'm going to ask you that very carefully.
Have you been possessed by a God?
That's all I want.
I just, if you and I are sitting here across from each other, my question is, have you
been possessed by a God?
Now if you answer that and you are a monist, then you are not practicing your religion
in accordance with its original practitioners.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Possession.
Next one.
That's where we're going, right?
The oracles.
Don't forget the oracles.
