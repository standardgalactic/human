They're all possessed.
They're all possessed.
Why do you think the trafficking has to do with a bunch of Pidey sky?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how the demon is drawn.
That's how the demon is drawn.
Oh, isn't that interesting?
Interesting.
Now, due to the worship of Athena, we guard that virgin.
Yeah.
Isn't that something?
Right?
It's law.
Let's go to the next one.
I know many of you are not worshipers of the great mother, but it's the law.
She sets it up right here.
It is.
That's just more.
I want you to see that my route.
Why?
Because we're talking really about Maya.
You mean we're talking about Maya when we talk about entering ecstasy?
Entering ecstasy?
Yes.
Why?
Because the purple is what gives us the birth.
The purple is what brings that child into this world.
This is that powerful midwifery that is the high tech of the Bronze Age.
It's the high tech.
And Maya is that woman who has that purple tech.
Yeah.
Has that purple tech.
She's the only one who stayed on earth.
Did you notice that?
She's the only one.
I prefer the caves.
Love it.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Why is that?
Maya is right.
Get the next one.
What is this?
My Masasa.
My Masasa.
What are we doing with Maya's route?
We're turning her into Oistresasa.
How do we get to the estrus?
How do we get to the oistris?
How do we get to that place of Mania?
We get there through she who has the purple.
It's a biological scientific chemical thing.
You can't lie.
Chemicals don't lie.
They make excellent evidence.
Let's go to the next one.
Are you ready?
We're with her.
We're with her, right?
Look, here's Maya.
What's Maya?
I want you to notice down at the bottom, she is that nurse.
She's also that one who, that doctor.
I just want you to look at the last word in the sentence, yatros.
That is indicating a physician.
She's the woman's physician, the physician who brings about life.
It's a great physician, Maya.
Here's, wait a minute, Mary Magdalene, how did she get here?
Look at the second line.
Look at the second line.
What's Jesus doing with the Magdalene?
He's casting out the Dymonia.
Next one?
Next one?
Where did we get a Magdalene in all of this?
The Bible scholars will tell you that Magdalene, and this is everybody, okay, you can go onto
any of the sites that you want YouTube, any of them, guarantee you, they're going to say,
Magdalene, is it a maic?
Probably Aramaic.
Do you think so, Bob?
Bob, do you think so?
Aramaic, Bob?
How can I hear a Hebrew?
Somebody's going to say it's Hebrew, right?
You get a whole chorus of religious girls from Hebrew.
It's from Aramaic.
No.
No, it's not.
Ezekius shows us.
It's from Greek.
And what does it mean when Ezekius defines it?
What does he talk about?
He talks about those who shave the head and offer the oral.
Shame on you all for not knowing.
Shame on you all.
Hit the next one.
I love the Gnostic.
I love to step on.
I love to step on Gnostic Magdalene followers.
Remember, Galen says it's an antidote, right?
She is an antidote.
The Sotera is an antidote.
Keep going.
Just wanted to focus, refocus people on that one.
That's why I brought it up.
Here's the Magdal.
Here's the Magdal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Bringing you the oral.
Okay.
That's exactly what it says right now.
It can be translated as to eat or to devour.
Yeah.
To swallow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shaved head.
Why shave?
Why are these people shaving?
For those of you who have been to the Cypriot rites of Adonis, remember, Bacchus always
leads us to Aphrodite, you know, where she sits.
She sits on Cyprus.
She sits on Cyprus.
Oh yeah.
Shave the head.
Shave the head.
Stay with your, stay with your mate.
Is he worthy of it?
I don't know.
How many of you ask that same question?
Well, back then they were saying things like, I don't know, you can give them some of that
poison.
You know what I mean?
Technically.
These are groups of horse marauders.
Right?
Very well fit people, just, you know, healthy, vigorous, smartest.
Oh my God, the drug, the drug knowledge that's coming out of these people is fascinating.
They're using each other.
Oh my God.
They're using each other for drug sources.
Oh God.
Hit the next one.
Let's keep going.
We can't get too far from the Bacchus stuff.
Remember people, here's Ezekius with all of his definitions of these technical terms.
They're involved with the worship of Bacchus.
I want you to see the very bottom one.
Just look at the bottom one.
What is Bacchia?
What is Bacchia?
It's mania.
It's insanity.
Do you wonder why at Menorca they had the hair with the, with the paint in it that would
cause the insanity?
Because these are combos.
When you take that Akinite, you take that Thannasemon, that Deathbringer, and you add
to it the Theriac.
Are you ready?
I'm going to show you linguistically where the Theriac comes from.
Where the beast upon which Lady Babylon is born.
I'm going to show you that, isn't that a lovely position?
Born up, born up by the beast, the Theriac and the Death Enducer.
I'm going to give you the name tonight.
You're so lucky.
You're so lucky.
I'm telling you, Satanic congregation, I'm telling you, you're so, you will not get
this elsewhere.
You will not.
And I hope that you will see the incredible power of these sources.
I want you to hear the dead, smell the dead, make love to the dead.
Let's do that now.
Is that what these drugs do?
Watch.
He's going to say that in the definition.
Go.
The next one.
Oh, what do we do?
Somebody raised a shout to Pion.
Pion.
Every.
Wait.
Who?
Who?
Who?
That's PN.
Right?
That's a song.
Oh, right.
Song coming.
I hear the chorus coming.
This is Apollo.
Somebody say, Hallelujah.
That's what that says in Greek.
Allelok, Santis.
You darn straight.
Give me the next one.
Hallelujah.
I thought somebody's going to say Hebrew.
Come here.
Come here.
You guy who says that's Hebrew.
Here is an ancient lexicon that shows you to have serious problems.
Bring us the soteriakon.
What is the soteriakon?
Remember the Theriakon?
You remember the Theriakon?
That is the beast that you combine with the death inducer.
And here, they have put on the front of it, souse, souse.
This is from the line of Helios.
Those are the people who are historically bringing you the burning purple.
And what does it do?
And what does it do?
Well, look at these.
You hang on.
Bring it back to me.
And then we'll look at these partiers.
They have an exercise program.
What's going on with that?
Let's go to the next one.
I mean, to the one that was before.
Give me.
They didn't know after that.
Boom.
Look at this people on that soteriakon.
Remember that soteriakon is the savioress.
The first savior, she, who is the savior.
What is the soteriakon or the Theriakon?
What is it for?
It's for the ekforah of the dead.
It is given for the sake of the ekforah of the dead.
What is the ekforah?
That's when you and I sneak out into a cemetery.
We dig down and we get great, great grandpa, we pull him out and we look at him in the
face and we see grandpa speak to me, speak to me grandpa, and grandpa comes to life.
This is the resurrection of the dead that you're watching.
You want to know why Christianity is centered around resurrection because it's this mystery
right and you're watching it, you're watching it.
That's kind of the next one.
Is that exciting?
It gives me chills.
I don't know.
Right.
Say something in the comments.
Pionios.
And we're going to check the comments before we get to Pionios.
Now I just said shout hallelujah, yeah, yeah, and I said Pion and I said Apollo and this
says Pionios is Dionysos, is Dionysus.
Every third year, the Oracle of Apollo becomes the Bacchic Oracle.
They call it third time, third time.
Oh, and what happens?
Purgation baby, oracular purgation.
Do you know what those priestesses do?
Let me just lay it out for you in the actuality so you can feel it.
Those priestesses stop and they join their theosos and they go up into the mountains and they
take with them baskets.
What's in those baskets, Alma?
Let's take a peek.
What's in those baskets?
No, it's women only.
What's in those baskets?
Dildos and snakes.
Dildos and snakes.
And they take those out and they become militaristic crazy.
And if you happen to catch some kid, maybe, I don't know, maybe a pimply face redhead,
teenage kid, you catch him out there in the mountains, you know what that group of women
does to him?
Oh, God.
You want to reset yourself?
You want to reset yourself when you're the Oracle and you're guiding the world?
Because that's what the Oracles do.
People come to them and they say, hey, this guy's a tyrant, what do we do?
And they're like, oh, you got to kill him.
All right.
How do they purge these priestesses?
How do those priestesses purge?
Have you ever chased down a pimply-faced redhead?
Have you ever chased him down?
Have you ever pumped him full of drugs?
Because this is what they're doing.
