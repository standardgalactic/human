And then adding McDonald's in there.
And then Kabul is the opposite.
Kabul is like having a McDonald's dinner
and taking a little bit of a beautiful wine
and adding it to whatever there is going on.
It's not, you know, mix these things.
They don't deserve to be mixed together.
They oppose each other.
They're opposites.
That's how New Ages, I like what you guys are doing.
You're bringing back all these mystery stuff.
But you can't mix these two.
These are opposites.
That's why they call them pagans.
They call them rustics.
Because they're the image of Pan, the rustic god.
It's the image of the devil.
Dionysus is the horned goat.
He has a bunch of sadders around him.
They're Prometheus.
They are demons.
I love that.
I love that.
I love that when you said, what is this guy doing
with all of the saders?
He's in the middle of this thing, what's going on?
Yeah, welcome to the power of the Bacchic Empire.
Welcome, and the origin of that, they called Medea
the origin of that power.
They actually called her the diwanasa.
Imagine during your lifetime being called a divinity.
You have to have done some remarkable stuff
for people to look you in the eyes and to worship you.
That's amazing.
As a life giver, as a soterra, as she brings salvation.
All of those terms, you said all of those terms were Christian.
Exactly.
With plus one more, the gospel.
What is the gospel?
It's a Greek word for the power of the medicine.
It's what the medicine does.
What does the medicine do?
It gives you new life.
By the way, Yvonne Galeon has that Iwa in the beginning.
Iwa, Galeon, good news, whatever you want to call it.
It has Iwa right in the back, right off the bat.
It's got that Bacchic shout.
So you're shouting the salvation.
That's what Iwongaleon means.
Hallelujah.
Allelutzo.
Now listen to what you just did.
Allelutzo, you just did it in its original,
in its original older form, way older, right?
And people say hallelujah and they want hallelujah.
They don't even know where that comes from.
You realize you're shouting a shout to praise Bacchus, right?
You realize you're doing it.
It really tickles the devil to watch,
to watch the followers of Jesus Christ praise Bacchus.
It's hilarious.
Okay, there it is. Allelutzo.
Okay, and look at LXX is on there.
Hallelutzo.
That's another form of it.
General cry, Bacchus, Bacchus.
It's a Bacchic shout.
And look, here's another one.
Allelutzo.
Look how many times it used theocrates.
Homer, Demetrius, Odyssey.
Hey, Sikius.
Oh, it's all over the place.
Yeah.
That word is used all over the ancient world.
So we're not making this up.
We're going to the sources.
This is real stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for coming on tonight.
Tell me just really quick before we go.
I want to know what the next documentary topic is going to be.
Patient drugs.
I'm doing that.
That's the one I want to have.
I have two.
So I'm very ADHD-brained
where I can start working on a project
and then all of a sudden a new idea pops in my brain
and I start working on that one.
I usually have two or three things going on at once.
So I have two projects that are like in the works.
They are going to be done.
I'm not finishing them before I leave.
I'm leaving on the 9th or the 8th, I think.
The night of the 8th.
Be there on the 9th to go to Florida.
Be back in a few days after that.
And then it'll be done probably within that week.
So it'll probably be done mid-May, the first one,
but it's going to be ancient drugs,
ancient medicine stuff.
And then I have another video about
tracking down monism and Pythagorean monism,
how we get Judeo-Christianity from that,
not the other way around.
That'll be another interesting video.
Cool.
Can you do me a favor?
And when you see Danny, tell him I said hello
and tell it to Steve as well.
Steve is Danny's Chewy.
And I just, I miss him.
It was the best day of my life, man.
You're going to have so much.
It's going to be such a great experience for you.
Yeah, please, please give him a nice, firm handshake.
Say, that's for Mom.
And he just wanted me to say, reach out.
Say hello.
That's a good dude right there, Danny.
I like Danny.
Yeah, yeah.
No, totally, totally.
You go, oh God, I envy you for being able to help.
He invites me back.
I'm going to stay for longer if he does.
Yeah.
Anyway, okay.
And the topic was drugs.
So you're going to be pulling in that direction
and getting some more information on that.
And there's a ton of sources that you can get into
for all that kind of stuff.
Fantastic.
And we are pulling back.
Can people see that we're pulling back that film
that kind of blurs you to the reality of the history?
That's coming out and people are becoming interested
in those only because people like Neil are using
those tools, those ancient texts, their weapons,
their weapons for civilization, for civilization.
Is there anything on the feed tonight, Chewy,
that you wanted any comments that you wanted to highlight
just to see?
I don't want to leave the congregation out of it.
And hail knowledge.
Yeah, that's nice.
Put me up a couple, Chewy.
Put me up a couple.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Great work.
Look at this.
Thank you, Neil.
Look, thank you, Neil.
Almond and Chewy.
Can't wait for the classes.
Yes, they're coming.
They're coming and give me another couple.
Hail, Hail, Satan's.
Those are cool.
Kelly.
Yeah.
Reed Galen.
Who put that up?
Oh my God.
Look, the nerd factor here is amazing.
Kelly, Reed Galen and Diascortes.
Look, somebody was like,
Hey, shut up and read Galen.
You know, that is great, bro.
That is great.
And I saw that the low classical series
that they have had a couple more Galens translated
since the last time I saw it.
So I think they got more of the De Mothodo-Medendi,
which is like a nice general work on ancient medicine,
right?
The general practicing.
Yeah.
Love it.
Okay.
And the theories.
Oh, yeah.
It's all sorts of lots of theories.
Looking forward to Almond.
Yes, anybody, Simone, anybody who is interested in AlmondU,
it'll be up and functioning.
I will drop the address for you to go to that.
And if you want to be involved and you want to enlist,
and I just want to repeat,
you can see here what Neil is doing,
and you can see what it takes.
It takes sweat and dedication.
So those of you who want to come to AlmondU,
you've got to have that drive.
You're right.
Everybody can do it.
I can make you do it.
But you've got to have that drive to commit.
You want to get to that place
that the Greek opens up your brain, right?
And you're sitting on your throne and you have that star.
You possess that star.
That's where I want people to be able to get to.
And the Greek will take you there.
People cry.
It's a very, it's amazing to watch what happens
when you give people access.
And suddenly they get something.
It's like a gem.
And they're like, it opens them up.
And the next thing you know,
they're doing something nerdy, artsy.
You know what I mean?
They're doing something that has to do with the muse.
I love it.
Okay.
I'm going to stop.
I'm going to stop.
And I'm going to give you the last word tonight.
Bravo, sir.
And Hail Satan.
Of course, Hail Satan all day long.
You know, bring back the museum.
We need to return to the mystery religions
and bring back the images again,
where all of a sudden images are evil for some reason.
Do not make any graven images of anything.
Why?
Think about why.
Why is that the number one listed in the 10 most serious
commandments out of all the 613 laws there are,
the most serious one is about making images.
Think about that.
Seriously, think about why that is.
Because there's a power in that.
There's a power in the image.
There's a power of the image of hermaphroditus.
That's evil compared in the eyes of the Christians.
That is an abomination.
Get it down.
Take it down.
All this fucking taking down statues
and destroying the temples.
And all of ancient Rome is in ruins now.
And there's churches everywhere.
No, we need to rebuild the museum.
We need to put up those dirty images back up
because they represent something real in nature.
And those are that.
That's just the way this is the reality.
Bring back reality.
That's what I'm saying.
Reason, Gnosis, logos, all that.
So, yeah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah and Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
I'm on the harp in the bongal drums, like the magic gin.
In the morning, I'm on the harp in the bongal drums.
I'm on the harp in the bongal drums, like the magic gin.
In the morning, I'm on the harp in the bongal drums.
I'm on the harp in the bongal drums, like the magic gin.
In the morning, I blaze weed, get behind the mule and push.
Someone's got to grow this sage and frankincense
so they can get high.
Cornucopia from the garden orchard.
Bobo rigatoni sipping wine at the bar collades.
Have a little taste.
High off the contact.
Sounds nice.
The perfume is the intoxication.
