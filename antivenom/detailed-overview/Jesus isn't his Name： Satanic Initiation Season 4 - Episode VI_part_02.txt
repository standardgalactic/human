That's, that's harnessing your environment
You know what I mean?
That's doing your thing
I love it
And what does she do?
Cyprus
Kipraganea
Aphrodite
You know, she takes this bird
And she ties that bird
She ties that bird to that four-cornered hoop
Creates her music
And that hoop is inescapable
Pindar, what?
That hoop is inescapable
Yeah
Yeah
What does she bring?
She brings Manade Ornen
She brings the Minatic Bird
The Minatic Bird
Remember how we looked at Bacchus?
And Bacchus always leads, he always leads to Aphrodite
Here she is
Here she is
And what is Junkz going to do with that song?
What is Junkz going to do with that song?
She's going to draw that erotic power
She's going to draw that erotic power
Yeah
Okay
If you're not comfortable, kiddies, with the witches
I have to say that's too bad
That's too bad because we want the witches here
We want the witches here
Respond, say something in the comments
Please, tell us if you want the witches here or not
But if we've got the witches here, we're going to have to be involved in Aphrodisiacs, are you ready?
If you think I'm kidding, I'm just reading to you from the text
It's not credible trickery here
What does she do? She taught
She first taught men, who did? Aphrodite
She first taught men, what does she teach them? Litas, prayers
And what? Ipaoidas
What is an epode?
That's a magic song
Ipaoidas, I'm sorry for you
And you know what I'm talking about?
Those who haven't come to the orgia
Right?
Every frustrated, unsatisfied evangelical married woman out there
I'm talking to you
Yeah, these are her rights
This is what you have to pay
In order to get your salvation
It's what you have to pay
You have to sacrifice it
You have to sacrifice it
Mary tried to get the antidote to him
She tried to get to the antidote to him
Right? Didn't take it, ended up dead
Right?
There's a reason that this involves sexuality and drugs
People are saying, look, sex and drugs, sex and drugs
What's a sex and drugs?
Sex and drugs is religion
Yeah, I know that sounds funny
But sex and drugs is religion
The operation of the mystery involves sex and drugs
And Jesus getting arrested with a naked boy
Is not unusual
Yeah, let's go back
You don't believe me about the drugs
I know you don't, but here, what does she teach them?
Yeah, she taught them those prayers
And those epodes, those magic songs
Those are songs that when sung can change physics
It's the only way to describe it
Songs that when sung can change physics
Been time and space
It's gorgeous, love it, right?
Drawing down the stars
Did you think they had to have an epode
In order to draw down the stars?
Right? Of course she did
You guys are one step ahead of me anyway
Very intelligent group
Very intelligent
I can tell from your comments
And why, who else did she teach?
She taught the Sophan Ishanidon
Yeah, Ishanides, the son of Isen
Yeah, who is that?
That is Yasun
Yasun
Yeah, yeah
Give me the yonks
Pull out the yonks before we get the drugs
Pull out the yonks
Yeah, look at this people
This is gorgeous
Here's your Reineck, right?
Here's your Reineck
Look at number two
Metaphor, spell or charm
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
But look at what it says at the end of that one
Passionate yearning
What does number three say?
Oh here, we get to make fun of people who study
Aramaic and biblical studies
For a minute, this is fantastic
I love this, where'd you come from?
I told you to stay in your cage
Metaphor, spell, charm
Passionate yearning for
Oh yes, hitaron
Agathon hitaron, you want those good hitaron
Those good companions
Those women can teach you
Surprised?
Yes, they weren't
Yeah, they weren't
Fantastic
Oh, I love this
Did you notice that that's the thing
Between the pagans and the Christians
And the Orthodox Jews
And the Muslims like Artalaban
