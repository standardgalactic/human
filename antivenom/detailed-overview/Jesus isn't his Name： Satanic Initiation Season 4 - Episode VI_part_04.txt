You know, will come back
With an enlightenment
And eyes open
Eyes open
Yeah
And then your democracy
Alright
So now's the question
Will you honor
Decay justice?
Let's go back to the text
We're going to beat up some Aramaic scholars, weren't we?
Yeah, they don't have Jack, right?
Everybody out next person
Says the word Aramaic to me
It's just north of
It's just north of a fart
Of Josephus through an angels rectum
It's just north of that
Yeah
So, yeah, there's nothing
Man, they're administrative stuff
Inscriptions
Of a single letter
It's awful. Don't tell me
That has anything to do with it
It doesn't
It's fantastic. Where is Moses' potion?
We're going to take it. Hang on
Put that down
Put that down for a minute
Okay, now we're going to
Go real quick
We're going to jump Bronze Age
And we're going to go to where
Moses is sitting at the bush
Moses is sitting there at the bush
What are you doing, Moses?
He is
Looking at a bush that doesn't burn
It's on fire
But it doesn't burn
It's on fire. This burning bush
But it doesn't burn
Yeah, what is this thing?
What does our oldest text
Say it is?
The text, the Septuagint
Which is the native original
The Septuagint
Is not a translation
The Septuagint says
It is the Kasia
Yeah
And what does the Kasia do?
Get this
Ladies, I love this
Remember, this is Moses
The guy who's holding up the serpent
Right
All that setting up tents
Where you can get the
Oracular word of God
Through your priests
Yeah, got the burnt altars going
That guy
Right
What is he doing
In front of this bush
What does it have to do with the serpents
And all that kind of stuff
Well, if you just look
Where the classicist Harvard
Never look
You might find in these
Sources like
Diascorides
The name Moses
Directly attached with the medicinal use
Of the bush
That burns but is not consumed
Now you know
Look, I just stormed into your temple
And took your junk
I just stormed into your temple
And I took your junk
You know who I'm talking to
Yeah, what does Jehovah
Have to do with it
Cool to you all, right
That thing's made up
From later
This name is Joshua
Wait, what?
I thought you said it was
Joshua
Joshua
No, it's not
It's Jesus
Yeah
This is a perfectly good Greek word
That predates
Any sort
Of Hebrew that you have
By 600 years at very least
If not longer
As soon as you guys in linear A
Get your act together
Figure it out
Okay
We'll have more data then
You know, that laundry list
It's not laundry list, bro
There's a lot there
Show us the drug, Zaman
What is he gonna do this for?
What is Jason gonna do this?
On Aphrodite's direction
What is he gonna do?
He's gonna
Make the mind
Of her mad
Burning
He's gonna make her mind burn
At the edge
Of the whip
Whose whip is it?
Desire
Desire
Petho
