Do you really need the sacks in your religion?
Yeah, you do
The mystery doesn't work
Here we go
Aphrodite is there
Forming the drugs
Adding them to the oil
Drugs that are
Antitoma
Antitoma
It's one of the earliest
Words
For antidote
I've got several words
For antidotes and drugs
Antitoma
It's the anti-cutting
Or it's the cutting
That's in the opposite direction
Isn't that nice?
Now this happens to be
Hesechius

What are you doing here?
You kind of smell a little bit
But all those hours
Sitting right in your lexica
You got all sweaty britches
Sweaty

Meant to balance
Meant to balance
The pain or the suffering
Isn't that nice?

What is she doing?
She's preparing her drugs
She's making the antidote
It's something that's going to work
Against his pain
Okay
He's going to be coming up
Against fire
So something
To repel that fire
And she gave it to him
For what?
For his
Christing
For his
Christing
This is not anointing
For his Christing
You can rub oil
For anybody that you want
But that is not Christing
When you get Christed
You get stung
You get stung into the madness
Why does she have to do that?
Because she's using it on the medwa
To get her to help
The iasan
