No problem with that
But
What we're interested in looking at is
Where did you guys get all this stuff
Where is this mystery operation
Coming from
River Fossus
For those of you who knows
The Edim reference
That is the place, the paradise
Where the
Where she who shouts
Bacchus, that's where she is
Right?
Was our serpent
Didn't belong to them
Appropriation is appropriation
But
Goes back deep
All the way through the Pulaskians
We love it
That epode
And
Thanks to the Palm Pharmacon
What is that?
That's the highest, that's the highest
Linguistically the highest level
That we have recorded
For the witch who knows the drugs
That's your
Fatima case
Or your Fatima case
And you have
You have your
Polypharmacon
The state of
Knowing many drugs
Which is a step above that
Regular witch, you better watch out for her
She's doing stuff like castrating people
And
You know
For what lack of a better word
Experimentation
A lot of psychedelic stuff
We don't have her anymore, right?
We don't have that Polypharmacon anymore
We don't have, but there's one step above that
And that's the
Palm Pharmacon
That's that root pan
That's everything
She is the
Witch
That is the witchiest
Yeah, because that word for witch
Doesn't come from that terrible Anglo-Saxon
Whatever that is
Sounds like the guy had a
Stroke or something, right?
Um, no, it's the
Fatima root
The root, it's the drugs
It's the drugs
Fantastic
And here's the skill in all charms
Notice that the only reference we're going to have
Is to Medea, right?
And despite this
Despite the fact that she had
The
Reputation of being the most advanced
In ancient drug use
And ritual
And despite this
She
Still
Shined as a genius
Right? Even though
Even though we see it in a context
That's very foreign to us
You can feel the radiation
From Medea's
Discoveries is what I'm trying to say
This woman
Was a genius
Hands down
And incredibly skilled
This is Lady Babylon
Right? This is Lady Babylon
Which she was the queen of
Right?
And the founder of the Medes
And all you purses
All you people call yourselves Persians
Right? It was a royal line
That came through Caucus on the Black Sea
You realize that, right?
Right?
So, yeah
Get your bearings there, Magi
Get them in. Where was that word
That meant Chaldean? Remember one of our
Words was with the Chaldeans, right?
We can't lose track of these people
These are all nations
And tongues
Right? Assembled together
So that the abomination
Of the Animosis
Can be seen in the temple
Again, right?
Good. Love it
And
I think we will
I've got just a couple of words for you
Let me just pull out a couple of words
Where are some of the words too that I didn't get to
We were at Yonks
Yeah, here's your Pirates
You want your
Your true pirate
Right?
You want your true pirate? Look at the very last thing
That it says here at the bottom
Leisteis
It's a later word
When you say Jesus wasn't a pirate
You weren't thinking
Oh, this is a later word
