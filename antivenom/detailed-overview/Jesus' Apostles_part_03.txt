To be involved
Yeah, another young person
To be involved
And what happened to Judas
In all of this?
Well there are two accounts
Here's part of the mystery
Are you ready?
I'm prepping you
We're going into this crime scene
And I want you to figure out
What happened
Okay, in this one verse
That's all
We're just looking at one verse
I want you to figure out
What actually happened
We have two accounts
One in Matthew
And one in the Acts of the Apostles
The first one in Matthew
Is totally different
It's totally different
From the other one
And the other one
The one in Acts
You will never see this thing
Depicted in art anywhere
As a matter of fact, Chewie
Is reaching into that quantum singularity
And pulling out the very first images
The very first images
Of what is actually going on
In this verse
Go ahead and throw that verse up there
Let's throw it up there
Boom
Here it is
Acts 118
What did Judas do?
He bought a piece of land
Isn't that nice?
He's an entrepreneur
He bought himself a piece of land
From what?
From the wage of his injustice
Right?
For turning in Jesus
He got that
Now we're going to get a phrase
That our whole goal here tonight
Is to try to translate
What happened?
What happened to Judas?
And he mentioned
Sai Gymnastics
And he invented
The rose of the flower
Alright?
Now I know
You're running to the end there
And you saw the rose of the flower
And you said
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
This is associated
with the boys
and theocratists
This is why
They chase boys
They talk about it
These are the goodies
The goodies the boys give
of, how do you think we tell all of this
Herospecy, all of this reading of the signs,
we do it from this power. Now
what does the English, and everybody asks this question, they've been
asking us, no it's not embryo, it's an exaggeration, people ask me this
question, why you, why are you giving us the
reality, and why haven't people before you
right, why haven't they come up and done it, and my
answer is because of the weakness of classical philology,
that classical philologists haven't been studying medical or scientific documents
for ages, and all they needed to do was look into the
pharmaceutical side, and they didn't, and I did
and I'm happy to have done that, and I'm bringing that to you.
Now what is, look at these translations of this verse, before I
translate it for you, which we're going to do,
I want you to see what the English is, are you ready, get your fantasy
caps on, with the payment he received for his wickedness,
Judas bought a field, there he fell
headlong, his body burst open, and all his
intestines spilled out, wait a minute,
what, first of all
is that Greek, does not say anything about falling,
there is no falling there, yeah, it doesn't,
I'm going to show you, it doesn't say, what do you mean his,
he burst open, he burst open, does anybody
know about this, right, this is what you call
immediate tummy explosion,
yeah, it happens all the time, if you're reading
the inerrant word of God, and you come across
this translation, please, please explain to me
what this means, Judas bought a field with the money he
received for his treachery, falling headfirst
there, his body split open, spilling out
his intestines, wait a minute, now this man acquired a field, yeah, yeah, yeah,
and falling headlong, he burst open, there's going to be a lot of falling headlong,
I don't know why translations, different translations are so similar,
it's because Christian translators are weak
because they don't read anything, but they're
garbage, and by garbage, everybody's got
garbage, right, everybody's got it, they're not
reading anybody else's, how are you going to strengthen
your understanding of the language, if all you read is the newspaper
from 1980, seriously,
what are you going to do, oh my god,
give me the King James, let's see what the King James does, now this man purchased the field
with the reward of iniquity, that sounds more ominous,
and falling headlong, he burst the sander in the midst
he
burst his belly in his midsection, he burst that open
right, okay,
okay, now how are we going to figure out what is actually going
on, right, are you ready, I'm going to reveal it for all the
