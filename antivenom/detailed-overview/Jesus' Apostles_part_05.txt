disservice, Miss Typebox, you do them a great disservice
and they're watching you, they're watching
you, fantastic, let's go to the next one
right, let's go to the next one, that was not very
scary, look let's get down to here, do this one real quick, do this one
look people, what bug are we talking about, we're talking about Spanish fly
right, the term Spanish fly, thank you Alan
the term Spanish fly is referred to various aphrodisiacs
oh I forgot to tell you, this is their big aphrodisiac
like the cantharides, the blister beetle
right, they produce that chemical, what does it do
let's see, however the real Spanish fly contains a hazardous substance
that can blister your skin right and can kill you too
are you ready, give me the next one, watch what happens, remember by the way
by the way Pliny was talking about how specific
the amounts are that they're working with right, because they know
why do they have to be that specific, because they know if they give too much
they'll kill you, watch what happens, where does it come from, true Spanish
fly is made from blister beetles, specifically the substance produced
by the beetles is called cantharidin, John Scarborough
wrote about cantharidin and what it does and how it interacts
with the prostate, the insects name is not for nothing
contact with cantharidin, blisters the skin
now you know why, they call
it the burning purple, guess what this drug
is one of the ones they use for cancer treatment, external cancer treatment
okay
contact with cantharidin, blisters skin, its use dates
way back and some of its many infamous fans include
a Roman Empress who used cantharidin to encourage sexual behavior
worthy of blackmailing her family, that's nice, Roman Gladiator
is using it for orgies, wasn't just Gladiators, Queens
who used it on their kings and those kings on their mistresses
now he says to spice things up
but watch what's happening, this is not intentional
dried beetles would be crushed and mixed with drinks or sweets
not always to the receiver's knowledge, what do you think
Cersei was putting on those pigs food
putting the blister beetle, you know you can kill someone
like that, right, yeah and every once in a while they do
they do, when Medea went to the temple of Hera
to dedicate her children, couple of them didn't make it through
the process, those children were dedicated to Hera
okay, they're working with very dangerous
chemicals, very dangerous, none of that he talks about
fumigating this one, I don't know how that would change it, I don't know what that would
do, but it gets crazy, okay give me the next one after that one, yeah
along with long lasting erections, Spanish fly was found
to cause a number for serious side effects, including
death, so if we had a commercial for Spanish fly
today we would have to have somebody read, you know this includes serious side effects
including death, right, even death as the
Marquis de Sade tragically discovered in 1772
after giving sweet and a seed balls laced with Spanish fly
to prostitutes,
why would he be giving Spanish fly to the prostitutes
because as anyone knew in antiquity
especially the women who were involved
with the midwifery, there's a way to make
a woman's body heated, there's
a way to fill your heated center
and to cause you to burst into flames
yes, I saw this done once in an interview
I saw it done once in an interview, the photographer was surprised, spontaneous
combustion, right on the spot, right on the spot
it was fantastic, love it
this is the power of the drug
this is the power of the drug that they're talking about
a power to force you
to be brought to a place of
climactic perfection
and it all starts they say with your
heat, right, it all starts with your heat
and how that heat can be focused and where it can be focused
and the drug does just that
it takes it to the part of your body
now what does it do in men, it just happens to have, now this drug
is first for a woman, it's not a man's drug
but when you give it to men, you get saders
you get saders, give me the next
look at what are the symptoms that we get here
people, urination, pain for urination
when you're in a psychotic fit, that's no fun, blood in your urine
vomiting blood, you're going to get the clue here, there's a lot of blood
coming out of different places, difficulty swallowing, seriously
difficulty, are you kidding, I've got blood coming out of places
I don't care how hard it is, priapism, fancy talk
this author said, persistent pain for erections
they also call it satiriasis, they have numerous words
for it because it's a common drug activity
you can cause this person to have a painful
unremitting erection, causes abdominal pain
eventually kidney failure, some gastrointestinal bleeding
you get a lot of bleeding out the anus with it
a lot of bleeding out the anus and then some
neurological, as you shoot down
as you shoot down the slide of death
go ahead and put some of our pictures up there, as you shoot down the slide of death
eventually it takes your nervous
tissue and turns it into not good
it kills you, and how does it kill you
causes you to shed
that essential life that flows
from that
body under the influence of the drug
it pushes you to a place of climax
you say, every place of climax that you want to go, you want to go there yourself
this is an invasive
proposition that we've got going
we're in antiquity and we're going through these rites, I'm going to drug you
I've read many many examples of people
praise this as drugging people
so I'm going to drug you and I'm going to
forcefully, I'm going to forcefully
climax you, you're not going to want it
you're going to be in a psychotic state and I'm going to cause you to come to that place
of complete and total
sexual union with cosmos
you're going to see how everything works when we take you there, you're going to understand the machinery
you're going to understand your hard drive, you're going to understand what's happening
that is what they're performing
now what are they doing that with, one of the components are these
blister beetles, give me the next one
go back to that plenty one
I wanted you to see here
