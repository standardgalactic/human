minagogue and diuretic, for which lastries and hypocrites used to prescribe
them for dropsy, that's swelling, inflammation, extra swelling
Cato was reproached, now listen to this, everybody loves Cato
because he's totally conservative, totally conservative
this guy's a farmer and he thinks that the land has taught him
everything and he's just come out of the ground
and what happens, watch what happens, Cato of Utica
was reproached, was selling poison because when disposing
of a royal property by auction, he sold a quantity of
cantharides at the price of 60,000
cisterces, dude
if they came to your state
and found 60,000 cisterces worth of drugs
what do you think is gonna, now an antiquity
right, it's only looked down upon because that stuff is so toxic
but he's got a whole bunch of sex drug in this house
a lot of sex drug, hopefully he's got a lifetime supply of sex drug
he's not, it's so much that he can't use all of them
self, that's for, you know, that's for other people
you mean these Romans, these famous Romans or drug dealers
yes, they are because there's no laws against it
and if you are free
you can take cantharides, you can
yeah, they don't want that stuff to be regulated, that's your health
that's your health, that's between you and your physician
wait a minute, they said that in antiquity, yes
yes, tyranny always takes that away
it always takes away your choice, doesn't matter
if it's your vote
yeah, give me the next one
give me the next one, I hate it Martha when he talks about it, come here Fred
you midwestern, god, he needs it so bad
take Martha home Fred, aphrodisiacs, let's see
in its natural form, cantharadon is secreted by the male blister beetle and given to the female
as a compulsory gift during mating, afterwards the female
beetle covers her eggs with it, defense against predators, fantastic
right, look at it, nature is gorgeous man, if you can't watch this and say
holy mackerel, nature is gorgeous, give it to me
the French surgeon
Ambrose Pell, described a case in 1572
of a man suffering from the most
satirized, why is it frightful satirized?
do you want to be the
one guy with frightful satirizes?
first of all
satirizes is priapism, it's a painful
unremitting erection
why are there
degrees of it, and why do you not want to be
or want to be that person with it, the most
frightful satirizes, after taking a potion composed of
nettles, yeah, and a
cantharad extract, so he's taking the blister beetle plus the
nettles, which I know they used to nettle in their sex rites
so it's doing something right, this dude is on to his, the surgeon is on to
his stuff, this is perhaps the same man of whom
Parr relates that a courtesan
sprinkled a cantharad powder on food she served to him
after which the man experienced, get ready for this
violent priapism and anal bleeding
of which he later died
of which he later died
of which he later also cites the case of a priest who died
after swallowing a dose of cantharadis
which he intended to fortify his sex drive
wait, what, was that, wait, was that a catholic priest
a catholic priest fortifying his sex drive
too much, too much
it's just too much, do you see how the devil
works, it's overwhelming, you mean you can be given a frightful
priapism, you can be given a torturous priapism
and then be forced to burst
yes you can, yes you can
and it's part of the mystery
cantharadis is being used, blister beetle is being used
and there are descriptions of it both in Latin and Greek
what it is doing exactly
what it is doing with Judas
let's see the next one, okay, bring it, we gotta bring it
I'll tie it back together carefully
I just want to see this one, look, they're using some remedies that you wouldn't necessarily
consider remedies like rams flesh, right, broth
rams flesh, broth, right, okay, so in other words
crazy aroused inducer, what does it do with women
it just causes you to burst, to get really hot and burst
what you know has its
advantages
right, but look what you can do
you kind of have some rams flesh, some sheeps milk
very useful in cases where persons of drunken infusion of aconite
oh my god, aconite
that's wolf's pain, that stuff will kill you dead
we've been looking at aconite, it's one of those poisons that they use
specifically, that thing will knock you the hell out
that's it, you're gone, aconite, look they're drinking it, so wait a minute
now what I gotta do, I gotta get my blister beetle and I gotta get some
some of this, I gotta mix it all together apparently and some of the sheeps milk
right, or look, you know people who've got the
buprestis in there already, what would you be drinking at
aconite and buprestis for, Nero knew
why do you think he wanted the formula so bad
give me the next one, this is a mystery term by Heracles, I'm gonna do
this for the first time tonight, I know I said short story and it's getting long
and I wanna bring you, I wanna bring you to the climax
but I wanna give you a mystery term, are you ready people
this is a line by Heracles
and what does he say
that is a mystery
statement, if you can understand that
you will understand what the initiate must undergo
give me the next one, sometimes we leave it with mystery
people what happened, now take us back
wait should we take us back to the very first verse that we had
that's our quote for the evening, not that one, that one, give me that one
no not that one either, this one, there we go
this is our ax 118 and finally we're gonna find out what happened to
Judas, what happened to Judas, he bought this
plot of land, he's gonna settle down, he's got some money
he bought this plot of land from his, that he got from his
turning in Jesus, and what happened
Prenes genominos, Prenes genominos, he became
what, he became Prenes, now hit me with the definition
good, what did he become, which is actually
this is from Prenes, but that's just the length of the vowels, look the
Ionian lengthens it, alright, the Ionian lengthens
