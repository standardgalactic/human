it, okay good, that's what it says, with the face
downwards, lying on the front, falling forwards, head long
down, oh my god, look at the bottom, look at the bottom
the very bottom line
Fortase, what is that, that fort, it's Fortase
it's Latin for perhaps, they're trying to explain
these are Victorian scholars trying to explain
how this word is being used
in the Acts of the Apostles, and they have to put in parentheses
Fortase, perhaps, this is from
preces, becoming
distended, distended, hit me with the next one
distended, watch this people, this word
equals pretho to blow up or distend, and what
kind of authors are using it to mean to blow up or distend
look at the end of the first line, the Acts of the Apostles
this is a different passage, 286, you know what that means, it means
this one author is using this term
this way consistently
and who else is using it, Hippocratic Nature of Women
Hippocratic Nature of Women
is the author of Acts using a medical
term, Yep, and that author is using it repeatedly
the same way, okay, give me the next one
now, here is the verb from which it comes
right, pimpremi
and notice that it can mean to burn with fever
can mean to burn, the whole idea of
burning and the swelling are combined, they talk about
love burns me, I can feel the love in
my loins, right, when they say can you feel the love
tonight, they were talking about a burning sensation in your genitalia
can you feel the love tonight
it's the burning in classical antiquity
it's the burning, can you feel the burning, you know what that burning attracts
moisture, it attracts moisture
what are we doing with the
confidus, what are we doing with the confidus, that beetle
that causes us to be able to come to a forced
climax while our anus
bleeds
watch this, give me the next one, give me the next one
where we were, buprestis animal
look what he says, this is plenty, buprestis is a
you know, it's kind of rare in Italy, right, and it's very similar to the scarab
and it really escapes the cow's notice
right, it falls in among the herbs and the cows eat it
and what happens when the cows eat it, they become inflamed
they become surging
and they rupt, they burst
they burst from that inner surge, why?
it's in the chemicals, it's in the chemicals, it's all that
interaction, right, and again, I worked down a dairy
I'll tell you for a fact, I've never seen a cow explode, and I've seen many
not many, but a handful die of bloat
where they literally cannot give off any more gas
they actually just choke themselves, right, they just suffocate themselves
there's no explosion
we're talking about bringing the person to the place where they can spill
their goodies, are you ready, give me the next one
are you ready, oh god, you mean Judas, remember when Judas got
angry, oh we're gonna see that in a minute, okay look, from the
viper they make a pastel, right, which they call a theriac
right, and the Greeks say that these things are
poisons, right, I just want you to see, the Romans are well aware
of the capacity the Greeks have for using the theriacs
when the woman is seated on the beast, that beast is that
theriac, give me the next one
it's gorgeous, I love it, okay, I know people it's getting, I thought it would go
slower, this is what you're doing, you're becoming
preines, you're becoming
distended, you mean Judas
didn't just follow, look, he was at the sale, right Chewie
he was at the sale of the property and the
realtor there was like congratulations, you just bought your first
town and he was like, ah, and his guts exploded and
just spilled out in front of him, like an exorcist or something
right, concomitantly with Jesus on the cross, now
the author of Matthew knew, right, that he had to have
a death scene, this scene in Acts doesn't talk about
doesn't say explicitly Judas died
it doesn't, strangely enough
strangely enough, the Matthew scene does and in Matthew
he just, he feels bad, but he's like, oh, he doesn't buy a
lot of land so he can party, right, he does what
he hangs himself, right, because he feels bad
he feels bad, this is not the death scene
there's no death here, so what's happening
he's swelling, he's swelling and what happens after that
he bursts in the mids, he burst
in the mids, have you ever bursted in your mids, I'm gonna burst
in, I'm gonna fall over the place, you know what I mean
that's how we all get here, right
that's how we all get here, give me the next one
and what happens, he pours out, what is flowing out
what is flowing out of this guy, what is he
give it to me, cheer me to the next one, what is flowing out of this guy
was pouring out of him, all of that
goody, good, good stuff coming from the
oracular, yummies
oh, remember last week with Theocris, a couple
episodes ago, we talked about, we tracked it down, we talked about Paul and his
thorn and the flesh and everything that he's doing with the boy, goody goods
you didn't think we'd get away from him, did you
you didn't think we'd get away from him, and people say
how can you take, how can you read that, listen to these
brainiacs, how can you read that definition and take something from
a part of it, right, Dan, Dan who is
how can you take
something from the back side of the definition, look at this all the way to the bottom, oh well let's just cut
that part out like that, right, it's one word we're talking about and that word
has a history, and if you don't understand how that word is used through history
you don't read Greek, I'm sorry, I'm sorry you don't
right, for everybody, for everybody who wants
that accent to be something that I said it wasn't, good luck
good luck, 35 years, right
this is where I can help you get, give it to me, I'm giving
them all the stuff, I don't care, I'm not gonna sell anything
give me that, watch this people, this is a, look this is me
and I told you this before, I told you this before
when we talk about the seed of those feelings, those splachna
do you know what's coming out, give me the next one, do you know what's coming out
