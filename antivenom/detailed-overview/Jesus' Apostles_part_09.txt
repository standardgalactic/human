those, those passions
those are those passions, do you see what you can do with that
pice, you can cause those passions
to come to fruition, you realize
take it down for a second, you realize the Olympic games
the Olympic games were there
in the presence of the games of Hera
the games of Hera, and what were those games, those were
education games, those were coming of age games
for girls, yeah
the schools that started on lesbos
for girls, those are the earliest forms of education
your society
your western society is built upon a library
that was brought to you by women
honest man religions could tear down and burn
give me one, we're gonna have two more
two more then we'll call it cause people are tired, I know that
what did I, what is that, that sounds dirty, remember those people
I wanted you to think of the perineum, what is the perineum
that's that place, remember we talked about this, that's the place between
your anus and your genitalia
it's that flat land, it's that flat land, okay
give me the next one, your glutes, right, under your glutes
what are those centaurs, they're lace-dye
they're pedarasts, Jesus Christ
I said this a long time ago
you were with me, you've been with me the whole way
and I said to you, you trusted me, I told you
the centaurs, those are those traffickers, they are the
pedarasts, when you say lace-dace
you are saying pedarast
you are saying somebody who abuses and
traffics children, who abuses them sexually
using drugs just like the one
that we just looked at, just like the one we just looked at
do you know what he was doing
give me that last one, do you know what he was doing
he was
in that field blown up with the
buprestis bursting and
spilling out a seed while our Lord Jesus Christ
was dying, and Peter is the one who relates
this tale, why?
because we all know he's dead, what happened Peter, were you a witness
to it, no, all we
know is that he spilled everything
that blood came out and that's all there was, he was OD
you mean Judas Iscariot and Jesus Christ
were both under the influence of drugs
when they died
supposedly, yes
yes, this is how the language
works, this is how you
express that performance of the mystery
and you don't see it because there is a
gulf between us and them and the only bridge
between that gulf is that thing that you and I have in common
blah blah blah
the only way we get there is through the language
when I tell people Jesus is saying I'm not a
pedarast, I'm not a child
I'm not a child trafficker
I can pull up a text for you and I can show you the text
and you can, you know, be convinced or not
but the fact is you are the people
who want to take that trip, you're the people
who want to look into that reality, not the ones who want to say
his kitchen, look at his kitchen, what
a bunch of impoverishment, I'm going to save that for next time, I want to end with a quote
I asked Dr. Carl Brock
I asked him, give me a quote, I've got a bunch of
Greek students now and I want to encourage them
tell me as a classicist, tell me something, he said
I consider ancient Greek the prototypical humanity
he just sent me this in his email, I'm putting it up there
like it's a quote, but he just emailed me this, the language
and the cultural fantasies encoded in its mythological traditions
have provided the nomenclature for many of the well-known
psychological paradigms, for example the edema
complex, but the art in literature
this is the part I like, unlike the tormenting delusions
of psychosis or the products not
of a diseased mind, but the highest aspirations
of our creative spirit or soul, thank you
the highest aspirations of our creative spirit
or soul, thank you, this is from a man
that was from a man who has spent
many many years studying
reading Greek, he has a taste for it and a flavor
he has an understanding of it that you cannot
parallel, we should consider him
a modern
savior, it's his knowledge, it's that
knowledge, it's that ability to work with that Greek
that brings us to that savior
definitely, love it and you can have that too
keep working on the Greek, keep working, I know
I've got classes coming up and I know I'm still
planting the Aussie class and I love it, thank you very much
and I still got some adding to the European class, people are working hard
people are working hard and I appreciate it and we're going to go full
steam ahead and when someone like Peterson has the guts
to come out
and to discuss what those texts say
we'll be there, keep telling everybody that you run into
keep telling them, if they say talk about Jesus
you talk about Jesus too, take back the Bible people
this is our chance to take back the Bible, I thank you very
much for coming tonight and I hope
that you can see the reality that is
in those texts because it's always so much better
unfortunately not for the monists because that's where all of the evidence
against them is, thank you for coming
tonight, Hail Satan
