but it took him a while to get here.
He's lazy.
Eusebius is the laziest.
For having written as much as he did,
it's one of the laziest people on the planet.
He steals stuff too.
Credit, dudes.
Go ahead.
Yep, yeah, so anyway, Zoe and Aguero.
What we have people, you can take that.
What I just wanted to point out is that we have the life
that is rising from a state of death.
What do you do when you agate or someone?
When Jesus walks up,
how does he bring those dead boys back to life?
He awakens them.
He awakens them.
Let's see it.
You wanna see where he's getting with the boys?
Here it is.
Here it is, people.
Are you ready?
So I'm gonna start just the time.
I'm just gonna translate it quickly
because I want you to hear the flow of the story.
Yeah, blow it up for me, Chewie.
Are you ready?
So Jesus got pissed off
and he went out with her to the garden
where the memorial was
and immediately he heard from the tomb a great voice.
And Jesus, you know, coming up,
he rolled off the stone from the front of the thing
and went inside and right away,
there was this little kid.
There was this little kid.
Jesus stretched out his hand and he agated him.
Take it down for a second, Chewie.
He awakened him.
He brought him from a place of unconscious reality
to a place of conscious reality.
That is the Greek.
Now, the only reason I know this is from Greek sources.
When you expose yourself over and over and over again
to this language,
you develop a flavor for the vocabulary
and it's very easy to see.
My friends who claim you shouldn't do that.
Classical philologists get to where they are
with sweat and blood.
You should give credit
and you shouldn't be dressing up like a police officer
and pulling people over if you're not a police officer.
Yes, fantastic.
Let's do this then.
Okay, keep looking.
I want everybody to focus on the shenanigans.
Yeah, what's going on in line 57?
There was this little kid
and Jesus stresses out his hand.
He raises him from that unconscious state.
Now, remember the kid's unconscious
but Jesus is hearing voices from the grave.
He's hearing voices from the grave.
Do you know this little kid is not the only one in here?
Did you ever notice that?
These guys are crowding around these tombs,
getting on those torches with the fumigations,
getting wild.
No, no, no, go ahead, blow it up to me.
Let's keep translating.
Isn't it lovely?
So there's this little kid there.
Now watch this, watch this.
Oh, God.
Says with his hand, right?
With his hand that has that power.
That's how he raises him.
That's a magic expression, people.
Jesus is doing magic.
The guy who translated this,
who found this manuscript,
said, Jesus is a magician.
And here he is, sorcerer Jesus.
Are you ready?
And the young boy looked down at him
and fell in love.
And he began to beg him.
He began to beg Jesus.
Then he might be with him.
Okay.
Yeah, wait.
Is this a text, an ancient text?
We're gonna categorize it.
