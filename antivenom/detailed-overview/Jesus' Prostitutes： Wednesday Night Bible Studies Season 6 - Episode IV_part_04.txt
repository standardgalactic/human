Pseudo, pseudo something.
I don't care, it's a text.
And the vocabulary happens to fit very well,
very well.
If this thing has any doubt or question about it,
as a classical philologist, it is exquisite.
It is exquisite.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Interesting style.
Love it.
Let's go back to it and see that text again.
I'll keep translating.
Okay, hold on, people.
The kid falls in love with him.
He says, let me be with you, right?
And so they left.
They get up and they left the tomb
and they came to the house of this kid.
And this is a little bit distressing.
Yeah, I've hanged out with Lucius.
What is the, because he was rich?
Yeah, yeah, he was a rich kid.
Okay, whatever.
I don't know what's going on, but this is a party
and it's in a nice place and Jesus is there.
And what happens?
And after six days, Jesus gives this kid
specific instruction.
So Jesus is staying on the compound, right?
With this kid that has been begging him to be with them.
And what happens when evening comes
after Jesus gave him these instructions?
The little kid comes to him and he is,
look, it's line 62.
He is covering his Gumnos.
He's covering his, you remember those secret parts
of the woman?
Yes, you have the same things in the boy.
You have the secret parts.
Yeah, and he's got a bandage.
He's got a bandage on his secret parts.
Yeah, oh my goodness.
Wait, and he was in the tomb?
Okay, you've seen it, but now, right?
We've been here before.
This is just memory for us.
What I want you to focus on is the prostitution
behind it, the bigger picture.
That's what I want you to focus on.
With these associates of Jesus,
together in an enterprise, working together.
You wondered why it was that John lives
until like 90 something, right?
You're like, why is he so old?
It's because when he was with Jesus,
he was a child.
He was a child prostitute.
The apostles of Jesus Christ
are child prostitutes working for a trafficker
who is using a mystic drug.
Fantastic, fantastic, good job, Jesus.
Right, now you know why he got indicted.
Let's go back up.
People will find out, right?
You don't have to wait until the end.
Let's go back to that same source.
And I just want you guys to see what happens.
They go to the house after six days.
He gives them these instructions.
He comes in, he's got that thing wrapped around his hoo-ha.
And what does he do?
He stays with Jesus.
Everybody on my Greek class on 63, line 63.
Look at that nice accusative duration of time, right?
Extent of time, love this.
He stayed there with him the whole night long.
And what happened with Jesus?
Jesus taught him, Jesus taught him.
Look at the bottom line, the mystery of the kingdom of God.
Take it down, yeah.
Okay, all right.
Within the context of the child sex slave trade, right?
All of these apostles of Jesus have left
their homes or neighborhoods
or wherever they were associated with.
Join themself to Jesus, yeah, okay.
Okay, let's go to the next text.
I want us to see.
Everybody, this is another word
that I just want to introduce you to.
This is gorgeous.
Look at this orgia, right?
