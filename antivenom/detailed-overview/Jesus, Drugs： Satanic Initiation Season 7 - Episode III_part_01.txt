I'm going to give you what I just read you.
I'm going to give it to you now in his words from antiquity, from antiquity.
All this stuff that I've been talking about with the drugs, you know, you're sitting there thinking,
I am not going to find drugs with Jesus while he's getting excruciatingly crucified.
Yeah. Yeah, you are.
And it's not going to be from my lips.
It's going to be from a guy who wrote in the language and had a very good understanding of the cult.
Very good.
Okay, let's go to the next source.
Go. Boom.
Okay, here we are, people.
This is a secret text.
I want to show you this secret text.
Are you ready for this?
This is from the very same passage.
It's just not as his translation.
So I'm just going to start up at the top in line 28.
He said to the people, I'm thirsty.
I'm thirsty.
Yeah.
And next to him where he was in a spot next to him was this container full of the oxos and some dude.
Here it says a dude.
Some dude thought he heard oxos, so he dipped a sponge.
He dipped a sponge.
Where did he dip the sponge?
First of all, what is a sponge?
He says in line 31, he says, you know what the sponge is?
The sponge is the offspring of the sea.
It comes from that underwater temple.
That holiest of holies.
He says as the aduton.
It comes from that inner chamber.
That's where the sponge is.
And what is this?
What else is it?
He, he, he soaks it.
He does what?
He soaks it in the, what does he fill it with?
He fills it with the trimutatoiopoto, the potion that is the most acrid.
It's the most biting.
What do they call it?
Dipsados, halmes.
They call this one.
Get ready for this.
Are you ready for a drug name, people?
Are you ready for this?
They call this the brine of the viper.
They call it the brine of the viper.
Brine of the viper.
Oh, are you kidding?
This has got to be good stuff.
It's wonderful.
Potio.
Right?
Romans are looking at each other.
Put the potio together and just give it to the guy.
Right?
We don't care.
They're standing there.
The women are standing there.
Everybody's distracted.
What do they do?
They offer him this stuff.
Bring us back to notice.
Bring us back to notice.
This is a lovely picture.
Look how grim and dark it is.
Because remember, there's an eclipse.
Right?
And he gets it.
At the end of the eclipse, boom.
He's dead after he drinks it.
Druggy.
Bring us back to text.
Look what he's got here.
Right?
It's the dipsados.
It's specifically that viper that causes you to thirst.
I want you to just keep that in mind.
I'm going to keep translating for you.
So this dude holds it up way up high on this pole.
This read.
Right?
And he gives it right to him.
And look at 155, the first word.
Antidoton.
It's a smudge underneath it.
It's antidoton.
What is the thing that is given to Jesus from the dude below him?
From the dude below him.
This guy from antiquity says it's an antidote.
It's an antidote.
What is it an antidote to?
Well, first of all, it's for the king.
It's for the Bosileus, baby.
We're going to the kingdom.
You want to go to the kingdom?
I'll show you a king.
I'll take you right there right now.
We'll go.
Do you want some?
I want some of that stuff that he's using.
And he knows as soon as he gets it in, he's like, that's it.
That's all she wrote.
Boom.
Dies.
And the Romans are like, why is he dead?
Yeah.
Interesting.
Interesting.
Let's look at the drugs that are in there.
What is he filled?
What are these?
What is this an antidote for?
Nope.
Go back to the text.
What is this an antidote for?
What is this thing?
Look at this.
Look at this.
It's on 155 and 56.
It's this.
Oracular voice inducing bread dripping honey.
And it's just beautiful and it's whiteness.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's Fez Pese oil.
It puts you into a state, baby.
You know how Jesus is with all his giving of the flesh and blood.
You know how he is.
What does he say?
It's a Fez Peseistic drug.
What does that do?
That's a regular voice, baby.
You will not have that.
Oracular voice.
If you don't have this type of drug, remember people and all the, and those earlier, and
those earlier, my beloved children, and those earlier, something got my goat.
What happened?
Can we get my goat?
Yes.
There she is.
Right?
It got my goat because I could feel it in the group.
That was a funny ripple, funny ripple.
