He's pretty slashed up too.
It's pretty slashed up too.
I hear.
Now Gibson does a heck of a slasher movie.
I love it.
What do they call those?
They used to call those snuff films.
Did you guys watch Jesus get snuffed?
I've watched it.
Did anybody else were they like, oh yeah.
Does it do anything for you like it does for me to watch Jesus get crucified?
If it does, you've probably come to the right initiation.
This is probably just consider yourself to be in the right place.
Now, I know there's varying degrees of enjoyment.
Let's be balanced about it.
Right.
Let's be balanced.
Let's bring it back to the deep sauce.
Look at this people.
Blow that up for me.
Look at this.
Okay.
Of course we've got venomous serpent.
Who's bite cause intense thirst.
Look at the sources and the candors.
The riaca.
The theriac.
Right.
An alien.
We're going to see an actual theriac tonight.
An alien.
And he puts the venomous species there.
Right.
Or as close as we can get.
We know that's a viper.
We know the aches is a viper.
Okay.
Fine.
But look at the bottom.
Look at the bottom.
What do we also refer to as deep sauce?
Remember that serpent?
Raised up in the wilderness.
Alright.
You remember that, don't you?
Alright.
Look at the bottom.
This is the acacia people.
Alright.
Mmm.
This is that desert thorn.
Yeah.
You guys know where that goes.
You guys know what you can do with that thorn.
You push it.
Yeah.
Alright.
If you were there and cool enough, you would have learned all these drug terms that I got
to learn through a library.
It's fantastic.
You get to learn the street language.
Best thing in the world.
Ancient drug users seeking drugs from the legitimate drug dealers of the day.
Yeah.
Who were concerned about things like, you know, purity, you know, effect.
Right.
Strength.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Be careful.
This gnar will knock you down.
Right.
This is the good stuff.
That's why it's so expensive.
Did you know your history was a history of junkies?
Jesus Christ was a junkie to the death.
To the death.
Now remember that serpent has to be lifted up.
That serpent has to be lifted up.
You know who I'm talking to.
You know who the audience is out there.
We got to lift up that serpent and anybody who looks at it are saved.
Yeah.
And you wondered why they said he's casting out demons by the power of the devil.
Right.
Um, Moses, that's who we're talking about, right?
Moses and all of his thing that he's doing.
Um, he's doing the very same thing.
Right.
He has written in the third century and as a character, he is doing the very same thing.
You wonder why Jesus and his boys.
Right.
By the way, it's a little bit people are like, huh?
All the apostles are teenage boys.
Well, not all of them.
Some of them are like 10 to 12.
Right.
So, you know, give them a break there.
Do you know how good it feels to say that?
Do you know how good it's, why is that one invulnerable?
Why is that fact invulnerable?
You can't, you can't deny it.
They were young.
Right.
Right.
And everybody says, oh, Peter was married.
No, it's the word for female in law.
It could be his sister in law.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there's no other record.
And by the way, he's naked on boats with other kids at night.
Yeah.
When Jesus gets there, he throws on his underwear.
Yeah.
These are the boys from Galilee.
Isn't it funny that history gives us the boys of Galilee, the young boy prostitutes
of Jesus, the trafficker.
That's what history gives us.
And what do we turn it into with our minds?
What do we create for ourselves?
The picture of, no, no, no, these are all old bearded men.
And they're at this table sitting.
Did you ever notice how the last supper doesn't feel right?
I just want to remind you of one thing.
When Jesus gave them the contact for the upper room because they needed somewhere out of
the way to take their, for Jesus to take his 12 boys to, he needed a place that was out
of the way.
And in order to find this place, he gave instructions.
He didn't give the dude's name.
Nobody ever figures out who's the saint who was that shady guy that directed the kids
to the room.
Jesus said he'll be holding a water jar, be holding this big water jug.
Just go to him.
You'll see him there in the street.
It's like, dude, he had his business set up.
He had his business set up.
He's not a laystace.
You know what Jesus worried about at night when he went to bed?
He worried about getting caught.
And he runs out in the Garden of Gethsemane at 4 a.m.
Ah, I'm not a child trafficker.
Okay, well now we're with him on the cross a few hours later and now you understand why
people are so angry.
All of a sudden there's crowds.
There's crowds screaming out, get rid of him, dude.
