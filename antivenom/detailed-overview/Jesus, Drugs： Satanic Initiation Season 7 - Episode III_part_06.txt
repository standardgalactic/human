That's why Jesus knows all that stuff about death.
That's why he's walking around raising people from the
dead.
Didn't you wonder?
Didn't you wonder why is this man walking around into
tombs and there's little kids all over these tombs and
he's raising them from the dead?
Didn't that disturb you?
You know, we're going to have to account for this.
The devil wanted me to let everybody know nobody's
getting off the hook.
Right?
Humanity worships.
Disgusting pedophile named Jesus.
Dude was arrested in a public park with a naked boy.
You don't think that you're going to go across that
event horizon.
And when you get to that actuality that we are the
reflection of, you don't think you're going to be held
responsible for supporting that?
You don't think the cosmos is all interrelated?
You don't think the Greeks were yelling about judgment
over and over and over again because they understood
how nature works?
Yeah.
We're headed for it.
We're headed for it.
Your Honor, I will give you this appeal.
I will give you this appeal, Your Honor.
We cannot abide this person.
We cannot abide this person, Jesus.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Take us back to the sources.
We're almost done.
I'm going to give you.
Yep.
Look what's going on.
Yeah.
And this is another text from the Bible.
It's referencing what they were giving him.
Right?
And here it says the wine has been smurnized.
Right?
And what is smurna?
Right?
That one he didn't take.
The one that's been smurnized.
What else are they doing with their drugs?
Flavoring or drug?
Right?
With myrrh.
With myrrh.
Oh, okay.
Remember?
Remember?
Everybody says in Bible college, what's the myrrh for?
It's an embalming drug.
They don't say drug.
They would never say drug.
It's a substance that's used in embalming.
Yeah, it is.
You know what myrrh is also used for?
You can make a hot, hot, hot, hot drug, a plaster to put
on your private parts and it will burn so good.
Oh, God.
It's got myrrh all in it.
Right?
It's a myrrh base.
You can't make sex drugs without it.
It's something to do with circulation or something.
I don't know.
Let the scientists figure out where the sex drug scientists in,
you know, people, where's your sex drugs?
You know, terrible or technology is terrible compared to what
they could do.
You know, they could give somebody an erection for a week.
A week.
When I read that, I was like, what?
That's crazy.
And the source says, yeah, but the person will die eventually.
You can't keep them that long in that state.
Huh.
Must be, I bet it's a blood pressure thing.
I bet eventually your heart just can't take it.
Yeah.
I bet it is.
You probably just keel over and they're like, oh, wait.
They have to get the medicated dildo.
We've got to get this guy with this venom stat.
Right?
Where's the priestess?
We need milk.
Right?
That's what they call it.
Milk.
It's the stuff that always saves you from the death.
So when somebody asked me, are they putting people,
are they putting people actually to death and then reviving them?
Is the person actually dead?
We know it looks like, we know it looks like they look like they're dead.
And we know they can bring them out of it.
And we know that if you don't administer the drugs to bring them out of it,
they'll die.
So I don't know.
You're putting a person on this kind of plane of halfway here,
halfway there and bringing them back, reviving them.
They're laying them out in their tombs.
You didn't know Jesus was a necromancer, kids?
Yes.
He's a necromancer.
Let's go to the source again.
Everybody in the congregation is like, you keep going.
You keep going.
I just want you to see a drug here.
I told you I'd bring you a cure.
This is the form of the frankincense.
Look at the middle line.
Ithalen de libonoton.
This is that form of frankincense.
Remember we're around the angels.
We're talking about the stuff they're burning.
Right?
That's given us the vision.
Well, this is the good stuff.
This is the good stuff of the fumigation.
And what does this stuff do?
You're not going to believe this.
It's a staltikene carcinomaton.
It is something that stops cancer.
Now, when they say cancer, they're talking about all sorts of things,
that we would break down more now and say, well, this is this and this is that.
But they use this for when they're talking about the stuff that looks like a crab on your skin.
So the skin cancers.
This is what they're talking about.
So we know this is some kind of what you and I know is cancer.
And this thing is able to stop and regress the cancer.
But it's not just the myrrh.
It's a combo.
It's a combo.
And the way they're doing it is they're misting people with it.
Misting.
You're breathing it in and it's making contact with your skin.
So it's a whole practice.
And this is sophisticated from antiquity people.
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this sophistication level here is phenomenal.
