Let's go to the next one.
Yeah.
And in the third hour, right, they crucified him.
They crucified him right about nine in the morning.
They had captured him early about somewhere three, four, four a.m.
in that range.
He'd had his stuff gone through and all that kind of stuff.
And they were like, yeah, I kill him already had a crowd.
A few hours later, they finally cleaned up the boys from Galilee and those prostitutes.
I mean, apostles, they hit the.
Do you never notice they run?
Jared, why is it in the fairy tale that all the apostles are like, oh, jigs up and they
all run?
Haven't you ever thought if you were an apostle, you would have stood there and be like, no,
no, dude, this guy's God.
Watch, I'm going to stand next to him because your asses are fried.
Right.
You would have done something like that, right?
But no, they all hit the road.
They knew it was coming.
Boom.
And they got out of town.
They got out of town.
Peter tried to come back and those little prostitutes.
Right.
They said the little female prostitute, the, the underage female prostitutes that are
in the gospels say they recognize the boys from Galilee.
Right.
You guys know that.
You guys know that.
I want you to see as Jesus is on the cross, he is still that lay stays.
Let's go to the next one.
He is still that trafficker.
What happens?
This perfect cue.
They sacrificed him between two, two lay stays.
He's got lay stays on either side of him and he's yelling when he's caught.
I'm not a lay stays.
Right.
He's yelling.
Okay.
This is what Jesus was afraid of.
You ever wonder what Jesus was afraid of?
He was afraid of getting captured as a child trafficker.
Right.
He's there with his 12.
Right.
They hit the, they hit the road.
I bet you, I bet you they could have implicated other people.
I bet you some of those women that were around Jesus's cross.
Right.
I guarantee you they were involved and you guys know, and I know some of you were looking.
Right.
And you want to find that salame and you want to find that temple thing.
You want to find those goodies because you want the real dope.
Right.
You didn't realize they were on dope.
Did you?
Yeah.
But you're a dealer at that point.
One of those women, you're a dealer.
Right.
So, you know, what do you think Lydia's got Paul?
You know what Paul is?
He's a, he's a slave.
He's a slave to a corporation that has a drug monopoly.
Yeah.
For the good stuff.
These people will give you the good stuff.
Let's go to the next text.
Oh, this is lovely.
It's all going to come to an end.
I know.
Yeah.
So this stuff.
This stuff was supposed to happen.
It's supposed to happen.
Jesus was supposed to, as the prophets were saying, you know, Jesus is supposed to be
accounted.
He's supposed to be accounted.
He's supposed to be reckoned met a normal with these lace days who are practicing
the right or the mystery of Anomia.
Right.
This was supposed to happen.
He was supposed to be crucified.
He was supposed to be destroyed amidst this circus of the Anomia that Paul says this stuff
is going on right now.
Let's go there.
Let's go to the, let's do it.
I can't take it anymore.
We just got to expose people.
Look at this.
Right.
This mystery of Anomia.
It's at work right now.
Paul says he's not talking theology people.
He's talking about the lace days.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, next one.
Boom.
And what is he saying?
Two, three.
Don't let anybody, you know, deceive you in any way.
Right.
Because the apostasia has to come.
Right.
And there then things will be opened up.
We'll see who this man of Anomia is.
This son of ruin or destruction.
The complete decimation of everything.
Who is it?
Who is this man of Anomia who hangs between them, between the lace days.
This is the fulfillment of the apocalypse.
What you get to see Christianity is your sick, disgusting God.
That's what you get to see.
This is your destruction.
That's second Thessalonians.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
Sorry.
That was a little bit.
I was a little bit jazzed up there.
Chewie, didn't you see that?
That's when it came out.
I was thinking of the empire.
No.
Okay.
Let's finish up.
Oh.
Whip.
They want more whipping.
Sorry.
We got a new.
Okay.
Fine.
Who are we whipping?
Who do people want me to whip?
Oh, okay.
Let's just whip Jesus on the cross.
He's on the cross.
Right.
We might as well.
Jesus.
