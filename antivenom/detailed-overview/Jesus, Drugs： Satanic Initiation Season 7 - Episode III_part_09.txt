Oh, I love it.
I love him sitting there.
Oh, it's thirst.
I'm so thirsty.
Give me a drink.
I'm thirsty.
Ah, sabaxon.
Ouch.
And I'm sure he said everyone's like, ouch, or something like that.
They didn't put that in the Bible.
He didn't say, oh my God, this hurts.
He was either, you know, I don't know.
I would have been complaining.
Let's go to the next one.
Let's go to the next one.
This is back to Paul again.
Tell us one more thing, Paul.
No, we're there.
Let's go back.
I want to give you guys this.
This is the last entry we've got tonight.
And this is from the Geoponica.
Yeah, those are all from the same.
These are from the Geoponica.
And this is a Byzantine manual.
It has lots of drug knowledge.
It has lots of poisons and antidotes.
They're all over the place.
So this is a great, great, great resource for us.
And I want to just read you the title of this
just so you can see that I'm not making it up.
I'm not making it up.
Classes, this will be like, huh?
Because this is not a very popular source, right?
Nobody reads this thing.
You know, shame on them.
Peri-te-ste-ri-a-queis-cai-ca-thart-i-queis-am-pe-lu.
Oh my God.
Yeah, and it's by Florentinus.
So what is this work?
This is the title of a work.
And it's on the Theriac and cathartic vine.
How do you make a Theriac and a cathartic vine?
I told you before, we're performing things
in a polypharmaceutical way.
Yeah.
And what are we doing?
We're working with the roots
and we're working with the branches.
We're grafting.
We're using poultices.
We're coating roots.
I read a section about coating roots earlier.
I was like, wow.
Wow, coating the roots in order to produce.
Now you take the fruit and then you produce it.
I'm the vine.
You make the wine.
I'm the vine and you make the wine.
And what happens with that wine?
That's the aqua ueda, baby.
That's that stuff that comes right out of her.
It comes right from Lady Babylon.
We got a cup of it.
We got a cup of it.
Would you like to try it?
Turns out it cures cancer.
Somebody should be looking at this.
Yeah.
It's our own ignorance.
Chewie, it's total ignorance on our part.
It's okay, though.
Let's go.
And here's the next section of it.
And I just wanted you to see this.
Oh, look at section number six.
I'll say, okay.
So prostas plegas for the strikes of the herpetown of those,
you know, creepy crawly things.
That can make you sick.
It helps when you drink it with wine, right?
And the okaito ex alto oxos and the oxos from it.
Do you see what they're using the oxos here for?
This is not upon the Christ on the cross.
This is on the Christ elsewhere.
Look at the one, two, three, the fourth line down.
Second word in epichiae.
Do you know what they're doing?
They're Christing.
Where are they Christing?
Here, they're Christing the roots.
Here, they're Christing the roots.
Now, why would you be Christing roots?
Because you want that to produce that intoxicating chemical.
You want it to take it, to process it, and to put it out in a way
that you can use it then within your right.
It will take you to a place
into death and back to life.
Bacchus, baby.
This is all Bronze Age Bacchic pulp.
And Jesus is plugged right into it.
He's plugged right in our last source tonight.
And I'll let you guys go.
This is just a fun one.
Yeah, this is that paganites.
Wait, it's the paganites wine.
What is that?
Some kind of Rue wine or something?
Yeah, what's it used for?
Well, first of all, it's really, you know, it's a, it's thematic.
It is a heating wine, right?
And it's used for, against these, any class of drug that is going to
tend to overthrow your body, right?
And what else?
It's an Alexa pharmacos.
It's an Alexa pharmacos of, that we use against the reptiles,
against those crawly venomous things.
Yep, take it down.
Wait a minute.
You've got a wine that does that?
Yes, we have a wine.
And it's a complex compound formula and it has to be manufactured,
manufactured through that vessel of nature.
This is your problem.
This is why you don't have the, why the medicine is not where the
medicine should be if we didn't have that thousand ages of,
that thousand years of dark ages.
Thank you very much.
It took us backwards.
We'll catch up to where the Greeks were pretty soon.
We'll catch up to them.
Yeah.
And with the technology that we will have developed,
we'll be able to rerun civilization.
I just want to end by saying tonight that that
Ogduad, that eighth that was and is not, but will be,
the restoration of that beast will bear up Lady Babylon.
Thank you for coming tonight.
We'll see you next Wednesday.
Hail Satan.
Thank you.
