Drankin' whiskey, when that whisky's burnin'
Do my veins, indian goes crazy
And the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you got your
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Wednesday night
Bible study, it's so nice to have you here
I know that we have Jude loaded in the cannon
Ready to go, so I will not waste your time
Tonight we're going to work our way
Through a little bit of bottle air
But just as a whiff for us to have a perfume
And then we will call up some ghosts
And I'm going to just give you
Your first taste of a deposition
Of a deposition, so we're detectives
Remember, we're here for a reason
And tonight on Lady Babylon
Yes, yes, I didn't want to start the fire
So quickly, but I want you to know
Hey, it's going to be hot tonight
I'm going to be talking, dressing directly
All of those of you who are unsatisfied
You know who you are, I'm talking to you
Wives, Protestants and Catholics alike
I'm talking to you
Yes, tonight we're going to begin
With putting these people in the place
Where they must be as we sit atop
The throne, yes, is that nice?
Welcome, you didn't think that
I was going to leave off the stuff
About the slaves, did you?
Yes, welcome, welcome to tonight's slave auction
Fantastic, this is going to be fantastic
Set the stage for us, will you?
Will you Chewie?
Chewie's going to zip us right ahead
I want you guys to absorb this
This is going to give you a little
Sweet reticling, little right images
In the right places, hit it Chewie
Please do unravel it all
I feel sorry for you
Oh, that's going to be a little hard to do
Out on the back roads
Inside the forbidden zone
Followed by ghosts
Growing up alone
I lost everything
That I ever wrote
Your overseer is back
Your overseer is back and guess what?
If you are a woman, he wants you to submit
He wants you to submit, right?
So I'm standing with the watchers in there
We're trying to understand this, guys
We're really trying to understand this
But you've got a guy, where'd he go?
Paul, get over here, I know it hurts
