But that's the way it is
You signed up for this
Now tell me something, Paul
Tell me something, Paul
Stop crying, stop crying, Paul
Yeah, yeah
That's where we are
We've got Paul the Apostle here
And he belongs to us
And he is saying
If you are a dude at
Do not apply
Right, right
And now that we have mixed
I mean, some women
Stepped up and became teachers
And now we have a problem
We have a problem because you see
The whole cult
As reformed by Paul
His particular brand, flavor
And it runs through Catholicism
And it runs through Protestantism
It runs through all the isms
Love it
It runs through that girl sitting on her bed
Praying, Jesus, Jesus, I love you
And I know that you died from my sins
Jesus, it runs through her
It runs through her
Right through her
Ha
Ladies
Get out of the market, says St. Paul
I don't let any woman
Teach over me
Yeah, I don't appoint any of them
Nope, no women
You got women? What does it say from the time?
It says they had some women who stepped up
Right? It says they had some women
Who stepped up and Paul didn't like it
Paul didn't like it
But this is the divine word of God
It's the divine word of God
So what are we to believe?
Nothing
We're just going to look at what the actual words say
That's all we're going to take from that
Now, I'm going to set us up here
One more time, we've got to go through one more wave
We're not quite there yet
We're going back, but we're not quite there yet
Jude's waiting in the wings
He's afraid now because of what I've been doing
He knows that I'm going to take you on the way of Cain
This is so great, you guys
Everybody buckle up
Do you remember those wandering stars
That we found back there with those mithrists
When we took that little girl up for her initiation
Do you remember that?
Do you remember what she said?
