This is it.
Medea and the snake charmers
Dragon venom think of vipers
Make you hemorrhage blood, hemlock whoops bang
Lavender moon rise, they're out of the game
Electrical blood, bind you with wonderful drugs
Raw opium drips, hail Satan in the dark harbor
Open your eyes, give you vision
Go to the serpent temple
And take some dragon venom
The power of the black mirror
I'm with the root cutters, the darn bringers
Medea the sorceress, Venus producer of the sweetest nectars
Dance with the muse, the radio specter
The muse sings of me
Whisper left face
Hold my heart so dear
Dancing in a dream
