And if you take that bird
And you nail it to that wheel
It'll scream
Wait what
You know what this is all for

Bad on me
Excuse me

Boom
What is it not a notice
Well it is this canidos
So here look what I'm doing people
I'm bringing you from the grave
I'm bringing you the person who is defining it
And ultimately remember this ends up from
Going from Ezekius to his
The real source of this dictionary
Which is an Alexandrian
Gramarian
And he says the canidas is the nan naris
Nan naris
And wow
How do I know
You know I'm an attic
Great dude walking around

Nan naris

Oh right it's using the same root
Which is probably Pulascian
And what does it mean
It means to pyzomenon
And you'll recognize
My Greek students will recognize the root
For the child in their pice
Is the root for child
What is
What do you do when you pyzomenon
Well if you ask the Victorians
They'll say you play sportively
To engage in youthful amorous play
Youthful amorous play
That is what the canidas does
Jesus Christ was arrested
With a slave
Who was a boy
And who was naked
He was assigned to Jesus

This yonks is also called sasa pygis
That is the quaking of the buttocks
Yeah and why is this
It's because by the way
Who am I reading to you

This is the skoliast
On theocratist's ittle number two
So this is one ancient Greek
Talking about another famous
Ancient Greeks work
Okay skoliast
They're commenting on the work
And this commenter here says
What is the yonks
Because in theocratist's second ittle
Which is about the witches
And the sorcery
He mentions the bird
The bird is central
Right what is the bird here
The bird is known to turn around
And shake its booty
They call her yunga
Callimachus told her about her
She's the daughter of echo
Wait what
She's the daughter of echo
And what does she do
Well we know what was done to her
Zeus drugged her
God drugged her
Why so he might sleep with her
When Hera found out
She turned her into a bird
Why so that she could work
Power of witchcraft
Power of the drugs
Isn't that gorgeous

Look at number two at the bottom
Right and by the way
This is the standard word for buttocks
In ancient Greek
How do we define the buttocks
We define the buttocks
By staring at aphrodites
Isn't that interesting
What do they call aphrodite
They call her calipigenus
That's her epithet
She of the beautiful buttocks
She of the beautiful buttocks
How do you define
That's not the
Listen we got to turn it around
Come on she
We got to falcon on the wrong side
She of the beautiful buttocks
That's how
Let's go back to the buttocks
Because at the bottom of the buttocks
You're going to find something
Look here

Ura

Right so we're at the buttocks
And if you just move down a little bit
You're going to see the ura

The ura is what Satan used
To draw down a third of the angelic powers
Now for those of you who are sitting
On the throne of Satan
Hail Satan

On the throne of Satan
