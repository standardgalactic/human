Hanging off the bottom there
And uh oh
What else
You know
Yeah
I just got to say
Go ahead and leave it up
The God who left the ewa
With the best looking being
And a tree full of drugs
That God wasn't thinking
I don't know
There's bad planning
Okay Yahoo
If there's one thing I can say
Bad planning
What is the ura
That Lucifer is so well known
That Serpent is so well known for using
Look at number two
Eidoyun
Eidoyun
Do you mean his tail is his Eidoyun
Yes
Some of us listening tonight
Have an Eidoyun
Or Eidoya
Many of us have Eidoya
Yes
Those are our tails
By which we
Who are the most beautiful
Command of the universe
Who's kingdom is this
Who's kingdom is this
Says Jesus
Jesus tell me
Tell me Jesus
Who's kingdom is this
It's kingdom of the devil
Isn't that nice
That's the ura
Do you understand it
Go to the next one
Go to the next one
Quick hit him with this
Before they wake up
Watch
Here we go
This is part of the commentary
I just want to pull out this
Scoliasis and say
Look
We get a really good explanation
Of Priapus here
Right
Priapus is that child of Dionysus
And the Nymphniad Keene
Right
You know
He's associated with Lamsicus
You know
And some people say
With Dionysus himself
And they prove this
I'm translating
From the etymology
Look at it
Oh God
Look at this
Third line down
The fourth word in etymology
Yes
That's the word for etymology
Oh God
Oh it's so good
It's so good
It's the good that says
Don't show it from the waist down
Fantastic
Priapus
Now
Why are we concerned about Priapus
And the etymology of his name
Just hang in there
Let's see
It's all wrapped up together nicely
Connected beautifully
In this beautiful tapestry of history
Written history
Oh here we go
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Because I want to explain
What the Scoliasis says
And this is theochris
Theochris is a Hellenistic poet
By the way people
Right
Like the Hellenistic poet
Yeah
Theochris
Itals
Talking about magic
Talking about bringing back your lover
You want to call back your lover
Here we go
What
One before this Chewie
One before us
We've got one star system ahead
There we go
And look
What does he say here
About the etymology
Right
It actually is not Priapus
He says
It's Priapus
Sticks the diagram
And that
Upsilon in there
And what is this for?
This is because they're referencing
He says
The Bacchic dance of intoxication
That involves all the shouting
The shouting
Right
The shouting
And he's arguing that etymologically
From this next star system
Go to the next one
Boom
Look here
Apio
Apio
Are you ready?
What does it mean?
It means some kind of roaring
Some kind of vocalization
Right
In the middle
It can be
To summon
Right
Ooh, I like that
I like that so much
It's that voice
That magic voice that calls
Can you hear it?
I love it
Go back to the
One more time with the text above that
Now people
What does he say at the very bottom?
He says in Priapus
Some people say Priapus
Comes from
Uh-oh
When I said Sperma
You probably got it
What is it to project the sperm?
To project the Sperma
When you
Does everybody see what that moment is
Of that rush
That
Bruh
That shouting
That vocalization
That brings the forecast
The throwing out
The injection into the world
Of that Sperma
Because we all know
We all know
That the universe
Is born from seed
The universe is born from seed
We are farmers
Our universe is cultivation
You know where religion comes from?
Some people have been saying
Comes from the drugs
No, the drugs are a part of it
But it doesn't come from the drugs
It comes from the nature
Yeah
It comes from nature herself
Oh, wow
Wow
Imagine understanding the world
From that perspective
Okay, here we go
That's Priapus
And that's why he's necessary
