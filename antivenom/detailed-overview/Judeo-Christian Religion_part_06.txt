All of that religious garbage
Doesn't use the evidence
It doesn't look at the evidence
It has no reality to it
No underground
It's built on sand
It's built on pure sand
I love this stuff
Where's the lace-dace?
Do you want to know what the lace-dace is?
Let's show you one
Let's show you Alexander
Because people have been asking me
Lace-dace, lace-dace
Alexander the False Prophet is one
And what does he do?
He orders his boys according to their looks
They got to be tall
They can't have pimples
Have a clear compulsion
They got to be the cream of the crop, he says
Yes, okay
And what can you do with your boys?
You can drug them
You can drug them?
Yes
They're little factories, people
It's ancient pharmacology
Where did that gigantic...
Where did that gigantic...
I was waving this around
It's one of my copies of Galen
Today, I was looking at it
It's volume 12
Oh, it's right here, Chewie
It's volume 12
Take a look at this, people
People, take a look at this
This is volume 12 from 1826
And what is it?
It's one of the pharmaceutical volumes
You mean that is all an ancient Greek dude
Riding about drugs
All of that
All, every page
Every page
Oh, my God
Wow
The sophistication here
You got to have respect for it
You really got to have respect for it
Get us back up
What is that?
The converter?
All right, it's plugged in
Fantastic
Go to the next one
Let's keep... come on
We got to keep people in that zone
For those of you who missed the Bible
I just wanted to throw in Micah
Come here, Micah
Come here, Micah, the prophet
This is made up in the third century
But here we go
What happens?
God is going to destroy utterly the drugs
Your drugs, not just the drugs
Your drugs
He's going to destroy them right out of your hands
You greedy drug thugs
And what?
And all of those elevated thoughts
That you get from them
What?
What?
Yes
Yes, Yahoo's back at the party
Right, Yahoo's back at the party
He told the devil he was like
Watch the drugs
Watch them
Yeah, what do you think the devil did?
She was...
You don't understand
You just don't understand
That's the problem
That's the real difference between the devil and Yahoo
Jehovah Hashem
That's the big difference between Hashem and Satan
Yeah
It always comes down to Aphrodite
It always comes down to Aphrodite
Who do you think it is that gives you all the generation?
Why do you think that Romans walked around so proud
To be the children of Aphrodite?
Oh, God
Okay, you're almost there
If you're that much closer to the mystery name of power
That is Roma
If you've captured that name yet
You just got a whiff of it right there
Do you feel it?
You just got a whiff of it
The medwa is the awa
Is the awa
And you set her up with the ademas
And in their presence
You brought him
You brought the best looking men
With a whole bunch of sex drugs
And you didn't think they would end up naked
You pervert
Oh, my God
Your religion is built upon an orgy
Now it was fabricated in the third century
Fabricated in the third century
Let's go
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
We're getting into it
I want to give you some verses
Look, we're going to end on this
We're going to end on this
Tonight, I'm going to bring you back to creation
What is written below is the Greek
It says in the beginning
God made Uranos and Gaia
Uranos and Gaia
And Gaia was Aoratos
And Akataskeostos
Now, I'm just going to show you
This is the passage that says
The earth was Aoratos
I'm going to show you how this is
A more technically advanced work
Than what the Hebrew is
This cannot be a translation of Hebrew
You cannot take a non-technical term
And jazz it up or translate it
Into a technical term
You can't do that
You can go the other way
You can lose tech
You can't gain it
That's how Mother Nature works, baby
That's the way up
Let's go to the Tower of Babel
Are you ready?
So the earth is Aoratos
Let's see, what is the earth?
It's Aoratos
Give me the next slide
What is Aoratos?
Please, I don't mean to be a whole yelly
Here it is
I just wanted you to see it
Aoratos, see the last word
I just blew it up, right?
Aoratos
Can you see it?
Everybody in Greek should be wondering
What is Aoratos?
It is unseen or invisible
And you can see this is just Horao
The Greek verb to see
Plus the alpha-privilege
Ah, that's not true
It doesn't take much to figure that out
It's the unseen or the invisible
Notice they say
Aoratos is the unseen world
Now look what the Greek is doing
It's taking a concept
And it's taking it out of the abstract
Adjective form
The description
And it's turning it into the concrete
It's making it a noun
And Greek is exceptionally good at doing this
And as a result
The unseen becomes that
Which is unseen
The unseen world
Do you know what the unseen world is?
Do you know what the unseen world is?
No, of course you don't, right?
Because this author
Who is writing the Torah
Is faking it
They are creating something
Not passing down documents
They are creating
It is a Greek creation
Oh, are you kidding?
Do you know how much that changes history?
Oh my God
