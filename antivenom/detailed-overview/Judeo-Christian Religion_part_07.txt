It's no wonder
Israel and Tel Aviv, Finkelstein
It's no wonder
You were there
We found that Canaanite Temple
At the bottom of Megiddo
You know that thing they call
Solomon's blank fortress
You know it's not that
There's no archaeological evidence
This is a forged history
It's a forged history
Fantastic, right?
Now, presumably
They want you to thank scribes
And scholars
And Sadducees
And sectists
And zealots
People in deserts
With pots
And the end is coming
That kind of people, right?
The people with the knowledge
Of the box
The monist box
Because what monism does
And Akhenaten taught us this
And I'm Amon
Hail Satan
Akhenaten
Is the one who's bringing
First brought that monist box
Everybody in the box
Anybody outside the box
Is killed
That's all there is to it
It's the form of genocide
That makes the basis
Of the volcano of monist religions
It's that magma
It's ultimately going to blow
Yes, fantastic
Not so fantastic
Right, that's how much is it
Not so fantastic
The watchers, thank you
Suck, by the way
Go to the next one
Look at this
What do they make of the
That which is unseen
What do they do with the unseen world?
Right?
The translators
Who are trying to create a Hebrew text
From the Greek Septuagint
It's very complex
Formless confusion
Unreality, maybe emptiness
Doesn't it sound like a shotgun?
Sounds like a shotgun, bro
Did you hit that
The linguists that are working on this
Did you guys hit that with a shotgun?
Were you like, oh, I don't know
But here, this is bound to hit something
It's from an unused word
What the?
I dare you to find
I dare you to find any classical philologist
Whatever, say this
From an unused word
It sounds like your Hebrew
Your ancient Hebrew is a forgery
It sounds like you're making it up
From the Greek
Did you know there are words in Greek
That are way older
The Hebrew adapts to its own
In the Septuagint
It makes, it creates roots
It's a forgery
The Torah, the Old Testament
The Pentateuch
The Books of Moses
A forgery
A forgery
Wow
Wow, why would you do such a thing?
Why would you forge something like that?
It's appropriation, it's to claim legitimacy
Right?
It's that fight, that eternal fight
Between us and what is foreign
Yeah
It happens over and over again
In history and ultimately it ends up
In a genocidal rainstorm
Yeah, it's amazing
Amazing
Monism is dangerous
It's the most dangerous quantum chemical
In existence
And in reflection
Yeah, it's that reflection poison
Let's go, let's go to the next one
What is akata?
So you can see that the Hebrew
Is not able to approximate
What is akata skewastos?
Now look at this word
You can just look at this
What else is the world in creation?
It's akata skewastos
Now you can see from this Greek
That this is not a short little word
This thing is built
Not only does this thing have a root
But it's also got a prefix
And an alpha-private
Okay, now watch how the meaning changes
What is this thing?
Akata skewastos
What is an earth that is that?
We'll start with skewastos
That means something prepared by art
Right, it's artificial
As opposed to futeltos
And what is futeltos?
That is something that has fuo
That has nature
That's been engendered
That's been engendered
And this word skewastos
Is used of drugs
Right, why?
Because drugs are prepared
They're artificial constructions
When they're talking pharmacos
They're not talking plants
Now they're talking all of the plant substances
That we're combining and treating with this
And with this wash
And we do this six months later
It turns out you take this stuff
And it turns you into frankenstein
Right, okay
What is this thing here?
Look, it's a drug
But look at gala in there at the bottom
It also uses sumi amata
What are sumi amata?
Those are things that you inhale
And there's a, you know, pre-stess
And she's singing
And she's burning some stuff
And after a while, you fly in with the group
Welcome
Welcome to Bacchic air
Please put your seats in their fully back position
With your feet up in the air
Yes, fantastic
Fantastic, brought to you by the virgin
Oh, is this that virgin?
This is the dark one
This is the dark one
This is the Malinnoi
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
Malinnoi
That dark mind
Hmm, beautiful
You knew if I was going to talk about the magic of the catamites
You knew that I would have to bring her in
Right, she's the queen
Let's go to the next one
Hmm, so what happens with that scewo stos
When I add kanta to it, watch the Greek form real concepts
Artificial as opposed to autofuis
Self-generated, right?
Under artificial conditions
And then suborned when you talk about people
Being suborned
Oh, God
Now, let's add an alpha privative to the front of it
Watch how it changes the meaning
What is this thing?
Out of the Bible
Akata scewo stos
Not properly prepared
In the first example, there was a pharmacon
Right?
Unformed
Unwrought
Unpolished
Now, give me the next one, please
Give me the next one
