What is the...
Hesekius, what do you think of Akata scewo stos?
You think it's afilokalaton
Afilokalaton
Look at that beautiful long word
It's kale plus filo plus ah
On the front of it, what does it mean?
What does it mean? I'm chasing these words
I think I'm ecstatic or something
Because they seem to all be connected
Afilokalatos means without adornment
Without adornment
Okay
How is it going to be translated into Hebrew?
This term
Are you ready?
Here we go
Emptiness
Now, you can hear it
You can hear it
If I just explained everything I explained to you
To a third grader
They would say
Emptiness
Yes
Yes, do you see
What the Hebrew scholars were doing?
Hebrew was so dead
That they only had 8,000 words to work with
And the best that you can do is come up with something
That sounds like the epic of Gilgamesh
It's just a fact of nature
Mother Greek is a monstrous
She's a monstrous
Let's keep going
Watch this, I'm going to do it with another verse
Are you ready?
And the darkness was all over the
Abusu
All over the what?
Abusu
What is an Abusu?
Give me the next one
It is a perazukhekon
Something that has no peraz
No boundary
It is an infinite
It has no stops to it
The Abyss has no
Give me the next one
How are we going to define it with the Victorians?
It's bottomless, unfathomed
And they talk about Pagai
Springs
Unfathomable, boundless
Right, boundless
Now look at definition number 2
What is it when you take this word
And Greek does this
This is again the power of the language
Now that adjective bottomless
Unfathomed
Which by the way puts the
What is unfathom?
That's the mind of Zeus
Nice, the thoughts anyway
The council
What is it?
It's the great deep
It's the underworld
It's the infinite
Wait, no, leave that one out
What is it when it says the great deep here
That's from the Septuagint
And underneath that
Is the Gospel of Luke
The Epistle to the Romans
And the Apocalypse
Wait a minute, I think we have a Victorian
I think we have a Victorian who's messing with us
Do you see what happens?
We're trying to define
A word based upon its neighborhood
And its neighborhood is a select text
Group of text, the New Testament and the Septuagint
And that's it
They're trying to create a special
Divergent definition
And this is a no-no
This is a no-no
Let's keep going
Go to the next one
Watch this people
Boom, what do we do with it?
Third grade man
Raka
An extended surface or an expanse
A surface or an expanse
Do you see how basic that is?
A surface or an expanse
Okay, so my tech is dropping
I'm losing my tech
Give me one more example
I'm going to show you this one more time
Now you'll be able to predict it yourself
Or was that the one more? Did we skip one?
Yeah, here's the
Now, the Stena Oma
Everybody's heard this translated
It's a firmament
Firmament, right?
Okay, I didn't include this
The firmament
What is that firmament?
Well, let's see what the Stena Oma is
Blow that up for me, please
It's a solid body
And you'll notice right after it
They quote annexagoras
Okay, uh-oh
Now you're talking about some pretty complex
Cosmology
Right, okay, fine
Immaterial solids
Foundation or framework
For example, it's the skeleton
On which the body is, as it were, built
It is that solid foundation
Now look at number three
This will throw you
What is this?
It's also the Stata
Now, the person here argues
It's the one that the Stata
That has to do with the ship
The Stata that has to do with the ship
But watch this
Next one
Boom
What is the Stata?
That's the one that they say
No, you can't have anything to do with that
That has not brought forth
No children, no makings
Wait, what, a heifer?
Yup
Can also just be a woman who is barren
Who has not produced
Now notice right in the smack dab
Middle of this is the Orphic Lithica
I've got a student shout out to Ion
Who's reading the Orphic Lithica right now
Okay, be careful, you've got Orphic Vox
Going on, right?
Right, look at this
Look at the bottom of that paragraph
That's number two, Roman numeral number two
It says Fusus and Psyche
Right?
Do you see what's happening?
The Virgin
The Virgin steps forward
The Virgin steps forward
Now, wait a minute
Before we go, give me the picture of that Virgin
Back again, whoever
Whoever you had programmed in for
Fantastic
So
You mean the Virgin
Is she
Who separates the waters
Yup
And if you and I are on Cyprus
We know
Who that is
She comes right out of those waters
She's the one who has the seed
And perpetuates everything
Yeah
That Priapus
That is the spirit
Of the Leistice
Who overcomes the Canidus
Because the reason the Canidus is so important
And why Jesus has one is
You have to have that poison
Along with that
Canidus' ejaculate
You have to have its Priapus
Right?
You have to have that force
Or it won't work
Physiologically, it won't work
And it's dangerous
Because what they're painting
That scene done with
