I appreciate you supporting me before the channel started and I'd like to give you some
good content now.
Today is the first in a series that I'll present to you in which I will turn to
a variety of practitioners who feed upon the myth of antiquity. These are nostics in the flesh.
These folks are possessed by ancient demons and I've got one here with us today.
So everybody please meet Dr. John Price. He is at the leading edge of the
Jungian world and he will determine the future of how this art develops. You can consider him a
master. John would you just regale us with some of your background? I think you overstate
you slightly overstate my position although it's appreciated but I would lead by saying there are
real masters that I look to and their insights are held in books and in experiences and
I consider myself a student and a humble student and somebody who is
consistently curious and ready to learn and be receptive and to learn and I do think that
any teacher really does need to be very clear about how much of a student they really are
and as soon as they stop that they become they turn into if you stop with like the
the richness and the curiosity of a student you just you become kind of stale and there's no
the buddhist call it beginner's mind this shenri or shizuki wrote a story wrote a book called
beginner's mind so I try to approach this content because we're dealing as you said with mysteries
and I certainly can't make any any concrete belief out of what is beyond so I think Jung is a really
good intermediary who studied the psyche and the psychology of what I would say on some level
and this is a pretty large statement but studied the kind of the known the the ways in which we
consciously relate to the unknown and so he was really able to say I don't need to make theological
assertions I can just talk about what's happening psychologically so that's kind of my
lane is to be in the world of psychology and looking at most of what comes up in the mysteries
from the perspective of psychotherapeutic intervention and ways in which that psychology
can help us understand how the perennial nature of the mysteries exists in pretty radical ways
that we continue to to see throughout culture and throughout history so I think it's important
John that people recognize that you've been talking about mystery and its operation and you are
yourself a practitioner the audience should know that you have you have been to places and seen
things that many of us would find difficult to deal with and you are at this nexus of human
suffering and medicine and so when you talk about mysteries I think people people were listening to
this should appreciate the fact that you're talking about the practical application of those
ancient forces because you talk a little bit about I um I wanted you to tell the audience
who you're um education wise where you've been and tell us about this think tank excellent
and your involvement with them so I got two bachelor's degrees one in interpersonal communication
in speech communication it was kind of a way of navigating the complexities of public spaces
and and speaking to people and I thought it was great but primarily I was interested in just
getting a degree because I was playing music at the time I was really my my heart and my interest
and then given a series of wild events I was put into a therapist's office or I chose that
sounds bad I I I sought out a therapist and I thought that it was pretty magical what was
happening in that space I I'd primarily been pretty guarded or protected against going into
those places I think for good reason because being self-reflective is and I'm moving into
discomfort it's voluntarily moving into discomfort because what we learned consistently from all
of our religious traditions is that one of the fundamental natures of human reality is that we
suffer and so the the inevitability of facing that suffering is just what you get for the
cost of admission into this reality as a human so I was in that space for myself and my young's
very interested in what's called the wounded healer and of course that is a thread that permeates
the healing arts that that those who've been hurt either it's not so either or but we could
say the spectrum is those who've been hurt can tend to hurt other people taking out that hurt on
others or that can be transmuted into something that becomes kind of a healing endeavor where we
work to heal and to repair people with what's been separated or fragmented or hurt or amputated
or cut off or whatever language you want to use and you're dealing with people who
have been victims of sexual trauma for example real dark difficult places to go right I mean
that's you you crawl into those spaces right that's the the training when I did my my second
bachelor's degree I was trained in what's called trust-based relational intervention so it's working
with children from trauma working in primarily adoption and foster care so as you can imagine
in those communities there's a lot of darkness you know the hidden I don't mean evil of course
there is is that but these are parts of development that are hidden and that are rejected and are
disowned and so when when any of us are so for that burden of not being connected and in a meaningful
way with what psychoanalysts call a one good enough parent a good enough source of nurturing
then we we really struggle later on so the course of my development involved childhood trauma I I
