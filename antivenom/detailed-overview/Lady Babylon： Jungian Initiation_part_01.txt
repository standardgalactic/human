got a master's in clinical psychology and I worked a lot with adolescents and I was looking at addiction
and certain spiritual pathways including Buddhism as a as a way of kind of healing addiction and
then I started my doctorate in Jungian psychology and that's when things got weirder you know like
they and I love that it got really weird really quick and because I started studying religion
and religions and philosophy and metaphysics and anthropology and just touching on all those
arenas but primarily looking at it through the lens of of healing and therefore hurt and how
you know how we get hurt and how we can live out that hurt or look consciously at that hurt
and try to not repeat it in ways that are unconscious so for those of us who are living
in the apocalypse and about to enter the second half what do you do what do you do for us you
know recently I saw that stress related mental illness is up and trauma lots of trauma lots of
lots of forceful trauma out there what do you do how do you intervene using your magic that
Esalen is a is a really wonderful institute a learning institute an experientially based
learning institute that started in the 60s ideas kind of in the late 50s I can't recall but I
actually in my podcast I interviewed Jeff Kreipel who's really involved in Esalen and he's written
the book on Esalen and I interviewed him maybe a year ago as I was heading out there to do my first
retreat on fame I was looking at the psychology of fame and shadow and not necessarily fame from
the perspective of the celebrity just how all of us seek to be known or seen I mean that's typically
where we feel the most wounded as if we've been seen and and where we feel alone and isolated
is a place that hurts and so fame being seen or being renowned is kind of the antidote or viewed
to be the antidote to this existential angst of aloneness so and I wanted to see the way that
our culture plays that out those shadow patterns so Esalen is is a real center point of counter
culture movements you know where all of the all that can't be included in the popular discourse
of the academy or of more social spaces you know given that as you increase the amount of people
in one situation in one setting it waters down or sanitizes the ability for us to
not be ideologically minded because I think as we get larger in population we take these shortcuts
and our identity and kind of borrow from others and we don't do the heavy lifting so I think real
religious um early religious groups or communities were small groups of communities so Esalen is a
small group I'm not saying they're religious in fact they would Jeff would talk about something
like they he says nobody captures the flag at Esalen meaning that nobody really lands on a
certain ideological approach whether it be spiritually religiously or metaphysically
although there is a pretty strong current of idealism or against physicalism which
to your point you know I think and I may be going way far afield here that
we have we have done a really good job as human beings of creating a lot of creature comforts you
know one of the things we do is create tools and extensions for us to battle against discomfort
and achieve elements of pleasure you know whenever we can and so what happens is systematically we
get a little bit detached from um from suffering from our own suffering because we spend so much
time trying to get out of suffering so places like Esalen for example are these meaningful
centers that have allowed um conversation and experience that really matters that's kind of
beneath what the larger culture would say is uh is appropriate or necessary and Esalen's been really
thinking for a long time about these counter cultural movements um how to how to give a
space for people to have the conversations that maybe aren't be having aren't aren't had in public
spaces so from from my experience there it was leading a workshop last year on fame and shame
fame and shadow and then this coming year in 2023 uh with my friend and kind of co-conspirator
Rodney Waters who's a training union analyst he'll finish in Zurich next year with his diploma in
analytic training and he's a classically trained pianist and I'm I've got a background in music
and so we're doing a workshop on music and ecstatic experience and of course drawing
from a lot of these mysteries currents you know we're we're looking at Pythagoras and
Egyptian tonal tonal traditions that chance the way that the the I and I'm speaking like a neophyte
here but the the way these vibrations are are on a cosmic and archetypal level manifested in our
personal consciousness and how certain frequencies and tones can be used in ways to generate alternate
states of knowledge and experience so we're running this workshop on how to how to create those
experiences using music and tapping into these currents of antiquity. John I have to I have to
interrupt you and confess it's beginning to beginning to sound a little culty.
What do you mean by that man? I can smell the the ancient incense in the air I'm wondering I'm
wondering. It's only because I'm burning some in here right now. Since we're since we're in the
beginning of what's inevitably going to be the psychedelic renaissance and now the psychotropic
drugs have made it into the you know possible treatments for different medical problems medicine
is this inevitable that it's going to make it up to you that it's going to make it up to the people
who are on the front who are dealing with these victims of incredible trauma. I'm wondering do you
see a place do you see a place for integrating the kind of ancient practices that they were doing
