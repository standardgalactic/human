in antiquity with the drugs and the the initiations and the ceremony that reinforces specific images
the things that give you the idea that you're born again. Do you think those ancient magic
practices ancient cults do you think that they have any bearing on the future the potential
future tell us the future John. Well I think they already do I mean I think that in large part
that's one of the reasons why I'm studying them is because for example in psychotherapeutic
traditions right now it we're very interested in what can be measurable you know it's it's
kind of shifting but for a long time behaviorism started coming into fashion and so of course what
could be measured and observed was what mattered and it's kind of a dire a dominant way of seeing
seeing the world it's also an extension of how we operate you know what what we can't
taste touch feel see and measure in some way we reject and this is what I mean William Blake was
talking about this this has been a current that's existed for a long time I draw from his well because
I think for a long time I was drawing from his well I was reading a lot from Blake when he was
taking on the empiricism of scientism which is a limitation it's a scientist is a process
it's a very good process it's an important process that we that we need to use to provide structure
in how we interact with mystery how we come to know what we know but what happens is it becomes
something that reifies itself and of course believes it's exclusively the pathway to understanding
and to gaining knowledge and what these earlier traditions are really looking at is that knowledge
is not limited by what can be determined scientifically knowledge can exist in what we
would call in the imagination and so we're really playing with attention between a dominant
cultural norm of what can we you know the sensory systems what we can measure what can be objectively
true versus these other forces these unseen forces that exist that we can relate with or relate with
us and we can at times connect in a conscious way with these forces and and and emerge in a
transformed way so trauma you keep talking about trauma trauma I think first of all trauma is
inevitable we're all traumatized there are moments in which we are overwhelmed by energies that we
are not ready to contain okay okay hang on with that thought right there because now you're making
me afraid you're making me afraid because what you're saying is is you know you're still squarely
in the cult realm right but you now you're drawing on ancient forms of possession and things that
you're going to get some resistance if I can be an oracle for a minute you're going to get
resistance to this am I not right I mean you're basically using sorcery on people to program them
to give the problem with this yeah the problem with this is that we've allowed for the idea of
sorcery to take on an exclusively negative connotation and rather than talking about working with
immeasurable forces and unseen aspects of our nature from intuition to you name it
what what what what this is saying essentially is because intuition or because these energies we
could say aren't subjected to the kinds of modeling that we currently have we reject them
and so and and there are earlier times in our existence that didn't subject the knowledge that
they possess to these restrictive and limited ways of engaging with consciousness or with these
kind of mysterious forces so I think in some way it's really a cultural critique it's that our
culture hasn't really allowed for us to be in a both and kind of space where we can have room for
um ceremony and ritual and incense and placebo whatever that may mean these
connection and relationship you know go to a hospital there's no relationship
there are and I don't mean I I maybe I'm speaking too too feeling I know hospitals are really trying
but if you're really trying to heal like genuinely trying to heal you're going to include certain
images like nature you're going to allow for certain patterns like sleep you're going to
help promote really healthy eating and and allow for the body to heal because you know a body and
you know how about course can you have orgies well now I mean see that's when you say stuff
like that it's like where the come from like what is that you know like and so I don't know I don't
know the one thing I do want to note here that's so important is I I think sometimes what people
can do is look to the past to try to replicate what was done there's a reason that christians call
them temple prostitutes right the vocabulary is hilarious but what do we do John is there's some
way of getting my audience naked in the wilderness um in in an attempt to in an attempt to bring them
back to uh an understanding of reality and of history are you one of these guys who who they're
talking now about the brain and the fact that it has a quantum aspect to it which I don't know why
that surprises anyone but okay um how how do you think it's worth let me ask this question do you
think it's worth perpetuating bringing the mystery now this this whole series is about Lady Babylon
and her cup her cup of pornea and that's why ultimately you know I brought us to the orgy
um can we do this John can we bring this back in order to heal all of this incredible trauma
it's it's funny you say that I think certainly there we let me try to work through this it's
not necessarily going back as if it's linear I think what we're saying is that hey we have these
tendencies and patterns that have started to take us over that don't really serve us and we want to
live a more full existence and and something about these cult traditions like like not not
