you're under the influence of some very strong formulae that i'm translating and that are
beautifully intricate we have no idea what that nobody's gonna be able to figure out that chemistry
but say i've put you rob onto the venom you're on the venom now and you're you're working with
john where's your mind confident confident in john is just one a certain amount of rapport
with me through the integrity that is approached that with so now i'm i'm with john and the next
thing he might say could be relevant and i might take it on board a little bit easier than i would
have done if he'd said something different if you know i mean if he hadn't come over so genuine
i might not have taken that on board so easy does that make any sense did he just did he just
figure out one of your tricks john well yeah i mean i wouldn't it's not so and this is great trick
um so so the way we function like these are just truths of truth capital t
as i said it earlier that there's a very early stage of development called trust versus mistrust
and if we haven't had that conflict resolved at a very early age we will have to work on that conflict
later um so so one of my jobs would be that if somebody comes in and they're just not trusting
i have to work on the level of trust and i've got to get their animal to trust my animal
and that doesn't happen because i say nice things or i know a lot of stuff it happens on a deep
unconscious animalistic primitive nature and if i have somebody in my
now now and this is one of the things i mean you and i've talked about this before like
i don't operate under what let's say cognitive behavioral therapy has an approach called flooding
flooding is what you do somebody's got a spider phobia for example they come in my
office and i just have 10 spiders i just release in the room and i lock the door
and they just got to deal with it and that can be effective it can also traumatize
um so we have to be very careful right so i i'm trying to assess what level of intervention
is is is valuable and the first level of intervention in my modern approach by far is trust
if if i don't have somebody that and here's a fundamental like spiritual word i hear a lot
of times surrender there's no way you can surrender to this process if you don't have
somebody walking with you or it's difficult i can say it's very would be it would be incredibly
difficult for somebody to surrender to the process without having somebody to look toward and say
am i safe because egos inherently seek orientation and they can go a lot of places
if they at least know okay like i don't feel good this is not okay my body mind heart and
spirit is telling me i'm gonna die and then i should trust nobody right now
but i've surrendered to this and i can at least trust this person then i go through it like when
you work with trauma when you work with grief think about that like if you're grieving somebody
one of the things you most want is that person back right whether it's a relationship whether
it's a death whether it's a breakup or a death you want that person back and your your whole
existence is going to be trying to create that opportunity for them to be back and you have
to trust that what you're actually doing is saying goodbye and when you've loved and connected really
deeply with somebody and you have to say goodbye to them on this plane of existence when you're
even struggling with your own existence in this plane of existence that is a scary thing to say
the least so to trust is important in that space so i i mean i yeah go on let me let me
interrupt i'm sorry john rob what where does that sit with you what john just said yeah it's it's
it's right here you you've got to develop that trust instinctively first it's got it's got to
be the first thing i mean oh if we're talking from a initiation perspective then i've really
got to trust the person who's initiating me you're not going to get that far without without that
trust you've got to develop that trust and maybe i mean to a certain extent the doctor aspect plays
apart because you've got to see it and um you value a doctor more than you would do a plumber
you know if you've got a plumber initiating you then you wouldn't be so easy you you wouldn't
take the information on but if you if you've got a doctor john price talking to you then that that
makes a difference it's like it's a it's a certain level of it's not all authority but it's you know
john's had to go through quite a lot of education to get that title so you apply a certain
certain amount of it waits wait to your trust in him well i know that is he's very good at what
he does and his own field recognizing we have to give him his kudos would you would you let john
um john's talked about um trauma and i would say if we found out if we find out rob that trauma
can heal would you let john um starve you strip you naked and beat you probably not to be honest
no not and and quite frankly rob nor would i ever do that yeah yeah but if but but here's the kicker
though um and because here's where your language steps in and the way that i like to interpret some
of this i i i do for example want to starve you of previous behavioral and thought patterns that
used to serve you that we're learning very quickly are no longer serving you i would like to remind
you consistently when you go off of your path you know to maybe not to beat you to maybe i body
check you in a symbolic way that says hey you know i notice that you're going down this direction
let's talk about that what that means you know that to be naked most definitely but not literally
