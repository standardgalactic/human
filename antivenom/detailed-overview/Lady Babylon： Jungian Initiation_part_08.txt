and these are the prescribed antidote to your problem is being whipped naked with an olive branch
or a Laurel branch which is just part of the initiation then you you'd go further into that
is that what you're referring to England when you when you when you're saying I'm stood there naked
and I'm being whipped with a Laurel but with branch or yeah I'm I'm talking about Villa the mysteries
brother I'm talking about that yeah I'm talking about somebody really getting it and Dionysus
being present I'm talking about the real cult that cult that reaches in and grabs the individual and
you would be comfortable this is interesting I find this fascinating thank you both for your time
I find it fascinating you you would let John strip you down and beat you at this point because you
trust him because you trust him right and I'm wondering if in that process John we can't do that
now right we can't John can't reach through the we can't replicate the circumstances but John right
now could hit upon John it's a kind of just quite it's very important point really that you you would
travel to the to the sanctuary you would travel there so when you would go in you would you I
don't know what you'd want somebody who you could who'd have a John's got a trustworthy face you could
say you're handing yourself over you're handing yourself over and you're withdrawing and you kind
of put yourself into John's hands because you want to receive some therapy that's that's the reason
why you're going and that's what you want to get out of it and the way John's going about it right
now is certainly yeah if we we wouldn't do it in this day and age but they were the practices in
that day and age so though those practices you wouldn't really expect any different we really
we've learned a lot but there's also a lot what we've lost within it we don't know really what is
inside or what why why they come up with these ideas for initiation why the whipping with the
branch why are you naked why you've got go into wondering why them situations are there do you
all serve a purpose each aspect of the initiation must serve a purpose otherwise you it'd be waste
and you'd you'd rid yourself of that waste while you're going through the process of
trying to help somebody with with certain type of therapy these days we we've got a completely
different way of going about it and that's we didn't always have did we you look at the early
psychology tests what they would have what they've done on human beings and
they've quit quite aggressive you know they have they have locked a gale in a room for years of a
life to only being fed food through a through a hole in the wall just to observe the lack of
socialization just to observe that that that was the whole this whole purpose of the experiment
was to see what results they got from that experiment so you know we're not that far out of this
I totally agree with that with whipping whipping people and the electrocuting people and we're
not that far out of it and we're on the cusp really of discovering that there is something more
and we're also discovering that that they knew more in the ancient times about aspects what we
what we are blinded in a certain respect so you'd say Rob you're a fan of
John's John's fortunate position of being at this kind of renaissance where where
he can rediscover those ancient techniques those that ancient physics we were talking
about before you came the quantum that you know they're saying now there's some sort of connection
between quantum physics and the human brain you know of course you know it's just the human
the brain in general um so yeah um yeah could you say something about that in the world that
we're living in in this apocalypse that I called it before you you you identify John as the healer
you can you can feel that you know that um would you be comfortable with physicians going back to
that knowledge and bringing that forward I mean you've you've read everything in the world nobody
can put anything past you Rob I know that and if if you're on a board of masons you're the leader
I know that for a fact so um for someone with such high standards and somebody who knows let's
face it you know honestly you've you've learned a little hypnosis you know a little bit of that um
tell me about embracing John's renaissance movement toward away from this away toward this
healing toward this healing that we could we could send the fascists and the evangelicals
some sort of assistance rather than turning this American experience into a giant civil war
yeah so you don't want the apocalypse or the giant civil war it's it's not easy to
to view these things and hear these things and actually have a conversation about these things
it's not it's not a pleasant situation um you do hear a lot quite a lot coming out of America now
from from this side of the pond and it's um it's troubling it really is troubling and I I really
haven't got the experience or knowledge base about evangelicals or even
any sort of right wing kind of entity because it's it's not something that's study it's not
something I've I choose to study that you know you've only got so much study time to study so
I'm going to dedicate that to something I enjoy studying rather than something I don't enjoy
I don't enjoy what I have had to give me time to it just of late and um it is worrying that
there's an a group of people that need treating by John's methods that for need the treatment
by John's method says volumes to me because John's methods aren't I can't really say as I'm
I watch John's podcast and and I and I really respect what John's work and these the
