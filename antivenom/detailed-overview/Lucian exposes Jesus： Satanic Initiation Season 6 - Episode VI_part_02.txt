What happened?
Um, his eyes, I just want to fast forward his eyes.
Oh God, you can't look at his eyes.
They're Gorgon, man.
They're full of the life.
Not only are they that, they're Intheon.
They're Intheon people.
Look at the third.
My Greek students, third to last line from the bottom.
Look at the first word.
Intheon.
Do you see what's happening?
Right.
This, these are the kind of eyes that we want.
Right.
Give me the next text.
Here we go.
This is gorgeous.
Blow this one up.
People.
I'm sorry if this gets out of hand.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
So thank you, Lucian.
Your testimony is that Alexander was exceptionally handsome and had an amazing look to him.
Yeah.
And what, what'd you say about his voice?
Hades day.
Oh, I think that's a good one.
Oh, that's right.
He had the sweetest voice, a voice that couldn't chant you.
Okay.
This kid has the charisma.
We're not talking about an adult.
We're talking about somebody who is not yet through puberty.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
You mean we're starting here with a description of the lace days?
Of course we are.
Who do you think is trafficking?
I'm, I'm about to show you this lace days.
Alexander trafficking children, specifically young boys.
Okay.
Let's go to bring that text up again.
Yeah.
There we go.
Okay.
Can we get the other way?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So look, when he was, you know, when he was a miracle, when he was a miracle, when he
was a little kid, when he wasn't yet quite to the point of his complete bloom, Orion,
he was coming into season.
Put yourself in the great shoes.
That's how they're thinking about it.
When he was that young lad, they will translate it.
The Brits will translate it back from 1850.
He was a young lad.
Ah, without the beard.
A young lad.
So the text.
And what happens?
Just jump down to the third line.
Everybody in Greek knows what is that?
That means he was prostituting.
Um, he was engaging in sexual activity.
Um, that's the proper translation.
He was engaging in sexual activity before being through puberty.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
We're talking about the laystace and the company that is kept by the laystace.
And we're going to start with the apostle.
This Alexander is the apostle.
Are you ready?
So, um, he pornated himself.
He went out and look on the next line.
Kind of soon name.
Yeah.
He entered into intercourse for cash for an exchange.
Right.
And he did so with anybody who had the urge.
Anybody who had the urge.
Okay.
Um, he's very smart.
Alexander was very smart.
Very smart.
And he figured out at a young age, he knew what was going to pay the bills.
He knew how to make it.
And he was going to use his good looks to get there.
He's going to use his good looks.
Right.
Fortunately, Lucian says that wore off that wore off and that charm.
So when it did, he entered into other aspects of being a laystace, being an
apprentice and then graduating up to the one who took over the practice.
Are you ready for this?
You're going to love this people.
We get serpents in here in just a minute here.
We got to bust through these.
Let's bring that same one up.
Yep.
Okay.
And so he's fornating himself, people.
And I just want to say, what are the real points here?
Yeah.
And so, um, one of the people that he was having as a client, a paid client,
happened to be go as happened to be a magician.
One of his lovers happened to be a magician.
And this guy was committed to the practice of magic and epodes and
crystals and little gifty gifts done in the act of love.
Okay.
