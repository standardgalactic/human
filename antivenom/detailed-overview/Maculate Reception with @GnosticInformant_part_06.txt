That's what a Stoic is.
A Stoic is able to, anything's thrown at you,
you can handle like, a lot of opium will make you a Stoic.
Exactly, that's a cheat code for being a Stoic
is being on opium.
Yeah, they ran opium to Spartans once
in order to, because they were all using it,
you know what I mean?
Oh, they were fighting battle.
So there are wounds and stuff like that.
Yeah, if you have an endless supply of opium,
you can be the best Stoic in the world all day.
And remember, this is opium that's not been
acetylated into heroin, right?
So it's gonna be a, right?
It's gonna be a different, this is not an opium den.
Marcus Aurelia is sitting on his side
and dreaming all the time.
No, no, no, he's using it in a way
to capacitate himself rather than to oblige himself.
To understand what it takes to be a Stoic,
you have to understand that the mind of Zeus,
that's the Logos, is in control.
And whatever that Logos' will is, is what's gonna happen.
And you don't have any control over it.
So you have to accept it and play your role,
whether you're a slave or you're a plebian
or you're a equestrian, a warrior or a farmer or a king,
you play your role that you were granted
by the mind of Zeus.
You do it without complaining.
That is what a Stoic is.
Doesn't it sound like an opium thing?
Sounds like, if you have opium,
you're gonna be a great Stoic.
You're gonna feel good.
Yeah, I love it.
I love it.
Now look at the last sentence.
Just because a text is ancient does not mean
it isn't a forgery or it's content,
isn't salacious fiction.
Now, wait a minute.
I'm, we're talking, do you see how ridiculous this is?
This dude steps up into the ring
and I'm gonna take away his sword
and I'm gonna shove it somewhere, right?
I'm, dude, who is this?
Jeremy, dude, let me just tell you something.
We were talking about Galen
and he is writing about prescriptions
for Marcus Aurelius, noting that he has to adjust
the dosage of opium upwards
because Marcus Aurelius is becoming accustomed,
is how they express it, accustomed to the drug, right?
This is not salacious fiction.
This can't be salacious fiction.
I'm talking science.
I'm talking science, Jeremy.
Wake up and have your cherry popped.
Wow, that's amazing.
Get out of here.
Pull that kid's corpse out of here.
Give me the next one.
Oh God, Amon should write a book someday.
Somebody's just telling me
I should translate the Bible.
Again, Christian for many decades.
Oh, this is somebody who's been there
and who's been in it.
I love these types of responses
because look, there's a psychology out there
of people who have been pulled into
the Christian machine, right?
Or the monist machine, the Jewish Orthodox machine,
the Christian machine, the Islamic fundamentalist machine,
the Taliban machine, all of the monism, right?
Those sucked them in and you can get out.
You can escape.
You can take your burqa off and you can run around, right?
I love that.
I love that.
When people write to me and say that,
that is the sure soul suck.
That is the, oh, you know you've communed with someone.
You know what that is?
That's that eodomania right there.
That's that stoic virtue of having that eodomania.
The breaks up into good daemon,
but really mean happiness.
Yeah, oh, God.
That's what I see in that comment right there.
There's a stoic right there.
Speaking of stoicism, I mean, I was talking about the topic.
That's a sexy way to talk.
I love that, Neil.
Give me the next one.
Kindly, but realistically and energetically,
the video, oh, this video is a portal.
This man is a portal.
And are you sure you want to spread this energy, Danny?
Danny, what does your God say?
Please follow it.
Oh, you can see this, this nightingale, oh, God.
This is who is this?
This is Impress.
This is Impress Oracle.
Danny, Impress Oracle wants to save you.
She wants to save you, Danny.
Can you believe the psychology of portal?
What, okay, let's just assume she's right.
What kind of portal, what does she mean?
Like, is that why my bathroom stinks sometimes?
Or, you know, is that why I can't explain
what the droppings are in the backyard?
Do some portal open up?
Some, you know, some sewage just flood in or something?
What the, seriously?
How am I supposed to take this, Neil?
Well, in a way, she's right.
You kind of are bringing a portal to the ancient world.
You're saying, look, here's the ancient world.
We forgot about it.
Through the dark ages, we lost this information.
What I'm here to enlighten everybody.
And so, yeah, it is a portal.
We're opening up a portal to ancient Athens
and ancient Eleusis and Rome and Alexandria.
So, yeah, it is a portal.
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely, I want to go back to that mystery
that Jesus was involved in.
That's what I want.
I just want to lay in there and get somebody
that I want, I want to see that naked kid
standing there with Jesus and be like,
just for one minute, have the insight to say.
What if you couldn't bring your phone though?
So no one would believe you.
That would start.
Or if you just have one snapshot, you have to get it.
What are you going to do?
Right?
Or maybe you drop your phone or something.
You leave it there or something, right?
I don't know.
I saw it, everybody, and they're like,
where's the effort?
Like, shit.
Oh man, I guess I'm demon possessed again.
Hit it.
Go ahead.
Hit the clip.
Next one.
And then there was the inquiry, the formal inquiry.
And it was two, I'm told it was two charges.
Number one was demon possession,
which personally, I think that's pretty cool.
That's pretty, that's pretty metal.
No, it is.
Yeah.
Number two, it was, I was opening portals.
To where?
I don't know.
But do you think I would be a Catholic?
Can you find this?
Is this published anywhere?
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, it could be.
Stevie, I find it.
I got to finish though so people can have
a little sympathy for me.
I was fired after the production of the Medea.
It was wildly successful.
People said it was the best thing
they've ever produced, right?
But I had Furie's choruses of Catholic
university students pointing, I was,
What?
Yes.
They said they wanted it accurate.
So, two things, people talk about,
they don't like that there was so much censoring, right?
They don't like that Danny had to bleep it,
you know what I mean?
So, that's interesting, right?
There's a group of people out there
who are sensitive to that free.
In Danny's defense, he wasn't trying
to censor you because he wanted to.
He just wanted to make sure that the video
didn't get brought down by the YouTube algorithm.
Anything, he freed you up in a certain way.
Yeah, no, no, no, that's exactly what I thought.
He did that, he has to dance that dance,
or he's not gonna get on and I.
The video would not be as many views as it has
if he would have, if he just would have
dropped the way it was.
No.
It would have flagged so bad.
Yeah, no, no, totally, totally reasonable,
totally reasonable, not reasonable.
And in his defense as well, you have the option
if you wanna go and get the full gritty version,
it's out there, you know?
Yeah, yeah, if you want the full dirty movie,
go buy it, right?
Go buy it, yeah, yeah.
And for those of you who don't have the money,
look, I'm poor.
For those of you who don't have the money to do that,
look at what I'm saying, you can see what I'm saying.
You don't need it.
You don't need it, yeah.
I mean, they left it available enough
that we can figure out what it means.
Right.
You know what I mean?
So I thought it was great that he laughed
in the background.
Steve, I don't know if you caught it,
but you can hear Steve laugh in the background
over the demon possession thing.
But I want you to see that this is happening again.
And again, this is part of the initiation.
There is a static that you will rub up against.
And that static produces this demon possession thing.
Right, so it's pretty cool.
I think it is metal, to be honest.
Give me the last clip, sweetie.
Yeah, nobody is above, nobody is above the democracy.
