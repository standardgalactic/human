because he's got some exposure
to that literary culture of the Greeks.
And that's why people,
people say that they found pots
and there's Greek and Hebrew.
That's why you know those are Hebrew.
You know what's circulating?
Greek.
Greek is the literary language.
Hebrew is not, right?
It's not.
It's not built for it.
It's not capacitated for it.
Greek is, but don't worry.
The Roman scientific stuff, blue.
It totally blue.
I know people love Lucretius
and they're like, oh, the nature of things.
That blows compared to Aristotle.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I say what I think,
but give me the last couple of quotes
and I want Neil.
There were a couple of funny ones here.
Just give, give me it.
Oh, WTF.
What bro did he just say?
Jesus touched little boys
and was sipping on the venom.
I kind of feel weird if I write his name.
I just yelled at my laptop 500 times
because he's convincing.
Okay.
That guy's possessed, dude.
Dude, whatever you're taking.
Okay.
Fantastic.
They said I was taking something.
What are you talking about?
You guys in the audience, you're taking things.
Go give me that one.
This guy definitely works with the gin.
What did you think about that?
Well, I guess if you want to talk about
the Arabic translation of demon,
I guess gin is the word you go with, right?
Yeah.
I like the fact that it's the idea
that you can manipulate.
Like the, the gin is there, you know,
and there's certain things, agreements
that can be made, etc.
I don't know.
I kind of like that.
That's where you get the genie from, right?
Genie.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Exactly.
I want, I want a bottle.
Give me the next one.
Too weird.
Oh, by the way,
we're on the topic of genies.
There's an Arabic text from the,
I don't know, 700 or something like that.
Maybe 800s.
And it talks about an ancient ruin.
And they, in this ancient ruin,
they found all types of genie bottles
and gold and diamonds and jewels.
And then they find a text and it says,
written in old Ionian characters.
That's what, that's how they describe it.
Old Ionian character.
And it's Psalms.
Not Hebrew.
It's the book of Psalms.
And it's written in old Ionian character, Greek.
Isn't that crazy?
No, it's not crazy.
Cause Psalm is a Greek word.
It is.
It's not crazy at all.
It's exactly what David does.
Oh, it's not crazy.
It's exactly what Orpheus does.
He plays a Samoan.
Yeah.
And Museus and Moses.
It's a song meant for a harp.
That's what it means.
Yes.
Exactly.
Did you know that song, you know,
Moses as Museus is a songwriter, right?
So that's why you get people asked sometimes,
why do you have songs of Moses?
Right?
Because when Moses' character was invented,
they were doing it based off the Greek Museus.
Who was a poet?
That's why, that's why so many,
that's why a lot of scholars and myself included
say that the nature of early Judaism,
whatever you want to call it,
Septuagint Judaism, is Orphic by nature.
Cause it's all, it's being performed as songs.
You get the Psalms.
You get the Proverbs.
You get all these.
And it's all written in a cadence.
It's like, that's what,
that's how the Orphic texts were written.
And by the way,
the Orphic texts were called Apocalypses.
We're called Revelations.
Correct.
Orpheus was called the Theologian.
All the same technology,
all the same technological words that you get
in Judeo-Christianity,
you find in Alexandria in the Orphic for literature.
Yeah.
Why don't people listen to that, Neil?
Why don't people listen to you say?
Some of them do, some of them do.
Some of them do.
James Charles,
James Charles was a big,
big time Bible scholar.
He's written about this subject.
So it's out there.
It's just not like,
you just, it's just not fully absorbed yet.
It's just starting to get out there,
which is a good thing though.
Yeah.
I think if we look at the underbelly
and we bring out all the underbelly,
I think people will start.
Like I want people to investigate
why Peter, James, and John
can get away with killing Anna Nysa and Sapphira.
And you say, well, wait a minute.
No, the Lord smote them.
Okay.
Find that works on your fairytale level,
but antiquity was real history, right?
So I want to know how the hell they got away with that.
I understand they convinced their own followers
that Anna Nysa and Sapphira would be in greedy
and keeping gold out of their pockets.
So God smote them.
I understand your acolyte,
who is a monist,
your monist acolyte can be trained to believe anything.
All right.
So I understand them,
but the people around them weren't the,
weren't the pagans standing around?
Weren't they like, Jesus, did you see those,
those Christians killed some of their own people?
Right?
You know, don't we get the authorities involved?
It makes me wonder, were some of those crucifixions,
well, some of that stuff, I'll bet you, was legitimate.
You know what I mean?
Like Peter may have gotten what he deserved.
If you don't follow the fairytale,
if you follow the reality,
it is Peter, James, and John killing two people
to make a lesson to the acolytes who were nuts
that if they don't do something,
they're going to end up like that, glory be to God.
And we stand around and we look at that.
It's just like Jesus with his young disciples,
with his young boys.
We look at that and we don't,
it doesn't penetrate our brain.
We see the fairytale that the,
that Christianity is very carefully,
is very carefully plastered over.
And oh, I love it.
The chance to be able to get to tell people this
is our privilege and our honor, Neil.
And it's a privilege and honor to have your fellow
warriorship and working with you.
And tell us real quick about what you're going to be doing
over the next, because I want to hear your art,
like give us a glimpse into the studio.
The next video I'm coming out with is a,
it's kind of an anthropology video,
having to do with the, what is religion,
the history of religion going back,
I'm quoting from Petrarch and Brumi and Machiavelli,
what they thought about at their time period
when they were starting to wake up from
what seems like some sort of hypnosis
that came over the West for 800 years
at that point in time, plethon.
And I'm going through the, you know,
the etymology of the word religio in Latin,
and then in Greek, eosebia, you know,
and there's always different words with theosabes,
there's pietas, there's fedes,
all these different words that we would consider to be
where we get our word religion from.
And it's the, it's the oath that you take.
It's the awe of the frenzy.
It's the devotion to the gods, obviously.
And it's the, it's the community of like elusis, for example.
So there's a lot of different factors,
not just one thing.
It's not just I go to a church,
religion is Christianity or Judaism.
That's a way dumbed down, fixed way to look at religion.
Whereas religion is more about the cult,
the culture, where we get the word culture from.
And that's what I'm getting into.
It's very anthropological.
It's going through a lot of history,
but it also is going to shake things up
because I'm calling some people out,
some of these modern day religious scholars
that are full of shit.
You'll see.
Dan McClellan's one of them.
I didn't watch you say that, but I just, I just slipped.
Sorry.
