We don't care, do we? No
We are here because we want to get to the real
We want to get to the bottom
We don't care about what theories are
And I want to reemphasize that this season
We don't care what your theories are
We don't care what books you write
We don't care what classes you teach
We don't care what you're selling
We're here to find out what that crystal clear reality tastes like
Yeah, we're here for that spring
You guys are all devotees of the muse
We don't care that Harvard and Yale have dropped the ball
And Princeton has shot its own brains out
We don't care that they academically committed suicide
We don't care that Harvard and Yale and every other ivory tower association on the planet
Is scrambling to figure out where they went wrong
We don't care
Ours is the evidence, this is the museum
We have the sources, we have the texts
Let's jump into one tonight
This is our first, I just want to give you the first Greek text that I've got up here
Yes, beautiful, thank you, Chewie
Yeah, I'm just going to give you a little bit of diascordies
A little bit of diascordies
And this time I'm going to do it a little bit differently
I'm going to let you see the text, I'm going to flash it up here
And I'm going to tell you that we're going to be looking at Mandrake
We're going to be looking at Mandrake
And then I want to put the, go ahead and take the text down
And now I'm going to read it to you
For those of you who do such things, you pause it there
And you can go back over the Greek
But for those of you who say, I'm not into the Greek
But I want to hear what this has to say
For you, we'll take that down
I want to read to you about Mandrake
We call this planet, he says, the Cersean
The Cersean
And when he says that right away, we all run
To the folks at the university and we tell them
This is a compound, a polythonic compound
That is called by the name
That you can then piece together all of its component parts
To restore it, to make it one
It's the Cersean
The Cersean, okay, what is this Cersean thing?
This is what they're looking for in Spain
It's what they've got in their hair
It's what they've got in their hair
Okay, so let's look at one of the constituents of the Cersean compound
It is this Mandrake, the root of Mandrake
And when I say Cersean, I want you to remember
I want you to remember that we are talking about
Late Bronze Age monarchies
That are ruled by women who have extra-specialized knowledge
That knowledge is being used militarily
It's being used medicinally
And it is being used in a very destructive way
As well as a very positive way too
You could say it was their artificial intelligence
It was that burst, that fluorescence
There are people who are known to be the pioneers of these fields
You might be surprised to find out
But Pythagoras calls this combination
His oracular prophet
Give me some prophet
I need the prophet
Strangely enough, this prophet is a mantic prophet
And this prophet gives you the future
Through insanity, through lunacy, through mania
Now here's the thing, for those of you who need it
This drug can cure that violent, wrathful, fierce impulse
Yes, fantastic, that's how it's being used medically
That's how the doctors are apparently very good
Stabilize your brain
Yes, they're inducing a state
Let's see what else he says about this drug
You're going to be surprised
This is one of the Cercian elements
What do we know about this Cercian element?
Well, we know the Egyptians call it blah blah blah
We've got all these different regions
But Pythagoras calls the mandrake this
This little anthropomorph
Isn't that nice?
Throw up, give the mandrake up there
Let people see the creepy root
And notice that this old drug, this old drug
Even the Zoroastrians, he says
Call it this original or prime communion
This prime communion, the Romans have their names for it, right?
And some people call it the penis of Typhon
We know that the people that are involved have these baskets
Yes, these baskets with these dildos
And it only makes sense that this medicated dildo that we're using
To administer this drug
Remember guys, you're not in Kansas anymore
I forgot to tell you the ship, we're already there
