You've got to realize that this is coming from the worship of the great mother
Who is actively involved in the sexual maturation
Of what you and I would call a child
Yes, so already we're in a foreign world
We're in a foreign world, we're going to have to get up
Sniff that air and we're going to say
Okay, this isn't what I want, right?
This isn't what I want, it's culturally this is
But it's there, so we're going to have to deal with it
We're going to have to see the right as it was in the real
Yes, good
So Pythagoras is steeped in the use of this
Mania-inducing drug, and remember it is only the
It is only the menads who end up bringing
You say what? Yeah, it turns out if you take this drug
It turns out if you take this drug
Diascortis tells you that it can put you into a place of
Where you're off onus
Yes, and what does that mean?
It means literally without a voice
It means literally without a voice
But it is word used of the tragic chorus
It is a dropping, a roughening, a harshening of the voice
Chemically, chemically
In other words, we're inducing a mania, a psychosis
We'll show you the drugs in a minute
But you're inducing a psychosis with these things
That involves a visionary state that is complete horror
And you say, why would you want to do that?
And they say, well, in antiquity the doctors say
Well, it helps with the aggression problem
Yeah, it helps with the aggression problem
You put somebody through this initiation
And you bring them out securely
It's part of their health
They didn't say mental health
But it's a way of casting out the demons
Fantastic, you can see the health is there
So here we are with the mandrake
And he says it's very useful
It's very useful, the root and its juice are very useful
In the filtron
I think I've got the Greek
Let's just go through some of these forms of the Greek up here
We'll start up here
This is the type of power that you're dealing with
The karotikos, isn't that nice?
The stupefying
And the karotikoi are a whole group of powers
Of drugs
Let's go to the next one
Whenever we're dealing with cereals
We've got to get into the cetaneus
Remember, take it down all of these drugs
And this is hard for us to understand
But they're using not one drug at a time
They're using compounds against other compounds
So multiple component drugs
That are the dote
And the antidote or the antifarmicon
Being these mixtures that are used to buffer
To maximize the potential
Without killing the patient
So they're under the influence of a lot of drugs
And you know they tweak it
With the more opium here
Have you seen how much thyscortis has on opium?
The surgeons are using mandrake
If they want to put you to sleep
To take something out of you
Or to cauterize, he says
They have to put you under the influence of the mandrake
It can knock you out for two to three hours
And their hours are like two and a half hours
And that's why he says the surgeons use them
The surgeons use them, right?
Good, good, good
But we have these states
What if we are missing?
What if we are missing something here?
And that we have failed
In our struggle for mental health
We failed to cast out our demons
Because we dropped the ball
We dropped the ball
We let the compounds
The knowledge of those compounds go
We let them go
And now we've got nothing on the receiving end
We know that these chemicals work in the brain
We know they do certain things
We know that when you enter death
The brain acts differently
Yes, yes, now
What do we know about inducing this state
In an individual
Through a polypharmaceutical process, right?
The only way we're going to get there is through the mandrake
It's through the actual evidence
