Through the actual drugs that are used
This is fantastic
This is fantastic
The juice makes a filter
And what is a fieldtron?
I've got another
Just keep bringing me up to the Greek
Maybe it's one of these
There we go
Just click away at you
Is this the fieldtron?
Yes, it is
Look at here, people
Look at what we've got
Isn't this gorgeous?
Look at this fieldtron
You know what you use these things for?
You use these things to bring yourself to the moment
To the moment that you're able to understand
The past and the future
All at the present, right?
This is temple of Aphrodite stuff
Temple of Aphrodite stuff
And I just want you to notice that it can
Just mean the thing that causes love and affection
That thing that brings you there
So remember, when we're talking antiquity
We're talking the sexiness of the science
Is off the chart
All of it is complaining about
Oh man, I've been taking so many out for DZX
I can't get an erection anymore
What am I going to do for that?
So in order to exist in this society
Where they're using all of these drugs
In a very sophisticated way
You've got to have a college of priestesses
Please, those of you at the Bronze Age
To realize the level that we're working with here
It's just phenomenal, it's off the charts
The education here is off the charts
It's wonderful
I just want to make one quick note
From the text, right?
You'll get a lot of talk about
Well, you take so much
And you take even more, double that
And this kind of group of symptoms you'll get
You won't just get the mania, the psychosis
That's stage one, by the way
For all of you who are keeping track
With our drug cocktails
Yes, we're at stage one here, the mania
So you have to keep it at a certain level
You don't go off the edge
And thank goodness, there's guys like Nacandu
Who say, look, here's the antidotes
For when you catch these people out
And they're off the edge
And all they can do is make animal noises
Remember, where are we?
We're at the Late Bronze Age
If you're not careful, Cersei, Queen of the Etruscans
Is going to cut off your gonads
And give you drugs, anally, with a wand
And put you into a cage
Turn you into that eunuch servant, right?
Oh, God, turn you into that pig
Where do you think the Sibyls are coming from
In the Bronze Age?
Where do you think that tradition is coming from?
Sibyl is a Traskin word, man
That C is the word for gods
I didn't get that from anywhere
I got that from John Littis
You want to look up?
Oh, look up John Littis
See what he says about Sibyls
Love it, love it, I love this stuff
So here we are, we still got the Mandrake
And I still want you to see where are we doing
We're going into, oh, we're going into that manic
We're going into that manic stage
Okay, so what is the delirium
That is so beneficial medicinally
That we are bringing, right?
What is that?
Because that's the state that we want to get to
And we're only going to get there
With the proper balance of drugs
And the right sexual act
That's going to get us, somebody asked me
What's the purpose of all of the
Use of this drug, right?
That these guys like Pythagoras
And these oracles are flipping out on
What's the use of this kind of thing?
Is it just vision?
Is it just insight?
