And I would have to say, I would have to say
You and I are sitting in a history of oracles
It doesn't matter what countries you're from
It doesn't matter what your peoples are
What your ethnicities are
It doesn't matter what your language is
We're still sitting within a history
That is a struggle for the mystery itself
For the performance of the mystery
To bring back that couple of Lady Babylon
Is the greatest danger to the Christian religion
Is the greatest danger to the followers of Moses
I'm not talking those Israelis
That are partying in the disco, right?
Who talk about the dotes
I'm not talking about those people
I'm talking about the Orthodox
I'm talking about the fundamentalists, right?
This greatest threat to their system
Is the control of the mystery
Is the control of the mystery
And what was this mystery that was operating
In the ancient world
What was the purpose?
Out of it, every time
Out of it comes the oracular capacity
To read the future and the past in the present
Now hang on a second
Before you jump and you're like
Oh, it's fortune telling, right?
It is fortune telling
But it's fortune telling on a scientific level
It's fortune telling via chemistry
And via music
Yeah, it's an accelerated form of learning
It's the Pythagorean root
It's the reason he's in the cave
Yes, it's a development
It's a development
Before Jesus and Mary ever got together
He had to cast seven demons out of her
Right?
So these states of mania that are associated with the soter
Right?
Were originally states of mania associated with the soter
With the soter
Yeah, throw me up these last
I need the devil said hurry up
Tonight we're going to have seven
At half past we're going to have an old boy
Who's going to bring us some new info from Britain
He's been running back in time for us
Go ahead and bring up which of these have we not seen
There we go
Yeah, I just want you to see here
Strich Struchnon
Right?
And look at three and four Struchnon monicon
And Struchnon hypnoticon
So you have very different, you know
The effects here mentally and diascortes
We'll mention these
So you have the regular sleep
And then you have the manic state
Right?
And some of the plants are better
Introducing that maniac state
That good mania
Right?
Okay, let's get another one
I just want you to see the whole school
To be mad from taking hembain
Right?
So when you're tripping
When you're tripping on this stuff
And you've got the purple stain
And they know you're one of those, right?
They'll probably call you the profaitin
They'll probably call you the galloid
Right?
You've got different names for them
These followers of Kotito
Don't you like that one?
Oh, that's a good one
This is what you've got on board
This is what you're doing
This is what you're doing to enter
Go ahead and put up Ezekius
I want people to see Ezekius
Look here, you know
This is to be crazy
Mania, apotis pos
From the communion drink, right?
From the potion itself, right?
There's a heart to the mandrake
Oh, Eve is always...
She's always right there, pertinent
There's a heart to the mandrake
And Diascorti says
