You can give somebody that heart, that fruit
Right?
You can give somebody that fruit
And that fruit is the thing that opens the eyes
That fruit is the heightened awareness
Yeah, it is that thing which got us all kicked out of the garden
Yeah, right?
Now we have to have that painful childbirth
Don't be fooled
This all goes back to the childbirth
If you don't have a fetus somehow involved here
You're in the wrong place
If you aren't considering, seriously considering
Drinking fetal juice
Then you don't drink the blood and eat the flesh
Yes, you don't drink the blood and eat the flesh
With the mandrake, with the mandrake
We can follow, we can say, okay
We've got another group
Another group of drugs that are what...
I'm calling constellations
That's my own, I'm just trying to characterize what's going on
But we've got another constellation of drugs
That has a very specific role that you can see driven
Throughout the history from the earliest recorded Greek that we've got
From the earliest recorded Greek
When all we've got's the wanasa
All we've got's the wanasa
We have those drugs from the very beginning
And we have these women
And I just, I really wanted to stress
We are starting to see, because the Bronze Age archeology is flourishing right now
We're beginning to see different kind of society
That is this poison arrow horse culture
And we see that there are, surprise, surprise
There are women who are the generals
You know, the Chinese didn't like this in the Bronze Age
They had a very male driven and looked down upon female power
Yeah, because their problem was with those guys who were riding around
Whose women are the generals
Yeah, and who were fighting out in the front
Yeah, and their mobile horse troops
Yeah, the Greeks had to deal with these people too
Right, these were the amadzone
Or these were the masakitai
Yeah, these were the people who were there
These are the people who were there to use that poison in the arrow
So, mandrake tonight
Mandrake, we've got to root ourselves in the physical nature of what they were doing
Tonight's mandrake shows us that we can have families of drugs
That are meant to achieve certain effects in health
Certain effects in colt
We can have those families of drugs
And our last surprise tonight
We are looking for those of you who are interested in the more esoteric
I know a lot of people out there are talking about esoteric
But if you really want the esoteric
You want to know what rights were used by the Caesar's
You want to know what rights were the ruler's rights
And you want to follow those
Which we can
I can tell you what Augustus Caesar did in the privacy of his own bedroom
I can tell you that
I can tell you that why
Because that drug has left a fingerprint
And when I say drug, please people, please understand
I do not mean a single drug
I do not mean one thing
Please bring up those tropane alkaloids
Look at this, these are the drugs we're talking about people
Look at this, from our plants here, our family
Here's our mandrake
Here's our belladonna
Here's our detour
And look at the chemicals that we're getting
These all have that tropane ring
With that one nitrogen
Oh, this is gorgeous
And these...
Wait, cocaine?
Rights, rights
Now you're starting to get the Bacchic frenzy
This is not the place for the hippies
Right, hippies should not
Hippies don't, don't show up
Don't show up, don't show up singing songs
Don't
If you're going to
Participate in these rights
You're going to have to enter the darkness
You're going to have to enter that mania
You're going to have to worship
Malinawe
The goddess of black mania
Dark black
Putrid mania
These are the gods of death, man
This is Lhasa, stepping forward
This is the one who's going to smash your pumpkin with her
