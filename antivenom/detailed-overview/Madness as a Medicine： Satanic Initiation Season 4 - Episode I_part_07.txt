So there's a few kind of areas that link from Maeve
So you have a goddess kind of aspect
You also have a sovereignty aspect
And you also just have the...
There's like a ruler and a healer
And all of the meetings that take place
The large meetings, they always occur in the mead hall as well
So that's kind of like her space
If she's the mead woman
Which is what they believe her name means
So this is where all the meetings take place in the mead hall
And with regards to the magic
There's definitely inclinations to that in the text
Especially as you have one...
There's one text which actually mentions that
Cuckullen's chariot rider
He actually, it says, has a mantle made of ravens feathers
Which was given to him by Simon Magus
And then there's these other kind of sections where...
Cuckullen, he's kind of like a hero figure
And he basically swatters everybody that he comes across
But he goes into these frenzes, these rages
And it often mentions this kind of...
An underlying meaning to the text you can tell
For example, if I find one
So one of the four tellings regarding Cuckullen
This is what it says
Fair of deeds, the man I see
Wounded sore is his fair skin
On his brow shines the hero's light
Victory's seat is in his face
Seven gems of champions brave
Deck the centre of his orbs, his eyes
Naked are the spears he bears
And he hooks a red cloak around
Noblest face is he I see
He respects all womankind
Young the lad and fresh his hue
With a dragon's form in fight
So that's just an example of how he's described
And there are actually a couple of sooths
So in the Feast of Breekrieu
You have three champions
And they're basically...
They're all in a competition to see who's the greatest champion
And it kind of escalates as the story goes along
And eventually they decide to go to Mavenaliel's castle
To see who can prove themselves to be worthy
Of the champion's portion
Which is kind of like a prize
So these three chariots
They're all racing towards the castle
And Maeve asks Findevar
To describe the chariot
And she says, I see another chariot's coming along the plane
Give us its description, Quothmive
I see in Sooth
So this is a Sooth sayer
Which is kind of almost like a prophecy
It's the kind of sea with a second sight
And basically she describes the horse coming
And then when you get onto the description of Cuckullen
This is what they have to say
In the chariot a sad melancholy man
Cummliest of the men of Errin
Around him a soft crimson pleasing tunic
Fastened across the breast where it stands open
With a salmon brooch of inlaid gold
Against which his bosom heaves beating in full strokes
And then it goes to describe in great detail his horses
And then it says
Set in each of his eyes eight red dragon gemstones
His two cheeks blue white and blood red
He emits sparks of fire and burning breath
With a ray of love in his look
A shower of pearls may thinketh have fallen into his mouth
Each of his two eyebrows as black as the side of a black spit
On his two thighs rests his golden hilted sword
And fastened to the copper frame of the chariot
Is his blood red spear
It goes on and just describes him
But you can basically, I can tell here that there's an underlying theme
There's a second meaning to this script in my opinion
And I can kind of see some of the images that I get from your work
And from what I've seen from your presentations
What do you think, Old Boy, about the prophetic side?
So you've got that tradition in Monmust's work
Of Merlin being that prophet, right?
Somehow he has stepped outside
And he's able to have this uncanny ability to understand the future
In the present
So he's always, he's beyond everybody's reach
That oracular power of the Sibyl is associated with specific drug co-ritual
So I guess what I'm asking is
Does this thing just thrive in nature?
Do we just have it coming over and over again?
Are we perpetuating a priesthood through time?
Or is this something that just spontaneously erupts?
How is Merlin that oracular prophet?
