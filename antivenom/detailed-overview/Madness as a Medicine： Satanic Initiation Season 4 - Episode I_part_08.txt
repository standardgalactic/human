How has he captured that role?
So much so that the prophets, the prophets that Dioscorides are talking about
Are claiming that these are their base powers
These drugs are their base powers
So is Merlin, first of all, is Merlin a drug user?
And second of all, what's the real power of prophecy here?
And is it natural? Is it just coming up or is it some kind of, you know
Some kind of perpetuation of a priestly thing?
So in Geoffrey of Monmust's work
It's clearly seen as a really important aspect of the community as well I suppose
Because one of the kings is desperate to get Merlin back
He takes off into the woods
And Geoffrey of Monmouth himself is clearly familiar with the Greek classics
I've seen people describe his Vita Merlin
It's actually written in hexameter from what I've seen
And he mentions and cites quite a lot of these works
Such as Ovid, Epistles from Pontus, things like this
And he compares Merlin to Silenus to some degree in the life of Merlin
And he takes off into the woods
Because he doesn't want anything to do with money, people
He just wants to live in the woods with the animals and the trees and nature
And he's obsessed with his apple trees
So there's always mention of these apples
And actually Avalon, where Arthur later goes when he's wounded
That comes from the Avalon, comes from the word apple as well
It means the Isle of Apples
So there's always these mention of the apples as well
So I personally do believe that there was drug use going on
And there was an early writer called Camden, I believe, if memory serves
And he actually says that the Celtic Bellis or Bellinus comes from Hembein
Because the Welsh language, funnily enough, also kind of letters mutate
So the beginning of a word, the letter can change
A bit like in the Greek, you know, how it tunes the words when they run into each other
So they sound better
The Welsh kind of does the same
And a contraction of Bellin would be melin, which means yellow
So it's something to do with this yellow bright god
And obviously belting, the burning these big fires, the worshiping the god bell
So I think looking at the cultures as well
Where the scene is, you know, breathing in this fumigation and taking on the qualities of the deity
It seems to tick the boxes for me personally anyway
Yeah, nice, gorgeous, gorgeous
It always comes back to those apples of the disparities, doesn't it?
And it's almost as if nature has a state that you can discover
That you can go there and discover and that you have clues along the way
And it's putting it together and finding it
And all of a sudden when you found that, you get weird things like this great healer
Right, when you said Merlin takes Arthur there, right?
He takes him to be healed, right, to her
So I mean, there's a reason that Cersei kills Odysseus and brings him back to life
Right, and lycophron is the one who brings that in
So there's something about these
I've often wondered, oh boy, if it is not the case that through time
The Sibyl propagates herself
And that the Romans weren't as crazy as we thought they were
Because they said that very thing
Even the smarty Greeks with their Heraclitus
Understood the power of the propagation of the Sibyl
Was it a fact that she lived over a thousand years?
Was it a fact that she always appeared to be a teenager?
Was it a fact that she gave the laws that start our civilization?
And I mean us, modern, you know, on both sides of the pond
Right, that civilization, we are what we are because of these traditions
And these traditions, look at the Hinbein
These traditions are rooted in some advanced pharmacology
That holds great promise for medicine
If you can take a substance like scopolamine or atropine
And under the right circumstances
You can cause somebody to enter that maniac phase
And then bring them out of it
And they achieve some sort of re-circuiting
Re-organization, re-orientation of the brain
I don't know what it is, the neuro guys will figure it out
But yeah, there's something there
We can't overlook this
Oh boy, thank you for coming tonight
And I know that I will have much demand to bring you back
Please continue this research
I want to be creating a history for us here
Where we can see the movements of these things
I had somebody just ask me what happened
You know, when the symbols failed
When the flame died out
The Iraqi flame died out
And Christianity took over and oppressed that movement
Is that where we lost progress medically?
Is that where we slowed ourselves down?
Yeah, with this history nobody studies this stuff
But now that they found the Hinbein
Thank goodness they found Hinbein
Because I thought this wasn't going to be sexy at all
But now it's totally sexy
Filters, can I ask you one last question?
And then I'm going to go
I'll be at the meeting tonight on Lady Babylon
But I want to ask you this
What is the sex connection?
Everything you've been reading about
What have you gotten, just like a general sense of the sex connection?
