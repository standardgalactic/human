Yeah. Hey, be careful.
I'll do his head, his hairs, three case.
They're white. They're not blonde.
They're white. His lady hair is white.
Do you get the feeling?
I know I rocketed us into that text tonight.
But do you get the feeling that something's wrong?
Do you get a little nausea?
A little bit sensation?
Wait a minute.
That nausea you're feeling is because this work is written by a symbol and restructured
with very obvious little, oh, and that person that that was talking about is Jesus.
Little inserts.
Yeah, they called the early Christian Sybilis for a reason, right?
Sybilis. Who is the daughter?
Who is the daughter?
It's herophily that Sybil.
Who is the daughter of the lamia?
The lamia.
Hang on.
We're almost there to her.
I'm showing you vampire Jesus who sucks the blood of little boys.
Vampire Jesus who sucks the blood of little boys.
There we go.
What's after his white wig?
Verse 15.
This feet looks like Halkolibanos is a word that's just two words slammed together.
One of them is bronze.
It's where we get the calc root.
And the other word is used for incense.
You know, the problem is we don't have a lot of references to these two words being smashed together.
So it really should mean literally bronze incense.
You mean his feet, his bottom of his legs are like bronze incense?
Wow, that's kind of strange.
So we translated this, not we, but you know, the king and his men translated this as bronze in reflection or bronze in color, right?
Brazen, his bronze feet.
Why does Jesus have bronze feet?
White wig and lingerie.
Because he's got that phon√©, that voice, which is the voice Houdaton, polon, the voice of many waters.
The voice of many waters.
What better?
Sybil.
Is then she who is the granddaughter of ocean.
Herophaly, the great daughter of Lamia.
Why would you bring up Lamia? Who's Lamia?
Lamia is a Libyan queen.
