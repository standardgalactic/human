We were resurrecting Euripides.
And Euripides brings us pentheus.
With his white wig.
And his new vision in order to make it.
In order to reach that death and resurrection mystery.
You have to be wearing your women's kit.
Remember, this is an ancient religion that is created by women.
Women who are not sitting at home,
but women who were experimenting with pharmaceuticals.
Women who were delivering babies.
Women who were stopping other women from bleeding to death.
This is that type of woman.
So when Jesus finds himself on the cross.
You and I follow the fairy tale.
And we say, this is a translation of some Hebrew.
No, it's not.
There isn't any Hebrew going around in the first century.
Yeah.
This is a Christos.
That is a Greek concept.
I was telling my class last Saturday of the superiority of ancient Greek.
And why it is that we have the expression.
It's Greek to me, right?
And not why don't we say it about every other language?
And why did the Romans say that about Greek?
There's a reason for that.
There's a scientific reason for that.
And it's my job to push those students into the place that they can absorb that.
They can see that superior functioning of the language and they can benefit from it.
How do they do that?
By the translation.
So when we have a text like the apocalypse,
and John is writing about a very specific woman called the morning star.
When he's writing about her and has to insert Jesus,
he just freely does so.
Does it bother him that she is wearing feminine garb?
No, John writes it, right?
He leaves it in because she's the morning star and we all know what the morning star does.
We all know her.
We all know her.
We know she drinks the blood of young boys.
We know that she does is Jesus in invoking lamea from the cross,
screaming about how thirsty he is.
If he invokes the goddess herself of this history,
past that comes to Libya and Georgia,
which are somehow connected thanks to the civilians, right?
