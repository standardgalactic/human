Love it.
Here she is.
If he is invoking this right,
we give him a reason to be arrested in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy.
What was that bandage doing?
What was that bandage doing?
By the way, for those of you who want to make Jesus's bandages underwear,
there's a tendency for translators to do that.
Yeah, you know that you're wrong.
You know that there's no word there for what soldiers and hunters,
anybody else who's girding up their loins, puts on.
Kid doesn't have it.
He's Gumnos.
But he does have a bandage with him.
We know these bandages are impregnated with drugs.
And does he have a bandage because his lamea invoking boy,
the only blood-sucking vampire God is with him in the garden.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we're getting closer.
I think we're getting closer to seeing.
In order to see Jesus, you have to see lamea.
You have to see lamea.
There's a reason that they're described the way they are.
The language is a fingerprint.
It preserves the crime scene, preserves the evidence that we need.
It's like the amber that preserves the mosquito.
So we have the old DNA from 40 million years ago.
Yeah.
Nice.
For those of you, I'm providing.
Thank you for coming tonight.
I'm hoping that you are seeing.
That you are seeing that point in history for what it is.
We should be able to see that now in the present.
Should be able to bring that past and then that future together.
The daughter of lamea is the civil herophily.
That's what everything is about.
That's why we early Christians call ourselves civilists.
That's why we don't care when the Romans call us civilists.
John is preserving those sibling works.
Those sibling visions.
Beautiful.
Next Saturday, I'll be having the class again in the morning.
That time is set, but I want to announce that tomorrow.
At 9 a.m.
Mountain Standard,
