I will be opening the dojo for people to come in and to work out.
Because I want this class that's proceeding to be the best of the best.
I have to work with them to really exercise.
I'm providing that time for you.
If you can come, great.
If you can't find it'll be in the dough.
It'll be on the discord.
Every time that we start this program again,
we repost the discord.
Anybody who wants to show up can do that.
Anybody from the class who wants to come tomorrow at 9 o'clock,
please show up.
We'll drill.
We'll work out.
We'll get exercised.
I appreciate your diligence.
I think we're going to stop there tonight.
I want you to thank those of you who will be coming to our special Valentine's show,
which will be next Friday.
When you come to the Valentine's show,
those of you who have the strength to be considered sons of Heracles,
to put on the ivy, to put on the dress, to put on the woman's kit,
those of you who have that courage to stand for the image that we are bringing.
If we want to, I mean, come on, what are we all doing here?
We're trying to expose.
We're trying to bring this investigation to a conclusion.
We don't want to be here forever.
None of us wants to join a cult.
None of us wants to become known in the future for our associations as a cult.
We want to see the reality.
We want to bring that to the world.
That's what we are here doing.
Those of us who are dressing up, great.
It should be a lot of fun.
It should be a lot of fun.
I hope that everybody is comfortable.
This will all be above the board, just a group of men discussing themselves and history
and wearing the kit of Lady Babylon.
Have a good evening.
Is that horse called destiny?
I think she ran off without me.
