So while all of this is going on
Maria's brother, her sungunos
The person who's in the same clan
Her brother, poetic way of saying brother
And he is what kind of brother?
He's a barugunos
He's not too good on his feet
He's kind of weighed down
He's got heavy knees, right?
He's got heavy knees
And why does he got heavy knees?
Because he is Himaseto
He's struck
It's the idea, think about the person with the whip
The person with the whip, the mastic
Right, right
And when you apply that whip, that mastic
What happens to the person, go back to the text
Look where he is, look where he is
He's in a thermal atmoid
What?
He's in a hot vein
He's in a hot vapor
He's in a hot vapor
That is Nusalaos
Wait, what is Nusalaos?
Brings your vein
Yeah
It's a disease
You got in your flesh
Brings it out, those vapors
We know who invented this practice
That he is talking about
We'll call her Medea
Lovely, we're still not to the dirty part though
So where is this brother Lazarus?
He's out vaping
He's out vaping in the pirate grotto
Fantastic, we put a stone over his tomb
Place smelled terrible
Jesus was like, don't worry, he's not dead
And everybody's like, huh?
And he comes, roll away stone
Out he stumbles, right?
Yes, a perfect historical description
Of the drug sex cult machinations
Of those who wish to be born again
Yeah
You wondered why Jesus was hanging around
In the cemeteries all the time
You wondered
The one place he gets caught with the naked kid
You would think that we would put it together
Yeah, lovely, lovely
Let's go to that same source
We've lapped it up, we've got all of it
There's that bottom line, pull off that
Yep, yep, no, we got it
He's that container, baby
He's that container of the burn
Woo, you want to get resurrected?
You got to go, it was on that fourth day, right?
Why was it on that fourth day?
We knew Jesus got up and walked away
How did Lazarus get up and walk away?
They knew, they knew from the drugs
Exactly how long that death and resurrection
Would take place
All notice is doing is describing it to you
He's given away the secrets
And he's doing it in beautiful Greek
Beautiful Greek, let's go to the next text
Whatever we have after that, let's see
There's a couple things in here I wanted you to see
The atmos, notice that the atmos
You know, of incense, the vapors
Yeah, okay, okay
Going back to what Medea created
Good, give me another
When you get a chance, give me the next
The next entry after that one
Whatever it is, good
Pull down Bible studies, fantastic
Lazarus, who is Lazarus?
He's the one that Jesus philaeos
Uh oh, is the text pretty explicit?
Yeah, it is
It is, it even says
He's got that familial love for all three of them
But he's fancies, he fancies Lazarus
We'll leave that, that's hearsay
That's not going to hold it in transdimensional court
Right, people want to say
Yeah, look
No, come on
Come on, let's be adults
Right, we don't have any problem with patroclus
Right, we got over that
A couple of centuries ago
Patroclus and Achilles, they were lovers
