Greeks were like, yeah, so
Right, there's no homosexuality
Until Christianity invents it
Up until that time with the Greeks
It's just one of those things, you know
Sex here, sex there
Polls, balance
Yeah, have a good life
Fantastic, let's go to the
Let's go to the
Back to that passage
Oh god, you're going to love it people
You're going to love it
Now having said that before
I just want to make a note
I have read some texts
From antiquity
That were very derogatory
So it's not like
Homosexuality hasn't been
A target, but no more so
Than every other type
And ethnicity
The point is that
Theality
Of homosexuality
Sets itself in western civilization
After the rise of Christianity
Correct? Fantastic
Love it
Let's go to this text, pull up that text
Okay, here it is people, I know
Thank you for waiting, 28 minutes
I'll try to get it quick
Yeah, he says, look at the end of this
Excuse me
Ithopinusoi
Ithopi, what is that?
It all sounds good, do you see the hallelujah?
What is he doing? The one that Jesus
Is particularly fond of
What is he doing? He's out hallelujahing
He's out what? Yeah
He's out hallelujahing
He's on drugs
Let me pull the text up again, he's got me on drugs
This doesn't make sense
Unless these people, are there drugs there?
Are there drugs there?
Ithopi, how's he doing it?
He's doing it within that flame
Is this a cold term? Yup
Yup, it is
You're kidding, no I'm not
He is in that bane of the fire
The fire's bane, that disease you get
Everybody here knows it
It's eros, you ever get the fire?
When you look and you see across the way
And you meet eyes, right?
Could be out in the middle of nowhere
But you hit, boom and you can feel the arrow
That arrow burns, in antiquity
That arrow burns you all the way to the marrow
And that's where your noda are
That's where your essence comes from
Huh, that fire is what he is in
He is in that burning, that flesh burns
Paul is, oh I just have a thorn in my flesh
You junkie, you junkie
You evangelicals follow junkies
Junkies
Are you ready? Let's do it
Give me the next Greek name
Yeah, this is fantastic, look at the end of the first line
So she says Koirane, and she uses this old title
For Jesus, to address Jesus
Koirane, why didn't you use the, you know, Curios
Isn't that, isn't that, well, what does the Koirane have?
It has an older sense to it
This is the master, this is the master
She says I know, right?
And I know that you're that one
Who is in this organization, in this world system
That we can't see, I know that you are the Christ
I know that you're the Logos
I know that you're the Son
And who is he the Son of?
Not just anybody, but of Alexi Kakoio Theu
Of the ill, or the poison of hurting
Zeus, this is who you are
You're the one who's the child of that God
Who averts ill, who averts poison
Who averts disaster
This is you
Yeah, all of a sudden, with those few titles
That we know exactly who we're talking about, Colt was
Gorgeous Jesus, just tell us one more dirty thing
That Mary's gonna do
Give us one more, I want you to see this
