Right, where's the...
Look, it's not me, give me another of the Greek
I think it's that one, Thespacios
Let's see, no, that's not it
Let's go out, is it this one?
Nope, let's send it one more
That's the eating
No, oh darn it, we'll come across it later
Yeah, the eating, I'm sorry
Don't spoil your dinner but
Here we go, are you ready?
Bring the text up, let's just give it to them
Okay, here we go, I'm just gonna translate the whole thing
Okay, so
Mary took up that marble
That is used for plugging holes, right
And carrying the dew
And she did what?
She anointed, massaged
Applied the oil, right
To the feet, those oracular
Those oracular feet
Those prophetic feet
That future telling feet thing
And what does she do?
She anointed those that belong
To her dino minu basileus
Her what?
Her king, her king who is what?
Dino minu
Her king
Who is eating her
Her king who is consuming the communion
Her king who is the Christed one
Why do you think Mary had to be?
Had to be that one who brings
The God S
The A
Yeah, the God S
Not the Thos
Yes
How did she have to bring that?
He has to be consuming her
He has to be consuming her
Yes, and if you look up
If you look it up, you'll see that
It's used with respect to specific drugs
And what specific drugs are there?
Oh, well, it's the Eos
Are you surprised?
No, you shouldn't be
This is a circus where we can track the drugs perfectly
We always know what's going on if we're watching the drugs
And what is she doing?
She is producing this drug
She is producing it
She brings the dew
She brings the dew
Okay, so bring it up again
Let's see that last
Okay, and what happens?
Well, it's an orgy, people
So ultimately everybody is going to get involved
Right, look at what she's doing
Now you know why Gregory pardoned her
Right, for using, if this is the same one
For using the sex drugs
Gregory was talking about it
Anyway, so on the next line
What does it say?
Hectadye
Yeah, look at the next line
15 Ichmada, what is she doing?
She's harvesting that Ichmada
Spread wide
Hectadye
And what kind of Ichmada is it?
It's pialein
What is pialein?
You know that
Some fluids can be clear like water
Can behave like water
Some fluids from antiquity
We're talking like the docs did in antiquity
And some fluids can be sticky
They can stick together
So as Galen says, you can take your finger
And you can take the fluid
And you can stretch your fingers
And the fluid makes a little string
Because it's viscous
Yeah, it's kind of thick
Kind of like flim
Yes, right
Right, well we've got that here
We've got that here
In Mary's hair
Right, and she is spread out all over
Hmm, interesting
Okay, I'm trying to get a picture
