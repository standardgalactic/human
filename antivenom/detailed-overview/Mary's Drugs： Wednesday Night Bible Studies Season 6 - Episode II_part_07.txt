Let's bring the verse back
Get exactly what it is
Yeah, and where is it going?
It's going into her magladi
Hitei
And for those of you who think this is not dirty
I want to take you to the maglos
Hitei is her hair
She's known for this hair of the priestess
You know what's in the hair of the priestesses?
The drugs and the sacred body fluids
What?
Yes, the drugs and the communion
The drugs and the communion
It's in the hair
It's not just in their regular hair
Right, it's in there
Show me the text again
It's in this type of hair
Look at that last line
Magladi on the second to last line
Give me the Greek from the next
And it'll give us a little trail here
No, this is by the way
This is what Jesus is consuming
This is what Jesus is doing
And I just wanted you to see
They do it of poisons as well
To feast on
What is Jesus doing to Mary?
He's feasting on her
Right?
He's feasting on her
Unless you eat my flesh
And drink my blood
You got no place in the kingdom
Some people are born eunuchs
And some are made eunuchs for the kingdom
You got no place with me
Unless you eat my flesh
You know what he's doing to her?
He is eating her flesh
In that flesh
In Greek
In that flesh
Is that water of life
And there's only one way to get there
And Paul is tired of doing it
He doesn't want to do it anymore
Thorn in my flesh
Oh, God
You didn't know they were so creepy, did you?
It's the drugs, man
You just trace down the...
Look at the drugs they're using
Fantastic
Let's go back to it
One more
Here's a little tiny bit of dirtiness left
For those...
Oh, mochlos
We still didn't get to the mochlos
Keep going
Just so people can see it
Machladi here is what we've got in the text
The next Greek
Probably right there
No, this is what's going on
Methusco
People are getting inebriated
People are getting intoxicated
Getting intoxicated
Next one
Fantastic
Oh, God
Fantastic
Oh, here's from before
That awful and natural
That oracular
That madness that this stuff gets us into
Love it
Next one
Next one
Here's the mochlos, right?
Look at it
Oh, my goodness
What is it?
Wanton
Wanton or luxuriant
The next one gives a little bit more definition
Here we go
Lude or lustful of women
You women out there
This is only for you
You mean the Greeks have a word
That just expresses the wantonness
The luxuriant wantonness
Of a woman
Yeah
Because you don't have it, dude
