You don't have it
Some eunuchs are made eunuchs
For the kingdom of heaven
You want that attraction?
Yeah
When you're in a cult
There's only one doorway
And it's right here
With that mochlos
That's how her hair is described
In which she is receiving
She is receiving what?
The ikmas
She is receiving Jesus' body fluid
Of communion
Love it
They used to call it haima
Blood
They used to call semen
From both men and women
Blood
It's the essence
Love it
Let's go down
We've got a couple more slides
And we're done
This is fantastic
We're right here at the climax
What kind of...
By the way, this is all stuff to drink
That PLAos that I told you
We were translating before
Notice that it's used of drinks
And notice for my Greek students
Nikander
Look at that bottom source
Aposis is a potion
It's for peon
For drinking
And it gives us the Hippocratic diseases of women
Notice that bottom source is Nikander
Nikander
As soon as you get Nikander
You know where you are
You know what kind of terms are being used
And he's a priest
He's a priest of these resurrection rites
He's a healer
Right?
Apollo
Love it
Love it
Let's go to the next one
Yeah
That's okay
That's not a big deal
And then finally
Finally on the bottom
I wanted you guys to see this
Just blow this up for me, Chewie
What is happening to everybody else?
Says the Bible
Right?
Says knownness
What's happening?
They're spreading it
It's not just happening to Jesus
He's not just laying there with Mary
Right?
Exchanging body fluids
Feasting on Mary
He's not just
He's not just doing that
Everybody else gets in on it
And how are they getting in on it?
They're being
Steeped
In
The
Vapors
They're being made drunk
With the vapers
And I just want to bring up that last Greek slide
Chewie, the last Greek text that we did
Look at the very last line
Nechomene
What is she doing?
What's Mary doing?
You can see her on the floor
Right?
And what is she doing?
Spread over Jesus?
And what is she doing with her marble?
She is swimming
She's what?
She is swimming
In the fumes
Of this in-theotic drug
This drug that puts the God inside of you
This place is made
