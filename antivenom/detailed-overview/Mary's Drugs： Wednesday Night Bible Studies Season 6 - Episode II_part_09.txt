It says on the bottom line in Methodism
It made the whole household
Made the whole household
Stoned
It intoxicated
Do you remember Medea intoxicating people
Against their will with the fumigations?
That is exactly what is going on here
Do we know what happened to the rest of the disciples
That were with them?
Who became intoxicated?
We do not
But I can tell you this for a fact
A satyr is a satyr
And a satyr will just as soon
Enter into coitus
With another satyr
As they will anyone else
Yeah
Interesting
Those are real rights
Those are orgia
That's that orgia
Yeah
That's the real thing
It's quite a picture
It's quite a picture
And I'm afraid
Following Mary's pardon
For the sex drugs
I'm afraid
This went downhill
Yeah
It went downhill
Now we're going to watch that
We're going to track that
Because when we bring the case to court
To trans-dimensional court
And we've got Jesus
And we've got his naked boy from Mark 14, 51, 52
We have everything built up with his child trafficking
And the drugs that they're using
I want these drugs as evidence
That Muron, that Nardon
I want those things there
I want the Ich Mada
The Ich Mas
I want that on display
When Jesus is sitting in the witness stand
Because you know
He's going to go ahead and try to take it
He's going to be dumb enough to think he can take the witness stand
You know when we hold up
That body fluid from
Dude, genetic test is genetic test, right?
Evidence is evidence
Is this your bodily fluids, Jesus
And the hair of Mary
Is this your bodily fluid
Is this your dew
Did you, Jesus Christ
Sit there with Mary
With a marble alabaster
That is built to drug you
By plugging your portals
Jesus
Was Mary using it on Jesus
It's the sex drug
That is covered
On the medicated dildo
That would be inducing him
To have that death and resurrection
You know, what is she doing?
She's foretelling my death
Yeah, right?
Oh, now I see
I wish I'd have known all the dirty details
In the meantime
And I would not have devoted time
To the worship of this duo
Yeah, corruption of the rights, people
Corruption of the rights
Let's not let one bad egg
Arrested with a naked kid
Let's not let him taint
Our classical heritage
Let's get the text back
And let's tell the story
Let him see him
The answer is not apologetics
The answer is letting them see Jesus
Hail Satan
We could walk together again
Just maybe we could walk together again
