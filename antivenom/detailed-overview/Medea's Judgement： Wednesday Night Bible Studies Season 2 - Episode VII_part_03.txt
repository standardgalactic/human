Let's see.
So she, um, Jean met a charm.
That's not her name.
Jean met a charming handsome upperclassmen.
His father was a deacon at mother Kirk.
Right.
So he met her at church by her second year.
They started dating and soon he said he wanted to marry her.
I had stars in my eyes.
Remember, Jean.
But then he got physical.
I was a virgin and it scared me within their first year of dating, heavy petting, turned the course of sex.
He'd get her drunk and refused to accept her wishes, not to have sex.
He refused condoms.
Jean, who had been raised on a steady diet of purely movement books.
Felt like she had no choice but to marry him.
There's that entity.
There's that sanctity of marriage right in your face.
This is the sanctity.
Right.
As we're going in, we're getting ready to burn the bride.
Right.
This sank sanctity of marriage.
This is, this is their idea.
Yeah.
Jean, who had been raised on a steady diet of purity movement books, felt like she had no choice but to marry him.
Somehow unclean and unworthy.
Before they got married, she joined the church, taking covenant vows in front of the congregation.
After her vows, Kirk came up and shook her hand saying how beautiful she was.
Ew.
Okay.
Can I just say, just leave it on me.
I just wanted to get this on me.
Gross, first of all, inappropriate and gross, but watch this.
That's a big deal.
She says to men in leadership, they brag about how their women are more beautiful than pagan wives.
Yeah.
This is now here and now.
Right.
This is what's going on.
The wedding.
Leave me up there, please.
The wedding officiated by Wilson.
