Okay.
It was four years after she moved to Moscow, starting nine months after they were married.
They had a baby every other year until the couple had four children.
One night after their first was born, her husband came home drunk after she was asleep.
He pulled her over, lifted her nightgown.
She told him not tonight that she was tired.
He got angry.
She tried clawing away, then pushing him away with her arms.
He pinned her down so she used her legs to kick him.
That's when he unbuttoned his pants.
And Jean says, when he was done, he passed out drunk and I locked myself in the bathroom and cried.
She was bruised and her insides bled.
She called a Kirker friend about it the next day.
The friend attended a Christ Church plant, a seedling congregation based in Christ Church's doctrine and culture.
Wait a minute.
What?
Remember what Tom said?
Thomas Jefferson said, greatest threat to the fledgling American democracy is the Christian church.
Yeah.
Look at it.
See it for what it is.
You people have gone back.
You've seen the Bacchic movements.
You've seen the Christianity that was oppressed and attempted to be suppressed and put out before they burned down Rome.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now you understand why the Romans were all about if it doesn't interfere with government, right?
They're not trying to stop the government.
They don't care what they do.
But it's when they step over that line.
Wilson is not only across that line.
He is miles beyond it with an army, with an army of what you and I could come up with names for.
But maybe victims is one of one of the names you might come up with.
Yeah.
I hate to put gene in that category.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
She said the woman that she talked to said the same thing was going on in her marriage.
Marital rape, it seemed, was normal.
So gene didn't report it.
Gene's husband raped her over and again a couple of times a week for about a decade.
Seriously?
Yeah.
