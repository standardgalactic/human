I identify Ukraine, obviously, nationality-wise.
I was born in Ukraine.
I was raised in Ukraine.
It's my country.
It's my people, obviously.
But ethnically, I'm Greek and I'm also partially Polish and partially Russian.
You're Greek.
I know the last bit, the last bits things.
The person who wrote this is probably likes you 10 times more now because he's also fluent in Greek.
Oh, cool.
You can know the person that wrote this, yeah.
He's probably like, what if I just blew his mind right now?
Yeah, my father was Greek, basically, full-on.
And yeah, he was killed, unfortunately, in July by Russian artillery.
So, yeah.
So, I don't know about the ancestors, what they think about this whole mess.
But I do think this is a generational battle.
It's like generations prior of Ukrainians have fought the same battle against Russian imperialism and oppression.
And they fought for our right to exist as a country and to rule ourselves.
All my life, I was raised with American flag.
I thought I owned liberty and democracy.
I thought I owned these things.
And today I saw somebody, I saw that oracular voice come right out of time and space and bring itself alive.
Yeah, yeah.
Her father was killed.
Anastasia's father was killed by Vlad Putin.
Vlad Putin, who is also, as Anastasia pointed out,
connected with groups that are religious groups that are pushing an LGBTQ plus destruction,
destruction, total destruction, wipe them out.
Right?
This is the type of person who goes to the protest and gets the bruises.
She's the one.
Anastasia.
Shame on us.
Shame on us.
Right?
Now we have a chance.
We have a chance to do something here.
We have a chance to somehow be involved with this rebirth, this historic rebirth of the spirit of democracy, of Athena herself.
Right?
Next one, please.
So it's something we deal with, I guess, the same thing as they did before.
And I do think that ancestors of Ukrainian people, I guess you could say, would be very proud for us continuing their fight.
