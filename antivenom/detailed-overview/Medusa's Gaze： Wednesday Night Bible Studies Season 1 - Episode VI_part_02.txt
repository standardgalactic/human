Oh, rythmic, rythmic, rythmic, rythmic, rythmic.
Beautiful.
So, um, uh, uh, what else is she?
She is the Megal Onume, the one with the great name, right?
The Antrodiaite, the one who exists in your antrum.
What is your antrum?
Your antrum is the center point of your temple.
Your antrum is the center point of your temple.
So the cult image, the cult image is what is preserved in that central place.
That is where she works.
Nice.
If you climb the hill of the Acropolis up to the Parthenon, you can reach that focal point,
that antrum.
Yes.
Originally, this is a cave.
This is a cave.
Right?
Excellent.
Um, remember Medusa is the priestess of Athena.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right?
Excellent.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
Because if we want to see the savior, that's who we're looking for.
Who is this savior?
Who is this only begotten of God?
Yeah.
Hed iepes, acthus.
What does she do?
She travels these high mountains, these high mountains, the focal point.
She is at the focal point of the mountain with the imagery is great here,
with her head thrown back, with her head thrown back.
Bordering on the word can also mean pride.
Right?
Not necessarily the bad way.
Almost a strutting.
A strutting.
Excellent.
And on the next line, on the next line, please.
Yeah, one before that.
Yes.
So there we are.
One after that.
Yeah.
Eid o rea.
Right?
Eid o rea ski o enta.
She also masters those shaded mountains.
Those shaded mountains.
You didn't think Athena was the mistress of the shaded mountain, did you?
No, but now you do.
And she focuses her mind.
She focuses her mind upon not only the mountain, but the meadows.
Right?
Not only the ridges, but the meadows, where the cities are built,
where the villages are developed over time.
She is the one who works there.
Are we seeing Athena?
There's a lot more to the onlyborn than you thought.
And this onlyborn is prophesied of.
We know it because Jehovah says, I'm going to be overcome by my monochines.
And that's why he consumes her mother.
He consumes her because he doesn't want to get overthrown.
He doesn't want to get overthrown.
Jehovah is a poopy guy.
He's a poopy guy and he wants to stay in power.
He doesn't want to relinquish his power.
Right?
So this is the way of forcing him to relinquish it,
to give her the birth.
And this comes through the Hephaestus.
Right?
It comes through the craft.
How do you open the head of Jehovah to give birth to his daughter?
Yeah.
We'll do one more line and we'll check in.
We'll check in with Mateus.
I want you to see on the next line.
Yes.
At the bottom there, Hoplauhares.
Right?
She is the one that, you know, she's delighting in the Hoplauhaun, the weapons.
She loves the weapons.
She's always pictured with that spear.
When she comes out of Zeus's head, the monochines, she comes out naked,
carrying one thing and one thing on.
She got no helmet.
She got no shield.
She got nothing.
She has a spear and it scares us all.
Here's this six foot tall hybrid viper girl.
It must have been spectacular in antiquity to see her.
It must have been spectacular to know one of these viper girls and to be like, wow.
You know, impressed.
Their eyes supposedly were bloodshot all the time and they used these poisons that they put
in their hair and or archers.
They're an archer horse culture.
Yeah.
Isn't that cool?
Yeah.
