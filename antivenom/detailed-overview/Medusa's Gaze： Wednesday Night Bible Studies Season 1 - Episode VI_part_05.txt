Yeah.
Do you see?
It's not fairytale.
We're talking about people in time.
We're talking about drugs.
We're talking about ritual and performance.
And we're talking about a hybrid girl who is handing down judgments
and telling you the future.
Wow.
This is Athena.
Athena is not what she thought she was.
Is she?
Okay.
Metis, at the end of that line, Metis.
Metis is who she's born from.
Metis, that mind, that capacity, that is not masculine.
It is feminine mental capacity.
Love it.
It's love it.
Gorgeous.
What is she?
She's an Iolomorph.
Oh, that's interesting.
What if you trace the different Iolomorphs?
You'll understand what class she belongs to.
She takes the different forms.
She has the spots on the skin, like the spotted serpent.
Have you ever seen her legs?
It's a tale of a spotted serpent.
Isn't that gorgeous?
That's fantastic.
Lamea, right?
It's the lameatic.
You know, she comes from North Africa.
She is Tritagonae after all, right?
The one from Triton, the lake.
Right?
Beautiful, beautiful.
Okay, anyway.
And right after Iolomorph, right after Iolomorph,
want to make sure you're getting, nope.
Next one.
Bump.
Yep, there we go.
Look what I've underlined in red.
Yeah, Drachyna.
Did you know Athena was a Drachyna?
The Drachyna is the Draco.
You know, the serpent.
The one who has the combination of the milk and the blood.
And you say milk.
How is she milking?
Yes, we are milking her.
She is nursing.
Right?
Because she has this.
This hybrid has this chemical that we sow value,
the galaneae, that comes from her breasts.
And they're described as grape-like.
Grape-like.
There's an exodate from them that we use.
Remember, she's been on venom since she was seven.
And how do they, oh, by the way,
how do they put them on venom?
What I have seen textually is lateral slits.
Lateral slits that are covered up with a drug impregnated bandage.
Yeah, so you go for the day and you get your,
you get your bandage, right?
And you get your, make your cut.
So these aren't, it's not bleeding like a cut until it bleeds.
And then, right?
Do it, right?
Medication.
She's shown that, right?
By the older priestesses.
So when she's at that age at seven,
that's when she's brought in.
So this is a process of building someone.
Yes, yes, building the onlyborn.
And remember, you are not to enter the bed.
You're not to enter the bed of mating, we'd say.
To them, the image of the bed was the image of that coupling,
of that coming together.
And you weren't supposed to do that.
And if you did, you lost your head, right?
And what is she?
What is this holy virgin gymnast?
What does she wear on her chest,
on the skin that's on her chest?
She wears the head of the medusa.
Nice, nice, nice.
Gorgeous, gorgeous.
How's our head coming along?
Do we have a medusic head?
Don't you love the gyrations?
Whenever Mateus is able to bring life to her,
he moves her around and you see,
you can see he's able to bring out,
because he has that art.
He's able to bring out that emotion,
that image, that feeling.
This is why we need artists, man,
to make our idols, right?
