Thank you.
This is antiquity, brah.
It's gorgeous, gorgeous.
What is after Drachyna?
Bring up Drachyna again.
What is after Drachyna?
She's not only the serpent queen.
She is also feel infea.
And Dr Ruck,
those of you who know Dr Ruck will like it,
by the way, I saw some people posted some stuff
about Dr Ruck and like it.
They like his work, fantastic, phenomenal.
He was the one that I stood with in Boston
when we were talking about Harvard.
And his research is, of course,
outstanding because he works with the sources, right?
He does it.
You can't get by anything with him.
He's a scientist, right?
He brings you the sources.
Anyway, Dr Ruck coined the word entheogen, right?
N being in theos, being the god and gen producing, right?
So what is an entheogen?
An entheogen is a substance that produces the god within.
Now, this is not.
This is, it's not like he just said,
oh, I'm going to cram some bases together
and coin a word.
Good for me, right?
No, he didn't do that, right?
This concept of entheosis, right?
In our text here, in our text,
she loves that infilling.
She loves it when the god becomes one with you.
Of course, that makes sense
because that's what the priestess is doing.
She is becoming Athena
so that when she has you under her spell
and she's got you bound and drugged
and she is singing in your ear
with that obrimosume,
with that thundering powerful, powerful voice.
Yeah, she is the Athenae.
She is the Athenae, right?
Wow, all we knew about Athena
was she's on the top of this acropolis.
It's the woman symbol of the Athens and her freedom.
Yes, that's what we thought.
But wait a minute, we're all the snakes
and we're all the, what is all the ritual?
What is she doing?
She's inspiring us, right?
She's the mother of the arts,
the virgin mother of the arts.
The virgin mother of the arts.
That's why she hangs around the temple
of the muse, right?
Temple of the muse, perfect.
Okay, and the last word, a glautine.
Flegrion altera.
I'm going to take you down to the giganton.
She's the fighter of the giants, right?
The dispeller of the giants.
She's the horse motivator,
the horse completer, the horse driver.
She's that tritogenea.
She's the destroyer of the cocoon
or the dissolver of the cocoon.
No, no such thing as pollution around this,
around this only born.
There's no pollution.
You can't, she can't stand in the presence of it, right?
She's in that antrum.
She's in that center of that temple.
Good.
And then finally, yes,
she's the victory-bringing daemon.
Victory-bringing daemon or Athena Nike, they call her, right?
The bringer of the victory.
That's her.
And finally, she's nocturnal and day of the day.
She's both of day and nights serving the orais, serving the hours.
What does that mean?
When you say serving the hours,
all of a sudden you project yourself back
into the bronze age with the worship of the orai.
The orai is the sun and the moon and the stars.
It is the sun and the moon and the stars.
You should see in her this royal beginning,
the sun and moon and stars.
Finally, the last three lines.
Cluthi mw, cluthi mw, cluthi mw el hominw.
Listen to me, hear me, praying.
Now, this is in the voice of the initiates, right?
As they're singing.
Hear me, praying.
Give polu obon erenyn.
Give the peace.
Provide the peace.
Provide the koron.
And people will translate this as wealth.
It's not.
