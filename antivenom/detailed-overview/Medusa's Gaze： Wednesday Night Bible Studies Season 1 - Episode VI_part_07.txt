It's satiety.
Koros is satiety.
Yeah, it's the sufficiency.
Give the sufficiency.
Peace, sufficiency.
Health, huyeon.
Yes.
And in these blessed orais and these hours, right?
At these times, what is he?
She's glauach off.
She has that.
It's often described as steel, blue or gray.
They don't really understand what this word means, though.
Steel, blue or gray ops eyes.
So they call her the gray eyed.
The gray eyed.
But that gray eyed, that epithet, the gray eyed,
belongs to that gorgophonic group, right?
The ones that bring that magic.
That's their gray eyed appearance.
Gray eyed.
It's a thing.
The ops is what you look.
Look, am I?
The ops is what you look into when you confront the goddess.
When you stand before her, you are in her ops.
And her ops is gray.
Steel, blue.
Yes.
Okay.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
How about the...
Yeah, she's the one who knows all the skill, man.
She's got all the skill.
If you want the skill, you go into her.
And she's the poluliste basileia.
The queen who is most prayed to.
The one who really accepts those,
that form of communication, right?
That prayer.
She's the one that you can bind,
that you can work with if you know her secret name.
Yes.
The half girl or virgin, half virgin, half viper.
And if you get 12 of these together in a group, you're invincible.
You're absolutely invincible.
12 archeruses with poison bows who use venoms.
None of you they use venoms,
but as you can see from our sculpture, she was raised on venom.
She was raised on venom.
So she is a different form.
You didn't know humanity was capable of this form, did you?
Now maybe you understand why they worshiped her.
Why they worshiped her.
Why they brought her out.
Why they took the children of the aristocracy.
Why they put them through if they had the perfect qualifications.
Why they put them through this regimen
in order to reach this process of the of the virgin.
Yeah.
The virgin lamia.
Yeah.
It's absolutely absolutely the pinnacle of the combo of drugs and cult.
And it is the mystery.
If you talk about Christianity as a mystery
and you fail to recognize what a mystery is, you have no clue.
You're believing the fairy tale, right?
You're following the fairy tale.
You're not looking at history and reason.
You're looking at the fairy tale.
Your faith will lead you to the fairy tale to accept it.
Reason will lead you to the reality, right?
And there's no question of whether or not you want to accept the reality
because the reality doesn't care.
Judaism and Christianity are the offshoot.
Are the offshoot of this oracular mystery.
She is Bronze Age.
She is before you.
And she manifests herself in the queen.
Yes, in the queen.
All of this pharmacology goes back somewhere.
And every signpost that I've seen
points directly to Colchis, to the witch Medea,
who is developing the echidna.
She alone, we know.
She alone can breathe that fire.
Yes.
Gorgeous.
Gorgeous.
Give me the ability.
Eason.
Eason.
People will tell you.
Okay.
I'm going to say one more thing and then I'm going to check back in with Rob
because I want to see the magic is happening.
We want to see that image and we don't want to get lost in the fairy tale.
We just want to know what those people were doing.
We want to push it and we want to say who is she?
What does she look like?
Where does she stand?
What does she do?
