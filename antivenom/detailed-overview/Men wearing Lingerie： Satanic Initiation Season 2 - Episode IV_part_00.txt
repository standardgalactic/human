Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met, I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that whore called Destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
What we've got on the plate for you tonight is a little bit odd
It's going to be off track
In order to keep you necromancers alive
We're going to be drawing up a spirit
But only near the end of our time
Although he is a lovely
Otherwise tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to depart
And we're going to talk about me
A little bio to answer your questions
And I cannot think of something that makes me more uncomfortable than this
So, because who wants to talk about themselves?
Right? Hit it
Before we get to the bio
I want to also mention that tomorrow at 10 a.m.
We will be having our first intensive Greek necromancy class
We're having it in the morning early on Saturdays
In order to accommodate people's time
10 o'clock mountain who are living across the pond
So hopefully our British contingent will be able to
Come and partake of the offerings
Which I'll talk about a little bit more in a minute
But somebody asked me today
Who are you?
They wanted to know because they're looking at a potential future in the area
They want to know who I am
And where I teach
Let me show you
I've made a little video
It's just a short video
But it encompasses some of the headlines
And a couple of images
And some nice music from Zane Campbell
Thank you very much Zane
And Chewie, roll it
I was lost in an airport
I walked outside onto a golf course
And somewhere on the green
I woke up from the dream
I had flown in from somewhere
I didn't know where I was going
Dreams are kind of like a life sometimes
They don't make sense at all
I was dreaming about an old love
You were lucky I left you
I would have made you miserable
Though it broke your heart and mind
I blew in from somewhere
Don't scattered your life around
I made it a nightmare
But you woke up and I was gone
So, one of my favorite headlines was
Fired for a phallus
Yes, the stage prop that was being used
In our Bacchic performance of the Medea
It was part of the sacking
That the association for university professors
The American Association, the AAUP
Descended on the university and said
Not so fast, you have done wrong
And you have taken a man out
When other professors approached me and said
You're going to be fired
I had no reason to doubt them
But I pressed ahead
I pressed ahead with bringing them that Medea
Can we see the Medea again?
Do we have her image?
Yes, this is actually one of my students
And she was the inspiration of the play
And after my sacking
Which, as you know, behind the scenes
Involved an official inquiry by the Catholic church
Into my state of demon possession
And whether or not I was opening oracles
Portals
Yeah, through oracles
Yeah, fantastic
So, that's where I'm coming from
And it was my honor and duty to the muse
To be able to serve in that capacity
To be able to take students
We had great success with our programs
With people who enter classics
Just because of the work that I was doing
And all I was doing was showing these texts
Was opening up this avenue to these texts
And so what happens to a person
After they are fired from a university
They end up in a very tricky situation
That brought me ultimately to the base
Of the largest constantly occupied
The oldest constantly occupied city on the planet
Excuse me
On our continent
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Anyway, it's a necromanic center of village
