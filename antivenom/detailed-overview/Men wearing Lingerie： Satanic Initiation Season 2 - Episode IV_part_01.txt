And that's how I came to this desert
I landed here after my termination from the university
I landed here
Much to the chagrin of my students
And there's a whole...
You can see from the headlines
It landed our university in the top ten bad universities
For free speech
And these are...
It's not a distinction that they wanted to earn
But at the same time
When you point a phallus
When you point a phallus at someone
It brings something from the ancient world
Into the modern
By means of magic
All these texts are always talking about
Bringing the future and the past into the present
It's the art of the magrus
To be able to do that
It is magic itself
So bringing that power back into the present
Is something that I thought was the goal
And so that's how I oriented my programs and teaching
The student that you see...
Bring her up again, please
That's such a...
I'm so proud
This method actress
Who thrilled on the stage
And everybody said this was the best thing
That this university has ever produced
Full houses every night
Sold out the counters at the seminary
Off the charts for dirty internet web...
Internet traffic
You know that you hit on
When you get stats like that back
Anyway, I'm so proud of what she was able to do
She was able to bring that lady Babylon
She was able to, at that very time
When those fallacies were pointed at the audience
And when we brought them the fury
You could hear it crackle in the air
You could feel it within the audience
When we brought them the figure of that fury back
And said, your greed stains your soul
With a stench of ruin
That's when we had the victory
The students saw it and the students knew it
So when I was fired
It was upsetting to a lot of people
Because what you're doing is you're cutting off
The very source that you claim
You're a museum, you're supposed to be
You're supposed to have access to this information
Well, that student wrote me
She graduated and she went on to act
Started her acting career
And she gave me a note
That I have to this day in my jacket pocket
People want to know my motivations
And what makes me want to do what I do
Her note said, dear Dr. Hillman
You have shown me more of Christianity
Than any of my priests could ever do
Thank you for the education
And I thought, yeah, that's why
That's why you do it right there
Yep
So for those of you who are going to be
Coming to this class tomorrow
What I'm offering
What I'm offering to you is
A hardcore preparation
For intermediate level reading of ancient Greek
This is your hardcore intensive beginner course
I will be more of a drill instructor
Than anything to you and you will get tired
And you will complain that your muscles hurt
And I had just had somebody in for the first time
And he told me after a
Workout he said I didn't think it was going to be so tough
Right?
Yeah, because that's how you have to be able to burn through
What is piled up over that strength
That inner strength
You have to forge ahead with that
And that's what I'm here to do is to show you
You can see what happened in my situation
You can see what happened
And you can know
That I was not going to back down
That I was going to bring the authenticity
I was going to bring the news
Right?
And I wasn't going to back down
There should be no censorship
Despite what you may take
What you may be willing to endure
You should not be willing to endure
