The rape of the muse
Now having said that
We have an issue to deal with
And that is there have been
Cersei has reported to me
That there have been issues with misogyny
On this site of all places
For misogyny to be
Where we study and venerate a woman
We study and venerate a woman
If you want to say we worship femininity
Well, what kind of misogynists would be welcome
Yeah, if we're going to follow the oracles
And if we're going to look at that media
Because the real history is way more interesting
Than what you're being given
What I'm given
The real history is way more interesting
When you get down into those texts
And you know that
You people know that
That's why you want to come tomorrow
Right?
The ones of you that want to take that route
I'm offering you a specialty here
I am Ronan
You can see that from the video
I'm on the outside
Great job
Got a lot of attention
People said this is real potential here
And these theories, right?
These theories are going to change things
Yeah, yeah
And all I was doing was giving them evidence
Hey, you guys
There's a whole bunch of drug books
These people are all on drugs, right?
And they're using it
But giving their infants opiates
Right?
All the time
Why?
Oh, watch
Slows down your bowels, right?
Get a little diarrhea
And take some opium
Feel better, get some sleep
You know, this is part of our culture
That's all I was giving them
Those were the theories
The things that they said were theories
That's what
And it's catching up to them
It's catching up to them
The place that we have to go now
Is we have to say, okay
We've started the magic
I see the pact
I know what direction this is going
I understand now that I am in an implicit agreement
And I will know consciously
When pieces of this agreement
Including what I need to do
Are provided, are given
And one of those things
Is this clothing thing
Next, two weeks from now
We will have a fight club
Yeah
It's the
Get your outfits on
Fight club
Neil will be the champion
That one challenger will be able to
To challenge
Yeah
Now, here's the setting
We are following a Saturnian initiation
In order to do that authentically
You must follow the Roman legionaries
Yeah, isn't that neat?
This is preserved with them
It only makes sense
It's always the officer corps
Who's involved in these aristocratic types of goings on
We want that Bacchic
We want that common democratic Bacchic worship
Yeah
We want that Bacchic fever
We want that Minatic feminine religion
So, we follow the greatest Greek manly hero that ever lived
And that is Heracles
Heracles was remanded to the custody of a queen
By the oracle
Yeah, by the oracle
By the oracle herself
So, this is pretty serious sentence
And it is there that he develops the understanding
Of the queen's lingerie
Now, some of you are delving into the sources now
