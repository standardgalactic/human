Heracles is going to show up
Confident and strong
As the object of sexual desire
As the look of the gaze
Yes, you won't let it faze you
You'll stand up
You're secure enough
To stand up
To feel the gaze
And to stand up
You'll embrace the lingerie
And embrace it
I know I will
I had this
Since we're talking about me
And let's just keep talking about me
When I was in Israel
People have asked me
Well, if you're helping us
To go through this
Why have you done this before?
Very organically
My initiation happened
When I was in Israel
And the people in bed
Were sitting up and telling me things
And then running off the next day
Crazy like
When I was there
A group of women
Descended upon me
I don't know, it's probably eight
Yeah, and they took me back
To their dwelling place
Yeah, and they stripped me
Of my clothing
It was
The locals were celebrating a festival
This is near Armageddon
Tel Megiddo, anyway
The locals were celebrating
A religious festival
So it was time to go out and dance
They stripped me naked
And reassembled
My clothing
With the kit of a minad
Yes, they did
They gave me just a gorgeous dress
And took me out
As if
We were one big drunken troop
And the dancing
Oh, the dancing was spectacular
The dancing was spectacular
I ended up in the end
Running like most do
From the Balkans
I ended up, you know, running back
I found I was safe, don't worry
Everything was fine
But in the process
Of that initiation
I realized that I had a tool
Against every misogynistic impulse
That I would ever have
Yes, you see why you need the Balkans
You see why you need the minads
Tell me Charles, Charles
You're telling me about Hippolyta
And her innocence
Can you tell me about
What's the name of your next poem?
It's Condemned Women
It's Condemned Women, that's interesting
The two good sisters
Wow, that's another one
Can you tell me something a little bit
A little bit darker or deeper?
You could tell me about the fountain of blood
You could tell me that
You could tell me about the allegory
Can I read the allegory?
Picture a beauty
Shoulders rich and fine
Letting her long hair trail
Into her wine
Talons of love
The poisoned tooth of sin
Slip and are doled
Against her granite skin
She laughs at death
And flouts debauchery
Those fiends who in their heavy pleasantries
Gouge and destroy
Still keep a strange regard for majesty
Her body strong and hard
A goddess
Her eyes call mortal beings
To the charms of ready breasts
Between her open arms
