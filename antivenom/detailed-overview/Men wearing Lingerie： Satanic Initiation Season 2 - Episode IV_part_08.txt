We have to
Isn't it rational that
We have to enter into the state?
I mean, so many medicine men
Native American medicine men
Can't be that wrong
There's something about the necromancy here
That we're trying to bring out
And so I invite people
And I'm inviting people now
And I wanted people to see Rob tonight
Because Rob is as genuine
And as transparent as you can get
Of a human being
He's not trying to hide anything
Right?
He's a lover of the muse
And he will follow her
And I know that for a fact
He'll follow her
And he is having a difficult time
Yep
Considering the options, yes
Right?
So, um, yeah
I am
I'm sorry, you're right, yeah
And the way it goes for me is
If this is supposed to be
My path and my way then
I'll find out
I'll be shown
There'll be something
There'll be a signal or a sign
Or something that I'll recognise and follow
At the minute, I'm just frightened
I'm sure I'm not alone
I'm sure I'm not alone in that
And I'm sure there's many, many
Many who are ready to express themselves
And you've got me full support
Complete and full support
Me, I've got...
I'm like that
Whether you teach or learn, you know
It's, um, it's something I'll have to
See what happens with
So for our...
Our judge will be Cersei
Our judge will be Cersei
In one aspect
I will call the round
And Cersei will judge for the sake of prizes
And she will do so
By pulling the audience
By pulling the audience
So we will have your...
Your, um...
When you become a magus
And you step up
And you're wearing the...
You're wearing your feminine kit
And you're drawing that attention
When you become that magus
You will then have the capacity
To enter into the ecstasy
You will be at the point
That your mind is primed
For what the right can deliver
It's, again, it's not my rules
It's just from the past
It's just these texts
That are telling us this
Okay, not many detectives
Go to the crime scene
And put on the killer's pants
Right, not many of them
Go through and stick their finger
Into the bullet wound
Right, but that's
Because they wouldn't want to contaminate it with DNA
But that's what we need to do
We need to get down
We need to get down to the very basis
Of what these texts are talking about
In order to get there, Rob
I have to put on the kit
I have to be in that state
From the throne
Now, you will have evangelicals
Who will hear that
And who will readily understand
That we are following the way of Cain
Right, and aren't we then
Aren't we then preparing the place
For Lady Babylon?
Yes, right, yes
If you can get over
And this is the funny thing
I started this process
And I tell you what
