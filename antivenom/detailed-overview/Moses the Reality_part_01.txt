This is a tool.
Remember you doctors, when you go to work, what is your symbol?
It is this thing with a serpent wrapped around it.
Oh, you mean this thing is medical?
Yes.
Yes.
And remember, please, remember, please that there are ways to
introduce drugs to the human body and the ancient world.
And one of them is on board a thing that you and I today, the
proper terminology would be something like medicated dildo.
And so here we have it.
Here we have it.
Who uses these things?
Back to the, back to the Cersei bit.
Yes.
Love it.
People, look at this.
That's in the Odyssey.
That's in the Odyssey.
Let's float a little bit.
Look, the thing which Athena touched Odysseus seriously,
seriously.
Did you know that Athena was touching Odysseus?
She touched him with her golden rub done.
And what happens when you touch Odysseus with your golden rub done?
He looks younger.
He looks younger.
Yeah.
You remember the Imperial theory acts.
Yeah.
What do you think that technology was developed?
Right.
Oh God.
This is lovely.
Okay.
Let's bring back the text.
That's too much.
That got a little bit too seasoned.
Too much seasoning.
Look what Athena did.
This is her golden rub done that she's going to be applying to Odysseus.
Yeah.
That verb there.
It means that she's applying it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She is covering it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She is covering it.
Yeah.
She is doing it.
She's doing that mistress of the arts, the medical arts thing.
Go.
And what else can you do with a rub done like the one Moses has got in antiquity?
What can you do with one in the third century especially?
Tell us.
Tell us.
Bring us to the third century.
Look.
Look at Hermes.
Lift it up.
His rub done the one that he uses to fel go your eyes to fel go your eyes.
Yes.
He uses it to fel go you.
What is that?
That's when somebody takes over your mind.
Have you ever had somebody take over your mind and introduce thoughts?
And you say that sounds quite crazy and somewhat ridiculous.
Well, it turns out Manfred, whenever they have drug parties of this magnitude and excellence,
that there is a little bit of programming that can be done.
Fantastic.
You know how long you can keep somebody in a cage?
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Is this the Bronze Age?
Yeah.
It's the time that they're figuring out when all of these dotes and antidotes will work
with and against each other.
Right.
So, yeah.
Good.
Remember master formula kind of stuff.
Go to the back to this one.
Look, who is it?
Who is it?
Who's got the thing?
It's Hermes, right?
It's the Angulos.
Remember the text tells us that Moses was visited by an Angulos in that bush that burned.
He was visited.
Where was that Angulos?
Within the flocks.
Within the flocks, plus.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Are you beginning to see what that Angulos does?
Are you beginning to see it?
Look at Moses, everybody.
We all got off the timeship so fast.
We asked, you know, here it is.
Were you surprised that Moses is heavy, heavy, heavy into drugs?
Are you surprised?
Yeah.
Not only that, he's into the good ones.
Watch what he's about to do.
This guy is a tripper.
