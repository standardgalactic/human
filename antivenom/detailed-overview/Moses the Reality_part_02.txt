He is a tripper out there.
And I wanted you to see this because I want you to put Moses and Jesus right next to each
other.
And remember, I'm going to ask you how much time separates Moses from Jesus?
Well, in the fairy tale world, it's a thousand or so years.
In history, it's only about 250 to 300 years.
Separates the two.
Right?
Moses as a creation of the third century, as a knockoff of Museus.
Right?
This character is already established.
This prophet is already there.
Why do you think there are songs of Moses?
Right?
We are working from a third century environment.
So what we are seeing in the third century is being sucked into our fabrication.
Did he just call the Old Testament a fabrication?
Yes, he did.
He did in a poorly done translation.
Oh, God.
What happened to the scholars?
His brain drain or something?
I don't know.
The grammarians usually have their stuff together.
So let's stick with them.
Let's stick with those Greek grammarians and see what they record in all of us.
Okay.
Give me the next one.
What is the...
What is the rabdon on the Hebrew side?
Surely this is the source.
Wait a minute.
A staff?
This is the mate.
And what is this?
A staff, a raw chef, a branch, and then metaphorically a tribe?
Okay.
There's not.
Does everybody see how the depth we've gone now from the depths to the kiddie pool?
We're now at the shallow end, right?
With the kids and their diapers are in the pool.
Did you ever get in the pool with a kid with his diaper on?
Oh, God.
Let me tell you something.
I never did that with my kids ever.
Never would I take a...
Put a kid in a diaper in a pool.
That's so gross.
Okay.
Okay.
That's okay.
Stop.
Where's the whips for such things?
Ryan, that's bad.
That's bad.
Paternal.
Be good with your parenting parents.
Public service message.
If your kids in a diaper, don't take them swimming.
Oh, God.
Why does that make me so mad?
I don't know.
Let's go to the next one.
It's just...
The yahoo gets me pumped.
Okay.
Look, so what happens?
Whoops.
We need to go back to the previous text, Chewie.
I'm sorry.
What happens?
Nope.
One more.
That's the...
Boom.
Yeah.
What else does the ongelos that comes out of the bush, out of that pure, out of that
flocks, that lightning, that uranium power, right?
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, it's because you haven't seen them do it,
right?
You haven't seen them do the right.
Don't worry.
You catch up.
But here's the angel.
And what's the angel saying?
They not only take control of your eyes, but what do they do?
They raise those who are sleeping.
Yeah.
They resurrect those who are sleeping.
Yes.
Now you know why the discussion...
Gosh, I bring the Greek to people.
The more people say, oh, that makes more sense.
That makes more sense that that's how they're...
Right.
The fairy tale actually doesn't make sense, right?
It's the...
And you know, that's what the naked kid with Jesus does.
When Jesus was arrested in the public park of Forian with a naked boy screaming, I'm not
a trafficker.
When a swat team took him down, there was no question about what he was actually doing.
That rap that was on that kid's private parts, that naked kid that was on his private parts,
he was siphoning.
Jesus Christ was siphoning a drug through it.
Oh, God, it's horrific.
I know.
And I know that this reality is particularly disturbing.
And you people at Satanic initiation, you love it.
You love exposing it for what it is, right?
Because come on, come here, Jesus.
That's right on his buttocks.
