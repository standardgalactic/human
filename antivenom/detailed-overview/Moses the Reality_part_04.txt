I'm not talking.
I'm not talking Zeus either.
Right?
Zeus is one of many.
Just as almond is the eighth.
And remember, you can always have a rebellion against the gods and you can take that monest, that monest monstrosity and turn it into something.
And turn it into a historical reality like they did under Akhenaten.
And do you know what they did?
They made that one God monstrosity, that monest monstrosity, that as soon as Akhenaten bit it, they broke down all its monuments.
And they said, we're going back to almond.
We're going back to the eighth.
Why was that so critical?
For the sake of all the gods.
Gods like justice.
Why was that so critical?
Why did that restore what the Egyptians had already had?
It's the same thing that drags down.
It's the same power that drags down classical wisdom.
You cannot mingle classical wisdom and any monest belief.
You can't.
They don't work together.
They will destroy each other or one will get the upper hand.
But somebody's going down.
They cannot coexist.
It is a monstrosity.
Frankenstein.
It's very Frankensteinian.
That's fantastic.
That's not a word.
Go.
That's not what they meant when they said, you must coin so many words.
It's not what they meant.
What did you say?
Remember, he said, ego emi hoon.
Doesn't that sound nice?
Before I tell you what that means,
go to the next one.
Because what could the Hebrew language do with that?
The Hebrew language, just put that verb, I am.
And then who?
Some kind of relative.
And then followed by the same verb again.
I am.
Right?
Okay.
I am who I am.
And that's how it ends up in all of the translations.
That's how it ends up in all of the English translations.
Sounds very Popeye-esque.
Right?
I am what I am.
That is not what the Greek says, as you can see.
Even if you don't know Greek, you can see it's different.
It's not just one word repeated twice.
Remember, when you're going from ancient Hebrew to ancient Greek,
you are stepping up the level of technical difficulty.
Right?
The Hebrew sentence there is a quick run and a jump and maybe a couple of twists.
Right?
The Greek is a lengthy retain.
Look at what they've done with it.
Right?
So I am what I am.
Is the Hebrew side.
Not ready for the actual, the original words of God.
Are you ready?
I am the being.
I am being.
I am being.
Think about the difference there.
I am that I am.
Like gangsta.
Gangsta ya says I am what I am, baby.
Right?
You can see that.
You can respect that.
Right?
What are the judges?
What do we get?
It's a 7.5.
7.5.
Watch the artistic detail.
The technical.
Do you know what the whole on is?
Look at what this is.
First of all, the first thing we have here is ego and ego is a personal pronoun.
You don't have to use that in ancient Greek.
The personal pronouns are used for emphasis, ownership.
Right?
It's not just something being done.
I'm the one doing it.
Me.
You know what he says?
He says I am ha on.
Who is he saying he is?
He says he is the one.
We get a definite article ha and then we get on the participle.
The one being.
I am the being.
I am the act itself of existence.
Which if you think about it has a kind of a much larger reach.
Then whatever I am baby.
Right?
Gangsta.
Gangsta.
Yeah.
It's a little bit over the top that way.
Right?
Very tribal.
Has a very tribal taste to it.
You know, and the level of technology is a little bit lower.
