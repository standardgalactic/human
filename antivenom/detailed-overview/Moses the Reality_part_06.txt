We've been there.
We've seen them.
Look them up.
Look them up.
And there we are.
Okay.
So what is my Ionic name?
If you can remember the last passage, we looked at Livy with the, oh, I'm sorry.
That was a slip.
The Impress.
Right.
We're talking about the Impress.
Anyway, this is my Ionic name.
This is my Ionian name.
What is the Ionian thing then?
What is that?
Pray tell me.
Amen.
Amen hotel.
Where is that guy?
He changed his name.
By the way, Tutank Amon changed his name from Tutank Aten because of the whole way that
monotheism dragged the Egyptians into the dirt.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
So what is that Ionian go down?
I think it's this one.
Yep.
Boom.
This word, Ion, we are here with Ion.
What are we doing with Ion?
We are mourning.
We are mourning.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Does anybody, does anybody smell Adonis?
Yes.
Yes.
Now you know why we have to take the name Adonis and we have to say no.
This is not actually Greek or Blaschian, but it's blah, blah, blah.
And we have to come up with our own roots.
That's what we're doing.
When we back translate, when we create a text, the one we're going to claim is a translation,
right?
That's what we have to do.
That's the tools that we have to work with.
It's like you're working from your own prison, so to speak.
You've painted yourself into a corner linguistically.
This is what we have to do.
What is the Ion?
What is it really coming from?
Right?
If it's not meaning this always and for all time, it's the groan that we have.
It's the mourning that we have for Adonis.
It's the mourning that we have for Adonis.
It is our shout.
Look at that first line at the end.
It says to cry Ii.
To cry Ii.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tell me what it means to cry Ii.
Hit the next one.
What does that mean?
Nancy, I hope this strikes a chord with you.
Look, what is this Ia thing?
Well, it's an epic form.
It's used for Gaia.
It's used for Gaia.
Look at that first line in Greek.
It's so beautiful.
Fusizos Ia.
Who is Ia?
Ia is she who is the nature living.
Literally, it says the living nature.
Ia is living nature.
Now, look here at the bottom, number two.
Look here at number two.
And what does it say?
It's originally the name of Colchis.
Colchis.
And what do you mean?
What is Colchis?
Colchis is a city and it is also the name of a woman.
Yes.
And Colchis is equivalent with a very dystopic switching of constants.
One of them jumps in front of the other one.
It's like that.
But you look at the Victorians.
If you don't believe me, go to Alice in Wonderland.
Look at the Victorians and see what they say about Colchis.
What is Colchis?
It's not only the name of Medea.
It is also the name of the purple.
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
It's the name of the purple.
All of this cult that we have tried to cut away the false Hebrew to look at the original Greek.
All of this cult has led us right back to that original mystery.
This is the reason that Medea's students, the Magi, came after Jesus.
They saw his star.
Now do you know what it means?
Yeah.
Jesus.
By the way, I want you as we're thinking about Moses entering into these drug rights.
Remember the Egyptians catch up?
The Egyptians catch up.
They do the same thing.
The very same thing.
They make that dracon.
Why?
