I'm taking my last ride I paid the highest price you can pay
I'm on my way to Potter's Field The Palmer's Grave is where I'll be
To rest until the end of time For all eternity
Welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
It's so nice to have you aboard tonight Let me tell you what we're going to do
We've got some real, real sexy material
I mean this is the kind of cult stuff that earns the name cult
What I'm going to do is I'm not going to take you back to any sort of scholar
Any sort of academic I'm not going to give you an argument
All I'm going to do is show you a source I'm going to show you several
And these sources tonight we have to dust off the shelf
Out of that book pail, that scroll And we've got to blow it off
Here it is people This is Uncensored Tonight on Lady Babylon
Tonight we're all here for one reason That's because as we're building our case
Against Jesus who was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy
Fastest ever As we're building our case
Trying to explain what his motive and his motivations were
We've got to really have what I call corroborating evidence on a trans-dimensional plane
This is corroborating evidence What is going on in the cult today
If you and I could get into a space time ship and go back and see it
We'd be in the best circumstances and it just so happens that we have dug up a spirit
Now tonight I'm not going to give you a spirit's name
I'm not, but I'm going to tell you that this Greek hasn't been English since 1860 something
And Dr. King who Englished it
Well, he did a sufficient job
But this thing has been laying in a collection
It's been laying in a collection of works that were assembled
We're going to stop the door real quick on the ship, hop out, I want you to hop out in the 1920s
Okay, I'm sorry, I know you guys like to date to be all the way out in antiquity
But tonight we're going to stop by and pick up a couple of Germans
So in they come, in they come, yeah, make room for them
Otto Kern, student of Hermann Deals, two of the greatest compilers and editors of classical texts
These are the guys who did all of the medicine, oh my god, the pharmacological stuff
All the stuff on venoms and all the cult stuff, they assembled, one of them assembled, right?
Otto, tell me Otto, what is, tell me Otto, what, what's the secret?
There's a what? A code, a code called the Orphic Vox
That's interesting, yeah, the Vox Orphica, isn't that nice?
This is one of those bits that is oftentimes ignored for centuries
Yeah, for centuries, and now we're going to dig it up tonight
And I'm going to let you see that, and I'm going to translate it for you
And I'm going to show you a little bit of a translation because I know, I know people will not believe me about this
I'm going to make an assertion now that someone is going to step forward
I can see this person with my mind's eye, I can see who they are, they're short, they're short
They have a complex, I can feel the bad vibe in them
I smell a church pew, I smell a church pew, and this person is going to come up
He's going to say, you don't have these choices
Okay, for those people, what I'm giving you tonight are the sources, and I'm sorry congregation
I'm sorry, I know you're there already, right? Sitting very stoically listening
Let's get to the goodies, shall we? This is from Otto Kern's collection
And I want to show you a couple of, well, I'll let him speak for himself
Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation of Lady Babylon
Welcome to Hermes
Welcome to Hermes
Welcome to Hermes
Welcome to Hermes
You see that snake on the rod? That's your salvation
This is the basis of the religions that you now follow
And this cult has deep roots
Tonight we're going to the Pantocrator, that one who has all the power
We're coming to the angel, I'm bringing you an angel tonight
How does this book of this nameless author open up? I want you to know, we can't hear it
So I'm going to have to tune a little bit here
It's in Dactylic Hexameter, it's in a meter
It's a song, it's a song
And what is the song? How does the song begin? The song begins with Hermes
