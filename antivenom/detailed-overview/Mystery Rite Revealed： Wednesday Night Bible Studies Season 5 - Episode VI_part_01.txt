And Hermes, the son of Maya, has come to bring to you the good news
To those who have good hearts and discrete minds
To those I offer the ambrosial gifts
In this my cave, you will find the advantages of all life
This is not for those who are foolish, who live their lives in ignorance
This is for those who hear and obey the gods
Fantastic, fantastic, okay are you ready? So you hear it, you hear the calling
Those of you with years to hear, you hear the calling, let's get to it
Let's get to it, where are we going? I want to pull us up a text, I want to hit us with a text
Where does this come from? After Hermes begins to speak to reveal it
Yeah, this golden rod, what does he do? He bids us on this richly beautiful earth
To live, taking delight in never having anything to do with the ugly
Whichever of you people out there, whichever ones of you are spurred on by a heart that is inspired
You will go to the cave of Hermes
That place is the sacred virgin
Love it, love it, love it, what has he put there Hermes for us?
Well he says he's put there for us these advantages, these things that are going to bring us vision
Alright, so that we may flee from that mourning for misery of existence that ends in death
That we may go from the mortality to the immortality by this communion
Now, you know what we're doing? We're tracking Jesus, right? We're tracking Jesus
We've come to the garden with Jesus, we've come to Gethsemane
We're about to take a look inside, we're about to see what he could be doing as Pantokrator
Yes, I am Jesus says Jesus, the Amen, the Pantokrator
Everybody said he would be coming in the Septuagint
Why? They were using Greek terms in the Septuagint? Yeah, because it's not a translation
We all know that now, we're going forward
It's not a translation, it's highly, highly technical Greek, Hellenistic Greek
It's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, if you haven't had some, you should lick it up, lick it up
It's got this in there, woo, love it, it's getting me excited
It's hard to tell, you know what really makes me excited?
It's figuring out where these works originated
That's the fun part, you know, that's what the people, the German scholars, those brilliant German scholars are digging up and putting back together
The esoteric baby, you're not going to find this elsewhere, because I don't want to sell it
Yeah, remember that everyone, this channel is not monetized, it's contractual, can't keep it going
Those of you with the hearts that are inspired understand, we can't keep it going if we take any money for it
Yes
So, let's proceed then, with Hermes, please tell us, tell us so, angel, right? Everybody realize, he's the angel in the room
Thank you, let's go, hit it, yes, no, let's go down to the next one, please
Yeah, I want to give you this, I just want you to read, look, because nobody, a little voice in my head this morning said, hey, try to shock him
And I said, I can't shock him, I can't shock him, because whatever I say, somebody comes along and says, you don't need your sources, you don't need your sources
Yes, okay, it's what we're doing the whole time, the whole time, it's all we're doing, focusing on Jesus, remember, we're investigating here, we're focusing on Jesus and what he's doing
They're drugs that they're taking, people please understand me, they're getting totally wasted on stuff, totally wasted on stuff
It's causing them to see things, to act very, very strange, into the psychotic realm
Yeah, yep, so, hold on here, let's see what these Christs are up to
I just want to read this to you, but strange, it's influence on the human brain
I'm telling you, drugs, people, watch for the drugs, nor can the rest disguise his hidden pain, from whom the dire disease, sorry
We seek to purge, sent down from heaven, the human race, discourage
He likes his rhymes, thank you, Dr. King
Soon as his nostrils feel the potent smoke, I told you, I told you, I told you they were getting high, ten years ago, I told you they were getting high
And nobody listened, now the guy who critiques me is turning around and writing a book about it, making money off it
Oh, it's funny, it's like, you know, you know what it is, goes on the hook, who knows better, who knows better than the devil what goes on the hook
You can put a little bit of reputation or a coin on that day, those humans will take it all the time, right?
He's beautiful, isn't he, he's the best looking, those angels that were just talking, he's the best looking, I love it
Soon as his nostrils feel the potent smoke, Hail Satan, throne of Asteria
Soon as his nostrils feel the potent smoke, headlong he falls as from the lightning stroke, covered with foam and fierce convulsions bound
He rolls and writhes and struggles on the ground
Hey, this is a, this is a time, this is a good time, okay, I don't know what you think, what your morals are, what your values are, but this is a good time, this is a good time
Okay, bring it back up, same one, oh my goodness
He rolls and writhes and struggles, malignant Luna, oh come on man, you know what doesn't say that
Tyrant of his brain surveys his torture and enjoys his pain
Okay, now I'm getting a little bit, it's getting a little bit hot in here, we need to, we need to tone it down a little bit, I'm just getting a little bit
I'm starting to feel it, are you starting to feel it, if we had the Aerotoxin, you'd be able to visualize, you'd be able to visualize that Daimon
Come on, can you see Aphrodite, can you see Desire, right, what do the Bakhans do, they do everything they do to visualize these entities
Fascinating, two worlds affixed upon each other, one visible, one not, fantastic
Wonderful, let's go, okay, magic, this is Jesus, we're still hanging in there with Jesus, right
