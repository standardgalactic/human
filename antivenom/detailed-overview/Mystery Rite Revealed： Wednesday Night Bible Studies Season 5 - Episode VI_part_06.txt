Let's see what kind of stuff is going on.
How do we get to virgins?
This is crazy tonight.
If you think this is crazy, write something in, because,
okay, look, I'm doing the best I can to bring this to you
in the most educated way possible.
Are you ready?
Oh, my goodness.
But it makes it so hard.
What are these things, the atheoi?
Those are those virgin boys.
And what are they there?
What does that mean?
Oh, that's tender flash, baby.
The tender flash boys.
What are they there?
You can see the word hormone on that second line.
Yeah, see the Horme?
These are hormone driven.
These people who are in the mode.
You'll see the girls in a second.
It's a little bit scary what they're giving them.
They're giving them aphrodisiacs.
They say it.
All of this is to lead you to Aphrodite.
You will be seeing her.
Isn't that fantastic?
Okay.
All right.
I think I get it.
You hear the idolatry?
Now you'll know why the great Victorian stuff shirt said,
hey, this word is either idolatry or it's fornication.
Yeah, we can't tell the difference, right?
Oh, my.
I heard some protest that in England somewhere,
I heard their face just crack at that, just shatter.
I love that.
What are we doing here?
Pull that dirty thing up again, that last one.
Pull that thing up.
Let's just bring it to them.
This is enough.
This is enough.
Look, I've taken your time.
Let me just present the evidence.
What is it?
What happens to those boys?
They charge up to this Christ.
What do they do?
They bring the surrounding in the palm.
They do.
Wait.
What?
They like to wrap something up in their palm with him in their hemeritacy.
Oh, no, that's not good.
That's not good.
That means sexual desires.
Oh, my God, humorous is, you know, it makes sense that humorous is here
because humorous accompanies Aphrodite everywhere she goes.
And you say, pull that down.
I want to give them a quick Aphrodite effect.
For those of you who are trying to portray Aphrodite, please, please, please.
She is not the most beautiful goddess.
Everybody knows who obeys and is persuaded by the gods knows that Hera is the most beautiful.
