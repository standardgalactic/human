This was that.
Yeah.
Notice that where is where is really that power that powers in the holo that powers in
that holey or that that bitterness that bite that solution that is so accurate.
Yes, that biting solution is really where this is coming from.
And we know that holey is also a poison from a serpent, particularly the one that you and
I go out and put on the pole and we watch that servant of the muse.
I don't care if you call him Moses.
We watch that servant of the muse bring the voice of God.
Yeah.
Here he is tonight.
Here he is tonight.
Let's go down to the last.
I think I have one more.
Yep.
This is this is sort of long.
So let me just summarize because I know everybody is tired.
But there's a woman in this.
I just want to tell you about the top lines.
A barbara ace.
A barbara ace.
Yeah.
And who is she?
She's this guy's mother who's talking.
And what does she do?
She knew a whole bunch of stuff about curing disease.
Yeah.
And her son is going to sing about this thing.
This noble.
Oh fight.
This noble drug of the serpent, the noble drug of the servant.
Are you ready?
You haven't.
You're your ears cannot be worthy.
Right.
None of us can sit here and receive this information without being completely humbled.
You're about to see the venom communion.
Yeah.
You mean the blood contains the venom.
Yep.
Yep.
That's why that golden bed is necessary.
Do you see why Jesus had to have a naked boy with him in a garden at four a.m. when he
was taking the cup of God as Cosmo.
Do you see that?
Do you see that?
Wow.
Okay.
I think we've got some.
I think we've got tightened up a little bit to see what Jesus is there doing with these
sexually aroused children.
Right.
And so it turns out that Jesus wasn't just arrested in a public park at four a.m. with
a naked boy screaming, I'm not a child trafficker.
It turns out Jesus was arrested in a public park at four a.m. with a naked boy that was
high on sex drugs.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Thank you for meeting Mercury.
Hail Satan.
For all eternity, my whole mother won't know where I am.
