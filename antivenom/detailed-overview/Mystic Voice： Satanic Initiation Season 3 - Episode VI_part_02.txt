What is he doing?
He has that thrice helix image of the ram's horn.
He is Hesperian Zeus and he prophesies or tells the words of prophecy.
Yeah. With that time breaking oracular voice. I said we're going to be talking about voice tonight.
The real topic here is voice. Subliminally, we'll be kicking this over to you.
How does one use the mystic voice? How does one use that? Why don't we just go and look at the uses of the mystic voice?
For that, I'm going to pull up my text and Chewie, if you can hit the next.
There we go. That's big enough. That's fantastic.
Look right at the top. Who are we talking about? We're talking about Typhon.
Who is Typhon? Typhon is a snakey-legged dragon. He is a snakey-legged monster.
He is the earth-born. Remember him this way.
What does he do? He bubbles up this fiery breath of the lightning.
Isn't that nice? He's got a fiery breath of lightning in him.
What does he do? He burns all of the land. The thing goes up and smoke.
The tops of the mountains crumble down in the fire.
When all of this is happening, outsteps a singer, a priest-singer who serves Lydia and Zeus.
He leaves the temple at that awesome smelling place.

You thank the sacrifices.
Tone, holla, holla, holla, right? No, it's not.
It's usually an altar with, did you buy little bricks of incense for?
That's what a burnt offering is.
That verb thuo is almost always.
It's overwhelming majority of the time that I've personally seen it in tax.
It's a reference to a frankincense offering.
Little cakes, little bricks that you put on the barbecue that they got set up inside the tent.
The circus tent where we hear the voice.
And we open our eyes.
Come on to the circus tent.
Did everybody see what was going on?
We only have so much time for this investigation.
