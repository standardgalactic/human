These educated women took an active approach to the cosmos by advancing the notion that the world around them
Particularly the human body could be actively manipulated
They believed they were not just spectators of a cosmic dream
But active participants in the progress of the universe's drama
Ancient witches were part of a long religious and medical tradition that predates written history
They were a bridge between the shaman of early human civilization and the philosopher of the classical era
The earliest written records of Greek, Roman and Etruscan civilization
Are replete with drugs and drug recipes used by priestesses and witches
The witches' understanding of drugs predates the written word
Even the palace records of the Minoans and Mycenaeans
The earliest ancestors of the Greeks to leave written documents
They show an awareness of the use of botanicals as drugs
It's old
You go through this old linear bee and a lot of lists you get are lists for the drugs that they're trading
It's right there, it's gorgeous, you can tell what they're doing
You can tell what they're doing by the drugs
Have you been to Cyprus? Did you get the Smyrna?
You know what that stuff smells like?
Oh god, I can't do this
I can't do this, it gets to me, just sitting here, it gets to me
Witches were never passive
They actively engaged the discipline and subject matter in order to advance their cause
With a clear unified agenda and laborious training in their arts
Ancient witches claimed to be able to harness the power of the natural world to perform supernatural feats
Their miracles were based in the reality of sexuality
As the witch Canidia said in Horace's epodes
With my own voice, I am able to draw down the moon
I can arouse the dead once cremated
I can concoct drugs of sexual desire
They can bring that individual back
Even after they've been, their bodies consumed
It's fantastic, I love this
They can also make the sex drugs
Yeah, fantastic
Makes you wonder about Mary Magdalene, doesn't it?
That Pope
Who cares that she has sex drugs, really?
She needs to be pardoned
Pope Greg the Great
You guys are hilarious, the watchers
They always know the best places in the universe
Witches accomplished the impossible by manipulating the mundane
They secured their environments for the tools necessary
They scoured their environments for the tools necessary to alter the natural world
And they used the act of human sexual intercourse as a springboard to affect their supernatural tinkering
It's fair to say that the heart of ancient witchcraft was sexuality
There's a good reason that so many ancient spells are concerned with intercourse
Witches believed sex was the cosmic magic that gave them their power
Drugs, let's talk about drugs
The desire to bend nature led priestesses of Hecate, Priapus, and Dionysus
To the use of potent plant and animal substances
These chemicals had dramatic effects on human physiology
Powdered aconite was lethal in very small doses
Opium latex from the poppy mixed with the juices of the deadly nightshade plant
Caused benumbed ecstasy
There's one for the biotech people
