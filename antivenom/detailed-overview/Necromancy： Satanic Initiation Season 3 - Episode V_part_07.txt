Chemicals that can be used, you know
Called them elements of the blood
Seeds of fire
Yeah, the seeds of fire
All of a sudden, the evangelical turned on for a minute
Because he was like, what?
Yeah, you start to smell the Christos, don't you?
Yeah, you do
Yeah, we're controlling administration, right?
We're bringing it down to drinking that blood
It's the blood of the sacrifice
When you eject that chemically aborted fetus
With the drug, the burning purple that you're using
That is our communion
Those cells in that concoction are the healing of the nation
Yeah, isn't that great?
Hmm, now you know where you came from
Ancient priestesses and sorcerers
Viewed the underworld as a realm or dimension of the universe
Accessible through cosmic portals
Using their pharmacological crafts
They claim the ability to open these portals
For would-be travelers
They don't care if you can see them or not
And for those brave enough to consult the dead
Wait a minute, isn't Jehovah...
Wait, where's that Jehovah?
Where are you?
Are you here, mighty, mighty Jehovah of the highest?
Where'd you go, Jehovah?
He hates this
He hates this stuff, right?
He's like, don't you go consult these witches
These pharma case, right?
These users of drugs
Do you know why you shouldn't consult them?
They can talk to the dead
And it turns out that it works, right?
Bring this up, bring this up in your church
Say, wait a minute, how is this stuff working?
And it says that they're involving drugs, right?
It's because you as a Christian
Are not practicing Christianity
I don't care if you're a Catholic or a Protestant
I don't care, you are phonies
Phonies
And how do I say that?
Because I've seen
How the early church practiced
And you are nothing of a mystery
You are a fragment of a jaded past
Your faith is not the operation of a mystery
It never was
Yeah, you gotta go back to your texts, people
Evangelicals, where are you in there?
Go back, go back to your texts
