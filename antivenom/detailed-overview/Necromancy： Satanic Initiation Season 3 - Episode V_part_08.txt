Look at them, look at your texts
Yeah, that's what they need to do
Witch of indoor
Yeah, love it
Elijah's doing that stuff too
Elijah's into the drugs, bro
Now he can bring the fire of uranos
He knows what the purple is
It's that
Have you been talking?
Talking to the donkeys, right?
It's not at all difficult to see
Why the bishops of the early Christian church
Move the Roman emperor to declare the activity
Of witches to be illegal
And prosecutable by execution
They're not going to execute twisted sister, are they?
Twisted sister
We're not going to take it
To the great twisted sister
Let us not take it
Yes, let us not take it
The sexual magic of Greco-Roman witches
Presented an impediment to the spread
Of Christian mystery rights
Who they were
An impediment to the spread of Christian rights
These openly condemned communication
With any of the underworld divinities
Church fathers condemned the use of pagan magic
But they could not entirely wipe out the influence
Of witches on the Roman population
Drugs used by witches to treat gynecological problems
Had become an important aspect of ancient medicine
Just as they are today
You see they're fighting about the same thing
Nothing changes
Oh my, it's beautiful, isn't it?
The watchers, again, let me just say something
Watchers, they're like these humans, man
I know they call it the dung heap dimension
They call it the dimension of the refuse
The prison
Some of them call it the prison
And that's where we are
In a giant prison
This is your punishment
Yeah, yeah
This is your punishment
Keep them from their sexual magic
When they put on the clothes of a woman
A woman, dear
The disrespect of a woman
You know what we all need to do now?
We all need to put on the clothes of a woman
Yeah, supporting our twisted sister
