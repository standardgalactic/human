I let that liquor drown my days Now I'm taking my last ride
I paid the highest price you can pay And I'm on my way to Potter's Field
Potter's Grave is where I'll be To rest until the end of time
For all eternity
Welcome back to Lady Babylon.
This is Wednesday Night Bible Studies,
and you are at the final episode of the fifth season.
Tonight I want to bring to you something special to mark the occasion.
I want you to have the prophecy.
I'm going to bring you something from the depths,
bring you something from antiquities spoken by the mouth of the Sybil herself.
Tonight we're going to look into the face of the echidna on Lady Babylon.
In order to begin
with the foundation and root of everything pagan,
that which those who worship the gods worship.
I want to bring you decay tonight.
I want to bring you justice.
And I want to say she is the last.
She is the last of the divinities to abandon mortal society.
If you drive her out, you do so to your own peril.
Now, this is a very, very pagan thing that angered the pagans,
because the Christians and the Jews did not respect the gods.
They were not devotees of decay.
If you are unwilling to offer yourself to justice,
you do not belong as a part of civilized society, say the Romans.
You must honor justice.
Perfect for our circumstances, the time.
Shall we play a little video?
Something that brings the future and the past together into one coherent message.
Chewie, hit it.
It's really about realizing that walking in humility,
surrendering everything to my Heavenly Father,
who ultimately is the one who directs what I do, hopefully each and every day.
