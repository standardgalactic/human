who is this, oh my, the case, who is this face of justice, she is the splendid, shining one,
she is the coming dawn, let's look at the next, let's bring us to the next one, here we go,
look, just look at the Greek here, I'm just, look, I'm throwing sources at you, right,
where are your sources, they're here, dummy, somebody, that's for you, for the person who wrote

imagine you watching, yes, I do, I do, I love it, here we go, look at this,
Udinagar, enthusiasm, there is no enthusiasm, there is no religious awe without the erotic
inspiration, this is a principle, you cannot enter the cave without, if you want into this cave of
initiation, you have to have a tattooed on your skin so you'll remember it, it's a Scythian thing,
lovely, don't tell me the Scythians didn't have any written, never mind, if we have the, if we have the

bring up the source, this ecstasy, this, do you see at the bottom, enthusiasm, this enthusiasm

when Bacchus Ewasas, when Bacchus cries Ewa, he is stung by the madness and at that time
