I let that liquor drown my days Now I'm taking my last ride
I paid the highest price you can pay And I'm on my way to Potter's Field
Potter's Grave is where I'll be To rest until the end of time
For all eternity
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Wednesday Night Bible Study.
So fantastic to have you here tonight.
Tonight we're going to just take a tiny, tiny whack at that fracture in space-time.
We're just going to open it up a little bit.
All a part of our campaign to storm the gates and take back the tax.
That's right, we're taking it back. They belong to us now.
Tonight we're going to raise up a number, a number of profits.
And I know when profits come around and you get baptisms, we're going to start getting dirty.
So there's a little bit of dirty material tonight, fair warning.
We are going to go to that place where we can get the wine of Sodom.
Tonight on Lady Babylon.
Some of you have come here thinking that Christ is the Messiah.
It is not. The terms are not equivalent.
One is a late term, and one is a term that was used for a millennia within mystery religions.
One is a term that was invented to mask for another term.
One is an original. Tonight we're going to sort all that out.
Because remember, when it comes to the Christ, the Christ is not the Messiah.
The Christ is not the Messiah.
The Christ is the Christos.
And tonight you get to see what the Christos is.
I'm going to give you this video. We're going to start out and I'm going to give you this to you twice.
Once in the beginning, once in the end.
Specifically because the images are meant to penetrate.
You are meant to be finding what is behind them. Chewie, hit it.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
The Christos is the Messiah.
