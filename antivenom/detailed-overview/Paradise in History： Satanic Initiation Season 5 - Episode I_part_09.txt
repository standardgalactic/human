Hey, we were here with the drugs and the mystery.
I want for us to be able to perpetuate this thing that we've been doing when we open up
that scene and we see the reality.
So I'm going to keep bringing you these filthy dirty texts from antiquity.
I'm going to read you the real stuff.
A lot of it may make you a little bit queasy.
But that's what it's all about, getting into that murder scene.
That's what it's all about.
We're there with Jesus.
We're there with that naked kid that he was arrested with.
We're going down.
You a sater, Jesus?
You got that stuff on board that gives you the thirst?
Yeah.
I know.
You know what they were doing?
They do this.
They do this because they get itchy, twitchy.
Yeah.
Love it.
Fantastic.
I look forward to seeing you guys Wednesday and thank you for coming back tonight.
I truly appreciate it and I'm going to put a ton of work in this so that I can justify
taking up your precious time.
Thank you again and Hail Satan.
