Get out of the closet
I'm flying for peace, all things hidden will be revealed
I'm Freddy Kruger with the purple stone, Hail Satan!
My juice is home, I'm in the twilight zoning
Roots I cut and grow em, dip up all you token
Take two hits and hold it, the witch she keep you loaded
So good they want my mow it, I spit dragon venom
Through hell and through the heavens, hot fire is purple
I'm with the Ashy Ashman, where the horses ride
Flying through the night, I'm here for the promises
You feel alright, it's a promisey
She keeps it tight, got the costume on
All night, I'm with the fumigation company
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, this is the initiating apocalypse
I thank you for coming tonight and I have a couple of little announcements
We are going, I want people to appreciate Teddy Bass
Thank you Orpheus for the tunes
We have put together, and when I say we, I mean they
They have put together for you a study group
And who is they? These are veterans who have been through the program
These are people who have walked through intensive Greek
And they are going to meet with you on Saturday
On the myth and folklore
Myth and lore, sorry, site that were
On, what's it called? Oh yeah, discord
Which is aptly named
God, you have to be insane to use it
But the veterans there will answer your questions
About those exercises in unit one
How you should feel, should you be having anxiety right now?
That kind of thing, they're there and so far
What I want you to do is I want you to go there
And it is part of your course and you, it is a lab
Here's what I'm thinking, let's try to crash the discord
Chewie, you're going to post that, you're going to post that thing somewhere
It's going to be somewhere, post it now
And Saturday is the day for your lab
Saturday is the day for your lab, sometime
During the semester
As you're working through the course, I want you to stop by on a Saturday
Let's see if we can crash that thing
We have the largest ancient Greek course
In the world, everybody, it's you
We did it, you know what we did, we sent a message to them
We're coming for you, fantastic, fantastic
Let's get into it tonight, I know there's some stuff here
That people want to talk about, we're going to have some comments first
Because believe it or not
I read comments and email
And people send me email and I cannot respond
But I take every piece in my brain and I say
Look at this, look at that, it's like listening to a thousand
Different voices from all over the place
I love it, oh god, keep sending me the email
The good stuff, the bad stuff, the naughty stuff
The proper stuff
Stuff you can read in the privy
Let's do that, let's do that, keep sending it
What about your comments, I want to put a couple of comments
Yes, yes, go to the top first, there we go Chewie
Hit it
Thank you Armin for making me aware
Of this dark alley, I surely would have gotten
You would have, you would have that had gotten you good
But now you're free, you know what I mean?
The blinders are off baby, you can see
We'll be like gods
Knowing good and evil
You want to see tonight some good and evil, I'll show you
It's uncensored, good and evil
Hail the muse, you too buddy, give me the next one
Look at this people, if they don't get Armin to spank this guy
Oh please, anytime I can spank, I'm more, I am more than ready
While showing him the simple Google search
For biblical Hebrew, right, how many words did it have?
Right, do you see where we are?
This is where you get when the dark ages return
This is where you get, it's amazing
You mean people just believe things just to believe them
Even though it's contrary to reason, yes
Watch, oh I have a good one for you, give me the next one
Oh Semiramis by the way, yes Semiramis
Lady Babylon, love it, Armin raffled a lot of feathers
I love it so much, you can tell
You're into the research, trying to learn
And who goes into it, trying to prove a point
Corporal Clegg, you're exactly right
And that is not how the museum is
The museum is there to preserve that sight
To preserve that evidence, to allow you to look at it
And say what were these people doing?
You don't want to go and listen to the dude about the aliens
Oh my God
Oh God, those aliens, it's the ones with the heads, the big heads
We're back, watch this people, what are we doing?
We're dealing with people who are part of a system
And we're getting all sorts of stupidity
Let me tell you something, it's just ideas
Don't worry, don't worry, it's ideas and you can cut right through that
Cut right through that, fantastic
Look what he says on the second line here, wait go back, there we go Chewie
Armin is a role model, thank you, thank you
Yes, for all scholars and he's setting the bar higher
Than any apologist can reach
Do you want to see an apologist?
Let's expose an apologist right now, are you ready for this?
This is about genocide, okay?
This is the child's sacrifice to those who worship
The great destroyer of children
Hit it
No, not that one, oh Chewie look
Oh God, it's the film, hit the film, hit the clip, hit the clip, there it is
The more difficult problem is the children
How could God command that the children be killed because these are innocent
And I think what I would want to say there is that God has the right to give and take life as he sees fit
Children die all the time, every day
People's lives are cut short, God is under no obligation whatsoever to prolong anyone's life another second
So he has the right to give and take life as he chooses
Moreover, if you believe as I do in the salvation of infants or children who die
What that meant was that the death of these children meant their salvation
They were the recipients of an infinite good as a result of their earthly phase of life being terminated
The problem is that people look at this from a naturalistic perspective and think life ends at the grave
But in fact this was the salvation of these children and would be far better for them
Than continuing to be raised, say, in this reprobate Canaanite culture
So I don't think God wronged anybody in commanding this to be done
He didn't wrong the adults because they were deserving of capital punishment
He didn't wrong the children if there were any that were killed which we don't know
Because God has the right to take their lives and in fact they were the recipients of a great good
So I don't think there was anybody that was morally wronged in this affair
So what is happening?
The salvation is the death of the Philistine
The salvation is the death of the child of Canaan
I see, we pray to you Lord Jehovah, we bring you this sacrifice
Now for those of you who were disturbed by that cultic death of the Dark Ages
Look in the forecast, look in the forecast and what's coming
Read, read the signs, yeah that's right
Tonight we're going to go sign reading
I'm going to take you all into the life of the Prophet, the Haruspex
The one who sees the future and I'm going to show you how it's done
I'm going to show you how it's done
And I want you to understand the evidence
I'm not selling you anything
Right, I'm not selling you, everybody out there
Right, F the money
Right, okay here we go, here we go
And by F I mean forget
Here we go, give me that last comment
I want one more because this I thought was important
Look people, this was the first, the scariest
And after that the least scary comment that I've ever received
I'm Christian, fantastic for you Rob, fascinating stuff
Because you used to believe in Jesus, you're going to heaven
That's how awesome God is
I hope to see you there, me too Rob
I hope to see you there in the whole time
I'm going to be pointing at Jesus and I'm going to be saying
Where's the naked kid that you were with when you got arrested
That's what I'm going to be saying
If that's your heaven Rob
If that's your heaven, have at it
Because you know what, I'm going to love doing it there
As much as I'm loving doing it here
Hail Satan, hail Satan, hit it to me everybody in the course
Hail Satan, hail Satan
That's right, one quick note of happy birthday to Jesus
And we're going to hit the sermon, give it to him
Yahoo, yahoo, when's your birthday?
Everybody, happy birthday to yahoo
Happy birthday to yahoo
Happy birthday Elohim Hashem Jehovah
It was in the third century
Great, now we've purged, right?
Now we're going to step out of the capsule
We've gone back in time
And where I've taken it tonight is we're going to sneak in
We saw a little bit of Paul last time
But now we're going to wait
We're going to watch Paul as he's walking around
