This is Saint Paul, we're going to see
What is this guy doing?
We know he just got high
He went to that third heaven and he had his apocalypse
Now what are we going to do?
We're going to look at who he's going to associate with
We're going to look at their relationships
And we're going to look at what they're doing
Paul is going to give you the biggest key
To understanding the ancient mystery
And nobody has seen it before now
Let's do it, let's do it, hit it, boom
Hit me with it, people, what is this text?
It's the letter, it's the letter right to Philemon
And it says, hey, it's Paul here
And you remember me, I'm the prisoner of Jesus Christ
Oh, and here's my buddy, Timmy
Timmy's my buddy
And who am I writing this to?
I'm writing this to Philemon, right?
I'm writing it to the, he's such a great guy
And he's all jazzed up and he's working with us
And his sister, Opthia, right?
Oh, and who's that guy? Who else are we writing to?
Oh, Archipus, who's he?
He's a fellow soldier, baby, he's got your back
Along with all the people that meet with you guys
When you meet
Hello to everybody, that's the beginning of the letter
Now, who is this kid, Timothy, that Paul is with?
People don't realize it because you see St. Timothy
Oh, whoo, right, and he's got, ha, le, ha
No, no, give me the next one
Um, don't let him, Tim
This is Paul talking to Tim
Timmy, come here
Don't let them look down on you
Because you're so young
Give me the next one
Don't let them look down on you, little guy
How old is Timmy when he's working with Paul?
He's a teenager
And that is not unusual
They're taking these kids with them everywhere
On all the missionary journeys
They're taking them
Jesus can't go anywhere without 12 of them
Following him
Am I gonna show you the lace days tonight?
Oh, I am, I'm just keep rubbing this baby in
I'm just rubbing it, rubbing it, rubbing it
It'll absorb
And when it does, it's gonna burn
Let's do it, give me the next text, here we go
So back to Philemon
What does he say? Okay, ready?
Now, um, now's the time for those of you who are squeamish
Just step to the back
Okay, get your bags out
You don't want any splashing?
Let's, what does Paul say?
This is for your koinonia
Your koinonia
The koinonia of your faith
Paul says I want it to be energetic
I want it to be engaged
In the knowledge of everything
Good in you
By means of the Christing
Okay, remember, these are cultists
These are mystery cultists
And the power of the Christing is a big deal
We're about to see, you're about to get to see
The relationship that is at the middle of Christianity
And Judaism
Wow, let's do it
Give me the next one, here we go
We're gonna get in deep, are you ready?
What do you mean? You want this thing to be energetic
You want it to be active
Like what do you mean?
Like a medicine or a drug
You mean this is a medical drug?
Everybody, duck tails, Dan, close your ears
They're using medical terms
Oh God, that felt good for some reason
And I'm not usually, you know
Usually gets my goat to have to deal with that right away
Oh, here we are
Penelope, we love you, we're bringing you on early
Please show everyone who's come tonight
What the cross hides
Please, thank you Penelope
Get some sleep, sweetie
Alright, let's go to the next one
Boom
What is it that Paul wants to encourage the development of?
He wants to encourage the development of Koinonia
And Christians will run around and say
Oh yes, let's go to my kind of new club
Right, what is it?
It's an association or a partnership
If you look down this thing, you'll find out
It has to do with marriage, human society
Give me the next one, please
Chewie, boom
And what?
Sexual intercourse
Does that say sexual intercourse?
Sexual intercourse?
Bacchus
Look, he's right here, the God's right here
Yay, it's the mystery
And what's that saying in Greek?
It says the Koinonia is something that you enter into
Right, what are you entering into it for?
For the sake of the beauty of the right
And who's it with?
It's with a Kunikos
It's with a Kunikos
Okay, wait
So this fellowship of the mystery
I'm starting to smell something
Did somebody leave their underpants somewhere?
I think historically somebody has left their underpants
And we are about to find them
Are you ready for historical underpants?
Give me the next one, please
Go for it
People, I told myself today
I was like, you gotta get these people jazzed up
With the dirtiest
Because that's what the Bible's for
Look at the Koinonia
This is the same route as Koinonia, right?
But what is the Koinonia?
It's that which is Bdellukton
Or Akatharton
What?
Bdellukton is pollution
You know what I'm talking about
You know what I'm talking about?
It doesn't smell so good
It's not purged, right?
That cup of abominations
That is what they're taking
They're taking that from this, right?
The Bdellukma
Or those pollutions
Are we all in the right place?
Hit the next one
Boom
And why are we doing it?
It's the sake of the Christon
Remember, this is all within the right
Yeah, yeah
Let's see the relationship
Let's see what's going on
Between Paul
And this dude
And another young slave dude
We haven't met him yet
Yeah, we haven't met him yet
Come here, Onesimus
Give it to me
Paul says, look, man
I've had a lot of fun
Right, and you've supported me
With your love
Right, why?
Because
The splonkna of the saints
Is rejuvenated
By you, brah
That's a direct translation
It even says brah
Now, what it does
Now, Chewie, it does
That's the word for brah
No, I'm serious
Chewie, here we go
Now, what is he doing?
What did he do? He said this is all
