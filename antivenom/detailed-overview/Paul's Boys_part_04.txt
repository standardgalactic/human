When he's getting arrested
Raising his hands saying
I am not a Leicester
Yeah
Do you understand
There are people who kill these people
Yeah
Once you've been in it
Must give you
Must give you some kind of passion
Yeah
Must give you some kind of passion
Good
Kiles was like
It involved poison
You know what
Everybody knew Chiron for in antiquity
Is his drug knowledge
He was
Known as an exquisite physician
But particularly he was known
For his amazing understanding
Of drugs and how they work
He's the one
Who has the poison that kills
Heracles
Ultimately
He knew where to get it
He's got that serpent in the breast
He knows
Right
Okay everybody
Hit me with the next one
Let's keep this going
Now people it's going to get weird
It's going to get weird
I'm going to try to get the people in the back row
Are you ready
This splash is going far
It's a little bit smells like this
What do they call it
There was a Santorum
Or something
Kintaurost
How is Hesechias
Did we read the rest of that definition
We didn't oh we skipped his fades
Hang on they've got to see this
He told me the devil told me no
They must see that one
Watch guys he says they're
Leistai
These Kintauroi like Paul and Jesus
They're Leistai and they're titanes
They're those titanic powers
That's who you're getting
You're getting somebody possessed
By those titanic powers
You remember that older generation
Of divinities when the sons of god
Came and they taught
They taught us all about the drugs
You weren't there devil was
Watch what happens
Kai hoi paitarastai
Who else are the Kintauroi
Or the Leistai
They are the pedarasts
When Jesus Christ
When Jesus Christ
Don't change it
When Jesus Christ said
In the garden of Gethsemane
I am not a Leistais
He was disavowing
The pedarasts
Who were involved
In the circles of prostitution
He was disavowing it
He was saying no that's not me
He's still going to crucify
With two other pedarasts
Right now
How did I just show how
People asked me
Somebody asked me
A couple of weeks ago
Asked me how is it that
People have not caught up with this
How is it that you sir
Could suddenly have
An avenue
To this knowledge that nobody had
That's because of the muse
If you don't respect the muse
You get jack
You get jack
That's what this is
This is a dude
Writing to us
From antiquity
To tell us that your Jesus Christ
Was a pedarast
At least he was saying
When he was arrested on
I'm not a pedarast
I don't know if that makes you feel any better
Look at the last three words
Isn't that nice
What is the oros
Everybody to
Let's go to the next one
It's from oros
Again he says
Equals the oros
I'm dying to know
Tell me what is an oros
This is where they're getting it from
He's telling you
The derivation of the word
Is that it comes from oros
Fantastic
Let's see what it means
The end of the
Oh man
I knew it was going to go here
I told you
Wasn't he
A senator or congressman
A Santorum guy
End of the os sacrum
Look at the little word
In parenthesis after that
It says oropugion
For those of you who aren't big on anatomy
You know
Your os sacrum
It's this at the end of that little
Bone and you've got your
Your buttocks underneath it
Your back above it
Look what
Almond gave us
Almond said
It's identified
Well he does that in Athanas
Later down we get
Identifies with Tauros
Identifies with Tauros
Look at number two
Generally it's rump
People comfortable with that
I got a little comfortable with rump
Until I looked down and I saw in the parenthesis
The very last word is ura
And I know what that ura is
That is what the devil used
To bring a third
Of the angels with him
That's what he did
To his kingdom
He brought a third
He did it with his ura
He did it
With what?
Now it's typically translated as some
Kind of a tale or something
But let's find out what it really is
Keep going
What is that Tauros
For those of you who think I'm making this up
Look if you just look up Tauros in the Oxford
Look what they say
Bull
We all know Taurus
It's also a priest of Poseidon
Cool
It's a sign in the zodiac
And then number three
What does number three say?
It equals cojone
Oh that sounds bad
Also the pudenda mulliebria
