Initiate gets to see
Give it to me, hit me with the next one
All the monisms, by the way
Islam doesn't
Escape, they're also people of this book
Right, so
The monist religions
Of the world
You're anchored
You're built
On a foundation
Of pedarasty
Yeah
Is this K21
We are in K21
Yup, okay
So, here's Paul again
Braggin' about his
Caloopsin, his visions
That he's going to be having, his opening of that
Time, his apocalyptic
Understanding of the timeline
It's going to penetrate him
And it's, wait, what?
What happened?
He came to know
The Mustadion
Right, he came to know
The Mustadion
Paul is going to tell you how he comes
Hit me, we're almost through
Boom, hit me with the next one, watch
You know, he says
In other generations
It wasn't known so well
By the sons of men
Right, you remember
There was a time when we had sons of men
And sons of God
Okay
Among those men
Right, there wasn't
There wasn't this knowledge
It took a son of God
To bring
That knowledge
It took a muse
It took a Moses
To bring that
Knowledge
And what are they going to do with this?
Oh, God
Look at the last two words
We're talking about profetis
We're talking about prophets
Being in Pnellmati
Do you know what the mystery is for?
It's to take a prophet
And to put them in Pnellmati
And do you know what happens
When you're in Pnellmati?
That's when you get
To the third heaven
I don't know
I don't know, but I was
With someone
I don't know if it was in body
Or in spirit
But I saw
I saw
The expanse
Of the third uranos
Yeah
You know what comes out of that expanse?
Venus
That dove comes out
And that's why
Devil chases you around
Because of your splunkna
It's that
Kid's splunkna
That's driving this, watch Paul's going to say that
Give me the next one
Oh, God, what's he
Oh, God, we are all
They're going to be protecting you
What is that mystery?
It's the
Universal
Creation
For those who can share
For those who can share
In the epangelias
In Christoi
Jesu
Look at the last
Look at the bottom two lines
That first word, epangelias
And underneath it, ewangeliu
People have asked me
Who are those sources? I had somebody
Oh, they don't use that way because
Remember a while ago we said
Epangelia
Is a word that means the power
Of a prescription drug
The power of a drug that a doctor
Has given you the recipe for
Used this drug with these components
It's epangelia
Is its efficacy
Whether or not it's going to work
Does it do what it says
Uh-oh
Here's another medical term
Throwing it right in, don't be surprised
That your people are not totally separate
From the rest of the world
You want them to be
You want them to be able to do
What they're doing, you want to pay for
You want them to be able
Guess what
Furies don't care, genocide is genocide
Here it is people
Here's a reference for you
3.6
What are these powers
That we're going to be partaking of
What are these powers, what are these things
What is the mystery
Watch what he says here people
He says, I knew that man
I knew it, I don't know in the body
Or in the spirit, I don't know God knows
He was snatched up
Right into paradise
And I heard
I heard things that should never be
Spoken
Yeah
Go, never be spoken
Snatched up
Snatched up
Okay, these
This is the world
Of the vocabulary that you're dealing
With, with Paul and his children
This is the world
This is the world, the vocabulary
That is
The world of the lay
States
He's using
Lastic
Vocabulary
Okay, if I told you, oh I know
This guy, and all he does all day
Is he talks like he's a drug dealer
He walks around
He talks about this and way
And that and selling that and getting this
And going there
He's got all the jargon down
And he knows all the street
Terms of these things
He's always using
You'd begin to suspect
After a while that the person had
That knowledge of that vocabulary
Because they were involved
In the business
Jesus Christ
Paul the apostle
The author
Of the Septuagint
There, that is the Torah
Right, the Torah is a translation
Of the Septuagint
That Septuagint
The author of that
They know
The same specialized
