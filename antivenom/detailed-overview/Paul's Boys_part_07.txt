Terms
That Paul
And Jesus Christ knew
That were involved
In trafficking
And drugging children
It's all over there
All over their writings
It's like a fingerprint
It goes there
Right on the scene
Kids laying there all beaten up
Watch what happens
Watch what happens
I know it's tough
But give me the next one
Oops, did you lose it?
Chewie
You've been hitting the ale again
Those are the ones who know the mystery
We got that
Taking up to the third heaven
We've been there
Next one
I'm going to ask you
You know what I mean?
Concerning the boy
I just want you to know
He's my boy
I
Made him
In chains
Paul is very affectionate
For Onesimon
Onesimus
He's very affectionate for me
Onesimus
He's a kid
And he ended up
He belonged
To Philemon
And ran away
He stole some shit and he ran away
And Paul has taken up
A real affection for the kid
They met in the penal system
In Rome
And he was like, dude, weren't you the master?
Didn't you belong?
Oh, so they got close
And they got together
Do you know how it always works?
It always works this way
Yeah
You're dealing
With the lace stays
You're dealing with lace stays
Give me the next one
He wants Philemon to take him back
And he says, look, I'll pay anything
Anything he stole for you, I'll pay for it
Because this boy is mine now
And he says, look, at one time
He was translating
At one time, he says, this kid was totally useless
Now, however
He is very
Useful
To both me
And you
Do you understand?
Okay, okay, good
Chewy gave me the hairy thumbs up
Yeah, let's hit the next one
And what does Paul want?
Philemon to deal with this kid
He says, look, I sent you
I sent him to you, right?
Because who's carrying this letter?
Who do you think's carrying this letter?
Right? Paul's still got, you know,
Judicial system stuff to work out
Who do you think is carrying this letter?
It's the kid
And what is he said? This kid is my splothna
If you are lace stays
If you are condauros
You know what that means
He's my sweetness
He is that tool
Whereby I
Am going to prophesy
He is that thorn and flesh
I don't know if I was actually there
I don't know
I don't know
Now, all throughout history
There's theologians everywhere who have said
Oh, Paul the Apostle, he was a very
Luxual, very smart guy
And they look up to him and you've heard sermons
There have been sermons preached for
2000 friggin years
About this guy
Who is using children
They've become useful to him
Because you remember, you realize
The master was saying
What?
You become like one of these little kids
You're not going to enter the kingdom of heaven
Some of you
Are going to be made eunuchs
But people, this is how you have to ascend
Baby, I told you
I told you it would be disgusting
I told you, but this is your reality
This is our text
This is our language
Give me the next one
You're just going to connect a couple of dots here
Look, what is onesimus?
Paul is a little bit
A little bit of a flirt
With the egg heads
And what does he do?
He makes a little pun
Because onesis is
Something that brings you joy
Something that is profitable
Or delightful
Isn't that great?
He is my delight
If I walked in with onesimus
And I was like, yeah, he's my delight
Baby
And I'm going to lift up those serpents with him
You would think
Oh my god, this man needs to be burned
Now you know
Why Paul is going from
Prison to prison
Now you know why
The apostles are getting caught
Haven't you ever wondered
Why don't they just go to the suburbs
And have a big church
Why are they going to jail all the time?
This is your god
This is the dude
Who was
Burst by the guy
Who grants us
Spells
This is the guy
This is Jehovah
This is us
You know what I'm talking about
He grants us to be able to get together
Did you have that picture of Paul
Again from last time?
Where's that one?
Paul and his buddy
Do you have a picture of Paul on his
Paul
And onesimus
The boy who brings you
Advantage
This is the mystery
Take care of him
Take care of him
Paul is writing
A very affectionate letter
In a very
Profitable business
The business
Of prophesying
Through the innards
Of the boy
You mean
That's why
He had so much knowledge
You know
