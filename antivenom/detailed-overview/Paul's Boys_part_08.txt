Yeah
Give me the next one
DuckTale Dan
And Kath and Kip
Can never
Can never tell you this
Because all of the
Have you noticed that all the sources
That we're looking at
This is stuff that they would miss
So what is the Koinonos
Right?
In that thing that Paul says
He wants to develop with his boy
That Koinonia
What is that?
That it's a partnership
A fellowship
It is a joining
A union
It becomes the number two
Because it's a joining
It's a union. Give me the next one
Boom
See where it's from
Look what Paul says
This is what I want
Right?
If you're going to put me in this position
Take this kid
As if you're taking me
So
The closeness between the pedarast
And his
Object of
Pedarasty
Is
The communion
The communion
You thought just because you've heard the word communion
Go ahead fill them with the crazy
Images, Joey
Just because you thought you've heard the word communion
And you sit there Sunday and they say communion
And you vomit out
This guttural visceral
Response
Communion, I know what communion is
When you take and they give you a little wafer
And you pa, pa, maybe it's a Baptist thing
And they have little things, a grape juice
And they give you a home
You take it, oh, blood of Christ
Communion
Voila
That's an antiquity
The real
Christian
Communion
Is between a man
And the boy
Who he is teaching, the mystery
Okay
Sometimes
You gotta have a co-pilot
If you want to jump the rift
Hit me with the next one
We're gonna go ahead and pull out of this
Watch what happens
Okay, come on brother
Right, you know what I want
Yeah
So, mu, ta splachna in Christoi
What does this thing do?
What does the splachna do?
It causes you
To enter into an astinia
An astinia, that bottom
That very bottom of the world
That pre-death
Inability
To function as a living organism
That thing
Relief
We've got relief through the
Splachna
And how is this all happening
In Christoi
Okay
You are sitting
On top of
Peterasty
You are sitting
On top of it
Your culture
Has preserved it
Hit me another one
Yeah brother
Now listen to King James translation that comes out
Yeah brother, yeah
What else is yeah?
Let me have joy of thee in the Lord
That sounds suspicious right off the bat
Wait, what?
Refresh my bowels
In the Lord
Refresh your bowels
Refresh your bowels
Now you're gonna sit there and you're gonna say
Oh no, no, this is not
As dirty as you are making it
He wants him to refresh
His bowels
Okay
Watch what happens, hit me the next one
Oh god, why am I doing this all?
Right?
Make, this is what Paul says to him
He wants him to refresh his bowels
Which is a terrible translation
He wants him
To nourish that kid
Who is so useful to him
And he wants him to treat him
As he treats him
He's sending Heracles out
His student
And there's another pedarast
That he is giving control
Over that kid
And he tells them in Philemon
122
He says
Also, I want you to
Make me a bedroom
Because
I hope
That I can fulfill
Your prayers
And I can
Haridza you
Wait, what?
What's he gonna do to him?
Is this something pedarast on pedarast?
Is this kintalos to kintalos?
Let's see, what is this last?
Haridza
What's Paul wanna do?
What's Paul wanna do to all these people
In this house where they meet
With these kids
He wants to grant him favors
He wants to grant
Him favors
Now
You can sit there in the closet
All you want
And you can say
Dirty, dirty, dirty
You, sir, or dirty
You can sit there and do that
But ultimately
You've gotta make a decision
Do I follow where all this evidence is leading?
Do I watch the language?
Do I learn from the language?
Or do I close my ears
As a jury?
Do I close my ears and say
I'm not gonna hear that part
I'm not gonna take it into account
Right?
That's what atheists do
Watch the language
Here's the English standard of it
At the same time
Prepare a guest room for me
For I am hoping that through your prayers
I will be graciously given to you
Now that's what
The pedarast teacher
In antiquity
In the first century, in the second century
