Sunday morning, dark clouds rising, oh there's no sunshine anywhere.
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom to grasp the message in the air.
Oh, if I could have one wish and know that it would come true,
and wish that God would give us strength to know just what to do,
then we could tear down the fences that fence us down in.
Fences created by such evil men, then we could tear down the fences that fence us down in.
Maybe we could walk together again.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation, Season 6.
Tonight, I've got to take you to a place, a place that no one else has taken you before.
I've got to show you some things that are difficult.
We are going to be pulling them right out in front of you.
Yeah, yeah.
Tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to go to that grotto.
I'm going to take you guys to a place and show you some things.
I need you to be professional.
I need you to be courteous.
And I need you to be ready to get rocked.
Tonight, I'm going to take you to a couple of tags.
Well, more than a couple, but I'm going to take you to some tags.
We're going to be tracking down this, this ancient pirate.
I'm going to take you to a place to show you the latest.
I hear that Yoda in there, guys.
Love it. Love it.
