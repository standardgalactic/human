He was enchained with them, not as one of them, but with them. It's very likely that this dude
was actually not with the gang. Anywho, he was preferable to Jesus who they had just caught.
They had just caught, right? People don't realize it, but there were other Jesuses
in jail when Jesus was arrested. He was not the only person arrested for what he was arrested for.
Yeah. He was placed among the pirates for your sins, evangelicals. He was placed between the
pirates and that little naked boy runs off in history, having left behind his bandage
that was covering his genitalia. He ran away. And you and I live in a world that worships him.
Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing grace. Now, for people who want to say he doesn't have text,
that's all I'm giving you. Please realize it's all I'm showing you, the text.
All right. It's not me. I didn't want to make this system with Jesus.
I didn't want him to be this way. I wasn't there when the dude got arrested, right? To me, this is a
cold case. Yeah. But what I do love is bringing you all that real dirt, that real dirt. It's
gorgeous. Give me another quote. Let's do just a couple more. People need to get on with their
evenings, maybe watch a nice movie or something. Yes. So look at what the crowd's doing. They're
shouting out, right? Don't, right? Don't. We don't want Barabbas, right? Right? The one that's the
laystace. Interesting. Interesting. Poor Barabbas. Don't you feel bad for him? Because it's like
he's there with them, right? He did something wrong. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was just
the wrong place, the wrong time. Maybe it was just a bad deal gone down. You know how it is?
Things happen. People end up chained up with a bunch of pirates. It's just the way it is.
Yeah. Fantastic. You thought he was in a ship, didn't you? No, no, no. Right? Not yet. That's
what they do with the kids. This eunuch that Jesus was with, right? This boy that he was,
you know, obviously he didn't want to be there anyway, right? Because he was like,
oh, I don't want to do this, right? Take this cop away. But my will, but yours,
he's all like, oh, I'm thirsty. He's rocking, man. He's on the poison. He's on the juice.
Let's look at some of the drugs here, Volv. Keep going. Yeah. This next one, yeah.
Yeah. So this is just Barabbas. This is Barabbas with those factions, right? Criminal organizations,
those, well, I wouldn't say mafia because it's not like family. The Romans have what's like
mafias. Don't be surprised, but they do. It's just fact of history, right? Powerful families rising
up and controlling the finances of the neighborhoods. That's all. That's all. Yeah. They tried that
math. Yeah. Didn't work. Power of the deem. Power of the neighborhood. Thanks so long.
Yeah. You see what we lost. We need this now more than ever. We need it. Love it. Go to the next text.
I want to give them good stuff. I know there's plenty. There's plenty of good stuff in here. Oh,
God. Yes, yes, yes. And Jesus came into the temple. Oh, look, this is part piracy that you may not
have considered. Now, I said this in the introduction. Uh-huh. I said this in the introduction. This is
Matthew, by the way. Yeah. I said this in the introduction that there were traffickers in the
temple. Traffickers in the temple. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't the thieves guild. For those of you
evangelicals who want to make the fairy tale, it was not the thieves guild. And it was not insurrectionists.
Yeah. Your glory days history that smells of the crack of Josephus and Philo. No. No. I'm sorry. It
doesn't. Things have to meet a standard. You know, there's standards. It's a museum. It's a museum.
Standards. Right. Okay. So let's go back to the text. Here we are. Here it comes. Something
boldly insulting, please. Um, yeah. And he came into the temple. Yeah. And he threw out all of those
who were, who were doing what? Look at poluntas. Do you remember what the Thracians,
same verb that it was using there? Now it can be just be selling of anything.
Yeah. Doesn't have to be children. Right. The verb doesn't have to be children. Okay. But he kicks
out the sellers. Uh-oh. And the agoradzontas. The agoradzontas. Agoradzontas. Yeah. Those
