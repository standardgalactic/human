participating in the market. What are they going to give? What are they going to, what do they want
here really? Before he kicks over those tables and all that kind of stuff? Let's see the birds
flying. Why? Because we buy dubs for Aphrodite. There's a reason that Mary, the mother of Christ,
had a burning purple ooze in her vagina. There's a reason. It's medical. It's cult. It's mystery.
Were you getting all these terms? Christ. You think Christ, you think Jesus walked onto the scene
and he was the Christ? You think that title didn't come from a thousand years of history?
My goodness people. What kind of, you're willing to believe anything if you're willing to follow
fairy tales. This is history, anthropology. We need evidence. I want this guy's blood.
I want a sample of it. I want to see what he was on. Yeah. Fumigating. Go for it.
Yeah. Doing all his resurrections. Yeah. Love it. Yeah. Go ahead. Hit us with a source.
Let's go. And he came to the, yeah. Oh, and he throws them out. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Jesus, right? He's like after his big move, right? He says, what? He says, it's written. It's written.
And that, you know, I don't get anybody's attention, right? It's written. He's got to do his quote in
law over there, right? It's written. My house is a house of prayer. Prayer. And you have made it.
A what? A spay lion of pirates? A spay lion. What is a spay lion? Quick. You've made my house a
spay lion of pirates. Give me the next. This one I've got for sure. Yeah. There it is. Looking
at it, people. Look at it. A grotto or a cavern. Wait. A grotto or a cavern. What happens in
grottos and grottos and caverns? Does anybody know what you can do in a grotto?
St. Cyprian did. They caught him in one. Yeah. They caught him coming right out of the cemetery.
Yeah. Yeah. It was a beautiful area for, you know, gorgeous. And he had the venom
drilling out of his bottom with prostitutes. So-called. Yeah. Fantastic. That's where we are
cult-wise in history. That's where we are. If you are, and I need to make one note,
I meant to do this earlier, for everybody who's listening now, if you have not

Let's go. Let's keep going. I mean, it's right there. What does he say? What does he say? Oh,
that tholetai. We got to go back. We got to go back and see it. I've got it at the bottom.
I want people to eyeball it. Just so nobody says, yeah, you see it. Yeah. That one. What is something
that's tholetos? Yeah. Look at the, okay, muddy, foul, turbid. Okay. It's opposite to cathodos,
