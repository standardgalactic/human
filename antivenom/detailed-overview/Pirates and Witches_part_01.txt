We all know it doesn't go
Beyond Eros
You can even get to the devil
And plow right through him
Because he is
Subject to Eros
Yeah, power
That's real power
That's what makes everything
Fantastic
If you're going to get into the disguise
And be there with the purple
You're going to have to
Pick up some things
Are you on your throne?
Are you sitting on the throne?
Please, congregation
Have a seat
Fantastic
Before we get to the purification
I want to let you know Hyman
Was a good guy
And he saw, he's an Arcadian
And he saw
These girls getting kidnapped
He saw these girls getting kidnapped
By
Pirates
And what are they going to do with them?
You're going to see in a minute
They sell souls
Ancient pirates sell souls
Who do they sell them to?
Those who have their attention
Yeah
Okay
Let's dive in
To Hyman
Tonight
And see who he was
By the way, it's a great ending
Because Hyman is able
To bring us
Right into the heart
Of what
Piracy was all about
Right into the heart of it
Even so much so
That we're going to look at Jesus yelling
In a public park and for him
With a naked boy screaming
I am not a pirate
We're going to get back
To that zone
We're only going to hit that peripherally
I want you to see Hyman who rescues
These girls
Rescues them
What does he do?
He dresses up as a girl
And see the thing about Hyman was
He was so good looking
He was so good looking
You know
Boy, girl
Who cares man?
Beauty is beauty
And everybody said Hyman
Had beauty
Oh goodness
The songs that we sing
At marriages
The songs
Where do they come from?
They come from this
You know who sang this song first?
Orpheus did
At Medea's wedding
Fantastic
Where do you think all that purple was coming from?
Where do you think they were
Taking it and using it
From
Kolkis
Love it
She was Queen of Babylon too
Right?
Love it
I mentioned Medea
I want to show you something
I want to go two down
Slides
Go to this one
I want to show you somebody new
We're going to open up tonight
Are you ready?
This is never seen before
Never seen before
At least about 800 years
About 800 years
Because the nerd
From Byzantium
Constantinople
Whatever
This nerd
Who's a Byzantine nerd
Is reading all of this classical literature
What's your name again?
Eustatius
Eustatius
I'm leaving him alone
I'm not being rough with him
He's kind of giving it up here
Because he loves classical sources
And he has a whole bunch
That you and I no longer have
You mean he's got quotes
