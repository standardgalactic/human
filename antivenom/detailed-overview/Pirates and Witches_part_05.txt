Pirate knuckleheads
Tried to take Penelope
Why would they be so curiously interested?
You know what Athena
Told Penelope to do
Athena told Penelope to have sex
With every one of them
Which she did
Who was that offspring?
Oh, my goodness
Oh, my goodness
Hyman rescues
His beloved
He does, he kills the pirates
Oh, God, love it
Let us purify
Let us purify
Here's what I want to do
Are you ready for this?
We're going to go through a little programming
With Chewie here
And I want to set your mind
This is actual text
Translated by me
From Euripides
Roll it Chewie

And with that
We're in that Bronze Age
We're coming up to Pan
And we want to see
I want you to see Pan
And I want you to see Achilles
In all of
His glory
I want you to see Achilles
Serving through that
Spirit
Can we have Achilles?
Oh, God, isn't he beautiful?
Isn't he beautiful?
Let us keep going
With the text
And bring out
Let's go to the next one, Chewie
And hit it
We got a couple more SAR systems
Good
Here we come
Here we go, right there
Beautiful
This is the text that you just saw
Translated
I just wanted you to see it
Written up there in all of its glory
Hit the next one, Chewie
And I want you to realize
This is written by the son of the root cutter
And I just want you to see a couple
Couple things
Look at that second line
The light
Did you notice the light bringers were in there?
Did you notice Saba
Was in there?
Yeah, and
Oh, who men I want
Lord Hyman
Lord Hyman
What a fortunate
Marriage you make
In your
Archive, princely bed
Hyman, want ox Hyman
Give me the next one
Oh, God, can you see it?
Building up, remember
There are people who are getting married
There are people who are getting married
We give
The pirates
What they deserve
And from them
We take the booty
That's who we are
We follow
Do you understand?
We protect the virgin
Right?
What are you, savage?
What do you think all of our thoughts of the polis came from?
Did you think you knew the virgin
And now you do?
Good
Let's go to it
Let's, yeah, here
Oh, God, what does she want?
Oh, here we go
This is glory
What is she bringing in?
She's catching on fire, man
That's the false puros
That thing is a blaze
And she is catching stuff on fire
And she's giving that light
Oh, Hyman
Oh, Hecate
