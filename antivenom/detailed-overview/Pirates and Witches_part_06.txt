She is giving that
What is she really doing?
What is Cassandra doing?
Giving us here these proclamations
Coming from her sweet lips
Her sweet oracular
Legeic lips
What is she giving us?
She's giving us that purity
That purity
Of that
Bed
Huh, interesting
The purity, do you understand?
The democracy came from a cult
That protected
The purity
Of the virgin mother
Wait a minute
I'm getting confused
Shut up, Jesus
Where's your whip when you need it?
Let's go to the next one
Oh, you know what, I should insert here the comment
That I was going to talk about earlier
Somebody wrote in a comment
And said
You're a degenerate homosexual
And I just want you to know
That your
Interest
In my sexuality
Is irrelevant to this initiation
But it is duly noted
By everyone here
That you indeed have an interest
And it's okay
My mojo
Works
In all forms
All forms
You don't have to
Apologize
It's not your fault
If you were overcome
Ah, let's go on with the next quote
Oh my goodness
Look at this
For those of you who talked about
Drugs and what not, shame on you
Shame on you
Yeah
You know, clean up
You know, what's wrong
And I don't
Look, I'm not a martial arts expert
I don't know what kind of vibe I gave off
That people think I'm a martial arts expert
But I swear, somebody's going to walk up to me
Someday
And test that
And they're going to end up putting me on a concrete
Because look
That's not my style, I appreciate it
Good for you, I appreciate it
No
Let's go to much more nerdy pursuits
What is this? Oh my god
Look, Phoebus, bring Phoebus
Bring that ethereal chorus
Bring that Hosseos
That pure chorus
Did I tell you that we were going to the theater
And that theater is the place
Where they bring in the purification
Here it is, people
Loud and clear
From Euripides
What am I doing?
She's the priestess and she's there with her
Bay leaves, right? Her laurel
And she's there
Doing her job with the thue
What? Yes, doing her job
With the thumi amata
She is using those instances
She's fumigating
So that she can be in that
Aracular state
Why? Look what she yells out
Hymen
Hymen, three times
Hymen
And then she tells her mother to dance
Dance
Bring the joy
Right?
What does she want?
What does she want? She wants
That shout
From Hymen
She wants that shout
In that sacred song
That recognition
That understanding
Of beauty
She wants that
That is
Elysium
This is the reason
That every mystery religion
In the world
Including Christianity
Is based upon and centered around
A union
A union
What do you think all the drugs
