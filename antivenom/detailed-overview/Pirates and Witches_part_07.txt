And sex and cult were for?
It's a reflection
Right through that
Black hole
Didn't you notice we've been passing through a black hole
It's the only way you can get
These ghosts to do anything
Let's go
Let's go Eustathias, you still there?
I'm going to spare the whip tonight
On Eustathias, let's go
Next one
And who else do we want to come?
We want Phoebus to come
We want Phoebus Apollo to come
I just want to point that out
Chewie, can you bring up
Did we bring Phoebus along?
Oh my god
Apologies to the leader
Of the muses
Oh my god
That's what you expect
To get with Bacchus
There we go
That's what you expect to get from a Bacchus
One third time polar switch
Love it
Oh god, did you know the math
That they do is practically
You know
Well, it's way beyond
Let's keep going
We've got a couple more
I want to provide you with a couple of quotes
Here, look
What do people say about Jesus?
You can't
You can't leave Jesus alone
No
Right now that he's in our custody
Because we all know he's in Leicester
He's going to get it constantly
Here Jesus, have a little more
This is a segment
Whip for Jesus
Tell me Jesus
What's he going to tell me?
Tell me Jesus
Oh
Your flash gets so pink
And rosy when I smack it
Stop
You like that too much, don't you?
Tell me something
What did people say about you?
They said what?
You said you were a demoniac
And that you look at that last word
Minotai
All of my students
Will recognize
What is he doing?
He is mantic
He is entering
That ecstasy
Jesus was in profit
Because he was smart
About current events and history
No
He was at mantic because he was out
Of his mind
The only way he got there was with drugs
Through this cult
Through these pirates
Performing this mystery
And that's why
He said
I am not
One of them
Fantastic
They crucified him with two others
They caught two
Right
Had him there
Right
Okay
What do you think Athena did to clean up everything?
Come on
Technology of the Venoms
Technology of the Venoms
Oh
God
These are curatives
Crazy body changing
Curatives
How do you think
Achilles got to where he got?
Yeah
Let's go to the next one
I think I just heard snappy
Fall off his chair
Okay, are you ready?
Are you ready?
The one whom Jesus loved
Right? Hey, this is in the present
The one who Jesus loves is
And for those of you
What is that?
C.S. Lewis
C.S. Lewis
C.S. Lewis
Oh, I gagged him
C.S. Lewis
C.S. Lewis
Would be able to tell you
Hey, guess what?
