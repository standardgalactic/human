of Caucasus and Persees, the ruler of the Taurians. Both of them were known for their cruelty.
The children of Helios were marked by specific features, including hair,
the color of the sun's burning rays, skin that glowed and eyes that bore the shining
mark of Helios. Their culture was driven by drugs and the drug trade. Their arrows were
their defense, tipped with poisons that gave the Taurians and the Caucasians a distinct
military advantage. Descendants of horse cultures, these people ultimately dominated the Black Sea
as pirates.
One need only to sail by the great tower of Medea when one entered into the Black Sea to know
that the region was theirs. The region belonged to the daughters of Helios.
