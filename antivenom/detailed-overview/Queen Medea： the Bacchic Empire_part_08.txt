Medea made an empty image of the goddess Artemis. She then filled it with drugs of all capacities.
Next, she Christed herself making her hair gray and her skin wrinkled. Her appearance
was such that anyone who saw her would think that she was an old woman and then
picking up this mystery initiation image and she carried it into the city where the people
were put into divine fear from it. Just as Medea was in a state of enthusiastic mania,
so did the people come under the control of the idol.
And as they did, as they entered ecstasy, Medea spoke the news of the arrival of a goddess
who should be embraced. She said this goddess had come to bring the people to a place
of fortune to protect their king. All in a state of mania worshiped the goddess with sacrifice.
