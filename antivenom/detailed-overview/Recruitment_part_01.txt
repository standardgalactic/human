we're here for the muse, are you ready, I'm going to, all of that was just to get the ship to go to the place
that we needed to go, everybody off, what I'm taking you to tonight, is going to be the most horrific,
horrific mystery right with Jesus Christ, with Jesus Christ, and for those of you who call yourselves Christians,
Naughty, naughty, you know what, did you see the Olympic Committee apologizing, did you see them apologizing,
why would you do that, you just gave them immunity, you just gave them immunity, why did you do that,
you should have been saying, we don't need your apology, do you understand what the muse did when she set up free speech,
do you understand, she's going to prevent you from having any kind of monist takeover, monist takeover,
wait, before we're even getting into the Bible, people are saying, oh, oh, for the people who sent me messages
and said, oh, I think I get it now, thank you for sticking in there, I appreciate it, I appreciate it, right,
for those of you who doubt the monist fervor and the overthrow of the American Democratic Republic,

And again, Christians get out and vote just this time, you won't have to do it anymore,
four more years, you know what, it'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,
