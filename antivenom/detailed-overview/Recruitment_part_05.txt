You mean every time a Christian says I'm born again, they are talking about a process whereby somebody is put through a transgender mystery,
yep, it's all in the pharmacy, it's all in the pharmacy, the drugs don't lie, that's the one thing, never, you can pile all the theology and all the theological radiation you want into this,
you can't beat the drugs, because it's nature, it's nature, oh God, let's go to the next one, it's going to get gross people, just hang on there,
oh this is not the gross part, what does Jesus have in his right hand while he's telling you that if you want to cut off your testicles and transition for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,
what does he have in his hand, he has seven stars, he has seven stars in his hand, okay, all right, for those of you who have ears to hear,
other than that, read Seneca's Medea and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about, give me the next one, look people, because what's going on,
now we're in the graveyard, Jesus is there, Mary Magdalene crew have run out, we're going to keep pounding this graveyard, let's keep walking around these ancient graveyards in Judea and see what happens,
you remember folks, it's like Sodom and Gomorrah, right, there was so much ex-pornating, what did people do, they went after that strange flesh, you know the strange flesh I'm talking about,
they became a paradigm, an example of the burning that is Ionic, wait, are we talking about the same thing, I'm starting to get a little queasy, somebody walk behind me, I need some help,
I need some help, give me the next one, that was Jude telling us what's going on, what are these people doing in these rites, Jude tells us here in verse eight,
what are they doing, they're entering incubations, they're entering into an altered mental state whereby they can see visions, did you wonder why all the PGM was full of all that vision inducing spellery,
take these drugs and stick them here and put them up here, finally swallow them all and stick them in your ear and then you're going to be able to chant blah blah blah all over, god it's just blah blah blah all over, what am I doing,
I'm entering the visionary world, I'm receiving, I'm putting myself into a position that I can receive a vision and you can do that with the drugs, you can do that with the drugs, they are doing it with the drugs and you know what you do with those drugs, you Christ them,
go Christ yourself, you know, you got a problem, you got some emotional problem, you 30 year old with a six graders mind, you know what you should do, you should go off, take a week, go off and purify yourself, go through the motions,
let them give you what they're going to give you and then the stuff that you see that comes out of your soul, okay, they're going to Christ you, please Christ me, give me the next one, give me the next one, here it comes, now people, here's the gross part,
I've saved this for last and I'm going to hit a peak here, we're going to go through this pretty quick and I'm going to hit a peak here, just get you to, you know what, just bring me to the end, let's go all the way, let's go all the way, can we get across the finish line for once,
Ryan, you pastor's wives, can we just once in the train make it across that finish line, before you go back, this is from the letters of Clement, that's what it says and he's writing to Theodore and I just want to remind you that he says, thank you Theodore, good boy, you took, I'm translating right,
look, you took all that dirtiness, those teachings of the Carpacrations and you stifled that stuff, you stifled it, good job, these people who are prophesying are those wandering stars, now that's what the Greeks had called this prophetic ability for years, right, the wandering, the wandering stars,
Jesus has seven of them in his hand, seven of them, okay, are you ready, you're like, huh, you know where he got them, he got them from Mary, he pulled them out of her, he pulled them out of her, okay, if that's confusing, just listen up, these people, he says, these prophets, these wandering stars, they don't follow the very precise, constricted way of the law, no they don't, but they jump into this abyss,
that is a place that you cannot enter and return from, these people are doing it and how are they doing it, they're doing it with the burning purple, they're entering into states of death, he says, it plunges them into that fleshy flesh, doing fleshy flesh, what, oh, you'd understand, you'd understand if you were there,
you'd feel the flesh for the first time, have you felt your flesh, have you felt your flesh, would you be surprised if I told you, you can take it, would you be surprised if I told you, you have not, according to the world of apostles and prophets, you have not understood your own flesh, you have not felt it,
the mystery will cause you to be born again and you will feel your flesh, did he say we would die, listen, listen Eve, you're not going to die, I'll give you the death inducing drugs but it won't kill you,
so we've got this student, Alexandria, Clement, and Mark, the question at hand is what about Mark's gospel, what about all the hidden teachings, what about the stuff that you know we don't talk about publicly,
give me the gorgeous picture by the way, beautiful job, we don't talk about this stuff, what do the people do, says Clement, he says they get all worked up in gnosis, you mean every time Neil comes on here and says, you have just attained true gnosis,
this is what they're talking about, they're talking about being filled with that gnosis which is what, it's the deep things of Satan, do you understand the deep things of Satan, are you pulled to the gnosis,
yeah, give me the next one, what happens to these people, let's see, now remember this is the enemy, because how do these people work, they work through Andrapododon,
they work through what, Andrapododon, that sounds like something, you know, out of place, Epithomeon are your passions,
what are Andrapodotic passions, give me the next one, Andrapodotic passions, this is what they're working through, this is your technical term for what part of your brain they're skimming, are you ready, they're skimming that part that causes you to want to enslave,
causes you to want to kidnap, do you see, this is the summer camp for the Leistai, do you see what's going on here, it's the summer camp, you can take it down for the Leistai, that is what the wandering is all about,
it's what the wandering, now you're going to say to me, you mean there's a cult that has that much control over the people that it can trade, it can trade and traffic, dude, there's not just one cult, right, this is Mediterranean commerce,
this is what the Romans are trying to clean up, and this is why people like Jesus Christ who got arrested in a public park with the naked boy Mark 1451 and 52, this is why he is crucified with other Leistai, there's two other, there's two of them,
they put him right in the middle, put him right in the middle, they're trying to clean this world up, right, Roman law, Roman culture is reaching out, right, trying to create a civilization, right, you can't function,
