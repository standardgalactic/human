going to induce a certain response.
This is where we get the word estrus from.
Estrus from.
Yeah.
Estrus.
Do you understand the impulse now that is the oyster and how do you create this impulse?
You do.
I just told you you do it with arrows and arrow poison.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Yeah.
The cup of Babylon indeed.
Right.
It is technically.
Love it.
Give me the next one.
What are we thinking about when we're thinking about this oyster and this mania that comes
from the arrow poison?
Here's the name EOS.
I just want you to notice in Greek.
EOS.
What does it mean?
It means arrow.
It means arrow.
Now give me this next one.
EOS.
Wait.
What?
It means another thing.
Yes.
It means poison.
As of serpents.
One of the.
No, not one of the most.
Just leave that up for a second.
The most.
Unattributed genius.
To human history is the development of reptilian venoms.
Yeah.
And the antidotes that will counteract those venoms.
Yeah.
And they didn't look at it as counteracting.
They looked at it as.
Potentiating.
Right.
That theriac.
That beast.
That theriac is a compound formula.
And it holds up the cup.
Of Lady Babylon.
What is EOS?
It's poison.
Poison of serpents.
Look, look, look, look, look, look.
Look at the bottom.
They're very bottom.
Poison it says in the Latin is virus EOS.
Look what they did.
They put a diagram.
It's probably because the Romans are being influenced by the
Etruscans and the Greeks.
In the north.
And they're Pulaski and.
Thony and earth.
Autochthonous ancestors.
So they're getting that diagram.
It's a what sound.
It's an invisible letter in Greek.
Isn't that awesome?
It's an invisible letter in Greek.
Think of this.
Think of this.
They understood.
They felt.
Where this letter actually was.
We do some Latin.
Tell me.
So that's why you see the V looking thing.
That's actually a what sound in classical Latin.
Bring up the next one.
Yeah.
Bring to me.
What is it?
We do some Latin.
Look, it says it's from that EOS, right?
But what is it?
Some slimy liquid.
Yeah.
In particular, it's used in the bad sense of like a poisonous liquid,
a poison of venom, right?
Or a virus.
Synonymous with when anum.
What is when anum?
When anum is drug, baby.
Right.
Poison.
You can translate it as poison too.
And the funny thing is, is that comes right out of.
The dawn star.
Right out of the dawn star.
How do I tell you that?
Venus.
Do you notice Venus is in there?
Yeah.
The root.
Linguistically Venus.
Why do I have Venus associated with the drug?
Give me the next one.
Why do I have Venus associated with the drug?
This is starting to get kind of strange.
Look, people in the paper, they told you we have to consider the,
the context here, the religious context, the ritual context,
because that's going to be changing things like the drug.
You want to know what the drug really was.
Right.
You have to know what they did to it, how they prepped it,
how they used it.
And we have that stuff in the absence of the conventional
means to start a scientific investigation.
We take the unconventional approach of attempting to arrive at
the nature of Lemnian Earth by working backwards.
That is from scrutiny of the existing evidence.
Okay.
Now watch this people.
We submit that this evidence should be collectively encoded in
the following major areas of study.
A, the relevant texts of classical authors.
Yeah, you could have stopped right there.
And I would have been like, oh yeah, baby, you're now we're there.
B, the understanding of the nature of clays.
Okay.
You see what's happening.
We're bringing in an expertise.
We're going to do some geology.
We're going to figure out how many angstroms those things are
apart.
And then next thing you know, we've got a better understanding.
I see of what the, what was at least in the environment of the
drug before it was changed by the priestess.
And C, the numerous accounts relating to the ritual.
Oh, look at that.
They're acknowledging that the ritual now is of value or is
critical to understanding what the drug was.
I'm going to say something.
Okay.
You can take it down.
I'm going to say something that's going to shock you.
There is no ancient mystery, including Christianity, including Judaism.
There is no ancient, oracular mystery that does not use drugs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They all do.
And there's so many of them.
I can read Gaylen and just stuff goes in one ear and out the other.
There are a whole bunch of different types of plants.
Plants that we can't even identify properly.
I know God, you, the polypharmacy is just, it's an understanding of
our environment that we, we just don't have modern, modern healthcare
doesn't take this into consideration.
The balance that is in your environment.
It doesn't, it doesn't do that.
Let's go to the next one.
Chewie, this is fantastic.
I want to, we've got to hurry up being the devil.
Are you ready for this?
Okay.
Here, give me that one.
What is the cult context?
Here is the cult orphic hymn to Festus.
Yeah.
And you know what they're, that first line says,
thumium liban omanan.
That means we're going to end this with the, with the singing of this hymn.
