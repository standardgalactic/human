She's amazed at this process that's going on
Next one, please
Yeah, Aurora
Notice the name Aurora, rutilans
Kapilos pectinat
She's calming
Her red or glistening red rutilans is like
I don't know, it's a description of the glowing
That you have, oh yes here, we'll do this
A description of the glowing that you have
When Aurora appears, it's a sheen from her hair
And it is rutilans, oh isn't that nice?
Her hair is punikeos, punikeos, gorgeous
Gorgeous, could you give us back that text Chewie?
Thank you, yeah
And what is she doing as she calms her hair?
She's blowing out, she's pouring out
Dawn, eos, look at that last word, eom
Yeah, there's a diagramma in that
We're going to see this, that diagramma
Most people, go ahead and bring me up
Most people think that the diagramma
From the Mycenaean Greek that's going back to about
1600 BC
Yeah, that Mycenaean Greek is carrying that diagramma
But people refer to that as the origin
And that the Romans, across the Adriatic
They really picked up through the Etruscans
This association with the diagramma
There's a Pulaskian note in this
In the Pulaskian culture, we're talking about older
Older, do we have that map there?
You can show some people with references
We'll get there, we'll get there in the sources
Here we go, look, oh this is trippy
What's going on?
Look right here, that's fine, look
Here I am, above the world
And look at all of the places that they have gone
Look at the Pulaskian culture, these are all references
So you've got them heavy, we also have them here
We also have them right here, oh that's nice
Lesbos, they call the island of Lesbos
Pulaskias, isn't that nice?
The land of the Pulaskians
And this is the same thing we're getting
In Northern Italy through the Etruscans
The Tyranoi, the Etruscans didn't call themselves Etruscans
Man, that's never how it works out historically
That's what somebody else called them
The Tyranoi or the Tirsanoi
Have a Pulaskian root
So this is an older culture that's Bronze Age
Bronze Age, when you're thinking Mycenaean
You're thinking getting into the Middle Late Bronze Age
Getting into the Late Bronze Age
Boom, you got this explosion of this mystery
So this is really going back to the origin
Yeah, even the sea, remember the sea
We're going to see the sea in a minute
And we're going to see it through the purple
This is, oh my, this stuff is okay
Bunker's your steep bouncer
Go outside and talk to the wind for a minute
But yeah, buckle in, this is going to be good
Okay, let's get another reference up
Fantastic, yeah, oh, this is Juno
Yes, asking Cyprus for help
And she says send that boy love
What is he, he's carrying a quiver
Right, my Cyprus, yeah
And let that weirago
See that last word on the second line
That weirago is, that's Eve that we saw before
That's how we translate Eve in the oldest
Of the Latin versions, right
And so yes, the only one that works
That means lead from man, right
Like the text says, it's the only one
But that weirago is that old Etruscan manerva
It's that some people would translate it virgin
But what is she, she's furibunda
That's a special word used in cult
And that means she who carries the daimon
That's the inspired one, okay
So we're talking about a weirago
Which is a, typically described as a manly girl
As a manly girl, yeah
As a girl who is not yet developed
Yeah, sexually but is developed muscular wise
Yeah, and you know gymnasts
Kind of a weirago is somebody that
You know, you go into battle with
Or that you hunt with
That's what a weirago is, right
A lion huntress, Cyreni is that weirago
Okay, I think it's a beautiful portrait
Because what we're doing is we're assembling a portrait
Of Lady Babylon, go ahead
That same, yeah, yeah, right
So let her fall by that fire
That fire of yours that burns
Let the furor teach us to love
Because that's what she has
Madea has that furor, right
And then a little bit he talks about
Let her just walk away from the shrines of the goddess
What goddess? The goddess Diana
carries the quiver, right
She's trying to take control of this
What is she?
Well, so far we know she is an oracle
All right, remember she's one of the captives
One of the, we just read the first Yasun
So right, you think the name Jason is the dude's name
No, it's a title within a cult, right
The first one of these abducted her
The burning purple
Isn't that cool? Isn't that cool?
That's amazing, yeah
Through a series of kings we go
Right, loving it, loving it
Okay, give us more text, man
What's there about Madea, please
Oh, okay, now this is, I'm just going to go through
I'm going to fly through this
And I just want to set a picture for you
Yeah, so I'm going to start translating now
It pains my soul to tell you
Of the abominations of the black virgin
It pains my soul to show God's taken captive
To show the manipulation of elements
To show nature given to serve a girl
The word there is Puella that he's using
Remember, she is in this state of not yet having finished puberty
Yeah, very tall
Yeah, very tall
But with the appearance, with the gynomorphic appearance
Right, the androgenic appearance
Of approximately a 12-year-old
Thanks to the Babylonians
They were the ones who figured that out
And there she is in that year
Preserved with those serpents
Yeah, oh, this is good stuff
This is cult right here
Is it me or did we just land in a giant...
I mean, we just showed up and here everybody's got the robes
And you know, here they come
