This is gorgeous, bring us up another one
The same text please, same text
Yeah, so what does she say?
What does she say? She says
I am able, right?
This is what she says
But the poet is saying
It really shouldn't be done
I shouldn't be saying this
Anyway, so I hate to show you the nephos
The terrible things that she does
Turning, you know, God's captive
And controlling nature itself, right?
What else does she do?
She brings the stars of the pole
That is the pole stars
And for those of you who are reading
The PGM, the Papyrus Grachai Magikai
Tune up
Okay, here are your pole lords
Kai et foibi cursus
And the course of Phoebus
And the stars of the chylem
Of the heaven, right?
What does she do?
She moves these by her own arbitrio
By her own will, right?
The will mulietis
The will of the wife
Which Dracontius is real, real, real strict
About saying, look, in your trancy
You have Hera, Aphrodite, and Minerva
And don't forget it, right?
So you're going to see each of these three
Coming out in this, okay?
This is all framed, of course, within the
Oracular cult, right?
So I've got the cursus foibi
Okay, good, okay
Because, line six, because what she orders, right?
That nephos that she orders, right?
That's what happens when she commands the ether
To send out the flames
Oh, isn't that gorgeous?
You've heard this convention from antiquity
You've heard about this convention
It's called drawing down the fire
Yeah, or the fire of Uranus
Yes, and it's a special thing
It's a special production
That the only a maga would understand how to do
Only someone with the purple would understand how to do
It's the breathing of the fire, they would say
The breathing of the fire
And people wanted to see her
Gorgeous, bring that up one more time
That big text one more time, please, thank you
Yeah
Her voice
Shots through the air
And makes the living and the dead
When she herself turns back fate
To a course that she would want
She is the one who is given the sacrifice of the stranger
She runs through the temples of Scythian Diana
We are steadfastly in the Crimea
Yes, gorgeous
Look at line 11
She possesses the star-bearing heaven
In her abominable breast
And she presses the gods with her prayers
This mirago to do what is unwilling that she wants
Love it
She sings songs in different languages
And burns in appearance
She says names, the names
And these things, it is indecent for a poet to learn
We will sing
Like Paul Hymnia, the mother of Orpheus
Right?
This is the work of Paul Hymnia, the mother of Orpheus
Yes, nice, nice, love it
Okay, so let's look at her and see what kind of person Lady Babylon is
I'm going to go a little bit over, so just hang in there
It's a little bit long, I'm sorry, and I thank you for your time
Chewie, hit the next quote, please
Yes, this is now Venus, right?
We're all here gathered, waiting for the morning star, right?
So this is Venus, and she says, my child is here
He's sprinkling the air with many types of flowers
He breathes out an ambrosial odor, right?
Odor, that's what happens when Arrel shows up, right?
When a morse shows up, he suddenly can smell the ambrosia
You know, that spring ambrosia
Okay, and while she was talking, the civius Venus was talking
Her son came and hovered over her gremium
What's that? It's a lap, it's a lap
Anhelans, do you know what love does?
Love sits over the lap of Aphrodite
Breathing the vapor
Breathing that vapor
I'm talking to you about a deep, deep mystery
Yeah, let's keep hunting here, love it, keep going
We've got a few more, next please
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Who is this Eros, Pirouis?
Oh yes, that just means the flaming one, right?
The flaming one, right? What is he?
He is that men's Ignea Mundi
That burning mind of the cosmos, right?
Yes, Atkwe Wapur
He is that vapor, polly of the pole
What kind of vapor? That one that produces that second vapor
He is the continuance of things, the succession, right?
He is the affection, he is nature, he is type
He is the source, the fountain, the author, the beginning
You, you great Amur are the generative health
Yes, you are that Woloptas
You are that pleasant thing to be desired
You are the Princaps, and for those of you who don't recognize him
He is the Princaps Pietatis
The prince of religious piety
Yes, yes
Another one, please
Yep, so here we are
Who is this Medea?
Look at line 136
And look at the last two words
Yep, Medea Sacerdos
First word on the next line, Sacrilega
Medea is the sacrilegious priest
Yeah, think about that for a minute
She is the one who brings the abomination
The anti-religious religion
That is the oracular
It is the base of the oracular
Tonight's subtitle was Why Must Christians Lie?
They must lie because they must find a way out of themselves
Yes, yes, bring it up
We've been all talking about the truth
And who is lying to us?
Lies, lies, lies
Yes, yes, right
Bring us the oracle
She won't lie to us
She has no reason to
Okay, the dude, I'm sorry
But your dude was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy
Yelling about child predating
