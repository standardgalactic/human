He provides her prophecy
That came from her mouth
When she was on the island of
Thera
It was preserved
By
The Pythian
Priestess
That was
Wrapped up in what
Pindar was
Describing
So anyway, good stuff
Let's get, come on
We're almost through
Lucifer's there, fantastic
Fantastic
There we are, Lucifer
Very important
Aurora, that's why you saw Aurora before
Because you know what family
We're in the family
Of the Donbringers
These are the Donbringers
Oh, look at this
Okay, now
For those of you who think you're so smarty smart
Here is something
Out of her lips
Right, so we're within the cult
We're looking at an imprecation
Right, that's coming from her
It's coming from the source
Of the burning purple
She says
Aus
Grandfather
Son
Witness
Yeah, son is an S-U-N
Right, soul
And for those of you who don't smell
Rome yet, you should start to now
Because the worship of soul
Is very important
This is her
Aus
Her grandfather
So
Perseche Mithra
Oh, do you like that?
Do you like that?
Perse's a Mithras
Oh, that's lovely
If you don't love that, you're in a bad place
Guess where
This is coming from
Guess where Mithra
Or Mithra is coming from
It's coming from the Donbringers
Right
Echus noctis
Moon
That beauty of night
Furia
The furies, wait a minute
Yes, Medea, who is
The priestess
Of
The right to murder
The stranger
She's that priestess
And she
Is invoking
Her grandfather
Mithras
Beautiful
And we have the furies
Right, because this is the
Abominable
Right
We thought it was over
But when you stand before those gates
It turns out
The universe strains you
Proserpina
And Pluton
Uh oh, this is a death cult
This is an underworld death cult
Yeah, you're right
That's why it's wrong for the poet
To know this
It's wrong for the poet to profane
What how is Medea described
As the profaning
Priestess
Are you beginning to see
Lady Babylon
Akipe so radians animus
Yeah, receive
The souls
Radiating sun
You
The bodies, Lona
The nutriment of the soul
Lovely
At the very last, the line
Look at the last word, this is a gorgeous word
Umbras
Umbras
Umbras
It means shades
Shades
Those shades
Of those who came before us
Right
The leader
Of night
Will bring
Those forward
The death
The dead shall rise again
Can we get a little less of the background
I hope that background's not creeping in
Let me know in the chat
Taking a background
Fantastic
One more, let's get another one
Please
I just want you to see Moses is here
Moses
Right
But here he is
We dug up Moses tonight
And don't be surprised
You saw the snake thing
You saw the fact that he made a little
Tent
Where you could walk into it
And pass out, you could hear the voice
Of Jehovah
You heard that, right?
He's the muse, baby
By the way, this is
Pretty contemporary stuff
You know what I mean?
Moses, it turns out
Was one of the earliest
Corruptions
