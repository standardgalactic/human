It's everything I want today
It's
Beyond
It's just
It's wrote all this in poetry
Is this all in poetry?
I'm tying up so many ends here
I mean, you've got jazzabal
Jazzabal for me
It's an aim, it's like
Where's the prince?
Where's the prince?
And then you bring in the prince
Princaps
And that's Caesar
And I'm connecting just
I can't
I can't get over it, to be honest with you
This is
One source
Who's bought us
It's just unbelievable
Is
Where can you get this?
I want to read all this
Where can you get it?
It's just amazing
Yeah, you know
That's a good question
Rob, where can you get this?
And how was he writing this?
Is it poetry?
Is it this?
Yes, it's verse
And it's in the
Verse that is used
By the
Oracular cults
It is the Dactylic Hexameter
And
So when of course
Whenonus, who's writing
His great epic of Dionysus
He's going to use the same
Way of poetry
The same melody
Right, the same marching
Order
That the priestesses
Who are performing
These rites that they're using
Right, so
There's a level of authenticity
Of what Drakontius is doing
And honestly, some of the vocabulary
That he uses is just
It's incredible
You can see the influence
Of the Etruscan
Right there
Out in the open
And the richness of this
Early Bronze Age cult
Which
If you can get just a glimpse of it
You're in good shape
But that's what the language does
It brings us that
Let me ask Snappy
How is your
Project
Of interviewing
Going?
I notice that you're getting
More focused
What are your interviews going to start
What do you want to focus on?
Right now
I'm focusing on interviewing
People who have been connected to this
And I've been enjoying the conversations here
Tomorrow I'm going to be talking
With Nick Cathonius
Who is the joint fight club winner
That should be good tomorrow night
But really what I focus on
Is magical practice
And how we
Utilize these
Mysteries and what you've been showing us
And what we've been doing here
There's been so much discussion about things
Like the sortace and necromancy
I really want to explore those topics in depth
And I want to have
Additional speakers who know about that
History come on as well
Ah, see how
That sounds good
See, that's alluring
Oh, yeah, fantastic
Rob, what are you doing
For the world, Rob?
Leaning Greek at the minute
That's where my focus has been
But
We need somewhere where we can
Go and meet
And we're kind of restricted at the
Many, so I'm not going to go into details
But coming Wednesday
I think we might have
Well, we will have a solution
There'll be another discord
Going live on Wednesday
And I'll give the address out
And I'll all be
Prepared and ready for it
But
It's rather focusing on these episodes
This episode is like
The epitome of what
This discord
Will be about
The sources and discussing
What's in them
And what's in the episodes
Strictly the episodes, that's all I'm
Reliable
That kind of
Let me ask you this question
Let me interrupt and ask you this question
I'm trying not to interrupt
And I'm trying not to scream
Into my mic anymore
These are things that we notice
As we're watching the former season
So I'm going to try to
Be more professional this way
Rob, you're
Just tell the group
You were not a class
You didn't study
This when you were young
You're coming at this new
And yet you're
Diving into the language
I'm going to make you dive into the
Latin now
