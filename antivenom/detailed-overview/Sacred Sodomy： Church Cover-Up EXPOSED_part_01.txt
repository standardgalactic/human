reveals ritual abuse to be a consistent, brutal, and highly effective means of indoctrination. According
to our ancient sources, if you were a Christian priest living in the earliest era of the church,
you knew what had to be done. Nothing was more merciful in the long run. Remove the masses of
unfortunate orphan children from the streets a few at a time and prepare them for salvation.
Starve them. Recite creeds to them with a steady droning persistent repetition and then gather
them together into the secret chamber a place that only priests were allowed to frequent. A place
where the devil could be summoned. A place where priests could forever purge them of their desire
for sexual intimacy. It may be hard for a modern audience to understand but in the early centuries
of the common era salvation was no joke. Original sin was a doctrine that non-christians ignored and
even mocked but exorcists priests took it very seriously and were specially trained to brood it
out. Every good Christian knew that young boys, particularly orphan children without the protection
of living parents, were susceptible to sexual impurity, something that would drag their souls
directly to hell. The only way to purge this impulse, the only way to save their souls was to
force them to undergo a sacred ceremony, a mysterious initiation that would forever cleanse them of
inappropriate sexual desire and deliver them to Christ.
