initiation, precisely because they had not been born again into the way and their natural inclination
was to defend the demons they worshipped. In short, pagans were considered to be of the
spirit of antichrist and not to be trusted with the secrets of initiations.
Young boys taken from the streets of large urban centers were prepared over a period of weeks
for their catechesis. Priests enforced a rigorous series of fast and constant indoctrination.
This reinforced repetition of Christian doctrine was the reason the process came to be known as
catechesis, which is just a Greek word for placing doctrine into the ears of novitiates. In Latin,
catechesis is transliterated as indoctrination. After weeks of starvation and repetitive indoctrination,
children deemed ready for the initiation ceremony were taken to an out-of-the-way chamber or location
where they were sequestered from the general population of novitiates. In the first step
of the process of initiation, priests removed all of the clothing of these boys. If the children
showed any evidence of being ashamed to stand before a group of priests naked, Cyril commanded
that they be reminded that Jesus was himself crucified without his clothing. They had no need
of embarrassment to stand as Jesus stood naked before the world. In Cyril's own words from his
mystagogical catechesis, as soon as you entered, you took off your tunic. Once you had taken it off,
you were naked. What a wonderful thing. You were naked in the eyes of all and felt no shame.
