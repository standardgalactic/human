Then, once you had removed your clothes, you were anointed with exercised oil from the top
most hairs of your head to the lowest parts of your body.
After disrobing the children, the priests blindfolded them and then explained that their
actions were a necessary step in protecting the children from the gaze of the devil.
Next, the priests rubbed the boys generously with a sacred oil, the sacred oil like the anointing
oils also used by the Christians contained drugs that would undoubtedly facilitate the process of
exposing the children to the temptation offered by Lucifer. In short, it would numb them to the
burning fires of the devil. Following Cyril's instructions, priests supplied the oil to the
boys from the crown of their heads to the soles of their feet. It was an important priestly duty
to ensure that the children were completely covered and that the holy oil was rubbed into the
skin thoroughly. After all, it served as a barrier for their own protection and once it was applied,
the boys were forever consecrated to Christ. Cyril delights in this particular detail of the
ritual and speaks about the necessity of rubbing the entire body with oil.
Naked Oiled Children
Once the children were prepped in this manner and knelt in the hidden recesses of the church,
naked blindfolded and covered with oil, the exorcists then proceeded to summon the devil.
