Once Lucifer had been summoned, he made his presence known to the initiates.
They heard his voice and became terribly afraid. The boys were then commanded to rebuke the devil
while facing him. Then they were told to turn their back to him. At this point,
the possessed exorcist applied the fires of temptation. Cyril forbade this knowledge from
becoming public, lest the pagan world misinterpret it and cause criminal trouble for priests.
What we do know about the fires of temptation is that at least one Christian author reveals them
as the act of sodomy. In other words, the Prince of Darkness, the author of the first
temptation, while inhabiting the body of an exorcist, forced prepubescent boys to submit
to anal intercourse. The devil was said to have done this in a violent manner, but the children
were allowed to suffer the temptation forced on them by the possessed exorcist because this
afforded them an opportunity to rebuke the pleasure of the sin and thus obtain salvation.
The priests who were present during the application of the fires of temptation
encouraged the children to flee the sexual advances of the devil and they were told that
they should not enjoy the experience. The priests helped the children to call upon the name of the
Lord to see past the pain of temptation to the relief of salvation. When the devil was present
applying the sexual temptation, the boys were told to rebuke him in the name of Jesus.
