Even the Romans, Mr. Professional Army, right
Even they could, you know, were no match
For these tribes, these horse cultures
That are living around the Black Sea
Some of what you're called the amazonia, right
The amazones, the amazons, the amazons, right
What do we know the amazons do?
We know that they cauterize one breast
Why do the girls cauterize one breast?
Hippocrates says down below
He says their mothers cauterize their breast
Right, their right breast
Why is that?
Because, you know, when you're jumping around on a horse
At Gallop, which is, this is what these girls can do
They can jump around, move around the horse
As the horse is galloping
And they can sit and shoot you from your front
While they're running at a full speed away from you
They can shoot you while running away
That's fantastic
How can you get beyond that?
Wow, that's incredible
Wait a minute, what happens when they become virgins?
There's, right, now you see how terrible my students
You should see how terrible is that translation
For Parthenos's virgin
No, when they become of age
They'll start having children, right
What do they do?
What do they do?
They have to kill three enemies
Once they get three enemies killed
Then they can take a man
It doesn't say they can enter into a marriage
It says they can take a man
They can take someone after they've killed three people
Have to kill three
It's a sacrifice, right?
It's part of the sacrifices that must be made
You talk about human sacrifices, right?
Sometimes in the performance of the mystery
There has to be an understanding of the nature of the sacrifice
And if our young women
Who are going to be producing the future generation
If they are not properly sanctified
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
We don't need any of this, right?
All of this is brought to us as we saw last week
From the microphone by the bow
By that bow
With its poisons
I wanted you to see in the...
Go ahead and put up
Yeah, that's pretty much...
I just wanted to see the next paragraph of that work
He talks about the cauterizing of the breast
And that process of doing it
So, what an amazing, amazing figure
Just stop for a minute and say we stepped out of our ship
We're in the late Bronze Age
And we see one of these people from this tribe
This special tribe that lives around
You know, the Sea of Azov
Yeah, Lake Miotis
Let's see what one of these citizens
You know, for lack of a better word
And that's my word
I'm not giving them that because they didn't talk like that with each other
One of their kind
One of their ethnicity
Let's see what she's like
Let's pull her out and see what she's like
Well, we have a very nice example
That is given to us
Is given to us by a fellow who guarded the sibling books
The sibling books
And everybody's going to say right away
Oh, yes, the heart of Rome
The prophecies, right
All this stuff is written in
No, it's not even the right language you're looking at, right?
Okay, remember, follow the drugs
If you ever get lost, put your hand out
Grab that rope, it's on the side of a cave
And follow the drugs
Follow the drugs
We're going to go to she who was called by Dracontius
Isn't that a nice name?
Dracontius
It means Mr. Dragon
She who is called by Mr. Dragon
Scytha
Scytha
