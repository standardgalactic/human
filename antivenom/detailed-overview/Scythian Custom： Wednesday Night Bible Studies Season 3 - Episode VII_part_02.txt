It's our word for the Scythians
Wait a minute, you mean there was one woman
Who was called Scytha
Yeah, and Medell
Who the Median people call themselves after the Medes
Yes, my God, they called her Scytha
Isn't that nice?
They had a verb, scuthizo
Meaning to shave your head
They had to take your scalp, right?
It was proof
If you're going to want to enter into marriage
You have to have some kind of, you know
You got three, are you sure?
It was a big battle, a lot of confusion
You got to show what your worth is
Who is this person?
Let's see her
Let's see who the Medea is
Now, from Valerius Flaccus
I want to go to our second text
But before we do, I just want to tell you
This is a place for the education
So remember that we always have to go to the sea
For that education
Remember who we are
We are farmers
We are fisher people
We are people who range
And migrate and found cities, colonize
And we are people who
Who live on horseback
We're people who become one with that horse
And that horse is something very, very important
That horse is so important
That you see that horse right into the Parthenon
You're thinking, oh my god, what class is this thing?
What does it have to do?
This is too Eastern
Well, it has everything to do with you morons
Look at the Parthenon
Why is she who she is?
Why is there the association of the horse?
Why do we have this divine virgin?
You guys realize we worship this divine virgin, right?
I'm going to show you that divine virgin's most potent drug
Her most potent drug
But we have to start in the sea
Where everything starts
Bring us a sea
Yeah, bring us to a teaching about the sea today
Go ahead
Remember what this F-I-S-H word spells?
Fish
Put the fish right under the sea
There's the fish swimming under the sea
Now you can read the word fish
As you can tell, the Mycenaean Greeks were getting their drugs from under the sea
Yes, they're getting their purple from under the sea
Oh, we gotta love this
Okay, let's bring up...
I want to bring up Gaius Valerius Flakis
And as we're going there, I want you guys to look at this
Your text has a couple of different differences than mine does
I'm using what I consider to be a better text
But there's a couple of minor changes
But this is a good...
Here's a good breakdown of a short passage that comes to us from Gaius Valerius Flakis
I want you to remember now he has access to those sibling books
Okay, so he's...
You could say a...
The last pair of eyes that was on our subject
Right, those mysteries
Embodied in that...
Dactylic hexameter
Yes, those mysteries are buried within the prophecies of the Sibyls
You thought it was Latin, didn't you?
No
Love it
Bring it up
Bring it up
So remember, he's got access to this material
That's the past
And the future in the present
That's how that oracle works
And the last eyes to have this
That we have something surviving from
Our Gaius Valerius Flakis
Who was one of the Quindec and Weary
He was one of the 15 people who guarded these books
One of the 15
Now, you know, some...
Later they disappeared
Destroyed, possibly, possibly spirited off
Possibly hidden somewhere up the backside of some...
