Templar
Did you know, really quick, the devil won't mind this
Really quick, did you know those Templars?
In the trials they talk about
They're interviewing some of the...
Yeah, thanks, Chewie
Chewie's chairman, Chewie loves the Templars
Yeah, did you or did you not say the documents?
The Inquisition documents
Did you or did you not?
Lick the tip of the male member
Or the anus of your superior
Come on, people
How many of us have been in that situation?
How many of us have been there?
Yeah, it was purple because it had that drug on it, right?
The Templars had that purple cross in their shorts, right?
Stop, it's not that
A purple cross in your shorts, right?
Why would you have a purple cross in your shorts?
Because they're using that burning purple
Which we'll see, referred to here in this passage
You're gonna love this
Okay, so remember, we're in the cult environment
We just stepped out of our ship
We're watching it, we're sitting
You have a front seat right now
To Ancient Coal
What's going on?
Okay, let's see it, let's do it
I'm gonna read from my good copy, here
Okay, love it
And we begin
Yes, yes, give me a second here
Where did I...
A russus that I'm on, I'm proud to be here
We were Galdens, Matins, Chewie and Mori
Well, it's my order, there we are
My order, Precator Carmina
She prays these greater prayers
My orders, Hecaten, Inmitera, Willis
She prays that Hecates send into her
Greater Willis
What are Willis?
Greater Powers
Greater Powers
Yes, what are these powers?
On a very practical side
We're talking about the capacities of drugs
And this language is used on the medical side
You're about to get hit
With half a dozen medical terms
We're talking about the powers of drugs
Whether or not drugs have been adulterated
Oh my God, you classicists out there
You guys...
You gotta get this together, man
This is our chance
Our chance
Whose chance is this?
This is the muses' chance
Get your act together
Look at what we're doing
She prayed that Hecate would send these powers now
Into herself
Yes, and that she could stand there
She stood there, you know, contenta
Neck contenta, not...
Not happy, right?
Not satisfied
Not satisfied with what?
Nottis winanis
With the poisons that are known
The known poisons, right?
These are the poisons that
You and I would have access to
That we would know about
And she's not satisfied with those
She wants those ones that are in development
She wants those ones that are deep
That you can't get to
Unless you've been initiated
Do you remember what we read about Medea?
That she is that priestess who initiates?
Oh, now we get to see her
Now we get to see Sita
In action, the Scythian queen
We get to see her in action, right?
You say, wait a minute, no, her ethnicity
She's part Greek, right?
Whatever, right?
Whatever, dude, right?
Can you see her?
Let's see what she does, right?
I think she's Libyan
