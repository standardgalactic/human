I think she probably has some Greek relations
She's got families, she's got royal ties
So, yeah, lots of stuff
But she's prophesying from Thera
Everybody remember all you classes
Remember that she's prophesying from Thera
Pindar saved that
Her own prophecy
She is the first Oracle people
Wow, before it all blew up
That's gorgeous, gorgeous
Anyway, let's keep going
So what does she do?
In a very unusual line
Yeah, what her?
Wait a minute, who?
Where's the main verb here, right?
Where's the main verb here?
Jump down a couple of lines, right?
Look at Promet
She brings out from
What do you do when you promise something?
You produce it from one place to another, right?
And that can include a process
These are all words that are used
In conjunction with the making of medicines
So it doesn't surprise us that she promised
She produces from her sinus
Wait, what?
She produces from her sinus
Yeah, yeah
After it is
abrasively rubbed round
Yeah, she produces what?
The Caucasian flower
The flower of the Caucasus
Isn't that nice?
What is that?
She produces it
It's a flower
That she produces from
the Sanguinis
From the blood of Prometheus
Yeah
From the blood of Promethean what?
Not just Prometheus himself
From the blood of the Promethean fibra
Fibra, do we have a fibra up here?
Where's a fibra?
Here we go
Look at this, baby, what is a fibra?
Or a filament, that's nice
Look at number two, the entrails
The entrails, now
For those of you who want to take the extra step
The philologist, look at the very top
We're in that second set of lines
It says a fibra, filament, and a plant
And part of an animal's body, et cetera
And it says CFnerus
CFnerus, see the nerus
What is the nerus? It is also a fibra
Or a senu, or a tendon
Right? And he tells us
It's that thing that is stretched out
It's that thing
That is stretched out, that tendon
Or nerve
Right?
Yeah, yeah
What do we have here?
What do we have here?
Look at that, there we go, thanks
Look at
B here, people
Right, look at B here
You see that little Latin expression
Membrum virile
Yeah, what is a fibra?
What is a nerve?
It is that tension that is stretched
When we are going into
the orgasmos
Yes, it is the
Membrum virile
That just means the male
member in Latin, which is
their fancy
avoidance way of saying
penis
Yeah, that's a penis
Right
So, what does she do?
She collects from her sinus
that flower
