Is using her own body
In case you didn't notice, she's using her own
Body to produce
This drug
That it becomes the linchpin
Of everything
Nothing can happen without it
Yes, and it's connected with the purple
It's connected with the purple
For those of you, I've got a rush
I can hear the dogs
Beginning to bark
But anyway
Hekate
Showed this to her assistant
To her assistant
