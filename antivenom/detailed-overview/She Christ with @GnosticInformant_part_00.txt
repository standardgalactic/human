Έχουμε χρόνο με τον Ιησού,

Πήγαμε στον πόνο,

Αυτό είναι το προσπαθό μου,
να σας πρέπει να εξεχθεί με όλα τα αυτοκρατικά μου.
Ελπίζω να σας βρήσετε στον Ιησού.
Ευχαριστώ να σας πρέπει να σας εξεχθεί.
Εμείς θα έχουμε αυτοκρατική αυτοκρατική,
σε κάποιες μετατές.
Και όταν κάνουμε,
θα μας σημαίνει με ένα κομπλο βρήμα,

Τώρα,illarό.
Ναι!
They call her the dragon queen, they call her the dragon queen, and she, she is the sister of Helen, she's the sister of a couple of gods, castor and Pollux.
She's the murderer of the king.
Now, what happens in the short? He comes back from the war. His name's Agamemnon, he comes back from the war.
And guess, guess who he steps up with? Cassandra. Cassandra, who's she? She's the Bacchic priestess who ran Troy.
All of her oracles come true. She's cursed though. Nobody ever listens to her. So she can spout this stuff all the time.
Agamemnon comes back and outsteps Cassandra and she tells him, you big dummy, you brought me here, I'm going to get killed and you're going to get killed.
And why does she say that? Because it's Clytemnestra we're talking about, the dragon queen.
Do you know what? I'm going to show you what she does here in a minute with a classical text.
But do you know what her family is known for? Her sister Helen now, for the Satanic congregation, I want to say this is for you.
People don't go around talking about this kind of stuff. But the Greeks, if you dig deep enough, somebody, right?
Oh my God. Well, they talk about what Helen actually did. Helen was Medea and she went to Egypt and she cast her image to Troy.
And why Achilles? Come here Achilles. People don't know this. People don't know this. I'm going to show you some Greek in a second. Just wait.
Achilles, come here. You know why he gets a spanking? Because he ends up in Lusus.
In the fields, the Elysian fields, he ends up there as the groom of Medea. What happened to him?
What happened to him? Let's watch the magic of the Christing that they're entering.
Now, Kleidemnestra, remember, what does she do? What if we pull playback, the film? What does she do? It's all digital? What? Run it back.
Oh, look, Agamemnon steps in. He's getting a bath. Totally oblivious. She wraps him up in a rug. Really fine. Really fine rug.
And then she buries an ax in his brain. Now, remember, who are we talking about? We're talking about Bronze Age women.
Women like the Scythians who are spreading the burning purple, who are creating the Medusa.
Those women who have to kill three men before they can mate, they're running things.
They're running things. You should have seen the Spinks, man. We have to give her virgins.
Sorry, son. Oh, stop crying. You may have fun.
Her wrapping him up and cutting his brain, splitting his head open, that's not necessarily surprising.
Now, we're talking about Bronze Age women.
We're talking about Bronze Age women.
We're talking about Bronze Age women.
We're talking about Bronze Age women.
The people executing that. This is their history.
Now, I'm going to show you what she does. Does anybody want to see what the She-Christ does?
Does anybody want to see what Clytemnestra does?
I'm going to have a couple of women for you tonight and some things that they do.
I want you to notice the overlap. When you find that criss-cross, that radiation is the history coming through.
It's the anthropology coming through the language. Who doesn't want that?
Who doesn't want Mother Greek to caress them? Who doesn't want that?
You know what, those Spartans?
We Athenians, look, there's two things. I forgot to tell you guys this last time.
There's two things that we've learned so far. When you and I go into the past and we're looking at these people, you need to remember two things.
Number one, we don't bend the knee to the tyrant. We don't. You don't get down and worship something human. Don't do that.
Number two, we Athenians know that the word for buttocks, that were proctology from it.
We know that that's because of the Spartans who speak terrible Greek.
It's a reference to them engaging with the Canaitis because they developed that stuff down there.
Remember Jesus, the mountain, the Canaitis? That's a part. That's why we call it a proctos.
Can you feel the actual history of that? Why did nobody? Why did I have to find that on my own?
Why didn't somebody in a classroom somewhere at some time say, oh, and by the way, there's a Spartan history to this word, anus?
Yeah, yeah, fantastic. Fantastic. It's gorgeous, right? What did they figure out? Just one second to the Spartans in the group because I know you're out there.
I know some of you are descendants of Spartans. Tom was. Let me give a shout out to the Spartans for the fact that they were uncompromisingly worshippers of the gods.
Yes, fantastic. Your army of lovers. That was genius. You had to have some brains. The Athenians can't be totally right.
You had to have some brains because your army was interlocked, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
I wonder what would happen if we did that. What if we had an army? You know what happens?
You pull in a whole different dynamic because people are a lot more willing to find for their lovers, it turns out.
Isn't that strange? It's almost like it's a weapon. It's a secret weapon.
Quick, somebody send that to the generals up in the top. Give me the first overlay that we've got.
All right, people, I want to show you Clytemnestra. I want to show you.
The war is over. We know that the ships are coming back.
And what has Clytemnestra done? She set up all the altars in the city.
They're burning with the gifts of incense and I'm translating.
And here and there, she reaches up to Uranus. That's the way they had of describing very tall Amazonians.
You know, the daughters of men that ended up with the sons of God.
Okay, are you ready? So she's going around now.
I'm going to give you my translation, which is going to differ from modern or at least classically important translations.
And I'll show you one of them by Browning.
But I just want to give you my translation, right?
So here and there, this very tall, this very tall Amazonian.
What is she doing? She's waving her torches because these are night rites that the priests are involved in, right?
Oh, what time of the day is it? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
And does anybody know if you've been sitting here for any amount of time and you don't say, oh, right before the sunrise?
Yes. You realize, right? We caught her right in the act of the rites.
And what is she? Look at that fourth line down.
What kind of drugs are you ready for this?
Are you ready?
The royal drug that comes from her innermost recesses.
The holy Christing powered by that painkiller that causes us to be softened.
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing? What is she?
Is this typical?
Is this typical?
What do you mean by typical?
Do you think it's typical?
It's just a bit different.
What does she really mean by that painkiller that causes us to be softened?
Yeah.
Is that amazing?
What is she?
Τι this is typical?
Τι is this typical?
I'm going to Christ all over you.
I'm going to show you so much Christ tonight.
Okay. Let's just do it. Let's just charge it.
Now I'm going to come back to that passage because there's a lot going on there.
This just... it's just this, you know, it makes your soul just come alive.
So we're going to come back to it as we advance.

Παρακολουθούμε, όταν they say Enchanted Witch, they've taken you into the back alley.
Αυτό το εξαμπλίσμα, αυτό το εξαμπλίσμα είναι ένα αλληλόγιο στις your mental state.
Μπορείς να είσαι πασυφή, μπορείς να είσαι χοροφή.
Υπάρχουν όλες τα πράγματα που μπορείς να κάνουν.
Τα Μαγγία, they know how to question people under the influence of drugs.
They give you the drugs, you say whatever it is they want you to say.
Αυτό το εξαμπλίσμα, διότι είσαι παρακολουθείς, they have what the fear drugs especially.
Αυτό το εξαμπλίσμα, στις εξαμπλίσμα, they're putting the purple in their hair.
They're putting the purple in their hair.
They're offering their hair.
Τα Μαγγία, they have even found those offerings.
We have them.
This is history we're talking about people.
This is reality.
This is not some idiot trying to sell you a course on mystery religions.
This is reality.
Look, it's the text people.
It's what the text are saying.
It's a reason to be happy because look what we've uncovered.
Can you believe?
These women like Clytemnestra, they're scary.
They're scary and they're running everything.
They're running everything.
Oh, it's a good kind of scary though.
It's supposed to be scary, right?
Okay, give me the next one.
What kind of gods people did we come together if under Clytemnestra the dragon queen?
What kind of rights are we here?
We're here to protect the Astonomontheon.
We're here to honor the gods who guard the nomos,
who guard that gnome of the gods.
What does that gnome?
It's a nem.
And what does it mean when you nemo?
It means you bring my righteous retribution.
You bring my nemesis.
This is the law of the city.
These are the gods that Clytemnestra serves.
You mean, did that guy just say, where's the whip?
The whip's for me this time.
Did that guy just say something about a woman creating civilization?
Do you see?
Do you see what's happening?
Are you surprised that she chopped and put an axe in his head?
Come on, man.
She had already killed three men to get to that point.
What's the big deal?
It's justice, baby.
She was perfectly fine until he went south.
Perfectly fine.
Amazing.
Swift, give me the next one.
What are the gods that we worship here?
Clytemnestra, we...
Look at the second word, chthonion.
That chthonian divinity.
If you understand that, you understand who she is.
And what is the huppaton?
You know what that is?
That's the highest.
That's the highest.
You mean, the septuagint.
The septuagint is somehow being influenced or influencing this.
It's the same culture.
This is the gods who are the highest.
The gods who are the highest.
Monism turns that into the god who is the highest.
But before there was a god who was the highest,
there were chthonian gods who were high.
Yeah, huppaton.
Give me the next one.
And finally, finally, what are we really doing there?
Look at these spirits, people.
I'm going to show you some spirits you've never seen before.
Are you ready?
This is Clytemnestra, and she's sacrificing these cakes
that are...
The air is full of this stuff.
I mean, it's really...
It's too much.
Okay, stop.
The fumigation, I get it.
What gods are we worshiping?
We're doing this for the gods of the city.
We're doing this for the agorion.
You're never going to have heard of these gods, guarantee ya.
They're the gods of the agora.
They're the gods of that public commerce that you and I can have
when we don't try to murder each other.
And by the way, as Athenians,
do you know what kind of police force we have?
We have Scythian archers.
Scythian archers, brah.
Yeah.
Yeah, we do.
And we respect the law.
We have giant juries with hundreds of people in them
making obnoxious noise.
Yes, deciding our fate.
It's democracy.
Can you believe that?
Where's Jesus?
Jesus is not here yet.
Where's Jehovah?
There is no Jehovah at this time.
I want you to realize that.
And Neil is going to have a clip of a scholar.
And while he plays that scholar,
and that scholar says what he says,
I'm going to be sitting in the background going,
ha, ha, he.
That's what I'm going to be doing.
And maybe, I don't know, something else.
And the problem is,
this is the kind of thing that we need to do to bust out
of the Bible
and to reclaim it.
To reclaim it.
A lot of people, people didn't believe me.
I told you, we're going to be teaching the Bible.
Right?
And they even have a way for us to do it.
You know how lucky those teachers are in Oklahoma?
If I were a teacher in Oklahoma right now,
I'd be like, all right, I got it.
I'm there for you.
I'll teach my class the Bible.
I'll teach your class the Bible.
I'll teach everybody here the Bible.
And we're going to start in the Bible
from the time Jesus Christ was arrested
in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked kid.
Mark 14, 51 and 52.
That's who this is brought to you by.
The Bible.
We are so lucky people.
The Bible is so full of dirty, dirty stuff.
It's the most dirty.
It's the most dirty.
I look at people and I think,
do you actually know what's in there?
Most people don't because they don't read the Greek.
They think the original is this terrible liturgical,
tiny, tiny vocabulary language that's absolutely terrible.
Right?
But it's terrible. You can't convey.
