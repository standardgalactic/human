a claim of that
sort of or any claim about
when let's say a biblical text was written
the first question
that I'll ask is
how do you know that
and I expect
an answer that's compelling
the answer can't be
well most scholars
think that whatever
I will continue and I will ask
well how do these scholars know that
in good
historical work
you need to show
evidence for any claim that you make
I'm simply trying to put
on the table
what it is that we know
what it is that we don't know
I look backwards in time
start with the first century of the common era
and go backwards to the first century
before the common era
to the second century before the common era
to the third century before the common era
prior to this time
the trail of evidence ends
we no longer find archaeological evidence
or textural evidence
which point to widespread
observance of the Torah
or in fact any kind of observance
of the Torah in actuality
the fact that we don't have any references
to any of the biblical texts
stories, laws
did it pause? I didn't pause it
I could continue with
though I got the clip right here
go ahead it's probably on our end
alright because the last part
is pretty good
was it playing?
down in the 700
or textural evidence
which point to widespread
observance of the Torah
or in fact any kind of observance
of the Torah in actuality
the fact that we don't have any references
to any of the biblical
texts, stories, laws
the fact that we have
practices which go against
which contravene
the Torah law
for example we find
images of Athena
these are copies of
Greek coins
we find them being minted in Judea
with
the term, the name Yehud
the name of the Judean province
I find
in my discussions with scholars
often times people just
they don't get what I'm doing
right to me it seems so obvious
but it's not
clear to them
that this is a
question that we can
look into and
investigate and think about
what are ordinary people doing
to me it's the simplest question
of all the earliest evidence
that we have for the
Torah being observed
is from the middle of the 2nd
century before the coming of Europe

now the reason why this interview
is a little bit different
and it has better information I think
because it's worse
than we thought, it's worse than I thought
because here and we didn't even
talk about this but it's in his book
he writes this in his book

Could you answer it all?
Was it refreshing to get somebody who's standard was evidence, right?
The theology and all that stuff, no that stuff matters, right?
The dude is digging in the dirt by the way somebody just sent me an article that they
found a ring, a gold ring, and hypha.
And it had the imprint of Minerva on it, right?
Θα ήθελα να γνωρίζω τι είχα σκέψει.
Είχα σκέψει και έγινε ότι είσαι πραγματικά.
Είχα σκέψει καλύτερα.
Δεν υπήρχε Μόζος.
Αυτή η στιγμή που έγινε was there.
Δεν υπήρχε Μόζος.
Είναι ένα τελευταίο δημιουργείο.
Λοιπόν, ναι.
Λοιπόν, κάποιες βιβλότητες θα γνωρίζουν να γνωρίζουν
ότι Μόζος...
Τι σημαίνει ότι Μόζος δεν είναι around 450 BCE.
Είναι πολύ δύσκολο στην their opinion.
Αλλά δεν είναι around 450 BCE.
Και έχουν Αθήνα στον their coin.
Δεν έχουν Μόζος στον their coin.
Έχουμε Άμβριο Λέγκη στον our coins.
Δεν έχουν Μόζος και Αμβριχάνο στον their money.

Ζούς, κομμάτιχε τον fucking Eagle.
Και they've worshiped the zodiac of Ion.
Λοιπόν, they do.
It's in the synagogues.
They're sitting there, right?
By the way, synagogues is a Greek word.
You've got to think about that for a minute.
You know what I mean?
It's amazing.
Have you, as you're doing all this research,
and as you're pulling down all of the views of the late Bronze Age
and then down Iron and then finally the classical Greece,
are you getting some kind of picture of movements of people
in this, you know, basically a sea-based world, right?
And you've got movements of people throughout this area.
And some of those people are going through the, you know,
what you call Judea, right?
Or Palestine, people are going through them.
Those people have Greek.
They do have, there's Greek blood all over the place.
There's Greek genetics all over.
Even the Phoenician punics are Mediterranean to the core.
I mean, they have a different language.
They're Semitic people, of course.
They're using the same alphabet,
but they have their own way of,
they have their own, I guess you could say,
it's like a font if you think about it.
Because it's all the same alphabet.
It's the alpha-beta.
But they have their own pantheon of equivalents,
of chronos, of Zeus,
and they have, they have all their,
they have Ashmon, who they say,
and this, there's actually,
they have a, we found a bilingual text.
It's in, it's half punic and half Greek or Latin.
It's Latin, actually.
Is it Latin?
I think it is.
It's one of those two.
But one of them has a donus
and the other one has Ashmon.
And it's like, so that you could see
how they're like equating those gods together.
Anyways, but it's a bilingual text.
It's like the, it's like the, um,
but I wanted to mention to them
about the Dan, the Dan in the beginning of that clip.
They always say this.
We, we, we scholars think that Moses
was being written down around the 700s.
Why?
This is what I want to know.
Why 700s?
Why not 900s?
Why not a thousand?
Because it's the same thing to me.
You're just guessing.
You're just making shit up with no evidence
and just going, it's possible.
That Moses just slipped through the cracks
and that no one figured out who he was
until the Hellenistic period.
And that all, there's only a small group of,
of, of elitist people in Jerusalem
who wrote about Moses.
Why are they writing about Moses
and not telling anybody?
What the hell is the point of that?
It's a very, it's a very weird.
So it's me and Derek.
We're talking about this.
We're calling it the Torah of the gaps argument.
You ever heard of the God of the gaps argument?
So people who, people who wrote about Moses
So people who, people who try to argue
about like God being in control of everything
will say like, oh, they used to think
rain was sent by the gods.
Now they know rain is, is, you know,
is caused by condensation or whatever.
And so like God kind of moves back into the areas
that we don't know where he is, right?
So now it's just like, he's outside of space and time.
Monism, right?
They do the same thing for the Torah.
Wherever we, if we look for the Torah,
we'll look for evidence of the Torah
or stories about Moses or just anybody
writing about Moses or Abraham or anything.
Just mentioning Abraham or Noah.
You can't find it.
It's just not there.
So it becomes this thing of,
it becomes this argument of the Torah of the gaps
where we can't find them.
The average Joe doesn't know who Moses is.
The farmer doesn't know who Moses is.
The soldiers don't know who Moses is.
So it must just be some really small priestly class
sitting up in Jerusalem by themselves,
writing legends for nobody but themselves.
It sounds crazy.
It does.
It does.
And that was the only beef I had with your guest.
Was that he said, you got to realize,
and as soon as you hear him generalizing, you know,
they're going to mess up.
By the way, the best scholars can fall into this trap.
So I'm not saying this dude is an excellent scholar.
He sounds like it to me.
Yeah.
And I was really impressed with how he handled evidence.
So, but when he's generalized,
and it's easy to step in this trap,
when he generalized and was talking about,
well, you know, in antiquity,
books were just for the elite, right?
And you had to have a lot of money
and a lot of hoo-ha and a lot of education.
Anyway, when we say that, I thought,
what do you think that gymnasia were?
They were teaching people a homework.
A theater.
You explain your kids to school
to learn Homer's grammar.
What do you mean?
There were 50,000,
50,000 scrolls
in the Alexandrian library.
Who do you think is reading all those scrolls?
You think it's just a few elite people?
That's an old argument
that I've heard in classics for the longest time.
But here's the thing though.
And it doesn't stand up.
I totally am fine with the idea
that only a very select can read and write.
Even if that's the case, let's grant that.
Fine.
It doesn't matter
because they can still tell the stories to people.
So you still have the theater,
you still have Homer being played out
as a song for people who can't read and write
to listen to.
So even if that's true,
that only a small certain people can read and write,
it doesn't mean they're not going to be able
to tell people's stories.
People want to know stories.
People are sitting around at campfires every single night.
They don't do anything else.
So if there's a legend somewhere about some hero,
they're going to want to know about it.
There's no way that's not going to get out there.
It just doesn't make sense at all
that people would secretly have their own little secret clicks
of legend writing.
That just doesn't make any sense.
No, no.
And let's remember it's not all the Greeks
because the Spartans were the...
was their Greek bad,
but they tried to outlaw stuff like theatrical performances
and reading and stuff like that.
The Spartans were far more like modern evangelicals
than the evangelicals realized.
If you think about how their culture was
and how they viewed people in the world,
what their big view was, you want to say world view.
