I let that liquor drown in my haze Now I'm taking my last ride
I paid the highest price you can pay I'm on my way to Potter's Field
A Palmer's Grave is where I'll be To rest until the end of time
For all eternity
Welcome back to Lady Babylon. This is Satanic Initiation, and we are going to go to the dark tonight.
We are going to the darkest place that we've been so far. Many of you may be disturbed by the Bible,
but we are going to cover it. We're going to bring this Bible to you.
We kicked down the doors. We took control of our text, and we're going to throw it out there.
We're going to see the daughters of Lot tonight on Lady Babylon.
I appreciate everyone coming out. I'm not going to waste a minute of your time because we've got a place to go that's deep.
For those of you who may have some reservations about certain topics that are sensitive,
I just want to warn you, the Bible is extremely explicit. I'll be translating it to you tonight in the most explicit detail possible,
brought to you by the language itself. We love this, don't we?
Yes, but in order to set the mood, I wanted you to go and see some women. Let's call these women furies,
and in the midst of these furies is the chorus, greed stains your soul with the stench of ruin.
Today's rites are about purification. Let us start off with the purification brought for the crime of greed.
It's only what you invest in the kingdom that is going to benefit you for eternity.
They thank you, thank you, thank you for getting that money out of my pocket.
Fantastic. That has the images that you've now downloaded. We're sitting on that throne and we are ready to go.
Where am I going to take you tonight? I'm going to take you to a place called Sodom.
