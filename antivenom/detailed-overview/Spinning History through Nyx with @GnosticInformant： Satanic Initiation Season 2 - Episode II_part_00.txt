Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met, I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace, where is that hawk called destiny
I think she ran on without me
Welcome back to Lady Babylon's satanic initiation
We have some announcements before we begin tonight
I'd like to say we're going to have a new feature called testimonials
And how we'll do that is I will contact you and I will talk to you for 60 seconds
And you will answer the question, how did reason give you satanic freedom?
How did reason give you the unassailable freedom?
If I can get 60 seconds of your take, I think we can see each other here a lot better
I really enjoyed talking to you and getting to know you
Tonight we have the privilege of summoning the ghost of a dead man twice
Gnostic informant will be joining us immediately following the summoning
We look forward to it
Alright, let's get started here
I'm going to show you a very short little video here that I've put together
With another great song from Zane Campbell
But before I do that, I just want to introduce you to somebody named Hormotimus
Who is this guy Hormotimus?
His name means honor of Hermes, right?
Isn't that nice? Hormotimus
So of course that's where we begin
You need to see him
And what I dug out for you from the corpus metachorum grichorum
It's in a section on Ammon's notes
I rather like that
And iatromathematics
I want to show you that source now so that we can visit with a dead devotee of Hermes
Yes, and so that we can understand the initiation
Yeah, fantastic
Let's go ahead and bring this up
No, let's go ahead and start with the video
Actually, go back, yes, I'm sorry, we should do the text first
Text first, yes
So this is, I'm just going to translate this to you quickly, reading it off my screen to you
Yeah, so these things are said about Hormotimus
Yeah, the chlasmenian
Yeah, they say that his soul was separated from his body and went around, you know, a long time
And was able to locate itself in different places and to prophesy
Or to tell the things that were about to happen to the people there
For example, he could talk about whether it was going to flood or whether there was going to be
No flood whatsoever, maybe drought
Whether there was going to be some kind of seismic activity or whether there was a plague coming
Yeah, such things, you know, such things
Now he did this with his body laying there
Yeah, they say his soul came back into his body like it was a sheath
And it revived the body
Huh, yeah, so he would do this thing quite frequently
And he told his wife, certain commands that when he was going into the separation
That she shouldn't touch any part of his body
And she shouldn't let anybody else of the citizens, the locals, don't let them touch it
And certainly not any other men
But these guys came into his house one day and they were pushing his wife
And she showed him, and there he was lying on the floor naked
Totally motionless
So what'd they do?
They picked up fire and they totally burnt his body
You know why?
Because they thought since his soul had separated
It wouldn't be able to return
And that his life would reach its ending
And yeah, so it happened
Now the class of minions, even up to today
When you and I are talking
They reverence
They're motionless
They even built a temple for him
Yeah
And then they forbid that any woman should ever enter it
Because of what I just told you
There are going to be images here
Which I need you as the congregation to be absorbing
To be taking in
Pythagoras said, Hermotimus was his previous
Was his previous incarnation
Yeah, that his soul, Psyche, was the same
So this fascinating art
Of being able to project oneself across time
And space outside of a corporeal form
To the extent that you can
Your Adolon actively appears
And teaches the future
You know, this is Pythagoras, you know
Right up, he's on it
And he's right in the Saturnian gap
And that's where we need to be in that Saturnian gap
We have somebody tonight in that gap
Coming on in just a minute
Yeah, yeah, so I wanted you to
I really wanted you to ground yourselves tonight
Let's watch this video
And then discuss a couple of images
And immediately we'll introduce and bring on
Gnostic Informant
I've refined my tortures
Well, I'm my own inquisition
I have died a thousand times
A life in my petition
The prey upon my weaknesses
You have to know and take them
Where to stretch and pull and stab
Where the pain and fear is greatest
And I know my shame it walks with you
As constant as a shadow
It will never give me peace
It won't go till I go
The torture of the mind is worse
Than calm and sorrow of body
There is no sleep
And when it comes the nightmare is upon me
Horrible imaginings
Make just for me to suffer
My greatest dreads laid out again
Till death becomes my savior
Reason governs substance
That's what Hermitimus was contributing
That there is a quantum universe that exists
And that you can create within that universe
That it is mind
That acts upon the substance
Yeah, Hermitimus
That's quite revolutionary
Did they burn you?
Yes, they burned him
They burned him alive
It's a good thing
It makes you wonder what happened to him
As he was out
Because, you know, if he was like emphatically
You know, he could go to sleep
For 47 years, 56 years, whatever it was
Yeah, and come back
He could move through time like that
Yeah, these are the builders of your true civilization
Yeah, we are going to look at some hymns
But first, we're going to do it through Neil
So I would like to welcome, before Neil opens his mouth
I would like to introduce him as a new man
With regards to one thing
And one thing alone
Before he was goat feces, right?
But now he possesses a name
He possesses a name
That's right, he was able to work
He was able to work through the rites
He was able to skim them
Just with his own...
You know, I wasn't going to do it for him
And to be honest, Neil, I got to tell you
Your final find, I did not think you would make it by tonight
I didn't, I was dreading
I was like, I don't think so
After the pseudo-nix thing, you didn't have the faith in me after that?
Yeah, I knew that
