I don't know how many words are in that hymn
100 maybe, 200 somewhere in between
And I went through every single one
Didn't find what he was looking for
What he told me to find
And I go, are you serious?
The one word that I found
What was it?
That's in my Texas to you
It was the one that had Aphrodite's girdle
And I thought you were messing with me
Because I thought I found it
And I thought you weren't telling me
Let's see which one
Where was that? Do you remember?
And I told him
And I told him a dozen times
I told him it's difficult
When you're in this window
Of opportunity
It's difficult to pull out the images
And the focus and the really
So I kept reinforcing with Neil
Ponta Cretor is one of them
Because that's all powerful
I'm like, is it that one?
You're like, no
You're lying to me
And then I found the one that was
Where is it?
The one about Aphrodite's girdle
And I was like, this has got to be it
I was like, there's no way
Amon would not make me find this word
This is too good
Because I was looking at what Alice said
About that word
And there was a ton of initiation
Cult stuff going on with that word
So I was like, there's no way
This isn't the word
And I started getting pissed
I was like, you're lying
And then he like, go through it again
Went through the whole him again
Word by word by word by word
And then I found it
I said his head
Of Hercules
And I'm looking at the English
And it said something about
Hercules' head brings out the light
And I was like, Lucifer
So then I found
Then I went back to the Greek
Where that passage was
And I found the word
It stuck out
It just also, I thought it was a phoros
Dasma phoros
Boom
And I texted you with the bam emoji
Bam, that little like star thing
Found it
And you were like, good work
You're like, let's do the show
And I was like
Yeah
Now you know the place
This helps me learn Greek though
All seriousness
Doing this
I'm looking up Greek words
I'm trying to pronounce them
I'm looking up what they mean
I learned like 20 new Greek words today
From doing this
So this was a very educational process
For me too
This wasn't just, you know
There's another side of this too
Useful
Absolutely
Yeah, now Neil
I wanted to ask you again
You had some dreams
And you're looking at night
And she is the mother
She's the mother of dreams
And I'm just wondering
What then images are you processing of night
As you're doing
As you're going through this process
I'm having
I've been having a reoccurring dream
A lot lately
And this reoccurring dream
And it happens in different ways
But it always ends up the ground opening up
And going down in some like
Underworld place
Whether it be like the one
The one time I had this dream
I was at a park
People playing music
It was like a party or something
And I was on it
I walked up a slide
Like a little kid would
They go down the slide
All of a sudden the ground opens up again
I'm like, oh this dream's happening again
I keep having this recurring
The ground sinkhole
Opening up
And everyone falling down inside of it
So that's one of the things
And I also wanted to ask you this too
What are the odds that
When you and I
A couple of months ago
Or a month or two ago
When we were looking for a secret word
That had to fit a certain gematria
What are the odds that that had
That turned out to be pseudo-nix
The image of nix
And this is all playing out like this
It's interesting
What do you think?
I never thought about it until today
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I'm right, Neil
And that's why I mentioned Hermotomus
Because he is that one
Like Jung was doing in that video
He's the one who is able to make that connection
Right?
He's the
You've been to the
You understand going into the deep night
In order to reach the dawn
Because we are dawn bringers, right?
And you understand the connection
With Lucifera
Right?
Lucifera
You understand that connection
So as you're feeling this
And as you're going
I hate to say meditating
Because it's just like
It's not
