No hints
He asked me
Repeatedly
And I told him
No
You have to pull it out
And he pulled
That yosferos
That dawn bringer
Literally
It's in the middle of the hymn
In a mirror formation
So that you can
Right
Because we use mirror magic
If
Since we have ears to hear
Neil has ears to hear
He knows what that means now
He knows how to go back to the text
And see
Oh
Foros seos
Right
Oh wait a minute
Right
There it is
Right in the middle
Staring you in the face
They're saying these
And I'm sure Neil
It's got to be
Back me up on this
What do you think
They said the song
The song of the medwa
Is more powerful
Than the drugs that are involved
That's what
Give me your reflection on that
Yeah
Because the song
Is what gets you into the
And it gets you into that
Like the Pythagoreans
Knew what they were doing
When they were putting together
The eight string chords
And they knew what they were doing
They were fine tuning
The sounds
And making sure that
That song puts that person
Into that trance
Into that mode
To get in that energy
The mania
To get into that revelry
So it's more important
To be there
Than to take the drug
Taking the drug by itself
Doesn't do
Is only half the book
That's nothing
The song is where it's at
The melody
The tune
The hymns
The frequency
That's the word
The frequency
So
Ask any Christian
Who goes to church
That their favorite part
Is the part where
They start singing
And dancing
That's the part
Where they feel the spirit
That's Orphic
So the physics
They're relying on
The physics are there
You know, set within the images
That their religion is pushing
So isn't it funny?
Do you get the feeling now
That this whole last two thousand
Year build up
Of accreted garbage
Has given us this faith thing
We go to church
We have the faith
Or we go through a certain number of steps
And then we have the faith
Do you see how that is not
The operation of the mystery
The operation of the mystery
Is the bringing of the individual
It's like taking a really good
Mom and Pop-owned restaurant
And then corporatizing it
And making it for like every city to have
Every city has a buffalo wings now
But the original buffalo wings
From the beginning days
Was the real authentic version
And it worked
It was a miracle
But all these other fake copycats
It's all just cook or cutty stuff
Eh
You get the little
You get a little bit of a
A little bit of a jolt from it
But it's not the real thing
It's just a copy
It's just a
It's like a ghost of our body
It's not the real things
It's a phantom
You can touch your
You can put your finger right through it
It's not real
You can't grab it
But this
The real mysteries
The real orific
Elysianian
Delphi Mysteries
Are the real deal
That's where all this is coming from
The Eucharist
Drinking the blood
And eating the body
The grain and the blood
The grape and the vine
And the grain
Demeter and Bacchus
Putting them into your body
Becoming Bacchus
By eating Bacchus
By eating the grapes
And drinking the vine
By eating the grain
The old ergot grain
That has been fermented
Taking in those gods
And becoming the gods
Becoming born dying
And rebirth
All those concepts
That you see with these religions
