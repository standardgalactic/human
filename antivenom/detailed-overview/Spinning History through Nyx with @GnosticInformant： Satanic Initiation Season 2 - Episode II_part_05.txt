That don't understand
Where they come from
Or why they're even doing it
That's why they're doing it
Because they took a process
That's been working
That has real magic and mania
And they're trying to
Multiply it
Times a million
And it loses its light
It's like taking that
First source of light
This is with the Gnostics
In fact, this is a
Sethian text that says
In the beginning
The Creator was a source of light
And then he begot two more lights
Those two lights had
A little bit more dim
And then those two lights
Begot more lights
And those lights were
A little bit more dim than that
And then after billions
And billions and trillions of years
You have these dim lights
Flying around creating stuff
And that's what
That's what Yalda Boat
Yahweh was
He was one of those dim lights
Who thought he was the
Thought he was the big light
But he wasn't
There really is
There's brighter lights than that
That's what the Sethians talk about
So do you think that
Do you think that impulse
Toward the open eyes
Do you think that desire
To like take a breath
Because you know
As you're going into it
And you're saying, okay
I'm gonna work myself up
In this initiation
How do I do it?
And I gotta do diet
And I gotta do, you know
I gotta regulate
And again, I think
This one is important
For entering that death state
I think it's important
For you to be really close
That way
And to do the, you know
Yeah, if you try to take ayahuasca
With a full stomach
You're puking it up
Yeah
You need at least 24 hours
At least with no food
And if you're gonna eat anything
I think this is interesting
If you're gonna eat anything
They say eat some grapes
Now I think that's interesting
Because what is it
What is grapes?
It's bakis, the vine
The one thing that you can pop
You can put in your stomach
That's not gonna affect the mania
Happens to be bakis
The bakoi, the vine
Actually, I wanted to ask you about that
What do you think about that?
I was concentrating on
I'm getting on that necromancy
I'm always Neil
I'm always gonna air to the side
Of the necromancy
And I think when you put
When you starve yourself
You go ketotic
You enter into that state
Of contempt for the living
And that's what I was pushing
And you know, hey
If I was a little bit rough on you
With the stop eating
Because Neil writes to me
He says I'm eating grapes
And I'm like dude
You gotta stop
Right, stop
You gotta do this
We gotta do it right
This stuff is authentic
That's one thing I like about you, Neil
Is that you not only
Possess the name now
So I have to give you
A certain amount of respect
But you go all the way
You went all the way
You got that final word
I was like there's no way
He's getting it
There's no way, right
I'm taking bets with the devil
I'm like no, no, no
He's not gonna get it
Maybe tomorrow
It was close to nine o'clock
It was good a couple hours ago
You wanna show them to him
And where the word is maybe
Or do you not have
I can pull it up
Sure, yeah, yeah
Let's pull
Let's see if I got it online
Let's see
Yeah, work on that for a second
See if you can pull it
I got it
It's number 12
It's number 12 right here
Dude, it's this one
Derek, please
And he's gonna
It's around line
It's line 11
Okay, I found it
I got it
Let me share my screen
Yeah, and by the way
Yes, please, Neil
Thank you
And by everybody who's watching this
Realize that we are sitting
In the world's virtual museum
We have it
Our fingertips thing
I mean, I know you guys know this
But you need to understand
Why that's so impressive
And how fortunate we are
We should say thanks
So, I'm gonna read line 11
