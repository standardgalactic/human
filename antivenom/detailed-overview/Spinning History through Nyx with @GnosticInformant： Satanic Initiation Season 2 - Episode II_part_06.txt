As Neil puts that up there
You see it?
Yeah, horse, pericrati, forace, A.O.
Cae, nucta, melanin
And I told you, Neil
I told you, right
Neil's having these dreams
About night
And I told him, it's with night
That you'll find
Right?
It's with night
That you'll find
And look what he found
He found the dawn bringer
Yeah, why is she?
Neil, what does it mean
When it says that she
That night and dawn are
It literally says
Around the head
Imitating around the head
Of this
Heracles
And we thought Heracles
Was somebody else, right?
You thought he was myth
Fairy tale, blah, blah, blah
Right?
No, I'm talking with
Within the cult now
Neil knows a different Heracles now
Right?
He's a bowman, right, Neil?
Yeah
Yeah, down here
Yeah
Yeah
Right here, right?
Is the bow work?
And he's, and he's mantic
Yeah
Iobolois with his
Now remember, we saw that
You know, it was to the point
That out, guys
I did not know that before today
Now I can, now
I'm telling you that
What you did for me today
I'm able to, I'm able to
Look at some of these words
And point them out
Without even having
The English right next to me
Yeah
Okay, go ahead
Let me cut you off
Go ahead
No, that's okay
The Ioboloi, right?
Those are the shedders
Of the poison
Nero's him
Yeah
Nero got for the sacred formula
Right?
The poison shedders
Yeah
And so
Neil, tell me though
As you're working
These hymns over
And you're going through this
And you're, you're
You're attempting to break
Through that barrier
And you do
You reach something
You, you got that name
You pulled it out
I told you, calm down
You calm down
You cast out that demon
Who was calling me an SOB
Or whatever it was
It wasn't that
You know what I mean?
Yeah
But right, right?
And we got rid of him
As soon as we cast out that demon
Then you suddenly have access
You calm
And the very next text you sent me
Was the exact name
That I was looking for
From the hymn
What's the magic of that?
Tell me
Finding
To, to find that
That, that, that sacred name
That sacred title
So we know what really
What Hercules is
So it's the
Here's the here
For the people on the outside
They hear about Hercules
And his 12
He had his 12 labors
And he was very strong
And he, he went to
You know, he won
Every fight he was in
Yeah, that's great
Cool
But
The inner mysteries
The deeper, darker mysteries
For those who have ears to hear
Is that Hercules
Is the male Lucifer
But also is also
Who's also the female Diana
Very good
And you can feel comfortable
In that
You can feel comfortable
Perfectly comfortable
Satan's
Saturnian by gender
Doesn't bother you
It doesn't bother you
The devil as a sister
Lucifer and Lucifer
Lucifer
And they happen to be a dia
That they're one
It doesn't bother me
I like that
That's something to be proud about
That's something that's amazing
Right
Yeah
Isn't, isn't it remarkable that
That it aren't
How don't we switch, Neil?
How don't we switch our poles?
Where is it?
Right
How don't we switch to our poles now?
You suddenly have
Yeah
