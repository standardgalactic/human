prostitute also means to practice idolatry at the bottom the religion is just
wound up with it you can't separate the two a porno compost is one who has commerce with
prostitutes the roots of this are you know endless this is one source i wanted to see
to bring it look what do we have here we have hasekius now i'm going to give you i'm going to
give you something special right i'm going to give you something special tonight your average scholar
is not going to do this they're not going to go all the way into the depths what i have to do is dig
up a lexicographer who is greek an ancient greek lexicographer who's going to be able to write to
you what these words mean in his own language right that is evidence that is the cream of the
crop that is that bottle of wine that's been sitting there for 120 years yeah that's the good stuff
that's the good stuff let's go right now to him let's go here's two words
porno copos and porno which is just they're just putting some stuff into a case don't worry about
that it's just pornos anyway what is the porno copos it's the hetero trofos the hetero trofos
remember jesus has a tyroid these little guys who are his companions all the time this is the one
who grooms them this is the companion groomer and the pornos he is himself a pornos so when
jesus talks to his children and he is telling them about what they will be doing he is approaching
them as the groomer as the one who cultivates their active use as prostitutes he is the pornos
he's the if you want to think of him as the ideal pornos that's the way to go but that is
the position from which jesus is speaking to his young apostles okay um pornoi look at the
bottom definition paidi no this one i'm going to translate directly up for anybody who's been
saying these kids these kids are not not kids who were kids these are 30 year old kids right
and the only reason he's calling him kids is jesus is goofy right he walks around like mickey
mouse saying hello there kitty we're all my sheepkins today hello there lamekin he does that
to adults because he's just weird that way right it's just one of the things no no that's not right
that's not right at all
what is the definition according to hezekius hezekius yeah this is that pice
that has grown to the point of fruition to the point of fruiting that's literally what it says
that kid is at the point of blooming and at that point of blooming they are entered
into working for the telones the one who collects the fees and that one who collects the fees
is strictly working the business end of those um hamarthaloy yeah yeah okay let's keep going
