That's our context, right?
We already got off the ship.
We're standing here with Galen.
Every drug combo has a gospel.
Yeah.
Everyone has something that it does things that it cures.
It's the gospel of salvation.
And are these words occurring, occurring in the pre-Christian?
You mean they're talking about gospels and Christ's before Christianity?
Oh my God, you bozos thought you own the world.
Didn't you?
You thought it was all you.
Oh my God.
There he is.
Jesus.
Welcome Jesus, by the way.
Everybody here should know that Jesus was a snake wrangler.
And I don't mean reptiles.
Let's follow the poisons, right?
Everybody who's here knows we're here for the poisons.
We're here to bring back that cold ride.
We're here to show you right here.
It is seeping in.
We're all necromancers.
You've come to the place of necromancy.
Rod.
Here we go.
Go to the next one.
Bring it up.
Boom.
Third.
Yes.
Oh, fantastic.
Right.
Here's your gospel, people.
You're what is this saying?
Greek.
So terion depragmaton ewangelon.
Oh, did you hear me use my diagram?
Yeah.
Ewangelon.
Oh, sounds like a W.
God.
When you say it the right way things happen.
They use it in their tech to make things happen.
They do it with the pharmacy.
Okay.
Let's see how they do it.
Go to the next one.
Oh, what is this thing, by the way?
This is the good news of those salvation things that we possess.
This is the gospel.
You mean the gospel was originally a gospel of drugs?
You know, it's hilarious to watch.
We're getting there with the watchers and we're all watching.
And I tell them, I said, I tried to tell them and they didn't listen.
It was backwards.
People right now, the geniuses in the academic world right now are talking about one, two,
or the drugs possibly involved in this.
Right.
Right.
The very gospel is a gospel of salvation by drugs.
It is a pharmaceutical religious event called a mystery.
Fantastic.
You just learned the mysteries.
All those of you out there who are evangelicals, you just learned what the mystery was.
Don't you love it now?
Clues.
Put together the name.
Put together her name.
She's that one with those seven stars.
Put it together.
Woo.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Nobody does this.
Right.
Let's spoil this.
Throw out all the dope for the kitties.
Look, this is a big long one.
Blow that up.
This is so big.
Writing's tiny.
Yeah.
Oh, this is for people who were bitten.
Right.
He says nobody's ever bitten.
Right.
Is if they have taken the antidote immediately after getting bitten, or if they had the pro
doubt, did the what?
They had the pro doubt.
You know, you can take these drugs all the time.
Marcus Aurelius did.
Mithridates did.
And unfortunately, when it came time for him to die, he couldn't poison himself because
he had so many in him circulating.
Wow.
That's fantastic.
I love that.
I love that.
Cleopatra too.
Cleopatra too.
That's what Galen talks about.
Cleopatra.
You know who she's in the line of?
I hear it's.
What is it?
Porphyrian?
I'm not quite sure, but somebody checked that.
Cleopatra.
Cleopatra.
Oh, God, she couldn't kill herself, says Galen.
Right.
She couldn't kill herself.
That whole story of the serpent biting her.
That's BS.
Right.
But what do we know happened?
Well, we do know that she.
They found her corpse with.
She'd bitten a.
Bitten a chunk out of her arm.
And applied a drug there that could kill her.
Fantastic.
She had two people with her.
There were two servants of her.
Yeah.
They'd rather die.
It was a message Galen says to Augustus.
It was a bird flipping the bird.
Look, both.
Both I and my closest advisors would rather die.
Then give you an ounce.
Of what you're looking for.
You pervert.
Love it.
Love it.
Brilliant.
How did they do this?
Galen tells us.
The magic is happening.
People.
Marcus Raylius is getting high all the time.
Right.
And everybody's noticing.
How are they noticing?
Have you seen how good he looks?
Have you seen how good he looks?
Ten years younger.
Right.
And Galen's like, sh.
Nobody found out while he was alive.
And he was giving it to his entire family.
Says the whole imperial family.
Oh, do you understand?
Will you hear?
Will you have ears to hear?
Right.
Go to the next one.
That reminds me we have more of that text.
Oh, oh, look at this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So look, Galen says, hey, there's a lot of Panurgia stuff going on out there.
What is that?
That's when you're, you're doing it.
He says for the money.
You're doing it for the money.
And he says, what happens?
