You know, this is what you always leave out.
You think you're so smart and you traipse around,
you follow the clues and you've got all the money
and resources in the world, right?
To dip your fingers, all the intelligence right there.
And you never figure it out.
You never do.
Bring that definition up again, please.
What is it that they always miss?
I don't know.
Now he's got me interested.
He's got me interested.
Yeah.
There is a savior who brought you salvation.
There is a savior who brought you salvation.
He bore the wrath of God for you.
Why?
Why did he do that?
That you may have Ionic life.
Wait a minute.
When is Escalus?
Oh God, he's six and fifth centuries.
He's at the height, man.
This is like Mr. Drama.
Oh God.
Go to the next one.
Bring it in.
We're going to bring it down to the root.
Ready?
Here we go.
Here's Prometheus.
What's Prometheus telling you?
You know what it was?
You know what it was, says Prometheus?
I'll tell you what happened.
The mortals were morons.
They had no antidotes to any sort of problem, disease that they had.
I had to show them.
I had to show them what the ones that were the ones that you eat,
the ones that were the ones that you drink,
and the ones that you Christon.
Does everybody see that on the one, two, three, four, fifth line down?
Christon.
You're not going to learn this in church, baby.
You're not going to learn it because everybody there, Protestant and Catholic alike,
follows a fairy tale on unreality,
giving you the communion.
Yes.
You know what happens?
It's magically transformed.
It doesn't feel like it, but it's magically transformed.
There you go.
You're good.
Come back next week.
Yeah.
Do you know what that was based on?
That was based on a real Christ who was arrested in a public park with a naked boy.
At 4 a.m. yelling, I am not a child trafficker.
Get this man his drugs.
Get that man his drugs.
Jesus Christ Jesus Christ.
Bring him up.
There's a creepy Jesus.
There he is.
We know what your thorns are for.
You dirty dirty dirty Christ.
It's lovely.
Look at him.
He looks so.
I don't know.
That one kind of looks good looking.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I can hang out with him.
What?
Did the AI understand that one?
That's not Jesus.
Where is he?
We got one more.
Don't you have Jesus?
Bring him in.
This is when they got the sacred name, man.
This is this is important.
No, that's it.
Oh, yeah.
There.
There.
What he's got.
That's where he's got the whole.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go back to the text.
These people are like, look, I'm.
I got.
I got things to do.
Let's hit it.
Yep.
Next one.
Oh God.
What is it?
People.
What is it?
What is it?
People.
Now I'm going to show you something.
You're going to think it's from the Bible.
That's the trick.
It's not.
It's not.
Seeing.
They don't see.
Hit the next one.
And hearing.
They don't hear.
Do you hear what I just said?
I just showed you the savior and I brought you the very words of the savior.
That is not from the gospel.
It's not from the New Testament at all.
It's not even apocryphal stuff.
Do you know what that is?
That's old Greek.
When they created the mysteries that Jesus was a part of.
Can you feel it?
It's starting to burn a little bit.
Did you put some oil on that?
Thank you, sir.
Let's go.
Where's the next one?
Hit it, Chewie.
We're going to get through this quick because they know it's coming.
They know it's coming.
I was going to purify him.
Look, what's John?
What's that?
You want to tell us at the time when Jesus was walking around?
Remember when Jesus was walking around, the thing that you called the Torah today was
a couple hundred years old, so it had enough time to saturate a reading audience.
What does he say?
What does John say?
Just like Moses, he lifted up that orphan.
He lifted up that serpent in Eremoi, in that wilderness.
So the Son of Man, same thing, needs the same right.
Fantastic.
Did you think you could be a Christian?
If you came here tonight, you thought you could be a Christian without being able to
drink the black death, then you're nobody.
You're a joke.
Isn't that funny?
We look at ourselves in the mirror.
Humanity is a joke.
We follow a fairy tale.
We don't know who we are.
We don't know where we're going.
We don't know what kind of people we are.
And you know who said that?
Bacchus said that in Greek.
In Euripides, play his masterpiece, which is an initiation.
If you didn't know the Bacchai was an active initiation, go get yourself turned on, right?
Now, for those of you who have picked up the name, you'll feel when you do the name you
will understand the name and be able to vocalize it, but you won't.
You won't because it's not in the name.
It's in the function behind the name.
Imagine if you had a wife or a mother or a daughter and that person had a name that
was the reflection of who they are.
Imagine that.
You're a reflection.
I'm a reflection.
No, you're a reflection.
No, you are.
Yes, you are a reflection through a black hole.
