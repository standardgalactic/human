Thank you, MIT.
I'm going to give those guys an award for figuring out the crazy reality that is not the fairy
tale.
It's beautiful, though.
I love it.
Don't you like?
You got a problem with being a reflection?
I bet some millennials have a problem with being a reflection.
Go to the next one.
I'm sorry.
That was grumpy.
That was grumpy.
Here, John, give me a little bit more in order to what?
So those who believe.
So, look, I'm telling you, people, look at the end of this line.
Do you see the Zoane Ionian?
Zoane Ionian.
What is Zoane Ionian?
Oh, don't you like?
It makes me so bothered when I get the, when you can feel it.
When you hit the right place in the Greek, you feel it.
It's like there's power.
I love it.
What is that Ionian?
It's not eternal.
Don't translate that.
It's eternal.
We had a whole satanic initiation on that.
Everybody's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, keep going.
Well, that's what the mystery offers.
It doesn't offer temporal life extension, right?
Into the beyond.
No, it doesn't.
It offers Ionic life.
Don't you wish you knew what that was?
Yeah.
I could have given it to you.
We were by the well.
You know how you are?
We were by the well.
You know, there you were.
All I did was ask you for a bucket.
That's all I did.
Give me some, give me some water.
Yeah.
I'd have given you the water of life.
Have you seen me with my snakes?
Christ, me, Christ, me and Christ, those little boys who are your
disciples.
Jesus Christ, you have boys as disciples.
Jesus Christ is walking around with 12 children and finally gets
arrested with a naked one.
And you wonder, well, this is question number two, question
number one for the first evangelist that reaches out to you,
the first evangelical that tries to convert you.
The first one, you have two questions for him now.
The first one is what's that naked kid doing with Jesus in the
public park at 4 a.m. when he gets arrested?
What's going on?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And yeah.
And the other one has to do with I forget who cares.
Let's go on.
I'll remember in a second.
If I got lost there with Jesus in the garden, it's so compelling.
It's the other thing you're supposed to remind me too.
It's the other thing you're supposed to ask evangelical.
Yeah.
Or someone that offers you communion.
You know what I mean?
Because it all comes down to this right here.
Right here, Mark 16, 18.
Yeah, you're going to take up the hobby of snakes.
You're going to drink the Thanasi Mon.
Do you see that word, the Thanasi Mon?
Look at that.
Look at that.
It's got two accents.
Isn't that nice?
I love it when Greek words have two accents.
It's like they got a little special.
You know what I mean?
Like, I'm going to get, I'm going to get two pitches.
You know what I mean?
I'm going to roll.
Maybe a circumflex.
There's a circumflex in there.
Love it.
What happens?
They're going to drink these Thanasi Mon.
It's not going to hurt them.
Why are they going to be able?
Now, first of all, that word Thanasi Mon, that's the word for
a pharmacological preparation.
A drug compound.
And what does it do?
It induces death.
Oh, nice.
You mean like the black death?
Like the black death.
Jesus says you can drink the potion of Medea and not be harmed.
Now, for some reason, for some reason, it's making me a little
bit queasy.
You mean this, this man, this man from Galilee, because of his
association, his association with those boys and those,
what are those drugs used in Magi that got involved?
What did they give him?
He was a bunch of money and it was a ton of drugs, drugs and money.
Can you imagine?
Christians, can I just, can we reason for a minute together?
Please, brothers and sisters, come together.
I'm not your brother.
Can we just reason together?
The man was given drugs and cash at his birth.
Drugs and cash by people who said they had seen a star.
Yeah, they followed his star.
Do you get it?
Right?
Right?
Is that polythronic?
No.
That star is not polythronic.
That's just the throne, baby.
Right?
You don't understand if you haven't been here, if you haven't
been baptized into that cult knowledge.
Love it.
Let's keep going.
By the way, Marcus Aurelius, they say he was looking so good
that people started questioning what's going on.
And it didn't get out while he was alive.
But now the emperors that follow it, there's a lot more,
they're a lot more loosey-goosey with the, with the
theriac.
You know what I mean?
And they, everybody said Marcus Aurelius is looking great,
brah.
Right?
Oh, okay.
Great.
Fantastic.
Galen didn't have to adjust his opium.
You know, right?
Marcus Aurelius walked around always on opium, chronically
on opium.
Isn't that, imagine that.
Now I know why the head of my department of my dissertation
said the Romans just wouldn't do such a thing because nobody
wants to consider that they would be drug users.
These are the heroes of a lot of nerds.
Yeah.
A lot of history nerds.
Oh God, even those philosophy nerds love Marcus Aurelius.
Marcus Aurelius, did you know your, your hero was chronically
stoned?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now the funny thing is Galen says you can mix these things
together and they will have negative effects that other
ingredients in the formula will modify.
Right?
And he says you can even have a drug that has one effect.
Put it with another drug and it, he says it will do the
opposite of what it did before.
Oh, interesting.
That's some, that's some sophisticated, you know, that's
some sophisticated chemistry and whatnot going on.
