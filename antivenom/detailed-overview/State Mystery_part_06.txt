We bounced too close to that supernova for a minute.
Did you feel it?
Oh God, I love it that you're here with me.
You know what I mean?
People don't realize that you're there and you're on that
throne and you're, boom, traveling.
They don't understand it.
If you get pulled over, don't pull that shit on a cop.
Let's go.
Get your driver's license dummy.
All right.
Give me that.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Look people, we're, look, we can even pull this stuff out of
the, what you call the Torah, but is actually the Septuagint.
Right?
Look at this.
What is it?
What does he say?
He says they have eyes, but they're blind.
Right?
And they have ears, but they're deaf.
Now why is it?
What?
This is Isaiah.
I thought Isaiah was way back in a thousand, right?
A couple of generations after Adam.
Uh, no, um, this is third century.
And of course, contextually, right?
People come to you.
I know, I know they do.
And they try to do things to you.
And I've got dolls.
And you can show me where they touch you on the dollies, but
mentally, I'm talking mental dollies.
Get your mind out of the gutter.
Mental dollies.
And what they do is they try to make you think that this text is
totally different culture, totally different language than it
actually is in.
So when you look at the language that it's actually in, it
mirrors what's going on in the literature around it in the
third century.
And what are they using in the third century?
They're using that expression.
And, you know, um, you need to have ears to hear.
Right?
What does that mean?
Well, you have eyes, but you don't see.
You have ears, but you don't hear.
Right?
It was not Isaiah who descended from yon mountain top.
Right?
We'll get Gerald Nesson to play him again.
Right?
It's the same thing as Moses.
Right?
There he is.
And he's going to give you this.
No, bullshit.
Look at what's in the text.
What does the text actually say?
Well, we see this reflected in the New Testament because it's
immediately preceding it.
People are reading this Jesus Christ before he was arrested with
a naked boy in a public park.
He was quoting a couple of sources and one of them somebody
that were popular at this time and one of them is one people
don't even read.
It was kicked out of the cannon.
Right?
Enoch.
Right?
He's quoting Enoch all the time.
He quotes Enoch more than anybody else.
You know what Enoch is?
That's the, that's the book that talks about the drug dealers.
Right?
Who are teaching all the ladies.
Right?
Why are they teaching the ladies the knowledge of the drugs?
Why?
Because you know, you know, you're a son of God and, you know,
she's a, you know, daughter of men.
You know, that's the way the world works.
Thanks Aphrodite.
Love it.
Right?
Otherwise you and I wouldn't be here.
This would be a void.
Yeah.
Thank you Aphrodite.
Right?
They understood that she's the mother of Rome.
Right?
Are you getting the name?
Is it gone?
First person in.
Winds of free charge up direct connection right to hell.
Love it.
Love it.
Let's go.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Okay.
Let's keep this thing clean.
Yeah.
We know how the drugs work.
You know, we know the ways they work and what sorts they are.
I just want to let you know, these are not amateurs.
Right?
And so you've seen all, I keep bombarding with all these drugs.
Right?
That they're using that are related to the mysteries.
And these are the drugs that people told me.
I could not show you.
I could not show you.
So give me the next one.
So that's my mission.
Right?
Here you go.
Yeah.
Look at this.
Into the first line.
Right?
Oh God.
Oh God.
Look, this is what he's going to do.
He's going to, I'm going to tell you about how these things are
used.
Right?
That's what this whole thing's about.
Right?
Oh God.
But look at the last line.
Eggplacedon, chyton, calyston, pharmacon.
It's scary.
Look what kind of drugs you can scare out.
So you can construct.
You can synthesize.
You can synthesize the ones that are the best.
And these theory acts, they are the best.
These multi-combo drugs.
They are the best.
Give us the next one.
Oh God.
Oh yeah.
What is it?
Okay.
Then here.
And then we're going to jump off here.
Okay.
Look, look, look, look, look.
Galen every once in a while looks up from his scroll and turns away from his talking about
reason and things that we should be able to understand because we've come to conclusions
based on our examination evidence.
Every once in a while, he gets up out of that chair and he kind of reveals a little bit
of his personality.
And here he is.
And some people say, oh, it's pseudo-galen.
It's not galen.
I'll ask you people to play with that.
I don't care.
Yeah.
There's, as somebody who's did his dissertation on galen, see this translation, by the way,
this dissertation, it's a translation and commentary.
I did that for my master's degree under John Scarborough.
And it was a translation and commentary of Galen's Black Bile.
Now, I'll tell you, just from having worked enough galen to appreciate who he was, this
