treatise is awfully galenic.
There's a lot for the 10 reasons that they may find that this, you know, he doesn't use
this combination of words as much.
You know, it's not in this treatise for some reason.
For all of those reasons, there are 10 others for each of those that this is genuine galen.
So Robert Lee, appreciate the translation and commentary is fantastic.
Commentary is fantastic.
It's a Greek commentary.
It's a philologist commentary.
All of my students, it's a must read.
Okay.
Nice job.
But the whole introduction on whether it's pseudo galen again.
Oh, God.
No, I'm not even going to go there.
I'm going to follow John Scarborough and say, no, thanks.
Go to the next one.
Excellent.
Blow this thing up.
Blow this thing up.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So look, what about the applications of these drugs?
Right.
There are some that have the ability for you to ward them off.
Right.
And there are some that will kill you straight up.
Right.
So the theory act, the only reason I wanted to bring that in a little bit out of context,
the theory act is there as that as a balancer.
It is not in and of itself a treatment.
Right.
They used it.
Marcus Ramius at least uses it like it's nourishment.
Right.
Daily making himself look so good and fresh.
Right.
And being with it, by the way, it also treats depression.
Isn't that nice?
You can't walk around depressed all the time.
If you have purged that depression, that diamond, that power, if you will, if you've purged it,
you can't walk around with it.
And that's what these drug combos are doing, not just the theory act on its own, but the
theory act paired with its black death.
And that's the one that we as people will be discovering now in the new libraries.
That's what we'll be discovering is what it was that it was doing to you.
Right.
Hamilton says another 10 years to get an AI that will be able to put together a scientific
model of what all of these interactions are and what the big picture of it is.
10 years.
Oh my goodness.
We're going to have to speed things up.
Do you have 10 years?
I don't have 10 years for this.
Go to the next one.
No, really.
What does the drug do?
Right.
He tells Nero.
He says, you're going to be the source of this stuff.
Right.
This is what gives the adamantine freedom.
You want to become Adam.
Wait a minute.
I thought Adam was a dude in a story with this.
Nope.
You want to become Adam.
Why do you think Paul and Jesus were talking about the second Adam?
Why do you think they were talking like that?
It the story and the text were appropriated so that you would think like that.
When that's not where it goes to, it goes back to what the Adam is.
What is that Adam?
Adam is what the dark harbor gives you.
The dark harbor will burn off your mortality.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Should we get some people?
I keep asking people, how do we do this?
How do we get this?
Right.
If nothing else for depression, right?
A little bit.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Next one.
Freedom, baby.
What is this?
Right.
It's that power that comes from the Medwa.
I keep saying this.
We've talked about the potion of the Medwa in the past.
I keep saying it.
I get a lot of questions about it.
Let me just straighten it out right now.
What is that that I'm saying?
Medwa.
Yeah, that's the name that is the title of a person in history that we all know very
well through the avenue of plays, through the avenue of mythology.
Yeah.
One woman who was a genius when it came to putting together these drugs.
Yes.
She's the pioneer of the Christing.
Let's look at her name really quick.
Everybody asked me, what is that Medwa that you keep saying?
Right?
Medwa.
Who is that?
Next one.
Who is that?
Oh, God.
Here it is.
Here it is.
Medwa.
Here it is in the Greek, right?
Medea hit me with the next one.
What does this Medea mean?
And people were asking, what are the tattoos?
That's one of them.
That's one of them.
But here, I'm going to do some magic.
For those of you who have stopped paying attention for the name, you're going to lose it right
here.
Are you ready?
The ancients called Epsilon, what you and I call Epsilon.
They called it A.
As they called Omicron.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Do you see that little, what's going on?
There's something wiggling in that Yoda.
I see an Epsilon.
What do I know about that Epsilon?
Darn well that thing has a diagramma.
It's got a diagramma in it.
Yeah.
In Greek, there are letters that are invisible.
Deal with it.
Go to the next one.
There's a diagramma there.
Hit the next one.
Look at the succession here.
Look people.
The A and the ache are the ooh and the uke.
So those of you who are sitting there will realize, oh look, they have a common element in that
Yoda and that Epsilon.
Fantastic.
Keep going.
Give me the next one.
Oh, there's one more.
Yeah.
Now watch this people.
I'm going to give you the fear.
I'm going to give you the fear deos, right?
Right when people ask me, what is God from?
What is deos?
Right?
Oh, Niko Yuspeil means this and that.
They're always wrong.
Right?
I want you to get off of your train and come to reality.
What is deos?
Deos.
That's what you feel on the inside of you when you know it's coming.
You know that train is coming.
Right?
Look at who told us on the second line.
That's Amonius.
Hey Amonius.
