Yeah.
What do you say?
Love it.
Look what's written in parentheses in purple.
Right?
Deos.
Look at that second letter.
It's a diagram and it's sitting there hiding.
I say medwa because that is the oldest form of the original Christ.
And from her name, we get medicine.
From her title, we get medicine, the medical arts.
Right?
You wouldn't be getting medicine without medewa.
You wouldn't.
Fantastic.
Go to the next one.
This is just, it's just linguistics.
It's not theory.
Right?
It's just linguistics.
Think about the dea or the dewa.
Yeah.
The dewa.
Good.
Hit me on the next one.
Boom.
And finally, look, games.
Let's play some games with the dea.
Yeah.
What is that?
Well, it's essentially the deus.
What is those Romans?
They must have marbles in their mouth.
Right?
I can't understand them.
Go to the next one.
I'm just kidding.
Any of you Latin people out there, you know that Greek is smart.
Did you pick Latin because you're not?
I'm sorry, but you know it's been years.
I've been waiting for that one since grad school.
Okay.
What is this?
Yobolon.
Dei kaiti supok nam deiri damei.
Oh God.
What's going on?
Somebody's getting damei over there on the end.
Right?
Somebody's getting overcome, getting destroyed.
Right?
Struck by the jaws of what?
Of somebody who hurls eos.
A hurler of eos.
What is a hurler of eos?
It's that lightning baby.
It's that poison.
When we talk about the purple, we're talking the eos.
And that's just how they're using it in the ancient world.
So it's kind of, I wanted you to see that.
Same one?
Yep.
Yep.
And so, look, these theriacs, they can treat you if the poison is coming from the source.
You know, whether it's a bite or whatever, or a dude putting it onto an arrow or, right?
What else if you take the potion of death?
Look at it.
Look at the bottom line.
Poma Thanatu.
And what kind of death is it?
It's guanu.
It's cyanic.
It's black death.
The theriac is used in combo with black death, so that when Jesus Christ, you can take that down.
We're almost done.
Thank you, people, for staying so long.
I appreciate it tonight.
I love you guys.
I do.
I got lots of love.
If you were here, we'd love each other in a group.
That sounded worse.
That sounded worse.
Why do you always have such dirty minds?
Okay, you just love people and not have to cross that line, you know what I mean?
Okay, let's go.
Keep it PG, for goodness sakes.
They're already going to turn me in for something else.
They do every episode.
Okay, let's go.
Yeah, right, right.
What do you do?
Look, what does it come down to?
Hey, Nero, Nero, this is what we need.
Get out, stop.
You know that Nero went out and hunted people at night and beat them up, and he had a Victorian
group of guardsmen who follow him around just in case things got out of hand, right?
That blood thirst is coming directly from that black death, and now you're beginning
to hear.
Now you're beginning to hear.
It's coming directly from that black death, and he says, look, you can take somebody.
You can take somebody who has taken one of these substances that is the poisonous, terrible,
right?
The one that's going to kill you, right?
And I'll tell you what you do.
If you prepare this theriac thing, you're going to bring them a cup of joy, a cup of joy.
You're going to enter them into Hilarion, right?
That's what we call the theriac, right?
It is that place of extreme bliss, right?
You're not going to want to come back.
You're not going to want to come back.
You can take somebody who is in the midst of that Thanasimon, that death drug, and you
can give them this, and you will walk them.
He says you walk them to their bed.
You'll put them into their bed with joy, with joy.
That's the power.
And that's what Galen says in a couple of quotes before that I gave you.
That's what he says is dangerous.
Do you realize the power of the cup of Lady Babylon?
Do you realize it?
Oh my God, you can, you can cure.
You can bring people salvation.
You can Christ.
You can Christ, yeah.
You can Christ.
We can do it, right?
Oh wow, wow.
Ten years, are you sure it's going to take ten years?
Hey, Satanic congregation, I know you guys have brains.
Figure out how it doesn't take ten years.
We've got about one and a half left.
Go!
Give me the next one.
Oh, we're going to finish up here tonight.
I love this stuff.
I love, I love you people.
I'm so full of love tonight.
Can you feel it, Chewie?
Can you feel it?
No?
Come on.
Give me a break.
Yeah, okay.
What's going to happen?
You can lead them, here's to lead them to their coitone.
You can lead, that's where we get our coitus, by the way.
You can lead them to their bed, right?
And they'll be happy.
And they'll have an anodyne on board.
Look at that last word, anodunie.
Isn't that nice?
Anodunie.
Oh, can you hear that little reflection from the Iora subscript, right?
Classes don't know whether or not to leave that thing out or not.
Anodunie.
I love it.
It does something in here.
It makes me kind of like tickly.
Let's go, Caesar, and give everybody the anodyne.
What's an anodyne?
Oh, sorry, you don't know, first of all.
But it's something that takes away your pain.
Something that takes away that stress and that weight of that pain.
You need that, an anodyne, or you're going to go nuts.
It's the way it is.
Fantastic.
You want some theriac?
Let's go.
Not here.
Not right.
