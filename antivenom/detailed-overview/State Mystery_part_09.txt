We can't get all the ingredients.
By the way, I sent the ingredients from Galen to Hamilton.
Maybe he will put something into his calculator and figure something out to do with it.
But a couple of those plants, you know, they're not sure.
I know they found the sylphium.
They found like a relative of sylphium or something.
So that's possible.
The Lemnian Earth will be a little bit hard to figure out, you know, but we also need,
that's the theriac, right?
We also need the black death to make the formula complete for the return of the cup of Lady Babylon.
So we have the formula recipe right there.
You mean this is not about, this is, hello, this is not about fulfilling prophecy?
No.
No, it's about making it.
And the fact that you didn't know that that's what happened shows that you are not a dothos.
You are not one who knows.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Right.
Galen, did you get it?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
Let's go.
Last, I wanted you to see the Roman side too.
I knew I was going to make fun of some Latin people.
People interested in Latin, the ancient language.
Anyway, this is a formula.
Look at the top line.
Just look at that first word, toxicum, right?
Yes.
This is, we get our word toxic from this Greek root and the Romans because their language,
much like Anglo-Saxon crappery, is not advanced.
So they have to borrow ideas and terms, right?
They're not up at that level of sophistication yet.
I'm sorry.
And they need to be honest.
They never really got there.
It's like, why couldn't you?
No wonder they were building huts, right?
Come on.
It's Romulus and Remus you're talking about.
Give me that.
We'll stick out everything from Egeria, right?
Who is she?
Here we go.
Toxicum.
What is it?
It's the poison on the arrows, right?
It's the arrow poison.
What?
We're not using it with arrows here.
We're not out in warfare.
No, what?
Who is this guy that's talking?
He's a first century physician.
This guy is exactly contemporary with Jesus Christ.
Exactly.
Love it.
And what does he say?
He says, look, this is for people who drink it.
You mean he's drinking the same thing as Simon, whoever this prescription is for.
That audience is drinking the same thing that Jesus's peeps are drinking.
If you're a Christian, you would drink it too.
If you don't, you are not.
And apparently there's no more than 144,000 of you.
So put that name on your head.
Fantastic.
I didn't say they were here necessarily now, right?
It's that you bring them by the name.
You bring them into existence, right?
We're not sitting around looking for Jesus in the clouds.
That's the evangelical opposite pole of what the reality of the texts are.
The texts say you fulfill it.
You bring it.
You mean this turned into some hippie manifestation?
No, go home hippies do not need to apply.
Fantastic.
Know yourself.
That's the first thing a hippie doesn't.
All right, let's do it.
Let's do it.
Nice.
Go to the last one.
So here it is.
I just want you to look down.
It's about four lines down on the fourth line.
See where it says in the very middle of the page, furorim.
Yeah.
I love it.
Furorim, right?
What is that?
Fury, right?
Furorim, mentis.
That's your mind.
Mentis.
And you know, they're even stealing that from them too.
Oh, the fear of the mind.
They get with the fear of the mind.
This is what the toxicum does.
And you know what it does?
It causes you to talk in a way that nobody understands you.
It puts you into tongues.
Are you ready?
You know what happens?
They put this on the arrows as they're fighting the Romans.
And when they get hit with this stuff, dudes start acting crazy.
And it takes more dudes to restrain the one dude.
All of a sudden you're taking on whole groups of people.
With this poison.
Oh, God.
Galen's like, look, get it to the military.
Right?
It's got to be, they got to know these theriacs are good.
You can give a theriac to a dude that's just been hit by one of these arrows.
And he'll come out of it.
He won't be babbling, blah, blah, blah, speaking in tongues.
What's that Roman soldier doing?
You realize that in warfare, they're making Christians.
And every Christian out there who thinks that the world is a normal place says, no, brother.
That's only those charismatic.
Let me tell you something.
Christianity from the start was a crazy, mania inducing drug using child trafficking business.
Oh, yeah.
Can you feel it now?
Now the reality sets in and you look around.
And the one dude from Q and I was like, I was right, kind of.
Right?
Because it's funny.
You see the switch?
They are all perverts.
But the one that you think is the number one, he's one of them.
He's probably the biggest one that ever was.
Oh, my God.
History is a sense of irony.
A real taste for irony.
I love that.
Cleo, give me some of that.
Your sugar is so sweet.
Give me the next one.
Last one.
And there we go.
People look at causes this craziness.
Right.
And people are people are talking in tongues.
You can't understand what they're saying.
Remember, take it down.
Remember what we have is a roadmap.
These sources, they are evidence of the actuality.
And now is our time to take that back.
Somebody took control of the narrative and the history diverged.
It diverged from a real history to a fairy tale.
And you and I are living in the radiation of that fairy tale.
But the power of the name of Rome is the adamantine freedom.
When you discover her, you will have the power of Rome.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
