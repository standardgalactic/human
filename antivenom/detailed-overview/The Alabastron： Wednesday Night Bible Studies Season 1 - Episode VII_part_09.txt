asylums, is that a, is that a bigger statement on life, what do we leave with that, this is Mr
Rogers, which it isn't, but if it were, what would that leave us with, you gave me to gentlemen
who were put into geniuses that were put into insane asylums, is that because the physics of
the universe just doesn't, is that just what it bends toward, is that the bending, we all have
to become lunatics and throw our heads back and become bockens so they can put us away, is that
where you're going with all of this? No, where I'm going with all this is the ancients need better,
didn't they, the ancients need better than this, they didn't have lunatic asylums did they,
were the lunatic asylums, I'm on, can you answer that? No, lunatic asylums, no, lunatic asylums,
you're really talking about exiles and yeah, the guys hanging out, the homeless people that
hang out in the cemetery, right, those are your lunatic asylums, right, and the prisons, right,
those are, and there are some in the palace, there are some lunatics in the palace. Yes, yes, or are the emperors
because that's where we're going to go, we're going to go to an emperor with this chap, this chap
wrote a lot, he wrote a lot about succubation, incubation, he wrote a lot, he wrote a lot about
emperors and I don't want to reveal everything on this one occasion, I just wanted to introduce the
guy and I wanted to explain where I've been and what I've been up to and how this subject can affect
just a normal individual, I'm just a normal individual doing normal things, living a regular life
and I've attempted to drop the subject, I've attempted, I've tried to drop the subject and try to
carry on with normal life, you know, do the regular stuff like DIYing and the irregular stuff and it's
it's all consuming, it's all consuming at times and you have to take a break, so I did
and I took a break and in then two days I received this and I can't ignore this, you can't ignore it
can you, something like this comes, you see the name auto and you're just an enemy and I shouldn't be
but I am, I don't know how I got here, I don't know why I'm delivering this but I am, no idea why
yeah and to that, to that I say Hail Satan and beautiful, yeah beautiful, look we're gonna
have him back, we're gonna have our toe back, right now he's one of our ghosts, so get comfortable
with him, get comfortable with him and that's why I want other people on the discord, I want other
people to be to be working toward this goal of gaining these souls and and pulling them out of
that nether where they are and bringing them back because their voices are the powers that are
behind what's going on, right, everybody here believes the fairy tale, we all believe the fairy tale
until you get to the crime scene and then your reality opens up and all of a sudden these ghosts
they're all pertinent, they're all relevant to what we're doing, so yeah we are necromancers,
congregation of Satan, don't forget that. Rob, thank you very much, I'm gonna call it, I'll be
able to come to discord for just 15, 20 minutes tonight but Rob, I think the dead owe you a gratitude,
thank you. Oh I am a gratitude I think, I owe everybody gratitude, I am very grateful
but I'm young man and I have to do my own thing and by doing that I think I'll get there,
I'll help in other ways, that's right, Hail Satan, all the best to everyone, Hail Satan, all the best.
