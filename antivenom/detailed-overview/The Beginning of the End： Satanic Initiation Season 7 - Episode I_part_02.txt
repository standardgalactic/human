Okay, people, this is from the Corpus Hippiatra Corum, Gray Corum. Yellow Cleus, Pheri-e-hidnodecton, ehiodecton.
Yeah, what is something that is ehiodectos? This is a genitive here, Perry. This is just a work. It's a work by a dude
that has to do with things getting bitten or struck by the ehis or the ehidna, the viper. Because, why? Because we have vipers.
And this horse culture is all about these aero poisons. Fantastic. We're on our way. I'm going to bring you some drugs in just a minute.
I know you're waiting for it. Drugs and Jesus. I love it. I want to read this to Dane on Ehidne's Degma. Katahristhen.
Look at that word. Look at that. One, two, three. Fourth word in on that first line. Right? This first line is the title.
And then, second line. There's your poetry. Oh, God. What does it say? Katahristhen. Do you see Christ in this word? It's right under my finger here.
Right? Two down right here. Right? Christ. Somebody's getting Christed. Who's getting Christed? Somebody who has been exposed to the ehis.
To the ehis. Good. Let me keep reading here. And you know what stops it? They've got this thing. Right? That works as a Christ.
Right? It helps it to stop the process of the poison venom. And oh, Chiron. Chiron. Somebody's Chiron. Who's Chiron?
Does anybody remember seeing a dude who you could describe as a horse, part horse and part dude?
Well, these part horse, part dudes live in a place called Thessaly. Famous. Famous for its roots to the Pulaskians, the oldest culture they know.
This is copper age stuff. Right? Oh, God. So dramatic. You've got a horse dude. Yeah. Chiron here. The poem is saying,
What's wrong with you, Chiron? Don't you know there are remedies for the ehis? Rubbing it in. Go.
And don't worry. This is a whole poison history. People dying from it. People using it to have visions. This is the mystery that we are going into.
This is Aleph. Wait, what? Did he say what I think he said? You know where they took that from, don't you?
You know where they took it from. A thousand years before they had ever seen it. They took it from the alpha.
When Jesus said, I am the alpha and the omega. Yeah.
Fact translation. Your history is not what you think it is. Bring up the Greek. Look at the bottom, bottom two lines.
And, you know, he says there was this guy, Cointus, who was, you know, he wasn't a fool and he found four. He found four antidotes and he names them at the bottom.
Gentian. Bay or Laurel. Smurna, which is, you could say it's, sometimes it's just a myrrh, but smurna is also a mixture
used by the Aphrodite group. Oh yeah. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Mary Magdalene and that stuff. The good stuff is expensive.
And look at the bottom here. And what else is there? Aristolokia. Aristolokia. Right? Oh, Aristolokia.
Do you know what you use that stuff for? Abortion. Abortion or delivery. It's an ex, an expeller of the life. How do you know that? It's the witches, right?
I knew somebody today who taught in a different place about hippomanes. What is that? It's the thing that you give to a person who knows and they will prepare for you.
You take it from off of, sometimes it's on the forehead. They say of the full. Some, we're talking about horses now, right?
Sometimes it's just floating around the sack, but you take it out. It looks like a brownish green kind of sticky thing. And you take that and you turn it into a drug.
You can infuse this stuff. Ladies and gentlemen, you can infuse this stuff and drive yourself completely to the edge of erotic pleasure, erotic satisfaction.
