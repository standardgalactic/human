Can you feel me touching that spot? Erotic sanctimony is satisfaction. That's that place right there.
Oh, remember they're all censored, right? They're all censored so that we can stay, right?
So we put a holy symbol. Where's my goat? Get my goat back. Everybody look at my goat. Yes, this is pan.
This is the most accurate representation. Why? Because it's from a, it's a mirror. You're looking, you're looking into it, right?
This is the mirror magic people. Those of you who have ears to hear are picking it up and I want you to use that to ride the initiation through alpha.
Beautiful. Ride the initiation through alpha, right? Join in the chorus. Join in the chorus. This is fantastic.
For those of you who are here for punishment's sake, enjoy.
I love it. Your tortured souls are to me. They are to me the salvation of existence. The salvation of a prison.
Oh, is the morning, the wailing, the weeping. You've got to love it. I've got to love it. It's screed energy is what it is.
I love it. Let's go back to the text. Let's go back to the text. People, I just want you to see a couple of things here.
Yeah, we've done that one. Let's go. I want you to notice that something was getting Christed. Something was getting Christed in there.
Hit me now with the next couple of, watch this people. This is a passage we're going to go to, but I just want you to see the whole thing.
It's sitting there, right? Okay, let's go to the individual. Let's go to the Christ, right?
Where else? Yes, that one. Here it is again. Somebody is Christing something. Christing. What does that mean? Christing.
Here it is again. Next one. Hit it. Yeah, right. There it is again. Different tense. That's all. You Greek nerds will be able to figure out what it is.
Give me the next one. Oh, brilliant. Look, people, I brought you drugs right at the top. I brought you drugs.
What is happening? We're now with Danira. Sophocles. Where'd he go? Sophocles. Have a seat. Have a seat. This is classical stuff, but I want to bring it to you from their eyes.
I want you to be able to see it like they saw it. What's going on here? This is Danira and she's saying, look, I did everything that Sintar told me to do.
I did everything horsemen told me to do. And by the way, when a Greek hears Sintar, just like the Sintars that are in the prophets, that means pedarast.
Sintar equals pedarast. And what did the Sintar tell Danira, wife of Heracles? What did he tell her to do? He said, look, you've got to treat that drug gingerly.
Look what you've got to do. It's got to be apuron. You cannot have this thing exposed to fire. You can't even have it exposed to light.
It's got to, nowhere warm. It's got to sit in its own place. You're going to put it, right?
He wants her to put it into a wooden container and then put it in a dark place because everybody knows that this stuff is combustible.
This stuff will rot you down to nothing. It's like napalm. It'll just keep burning.
Wait a minute. This is one of the drugs they're using and they're called, right? Yes, it is.
Now, get that. Yeah, there we go. Look at the very bottom line people. She says she's followed the instructions, right?
You know, until the time, until the time when she can apply it, right?
When she can make use of it as an artichrist, as an artichrist. Christ. Who is Jesus Christ?
