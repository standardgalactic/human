That can carry the voice.
You know, the mini throne.
This is mini throne.
You've seen the throne of Satan, right?
That seal, by the way, is it called trojisco?
And you put those in your bottom and they dissolve.
Right?
So when it talks about breaking the seal and the beast, know that you're in the right neighborhood.
And this is all that matters.
Everything else is bunk.
And if you can't do the Greek, learn it.
I'll teach it to you.
I have a bunch of students right now teaching them all Greek and the ones that are aggressive.
They'll get there.
They'll get there.
And you'll be facing Adam.
You'll be facing Adam.
Rivers.
And it all comes back.
It all comes back to that medic queen.
And that's why we need her.
That's why she is Lady Babylon.
That's why she is the enemy.
Right?
When people know that Jesus Christ was arrested with a naked boy, it changes their attitude.
I talked to a street preacher.
The sheer logos.
Shear logos.
Talk to a street preacher about that naked boy.
And you could see his universe unravel.
And you could see him left with the reality of what he had.
Now, I didn't give you any theories tonight.
I didn't tell you my ideas.
I didn't tell you what I think.
I gave you ancient sources and told you what they said.
Right?
And that's where our strength will come from.
I want to develop with you, the audience, the Orphic Fox, so that you can enter that death and resurrection, and you can see her visualized.
You can see her.
All we have to do is kiss the devil's anus.
The anus is a word for an assistant who prepares a drug.
We have to kiss her.
She's the one who knows everything.
I think we're going to look for any brilliant last minute questions.
Why didn't he want our eyes open?
Was there an actual reason given?
He didn't want you to be like he was.
That was the reason.
What does that mean?
Nice question, Gina.
Eve didn't get it.
She got the apple and ended up naked.
She got the fruit and ended up naked.
She got it.
Right?
Why wouldn't he want your eyes open?
What a great question.
What kind of God, as long as we're blasphering?
Consider Jehovah.
Consider him.
He kicks out his own wife.
He takes the queen and kicks her out.
Forbids the honor.
Forbids the honor and turns into this sex-hating fiend
who couldn't get it right in the first place
and had to kick everybody out of paradise.
He's got no foresight, dude.
Dude has no foresight.
How can we follow that?
It's a shame.
Here at his death, we have to mourn this entity.
Imagine an entity like that.
A woman-hating entity.
Right from the very beginning.
A woman-hater.
It's not something.
You've got to cover your head.
You've got to cover your head.
No, you don't have to cover your head.
If you want to find freedom, shave it.
Shave it and speak, woman.
Speak.
I love it.
I wish you were all Joan of Arc.
Are there any Joan of Arc?
There's got to be in this audience somewhere.
One of you has the voice.
One of you.
Just one of them has the voice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Zoe's tree.
