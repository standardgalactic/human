And I do think they would be full on
Ready for all out invasion
Into Georgia and Valdova
But then is, we put them up, you know
So they are stopped currently at Ukraine
Which is, I guess for us to be the shield sort of
To Georgia and to Valdova
And protect countries from
With our bodies and lives, you could say
Because they should not move anywhere further
And they should be stopped for good
This time around, I hope
Why are we not helping these people?
Why are we not helping these people?
Why are we giving money to Ukraine
If we could help this and help that
And you just, dudes, we super appreciate the help
Obviously, right, without it would be
But it's not because you give money to Ukraine
That are homeless people in the United States, you know
They just point out various problems
In the United States, and they try to blame it
On the United States helping Ukraine
Against this unjust invasion
Which is pretty strange
Because there's no connection to those things
Whatsoever
Yeah, fantastic, right
Listen to it from the source
I mean, isn't that what we need anyway?
You don't need any commentary
You don't need to explain it
You just need to hear the voice
We're going to hear one more
And then we're going to jump into the cave
What he's talking about is Holodomor
Which is the famine I mentioned
Four million people plus died in that
So not only they were like
Starved to death in Ukraine
But also they would take food
Like Soviet soldiers take it to Moscow
Export it, continue to sell it
While people were just straight up dying of starvation
So five-width loss is something that was on the books
So it's the fact that you can shoot
A person in Ukraine in the head
For stealing food
So basically starving people would still
Still is not the word I would use
But would still the food they themselves grow
To not starve and to feed their families
And they would be shot for that
So this was a very much
A genocide in every sense of the world
And yeah, it's not only that
Like I said, it's mass deportation
Oppression, executions
There was like Red Terror period
Which was right after Revolution
Basically in October
So that was the period when Red Terror
Was happening in Ukraine as well
So people were just killed, dragged down
Out of their houses, shot
For not being willing to be part of
Soviet Union Russia
Yeah, and that's what's coming
They're standing in the breach there
And that's what's coming
So what is
Terribly ironic
And yet beautiful at the same time
Is that the group that holds the signs
That say save the children
Is the group that supports and pushes
The Putin's desires
Whether it's one of our former presidents
Or whether it is
People in our government
This faction is there, right
So what do we need to do
What do we do, but listen to those voices
But bring those voices
Here and say
What is she saying
Where is this dragon
Who
Breeze the fire
Yeah, where is this
Truth
That we're looking for
I guarantee it's on the side of protecting
The mothers and the daughters
I guarantee you
Now he's taking camps
Shame on us
Let me just say something to the Americans
In the group
I know there's others from other countries
But to the Americans
Man, it was our experiment
Right
This was handed down to us
The people who created this freedom
That you feel and breathe
And live in
Those people said you have to
Stand
You have to stand
And if it meant going off
To a foreign country
To help
The cause, then that's what they did
That's what they did
Freedom, we need freedom
Not this tyrannical stuff
Is not new
Is not new
So I hope to have
Anastasia
In interview form and I'll bring those
I'll bring those into you
In short two minute clips
Like this letting her give her
On straight up answers
And there is a
Direct link of course
To our cave
Our cave
Let's bring up the first of the cave tonight
