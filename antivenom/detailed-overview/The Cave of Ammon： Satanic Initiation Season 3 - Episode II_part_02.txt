We're going to go to the Orphic Fragments
Here's that guy I've been blathering
About for so long, Otto Kern
Thank you Otto Kern, there's your name
So here we go
Otto Kern's Orphic Fragments
Number two please
Yes, here we go
I'm going to look at, this is from
Diodorus Siculus
Diodorus Siculus, give us Diodorus's picture please
This is, you know, just a
Made up representation for all we know
You look nothing like this, right?
But here we
Here we have his work, right?
He's writing histories
First century, first century
He's writing great, wonderful
Wonderful stuff, he's trying to go
Back to the roots
Of the people that were
Migrating around, remember we talked about
These migrations, these bronze
Age migrations, tonight
We're going to go one step back
To the
Prehistory
To the
Autochthenist people
People called the Pulaskians
And you're going to be surprised
To find out the things that you got
From certain places you didn't
This is before
Christianity
This is before Judaism
Yeah, this is before
Any of the monotheistic
Theistic religions
Before those things were kicking off
Well, they had some in Egypt too
Right? But before those
Movements within the mysteries
Kicked off
We have these Pulaskians
And we have these rights
Preserved within the language
And I'm going to take you back to some
Of the old language, we're going to go
To the Virgin
We're seeking the Virgin
Yeah, the maiden
Right? Yeah
Please, so in this fragment
What do we have here? Number four
This is from Diodorus
And he says
Gramasi
That's the words I want you to hear
Gramasi
Yeah, they say that
Linus
Composed
The deeds of
Work on the deeds of Dionysus
And that he did it
In the Pulaskian
Letters
In the Pulaskian letters
Yeah, and he left it behind
In his little
Memoirs
Yeah, nice
Also Orpheus
Orpheus and
Pronapides
Pronapide
Don Homeron di Dascalon
Yeah, pronapides the teacher
Of Homer
Oh, nice, nice
So here's Orpheus and here they're
Using the Pulaskian
Letters and you say, wait a minute
Pulaskian, what?
Remember, I've been asking you
To solve the question
Of the dragons
Tom, right?
People are working on it
Nice job guys, yeah
Yeah, Anya, love it
Love it, fish, love it
You're working on those things
And tonight we're going to have some
Little clues
Tonight
We're not working with the orphic
Letters
We're working with the Pulaskian
Letters
Pulaskian Letters come before
Come before everything
For everything
We're talking pre-Egyptian
Culture
We're talking pre-
Indo-European
We're talking about
The basis, the language
The human language is spread out
Through the Mediterranean
And from which we're driving this
Right and this history
Yeah, let's go to the next one please
I want to start
Here, now Linus
They say, composed an account
In the Pulaskiic Letters
Of the deeds of the first Dionysus
And of the other mythical legends
And left them among his memoirs
And in the same manner
Use was made of these
Pulaskiic Letters by Orpheus
And Pronapides, who was a teacher of Homer
Great, and a gifted writer of songs
Right
Notice, I just want you to see
He mentions Lea Meaden
