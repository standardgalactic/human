He talks about going to Nissa
Where the ancient natives of the city relate
The Dionysus was reared there
Yeah, and that there's this thing
Called a
Frigian poem
Yeah, okay
Next text please
This
Is the expression
Yeah, in the Pulaskian Letters
Good, I want you to look at that
Pulaskian, who are these people
Go down
This then is the account
Of Dionysus, among the Greeks
Linus was the first to discover the different
Rhythms and song
And when Cadmus brought from Phoenician
The letters, as they're called
Linus was again the first
To transfer them into the Greek language
To give a name to each character
And to fix its shape
Now the letters as a group are called
Phoenician
They were brought to the Greeks from the Phoenicians
But
As single letters
The
Pulaskians were the first to make use
Of the transferred characters
So they were called Pulaski
Okay
You see what I'm saying
So this is an old
Old, old, old
Not this guy, get him off there, we'll bring him back in a second
This isn't, that's a Lemnian
Steel, anyway
This
Pulaskian language that predates
There's
Questions, who are these Pulaskians
And what are they doing now
These Autochthenist people spread throughout
From Asia Minor into Greece
Right, here's the sites, nice map
There, look at, they're on the island
Of Lemnos up there
Yep, off the coast of Thrace
Right, Samothrace
See Samothrace there, take it down
If you were sitting there on a beach
In Thrace
You can look
And you can see Samothrace there, nice island
Beyond that
Beyond that, where it's no longer visible
Is that Lemnian
And we have a Lemnian Steely
And it has on it
The characters that
They were debating about, this is Lemnian
We're going to call it Lemnian
But long story short, it turns out
It's Pulaskian
And logically it looks
Not like Etruscan
Yeah, it looks like the Pulaskians
In the Etruscans are the same people
Those of you who are
Learning dragon tongue
The Orphic
Letters
Can use this
To help you decipher them
Okay, and let me
Just pull that up again, by the way
This is in Bustrophodon
So, for those of you who are saying
Wow
Is it go right, left, left, right?
Yes, the answer is yes, it goes both
It's like a snake
More than a
More than a cow walking around
But okay, whatever
They didn't call it Ophistrophodon
Yeah
It's a woofer snake
Okay, next
Next slide, please
How did the Phoenician
Letters appear on the Greek mainland?
The Palace of Cadmus
Is an historical figure
It's been discovered in Thebes
And maybe roughly dated
Around 14 to 1200 B.C.
And letters were found in it
But they were not of Semitic origin
Take it down, that's in the
American Journal of Philology
Now we're going to philologists
I'm going to quote a few philologists here tonight
Because this is the stuff that turns them on
This is all you do with it
You're trying to figure out where these languages come from
That's why anybody who forbids you
That's a bad, bad dude
Bad dude
Yeah, needs to be stopped
Yeah
So we're talking
Early on 1600
Right, next slide, please
Thank you, Chewie
Now Linus they say
Compose an account in plastic letters
The deed to Dionysus and the other mythical legends
And left them among his memoirs
In the same manner
Please go on
Yes, here we go
Further
Further in there is a cave
Let's just go to the cave
We're walking around, sorry that was a little herky-jerky
But we're walking around with
The Pulaskians
