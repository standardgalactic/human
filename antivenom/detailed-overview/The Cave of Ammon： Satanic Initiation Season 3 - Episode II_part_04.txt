And their religion
And we're going to their religious sites
And we're going to look at their gods
All the
Oomph, oomph, oomph
Is a Pulaskian sound
Isn't that nice?
You see it in things like chords
So there are Pulaskian roots
All over the place in the Greek world
In the Greek world
And they talk about
The Pulaskians are all over the sources
You can go look them up
And
You'll find them in historians
You'll find them in playwrights
From Sophocles
Yeah, isn't that cool?
Anyway, it looks like
They were considered
To be the ancestors
Right?
But considered to be the
Greeks
Sometimes they're described as Greek
Yeah, and
They're ending up in a lot of
Old, old, old Greek religion
Coming out
We're going to look at one that shocks you tonight
From
The Septuagint
Believe it or not, it's buried in the Septuagint
Isn't that cool?
Alright, bring up that next one
Here we go. Further in there
Is a cave circular in shape
Of a marvelous size and beauty
Just get the cult context going in your head
For above and all about it
Rises a crag of immense height
Formed of rocks of different colors
For the rocks lying bands
And sin forth a bright gleam
Some like that purple, which comes from the sea
For the entrance-grown marvellous trees
Some fruit-bearing, others evergreen
And all of them fashioned by nature
For no other end
And to delight the eye
Take it off
And to open it
Yeah, to open it
Coming from the side was the expression
Yes, yes
Okay, next
Same slide, good
Now to this cave, the account runs
Amen came and brought the child
That is Dionysus
You mean Dionysus
Is a child of Amon?
Yes, he is
And gave him into the care of Nissa
One of the daughters of Aristaeus
And he appointed Aristaeus to be the guardian
Of the child
He being a man who excelled in understanding
And self-control and all learning
The duty of protecting the boy
Against the ploddings of his stepmother Rea
He signed to Athena
Who a short while before had been born
And had been found beside the river
Triton
Good, good
That's why we call it Tritonian
Nice
We need to find a location and a place for this
We need to zoom in with the language
We need just to let the language
Carry us to that place
We're keeping our hand on the rope
In the cave as we go through it
As we go through it, good
Next text
Yeah, I'm not going to read all this
I just want you to see
When the valor and fame of Dionysus
Became spread abroad, Rea
Angered at Amon, strongly desired
To get her Dionysus into her power
Okay, I want you to realize
There is a struggle going on
And that you see the word Crete
Right, as for Cronus
The myth relates, after his victory
He ruled harshly over these regions
Which had formerly been
Amon's
Okay, take it off
Yes, the father
Of the first
Dionysus
The father of the first Dionysus
Is usurped
By
The Saturn
Yeah, okay
Alright, so that should put you in some context
Take out your everybody
Pull out your augers now
Right
Right, you know where we are
Sun, moon and stars, okay
Hit it with the next, please
We're running from time tonight
Go ahead, yes
Since the Libyans had said to Dionysus before the battle
That as the time when Amon had been driven
From the kingdom, he had prophesied
That's what I want you to see
Amon is
The prophetic
God
There is a reason that that cult
Is spread throughout the Mediterranean
And always has that
Irracular
Current to it
