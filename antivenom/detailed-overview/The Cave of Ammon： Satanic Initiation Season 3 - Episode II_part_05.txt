Always has that irracular
Current to it
The Dodonian
Prophecy
That is so important to the Greeks
Right
Everybody goes to Dodona
Right, that's just the way it is
It's one of big, big oracles
And
That's Pulaskian
Yes
So you see the operation
People say did this come from Egypt
Did this come from what about this
What about Phoenicians
There were no Phoenicians around
They only called themselves Phoenicians
Because of what the Pulaskians
Were doing and the name Pulaskian
As a classical
Philologist
Looks like it comes
From the word for purple
The purple die
Yes
Yes, the purple die
Do we have that
Yeah, Pelagium
Right, relating to the sea
Right, Pelagios in the Greek
We're following the Romans here
Right, sea mussels
Go back to that please
Sea mussels, look at that, sea mussels
Follow the way down the pages to
Roman numer number two
And look at the Pelagium
The purple color
Our Pulaskians
Are originally
Of
The purple
The Phoenicians who take their
Gramata
Who transmit that Gramata
To the Greeks
Are calling themselves
The purple people
Yeah
The purple people
We're talking prehistory
Prehistory
Is where this is coming from
So don't try to tell me
How it is
That some antinomian
Got involved
As he done exist for
Thousands of years
Yeah
Your Christianity and your Judaism
That they've just been
Non-existent
They don't exist, but the
Oracular
Saturnian religion
They're promoting
This
Chance to have
Ionic life
This thing
Is very real and
Very much out of
This old
Prehistoric
People, please, next slide
Wonderful
Egyptians, I see your Egyptian
And I raise you Pulaskian
Pulasgos
Yeah
Look at the under A
Just look at the first word in Greek
Dodonin
Pulasgon
Hadranon
The seat of
Pulaskian Dodonin
Look on the second line down
I told you, Dodonin was big, right?
Look at Turseno
And right away
You say, wait a minute, the Pulaskians
Were the Tursenois
Yes
Yes, wait
I know the Tursenians
Also called
By the Greeks, the Tyrenians
That they were those
People
That the Romans
With their Venus's tongue
Called the Etruscans
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, fantastic
So if you look at Etruscan
You're going to find out
It looks just like the old
Pulaskian
Which scholars
And classical philologies
Have sat around for decades
A century, two centuries
Debating
What the origins of these words
Are
It looks like it's related to Thracian
And trying to trace it
Where it comes from originally
And it always
Goes back through the river of the Mycenaean
Greek
Right, it's one of the places
That it just made its currents
Now, give us another
Mmm, yeah
And Cersei, so coming to
The Etruscans brings us to Italy
