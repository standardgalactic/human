And it goes back through
The bronzes, through
It's captured in the Mycenaean
Linear B
Which is where these people are
It's why Amun is in Crete
Yeah
It's why Amun is in Crete
Gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
Nothing is the way that you thought
Welcome to Amun's cave
Nothing is the way you thought
I'm offering you
Some of the most beautiful
Distilled reality
That you can possibly make
And it drips
From the ceiling of this cave
Of the
Pulaskians
The place where that virgin
Becomes
The oracle
That's why we're stealing everybody
Yeah, pirates, man
Pirates get dragged into this
Right?
Oh my god, it's gorgeous
Absolutely gorgeous
So, as we're trying to look at
Dragantown, we're trying to see
How to decipher it
We need to get serious about its roots
And we need to see the connection
Between the Orphic letters
The Pulaskian letters
And the performance
Of the mystery
Dionysus is the son of Bacchus
Is the son of Amun
Right?
Bacchus is the son of Amun
Yeah
Yeah
That oracle
Was a Bacchic
Establishment
Kurene
Is not
A native Greek word
Yeah
It turns out it's Pulaskian
So where do we go with the origins
Of
Christianity, which started with
A man getting arrested in a public
Park with a naked boy at 4am
With stuff on his face
Screaming about being thirsty
And no, I'm not a child
Trafficker
How do we get to that
Point?
Through this pathway
Through this pathway
And how are we going to find
This place again
This is our history
Nobody here that doesn't share this
History
This is human history
Yeah
We need to find it
We've got people coming on
Do we have people in the gallery
Tonight?
Yes, we do
We've got Rob
I want to say a few words before we start
In
Where is
The Gnostic Informant
We're waiting for Gnostic Informant
Because he's going to announce something tonight
He's going to announce something
So we'll maybe give him a minute to pop in
Come on, Neil
If you're not going to make your announcement
I'm going to make your announcement for you
But that's, no
I don't want to do that
Let's start off with just a response
To the material that we're talking about
With the Pulaskians
What do you think about
Pulaskians and Dionysus
My favorite part was
Egypt
I read you a Pulaskian
I really like that
I'm going to have to learn how to say Pulaskian correctly
And I'm going to use that one
That was an excellent presentation
Again
I'm going to have to catch up on
You're on fire
You know you're on fire at the minute
And you're hitting as hard with information
Because you know now
There's some way for it to go
A beautiful info on the Orphic
For classmates
I'm sure they'll appreciate that
I kind of like
The Aristaeus part
Because if I'm right
If I remember rightly is the son of Apollo
And
The father of Actaeon
If I remember rightly and that means
Just little bits to me
Just to go all the way back
To each root
In the language
And foresee that in the linear B
Is phenomenal and mind-blowing
And rather conclusive
In my opinion
Fantastic
Fantastic
