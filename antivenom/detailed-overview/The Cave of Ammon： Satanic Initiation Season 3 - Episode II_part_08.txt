Snappy, your response
I was really blown away by your lecture
So the Pulasgians are something I've been interested
In a while
So a philosopher I love
Is this guy here, Lydwood Clogges
He wrote a book that I'm reading
Called Cosmogonic Arrows
And he uses the Pulasgians
As an example of sort of
Primordial culture
And like returning to
An original base
For the Bronze Age
And then he connects that with the Bronze Age
Mystery rights in India and in other places
And I just wanted like
There's just so much cool stuff he talks about here
About how the center
Part of the
Pulasgian society was
Almost taking care of the dead
And the rights for the dead
They'd be buried under the stoves and the houses
Right in the center of the home
And everything was centered around
These cycles of death and rebirth
And they would wrap them in purple cloth
It's really powerful stuff
So we're getting somewhere really interesting
Fantastic
Fantastic and
Thonius
Give me your take on tonight
I thought it was amazing
That the Pulasgians
Being the root of the purple
And finding their origin of the language
That the linear being
From what I take it
I think it's amazing
And I think that they might hold the key
To all the ingredients
And how you said that
Father of Dionysus blew my mind
And you said that Kronos
Usurped
Dionysus' first father
And it makes me wonder if
Amen was Orinus
The only Amen that I've read about
Is in the Hermetica
You blew my mind tonight
Fantastic
You have to love
You have to love the fact
That years later
People come along
And take little bits of that
And preserve it
And pass it on
Yeah
And
Let me just ask Thonius
You brought in
Oh
Some psychoanalyst
I think his name was Jung
Jung
You've been looking at some Jung
Does any of this stuff
With Jung at all? What you've been seeing?
Well, from what I've been reading
About Jung is that
He
From what I understand in the red book
It's like he is trying to mimic
What Zeus did
He's trying to go into the abyss
And talk to Nix and to know all things
And it's
It's kind of
It's kind of onto that
No, that's exactly
That's exactly what I meant
He's putting it into
Don't you think he's practicing the mystery?
I mean, he's even getting responses
About the future
And from other people who are telling him
Who are bringing him elements of the future
That are
Shocking him
It's the operation of the mystery
Love it, Snappy
Love it, Thonius
He even said that he got the scepter
He went down there and he pulled out the scepter
From going into the abyss
And talking to the oracle, basically, of night
It's just like Zeus did in the Deverny Papyrus
He tried to...
Yeah, and now the question is
Was he doing that because he was drawing
On that
Reality?
Or was he doing it because he was reading it
And recreating it
Well, we know with the
With the boy that he was talking to
At the
Who was inside
The
Place where they kept
People they didn't want
Running around
For whatever reason
He was talking about
Future, right?
He had never seen the...
He didn't know about the release of this material
He didn't know about
What it meant within ancient religion
Yet it found him
Within a person
Right?
Gorgeous
Snappy
Do we have any
Do you have any impression of the more
Easterly
