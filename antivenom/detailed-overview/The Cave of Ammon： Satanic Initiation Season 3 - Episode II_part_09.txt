Working of the Pulaskians
Through Colchis
And through...
Are we getting over? Do you want...
Do you smell India in any of this?
I think you're muted
Oh, definitely
When we're looking at Mycenaean culture
You can compare a lot of this
To what's happening in Harappa
In the Indus Valley
And there's a lot of key things
We're seeing the presence of the bulls
We're seeing
The bull wrestling motif
We're seeing these same horns
In these horned figures
And then we're also seeing
Predominantly is that mother goddess figure
Snakes
And then we know that they're both cultures
Are using cannabis
And they're engaged in this purple trade
Because we have traces of the purple in Harappa
But they're not producing it
So they're getting it from somewhere
Right?
And then there's also these seals
That look a lot similar
So there may be even a connection
Between the Harappan language
And what's going on with the Mycenaean
Gorgeous
And you know, there's so much
Of a frontier there
For people to figure out
To figure out where the influences
Are coming from
How the languages are being pressed
On the civilizations
And you mentioned the snake goddess
Right?
Why is the snake goddess so prevalent?
It seems like a strange thing
But there you go
You have it, right?
And it's gorgeous
The cold
The use of these venoms
Yeah, oh, it's amazing
We'll end up with Rob
Rob, you have the last word
You have the last word
I think somebody's mic is on
If you guys can mute
Rob, you have the last word
You have the last word
I want you to say something, please
About Anastasia
About Anastasia
I was educated as far as I could tell
I was very impressed with
Her abilities
To
Watch the messages as the K-men
As well as engaging
A deep engaging conversation
And to do that take some
She could answer every question
With eloquence and have got
A great deal about it
I just won't go to
The snake goddess though
Because I discovered something
Profound, that you know the snake goddess
Since she's holding the two snakes
That's the image we all see
What I found is
That's the votive
That's the votive to the snake goddess
The snake goddess doesn't
She's the snake goddess
Of course
But she isn't holding two snakes
And I found that very curious
And then I'm going to go to father
So you're the father of Dionysus
And if Anastasia was here
He'd be all over you
Because he thinks
Your name
And you're responsible for
Quite a lot, aren't you?
Through history, so
I'll leave you with them three comments
Alright
You guys heard it here
Thank you for coming
And next week
We're going to bust into
We're going to have our fight club week
Right, so every season
We have one fight club
So there's seven seasons
People have been asking
Is there a beginning and an end to this?
Yes, there is
Believe it or not
It's a narrative, right? It's a song
So
There is
And tonight, next week
Next Friday
We want to have the fight club
So I'm encouraging everybody
Who wants to step up
To say
I am a child of Heracles
And I am unafraid
Of your
Tennessee law
Yes, okay
Thank you guys for coming tonight
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
Just put on
Different masks
And ask the questions that that fella might have
