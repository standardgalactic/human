But we're going for that deep dive right into the heart of that ancient mystery
And we're going to have to start with killing, with killing other people
We have to go to a sacrifice in order for this mystery to proceed
Turns out we've got it for you
Let's take a look at the sacrifice clip, can we do that?
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Wave continues, the wave continues
We are provided with a holy sacrifice
Thanks to the evangelicals
Thanks to those charismatic
Who reached out to create and mold a society that was not their own
But reached out and in that society planted a hatred
A seed of hatred is so great that it is finally this week
Shown itself for the monster that it is
Welcome to the apocalypse
Yeah, welcome
More death, more sacrifice, it's what gives us the power to continue the mania
You guys asked to up the mania in the pool
And I told you, I take those serious
It's getting hot, it's getting hot
And you're going to have to, you're going to have to be able to discern
What's coming, scientifically
You know these charges are being handed down at a very specific time
So we have to pursue them with the utmost diligence
We have to call in the right witnesses and tonight we've got Paul
So I welcome my guest Akidna
I welcome her and I have to give her the place here
Because tonight we're going to really be dining with her
We're going to be dining with her
And Paul, yes, yes I know, I know it's Latin
Just ignore them, Paul, take a seat, take a seat Paul
I want you to tell me what you know Paul
I want you to tell me what you know about the right
I want you to tell me what you've been on
And where you've been Paul
We know what's going on Paul
I just want you to get it off your chest
There has to be some good cop
After all, trying to set a good impression tonight
Can we go to some Greek?
I want to bring us our first Greek tonight
This comes right out of a tragedy
And that tragedy is centered around
Take it down, that tragedy is centered around her
She is such a fury
She's the one who makes it so that decay can exist in the cosmos
Decay is justice
Imagine that guardian of justice
Guardian of justice, that's who we're with
Wow, this is primal stuff
This is stuff that the Olympians look back on
Knowing their foundations lie back there
Yeah, this is fantastic
Let's bring her up
Speaking in a place that would establish the courts
Where decay herself would be queen
It says once a man's blood has run into the sand
There is no resurrection
What is that resurrection?
Where are we? Oh my god, we're hundreds of years too early
We went too far back
We landed right in the lap of the stage
Where the Bacchic revelry is coming down to find a landing pad
Those devil's wings that you're on
They bring you to this place
To this tragedy
And here we have the great and terrible echidna
In all her fury
Bringing us the establishment of justice through the cup
Oh, this is gorgeous
This is elusis
Oh, this is that place
Can we go on? What does it say about her?
I just want to, before we sit down
I want her to know exactly who she is
And what she's here for
That last term, anastasis
Some of you will jump
And maybe get a little feeling somewhere in your body
A little tickle
And you will say, oh my goodness
He's talking about the resurrection
He is
He is
He's talking about the mystery
Fantastic, Paul
Get over here, where's that tiny little something
Right, did you hear that?
Right there, come here
