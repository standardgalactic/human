Angelo satana
Wait, what did he just say?
I heard him say Satan, right?
Did everybody hear him say Satan?
Yeah, he was given a what?
A Skolops
What's a Skolops?
Did somebody pick it up?
There was an evidence bag with that thing
Bring us the Greek here for Skolops
No, no, we're not there
I think it's probably near the very end
Skolops
Just keep going people
Don't worry, this is all evidence, right?
Some of them may put things together better and quicker
You know what I mean? Let's do this one
Bump
No, that's up, go up
There we go, one more
Oh my goodness, this is terrible
What a terrible...
Look for my Skolops
That thing is somewhere around here
The flesh eating
We don't need the flesh eating right now
We don't need the crazy looks
We don't need the rolling in the eyes
It's really cool to actually watch that happen
We need the Skolops
There we go
My God
Nice save, Chewie
Look at this, anything
Pointed
Especially a pale
A pole
Is it a pole pale?
It's kind of steak
Steak, anything pointed
The Skolops is what pierces you
It's what pierces you
That's why you see that number two
Thorn
Thorn
Not just any kind of thorn
Not just any kind of thorn in your flesh
But what kind of thorns are they using here?
Look at Armoredale
Skolop has foiny costs
Foiny costs let those of you with ears to hear
Take it down
Let those of you with ears to hear
Hear it and see it
Right?
Wonderful
This thorn in your flesh, Paul
That we still have in evidence
What does it make you do?
It's what?
It's what?
It's a messenger
It's a messenger
It's a mess of solace
Give you gotta do it right
Do it at all
What do you say louder?
Messenger
Messenger
Messenger
Gives him a messenger
What kind of messenger, Paul?
Satan
Satan
Look, bring it up one more time

Nope, not that one
The other one where he says Satan

In his sarks
