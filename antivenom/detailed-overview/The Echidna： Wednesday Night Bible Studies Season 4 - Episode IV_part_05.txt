I know that you're hungry
And that you eat flesh
I know that you do
I know that there is a thorn
With purple
The burns
The burns and it comes out
Right out of a Kidna
Comes right out of your ancestry
Comes right out of the Scythians
The Arimoi
Comes right out of them, doesn't it?
Those bald, shaved, headed, dead dude people
Walking around with their cannabis
Taking vapor baths
We're gonna even bathe
You know what we do?
We sit in the smoke of the cannabis
Isn't that nice?
That's amazing
That's an amazing group
It's from these family members of yours, Kidna
That we bring out those most potent poisons
That we're involved with in the right
The ones that give you the kick
The ones that are there
That Jesus is walking around saying
If you follow me
Right?
Come
Look, it's a little boy with me
Right?
If you come with me
You can take this snake venom
Won't bother you at all
Yeah
Won't bother you at all
Why do we need the Kidna?
Because she is the one who assaults Uranus
With the blood of her beloved Typhon
And what does Typhon do?
Typhon cuts the Neura from Zeus
Typhon cuts the Neura from the one
Who sits on the Thron
In Uranus
Thronus
Po Thronon, Pharmacon
Yeah
Fantastic
Let's get another text
Let's bring Kidna to full view
So that we can complete ourselves
What does she do?
This Kidna is Lugre
And she is Kubokhthon
Right?
And she sits there
With the Arrimans
The Arimoi
And what does she do?
They're also called by the way
That's a tribe of Scythians, right?
It's a tribe of Scythians
I should have said that
And these people are what?
What are these people?
Sometimes
They're called those who live on the extreme
Right?
They're the ones who are there at the edge
Right?
Right at the edge of reality
They're also called Khmerians
Right?
These Arrimoi are the ones who are bringing you
The purple
And what does it say about a Kidna?
What is she doing?
She is brought
She is brought up, right?
From the Chthonian place where she dwells
Where she lives
Where she inhabits
She is a what?
Who are you, Kidna?
You're a Numfe
You're a Bride
An Athanatos Numfe
An immortal Bride
What kind of an immortal Bride?
And when I say Bride
