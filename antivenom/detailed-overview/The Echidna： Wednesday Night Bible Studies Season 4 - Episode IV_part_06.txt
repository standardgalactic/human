Pull it down for one second
Everybody know
We've got to get the right images here
If we don't tune in
There's no reason for a Kidna to be here
Right?
We've got to get the exact right images
And the exact right image is for her, the Numfe
You're talking Juliet
You're talking somebody who is just entering a marriageable age
And she is Athanatos
She is immortal
She is immortal
And what else does she do?
She never ages
She never ages
You can take these Medusa
Medea has 12 of them
12 of these Scythian Medusa
Now imagine this
This is the most romantic
Right?
This is why I got dressed up
Is because I wanted to paint that picture
For you of the
Medusa who is a foot
A head, excuse me
A head taller than the tallest man
Muscular physique
Appearing to be about 12 years old
You know
Excuse me
What else?
Kind of rough skin
A little bit of skin condition
Sensitive to the light
A little aggressive
A little aggressive
Very physical
Very physical
Unafraid
She puts her drugs in her hair
She puts her drugs in her hair
And if that stuff touches you
It'll turn you to stone
Yeah
Love it
Love it
Let's bring up another text for her
What else can you tell us about Kidna?
Right?
So her mother gave birth to her
When she did
It was Peloron Amechanon
It was a prodigy
It was a miracle Amechanon
An irresistible
Impenetrable
Unavoidable miracle
She wasn't like mortals
She wasn't like gods
She lived in a cave
Her power was drawn
She is the god
Thein
Ehidnan
Half of her is that numfe
Helikopida
Nymph who is
Helikopida anime eyes
Helikopida anime eyes
Yeah
And what else is she chewing?
I just want to get
I know you're trying to get those animal eyes
The gang is quick tonight
I don't know why
Okay, here we go
Here she is
And she is half that
Fantastic
Half of that
Prodigy
Snake
Terrible thing
Great
And Iolan
That means the sparkling
Have you ever seen a snake?
If you look at
Ehidna from the waist down
