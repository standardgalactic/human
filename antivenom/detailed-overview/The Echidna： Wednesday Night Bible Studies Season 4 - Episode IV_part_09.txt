Christians, right? They need it
Anybody who follows the irracular divinity
Jehovah, they need this
They need this event
Yeah, why? They don't realize it
It's based on things that were around when they weren't
But that's how we are, isn't it?
That's what I tell the watchers
I'm like, dude, okay, I know
They're gonna be surprised again, right?
They're gonna be surprised again
But there's nothing we can do about it
There's nothing we can do about it
Because we're not here for them anyway
We're here for Eve, right?
We're here for Eve
I want to leave you with the impression
There is an ideal out there
That we can reach toward
That you can take the human experience
And you can tune it
You can tune it to create a sphinx
You can tune it to create she
Who can tell you past and future all at present
You can tune that world
It's in the genes
It's in the nature
It's inherent
All we have to do is follow
Follow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a Nobel for the next person
Who realizes the applications
And realizes just what exactly they were doing in antiquity
When they were making these, you know, tiny computers
They figured out movements of the stars
Stuff like that, right?
Yeah
Where have you been lately?
Say the watchers
Trust me, guys
I'm always gonna be
I'm always gonna be running interference
But we're right there
We have to bring this investigation
It's gotta come
Beautiful
Did you want to post something?
That's okay, fantastic
Right, I want everybody to know that
We appreciate the fact that
The matrix of justice
Is still venerable
Is still venerable
We can still look to Lady Justice
And say that
That's who I want to be with
Yeah, yeah
And still bring her back
It's the constant hope
It's a constant hope
And if she doesn't come back
Christians don't get what they want anyway, right?
So, because she has to offer the cup
And et cetera, et cetera
Next time we're gonna look at Jesus
Right down there with him on his level
We're gonna confront him about the drugs
And the confusion when he's stumbling around the garden
We're gonna try to go to the toxicology
We're gonna get a report from the guys who arrested him
What was his blood alcohol, right?
No problem, that's the kind of evidence
We're gonna be presenting
Thank you everybody for coming
And thank you most importantly to Echidna
For always being there
In the back of our human consciousness
Thank you for always being there
Yeah, it's almost like you're just right over my shoulder
You know what I mean? Love it
Hail Satan
Drink and whiskey
