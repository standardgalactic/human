Right?
But that tribe of Levites,
that tribe of Levites,
guess where they come from?
Oh my God, are they in on it too?
Are they in on it?
Holy mackerel.
Let's look at it.
When this thing was written,
when your Torah,
when your Bible was written,
the Old Testament was written
in the third century BC,
the knuckleheads that composed it
borrowed from the cult
that was present in their society.
It's not a surprise.
It's not a surprise,
but they weren't smart enough
to hide it.
They just left it in the open.
It just says it.
Okay, let's keep going.
I'm getting my blood is up.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Every time biblical scholars,
I smell a biblical scar.
It makes me so mad.
If I had a room full of biblical scars,
I would be like,
okay, now I'm going to hold you
accountable for all your BS, right?
And I'd be like, stand up.
Come here.
This is my fantasy.
I can have fantasies too.
What I would do.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hurt anyone.
Nor would I cause any sort of
permanent damage to their
fragile psyches.
No, of course not.
This is all in love.
When you purify someone,
come here like this,
biblical scholars, come here.
Come here.
Here, take down your little pants
and bend over.
No, bend over.
There you go.
Thanks.
Did you know there's no term?
That whole Urim and Thurman thing,
those actual Hebrew words,
you know, they're not in the Septuagint.
They totally altered the text afterwards.
You know what those guys were doing
with the Dead Sea Scrolls?
They were making Hebrew versions
from the Greek.
Oh my God.
And everybody's like,
oh, this is so wonderful.
We have something.
No, you don't.
You have Greek,
you have copies of a Greek text.
That's all.
Appropriation is appropriation.
This stuff belongs to the Greeks.
Who do you think was making profits?
Go.
Let's go.
It's Bronze Age.
Greeks aside.
Pulaski.
And if we want to give credit,
we've got to say Pulaski.
Because it's old.
This technology is old.
Let's go to the next one.
For all the pests that out of earth arise,
the earth's own self,
the antidote supplies.
She breeds the viper,
but she too, the sage.
The means presents to quell,
sorry.
The means presents to quell the viper's rage.
All kinds of gems spring from her bosom wide.
Yeah.
And hapless mortals
with sure help provide.
Let's go to another one.
Do you see how much
where is the thinking here?
The scientists are thinking
we get dotes and antidotes.
We give drugs.
They cause a reaction.
We give antidotes to block the activities
or the symptoms that those drugs produce.
We make a cocktail so that we can specially design the person.
Imagine if it's the future
and you can walk up to a panel
and you can push button
and you can say,
I need a combo that lift me up,
pull me down,
put me this way,
make me feel this.
Give me a couple inches of height
and maybe make me aroused.
Boom.
Out it comes.
That's only because of people
who have done thousands of years of work
on what those substances do.
That's a lot of laboratory time, people.
That's a lot of laboratory time.
And who is the one culture that we keep seeing?
Who that are really pioneering this?
Dote and antidote.
What's the one culture?
It's those children of the sun.
Daughters of the sun.
They're the ones who are doing all of this experimental stuff.
All of this experimental stuff.
Did you see in this cult text
that I've been reading you
from the translation?
That's what the English is that I keep putting up.
It's all cult text.
Did you notice the names that we've mentioned so far?
Cersei and Medea.
Of course.
Of course.
Let's go back to the next source.
This is going to get really good now.
Hold on.
Okay.
Yeah.
And he showed to me a river.
And a river of water of life.
And it was shining.
It was crystal.
I just want to keep going.
And it was coming out of the throne of God
and the sheepskin.
And in the middle of this road,
there was this tree on both sides of the river.
And what happened?
It made these fruits.
It produced these 12.
It made these 12 fruits.
They produced according to each season.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the leaves.
They're for what?
For therapy.
They're for therapy.
This is medicine, people.
It's the tree of life.
What did you think we were doing?
Go to the next one.
Boom.
I just want to keep reminding people.
And every curse, look,
and every curse is going to go away.
Do you know why he says that?
Every curse is going to go away.
Now you evangelicals, you're thinking,
because this is from the Bible, right?
This is, this is the revelation or the apocalypse.
Right?
What's the curse that's going to,
it is the sin, my son.
It is the sin of the world being taken.
No.
You moron.
We're talking about a healing cult.
Yeah.
And those curses, they cause disease.
They cause disease.
You don't look at the world that way, do you?
No.
Because you don't know what curses are
and how to use them.
And thank goodness you don't.
Thank goodness you don't.
Let's go to the next one.
Next one, Chewie.
We can't teach best to advance.
Next thing you know, we'll be having outbreaks
and all sorts of things.
And you know, look, these words are true
and faithful.
The Lord God sent out his angel.
Right?
And what's this angel going to do?
He's going to show to the slaves of Jesus.
He's going to show the slaves of Jesus.
The thing that's going to happen,
whatever's going to happen, man.
And it's going to be quick.
What's coming soon?
He's going to show him.
He's going to show him.
And he says,
Hey, pay attention.
This is Jesus.
I'm coming.
Morningstar.
I'm coming, he says.
I'm coming quickly.
And what's going to happen?
Blessed is the one who guards the logoi,
who guards those words.
Logus.
What words?
Words of the prophets.
Yeah.
Okay.
Words of the prophecies of what?
This book.
Those who guard these prophecies are the ones
who were following the mystery.
And by that,
I do not mean sitting in your movie theater,
watching your show,
the Cummings massacre,
or whatever you call it,
getting off the boat late.
What did they used to call that thing?
That idiot that was in that sitcom in the 80s
was big into it.
Some author made a gaggle of money
writing about the fear of the coming.
Here it comes.
So much so that I had a relative ask me,
would I watch your dogs
when Jesus comes back to get her?
People.
People.
The fairytale.
The fairytale is dragging you into idiocy.
Do you know what the people said
when Peter and John showed up in the city
to preach?
Do you know what they said?
These are Greeks.
I don't know about you,
but these two bozos are idiots.
They're illiterate.
They're illiterate.
Did you know that all the time
that Jesus spent with those boys,
he didn't once give an alphabeta gamma?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Go to the next one.
We've got to get work.
We're coming down to the back stretch, Gnostic.
Just give me a second.
I'm coming in.
Blessed are those who wash their gowns
in order that the force,
the forceful essence of this
from that tree might come upon them.
Right?
After they get it,
we can go into the city through the gates, right?
You want to go to the city through the gates?
Got to have the water of life, boneheads.
What's outside of all this?
All of us.
Look, we're all sitting here satanic congregation.
We know what we've got.
We've had the water of life.
Who are the boneheads?
Who are the boneheads?
There are a bunch of other people, says Jesus.
We're trying to do the same thing.
Wait.
What?
Yeah.
The people who are against this, they're all cuneists.
Dogs.
And everybody translates that the same.
Dogs.
Dogs.
Why would he say dogs?
Why would he say dogs?
Jesus.
You got something against dogs?
I come to thank you, but I never saw Jesus
ever pet a dog.
And that makes me sad because I love dogs.
Jesus Christ bend over.
That's for being mean to dogs.
But it's not really his fault.
Because these cuneists that he's talking about,
this is a select group.
This is a known group.
Hercules is accompanied where he goes
by his Phoenician dogs.
Yeah.
Do you know who the enemy is?
To this Christ who is Venus, whose mother was the
