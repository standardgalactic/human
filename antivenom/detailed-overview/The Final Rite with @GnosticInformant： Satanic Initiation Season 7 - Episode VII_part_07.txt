the Persians and the Romans.
That's where you see this blending happening
and you see Sebasius.
That's the home of Sebasius.
And even Clement of Alexander is saying,
Sebasius is a counter sign,
because the way Sebasius was worshiped,
it's like Zeus and Dionysus rolled into one.
It's like a Godhead, like Jesus and the Father, right?
And Clement's looking at this and Clement's saying,
this is a counter sign of the mysteries of Christ, right?
He's saying, they're copying Jesus.
That's what he's saying.
And Justin Marley uses the same apologetic crap,
where he tries to say, oh, Mithras, he says,
what does he say?
He says, you know, how Hermes is called the logos,
all that stuff that looks like Jesus, it's not.
They're copying us.
You want to know why they have to say that?
Because they don't have a choice,
because they know it's either one way or the other.
So they have to argue for that side,
because they don't have a choice.
They know that these son of God rights
are being applied to Jesus.
It's the other way around.
So that's where you start.
You see, apologetics starts off early.
Apologetics is not a modern thing that you just see today,
where you see people being called apologists
online or on Twitter.
No, no, no.
Christian apologetics started from day one.
You don't see pagan apologetics.
You don't see, they don't care.
They're not trying to win.
You're either initiated or you're not.
You know what I mean?
You're either a bucket or you're not.
It's not really like that.
You were talking a little bit earlier.
You mentioned a couple of points that I wanted to bring up
that were super strong areas like gold.
You just mentioned Macrobius.
And let me give a plug to Macrobius.
Get out there and take a look at him.
You want to see some of that real cult stuff.
You know what I mean?
That's where it is.
Beautiful, marvelous source.
There's one.
I want to send people to one.
Drakontius.
Nobody reads Drakontius.
Playwright, right?
Playwright.
He's not technically a playwright.
He's a dude who's exercising himself
by writing very short little playlets.
Yeah, I think more of a grammarian than anything else.
You know, anywho, you've got to see some of the titles that he uses.
The people of Rome understood.
For example, they call Medea scutha.
Right?
What is that from?
It's from the fact that she's working in that region as the queen.
Right?
Again, it's the thing you mentioned that was so important
that people I think need to hear is the Bacchic Empire.
You can watch this thing.
How are they promoting and pushing the power of the Bacchic Empire?
It's with the oracles.
With the oracles.
This system of oracles is consistent throughout Europe,
throughout the Mediterranean, right?
All over North Africa.
The Sybil.
Yeah.
They combine.
That's what happens in Alexandria.
They're taking all these texts from these different Sybils
and putting them all into one book.
That's kind of where you get the Judeo-Christian religion from.
It comes from the Sybiline tradition.
That's why you see all these prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah.
It's all destruction.
God's going to come and destroy you.
That's what you get in the Sybiline oracles, you know?
The guy who wrote the Torah and other parts in the third century,
that guy is borrowing so heavily from everything around.
I didn't mention it tonight, Gnostic, but I want to ask you this.
I want to ask you this.
They've got how many, how many of those gems do they carry?
How many of those sacred stones do they carry?
Do you know what the lithica has?
It has the powers.
It has the powers of the stones from the Bronze Age
before there was Moses, before there was Abraham,
before there was anybody proposed it wise.
This is ancient history.
That's what they call it, Zodiacal Perfection, the 12.
You see that all across the board.
It's just obvious.
Sybiline oracles, this is not even a secret,
because the Sybiline oracles are still continuing to be written
by Christians all the way into the 15th century,
where they talk about the fall of Constantinople going to happen.
They didn't even hide that the tradition comes from the Sybiline text.
They called the first Christian Sybilis, right?
That's what Kelsus was saying.
When he starts listing off the groups of Christians,
the first thing he says, they're called Sybilis,
they're called Simonians, Marcianites.
He lists the Sybilis first.
You know how you read the back of an ingredient
and it starts with the biggest ingredients first,
and it'll say like, oh, sugar, citric acid, blah, blah, blah.
Whatever the most of it is, he's always listed first.
That's how you do stuff.
He said Sybilis first before he said anything else.
That says something about the tradition of Christianity
where it comes out of.
It comes out of that Alexandrian middle Platonist world,
Stoics and Platonist clashing.
That's what is theology.
It's Greek.
This is what amazes me.
I met somebody who's a theology PhD who even he said,
I'm surprised I even have a theology degree.
They should just call my degree something else
because we don't learn any theology and we don't learn any Greek.
He said, I don't know anything about Presocratics.
I don't know anything about Plato, but I'm a theology PhD.
That's like calling yourself a surgeon
and not knowing how to use a scalpel.
Like, what's going on?
Like, how do you do that?
Funny. It's hilarious, Neil.
I can't believe that you're in that milieu
that you're able to smell that funk.
I love that. Isn't that amazing?
I'm going to smell it on any guests that ever come
in the future on your show.
I'm going to smell them before they come in.
Did you, I just want people,
I want the Satanic congregation to recognize
the use of source work here.
See, there's no ideas.
Neil didn't dream this up.
He didn't sit around and say,
hmm, what kind of book can I write
to make myself some frigging money and status?
He didn't do that.
He's just going, look, look at the sources.
And he can give you an accurate picture, right?
That other people who are so-called scholars
can't keep up with, right?
Let's give Neil the kudos that he deserves.
He, you know, I'm going to say this, Neil.
You told me this in confidence,
but I don't think you'd mind me saying it.
Some other who saw somewhere else with a degree
and a professorship said, wow,
how is, how is Gnostic Informance so well-informed
in the sources, right?
As if it belongs to them.
As if they can take these materials
and make whatever they want
and put stupid ideas in your head
when somebody who's ronin' from the outside comes in.
It's a huge threat.
Look, look what your audience is way bigger than theirs.
Well, because they in a hundred years ago,
a hundred years ago,
if you were living in the time of France,
or, you know, whatever,
Carl Jung or somebody,
you had to be,
you had to go to university to get books.
You're not going on Amazon.
You're not reading them online.
And now everybody has the power.
You can go online.
You can get a Greek tutor on Wizzent.
You can learn Greek and Hebrew.
You can learn everything you want from your computer.
And you can read the text.
They're all translated.
You have, people have no,
you don't need to pay $40,000 to be,
to learn this stuff.
Maybe if you want to be an expertise in one specific area,
then go ahead.
Knock yourself out.
Go in debt for the rest of your life.
But if you just want,
like you don't have to do,
you don't have to go in debt to learn this stuff.
I'm just saying,
I don't call myself an expert in anything,
but I will say I'm pretty confident in like,
basic understanding of a lot of these subjects.
You know?
Yeah.
You can tell them,
Neil, next time you talk to anybody
that you want to flash your badge,
you tell them you officially have a master's degree
from Satanic you.
Very good.
And if you want them to play with you in the sources,
you welcome them in.
And then Neil, Neil, you never,
you never lighten up.
When you go in,
you smash the hell out of them.
Do you understand?
You take that ground and you show them,
this is my dojo.
You know what I mean?
You show them,
show them the way.
And you can do that with the sources.
Everybody sees that tonight.
Look,
there are a lot of BS artists out there.
There are a lot of people with degrees
and with titles
that you and I don't have.
And those people will tell you this is the way it was.
And all you got to do is watch.
Look what,
look what Neil did with the sword tonight.
He slayed.
He totally slayed.
He gave a picture of antiquity
that was razor sharp.
And Neil, I could taste it.
I was getting all riled up,
kind of aroused by the whole situation,
you know, intellectually speaking.
And to see Paul cite Medea is pretty,
pretty hilarious because you can't escape.
There is no escaping.
If you're writing in Greek,
and even,
even just not even just the quote,
that's from Medea,
even just writing words in Greek,
you're going to start,
you're going to run into the technical cultic terms
like Eucharist or Baptist.
Stuff that you find in the Ellisonian Mysteries
and the Mithraic Mysteries,
Samlethration Mysteries,
all this stuff comes from this.
How many times has Paul talked about mystery?
The word mystery itself
comes from the ancient mystery rights.
It didn't mean,
it didn't mean like solve a riddle of a,
of a novel in that mystery,
the religion,
that's what it meant.
That's what that word meant.
How many preachers out there?
Do you think Neil,
or how many priests and preachers know
that Paul quoted Medea?
How, how many do you think?
Not many.
They think it was,
because they're,
most of them know about Epimenides,
but they know Epimenides was citing Medea.
Zero.
I'll bet you,
I'll bet you every,
I'll bet my degree
against every degree
at Dallas Theological Seminary.
Do you hear me?
I left Dallas Theological Seminary
because their Greek program was so bad.
You were there?
Yes, I started.
I started.
What year was this?
In their THD program.
Oh, I think it was the early 90s.
I enrolled in their THD program.
I'm just trying to imagine
you in Dallas Theological Seminary.
The first day I got there,
the first day I got there,
this guy who lived on the same floor,
came in and he was like,
can I sit down?
I was like, sure, brother,
go ahead.
And he said,
can you tell me your secret sins?
Oh, wow.
And I was like, no, man,
I got some Greek to study.
I think that's one of the institutions
where you have to sign.
I know the SPL does this,
but I think they do it too,
where you have to sign the Statement of Faith.
Well, of course.
The Statement of Faith is like,
you will preach Jesus Christ was crucified
