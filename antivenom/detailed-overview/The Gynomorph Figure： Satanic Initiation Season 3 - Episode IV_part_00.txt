I never meant anything I said, just spitting it up
Everything I've been feeding, keeping from eating away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should have said

I want you to settle in and I want you to take a look at religion
Religion is a wormhole
It is a multi-dimensional collapsible bridge in space
That only a 13-year-old girl in the bloom of life can open
And only when she has entered a state of height and sexual arousal
When I started writing this
