You always want to put your footnotes down and your sources
So this is an attempt to bridge that gap
Yeah
According to ancient Etruscan symbols
The teenage priestesses who established the norms for much of Roman culture
Religion is a method of cosmic tunneling
It's a practice that creates a fluid structure
Through which dark matter breathing beings
Can travel in order to possess their maddened devotees
The ancient world believed religion was a resonant span across the fabric of space-time
And ancient clerics thought that its thermodynamic seal could be forcefully broken open
With the songs of maidens
People are always talking about what religion is
And when we look at religion and antiquity
We're looking through our modern lens
Christianity of antiquity is nothing even remotely similar to what you see today
So when we're looking at texts that have to do with strange concepts
We have to be careful, we have to be very literate
We have to insist upon a scientific approach
This is all from reason, right?
The Romans spoke classical Latin
Their word religio
From which we derive our English word religion
Means ligature or binding
This is important
Religion is not what you think it is
Modern historians, overly influenced by their own Christian cultural lens
Have interpreted this to mean religion
Is something that binds us to do and to say certain things in celebration of divinity
In other words, religion is what we owe the god or the gods
Nothing could be further from the historical actuality
Let's get out and taste the air a little bit
In Rome, religio was simply the cosmic tie that bound the earth plane to the rest of the multiverse
It was a means to an end
It was a force of extra-dimensional attraction
Yeah, yeah
Let's talk about demons
Let's talk about demons
I want you to be getting in the place of the ancient practitioner
The importance of demons
The ancient Mediterranean world taught the priestesses, witches, diviners, and poets
Possessed the ability to open portals
