Through which sentient powers or demons who inhabited extra-worldly planes
Could travel to the material universe
These beings, these powers that be, did not have a physical form
And remember, we can go through all of the scientific texts
We can go through all the Aristotle you want
We can go through all the... talking about Democritus
We can go through all the traditional Greek ways of learning
To support what this is saying
Are you ready?
These beings, these powers that be, did not have a physical form
They were not composed of atoms
They were not composed of atoms, the indivisible elements of our world
That's ancient, it's not modern
And they did not have eyes, ears, mouths, voices, or in fact any human or biological attribute at all
And perhaps most importantly, these immortals were neither male nor female
They were neither, and they were both
In the Greco-Roman way of thinking, gods are the cosmic bloom of existence
Which only makes sense, right?
It only makes sense that divinity would be that moment at which the perfection is displayed
Yes, you see how everything goes back to Aphrodite? Love it
In the Greco-Roman way of thinking, gods are the cosmic bloom
Greek and Latin culture, preserved in the amber of ancient literature
Perpetuated the view that gods are the immortal elements of an ordered and living universe
They are the elements of an ordered and living universe, the Orphics
Prayed to that cosmos, that organization which they called Fusus
Nature, nature
And you see right away why Paul the Apostle is so angry
Running around saying, stop worshiping nature
Get your mind off of nature, because even the Christians who had entered the cult
Were still influenced by their upbrings, by their education
Yeah, and if they didn't have any of that, they had what was in the ether around them
Myth was the medium in which the classical world expressed the efflorescence of the immortal forces of the universe
Greek and Roman myth had an extraordinary influence on ancient artists, statesmen, religious leaders, and philosophers
It was a cultural cement that facilitated the construction of democracy
The establishment of a system of education and the creation of what became the scientific method
Ancient myth was a metaphor for expressing the individuality and actions of the immortal powers that govern the universe
There was no difference between their philosophers and their physicists
There was no difference
The doctors had to stand on both sides of that divide
The doctors had to know the pharmacology, they had to know which drugs did what
But they also had to know the theories that Galen goes into ad nauseam
Yes, the medical theories and the medical powers, the powers of things
