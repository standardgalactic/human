So a lot of this talk about demons fits right in with their religion, which is very different
When you talk about a mystery and the performance of a mystery and antiquity
You're talking about a specific event for which you cannot create a proper representation using modern terms
You can't, you have to go there
The goal is the orgasm
And you say, wait a minute, what? I didn't think church had anything to do with orgasm
Right, that's why they threw out Aphrodite
They severed that connection within the mystery and from that point on, you have a terrible enslavement of the feminine
It's gorgeous, I want to read you one, another section here, I'm going to skip ahead
I just want to read to you about the bi-gendered god
The bi-gendered god, the gyneomorph was a bi-gendered god with both masculine, physical and feminine attributes
The word itself is just a pairing of gyna, woman and morph shape
Literally a gyneomorph is a god with female shape
Additionally, the gyneomorph was a developed or evolved state of feminine divinity or daimon, demon in English
Gyneomorphs were portrayed as effeminate young males like Dionysus
These are the ones they're outlawing in China right now, right? They're trying to get rid of effeminate males
I hope that this YouTube live is banned in Tennessee, I hope it's banned in Tennessee
Gyneomorphs retain the creative capacity of their feminine forms
They had cosmic wombs, but they also possessed the inseminating abilities attributed to the masculine god
Gyneomorphs were special because they stood in the gender gap between male and female gods
Gyneomorphs formed a bridge between the sexes, they were a combo, or the sum, of both genders
In this way, gyneomorphs were hermaphroditic and could appear sometimes as predominantly masculine or other times as predominantly feminine
The gyneomorph was an important figure in ancient culture
Because the Greco-Roman world, and I'm going to say something that's going to shock you and you're not going to believe until I show you examples
Or until you find examples and come back to me and say, you're right
The Greco-Roman world possessed no word for gender
They also didn't possess a word for homosexuality
That's a later creation, it's only when you persecute something, can you name it and identify it
If something is not persecuted, it doesn't need to be identified, it's just part of society
And that's how the Greeks were, you remember Achilles?
There's no question that he was involved with men and women
There's no reference to what that ism is, it doesn't exist
I'll give you a clue though, the Christians created one
The monotheistic religions always come up with a way
With the way of taking that group of people and defining them and vilifying them
They throw drug users in there with them, that's the way it is
Lovely universe you've got, say those who are watching
They viewed sex not as a binary proposition but as a natural sum of two cooperative potentials
Isn't that interesting? Yeah, it's not binary, it's not binary at all
Yeah, right, nice, it's a range, it's a scale which makes sense because the Greeks were such students of balance
Such students of balance, that was mesmerizing, thanks for that video
In their view sexual attributes were a combination of both masculine and feminine qualities
