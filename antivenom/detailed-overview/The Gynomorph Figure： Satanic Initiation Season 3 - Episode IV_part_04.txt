There were no absolute sexual characteristics or combinations for this reason
Their closest word to English gender is kind
That's about the closest you can get, kind
Yeah, fantastic
What are the origins of necromancy? What does this have to do with necromancy?
Because that's why everybody's come here is to get involved in necromancy, right?
So at least that's what you seem to be reflecting
The earliest origins of Western necromancy are found in the practices of Etruscan priestesses and prophets
These wates or seers were able to divine the future based on their reading of natural signs
They believed cosmic intelligences freely communicated with mortals
And they thought that proper interpretation of signs like lightning strikes and the flight of birds
Was the provenance of specialized clerics
These same clerics worship gynomorphic gods, there we are, there's the connection
And perpetuated myths of bi-gendered divine entities
Necromancy was extremely popular during birth and early development of Christianity
Raising the dead was a common practice of Roman and Greek religious figures
And was a well-established ritual by the time Jesus entered the stage of Western history
Necromancers perform sacred sexual acts meant to summon and drive out demons from the afflicted
Sacra pigiacchia is the Latin term, so for those of you who say
I need a source and I need, there's an actual, you don't get better evidence than this
An actual word in Latin for sacred sodomy
Think about that for a minute
This is not unusual because in Roman weddings, when your 14-year-old girl is marrying a 30-year-old ex-veteran
It's traditional for her to be able to offer the anus as an alternative to vaginal penetration
It's a courtesy because it's a scary process
And the Romans thought it was, it should be up to her to choose
And when she's ready, she will offer the other
But until then, just, you know, yeah, that's the way it's going to be
And St. Augustine hated this, he hated it, he was so much against this practice, right?
And he said they go up during the wedding and they sit, they sit on the phallus, they sit on the priapus
Yeah, it was, as soon as you can call them sodomites, you've got it
You've got a group that you can latch on to and you can burn the city down for
Right, isn't that what we all desire as first-century Christians?
We've got to burn down Rome, that's what they said
People now are calling for civil war, right?
This happens through history
There are forces that call for the decline, for the toppling of the government
And the Romans, the Romans fought that force, they fought it hard
They pushed for civilization, they pushed for it
And it was only, it was only when the Christians took the extra step
Everybody, everybody, I'm telling you, I've been reading these texts a long time
And everybody thinks the fairy tale is the actuality
