They think the Romans are walking around with their gale, oh, and stomping around their uniforms
Putting people on crosses, throwing people to the tigers
Yeah, letting people get killed
You know, the only time they took on the Christians and put them in the arena with other criminals
Is when they stood against the government
When they stood against the government, right?
They didn't care who Jesus was
They didn't give anything, this was some backwater province
That was way out of control, that had no tradition
That even came close to what the Romans considered civilization
And these people don't have toilets, brah
They don't have toilets, right?
Much less, how do you get there? The roads are terrible
They got no administration, they got nothing, their courts are terrible
You can be stoned by a crowd of people
This is hillbilly world, right?
This is, they didn't care about it
So-and-so, the greatest king of the world, they didn't care about that, right?
It's when the Christians stood against the government
When the insurrection started, right?
When the violence started, right?
And that inevitably was catapulted everybody forward
In time to a place where the Romans get swamped
And there's people who try to stop it along the way
There's intellectuals, there's people who are government people
Who try to stop it, see if we can keep this insurrectionist mood out
Right? Preserve the republic
You don't go in and defecate on the statue of the republic
Wild animals, yeah, yeah
Those are the ones you feed to the tigers
Right? Thomas Jefferson got this
Thomas Jefferson got this when he said you have to take
The leader of the insurrection, that tyrant
And you gotta sacrifice him to liberty
You gotta sacrifice him, if you don't, justice doesn't stay with you
She leaves, and once justice leaves your society, you're done for
You're done for
Those are classical ideas
Classical ideas
Yeah, I want to continue with the origin of necromancy, I'm sorry
The purpose of ancient western religion was to open a means of communication
With the realms of the gods
