We'll have a good class tomorrow
A good Greek class tomorrow
Everybody keep reading your sources
Don't forget a little Oscar Wilde
The supplement of little Euripides
Every once in a while
And don't be afraid
I gave an interview earlier today
And I sensed a fear in the air
I sensed a real fear
That was only balanced by the courage
Of a whonastic informant
Who doesn't want
Who doesn't want to do anything
But bring the reality
Bring the reality
Yeah, thankfully there are those people out there
And let's honor the muse
And let's bring this
Now, we're going to take a step up
And we're going to start with the cup
We're going to start making the cup
So I'm very much looking forward to our next meeting
Thank you very much for coming tonight
I appreciate your time
Thank you, Chewie, for all the help
And everybody, Hail Satan
When I say never met nobody
No harm when I say
Never was a cause for a long
Maybe you'll understand
What I meant something
Maybe I won't do
Just put on different masks
And ask the questions
