It's koo-fi
Koo-fi?
What's koo-fi?
Oh, everybody knows what koo-fi is
There's formula for koo-fi all over
From the first century BC until third
It's a fad
Koo-fi is a fad
Man, these formulae are fads
I want to show you some texts
I'm bringing you some of this
But we've got the koo-fi burning in the air
Because we have a Holy Spirit
We have a Holy Spirit
This is all about fire
And the breath of fire
There's one of us that can do this
Better than anyone else
Her name is Medea
This is the breath of fire
I come from all the way across the Mediterranean
It took me three months to get here
Three months
A couple of times, things were pretty perilous
Ran out of food at one point
It was terrible
Three months we came
Why did we come to see her?
Because she is the one who can breathe the fire
She's the one
Fantastic
Take those three deep breaths in
As you behold those solar rays
Remember, this is the first thing in the morning
Dawn bringers
You mean the early Christians were Luciferians?
You mean the early Christians? Yes
The first Christians were bringers of dawn
Who followed a man who was arrested in a public park
With a naked kid who called himself
Did you ever catch Jesus' gangster name?
Did you ever catch it?
Yeah, give me a morning star
Morning star
That's his name
That's his pop within the cult
That's his pop within the cult
So where are we? Where is our daughter?
Where is our daughter?
She's right now under the protection
Of these substances
That we are fumigating her with
She is under the protection of the gods
This is gorgeous, love it, love it
I'm gonna read you a little bit more
After we're able to start everything off
What happens?
That the sacred spirit may breathe in me
So that I may wonder at the sacred fire
That I may gaze upon the unfathomable
Awesome water of the dawn
The unfathomable awesome water of the dawn
Yeah, that's why you're bringing your daughter here
Yeah, gorgeous, fantastic
I today am about to behold
With immortal eyes
Do you know what the magic is doing?
The magic is doing what the tree in Edom did
The magic is doing what the tree in Edom did
It's bringing you back
Bringing you back
Memory
Nemosony
Bringing you back
Yeah
Since it is impossible for me
Born immortal
Born immortal of a mortal womb
A womb, a matrix
What is that, who stood on?
That's a matrix
It's a matrix for the life
Okay, so when the text talks about the daughter being born again
Being brought to life, to a stage of life
That's after having entered death
Good, good, I want you to see
As we dive in, as we keep going
As we keep going deeper
What kind of force are we looking for?
There's a brightness and immortal brilliance
From this Alpha to Omega
Drawing breath from the stars
Drawing up three times from the rays
Three times
For in that day and hour
You will see the divine order of the skies
What is that divine order of the skies?
Now, those of you with the edition that I'm reading from
Which is the Hans Dieter Betts' edition
Part of which John Scarborough translated
Those of you who have that
You're one step away
You're one step away, but remember, you're still a step away
You're not receiving that pure stream
You're receiving it filtered
So what is this thing?
Is that what it says? That's not what it actually says
Is it? I've got it up here
I'm going to search my Greek for it today
I'm not quite sure what order
Perhaps it's this one
Oh, it is, good job
Look at this, do you see the last word?
Thessen
That's from Thesses, you could say an organization
A divine organization
Horas
Horas
And there's your problem
That's not the cosmos
That's not the cosmos
No, no, no, it's not
It's not
Sorry, I'm going to get you these backwards
Look, don't look at it
So backwards
Oh, I'm so sorry
