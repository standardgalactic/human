Where's my...
It's in here somewhere
I guess I didn't put that one in there
The Horas is any time
that is a cycle
Think of the loop
The Greeks were able to envision
a single abstract concept
of the completion of a cycle
The completion of a cycle
That is the Horas
You have 12 of these during the day
Did you know you completed 12 cycles during the day?
No, it's probably because you didn't also know
that you complete 12 cycles in a year
Right?
Those Horai
are the guardians
Those completed cycles
are the sister guardians
of the gates of Uranos
Okay, stop and think
You're sitting on your throne
I didn't say it this time, but everybody should be
sitting on their throne
Can you see those Horai?
Can you see them?
The completion of a circuit
This is
what I call
gynecological time
It's the member of the species
that can bring life from death
that orders time
Not the masculine
Isn't that interesting?
Interesting
We're well-buried
within a mystery rite
that has a feminine foundation
Evangelicals
Here's a warning, you're not going to like this
Your cult
is a late, late, late development
from a woman's science
meant to bring salvation
Soteria
to the world
Yeah
Thank female physicians
You've been worshiping a man
when your entire art
is based upon the work
of female physicians
The mystery
is not a mystery
like Sherlock Holmes
needs to solve
It's an operation
and now we have the specifics
and the drugs
So, we've got to go ahead
This is the second half
We're right at the pole
This is the second half
So, we're entering this phase
of the initiation
We go forward with the indictment
We go forward with the indictment
Good, I want to read you
a couple more images here
just to get you further
You can see her
You can see her being initiated
She's already developed the drug
The koofy's already burning
The angels have already been added
Yes
Symbol of the living
Yes, make himself low
Then you will see
the gods looking gracious upon you
and no longer rushing
at you
rather going about in their order of affairs
So, when you see the world
above is clear and circling
and that none of the gods
or angels is threatening you
expect to hear a great crash
of thunder
So, as to shock you
then say again, silence
silence
and that's where we ended
We've got her to that point
I want you to bring her now
to that final place
of vision
I want you to go to that place
that knocks out all the prophets
that causes them to
not her
not her
Gorgeous
Gorgeous
When you have said this, the rays
will turn toward you
Look at the center of them
for when you have done this
you will see a youthful god
beautiful in appearance
with fiery hair
and in a white tunic
and a scarlet cloak
and wearing a fiery crown
at once
greet him with the fire
that's that nice
you can see him
ride everybody
this is Jesus
this is Jesus
coming in
open up your
apocalypse and take a look
at how Jesus is represented
