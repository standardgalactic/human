of it you know
it's one that you can burn

if you've got asthmatic problems
right if you've got breathing problems
you know if it irritates your lungs
then
you can
you can also swallow it
they have a nice cup
he says
we're able to drink it
this is diascortes now
switch back this is back in time
you know um a little bit
Galen has collected
a whole bunch of stuff and he really values
diascortes
is the drug dude
right he's the one who
puts together the world's best
encyclopedia of drugs this guy is on the mark
right so he has a koofy
recipe as well
he has the type that is
um he says is compounded
for the sake of the
you know the fumigation
yeah right and he says
it's most
most beloved or most
valued by the gods
wait
wait what a minute this pharmacist
yeah this is a pharmacist
slash physician
slash drug expert yeah
and you wouldn't put him in that category
don't try to make him a shaman
diascortes is not a shaman
diascortes is the death of the shaman
I've got the shaman right here

he's so deep I got him so deep
in the dungeon I got everybody's
dirty smelly hippie shaman

yeah and it's used
you know by the egyptian
priests right they use
it to instigate baby

experts in this stuff right
and it's used as
a mixture with antidotes
so again I told you guys
about the dot antidote

is standing in the place
of our theriac that we talked
about before that we've got
andromicus from
using right we've got
him with the formula
for that right and he's
gotten them from
I forget who
what general it was a Pompey
or something who got him from the east
I can't remember but they come back
down to Nero
through andromicus and here we have
yeah um yeah
so for the asthmatics he says
it's given him a drink
yeah yeah yeah and he says
there's lots of different preparations
of it but most people use
at least these this base
ingredient list
and then he goes on
