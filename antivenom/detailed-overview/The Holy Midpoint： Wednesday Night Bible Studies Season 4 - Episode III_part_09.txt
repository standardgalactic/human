did it escalate
yeah
it escalated over time
and it started getting more
hands on
grabbing you by the shirt
grabbing me by the neck
and getting real really aggressive
I was in there getting beat on
with a paddle, no clothes
it's like real life getting beat
I want people to speak up like I'm doing
I'm right here talking to you right now
my face is on display right now
about what happened to me
tell your story, your story matters
it really do count
what does the future look like for you
but the future look like for me
uh
you know how many stars
is in the universe
so my future is just
too many options
my future is in my hands
it's actually in my hands
laughter
laughter
in all seriousness
laughing of the
Dalai Lama
with the indwelling Buddha aside
after the kiss
or the tongue suck me
thing whatever that suck my tongue
thing was
in all seriousness
it's that kid that you and I are
really working for
the trans
dimensional
district attorney's office
is the one that's going to bring charges
right
on behalf of that
child
that was with Jesus in the public part
Jesus has gotten all the press
right
that kid is completely
on the outside if it were up to the Christians
they would have buried him a long time ago
right and just gotten rid of him
but we
because we fight
for justice
right we are pagans
we still believe
in the goddess justice
and we need
to fight for that kid
we need to fight for this guy
right and the long
line of children that Jesus Christ
and his followers
have victimized
it's a fight
it's a fight against everything that
is beautiful and it's
the same fight that the Romans were
waging in the first century when the Christians
burned down the city
thank you for coming tonight
we will be
forging ahead
with another
necromancy
to follow
I'm told that because we're in the second
half
of the push toward the apocalypse
that we have to speed things up
now so I'm going to have to start
bringing in witnesses
and it might get ugly
things might get a little bit
strange I need you to sit
with me on that throne
and I need us not to forget
those Chaldean principles
right the Chaldean principle of who
you are you don't know who you are
says Dionysus that's the problem
you don't know who you are
yeah we need to
realize who we are
we need to look into the mirror
we need to be well capable
of that performance
in order to get there we're going to bring
back the dead and
it might be scary
it might be scary
it should be shouldn't any time
that you bring that you perform necromancy
shouldn't it be a little bit
a little bit across the plane please
have your asterian
stay on the throne so that we can
stay submerged in those deep
things I appreciate
your time
in honoring the deep things of
Satan and I say
have a good night Hail Satan
