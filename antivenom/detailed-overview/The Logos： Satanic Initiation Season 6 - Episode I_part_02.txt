This is good.
What am I reading to you tonight?
What source was that that I'm flashing up in front of you?
What is the voice of John who says, I am not the one ox Christos.
I am not the one ox Christos hit me with the one ox.
It's the next Greek from Alice.
Blow that up.
Sure.
Thanks.
Fantastic.
Look at this guys for all of the Greek students.
Look at just the first thing you get under a, do you see that the F looking letter on
there?
That's the Greek diagram.
Yeah.
Now you know why I'm saying one ox.
You're like, well, is the W and you don't know where it is.
Right?
Um, there it is.
There it is.
Well, is it?
There it is.
Look at the one a case.
You know what the one a case are?
One a case.
Oh, God.
Those are the savior gods.
And if you have any brains when you're at sea, you will have honored this one a case.
Oh, God.
Love this stuff.
Isn't it culty?
Fantastic.
It just, it brings up so much.
Let's go to another, another poet, please pull in the Greek.
Look what we're looking at people.
This is what I'm showing you tonight.
This is known as the penopolis, his metabolite of John.
What is a metabolite?
Oh, you'll see it defined various and send me ways.
Yeah.
Um, why don't we just say, um, it is a, an exchange of transformation, a restatement
to retelling a decomposition and recomposition metabolite.
Nobody cares about titles and none of these titles are original.
So forget about it.
What is this thing?
It's the gospel of John written by someone who is deep knee deep in the flood of classical
cult.
This guy knows more about Bacchus than anybody for the last 500 years.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
People debate.
It's so disturbing that people debate.
Was he a Christian?
Was he a pagan?
Was he, and the scholars came up with this idea.
They said, Hey, he's a crypto pagan, right?
Cause they got, we got nothing better to do than to sit in the rooms and say, let's make
up some words, bro.
Right?
Crypto pagan.
What does that mean?
It means he would have never gotten his stuff published if he had not said he was a Christian.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
And we have in the most beautiful cult terminology, the gospel of John, you'll find the miracles
suddenly.
Oh, it makes sense.
Oh my God.
How long were we waiting to break that seal?
Love it.
Give me another Greek text.
Let's just, oh, let's just bathe in it tonight.
This is lovely.
We're going to see.
Take, take down.
I want everybody to remember.
You read this first line.
What is he doing to this?
Who are these?
Who are those servants?
What's he doing?
He's ordering around the servants to get busy and what to get busy in the dipsados and lapines
in the communion of the viper.
Wait, wait, wait.
