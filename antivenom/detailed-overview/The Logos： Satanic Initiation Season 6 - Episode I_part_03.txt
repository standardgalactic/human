Don't forget this.
Jesus is the one who makes the crack.
Jesus is the one who knows the formula.
Jesus has the burning purple and here he's supposed to be given it to the folks.
Yeah.
It's a miracle.
What does he do?
He makes his wife, man.
Oh my God.
That was fantastic.
They call it the banquet.
Now look, you cannot deny this.
The banquet of the viper.
The banquet of the viper, the communion of the viper.
Oh my goodness.
Jesus, can we do that whole viper thing?
No wonder he's always walking around.
Yeah, I'll teach you to not have to worry about poison the snakes.
Yeah.
Druggy.
Did you know he was a druggy?
Watch what John does.
John gets nuts.
Why'd you think he was wearing the outfit of a bucket?
Yeah.
We're going to see him bring up the next one.
This is gorgeous.
Love it.
Did we finish that one?
Yeah.
We finished that previous one.
Here, and look, the logos.
The logos became sarks, right?
This is the beginning of John, right?
The word, the pastors will translate this.
And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
And we bear this glory, right?
Now, and they'll say the ones that really had spent two days in Greek and
in seminary, they'll tell you.
And the word for Jesus coming to be among men is the word to set up a tent.
And it is a reflection of the dent and the wilderness, right?
They really get into that.
But what they don't get into is the whole viper communion.
What's the viper communion?
Well, these are the verses in John.
Now, let's look at how they are translated by known us.
Let's see by this creepy crypto pagan sorcerer.
Next one.
Here it is.
Here is his version of it.
Kylogos auto delestos.
Wait, what is the logos?
What is the logos?
What is the logos?
The logos is self initiated.
Self initiated.
You mean Jesus Christ is the self initiated?
Yep.
Yep.
Right from the beginning.
Culp terminology all over it.
Look at it.
What does he do?
What does the logos do?
In sarcose.
In sarcose.
You know what sarx is?
I love to tell you this because it's dirty.
Sarx.
They translate it.
They translate it as flesh.
But sarx is what contains your innermost dirty desire.
Your dirty filthy dirty thoughts.
Those are the sarx.
Those are the sarx.
Can you feel the flesh?
Can you feel the flesh?
When you're out testifying.
Can you feel the flesh around you?
Can you honor Aphrodite?
Can you appreciate Bacchus?
Do you like democracy?
Yeah.
A little bit of justice.
