A little bit of decay.
Love it.
Let's bring up some more.
Call it up.
It's coming through.
Let's go.
Here's the beginning of John.
Are you guys ready?
Because pastors and preachers love this stuff.
Take notes.
Pastors and preachers take notes.
You're never going to see this again.
In the beginning was the Logos.
And the Logos was with God.
And the Logos was the God.
And this one was in the beginning.
Prostantheon.
With God and the presence of God.
Okay.
Fantastic.
We've all heard that.
We've all heard that.
And what is that Logos?
Can anybody tell me what that Logos is?
What is that, Alice?
How's that way you phrased it?
The inward debate of the soul.
The inward debate of the soul.
The accounting.
The reckoning.
The reason.
The Logos.
So John says in the beginning was the Logos.
And Nona says,
I'll translate that for you.
Next one.

And that Logos is a chronic and unaccessible.
And it dwells within the inexpressible arch.

Exactly indistinguishable from the father.

This is the Presbyteros Cosmoio.
This is that very oldest, most authoritative entity
who is involved with the cosmos, the organization.
We're talking universe.
We're talking everything.
Yeah.
All dimensions.
And if you just look at the bottom of this Greek,
I just want you to see the first word in the first line.
Zoe.
What is inborn within the Logos, he says at the bottom?
Zoe is.
Zoe who is posimelousa.
This Zoe who is, who is given, who gives advantage to all.
This universal life.
Zoe is life in the Septuagint, the text that we just claimed back.
We just kicked down the door and took back.
It says the Elwa's name is Zoe.
The Elwa's name is Zoe.
Zoe is inborn within the Logos.
Now you say, oh, that doesn't sound very Christian to me.
Well, it's not the version that you have received for the last 1600 years of filtration.
Yes, it's not.
But then again, you don't have sex under the influence of drugs when you go to church.
And I'm quite certain that you do not, as a Christian would in the first and second centuries,
