king of this sits on the throne here.
This is his world.
You know what I mean?
He runs things, right?

It's not the earthly kingdom that he's talking about.

They look through the fairy tale.

And we have nothing about them from being around.
Well, don't worry.
They didn't just pop into being through a black hole.
There were migrations and they were involved up with the Aryans.
Yeah.
And the Khmerians, who most people don't study anymore, but this is good.
These guys were from Ukraine.
This is beautiful.
I mean, beautiful.
The peoples are gorgeous.
But remember Bronze Age.

And I want to go to, oh, this should be 17, the last number three that I sent.
Yeah.
This should be, yep.
Yeah.
The waters, which you see, right?
Which the porne, which the prostitute sits on, right?
