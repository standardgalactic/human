that comment about I repeated
something that I had used before.
Yeah.
That was for your wife.
Okay.
My son, my child,
do you imagine
that they will ever again restore
literature or anything excellent?
Satanic congregation,
the time is at hand
when men will live worse than
wild beasts.
For now,
antichrist is at hand
even at the doors
and evil precursors
are kind of
evil precursors.
Evil precursors in the shape
of monstrous doctrines.
Monstrous doctrines.
Unlawful practices.
No better than
the orgies of Bacchus.
Those
must usher in
his advent.
Isn't that delightful?
And whatever things have been represented
by the Greeks and their Tragedians
as Saturn and Thaestes and tantalists
devouring their offspring
and the adipus debauching
his hot mother
and Kennyris, his daughters,
all these fearful enormities
will break in upon
our state.
What do you think?
What do you think, those
Byzantine
folks were up to
writing such things
predicting the future?
What do you think they were all about?
Do you know what it says? It says
in order for the Antichrist to come
in order
for the Antichrist to come.
Yeah.
What must happen?
Those
lawless
rights must
be revealed.
Here they are.
Are you ready for some lawless rights?
Are you ready? Have you gotten ready?
Did you put your perfume on
tonight? Did you put your
cologne in the right places?
Are you
ready? Let's go
see
that world that these texts
are talking about. Give it to me.
Give it to me. And on the way
remember it's Medea
who subjects that child
to death
in order to burn off
their mortality.
Christ
give it to me. Give me
the next one. Are you ready?
Boom. And how are they doing this?
They are
taking those
pharmaceutical
powers.
Those
theriacs. Those compound
substances.
They're using the drugs
to do it.
I'm going to show you Jesus and Paul
involved with a dude
not the same dude.
Involved with a dude who's
crazy.
Are you ready?
Give it to me. And yes
it's new. You
hate the, oh I should do it again.
Come here. What is her name?
What is her name? I don't know.
I'm sensing something. I don't know.
It's sweet. Something Nancy?
There you go Nancy. How's that?
You know what
you should do?
Take him to Cersei.
Clip, clip. Are you ready?
You will lift up serpents
and
drink that
death inducer.
And it won't hurt you. You will put,
now this is the part of the verse we never
talk about, you'll put
your hands on those
who are ill and
they will get
better. They will get
better.
That is Jesus Christ
performing the
mystery.
Performing the mystery.
Mystery involves the death
inducer.
And it involves you entering a state
coming out of it.
And then your interaction with
an eyes open world.
Fantastic.
Fantastic. You mean that's
religion is coming down to pharmaceuticals?
Well that and a lot of sex.
That lot of sex.
And that side gets corrupted.
It's always easy to get corrupted.
And we're going to see who's
involved in it here in a second.
Again, all these are going to be
new references. Are you ready?
Look what's happening to here.
Where are we getting our arrows
people? We're getting our arrows
from the muses.
And what are these
arrows doing? Look at that
second line.
That is a combination
of the purple and
lightning together.
What comes out
of that beautiful, beautiful
muse
what comes out
that direct speech
her arrow is poisoned
with
purple lightning.
Purple lightning.
Do you know what you're not supposed to do
for the mystery?
You're not supposed to reveal.
When you reveal
you become struck
by the lightning.
Apocalypse.
Are you ready for apocalypse? Here's another one.
Give it to me. Give me new stuff.
They want to send new stuff.
I'm going to bring you new stuff. We need to look at
you know me up people.
This is a goddess daughter of
Thymus. Who is Thymus? Thymus is
that miraculous divinity
who
represents the laws
the customs that
keep you and I
from destroying each other.
That is Thymus. You mean those
laws were handed down on the mountain
from a guy watching a bush
burn? No!
That law
principle.
I can hear all of the nerds.
Come here
come here
you Syrians and you Sumerians.
You
You're such
great swallowed you.
Great swallowed you.
Great swallowed you.
What's happening
here?
You know
me is a Sotera.
I want you to look at the top line.
Look at the second to last word.
Does that sound familiar to you if you're a Christian?
It's because it's the word for savior.
Only it's a word that is feminine.
Before there was a man's savior, there was a woman's savior, right?
When Jews and Muslims and Christians all worshiped Aphrodite, yeah, they had no problem
with the uranium power of a woman.
They had no problem with it whatsoever.
Yes.
Do you know what they were into?
They were into gender transitions.
You might say that's forward looking, forward looking.
Yes.
Some, remember Jesus walking around is telling people, some kids are made.
Unix, for the sake of the kingdom of God, right?
Some kids are made that way for that sake, you know what I mean?
The ones that can go through that, good for them, right?
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
What did you think they were doing with all the drugs?
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Okay, this is new.
I promised you new.
I promised you new.
I wanted you to see, you know me, just the Greek term here, and I'm going to look at number
two, loyalty to divine law.
Isn't that nice?
You mean they had divine law before they had Moses?
Yeah, they did.
They did, right?
Personified is the daughter of them.
Just give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Okay, you ready for this?
Are you ready?
I'm going to tell you what this says, and I'm going to tell you where this is from.
It's a command.
It's a command and injunction not to harm my Christ.
