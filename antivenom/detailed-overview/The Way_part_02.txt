Interesting. Interesting. This is from, okay, the Daimon itself frees me.
You mean it's a lytic process? We'll call it a lytic process. Let's see the next one. Can you tell me? Can you tell me Dionysus?
What do you mean the Daimon is there with you? Dionysus now the things he suffers, he says the things that I suffer.
Those things he sees, the Daimon sees because he's there. He's there. And wait a minute. Dionysus, bring in the man of sorrows.
Bring in the man of sorrows. Do we have a creepy Jesus? Bring up creepy Jesus, please. No, you forgot. What are you doing?
There he is. Hello, creepy Jesus. Hello. This is wonderful. Now, you'll notice that he's been Christed.
We're going to look at it in just a second. He's been Christed. And I'm going to show you a text that's going to change your orientation, your quantum orientation.
Are you ready? Get ready. Scary Jesus. He's there. He's doing the purple people. What did you expect? He's a Christ.
He's a Christ. Where's the man of sorrows? Did you bring him back? There he is. And what is the man of sorrows?
He says, I can't see. I can't see the Daimon that's hanging around you. Where is he? Show me. Where is he? I don't see the Daimon.
Does anybody see the Daimon? Does the man of sorrow see the Daimon? No, he doesn't. He doesn't. Dionysus will tell you he's right next to me.
He's right next to me. Can you see him? He's right next to me. You can't see him. Do you know why you cannot see the Daimon next to me?
Because you are a sebes. He's insulting us again. A sebes. You are without sebo. What is the Greek verb sebo? What does it really mean?
First of all, it's usually in the middle voice. The older form is active. People who are taking Greek will love this. It's commonly in the middle voice, sebo mind.
But the older form sebo is an active. So you have to think of it. What does it actually mean? And you'll find when you look it up, it's the opposite.
Are you ready for this? What do I do when I sebo? It's the opposite of what I do when I hubritzo. When I hubris someone.
Wait, and you put your calculator here. Can you feel it? Can you feel your calculator? Oh God, it's kind of vibrating a little bit.
Yeah, hubris. What is it when I do hubris? When I punch you in the face. If I walk up to you in public and punch you in the mouth, that's hubris.
You can be charged with that. It's an assault, we would call it. It's hubris. What is the polar opposite in the Greek mind of the assault?
It's not to take something like your freedom with a punch. That's how they put it. To take away your freedom by putting my hands on you. It's not that. It's not that, no.
It's the opposite. It is to give reverence, to extend recognition. To extend an honor is to sebo. This is the word that is a machine within the classical mystery religion.
It's a machine, and it causes the mystery to take place. Oh God, bring us. What did he say there at the bottom? I just want to make sure I covered that. Did we get everything?
What did he say there, Chewie? Boom. Yeah, bring down the initiative. Okay, yeah. Next to me, right? Because you're our set base, right? We got it. We got it. We're our set base.
Okay. All right. Again, I feel insulted, but I know I have a feeling he's going to do it again. Okay, are you ready? This is our third pitch. This is our third pitch. You got to get this one.
If you don't get this one, you're going to end up with the monests. Are you ready? Dionysus, tell me, who am I? Because when I walked in that temple, when I walked in that temple, it said, know who you are.
Yeah. Okay. So tell me, who am I Dionysus?
What does that translate? You have no idea what kind of life you're living. You have no idea what you're doing. You don't even know who you are.
I knew it. I knew he was going to be negative. I'm going to put my buttocks over here. Shame on me. Hey, you, almond.
Kind of feels better on this side. That's why they do it. I'm starting to get that Victorian. I'm starting to understand the Victorians a little bit better. Okay, let's keep going. We have, you know, it's kind. People are like, look, let's go.
Dionysus, tell me something. What do you want us to do, sir? You what? You want us to put on the purple? Oh, that's fantastic. Give us go to the next one. Oh, God.
Okay, I'm putting on the purple. I know about the rest of you. And where are we going, buddy? Are you ready? Dionysus, this is cool. I get it. I get the insults, right? I totally get it. It's totally cool to be here.
Um, tell me something Dionysus, where are we going? Let's go even hold us. Well, you wait, you want me to go where? Where are we going? One more time. It's an agenda thing, guys.
You know, we've got to go there. It's probably lunchtime. We've got to be there, right? We're going to go to the hood. What? The roads of the void.
The roads of the void. Oh, God. That sounds like a good band or something. You know what I mean? The roads of the void. And what are you going to do? I'm going to lead you there. I'm going to lead you there.
All right. I'm good. Everybody else good. Everybody here who's here is consenting is consenting, right? We're all consenting. I don't care if you're 50 or 15, you're consenting to go watching me. You're consenting to go to the void.
You wanted to find the way. I'm showing you the way. Oh, God. Oh, I get. Let's go to the next one. Let's go to the next one. Dionysus, please, please. What are you going to do to us on the way? Dionysus, he must accept.
Excuse me excuse me. Oh, look at that third word. Now, wait a minute. This is Dionysus speaking, right? Yes. Euripides. What are you doing? What are you doing? Dionysus. He puts Dionysus in the mouth of Dionysus and he says Dionysus, Ec, muesd us.
Wait, he what? I want to ec-muse you. You want to do what?
Mulsus, the bringer, Moses of the song, right?
Because you don't know him because you hear law-given, right?
You don't know any songwriter and all that because he's a character that was based upon Museus, right?
The muse is everything in the mystery.
She is the invisible diamond.
The invisible diamond.
Yeah, yeah. I had something nice. I had something nice coming back.
I'm going to stop for a minute. I'm going to tell you a little personal story.
I don't usually include personal stories, but this one's relevant.
Anywho, I was on in transit to the interview with Danny Jones.
And I was traveling and I just hopped on to, you know how it is?
I just hopped on. I was late and I'm tired.
We were one of the last flights. Things were delayed.
So it was like, ooh, I was cranky. You know what I mean?
And I walked into this, walked into the little transit rail.
And there in these bright windows, bright lights, I started to put my bags down.
This little, you know, she must have been no more than 12.
Well-dressed girl was standing next to me and I pulled back
because I thought I was going to bumper or something.
I didn't see her when I walked in and I looked and there was nobody there.
I looked and there was nobody there.
Do you know how creepy, how wonderfully creepy it is to look into a reflection
and to see somebody who isn't there?
Let's keep going. Let's go. We got it.
We're in. They say we've got a connection.
Excellent. Excellent.
Gandhi. Oh, he's a warrior.
All right, let's go.
Give me the next one.
Quick. For the drugs, the filters wear off.
And look, what's happening?
What's happening, people?
