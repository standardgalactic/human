It's on a track for self obliteration.
Oh, yes, yes.
Because when you put everybody in a box and then kill everybody who's outside the box,
you're essentially killing yourself.
Yeah.
Oh God, it's gorgeous.
It's gorgeous.
Let's go to the next one.
Oh, look, Dionysus, can you tell us really quick?
How are we doing?
The people out there, can you tell us the people in the audience tonight?
Can you please tell us?
What does it say?
Do they attend a congregation?
Do they get it?
Do they get it?
Do they get it?
Great.
Lucifer.
Bringer of dawn.
Do they get it?
Tuna ya nebulo yo tas deprin frenas.
Wait, what?
Look at that last word.
Earlier.
Frenas from Fren again.
What are we talking about?
This frame thing for all the time.
That's what happens.
That's what Mother Greek allows you to do.
It allows you to look into a mirror at yourself.
The frame is you alive.
Yes.
Oh, isn't this nice?
What did he say?
Formerly.
That's okay.
Keep them up there.
Because I know what he says.
He says, formerly, your frame.
Yeah.
Your frame was what?
Oh my God.
Formerly, your frame was not kugyes.
It wasn't what?
It wasn't hygienic.
It wasn't healthy.
That's a medical term.
Your mind is off.
Formerly.
But now, he said, now that you're in my presence, you're starting to have what you need.
Okay.
I think we hit that final pitch.
I think we hit it.
Are we close?
I think so.
Chewie, let's blow this place.
Are you ready here?
Yeah.
That's the, that's the one I just read.
Give me the next one.
They want the drugs.
Okay, people.
Sit up for a minute, right?
Everybody, everybody sit up for a minute.
Here it is.
I've been talking about this.
People have been saying, oh God, how does he, how's he going to, he's just talking to
this crazy stuff about Christ as a drug.
Christ is a drug.
