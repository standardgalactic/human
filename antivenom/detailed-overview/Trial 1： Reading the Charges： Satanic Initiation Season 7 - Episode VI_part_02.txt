we did last night.
And is it connected?
And is it all part of the same venture?
Yes, it is.
It turns out we're talking about a section of known as
this paraphrase of John.
And he's saying that there are these two, Maria and Maria.
And one of them is the mother who produces the goddess, right?
And we talked a few episodes ago about it being feminine.
Why is Jesus the representative that's feminine and known as?
Well, you know, he's just trying to meet meter.
And it's just the wit and, well, that could be.
It could also be that they're associating this production
of a female goddess with Mary, the Virgin, right?
And there's Mary Magdalene here.
It says, right?
And Jesus, he's hanging on that cross.
And he's looking down at that kid that he loves,
that little kid who is the Theopida, right?
The Godchild.
Oh, look, there's the Godchild, right?
Right?
You're about to get some of that psychic battery, people.
Maitre Muthon, Alex.
Oh, goodness.
What's he say to her?
He says, hey, hey, lady, lady who loves virgins.
Next one, lady who loves virgins.
Look at your virgin son.
And then he says to his student, you know, his disciples.
He's a student, right?
A student.
Don't make it ugly.
It's the students.
He says, hey, you virgin.
And he uses a feminine there.
Because it says in a minute he's never
going to produce children, too, which is kind of weird.
But the thing I wanted you to pick up
was the very last line, the last two words.
This is a hapax legomenon.
Take that down.
What is a hapax legomenon?
It is word that only appears once.
This is the only place I have brought you tonight, a text
with the only time this word ever appears, ever appears.
Bring it up there.
Bring it up there.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.
So how do we define it?
Well, we work with its roots.
We break it down, right?
And it's someone who's not, literally, who's not experienced.
Ah, bad.
Not experienced in what?
Odinos.
And what are odinos?
What is an odinos?
It's a pain that you experience while you're giving birth.
Yeah.
And she didn't have it.
She didn't have it.
Isn't that interesting?
Who is the she?
Look at the very last word, people.
I'm telling you, this is right in the Greek.
Anasis.
Anasis.
Anasis.
That's wanasa.
Wanasa.
You say, why are you saying it with a W?
Philbert, you nerd.
Because it's a diagramma.
It's a diagramma.
And the diagramma is hiding in the Upsilon.
The diagramma is hiding in the Upsilon.
It's an old letter.
She is glorious.
The diagramma is glorious.
She stays as the number six.
She stays as the number six.
And the diagramma is hiding in that Upsilon.
She is the wanasa.
She is the queen.
You mean the virgin was a queen within the cult?
Yes.
She is the queen.
Do you know who Cleopatra was?
No, you don't.
You don't know Cleopatra?
You nerds don't know Cleopatra.
You think you do.
And you get all worked up about it.
And you say, oh, I've seen some sources.
And the sources say she was the most incredible.
Looking most intelligent.
Most kick-ass woman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what the sources say.
She was the manifestation in this dimension of Isis.
She was the vessel of Isis.
Oh, OK.
Let's take a look.
Let's take a look at her.
I'd follow her.
Right?
I love it.
Let's go to it.
Go to the source.
The next source, please.
Boom, I just want you to see.
I want you to look at something from antiquity.
What is a castus?
It's a stitched embroidered thing
that we say belongs to Aphrodite.
We'll call it a charmed girdle.
Just take it down for a second.
Can we relish for a moment?
I'm not in any hurry tonight.
And I don't have a whole, I'm going
to work slower on the text instead of cramming.
I didn't want to cram too much.
We're dealing, what are we dealing with?
We're dealing an instrument of Aphrodite,
an instrument called a castus.
Do you thank your seminarians know about this?
They didn't until I got to St. Mary's.
And then the enrollment went up.
It was fantastic.
What is this castus?
What is it?
What is it?
