It's an instrument of Aphrodite.
It's an embroidered skin made of skin, right?
With beautifully embroidered stitching,
illustrating some glorious, glorious things,
little wrapped in a, oh, such a soft, soft bed.
With a little embroidered story in it.
Oh, God.
And you know what's in the temple?
Wait, what?
Yeah, the sastis has a temple.
And what is the temple?
It's the place for the inner sanctum, right?
It's where you set up your tent.
It's where your skein-a is.
It's where your skein-a is.
It's a barb.
It's a barb.
Go back, go back, Chewie, to the next one.
Yeah, it's a barb.
Look, look, look, look.
Go down.
Yeah, look here.
What is this?
This is what you're doing.
This is the verb that they're taking it from.
Is the striking, the waspy, stinging.
It's a little stingy thing.
A cantron is a stinger.
It's a thorn.
Some people translate it as a thorn.
What is this thing that she's got?
She's got a thorn in the holy place of her girdle.
And that thorn is covered with purple.
And what happens when she takes that thing off?
You say, what?
Aphrodite's taking off her sastis?
Oh my god, this is the, this is it, right?
We're all looking at each other like, this is it.
This is it.
And she comes out and she strikes you with it.
And what happens when you get struck?
With Aphrodite's girdle.
You go insane.
You go mad with what they call erotomania, erotomania.
Love, love craziness, love craziness.
Yeah, it takes you there.
Isn't that nice?
She uses it.
Why does Aphrodite use this to influence you and me?
And you know the power of love, right?
I'm talking to the Saturnians here, right?
Not to the evangelicals or the Orthodox.
I'm not talking to you now because this is about gods.
And you don't worship gods.
You're the truest atheists on the planet.
So this really isn't for your ears.
But if you want to sit and be a voyeur, here it is.
And I know you do.
I know you do.
And I love it that you do.
I love it.
OK, so let's go back to the source and see.
Let's follow Aphrodite.
What are we doing?
I thought we were.
There's some felonious salt going on.
Hang on, hang on.
Next one, please.
Yeah, yeah.
What does it really mean to get struck with this thing?
It means to be net, oh, something.
To inire or co-irre with it, right?
Take it down.
They linked this process of this thorn that
is on this girdle.
They linked this process to the act of having intercourse.
So when someone comes along, I don't know,
someone like a John or a Paul, and they are talking about,
don't be involved.
Don't be involved in porneia.
They are not telling you not to have intercourse.
They're telling you not to be involved in the process of rebirth
through the classic Bacchic mystery.
This is the resurrection.
You don't want Osiris.
You don't want your eyes opened.
You don't want your eyes opened.
I can hear.
You don't want them opened.
Fantastic.
But for those who do, the call goes out.
The call goes out.
Bring us back up to see the last little bits of evidence
before we commence our trial.
Who is this Aphrodite?
I just want to introduce her to you.
She's a despoina.
And you say, what is a despoina?
Notice that they have despotes.
We get despot from that.
What is it?
This is a Bronze Age concept.
A mistress, lady of the house, right?
She used a Penelope.
Oh, that's nice, right?
Notice number two, princess or queen.
And then it says, well, what kind of queen?
The despoina colchon.
And who is that?
That's Medea.
They're quoting Pindar's Pythianode number four.
And Pindar's Pythian four is a record of Medea's oracle
that was handed down by the Delphic Pythia.
Yes.
Yes.
This is that old Bronze Age concept.
Go ahead and take it down.
Of that queen.
Of that queen.
Juan Asa.
We are talking about a woman of complete and total authority.
As a matter of fact, there's so much authority.
Get this.
If this is not, if this doesn't bring it out, nothing will.
This is not just a woman of authority.
This is a woman who will set straight
what has been made bent.
Wait, she will set you straight?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No.
It's everything.
Complete package of medical, psychic.
I mean, this stuff goes way beyond your average cure, right?
