The coyotes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hope you can hear that.
You hear them?
That's you.
That's you in the jury box.
Oh God, I love it.
Back to the sources.
Just a little bit.
I'm taking too much liberty.
I only have a couple more and I want to go through them.
Who are we talking about?
Did you tell who just entered the room?
Yeah.
Kronos did, right?
Who is Kronos?
He's Anculomatis.
Anculomatis.
What does that mean?
It means he's got a twisted mind.
He's got twisted thoughts.
He's got deceitful, twisted, calculated thoughts.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Are you ready for the castration?
Are you ready?
Hey, if you can't do it.
No.
No.
Kronos.
No.
Don't worry.
Don't worry for a second.
Did you realize that Helios was involved?
Yeah.
Let's see it.
Let's see the religion come out.
Keep going to the next one.
Yeah.
She's wearing this peplum.
I wanted to show you guys what she's wearing.
What is Aphrodite wearing?
This thing shines like glorious fire.
Like fire flaming up.
This is how her dress, isn't that nice?
Imagine it.
Can you imagine it?
Put that incredible, incredible goddess in a dress that looks like this.
Oh, wow.
The charm.
I'm already charmed.
You can hit me with that.
Cestus is all you want, but I'm already charmed.
Let's look.
It's beautiful, right?
It's gold.
It's beautiful.
It's gold.
And you ask yourself, my God, man, how many references to the gold?
Lady Babylon's got the gold.
Why the gold?
Because this, ladies and gentlemen, is the house of dawn.
And we are seated on the throne with dawn on one side and night on the other.
This is the house of the glorious son.
This is the house of Apollo.
This is the place where Satan, the bringer of light, Yosferos.
This is where he, and I'm not talking, I know, I know they want to say Satan doesn't exist.
And you see all the YouTube channels, Satan doesn't exist, it's this and that.
And those number heads will ultimately vomit out some garbage about air make.
And that's when you know, oh, God, hang on a second, hang on a second.
You're in the wrong camp.
You're in a propaganda stream, right?
Let me take you to the real stream.
We'll go back to the archaic Greek, where we'll find what these words are doing.
Oh, God, lace stays.
Let me show you what a lace stays is.
Oh, love it, love it, everybody, can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Yeah.
Don't ever mess with Yosferos, right?
Don't ever mess with the bringers of dawn.
The children of Rome, whose sacred name we don't know.
Yeah, one of us does.
One of us does.
I had somebody ask me, somebody that we all know asked me, can you tell me?
I said, no.
I've had other people ask me, can you tell me?
No.
Find the name.
Find the name.
These children of Venus is who the people of Rome are.
They are the children of Venus.
Okay.
Let's watch her.
Let's take a close look.
Bring up that last one.
We didn't quite finish it.
This thing is so beautifully worked, this dress that she's got.
It's so intricate, and it shines.
It causes this shining like the moon on her soft, delicate breasts.
It causes this shining.
It's a marvel to see.
Okay, take it down.
So you can see what the Greeks, in this archaic period, with things that they're really focusing
on, and what are the Adela, the images that they're using, and how those are affecting
their rights, and they're using her image, and that image is, you should understand that
there is a comfort in that image that is maternal.
The Romans found it.
They called her the Genetrix, which is like, it's almost like saying the great mother.
It's not the Magna Mater, but it's almost like saying the great mother.
It's the producer, the progenitor, she who brought us everything.
Remember, behind Rome is a she.
Behind Rome is a she.
This feminine force can't be overcome.
It can only be repressed temporarily.
Ultimately, it will bust forward.
It will burst out, ripe, and the world will be full of that bloom, that radiating bloom.
It's a feminine force.
It's a feminine force.
Bacchus always leads us to Aphrodite.
Okay, let's go to the next source.
Now, and I just want to say, if you can just look at this, she's always putting the gods
through it.
You know what I mean?
She's giving them that sweet desire.
Who here does not like to be compelled by the hormones?
I use hormones on purpose because it's within the structure of the Greek.
That desire, that pushes you, that pushes you, that force, that force that drives you.
It's so sweet.
It's so sweet.
And what does she do?
She blasts everyone with it.
The immortals, the mortals, the things that fill the air, and the wild things, those wild
