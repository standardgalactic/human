Look, filtra, filtra.
Oh, say it, right?
Tonight, we're loving these words.
We're making love to them.
I sent that to somebody.
I sent that to Hamilton's producer and said, hey,
we don't just quote sources.
We don't just give references.
We bring those sources out.
We make love to them.
Look at this, filtra.
Can you see this offering?
Oh, my God.
What is this thing?
We're going to find out.
She's got some on the inside.
Do you want some?
She's got some.
Where am I?
Just hang on.
It's ancient Greece, right?
Right all over the Mediterranean.
You can go anywhere.
Let's go to the next one.
Next one.
Oh, were you going to give that guy some time?
Who was it?
Who was it, Joey?
Bring it in.
Was it?
It wasn't.
Man of steel was it.
I hope not.
Seltaria.
Seltaria.
What is a Seltaria?
This comes from the very, very sexy.
Oh, delicious word root.
Thelg.
Thelg.
Do you want to get Thelg'd?
You know what I mean?
Who wants to get Thelg'd?
You know what?
You know what she does?
She gets Thelg'd.
And then everybody else around her,
they get Thelg'd.
Next thing you know, Orgia.
Yeah, love it.
Love it.
What is Thelg'd?
It comes from the word to be witch.
Wait a minute.
What does Victorians tell you?
Yeah, it comes from a word that means to take somebody
under your power using a drug.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
Yeah, Seltaria.
If you haven't been drugged by the ancient Amazonian queen,
how do you know?
Right?
She's got that big guy Heracles all tied up, bro.
I'm not talking myth.
I'm talking history.
Yeah, one year.
One year, man.
Well, that's the way it is.
Bronze Age power.
If you don't like it, nobody cares.
Oh, he was her slave.
You know what she'd made him do?
She made him wear a woman's negligee around.
I look nice.
I look nice.
Kind of liked it after a while.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Next one.
Joey, where places this?
This isn't like an asteroid belt or something.
I don't know what's going on.
She says, look, I've got a drug.
What is this man doing?
I've got a drug, right?
It's going to stop your disease.
What's your disease?
Oh, God, God, I got to tell you, this is Phaedra.
Oh, this is Phaedra.
Sex drug Phaedra.
She's got to stop talking to her.
Talk to them.
She's got a sexy, sexy, sexy step son.
Wait, what?
Yeah, no, he's like a, you know,
it wouldn't be legal in most states,
but it was legal then.
Yeah, under those circumstances.
So she had a thing for him.
She had a thing, what can you do?
Have you seen this guy?
Oh my God.
And so they're talking about getting some drugs, right?
And remedying the situation with drugs, right?
And she says, look, these things, these drugs,
now I'm translating, these drugs, don't worry.
They'll treat the disease, baby,
and they'll do it without shame,
and you won't burn your brain.
You won't slap your cerebrum.
That's what it says.
Why? Because, you know, that's how some drugs are.
Haven't you ever had your brain slapped?
That's what it says there.
Get your brain slapped.
You'll be ending up with thoughts that are places
that you, how do we get here?
Mm, I don't know, but I smell something delicious.
I do, I smell something delicious.
Oh, yes, you see it?
What is that stuff?
It's goop.
Let's go.
He's got the purple on board.
Thank you, Jesus.
We love you, Jesus.
Come back tonight.
Please keep coming back.
I sometimes I chase him away.
Sometimes he gets his groove on, you know what I mean?
Let's get to the next one.
This is historical Jesus we're talking about.
And so what does Phaedra say?
What does she say?
She says,
Potera de Criston e poton to farmacon.
She says, what is it?
Which kind is it?
Is it a Criston drug or is it a drinkable drug?
Is it a what drug?
Is it a Christing drug?
This is several hundred years before the Christ that you'd know came on the scene.
This, welcome, welcome, by the way, to everyone, free gifts tonight.
Now you.
Oh, we made it look at that.
