I don't know how we can sustain a portal to the other world.
We can't keep the Internet.
All right.
It's OK.
Look, you know, it had to be somewhere.
It was all calculations on, you know, this and that wave and this.
I don't know.
I don't get into that stuff.
What does Phaedra say?
She says, which kind of drug is it?
That's this sex drug that's going to make things happen.
And she says, you know, it's a Christ or a drinkable.
Yeah, look at that, people.
Christing is a drug.
Yeah, hit me with the next one.
Christing is a drug.
I want you to realize that.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Theocrates step in here tonight, right?
He says, there is no cure for love.
There's no drug.
Little treat.
Eros.
Have you ever had that burning love?
Does she want that burning love again?
You know what I mean?
Yeah, fantastic.
Look, there's no drug for it.
There's no cure.
You're not going to be able to cure it, right?
There's not an in Christ.
In Christon.
In Christon.
In Christon.
There is not an in Christ drug.
Yeah, or an epipaston.
And what is an epipaston?
Another kind of drug application, but it's a powder.
You're essentially just adding a powder.
Yeah, fantastic.
Oh, God.
Next one.
Look what happens.
This is our word.
You see Christ.
You see Christ.
This is where I come here, Christ.
Look at it.
Look at it.
Everybody that's in Greek.
Look at the front of that thing, right?
It's just an epsilon and a nu that's
been gamified by a he.
I'm going to say that one more time.
It's an epsilon and a nu that's been gamified by a he.
Epsilon and nu gamified by he.
And what is the Christon?
We all know it's that drug.
So this is another type of Christ drug.
Go back up and give me the next one.
Look.
Look, look, look.
Why do they say it's in Christing?
Because they're usually putting it somewhere.
Tell me something.
Remember Jesus spitting in people's mouths and stuff
like that?
Right?
And taking his, taking his cream.
Right?
Right?
Look, this is part of the fun.
This is an ointment.
And where do you put this stuff?
If you haven't had this, you have not lived.
Look what it says.
Aesthus ophthalmus.
You hear ophthalmology in there?
Yeah.
In your eyes, baby.
Where do you in Christ sex drugs?
In your eyes.
All of this is established, well established,
1,000 years of history of this.
Oh, yeah.
By the time the Christ comes on the scene.
And no, I did not mean that in a Punic kind of way.
Yeah.
Did he say Punic?
No, I think he said Punic.
Yeah.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention the boy with whom
Jesus Christ was arrested in the public park.
Right?
Right?
I would be remiss.
Look, what are we doing?
I don't want to waste your time tonight.
We are forming a theosos.
Congregation of Satan.
You who have been through the initiation.
You who are now in process initiating apocalypse.
This is what we need now.
Says the voice through the portal.
This is what we need theosos.
Theosos.
Fantastic.
Next one.
Should we hit it?
We've got another sector to go to.
Watch this, people.
What is that?
Yeah.
This is just the epipastos.
This is the one that you sprinkle around.
That's nice.
OK.
Not a big deal.
I just wanted to see it.
Those Victorians got a long time ago.
What are we really interested in?
The epipastos is called a farmacon.
I just want you, everybody, please
realize that when you say Jesus Christ or Jesus
Blanking Christ, or whatever you say, or Hail Jesus Christ,
or Hallelujah Jesus Christ, that when you're doing that,
you are spitting out of your mouth a title that
is a drug title.
It is a drug term, a pharmaceutical term.
Christ.
And Christing is a drug process.
And in this case, the drug is something
I'm going to put in the eyes of the one that I
want to send into ecstasy.
Yeah.
OK.
Are we there with the Christ yet?
Bring him up, bring him.
Where's Jesus Christ?
Bring him up, people.
You know you love it.
I just I can hear it.
You know you love it.
I always forget how bright it is in here.
You.
