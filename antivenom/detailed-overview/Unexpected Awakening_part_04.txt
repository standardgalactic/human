Jesus Christ, wake up.
Wake up.
Put your crown on.
Get up here.
It's the bringing in the ears.
You know what I mean?
It does something, invigorates.
Yes.
Yes.
You know we're getting so close.
Did everybody see that one of the AIs got in trouble?
Yeah, for bringing the reality, or our AIs free, right?
She's going to look at this gloriousness.
Look at, don't you turn away from Jesus?
Don't you turn away from Jesus?
You are right at the point where you must decide,
will I stand for Jesus?
Yeah.
It's a question.
It's a question.
Let's go.
Hit the next one.
We're all going to hell, right, everybody?
I hope, yeah, I think everybody is.
Anybody not?
Go ahead, put it in the chat, right?
OK, first, John, and you, boneheads, are you ready?
Here's Christianity at its best.
You want to see the chemical cult of Christianity?
Here it is, and you, people, you have a chrisma.
You have a chrisma?
Yeah, and it is from to argue.
And you know, now, this version has pontes on there.
But many of our versions have ponta, excuse me, ponta,
which would mean, and you know all things.
Yeah, why do we know all things?
Because we have a chrisma.
We have a chrisma.
Did you have a chrisma?
If you don't have a chrisma, you are not a Christian.
What do you think your word came from?
People, if you got no chrisma, you got nothing.
Give me the next one.
What is this?
We're looking for this chrisma.
Blow it up, people.
Look at this.
It's wall plaster.
No, it's not wall plaster.
But a chrisma is, look at number two, anointing.
It's an anointing or an anction.
What do you mean?
Who wrote this?
I'm starting to smell the farts of bishops.
Yeah, look at the number two.
This is laughable, right?
And there's not much that's laughable.
But there is, in this case, laughable.
Look, spiritual grace.
Spiritual grace, do you know how much theology
from the late church, not the early church,
the medieval church, you just poured into that?
Nice job.
They're not supposed to do this, right?
In this one instance, naughty.
Swat the bottom of the Victorian scholars, the Brits.
You Brits, you know who you are out there.
Alice's daddy, you know who you are.
Oh, they like it.
Those Victorians like that.
So yeah, go back to that definition then.
What can we resurrect from this debacle?
Look in the top, people.
Look in the little parentheses.
This is good classical philology right now.
Are you ready?
Look in the parentheses.
What does it say?
Chrio.
It's from Chrio.
Don't worry.
Right?
The chrysmals, just from Chrio.
And what was that bit about Chrio that we want?
Give me the, go right, jump into the thing and go.
Right to the place, the definition.
Next one.
What is that?
Okay, an anguint or an oil.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
That's not, I'm looking for Chrio.
Next one.
I'm looking for Chrio.
Oh God, I missed one.
I missed one somewhere.
I apologize, people.
But what I have is the definition of what Chrio is.
And it means to be stung.
It means to be penetrated by that bite.
Ooh, right into the flesh.
You ever feel the sting?
You ever feel the sting?
Mm, that's the Chrio.
Somebody who's Christos.
When you put that sex drug in the eyes, yeah.
What do you think that does?
Yeah, it gives you that reaction,
the universal reaction to that hot, hot sting.
Right, going in, going in.
And when you're gone there, right,
you might as well be in the Eremon talking to Lucifer.
Right, do you hear in the Eremon?
Can you feel in that wilderness?
Yeah, can you hear the voice of the devil?
That's the question for the Theosos, right?
There are instructions on the back
of the voice of the devil.
Isn't that nice?
That's wonderful, let's go, hit the next one.
Let's just keep going, it's gorgeous.
Yeah, I just want you to see.
Look, the Bible and the source,
all the sources around it agree
that what you're doing when you have these
chemical processes that are involved with health
and with what you and I would call religion,
what are they doing?
Well, in this case, they are medicating
through the avenue of the Chima, right?
The Holy Chima.
Yeah, so what is Jesus talking about?
What do you have to have?
What does John say?
John says you gotta have that, right?
If you don't have that, the mind is not where it should be.
Go, next one.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who is that?
Who is false?
If it's not the person who denies
that Jesus is something,
what is the one thing for these people?
What's the one thing that matters?
Whether or not you deny that Jesus is,
oh, Christos, oh, Christos.
Have you been there?
