That power
Do you understand? Do you understand?
If you're not praying, you're not bringing the power
Let's bring it
Chewie, give me that text
Oh god, we gotta spit
Look, these are the scholars
Now we're talking about Mike
And they're saying, look
There's types of drugs, right?
Look at that second line
People in the first word
Do you ever see Christ used?
Is this a drug? Well, here it is
Even the people making the notes
Were saying, look, these are
Types of drugs, you know
We Christ people
For the sake of therapy
For the sake of therapy
You've never cast out a demon before, have you?
Oh god
I get it
You know what I mean?
Kind of like that
And boom!
Next thing you know, somebody spit in your mouth
And put stuff in your eyes
I knew you'd love this party
Let's keep going
See what else these people do
It has not even started
The stuff that I'm about to tell you
Oh my god, it's gonna get us all kicked out of the galaxy
Watch this, okay
Bring that up, yeah
So some of these things, he says
We drink and we've got powders
And we've got Christ
And those Christs are medicines
That are being applied
Applied to the eyes
Ah, fantastic
Spit in my mouth
Yeah, it's the way the medicine works
If you have a problem
With your physician drinking your urine
In your mouth
It probably antiquities not the place for you
Now let's go to the next text
Boom
Oh look, another note
I just wanted you to see another note
Look at the very bottom line
And everybody
When I talk about
Christ as the
Pharmaceutical operation
People looking at me and they scratch their head
Okay
This is for that
Annoying, this is for that
Annoying person
You know who you are
You know who you are
Here it is
Check it out, you
Stop, you gotta stop me when I
You gotta stop me when I go there
I had flashes, visions of
Things that
Rime with Gamora
Let's go
Look what's going on here
Christ Pharmaceuticals
Yeah, yeah
Get Christ the baby
Next one
Boom
Look what we've got here
Now this is a giant text, I am not
Going to stand here and translate this
I'm gonna break it down
A little bit and I just want it to roll
I just want it to roll
I want you to sit there
I want you to sit there in your chairs
You sit there in your car
Maybe you propped up on your
Bed
Maybe you're sitting there in the jacuzzi
That's nice if you go to jacuzzi
Sit there and I just want you to soak up
The scene
Of what's going on
The scene because we're going to
Infiltrate the Christians
We're going to watch what they do
Are you ready
This
Is forbidden Christianity
Yeah, oh god
Look at them, they're getting here
Okay, go through here
Hurry before they get distracted
Before they get distracted
I'm going to begin this off for you
It was night time
About the time that the people
Light the torches, blow it up
And you know
It's about the time that we go out
And sing
The satiric passion
Is about that time
So what do they do
What do they do
You can tell me what they're doing
Oh
So they gather together
All the girls
Who have been trained
For these specific purposes
And they
Put them together
Inside
Of pre-selected chamber
Fantastic
Get them a
Room
Get them a room for the
Evening
What do these girls do there
The first thing is
They put out the lights
Go ahead, give me the next one
First thing is
They put out the lights
Right
It's dark
Why do they put out the lights
You might ask, well what does he say here
So
That they have
No light of
Witness
Of their dirty
Dirty acts
Remember
