Oh god, you pour
this stuff out and you know what happens
when they bring this stuff? You
can see the entire
troop of demons
Oh god
You interrupt, has something to do
with your brain, interrupt your brain
All of a sudden you're seeing quantum stuff
Oh my god, next thing you know
you're wandering around
tempted by the devil
longest
longest on record
Oh, love it, let's go
Where is Jesus
tonight by the way?
Are we finding the Christ?
Let's find him
What do they make with it?
Look at the third line down
The third line
Delugma sundit easin
Wait, they what?
They synthesize
literally or compound
The delugma
The what?
The delugma
It's the synthetic delugma
Wait a minute
Isn't this the
thing that Chewie
Wait, we've seen this before
What is this
abomination
that we're talking about
Give me the next one
Look people
Here's the quote
Where is it?
Right up you
Here we go
All right, Kai Hegune
There was this woman right and she's
closing the stuff and whoop whoop whoop
What happens?
Second line near the end line
She's got a golden
cup in her hand
And what is she doing?
What's in that golden cup?
The same thing you and I just saw
Delugma
It is her
abomination
Ladies, did you know that you could
produce an abomination?
Yes, you can
You can, it's a part
of your witchy creative activity
But it's this witchy creative activity
This witchy genius
That has given us the Christ
So we owe them, don't we
Who are you talking we?
We owe them, don't we?
We've got to give them the truth
You people develop this
And now they've got to know it
Christ is from this
Now we know
Ever since Jesus
got brought up on charges
You know
Declared guilty
It's okay, talking about Jesus's
naked boy that he was arrested
with in a public park at 4 a.m.
That's all okay
And by the way
I will be talking
In a couple of interviews
coming up
Trying to keep these people
From putting them behind
Some kind of paywall
Because the devil was like
And I was like, what?
Who said that? Which one of these
demons
Excuse me
There he is
One of them
Gave you a bad story
Because I don't do any hookery
I don't
Refuse it
No hookery
That's what happens
When you give in
And you compromise
You know what side can be turned over
You know what's going to be
Exposed, don't you?
Greed, man
Greed is a terrible thing
No hookery, please
For anyone
Yeah
Let's go back to
The Lady Babylon
There we go
She's got that golden cop
With that real genuine formula
With that
Pollution
That can
Reverse aging
You know
That can prevent growths
You know
Stabilism
Isn't that weird? You're programming
People biologically
It's this type of medicine
We lost it
We lost it
Yes
It could be taken back
It could
But then where are we going to find all the babies?
Right? Oh god
Don't you love this? You evangelicals out there
If you don't hear this
And know that this is the end
You know, right now
You should go up to your
If you're an evangelical
Walk up to your rooftop
Yeah
Go out to your roof
Stand there and look up
Because Jesus
Is on his way
He is on his way
And he's going to be bringing with him
A naked kid
Hit us with the last
