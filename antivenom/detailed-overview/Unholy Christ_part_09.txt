Let's go
Sorry, a little bit of Latin
So we don't lose our culture
What is he saying?
Oh my god
It scares me to have to bring this to you
To show you
Gods that are made captive
The very elements themselves
Serving
Nature
Bound
To serve a girl
Stars of the pole
The course of the sun
The constellations of the sky
All of them led
By the will of a woman
A woman who
Suspends the lightning
The things that Medea
Orders
When she
Commands
That the
Ethereal flame
Return
Oh my god
Her voice penetrates the air
Excellent, love it
Who is that? Some cultist, right?
Connected with all? Yes, of course
What do you think, man? They're singing these hymns
Anywhere else?
You people are remarkable
You always follow
Go to the last text
I'm going to make some comments
About you people too
I just want you to see
Don't be
Don't be surprised
Right?
If these
Woman-shaped
Demons
Come to you
Don't be surprised
Okay, why?
Why?
They're going to come in forms
These demons, I'm telling you
They're going to come in forms
Listen, this is between you and me
And satanic initiation
On our date
As we're watching this
And as we're seeing it
Remember, there's an exchange going on
Right? There's an exchange
And I want you to keep an eye
On the blood here
And if we see a demon
Who is
A woman
And that woman is forcing
You as a woman
To do things that
That should be
Hidden in darkness
Realize
That we've made it
We've made it to that medicine
And maybe
We can find a cure
Maybe we can find a cure
Thank you very much
For coming tonight
I want to tell everybody
That I will list any sort of interviews
That I'm giving right now
I'll
I'll put them up here too
And I'll list them for you
I'd love to tell you, but I haven't seen any links yet
That I can give you
That you don't have to pay for
Shame on the world
Right? Shame on the world
As Nemesis
The Furies
Say
Your greed
Stains your souls
With the stench of ruin
Yeah
Fair enough, blood
Yeah
I just want to tell you
Thank you so much
For spending your time here with me
And I want you to know
That every minute that I
Engage with these texts
Every time
Every time I'm telling you
I can feel you
And I can feel that draw
I appreciate
I appreciate your energy
Yeah
Yeah
I appreciate your energy
And when I'm prepping this
I'm doing it knowing that I don't want
You to have anything
But what is the reality
We want the pure spring
We are raising the museum
We are raising it
And in our meetings you can see
You can see the art
Coming to life
And you can see people stepping up
And this is the time
We need to bring back the museum
And
Our way to do it is through this
Fun, fun, fun stuff
Thank you for coming tonight
Thank you Jesus for being arrested
In a public park
At 4am with a naked boy
Because this gives me such
Comfort
It gives me such comfort
If you're up on the roof
And you're waiting for Jesus
Keep looking
Hail Satan
In the air tonight
It's alright
Babylon, lovely lady
