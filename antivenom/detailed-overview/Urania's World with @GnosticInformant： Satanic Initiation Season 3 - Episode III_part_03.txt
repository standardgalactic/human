Right.
Except switch because he would have to be stealing it from her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're dressing up Jesus as she, because Jesus is borrowing from this tradition.
He is operating the mystery, but he's doing it himself.
Not through her.
Right.
Do you understand?
Of course.
That's why he's arrested with a naked boy.
Right.
Of course.
That's why there's stuff on his face.
Right.
There always is in the right.
Okay.
Look at, uh, we got that, uh, that third to last line.
All things.
Right.
Are made.

Right.
You are that telos of the mystery.
You are that completion.
Go to the Colossians texts.
Please.
Where's the apostle Paul here?
Come here.
Come here.
You bitter.
Oh, no, it's not that one.

I was in the spirit.
Are you in the spirit?

You know, they got some kind of animal horn and a bird.
You see them out protesting in front of Trump too.
Right.
It's a thing.
It's a symbol.
It's that trumpet.
They, they want that.
They're Jericho followers.
And then you know who I'm talking about.
They walk around Jericho and blow the horn and bring down the bad guys.
Right.
And they often confuse that with this.
And that is not what this is.
The corruption is the Hebrew side of it.
It comes through that through the horn.
It's not what this is.
This is a Truscan.
This is a Truscan that thing that they carry around.
It's actually a trumpet.
They can smack you with it too.
