She is gorgeous. She's the treptera. The treptera of everyone. Yes. Treptera. Please,
Chewie, bring us up the next one to show us. What's a treptera? A treptera is a feeder?
A feeder. It comes from the root for nourish. It comes from the root for nourish. We're already
going to feed. We're already going to nourish because we're the old mother. You mean this is the
dayo behind Jova? Jovayahu? Yes. Yes. This is what Jovayahu was trying to do.
You're with me in the right. Let's see what she's like. Shall we see what she's like? You want
to see her? You want to see her? I'm bringing her. Jesus. Come on. Let's do it. Let's do it. Next one.
Tell me, Jesus, what kind of qualification? Peter. Peter sitting here. Look at this, people.
Let me set the scene for you. Jesus and Peter. Remember, he's one of the 12 boys that Jesus
kind of secrets away from the parents and is like, oh, you know, here we go. Lay stays. Look at
this. Are you ready? He says to him a third time. Yeah. Simon, son of John. Do you love me?
Filesme? They chose. They chose one with a little bit of creep in it. Take it down.
A little bit of creep. Now, C.S. Lewis. Oh, I am so glad. I've been waiting for this one for a long
time. C.S. Lewis, who out there? Who out there is a fan of C.S. Lewis? Because you need to come to the
front. You need to come to the front and see this. C.S. Lewis, I hear you wrote. I hear you wrote a
book about the four loves. A book called The Four Loves or Some Such Nonsense. Tell me, did you try
to change what was in the text? Oh, God. If you have read C.S. Lewis's Four Loves in Greek, he's
talking about the Greek words for love and he so messes it up. He bends it and contorts it to fit
within a scheme that you who are sucking the fumes of the fairy tale can digest.
C.S. Lewis. Do you know where C.S. Lewis is? C.S. Lewis is in the bowels of a whale that lives in
the abyss. He is continuously excreted as fecal matter into the darkness and then
re-consumed to be digested and excreted again. This is C.S. Lewis. You want your seat with him?
You want your seat with him? I'll show you. Love it. Love it. Let's go. Next one. Jesus.
Strip down. Okay. Are you guys ready? We're going to see Jesus strip, totally strip.
He says to Simon, do you love me? He picked the one, Philaeus. He picked the one that's heavy,
heavy, heavy, affection in a sexual way. It's really weird. It's really weird. He could have picked
any of the others and it wouldn't have been quite as damaging as this. I mean, we talk about kisses
on this. Do you give kisses? I give kisses. Do you give kisses intense? Right? I give kisses
intense. This is the love that Jesus is using. You love me, buddy? You love me, my little guy?
And Peter, what happens? He says, Peter gets mad. Peter gets mad because he's hurt. He's hurt.
He's elpated and he's hurt and he says, listen, listen. All right? Do you love me?
Peter's pissed and he says, you, you know, you darn well know it. You perceive it with your
noggin, Jesus, that I feel owe you. And what does Jesus say? What does Jesus say at this critical
moment? He says exactly, exactly what the dameter must say. He says, Bosque, feed him. Feed my little
sheepies. Feed my little sheepies. Look at the word probatiamu. Feed my little sheepkins.
You're in charge. Go out of the next one. Do you know what she is? She is spermia.
She is spermia. Do you see the word sperm? You should. You should. That's a biological term,
by the way, people. You talk about spermicides, for example, prophylactics that are physical barriers
to the sperm. Right? Right? She is the spermia. Wait a minute. Did you say that right? Yeah, wait,
wait, is he should have been, no, it's she. She is spermia. How do you translate that?
How do you translate that? She's the wand of the seed. Did you know there was such thing as female
seed? Did you know? Did you know? How'd you think we'd get bred? How'd you think we'd get bred?
Oh, wow. It's through the dameter. Yes. Yes. Now, hang on. Hang on. The skirt is only so high,
and we're pushing it up. We're pushing up the historical skirt of Jesus Christ. Okay. Are you
ready? Let's keep, let's go back to the next one. Hit it. Okay. Now, look, everybody, while you're
standing here, I want to take us from this entryway to the party, and I want to go straight in. I want
to head to the temple. Everybody, up the hill, let's go to the temple, and you're going to hear
something. You're going to hear something from this ghost that I found as we walk along the way. His
name is Seirach. Seirach. Put it out. Put it out, you bonehead. Do you know what this guy did? Take
it down. Take it down. This is, this is in your Bible. It's in your Bible. Yeah. And there's,
it's, you know, the Greeks and Romans, this said the stuff about the Septuagint, this fairy tale,
about it being, because they were sticklers, right? They were sticklers. They'd been quoting
primary sources for years. They knew how this thing, this museum thing worked. So they're saying,
look, this idea that the Septuagint is a translation, that's BS. You know, your letter of
Aristate, that stuff is not legit. And everybody knows it's not legit. Well, we have one of those
people who was trying to appropriate to create Judaism, right? Because Judaism had lost its
language, right? It had been flooded with the Greek. So in an attempt, they used the Greek to try
to re, to try to recreate a past that you can accept that will justify what we do as a group.
Fantastic. Fantastic. And what did they do? This one named Seraph, he came in, he, he wrote this,
this introduction to a work where he says, he's like, Oh, I know, I know, it's so hard to convey
in the translation, these words, he's got no text, he's got nothing. He's got nothing. And he writes
this phony, you can read something, I encourage you all, all of you must learn Seraph, first,
first, just open it up to the beginning when he's apologizing. And you'll see somebody who is
attempting to appropriate the Romans and Greeks caught it, right? They caught it. They're at,
they're at 500,000, baby. The Greeks are at 500,000. The Hebrew language, it's at six, seven,
thousand, maybe eight. I've seen some people estimate 9000 unique words. Do you think they're
going to have half of this technical terminology? No, they don't. They don't. But they have to
