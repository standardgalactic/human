This is what I'm saying.
You don't know the difference
between Dan and me.
You don't know the difference.
He says, it's this way.
I'm saying, it's this way.
Who can tell?
Who can tell?
Well, we know your reason.
We know your...
Oh, did somebody want me to spank?
Now I'm a slave.
I'm a slave to you, Satanist.
Oh, I love this.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
You know, here.
Let's just pull down, Dan.
Just pull him down.
Just a little bit.
Just a little dip, Dan.
Oh, it's okay.
See how flinchy.
Finchiness.
Let's go.
Oh, God.
You got the bucket thing going on
right from the beginning.
Okay, so before we put that up,
now here, I'm just gonna drop the bomb
at the beginning of this whole thing.
And you can just listen to this,
tune out and walk away
and still receive the same level of satisfaction.
Right?
This is finishing during dessert.
Ever finished during dessert?
Oh, God.
This is it.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
What is the problem, Dan?
The problem is you're not looking at the sources, right?
You're not looking at ancient medical sources.
You're not looking at any of the contemporary lit.
I know you're not.
Because I can tell.
I can track you from the way that you handle Greek.
I can track you.
Ready?
Are you ready, Dan?
Okay, pull it up.
Give Dan it.
We'll give Dan the pharmacone.
Are we gonna give Dan the pharmacone?
Here you go.
Here it comes.
It's a drug, Dan.
Look at the top.
It's a drug.
Whether healing or noxious.
So who do they give us?
Now, what are you guys looking at here, by the way?
This lexicon?
I saw you use the lexicon, Dan.
It was like watching a person pick up a hammer
for the first time or something.
Yeah, the authoritative.
You know, this is not the authoritative text.
This is a tool that the Victorians developed.
Those great classical pharmacologists from 1850.
Right?
This is them.
This is Alice in Wonderland, baby.
So you got to respect it.
And how do you use this tool?
You got to walk through the sources.
If you're walking the word through the sources,
you can see how it is used over time.
And you can trace its semantic drift.
You can see what happens to it.
Oh, it's a history.
It's a history and it's so vibrant.
Watch the drugs here, people.
Are you ready?
Here comes the bomb.
Look at paragraph number two.
Healing remedy or medicine, right?
In Homer.
In Homer.
Give me the next slide.
Is this that blown up?
Watch this, people.
Boom.
Are you ready?
Mostly applied outwardly.
And then he gives a whole bunch.
Look at this gorgeous Greek here.
Oh my God.
Epithese famachakken.
Oh God.
Look.
Oh, it just, I don't know.
There's, you know, there's a charm.
There's a charm.
There's a charm.
You know, somebody's out there right now making video.
Video about something, I don't know.
Something I said, I don't know.
It's probably not relevant.
But they're making it.
And it just makes me wonder, how do you justify?
If the language that you write in, ancient Hebrew,
it's got 8,000 unique words, 8,000.
How do you compete against Greek?
It's got somewhere between 500,001 million to 1.5 million
they've estimated.
You know, you can't count that kind of thing.
You can't count that thing.
Your vocabulary, that's reaching for the stars, baby.
That's reaching for the stars.
That's why, do you see how amazingly superior ancient Greek
is to the Anglo-Saxon garbage that we have to deal with
that our brain is stuck in?
Do you see it?
I can't get 1.5 million words.
I can't even comprehend.
How do you get that much?
What kind of concepts explode in your brain?
Oh, I love it.
I love it.
Let's relish this.
He's still here, Dan.
Get over here.
Bring that second one up again.
Okay, Dan, are you ready?
Dan, pay attention and look, Dan.
Look what kind of drugs we're talking about in this one.
Oh, look to the end of the one, two, three, four,
fifth line down.
Are you gonna see, Dan?
Pharmacon Christon.
Oh my God.
Christon Pharmacon.
What is it?
What is a drug Christ?
What is a drug Christ?
We've got that passage.
We'll show it to you before we do.
Before, well, that's Euripides.
Oh, right.
And Dan says, now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, if Euripides used it,
it cannot be used by a Christian the same way
because there is a wall of separation.
Only in your false reality, Dan,
does something like that exist.
Think about this, Dan, for a minute.
Think about it.
Think about it.
Classists sit around and they study all the texts
and they study how the texts influence each other.
Do you know of all the thousands of authors
that we have, Dan?
Of all the thousands of texts that we've got, Dan?
Do you know how many of those are walled off
and considered, oh, maybe out of time and space?
Are they in a different dimension?
You're in a fairytale world, Dan.
Look, Dan, look at Jesus Christ, Dan.
Look at him on that next line down, Ang Christon.
Look at the word following, epichriston.
Do you know what the difference is, Dan?
You would, if you read the medical texts,
but Dan doesn't read medical texts.
Dan says he knows Greek, but he does not know Greek.
And you're sitting there in the audience
and you don't know.
Dan can put on a face and can sit there
and project to you confidence.
And a guy like me can hear him
and now he's full of it, right?
Now he's full of it, right?
Preposterous, preposterous.
How many academics conferences
did I go to where they use preposterous?
Right?
That's the disease of theology.
That's the academic disease of theology.
It really just takes up all the space in the student's brain
and they can't grow with the Greek.
Oh, God, I love it.
Is this getting hot?
Is this getting hot?
I'm starting to get like, oh, Dan,
just hang in there with me, Dan.
You'd love it, you know what I mean?
You'd learn to love it.
Let's go to that very same source.
I just want to make sure that we gleaned everything.
Oh, look, he's got at the bottom.
For those who were curious,
at the bottom he's got the different types of drugs
in Greek.
You got catapulton, you got porton,
you got epipaston, those things you sprinkle on, right?
You got epichriston as opposed to the enchriston.
These epichriston, you're going into the surface,
like with your thumb and somebody's eye, right?
Enchriston is an incri-station.
It's going beneath the surface.
There's a, it's a more aggressive form
of the application of the drug.
How, you know, we can do a lot with whips and,
you know, stuff like that.
But this is Bacchic, baby.
This is Jesus in his earliest form, right?
Go hit the next one.
Chewie, look at this people.
Now, remember what Dan said, right?
There's absolutely, this is just absolutely crazy.
There is no connection between Christ and drugs.
That's because Dan has never read the text.
Dan, I'm so sorry.
Those, those degrees, those degrees, right?
Ah, ah, it's a Bible Institute.
Ah, ah, okay.
Look at this, look at the epichristos.
I love this.
Smeared on, right?
Painted, right?
Give me the next one.
There's a companion flower there.
I love that.
They don't need to see that one.
And here's the enchristos.
I just want you to see it, people.
Look, here is the word Christ.
Danny Jones, please look at this word.
You can see it in the Greek and it says,
in Christ's station.
And it's something that you rub into somebody.
And where do you rub it?
Look at the Greek in the blue.
It's in the blue.
Aestos of Thalmus.
Oh, isn't it?
Greek is so sexy.
Ancient Greek.
Well, Greek is not ancient Greek.
Greek, ancient Greek.
So it's got this kind of boom, boom, boom.
You know what I mean?
You're at that, you're at that,
what are they called?
Wraves or whatever.
What is the Aestos of Thalmus?
Into the eyes.
Into the eyes.
Dan, I know you didn't read any of these texts, Dan.
You can take it, Dan.
I know you didn't read any of these texts, Dan,
that I'm showing you references to.
I know you haven't, Dan.
And I know you haven't read authors
that are contemporary with the New Testament.
People like Diascortes, Dan.
Do you know that Diascortes talks about Christ, Dan?
Does you know what he does?
Of course, he's talking about Christing
because it is a pharmaceutical operation.
The first Christ, Dan, was a woman
and she is the genius who figured out the mystery.
Oh God, Dan, does that hurt you?
Does that hurt you, Dan?
Oh, let's see it.
They don't trust me.
They don't trust me.
I want to say something, a couple of things,
a couple more things as we kind of,
as we kind of establish the Christ, right?
What is the Christ?
You have to also realize,
please realize everybody out there.
And I'm giving you this because a lot of people here
have given their time for this.
So I want to honor you.
Are you ready?
That first Christ is a woman
and she Christ herself in order to enter
into a state of mania and then proceeds
to intoxicate people around her
to force them to enter that state's active,
active possession, active possession, fantastic.
Okay, let me get to the next one.
I want to give them the right hook here.
Here comes the right hook, Dan, please.
Hang in there, Dan.
I know it looks bad and I know I just showed you
reference to a text that talks directly
about putting those in the eyes.
But you know, Dan,
there's a guy diascortes in the first century.
He's got it all there, Dan.
You can find that.
Sometimes you want, you can go to Lady Babylon.
