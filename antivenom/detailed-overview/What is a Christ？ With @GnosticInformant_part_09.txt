People are talking about pray for Dan,
and that group is assembling.
What do you think about that?
Wait, what?
Say pray for Dan.
Yeah, pray for Dan.
Do you have anything in the comments to say pray for Dan?
No, I wasn't looking at the comments, but...
There's...
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
No, pray for Danny.
Pray for Danny, right?
Pray for Danny Jones, because he's interacting
with demonic forces of the devil.
Oh my God, it's so...
Danny, my interview with Danny is coming out next week, so...
Oh...
By the way, for the 561 people who are watching,
who are new, or a lot of them are new,
because it jumped up about 300 since the last...
Since before the Danny interview,
which by the way, congrats on you because...
And for really doing good in that interview.
Anyways, Danny talked for the first...
We talked for three and a half hours.
The first whole hour was just about what you said.
It was me responding to your interview,
without even seeing it, just kind of feeling out
what Danny was telling me that you were talking about.
So it is kind of a part two, in a way.
It is kind of a part two to yours.
Good, good, good.
I mean, it sounds like it'll be a nice bridge.
That's gorgeous, and you know what that is?
Look what's going on, man.
That's collegial advancement in science, baby.
That's what you're doing.
You're talking about text, and you're talking about...
Look at text, and then translate.
Speaking of text, one more text before we go.
One more text before we go.
I got it on the bottom.
Remember, remember we were talking about
the idea of the whole...
The Mark 14 theory that you...
Or the Mark 14 reading, as you would call it,
actually has some evidence behind it.
The PGM is a temporary text with the Gospels,
and it tells you to...
To Helios wrap a naked...
and linen a scene done, right?
From head to toe.
Hands, ringing your noise.
And it says...
It says...
What is the words that Jesus says on the cross?
So, there is an argument...
It's a solid, slam-good argument, I think, to be made.
That these could be some sort of...
This could be some sort of magical text going on.
I'm just saying.
I just opened up a whole new can of words right there.
No, no, no. You know, Neil,
I've got a whole book of Christian...
Early Christian magic somewhere.
And those texts.
I think a lot of them are Coptic.
But, yeah, no, seeing the use of the magic,
there are a lot of naked boys that you're going to find
running around in...
There's a lot of weird shit like that in the PGM.
Magical text.
I found 20 like that.
There's like 20 of them like that.
I'm so glad that you brought me those naked boys tonight.
I appreciate it.
Anyone know where I can see a copy
of the performance of Matthias?
They got him excommunicated.
Now, technically, who is that, Milo?
Milo, let me tell you this.
I wasn't excommunicated because in order to be excommunicated,
you got to be communicated.
And I was not communicated.
So, they couldn't excommunicate me.
They could just fire me.
And that's what happened.
By the way, that performance of Matthias...
Oh, it's absolutely delicious to have it.
I just want to...
I'm glad you brought it up because I just want to say this.
Imagine, just imagine this from it,
a chorus of Catholic college girls
dressed in leather with dildos pointed at priests
who had been accused of being pedophiles.
Oh, my God.
That was the sexiest...
The Monsignor told me.
No, no, no.
I want to tell people what the effect of that was,
historically, because I want this done.
Somebody writes this down.
The effect of those performances, right?
So, we're giving these performances during the school year, right?
And for the theater department.
And it's a big project.
And it's just gloriously done.
Very professionally handled, outstanding work, right?
All around.
Costumes are...
Oh, God, they're gorgeous.
And so, in the midst of all of this,
in the midst of all of this, there's a chemistry
that's going on between the stage
and the audience that's perceiving the play.
And that chemistry could be felt in the seminary.
The seminary servers skyrocketed with porn.
With porn, the furies, those Catholic girls
brought out the fury.
And all the servers, porn,
warnings, boo, hey, hey, right?
Because they monitor all that stuff, right?
When was this?
This was when I was at St. Mary's.
And one of my students was the Monsignor,
who was in charge...
This is a college, though, right?
Yeah, St. Mary's University, right?
In Minnesota.
And the person that was one of my students
was also the Monsignor, who was involved in...
You know, overseeing when bad things happened,
you know, and making them right.
Or at least, you know, making sure
that the train got going somewhere to Wrightville, right?
He was a former Navy guy.
You know, I absolutely loved him.
I absolutely loved him to death.
Great guy.
And, you know what, he would have been...
If he didn't become a vicar general,
he would have ultimately, in another life,
he would have been in the museum.
And he would be standing next to the poets, Neil.
You know what I mean?
So, anywho, that was totally unrelated.
But I want people to enjoy all the demon possession stuff.
All of these...
These emails are fantastic.
The people, look, I'm a real priest,
and this guy's really possessed.
Or look, I'm a shaman.
I like that Iowa Scarow wrote,
and he's like, this guy is totally possessed, right?
So, yeah, we're gonna get the Greek...
Plato said being possessed is the highest form
of a state you can be in.
That Bacchic mania, baby.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
It's gonna be...
You know, the other day, Neil...
That's the Holy Spirit.
When you see...
By the way, this just blows my mind.
And you know who wrote a lot about this?
It was Carl Kereny, an early religion scholar
from the 1900s to 1940s,
I think somewhere in between there.
Early to middle...
First half of the 20th century, let's just say that.
And he was friends with Carl Jung.
They co-wrote books together.
Actually, I have it right here.
This book right here is co-written by Carl Jung
and Carl Kereny.
Essays on a Science of Mythology.
And they talk about, look,
when you see these snake-handling Christians
speaking in tongues,
and going shaking because they have the Holy Spirit,
that's Bacchic mania.
They're adopting that from the Greeks.
This is an ancient idea from the mystery religions
that's being passed down all the way until today.
Totally, totally, totally.
And you know, the Christian community
is going to have to face this more and more
as the knowledge spreads.
They're going to see their own origins.
And they're not going to like what they see
in the naked boy.
The naked boy is just that cherry on the top
of the cupcake of doom.
So let me finish with that
and tell people, Chewie wanted me to let you know
that we've got things.
They're going to start getting rolling
with Amenu, a place where people can come
and can learn and can be enlisting
in basically taking a lot of ancient Greek dope
and growing your brain in a warrior's way.
And let me tell you something.
I have so many students,
so many students who entered into the same initiation I did.
The ancient Greek gets into your brain
and it starts changing it.
And it gives you vision.
It gives you vision in a way that you can't do
with the Anglo-Saxon.
I don't know, not all of us are created equal
in the world of language.
Life's rough.
It's survival of the fittest.
And Greek made it to the top
and then squashed everybody else around
or just, oh, God, Athena, you're so sexy.
By the way, I remember Carl Sagan.
Rest in peace, Carl Sagan.
He's the one who stuck his neck out,
great scientists of our time.
He stuck his neck out and said
that Dark Ages was a real legitimate term
and I'm standing by it and he got in trouble for that.
I even heard a scholar say he did damage for saying that.
On his show, on his show,
look it up, it's on YouTube, the episode one of Cosmos.
From a show from the 1990s or 1980s or something.
Old show, it's called Cosmos
and he opens up the show brilliantly
talking about Eratosthenes and Plato
and Aristotle and Archimedes
and all these amazing writers
from mathematicians and scientists
figuring out the movements of the stars
and all this shit and the death of Hypatia
and the Alexandrian Library
and then he uses the term Dark Ages that followed it
and they were like, he did damage for saying that.
That was mean.
You shouldn't have said that.
That's not a legitimate term to use anymore.
Nope, I agree with Carl Sagan.
I got Carl Sagan's back and I'm going to stick with it.
Look at what have you become.
You have become some kind of renaissance.
I'm expecting you to write out soon with like armor or something.
I'm going to be like, oh god.
Seriously, seriously, I am so impressed
and I'm a little bit set back.
Let's end on this.
I'm a little bit humbled tonight
because Neil, I got to confess to you.
I don't do some of those sources like you do.
Like Machiavelli, I was like, oh shit.
You know, hey.
You know what?
You know what this is?
This course is on Livy.
It's amazing.
Okay.
You know what?
Everyone talk about the prince?
Boring.
This course is on Livy.
That's an amazing text.
I will do.
I will do it and look people what's happening.
Look what's happening.
This is a dojo.
This is a place.
This is a renaissance dojo.
And that's what I really, really wanted
with Lady Babylon.
Everybody who's new, thank you for coming.
You're all sexy.
