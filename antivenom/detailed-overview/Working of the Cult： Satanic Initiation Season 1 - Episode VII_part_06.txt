the medic poma the medic thing that we um is our communion is our communion um yeah and then we get to
the birth ending off with the oistress right they call beautiful they call beautiful why because
they're using the oistress in the in the birthing process it's an eos it's a it's a poison that um
numbs pain and facilitates birth and that's why you get kicked out of the garden you
you disgusting women that i'm speaking like joeba right that's why you have to leave the garden
it wasn't because um um it wasn't because uh you would uh you know you wouldn't be able to find a
better place condo somewhere maybe well a piece of strip land it wasn't because of that it was
because you would lose access to the drug that allowed you to enter into that painless state of
birth um which people say is that natural is that natural yeah because what was there was from what
was in the garden those were the drugs that she was using in order to do that um you know this is
fantastic i want to i want to transition and talk to um darin here for just a second um about
he said something earlier today hey darin it's good to see you um you said something earlier today
and i know this is not your expertise but you're just reaching out there and you're getting
information you know we're looking for civians um in armor you know what i mean we're uh we're
looking for some kind of warrior not necessarily heavy armor but something you'd wear on a horse
you know and you could be comfortable in while you're collecting your herbs and i'm looking for a
six foot i'm looking for a 12 year old six foot 12 ish 13 somewhere in the chorus stage um yeah and
i hear that they these may be out there um you feel pretty good about that um yeah i feel pretty
good about that so um there's a couple articles i'll post them in discord again but i already posted
them but they found in northern or well northern mongolia southern russia tuva region they found
remains of a civian woman 13 years old decked out in amazonian gear and very large so i think
you know we have our evidence there fantastic fantastic now you you have been uh working
on the discord a lot and so you're feeling a lot of questions and you've given me several
topics to talk about is there anything in general that people seem to be really interested in that
i may be able to address no promises but maybe so right now two of the big fields that are really
interesting is uh i was we've been going down this rabbit hole about the african connection in
libya and in north africa specifically deon has been bringing up the taric people who have a blue
indigo die they raise snakes and they uh you know they also uh you are doing a bunch of these kind
of rituals so we're wondering if maybe there's a connection here to uh lady babalon in in that whole
thing yeah i think the best connection there is um the fact that libya you know is not only the home
center of this great oracle you know um but i mean that's why you go in antiquity to libya right
