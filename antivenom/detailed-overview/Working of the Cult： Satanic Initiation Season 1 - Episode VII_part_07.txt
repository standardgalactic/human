you go into the oracle of amon right and and so um is there an association in libya with the drugs
yes particularly with the the serpents you're crazy right um so yeah and the drugs and there's
this famous drug that doesn't grow anymore that nobody can find anymore that's supposed to be
really good for you um right um yeah so um uh and who do we know immigrated from libya through
egypt and up into georgia um to be with um you know the sythians that she became such a
such a proponent of their culture and um yeah yeah i think it's all it's coming through libya
isn't it that's where this lamea is from right that's where the athena is from right so um the
minerva the minerva yeah i love it man it what else what else is out there the other big thing
we're we've been all been searching for is this snake woman the virgin blinded snake woman that
you've been referencing and i know that rech has been looking into this with the melocene and then
i've been looking into this on the indian side and i found connection with the scottis menassa
and uh yeah i think we're finding this figure so i want you to elaborate more what is the purpose
of the the the virgin snake woman and what is this connection here
yeah and why did you get his dirty little hands on on on her as well yeah he had to he couldn't
miss her she's all over the place right even herodotus and 491 and somebody may have posted that
on the discord um but um her herodotus talks about her right and who is this who is this person who
is the half virgin half uh viper um half serpent right and i think what um you know hercules is
doing his thing you know spreading his spreading his worship and his cult and his you know doing
his aero thing he's got his aero toxins from the from the uh centaur that he was you know ultimately
he kills the guy but um from the centaur um that was teaching him and he's spreading that knowledge
right and he's associated indirectly with medea he tries to go on a mission to help her but um
instead the it wasn't to help her it was to kidnap her but instead his little uh boy gets lost he
has a young boy with him and everybody's like okay this is those greeks you know this this is the way
of the of antique no it's not there's a very specific reason he has a boy with them and then
he's involved in a boy cult right get your head out of the story and get it down to the actuality
about why they're writing about these things right so um he's he's he's going around with his cult and
now i've come a little bit of a field of what the question was help refocus me yeah we're just trying
to find this snake virgin right yeah yeah yeah who is this snake virgin snake virgin he does find
the snake virgin right and he finds her in a cave yeah he finds her in a cave right so this is
heronitis this is odd we know that her hercules or heracles was all over the place right we have
shrines to him all over the place he's a big deal he's one of fathers of different um uh peoples
