in Greece right and spread all through the Mediterranean as far as the as far as Spain
so um yeah so um he he meets up with her right and um notice that whenever he gets to the oracle
he's always killing the one who guards her yeah he's always killing the one who guards the trees
right where in which is the fruit yeah you see it's the same machine over and over the the girl
who is half viper half girl is merely the one who is preserving that song she is the oracle
she is that one who can come strangle you right as the sphinx she can come strangle you
i wish people could see that we could bring back the image of her on the horse with the hair
and the poison and the arrows that can turn you to stone you can wake up you can just be some
kid on a farm and you can you can get hunted and wake up in a sexual right that involves the
burning off of your flesh you can be made into the dragon you can be blinded in the process
these are actual things that are going on this is not fairy tale world they did not sit around the
Greece did not sit around and say hmm i wonder how i can create an interesting story from beginning
to end no they took all everything they've been hearing passed down verbally about the great
Heracles and while he stopped here in this place and he did this he stole these cattle and then
something happened he had to go here and he killed the he killed the oracles guardian
you know hydra's dead oh man right so anyway what else do we have going on one thing i want
us to talk about in address i kept getting all these questions surrounding the the resource the
literature that we all assembled and i think some people are coming in late or they missed some of
things but i want us to address what we're searching for as we dig through all of this later
literature that seemingly passed the greek era you know like i want us to talk about the orphic
vox and what is connecting you know lord byron and this uh you know bocaccio and all of these
characters and all this different literature that you've recommended us and what are people
actually searching for like what is what is the point of going to these places and finding this
orphic box here yeah yeah excellent excellent what's the purpose of all of that right um first
when you build a city the very first thing you must do is build a temple to the muses it's the
very first thing that ai if you will as you and i were talking about earlier that ai can only come
when that is accumulated that real intelligence right behind the artificial intelligence that
real intelligence is a quantum phenomenon
so in order for you in order for you to create a society um and i'm not just talking about a
city or government united states or this government in order for you to create a society you must
purify the area for the muse she has to be present and i think that's that's what each of these
