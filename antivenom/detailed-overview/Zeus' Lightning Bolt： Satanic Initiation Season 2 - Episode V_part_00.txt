Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met
I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace
Where is that whore called Destiny
I think she ran on without me
Thank you for coming back to Lady Babylon
Tonight we have a great, great topic to cover
We're going to be looking at Maya, the midwife
And our goal is to bring her into the present
That's right, to reach from the past, from the future
And bring the Mogostokia to life
Beautiful stuff
I've got a video for you tonight about our topic
It's just laced with the most beautiful subliminal messaging
My compliments tonight to Chewie
What I'd like to do is I'd like to just jump into a ship here
And let's just get things going
There's no reason to mess around tonight
Let's go right back, I want to take you right back to a guy named Nonus
And I want to pull his ghost out of grave
And just so you can put him somewhere in history
We're talking about the transition between Roman rule and Christian rule
And there is a big difference
We are living now, we land our ship and we get out of it
And we realize, oh, we are living now at that crossover
When people are afraid to publish
Because the Christian authorities will not only burn their work
But will burn them
So we are dealing with a phenomenon called crypto pagans
And that's what I want to do, is I want to take you tonight to see a crypto pagan
His name is Nonus
And he is able to publish the longest epic in Greek
The longest, the longest by far
And that epic is about Dionysus
An epic about Dionysus
And to start that epic off
We have to start at the heart of the cult of Dionysus
That heart, that inner sanctuary
Is the mogostokia
That is, what is that?
That is the pain of birth
That is the pain that one feels while giving birth
There's a special word for it, the birth pang is usually how it's translated
It's never pleasant, never pleasant
Always painful, it's a portal, a doorway
And this Maya watches over that doorway
She brings the living from that dark death
So, just to explain to all the Christians
That we have invited to come in and please continue inviting
Particularly evangelicals
Because there is a need right now for evangelicals to see the work that we are doing
And for those of you who have come tonight
I want to say we're tracking Jesus
We're following Jesus
Last week we looked at him in the apocalypse
And we found out, we found out that his face glowed as Helios
We saw that gown he was wearing
We saw the wig, the white wig
And we understood he is the Christos
Yes, now we're going to look at the reason
We're tracking that naked boy that was with Jesus when he was arrested
We want to ultimately solve that issue historically
And put it to bed so that people 2,000 years ago
Excuse me, 2,000 years from now
Can be able to say, hey look at these people
We're looking at the reality, right? That's all we ask
Just look at the reason
