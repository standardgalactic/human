They're doing it all the time, right?
They invented it back with Homer
Yeah, right, realize where you are
You are in a place where you are worshiping the muse
Yes, you are in a place where you are worshiping the muse
Silence, silence, holy silence
Yes, somebody was writing to me about dragon tongue
Tracking down dragon tongue
The secret about dragon tongue is that it is spoken
It is spoken in silence
Yes, figure that one out
Perhaps whoever cracks that will be able to track down
The naked boy that Jesus was arrested with
Then we'll all have a Merry Christmas
Epithel, crony da, o diaktoron aithopos auges
That's our first, Dactylic line
That's a Dactylic hexameter
Yeah, and so we're harkening back
You notice that when we're reading the hymns
When we're reading the hymns
We are in a specific ritual meter
Yes, the Romans came up against this Dactylic hexameter
And their response was Saturnian verse
Yeah, the very golden age
These meters are coming alive
And bringing this incredible, incredible wisdom to humanity
Through the muse, you only get there through the muse
What is he saying here?
Crony da, o diaktoron
What is a diaktoron?
He's saying, tell me, muse
He's saying, speak to me of what?
Speak to me of the messenger of the son of Cronus
The messenger of the son of Cronus
Who is he?
He's the diaktoron
The conveyor of the aithopos auges
Auge is that sunlight
It's that sunlight that hits the face
That you can feel that communion with that entity
It's sunlight
Yes, it is a burning
It is a burning
Yeah, aitho
To spark to life, to burn
Yes, good
So we have the descendants of the son in front of us
We have those with that bright, heliac face
The face of Helios
Yeah, remember, there's only a couple of people that are put in those
We use those terms with an antiquity
One of them is Jesus
One of them is the family of the ETs
The members of the family of the ETs
They emanate this from their ops
Here, notice follows that
And we get aithopos
That burning that comes from the ops
You're going to notice
Notice how many of these facial expressions we have
Yes, tell me, Muse, of the mogostokon
Asthma
The asthma, that brief inhalation
That brief exchange with the atmosphere around you
That causes this particular to a woman's birthing process
A woman's birthing process
Okay, fantastic, yes
And what is the source of this?
