This asthma
It is brought to you by the nymphedios
Spintheri
Spintheri is a spark
Boom, and what is a nymphic spark?
What is the spark of the nymphic experience?
Yeah, okay, we're getting again
We just got out of the ship
Give yourself a minute to accumulate, you know
Commodate to the changes and the pressure
Yes, good, good, good, good, good
And what is this breath?
It's the breath of the katalnu
That's a thunderbolt
That's that booming thing that causes you to fear
That causes you to crouch when you hear it
Whether you're a dog or a person or a snake
Yes, it doesn't matter
It has that instinctive fear of sudden fear
Sonic boom, they love that
On the third line
What else are we calling upon?
We're calling on that thalamapolon
What is that?
That's the one who directs within the inner chamber
Specifically the inner chamber of women
Do we have this one?
I want people to see this one because there is
There we go chamber
Thank you
Yes, take a look at this in the definitions here
Watch the word enjoy the Greek and absorb the power here
Just an inner room or chamber
Generally the women's apartment
Inner part of the house
Yes, wow, wow, bedroom, right
It's the place where the valuables are kept
Roman numeral number four on the bottom
Used of certain mystic shrines and chapels
Sacred to opus, the innermost chamber
That's where we are, we're in that innermost chamber
And we have the pole there
What is the pole doing?
The pole is a zone
Thank you, it is a zone
The axis, right?
That's the one ordering and determining the track
That will all go down
Translated, these are servants of the queen
Who serve within her chamber, her inner chamber
Medea had 12 of these
They were her drug procurers and pharmacologists
Yes, Scythians
Very active women with skill in the bow in the arrow
And the use of toxins
Particularly the toxins like the oysters
That are used in the child birthing process
We've seen Christ is linguistically connected
With the insanity produced by the sting of the oysters
That's how we all get in Ostromania
And how we're symbols, right?
We've all seen that
Here it is again
Look at the very word on line 3 for that lightning
Stereo-pain
Stereo-pain
Ster-ops
Look at that, you've got an ops there
