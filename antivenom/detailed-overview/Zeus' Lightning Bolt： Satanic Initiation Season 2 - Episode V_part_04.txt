And you've got the S-T-R root
Right?
That lightning is just a linguistic cousin
Of the oysters
The lightning, bathed in oysters
Comes the child into the world
This is gorgeous
Now, remember, we're surrounded by midwives
Let's see, let's see a couple of them
Line 3 at the end
Ape de fotlen
Bahu
Disotocoyo
Tell me about the nurturing
The naturification
The becoming the nature
The incarnation
The incarnation
Tell me about this
Did you know they had incarnation before?
Oh yeah, no, when Jesus is casting out demons
He's doing it based upon a long tradition
You guys know that
I don't need to tell you that
Let's make sure we're making good time here
I don't want to waste the folks' time
Look at, so tell me about that
Twice-born Bacchus
Wait, you got to be born again?
Yes, you got being born again

It's an old mystery concept

Is there a necessity to cut off the testicles?

Yeah, think about that there for a minute
Just think of it
Take yourself back to Sidon
Take yourself back to that temple
That Lucian writes about
That the Sedonians, where they worship a start
Think about her
The Greeks said that's our hero, by the way
Yeah, yeah
But think about her and the power
Her worshipers
The worshipers of the great mother
Castrate themselves
Yes, if your eye offends
Cast it out, yes
Beautiful, the music was great, by the way
And what happens?
