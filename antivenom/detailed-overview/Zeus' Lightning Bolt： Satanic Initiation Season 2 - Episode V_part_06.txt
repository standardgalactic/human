She could be ethereal
She chooses to be aerial
Yeah, nice, nice, love it
Anyway, let's keep reading
Zeus makes himself the pater
Caipotnia meter
He makes himself, interestingly enough
The father and the queen mother
The queen mother
Interesting, okay
Let's keep reading
Let's keep reading
I've got a little bit more
Yeah, why?
He knows of another birth
Everybody's saying, I forgot to tell you
The gossip is coming through the sibles
Zeus Jehovah Jove
The father god is destined to be overthrown
So this is what's perpetuating
All of this action
Again, evangelicals
I'm talking to the people who are here
Who hear the analog
They hear the analog
They know what's being said
They can decode

Yes, and from the temple of his head
He pours out
Now this is funny
The translation that the Harvard people use
Is old
And every time somebody can't
The translator can't figure out
What NONUS is doing
Because NONUS is using
I'm filtering this out for you
But NONUS is using words that only appear
Those Hapox Legoma
They only appear once
And we only have this citation of it
And there are words that he is obviously creating
A lot of them
Are words that he is obviously creating
But of the ones that aren't
That aren't his working
That they just happen to be
Hapox Legoma
Those have a share in an antiquity
That we can't
I mean, those are the real finds
Linguistically, those are the jewels
That are in it
And every once in a while
You come across one of those
That gives you an insight into the cult
The cult operation
And then you can see that mystery
Just a little bit more clearly
And we have some of that here
Because Zeus
He sends out
He emits Athena
He emits Athena
