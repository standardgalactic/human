Emits Athena
And it's not just a sin
As you and I would think of to sin
It means to send as in
To push water or a fluid
To push water
To squirt
So in the mind of the ancient Greek
Zeus is conveying
And why is it, why do we know
This is a sexual reference
Because she is considered the asporon
She is considered the seedless
Yeah, she is considered the seedless
She springs solely
From that mind
And she is the astraptusan
The one who brings the lightning
The astrape
You'll notice it's just strape, right?
The asterion
Is just the str root
In use
So here once again
Connected with the very power of God
You all know that lightning is connected with God
Whether you're reading the Old Testament
Or whether you're reading some pagan works, right?
You know that that God the Father
Is a God of lightning
You didn't know what the lightning was before now
The lightning is that which bathes
The morostokia
Bathes that process
Of the ultimate pain of birth
Of bringing that entity into life
Right, bringing life from death
So Maya, the midwife
Becomes the one linchpin of the entire mystery
It's the linchpin that the Christians removed
Right, we know it's unfortunate
We know what happened was unfortunate
That Jesus got caught
In a public park with a naked boy
And arrested and condemned
And yelled at by a mob
And forced to go to death
In the place of a dude who they knew
Had killed someone
Yeah, so we're trying to find
It's unfortunate, that's how the circumstances ended up
And he ends up dying on the cross
Before his time, right?
But he is that one
To whom is brought the drugs
And the financing
That he can carry the title of the yeson
Yes, that he can be the Christos
Why? Because the asterion
Has brought us to him
Because we followed the star
Right, so I want you to see the context
And I want you to remember
We need to see a dance
Because we are at a place
Where we have to constantly remind ourselves
And this is good for the evangelicals as well
And please, invite your evangelical friends
