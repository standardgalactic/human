Please
We are at a place where we have to stop
And say, wait a minute
Let's just get a historical perspective here
Who is the oldest goddess?
Who is the oldest divinity?
Is it Jehovah? Who is it?
So, from this lightning
Now, you want those symbols
You want the real ones
You want the old ones, right?
That's what we're all looking for
And that's why we're pounding down
The Aryan connection
And the archers
The archers who are on the Scythian steeps
Yeah, what are we doing there?
We're living in a world with arrows
And we're living in a world with poisons
And we're transferring culture
Through these migrations that we're having
And all of it is ending up in this old, old, old poetry
And somehow we're getting these lines
We're getting these lines about these individuals
Yeah, yeah
So where does that bring us?
Where does that bring us?
Yeah
We come to the source
We have to have the lightning
We have to know what they're doing with the lightning
We have to have the wa-wa-wanasa
We have to have that power
We have to find her
And we have to bring her forward
And in order to do so, we have to go into the language
And we have to pull out very basic elements
The scientific stuff that's there
You guys have been following this
And many of you have been tracking on the Discord
And you're working with other sources
And seeing how the mystery is pursued across time
And I'm hoping that with enough work
We can elucidate a broader history
Of the working of the mystery
Instead of its hijacking by the dude Moses
And its hijacking by the dude Jesus
We can go back and we can see it in its original form
And find that Maya
What is the lightning that she bays the infant in?
What is that Ba'akik power?
Why are we here for the goddess?
It's because of that power
There was a river
I want to finish tonight
I encourage you to look at the river Arathusa
Because she was a witness
She didn't want to succumb to domination
So she became a witness
She flowed through the underworld
And saw the Korah
The great Korah
She saw her the Korwa Nasa
She saw her
And witnessed her place as a queen
She was the one who said
Demeter, you've got to let these humans live
You've got to let these humans live
