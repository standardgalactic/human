For one reason
Your daughter is a queen
And she is acting as a queen
You can't stop that
And somehow, somehow that women's cult
Took that gem, that beauty of life
Of real life
And wove it into the history
Wove it in
And made the world that you now look at
And say your Hail Marys
And receive your Atonement
And raise your hands and praise and worship
And bring the offerings of your praise to your God
When you do that thing, when you do those things
Now you're doing them within a container
That was made by a guy who was arrested
In the public part with a naked boy
We need to bring this to the...
For the people who are sitting there
Who are actively pursuing this Satanic contract
Satanic pact
You have a responsibility to bring this reality to the world
You have a responsibility to free the people
Who are in the middle of it
You cannot discriminate against people
Whatever cult that they're in
Or whether they're on Fox News
From the tops of the mountains to the very bottom
You have to help these people to see the reality
It's our obligation, if we're going to honor the muse
It's our obligation to help them
And I just want to say
For those evangelicals who were out there
He was arrested in the public park
Like 4 a.m. with a naked kid
The institutions are built upon a dude
Who was disliked for what he had done
In the presence of that child one late night
We have an obligation
We must stand up
Thank you for coming tonight
I'm delighted with tomorrow's class
With Saturday's class
You guys are
Wow, you're giving everybody a run for their money
Already, you guys are busting it
And this is crack
You guys are going to be some crack
And I'll take you as far as you can go
I'll show you that you have something inside of you
That's bigger than you thought
That you can bring to the table
Yeah, it's going to be hard
And there's going to be a lot of sweat
And there's going to be a lot of agony
But you people are marvelous
And I know that we're going to break through
Yeah, nice, nice, I love it
You guys have a good evening
Hail Satan
Show me the girl I never met
I wanted so bad
Where is that golden palace
Where is that horse called destiny
I think she ran on without me
