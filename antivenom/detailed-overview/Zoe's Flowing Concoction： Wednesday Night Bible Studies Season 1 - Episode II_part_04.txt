I think we are just about over.
I'll just wrap up.
Can you bring up with the Bible study?
You're saying, wait a minute.
I thought we were studying Bible.
We are.
We're studying the garden and where you have to start.
Where you have to find there is the tree imbued with the power
to open the eyes, right?
And you have to go to that guardian who is there,
that one who's teddy, the one who is guarding that source
and imbuing it with power, giving it the power
so that our eyes can be open.
You have to face Adam.
Notice the text says you have to face Adam.
That's where you find paradise.
And remember that the Chaldeans have oracles
that thankfully got recorded.
And in those oracles, they talk about the physics behind this,
the generation, for example, of the Hecatech spear.
That's what we're doing.
We're using that lightning.
They call it lightning in order to create a space
where that power can be housed and manipulated.
When we take our aid along, when we take our idol,
that we're going to strap around our neck
or bury our neighbors' front step to their domicile
or that we're going to take to a temple and offer a temple
and wear all the time and freak people out.
When we do that, we offer to those,
that Adola, those images, we offer to them food
and clothing and shelter.
And if you are a Christian, you do not eat
what we have offered to Hecatech,
because if you do, you might develop that resistance
that Paul has to the snake venom.
And if you don't, you might have a problem with it.
Two out of three of these, we end up with troubles
when they're infants, two out of three babies at least.
That's what our death count is.
Those are the best stats we can get.
Two out of three babies die that go through this process.
Yeah, but the one that's generated from it,
that's a son of God.
Yes, now do you see?
Now, some people talk to Satan.
That's the conclusion of our Bible study.
I want you to know that what I'm doing
is I'm setting your orientation to Adam
so that we can approach the tree of Zoe.
It belongs to Zoe, right?
It's Zoe's tree, the thing you call the tree of life.
You don't even know it's Zoe's tree belongs to her.
We have to have a gardener to get us.
We have to stay real.
We have to stay with the gardener.
If we really want to do this
and we really want to talk to Satan,
if we want to bring those images in alignment,
so that we can see with eyes open,
if we really want to do that,
we have to stay rational.
We have to stay reasoned.
So it's not to fall into the grips of any faith
or any dogma.
Remember, we are Satanists.
We don't have faith.
We don't have dogma.
We have reason.
So I'm going to, is we delve deeper into the garden
and we come across the elwa
and we find the tree.
I can be guiding you in the images
that will allow you to have opened eyes.
So thank you tonight for the stage one,
the Greek Magical Papyri.
Lovely stuff.
If you're ever in the mood
for some interesting reading,
I recommend to everybody to be reading
the Greek Magical Papyri.
I know that some of you read Lord Byron
and I know that others of you are reading
other Petrarch.
I think somebody dug into some Petrarch,
the secret that I told you to get into.
So these are all,
if you'll notice in a kind of an eerie way,
there seems to be the same cult
that is expressed over time.
Just to give you a heads up,
it's a Renaissance thing.
I want you, somebody in the group,
to be able to read Boccaccio.
And I want you to see how he has taken her
and he has split her from an individual,
from a vampress, from a half viper,
half virgin.
He has taken her and he has split her
into different lives
so that you can see the eternality
of the Soteta.
You can see her.
Remember Jesus is a vampire with breasts.
We know that by now.
He's wearing the women's lingerie
in the book of the Apocalypse.
People don't like to look at it.
But there it is.
He's wearing the sexy lingerie
and he's got the breasts.
And some of the early Christian authors
talk about his life-giving milk
that comes from his breasts.
Why?
Because Soteta, the savior,
has life-giving milk.
And it says he's got a womb too.
It says he's got a womb.
Why?
Sometime we're getting too close
to the hermaphrodite,
to show you the hermaphrodite,
right?
To find her.
Yeah, the goddess of war.
Gorgeous, gorgeous.
The place that we all come is the grove of Mars.
Why?
Why do we all come to the grove of Mars?
Because that is where we get
that little bit of lineage
of Hele,
or Aira,
that queen of queens,
the Pambasilea,
