right?
And she is, if I recall you that up and show you,
she is that Venus.
And you'd be surprised because you'd be like,
I didn't know Hera was that.
Yeah, guess what?
It's Trinity.
And she is a virgin mother queen
who is desire.
Everybody's always shocked.
That freshman in college,
love to ask this.
Who is the best looking goddess?
Right?
Who is the best looking goddess?
And they don't understand,
they don't understand that
as in the contest
of Paris,
of which goddess deserves
the golden apple,
right?
As was pointed out
with that entire,
everything business,
the
apple belongs to the Trinity
of the virgin,
the queen of queens,
and desire.
Yeah,
it's gorgeous,
it's gorgeous,
and they understand it.
Okay, I would like to ask if we have,
I'm going to look at your comments
and maybe flash a couple
of comments up here that are directly relevant.
So,
let me just go here.
Let's see here.
Yeah, somebody,
you don't have to flash a comment up.
What about Dante?
Doesn't Dante have a civil?
Ew.
Okay, you who wrote that about Dante,
call up his ghost,
find us the civil,
find us the burning purple,
would you do that please?
Thank you.
No, that's right.
Hey, there's another one here.
Let's see what we got here.
Are you telling me the wound in Jesus' side
was his vagina?
Absolutely not.
He's better than that, right?
No, absolutely not.
But you know what came out of that wound when they poked him?
Because he was already dead.
Most people don't realize that.
They were surprised that he was already dead.
It takes long to die from crucifixion, right?
It's not blood loss, you're not dying from blood loss.
Yeah, so
you're dying from strangulation,
slow strangulation.
Anyway,
you had to be there, right?
And the guys that were there, they poked him.
They poked him in the side
because they didn't know why he was dead.
They were like, dude, it's faking it, right?
Here, Lanson,
when they spilled out all that water in that blood,
dude was thirsty, drinking lots of water
just like
we know that they do
when they're under the influence of the dipsass.
Yeah, in the mystery.
It makes you really thirsty, it gives you polydipsia.
Yeah.
There's an antidote for it.
They tried to give Jesus the vinegar on the cross.
Right?
Vinegar, that word vinegar,
is their word in the geoponica
for the antidote to the dipsass.
Which would make you be yelling out and
thirsting.
So are there any drugs that are being used?
Not only are there drugs
that are being used in these texts.
Not only did the Romans
use drugs,
but your entire history
of what you have thought Christianity
was
is
because of its drugs.
You have no idea
of no ideal.
You have no idea why
the Pope pardoned Mary Magdalene
for using sex drugs,
for possessing sex drugs.
You have no idea, right?
It's a whole world we have.
It's not made it through the filter.
Okay, let's go to more questions.
Yeah, Jesus wore women's lingerie.
Can you tell us more?
Yeah, go to the apocalypse
and watch him.
You know, I had a
I had a student this week
tell me
I was working with her
in some Greek literature.
We were doing Plato
symposium.
We were talking about
Eros and who is Eros.
What that means
we were with the Socratics
and the flute girls
and Alcibiades
was getting kind of out of hand.
Anyway, they got some stuff going on.
But
in the
process
I
asked her to convey
