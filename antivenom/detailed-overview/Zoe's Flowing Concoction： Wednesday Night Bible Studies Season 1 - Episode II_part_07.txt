and made young boys the heart of the mystery
you said it happened before Christians
was it Pythagoras
right at the beginning
is a great question
Lord Snappy
yes
right from the beginning
as the right is emerging
there is a movement
to make it into
a boys
only initiation
and it's done
by examples put all over the Mediterranean
under
the name
of
Heracles
the glory of Hera
the glory of Hera
do you see that we're back to the original trinity
that's in the mystery
and Heracles is known
in his cult
it's only men and boys
it's
the Rastea
and why is it men and boys because it was
a woman
and a boy
and the only woman that's allowed
to come to these cult
activities
is one that's the Medwa
the Medea
that's it she can only come in
and why is that
why is that because
it's her dark harbor
right Hera in her orific hymn
is
the one
who remains within
who functions within
the dark harbor
the dark harbor that we were talking about
right we're working on this formula
and we know that the Galene
allows us to function
right the Helaudia
allows us Helaudia
allows us to function within the dark harbor
yeah
nice so who took her out

have to give an academic answer
