I challenge anybody to find one piece of information in the Bible that you can prove to be false, not that you...
Oh, this is super easy, and you can do it yourself.
So we're going to ignore the fact that the Bible says that the earth is flat and that it's 6,000 years old and totally gets everything about cosmology wrong,
and we're going to look at specifically the Bible to disprove the Bible.
So the beautiful thing about the four Gospels is they tell essentially the same stories from four different anonymous accounts.
So we can compare these accounts and just, if you ask specific questions, you get contradictory answers.
So when someone tells me that the Bible is the perfect Word of God, I ask them any of the questions on this list.
And this is just a short list from probably the most important part of the Bible, the resurrection.
What were Jesus' last words on the cross?
When did the last supper occur?
Who went to the empty tomb?
Was the stone rolled away when they got there?
Who did they see when they got there?
Were the disciples told to stay in Jerusalem or go to Galilee?
Did the women tell the disciples or tell no one because they were afraid?
What did the disciples do?
And when was Jesus supposed to have returned?
