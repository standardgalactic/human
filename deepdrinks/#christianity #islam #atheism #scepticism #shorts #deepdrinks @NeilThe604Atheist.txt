Once you've seen behind the curtain, it's hard to close that curtain again and think that the
wizard is real. The advice that I would give to somebody is definitely like if you're starting
to have questions, if some of this stuff is starting to kind of wiggle your brain a little bit,
like this really isn't computing, like never stop asking questions, never stop researching,
go deep into your belief system, never stop researching what it's all about, how it originated,
that kind of thing, and you'll slowly start to like an onion, you'll slowly start to peel away
these layers and realize that this stuff is really just like any other deity-driven belief system,
they're mythologies, they are all part of the human imagination. So keep questioning and keep
looking into that. I've always used the Wizard of Oz as a bit of an example.
