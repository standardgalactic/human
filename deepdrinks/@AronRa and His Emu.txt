twice a week, I would walk the six foot, six inch tall bird
down the park and and let him run and I would bring a bicycle
with me not to not to keep up because you can't but to catch
up because as soon as his feet hit the grass, he would do this
weird thing with his head and you'd zoom right and he would
just run for a moment. He would just run it super stupid
speed. And now I've got to catch up with him. But then he would
spend the rest of the afternoon just like sauntering along the
park and it was nice. I was just I would just enjoy walking
along the park with my email. I don't know what kind of
neighborhood you live in but I can see why that would be
terrifying to someone. You'd essentially look dinosaur running
around a neighborhood. I would be terrified. I'd be like, what is
this madman doing?
