I got divorced from a really amazing person today. We were together for 18 years and I loved him.
My biggest fear was that something would suddenly happen to him, then that I'd lose him,
and then it came true. I thought the dying was the worst thing that could happen to him,
but what actually happened was so much worse. Horrifying. And she tells me that he came out
of his office saying his head hurt. He was sweating and like trying to pull his clothes off,
and then he hits the floor and has a seizure. I get over there. I'm in total shock and denial.
I'm like trying to tell people everything's fine. They whisk him off to surgery that they told me
he probably wouldn't survive. He did, but they had to take out a chunk of his brain and remove
a big part of his skull. So fast forward to the day that I'm going to turn off life support,
and he wakes up. But he wakes up so different. The doctors told me that even though my husband
was awake, he would never be capable of meaningful human connection ever again. Now I'm a serial
optimist and a fighter, and when people tell me that something's not possible, I always kind of
halfway hear it. You know, I'm like, thanks. Okay, we'll see.
