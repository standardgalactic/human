Hi everyone, this is Dave, just off the cuff.
I have two pieces of important information for you.
So as you may know,
we had two amazing panels happening this weekend.
We had the slavery apologetics panel,
which was the original crew from the first slavery panel,
just doing an aftermath and just responding
to some of the apologetics and the aftermath
of what happened to the first one.
And then the very next day,
we were going to be running a seven hour charity stream
to help raise money for Ukraine
and sexual minorities Uganda in the wake
of the horrible anti-LGBT laws
that have just passed in Uganda.
I have decided for that second event
for the charity stream to push that out
by another month or so.
And the reason is because I want to make sure
that I can do the event justice.
And it was starting to feel a little bit rushed.
And I want to make sure I can give everyone enough time
to prepare, we can get some amazing guests on
and we can produce an awesome seven hour stream.
Because I think the main thing is
to help these charities raise money.
So I hope that's okay with everyone.
Please look forward to some amazing content
and I'm just, I'm trying to do my best.
Love you guys.
