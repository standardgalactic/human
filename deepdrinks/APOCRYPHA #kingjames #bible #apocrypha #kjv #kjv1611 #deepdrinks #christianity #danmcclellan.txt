You had the Old Testament, you had the Apocrypha,
and then you had the New Testament.
And the Apocrypha is in the 1611 King James Version.
It was published by Protestants for centuries.
And it wasn't until the 19th century
when you had the British and Foreign Bible Society in the UK
and the American Bible Society in the United States
that we're trying to share Bibles
and spread them all over the place.
The American Bible Society had the goal
of putting a Bible in every home in America.
And I think they managed to place something
like 500,000 Bibles in one year.
They were very aggressive.
But one of the things they did to make their printing
and their distribution more efficient was
they began to produce Bibles
that did not include the Apocrypha
that just had the Old Testament and the New Testament.
And by the end of the 19th century,
this became kind of the de facto authoritative version
of the Bible.
