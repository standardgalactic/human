in my particular Amish church, they actually strictly forbid using any English written Bible.
They say that any other translation outside of that is being used by the devil to try to deceive
them away from the truth. So they wouldn't, they will actually be willing to cut any other Bible
up and burn them. They have no problem with that because they believe that it's demonic
and of the devil. So yeah, I actually got a video here soon that I'm going to share on my social
media where one of us, our former Amish buddies actually was on a construction site and caught
some of the Amish actually taking cases and cases of Bibles and cutting them up and burning them
because they were not the Martin Luther Bible. Wow.
