So when we put this Amish rescue mission sign up,
he found us as a threat.
This billboard sign that you're showing right now
is diagonals from the Amish school.
And he did not wanna have any of the children,
the young boys, young girls, victims
to see this information and call us to be rescued.
The stories we kept hearing from this Amish community
was that he was even taking other men's wives from them.
He would claim to be like the prophet Moses,
like the prophet Elijah in the Bible, or Isaiah.
Many people believed he was a true prophet
and that he was hearing directly from God.
So even some testimonies we were hearing
where men felt like it was an honor
to give their wives to him to have children with.
He has literally fathered over 50 plus children
with many different men's wives in that community.
