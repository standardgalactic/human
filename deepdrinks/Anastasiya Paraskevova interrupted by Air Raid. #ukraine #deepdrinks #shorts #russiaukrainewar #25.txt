oh my god so this is for a little beta hook and yeah air raids just start happening
and you seem so casual about it like well it must be you must be so desensitized at this stage
to the constant threat against your life yeah the explosion can kill you the shrapnel can kill you
glass from the window broken can kill you and it's better to go somewhere when there is like two
three walls between you and like the outsides of the house
