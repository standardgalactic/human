We have this text that says,
ball smote Lothan, the wriggling serpent.
Lothan, the twisting serpent, the dragon with seven heads.
And the words that use there,
the order that they occur in
for those adjectival references to Leviathan
are identical across the two languages.
So it certainly seems like whoever wrote this text
500 years before Isaiah was ever born,
Isaiah seems to have access either to that text
or to some other version of that text.
And so there are a bunch of indications that
the Bible is influenced by this other literature
to some degree or another.
