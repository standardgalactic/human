Hi, this is David from Deep Drinks Podcast, and apparently this is the first time I've been filmed on a GoPro.
I'm currently up the beach working for Vito Media. Our guests coming up, apparently this is the first time on GoPro.
My guest coming up is Linda K. Klein, the author of Pure, which will be fantastic.
And then we have Derek Lambert, and we have Not-So-Aerodite, and apparently...
Then we have the 100th episode of Deep Drinks.
