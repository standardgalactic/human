50 years ago, or 200 years ago, when the blacks were slaves, did they ever go to Washington,
D.C., and have a rally 200 years ago to protest against slavery?
Did they?
No.
What did they do?
Well, a lot of good people in the plantations would say, hey, it's winter time.
Let us help build a church for you, dear folks.
They loved them and taught them how to read, so they could read the Bible.
And here's what the blacks did about 150 years ago.
They humbled themselves.
They prayed.
They sought God's face, and they turned from their wicked ways, and God made slavery illegal
through a several white presidents, right?
It worked, didn't it?
They didn't protest.
