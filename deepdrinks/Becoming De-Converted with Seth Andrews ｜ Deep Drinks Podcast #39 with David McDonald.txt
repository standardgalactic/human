and evidence since its launch in 2010 the thinking atheist podcast has been downloaded over 50 million
times set has authored five books including his latest offering christianity made me talk like
an idiot which is fantastic i blasted through that bad boy in one day it was it just was mind
blowing for me uh with mix of humor and heart set andries has spoken to audiences largest
in the u.s canada europe and australia about his former faith the promotion of science and
scientific skepticism the importance of humanism and why we should all pursue a personal
relationship with reality without further ado i would like to welcome the man with the golden
voice seth andries it's gonna be here thanks for the invitation much appreciated bro thank you so
much for coming out it's uh it's i know we're just a small podcast but it's um i'd really do
appreciate you taking the time uh to come out here and chat some deep topics with us you bet now
it's nice to be asked thanks for the invitation uh what's uh what are we drinking today sir well
you know i'm a coffee guy cream sugar like a lot of cream and sugar but i just came out of
strep throughout um which sucked it was just awful and so i was doing a ton of sort of flavor
teas and i don't know spicy teas and smooth teas and whatnot so i just been in the habit of drinking
tea so today i've got this sort of pumpkin tea sweetened hot tea and that's what i'm drinking today
awesome and i so initially you told me coffee so i prepared a coffee and i was i could have i
this is the first time i could have gone and made some tea but for me it's 7 a.m and i just
i just like no i want my coffee so i've got my we've got an iced coffee here chilling ready to go
as we get into it i'm bad you know it's funny i ran out of my um you know i go through i don't buy
the fancy stuff but um i would sit the store and they have a brand it was on the counter called
death wish coffee which i guess is one of the most caffeinated brands of coffee on sale it's got a
skull and crossbones on a black bag filled with coffee and i thought okay i'll give it a shot
and you know the stuff's not bad like for the for the money i wouldn't do it again it's like 20
bucks for the bag but you know okay it was it was all right it was pretty good you know i was waiting
for my fingers to shake and for my lip to quiver and for my eyes to become wide uh that didn't happen
but i did get a chance to experience the death wish coffee so that was something i like someone
should try at least once in their lives yeah yeah it's like eating a really hot chili or something
it's like you just gotta you gotta live live it live it to the max yeah so um normally i don't do this
but i'm thinking we should do it uh i want to ask you a question um really deep question just to
jump straight into it if you could talk to your younger christian self and impart one message
what would it be and besides like lottery numbers and things yeah yeah it's funny i i just finished
writing a speech that has that question in it it's a speech that i'm going to be giving throughout
the country but the first time is when i speak at the florida freethought event in orlando coming
up middle of march and and because i have reflected on that if i was to get back in the way back machine
what would i say and it's hard to distill it down because it always sounds like a bumper sticker
but i think if i had to beyond question everything would be question authority that would
be the number one because christianity is an authoritarian model by design uh ya always an
authoritarian god and there's a hierarchy usually male that's placed over you and they say well you
know obey i am the authority we see this in clergy who claim authority over their congregants of
course we see this with elders in the family you know well it's your mother it's your father you
gotta do what they say well i understand that to a degree if you're a young child and they are
protecting you but i think to be able to look at these sort of sacred icons the ones who were
supposed to know everything the ones who we thought were just uh you know wiser than us and often
they would give us the answer and kill curiosity in us they wouldn't say go out challenge me check
this and if you learn something new tell me what it is and let's make every day of discovery
you know they didn't do that they said here's how you want to think about this and if you don't
you're wrong uh you're in sin you're weak you're going to hell so if i could go back in time question
authority you know that would be an empowering piece of advice and if somebody anybody ever comes
to me and they say well you're not allowed to ask about this i'd be like all right congratulations
you've now put that number one on my whatever it is that you say i'm not allowed to question or
challenge that is now number one on my list and i'm going to go out and so that's the advice
i would probably give my younger self today you know it's interesting i mean it's funny it's like
the the cockiness of youth you think you know everything when i was 16 70 you couldn't tell me
anything i was smug i was so you know confident that i've been born into the right religion and
everybody else was deceived and don't even get me started on those atheists i was incurious
and in a smug kind of way that just shut my brain off and i kicked myself because it was really
decades before i became hugely aware of how much i don't know the more i learned the more i realized
i did not know and that didn't suck the joy out of my life it made me want to know more anyway
and every day did become a discovery and my whole universe opened up and i think about
the time i wasted if i had not been so smug and incurious at the time imagine how much further
along i'd be today i do remember when when i and i need to thank you too because part of my
deconstructing journey a lot of it was watching matt delahunty's scream at people on the atheist
experience and watching arun takedown ken hoven but there was a part of it that was watching your
content that helped me kind of process my journey so i want to thank you for that first of all
but but i remember when i first like came the fog lifted the the the spell was broken when i first
uh had a personal relationship when i first invited reality into my heart i um i it was like
being dropped in an alien world where it was like i had to read it's like i had to read like
everything was new like it was like wait wait so evolution is a thing that that actually happened
and and dinosaurs existed and i can go to the fossil shop where i've got around here and i can get
a fossil and it's actually like 65 million years old it's not like fake news you know and it was it was
it was amazing and and you know like i started looking into big bang cosmology and like and all
this stuff that we learned that i just dismissed as a christian and um and it was amazing it was it was
a for me the the deep converting experience um was the most heartbreaking but exciting time of my life
it was it was the whirlwind of emotions i think that applies to so much i was like you i used to i was
trained to make fun of evolution didn't know anything about it never read any legitimate science
books explaining it or teaching it i just knew it was wrong we just made fun of it in our ignorance
but also you know when you slough off the shackles of superstition and you find yourself back at
square one and you think well how much of how i feel about things was informed by my faith and i
had to go back point by point in terms of my values and say well how do i feel about this and it ended
up transforming so much how do i i used to be a death penalty guy you know i for an eye you know code of
hamarabi ironically you know and i went back and i actually began to research you know how effective
is it is it a moral thing are there discrepancies based on income level and and race and is it you
know is it right to is that a solution you know if you kill someone will kill you back and i ended
up reversing my position when it came to the legalization of marijuana i used to be this moral
pulpit pounder kind of guy and now i'm like who cares uh you know it's ironic that we live in a country
where alcohol is flows freely but weed is apparently a problem and you know reproductive choice
LGBT rights gay marriage right to die issues um healthcare world policy foreign affairs other
religions all of these things i had developed my opinion about them because at a time when i was
looking through god glasses and so if you leave the faith you find yourself going well wait a minute
i need to go reevaluate and it is astounding how differently i saw the world and how i'd come to
totally different conclusions when i started thinking for myself people look at me and they're
like well what happened to you and i'm i'm like well have a seat let me tell you you know because i
i am i now stand in contrast to the vast majority of my evangelical relatives who look at me and wonder
what in the world happened to this guy the the branch is broken on the family tree the apple fell
from the tree and rolled down the hill and landed in the that's kind of where i fell i i often have this um
this fantasy about because i always i get that question as well from family and friends and um
and i can step them through like each step of my thinking and i have this like a desire to like
lock them in a room and be like okay we're not like let's let's let's let's talk about this let's
like really like break down the issues like we're not leaving until this is like until you
understand where i'm coming from um i just have this because like because it always like moves into
conjecture and and you know like there's no you can't you can't get them to grip onto anything
that you're saying because they move from one topic to another and things like that and i just wish
i wish i could like i wonder often if i could if i could actually have a conversation with my
young zealot self if i could talk myself out of what i was experiencing okay that's a great question
too you know we've done a lot of talking on the show about the psychology behind belief what happens
if you challenge a belief that is linked to someone's identity whether it's religion or politics
especially and brain science reveals that the same part of our brains activate with an ideological
threat as it does with a physical threat the amygdala fires up in the same way which is why you and
i can go in and totally dismantle the book of genesis people say well i believe that humanity is
is the product of two nudists in a garden with talking animals and you and i go through and we're
like all right well hang on just a second we lay out the facts thinking that the data is going to make
a dent how often if we not only not gotten any traction but the people doubled down and they got
defensive and now i believe it doubly and you're going to hell and i'll pray for you and it's because
many of these people have a belief that's linked to their identity and they are going to jump into a
defensive posture anytime they feel that they or their beliefs are unsafe and if i was to go back
and talk to my younger self for that reason i would not go back and throw data at them here's what
the facts are damn it and here's what the science says i would use a lot of questions i would never
make my younger self feel attacked or unsafe i would come to them in a position where we were just
kind of you know being real together and i would use i a lot and say well i've gone through this and i've
i've experienced a few and i'm amazed at learning this and you know if you're curious i would love
that the opportunity to to sort of pick your brain and then talk about this and i would use very soft
language because the younger self encountering the older self would have probably doubled down
folded his arms put the walls up and said you'll never change my mind i'll pray for you god bless
that's probably what i would have done uh i uh i yeah it's amazing do you do you
did you have facebook or some form of social media when you're a christian that you still have access to
uh let's see facebook started what 2006 or five something like that i mean i i i left the faith
it's funny i i really went dormant in my christianity around 2000 2001 and kind of did that thing where i
i kind of existed on the outer membrane conveniently wearing christianity on my you were the seeds
seeds scattered on the path yeah i'm like oh yeah i'm a christian i mean i don't i didn't go to church
i didn't pray i didn't participate in the faith but it was just kind of that well of course there's a
jesus you know if somebody asked me at a party but you know it was 2007 when i really got serious
about trying to figure it out so you know a lot of social media i tell you what i noticed about
my early days in social media was how differently i thought politically you know god is a republican
yeah i had that kind of kind of do would it would god have been a trump republican or a
non-trump republican it depends on which god if you cherry picked the bible to find the best
version of jesus there is no way i mean you know jesus was problematic and we can have that
conversation but if you think about donald trump in terms in terms of american christianity and you
think about the teaching of jesus grow all right what are the teachings in the bible that we can
we might be able to call admirable be humble that's not trump don't love money that's not trump
be faithful to your spouse that's not trump don't lust that's not trump don't take vengeance
because vengeance is god's that's not trump don't bear false witness or lie or covet i mean
a time and it don't be cruel love the love the poor and the disadvantaged trump fails on every
single level which is one of the reasons it's so maddening to watch these bible banging evangelicals
in my country worship the guy who is really the antithesis of the best version of their god
and i've come to the point now where either they've been so primed for authoritarianism that an
authoritarian figure right they don't see a president with trump they saw a king they saw a king
absolutely yeah and they're primed by their faith to respond to a divine king figure so all he has to do
is wave a bible he does not read in front of a church he does not attend and that triggers that in their
brain there's god's divine appointment and we will blindly follow him i think there were other people
who are genuinely cruel and they loved his cruelty they felt like that strength we're not
going to take any crap i think there were other people where it was just transactional yeah he can be
the most horrible person in the world but he's going to give me what i want was which is a christian
dominionist culture where we call the shots you know we get the power so yeah he's you know he's an a-hole but
hey it's okay you know god uses flawed people and he's going to give us what we want yeah i used to say
god used to donkey he can use anyone yeah i don't if i was i don't think i would have
bought trump i will say i was still a skeptic when i was a christian i used to go after like my parents
met at oral roberts university and if you don't know people don't know who oral roberts is
he was a tent evangelist and a faith healer back in the 60s he used to put these tents up and he
traveled around people had come and he would be like oh and he'd heal people and they'd cast off their
crutches and it was exposed later that they were actors and they would travel with him and he built a
um uh he built a university in my hometown and then he had this vision and he said he saw a 900 foot
tall jesus that appeared before him and told him to build this skyscraper which will be
dedicated and he has to raise millions and millions and million please send me your money because the 900
foot jesus has adorned this and even when i was a devout believer i thought this guy's full of crap
this guy's a grifter there's no way and so i'd like to think there was a skeptic in me somewhere
and i think if i'd been that guy and seen donald trump i would have had the same response this guy's a con
don the con the grifter he's uh you know the bankruptor in chief uh beware i'd like to think i would
have seen him coming but who he's uh trump definitely has he's he's grabbed the evangelicals right
by the pussy is like is the word i like to say uh yeah it's just i i just see so many um evangelicals
like they post about trump like he's not a perfect man but he's amazing um and you're like come on um anyway
i i don't know how you get there let's say he didn't invoke the name of god let's just say you
look at him as a human being what about that is impressive but what about that guy in the
childishness and the name calling and the tantrums and the bizarre he called himself claire voyant
the other day in a post on truth social i mean he claire voyant you know he's putting these uh
NFTs or whatever out where he's a superhero with muscles and whatnot lasers coming out of his eyes and
i mean who would look at that and be impressed and i can't i can't help it but i i judge people
i'm guilty i look at someone who looks at that and they go oh what an amazing man and i think
i am judging you now i am judging i'm making a judgment call about your intelligence
and your character right now i am doing so it's funny we we started this podcast with um talking
about um rejecting god um and then we've moved on to um rejecting trump and i feel like the trump
is more the trump part's more offensive to people i feel like people if someone was was here a christian
believing um trump supporter they would have left on the trump conversation but not on the god
not on the part we're talking about there it's possible and and there's some interesting science
on this pardon me it is almost harder for people to disagree about politics than it is for them to
disagree about religion now religion is often existing in the periphery in the ethereal people
or you know they practice a cultural faith they go to church they have a bible they don't really
know what's in it but it's kind of a cultural thing but politics really links more to people's values
how they see the world and we often find that when you engage people in subjects about religion
you'll get some judgment you'll get some piety and you'll get some nastiness from time to time
but more often when you talk politics you know your family dinner at thanksgiving and somebody
brings up the president or a former president or whatever that's when the sparks really fly
and i think it's because often our political viewpoints are linked to a value system talk about
taking something personally but i you know i have found that phenomenon to be uh you know a legitimate
one it does happen when you talk politics yeah i've always i've always been not always but i've
recently thought that maybe a direct democracy could be a better idea than um than what we have
got now where instead of electing leaders we just elect we you know people get educated and
elect certain policies that they think are good policies and then the leaders that best represent
those policies get put into um to make sure those policies get done but i also don't know
very much about politics so who knows if that's a good idea um so moving um back onto your story
what i i need to i need to know what kind of christian were you
back before you became deconverted well did you have a relationship with jesus let me distill
this down yeah yeah i i had kind of a potpourri of christianity of my life my father was ex
lutheran extremely conservative my mother was a penny costal you know and she believed in
speaking in other tongues and and not yeah so it was a clash of cultures i went to a bamboo school
so i kind of had this uh a taste of a lot of it and i was able to kind of choose which one i was most
comfortable with which was the more conservative on the loud person um i'm an introvert which surprises
some people um i did believe in jesus i believe god was watching everything you know when i was
a kid i remember i would be a i felt like i'm a sinner i'm sinning you know and i would always
say the prayer under my breath please please forgive me jesus because you know i thought he
is going to return in the rapture and i don't want to be left behind i believe in a literal
book of revelation you know the apocalypse would happen i was trained to expect this guys to part
in the trumpet to sound and yeah i i learned the bible i knew a lot of bible verses i thought i knew
the bible but i knew it in the way that they either skipped over the bad parts glossed over the
bad parts or or excused the bad parts and they trained me to to not be concerned you know he's god
he can do whatever he wants it was a different time moral barometers were different back then and blah
blah and uh i was you know i went to church and i had christian friends i listened to christian music
i worked in christian radio i i was just a it was really the the tapestry that was my entire life
i wasn't a zealot i wasn't to knock on the doors and go spread god's word i wasn't bringing a bible
to public places i wasn't i didn't take mission trips but i was a firm believer in a literal jesus christ
and a literal bible so that's the kind of christian i was did you were broadcasting at the time weren't
you as well for christian radio station yeah that was i started in 1990 worked for k x o j radio in
tulsa oklahoma it's a little hole in the wall i got a job working over nights which is where a lot of
people in broadcasting start you know they put you on the air in the middle of the night so you can kind
of figure it out they can decide if you're any good and so it's kind of the entry door and i graduated
up and then you know it's uh contemporary christian music was really a shoe string operation
back in the early 90s i mean it was unpolished it was there are no budgets but there was a
charm to that i mean in high school i listened to the bands and went to the concerts and the fact that
we were kind of the underdog against the big secular record labels who had all the money there was
something charming about having this niche that belonged to us and so i was uh i bought the concert
tickets and had all the albums and the cassettes and wore the concert t-shirts and and then i translated
that into a career playing christian music on the radio and then the business exploded in the mid 1990s
contemporary christian music became the fastest growing radio format in the country it was just huge
it just really became a big deal and all the major record labels swooped in and they bought up all of
these boutique mom and pop christian labels and they started making everything bigger budgeted and
slicker and you know we see that even today and so i i kind of rode the wave so i went from a fly
by night overnight's disc jockey to morning show co-host for one of the most popular stations in my town
and part of that was that i just sort of rode the wave of the rise of the industry and i was in
christian radio until 2002 i played uh i was on kiss fm pop radio for a couple of years after that
so 14 years and fm radio total do you have any uh do you have any like like you know being on a
being in a christian radio station do you have any like stories like horror stories from like those days or like
um anything that anything like that someone who doesn't know anything about christian radio wouldn't expect from
a christian radio station well i'm trying to think you know it was when we had our we like the
circumstantial stuff you know i remember the first station the first building we had was in a field
there were cows all around and you know so it wouldn't be uncommon for me to be doing uh
you know introducing an album and there's like a cow just outside the window we had a mouse trap in the
transmitter room next to us so we'd be on air doing prayers at night and all of a sudden you'd hear this snap
is this poor mouse was dying its last breath oh no just dumb stuff like that um i
you know they say never meet your heroes there was a sum of that there were some people i met who were in
the christian music industry who were lovely i mean just amazing people and this remains true today
you know we tend to be we speak about people in terms of these blanketed statements about uh
well they're all shills and they're all business people and it's all airbrushed and there's some of that
but you know there's there are a lot of people who sincerely do what they do because they believe
they they 100 and they they love people and they this is what they feel is they're calling
and um you know then there were others either they were burned i'm not going to mention names
but they were just burned out uh the business had made them cynical because it was a business
and they realized how much of it was just money and marketing um there were other people i feel like
who didn't feel like they could make it in mainstream music so they bumped over to christian music
which isn't a niche that they could actually maybe make a living in but they weren't true believers
you know you meet all kinds in the green rooms so kind people rude people generous people divas
i think people are people and in christian circles this is uh you know it's the same in christian music
you find the sincere the insincere the kind the cruel and everybody in between and and that was an eye
opener for me you know to realize that many of the same people that i had seen on the album covers
and had this realized version of who they were and then you meet them and you realize they're just people
for better and worse interesting so how how did so you how did you start the
deconversion experience or the deconstructing experience for you like how how did you go from
being that form of a christian to all the sudden starting to question your faith and deciding to look
more into the evidence for your beliefs you know some people flip that switch quickly it's amazing when
i hear those stories they're like well i was a devout believer and then i encountered this and within
two days i knew it was crap i was not that guy um i think my journey began actually it kind of began
when i my best friend had come out to me as gay it was in the mid 1990s and of course i'd been trained to
feel like gay people were going to hell i made fun of gay people i was you know i was a toxic person
about this thing and and he wrote me a letter and he you know he's just like you you don't know this
about he hit it very well but he said you know i'm gay and you need to know and we didn't speak for
about a year i just uh i you know i couldn't process it and i realized how much i missed the guy
and how he was still a beautiful person and still my best friend and what was i doing
and i reached back out and we reconnected and i think that is the first time i can really remember
deciding i'm gonna cut this out of the bible in my brain i'm gonna take these anti gay verses
all these judgment verses and i'm just gonna say no i'm not gonna do that all right the rest of
the bible is fine but i'm not gonna do that and that's probably the first step and after that there
was the death of a of a christian artist and i was supposed to go on the radio and tell everybody
that god called him home and this horrible accident where his body was mangled you know it made no
sense and even as i was doing the prayers and telling everybody online and you know doing the website
with the tribute talking about how the lord is in control all things work together for good to those
who love him and are called according to his purpose that i was doing the whole time i'm like this crap
this makes no sense to me 9 11 was big for me i remember uh you know that day everybody's
invoking the name of god jerry fall wells blaming gay people you know god's judgment because we've
taken him out of our country and i'm like why this doesn't make any sense and it was those kinds
of things you know it was like a death by a thousand cuts where time and again i was doing a lot of video
production for churches i would go and i would shoot video fundraising videos for churches all around
the country you go to all these different churches and you see the people and you see the problems and
you realize the humanity of it all and and you think no this is not adding up and finally it was
in uh i want to sing i mean i was really going through the journey in 2007 but i stumbled upon a
christopher hitchens debate video i think this was 2008 and uh yeah there's a there's a big problem
i you know i was just working on some graphics listening to stuff in the background uh and i watched
this debate play out and the freaking atheist made a lot of sense and it kind of blew my mind
and lightning didn't come out of the sky and strike him you know god didn't set him on fire and all
and um he really kick started my my journey into questioning so i went back to genesis 11 read the bible
again began to get into the history of religion including other religions and boy at the end of
that journey i just realized as hard as it was and it was very difficult i realized i just didn't buy it
anymore and so it was a long journey you know probably an intense year year and a half but before
that just a lot of little things that were sort of pinging in the back of my brain wow it's uh
it's so it's so interesting how how similar it is to the experience that i had with um
with with two things i the first guest on deep drinks podcast was my dear friend i met in ministry
college who was closeted and gave her 46 years of his life uh 45 or some amount of years of his life
and when australia was voting on the same sex marriage plebiscite i was trying to have conversations
with christians online and he was struggling really bad uh and so we'd meet for coffee and
we'd talk about it and um and i remember thinking like man if the church gets rid of this doctrine
like it did with women having to wear head scarves or or being out or not being able to cut their hair
short or um women not being able to talk in church and things like that if the church just gets rid
of this doctrine in a few years and my friend's wasted his entire life um you know let's let's get
down to the brass tacks and let's actually look at what the bible says and is the bible accurate and
i saw how much it was hurting my friend i'm not living his authentic self and and uh it was for me that
was that was a chink in the arm for me but then also the same thing is uh so you mentioned watching
i think you used in your book you said it was the hitchens versus rabbi bow teeth bow teach
um uh debate and you said um well this will be good uh and then uh oh i found him embarrassing
and that's exactly how i felt with the ken ham versus bill nye debate so i think i i think a friend
of mine a buddy came over and oh and i was a struggling christian not a struggling christian
but i wasn't actively going to church body of mine came over and we're talking about ever
we're having a couple of drinks and we're talking about evolution and i said oh it's just a theory
and he's he said he picked up he's a ph engineer phd he picked up a bottle of water and dropped it
and said so is gravity and i said oh yeah you know but that always stayed in the back of my mind
and uh and then i saw this ken ham versus bill nye debate come up his evolution you know his creation
a bible model for uh and i was like oh this would be good and i remember watching it and just
being like uh oh uh oh uh oh and like by the end uh when they were asking the questions like what
if anything would change your mind i felt so pissed off and heartbroken by the way ken ham responded
and i was just like this is this this doesn't this is dishonest like this is the dishonest way
and that for me started my journey or at least was part of the journey into it it's amazing
how many people i've spoken to on this podcast who have similar experiences with
the debates or just one thing um
like like kind of set some on a certain trajectory and then it's funny about that debate
i think the last questioner in that debate on site was one of my listeners she sent me a
an email and she said look i got tickets and they're gonna pass cards around for q and a
what do you think i ought to ask and i'm like well i can't tell you what
you should ask but if i was there here's what i would ask i would ask what would it take to change
your mind no and that was the last question of the debate and if you recall bill nye said
piece of evidence would cause me to change my mind and ken ham essentially said nothing
would ever change my mind i think that's a great sort of a microcosm of of how we defend
beliefs over knowledge nothing you ever say how many times that we talked to a devout believer
in something and they say i don't care what you ever say i will never change my mind and i think
that's so very talented because the honest answer should be if i'm wrong you know was it the
philosopher bertrand russell who said if the thing is true we should believe it and if it is not
we should not believe i think that's basic yeah but if you're in a culture where beliefs are
defended and not accepted based on the evidence you know the streams get reversed i found that was
a very telling moment of that debate i you've just played you've just played my mind the whole
i did not know that and the whole a question i ask almost every episode is and i'm gonna ask
at the end is what if anything would change your mind and i had no idea that you were in part
responsible well i think i mean somebody else may have duplicated the question yeah it's possible
that you know that someone else ask it but but i i there's a good chance it was a member of the
audience who was who is representing for reason out there so that's so good well if you are if
you're watching this um please and that was you and you did ask the question please let us know
because that is amazing that's to me that that question if that wasn't for that question i might
not be where i am today because that question really really showed the dishonesty in the in the
conversation and to be fair if there are if there are christians who are watching um who don't
want you know who aren't ready to question their faith or anything like that there are ways to um
you don't have to be ken ham or ken tovan there are ways to to i guess uh the right there are
organizations out there who i think are a bit dishonest but but i think if you want to go down
that path who who try to marry up the big bang theory and evolution with the bible um uh so i mean
you can go check those out if that is your thing but um but yeah it just really showed i think it
just really showed how dishonest um ken ham was and another strange coincidence and i and i i feel a
little uh a little sad that that this is the case but um ken ham was actually educated only an
hour away from me in brisbane so i live in the sunshine coast the two universities that he
was educated at was uh down like an hour away from where i'm sitting right now it's like he's a piece
of work isn't he i mean he and the whole organization answers in genesis they're so constantly
tragically wrong you know one of the pieces of ironing i kept thinking about during that debate
with bill nye were now he is the person who believes that the eye is irreducibly complex and
could only have been designed it could not have evolved it is something that you know that god conjured
into existence as this amazing thing and the whole time he's wearing scientifically developed
prescription some prescription eyeglasses for vision correction and the whole time i like
your intelligently designed eyes required a scientific solution so you can frequency your
notes to finish the debate i always thought that was interesting oh i'd never even picked that up
that's that's so amazing if if anyone hasn't watched it uh it just just watch it and just
just just count how many times ken ham actually brings any evidence rather than just defending that
christians can be scientists a scientist can be christian sorry and um there are these people who
did some important things that uh christian and also there's a tack on the christian realm like
ask him for actual actual evidence for a young earth rather than trying to pull apart evolution
or talk about how scientists can be christian too uh yeah cheat you won't you won't get that um
so uh we i'm gonna jump ahead a little bit i want to ask you what do you think is the best
and the worst arguments for the existence of god oh man there are so many um let's let's talk about
because i asked this to um i'm sure you know inspiring philosophy michael jones friend of the show
he comes on and we we get back we we get back we get in the mud and we talk about
we debate over the existence of god and i asked this and the first time he came on what are the
best arguments for the existence of god in your opinion well i mean i haven't heard a lot of good
ones if if there is a good one um you know maybe something to do with um you know the things that
we don't know a god might exist um you know that gets us into the questions of whether or not
that god would even be a benevolent deity and involve their personal deity certainly not
i just i haven't heard i haven't heard great arguments you know mostly i just get a litany of
and i'm not going to give you just one i just get a litany of crap you know uh hitler was an atheist
i hear that one and that's crap that's totally bogus uh he invoked god in mind conf he had god
with us on the nazi belt buckles he claimed that the extermination of the jews was god's good work
you know um uh where do your morals come from you can't have morality without the objective
moral standards i've heard the complexity of the i argument that proves an intelligent designer
the bible is true because there are specific places mentioned in the bible that exist today
um who was it was a matt delahunty who said well that's like saying that the existence of new york
proved spider man you know say it just makes no sense um uh how did something come from nothing
the abiogenesis arguments look at the trees look at the beauty all around this everything
happens for a reason i mean i just i've heard so much crap over the years that it's it's really
hard to to nail down the worst argument in a long litany of bad arguments and i just think
most of the time i hear this it's from some apologist and apologetics by the way
apologist means to speak in defense these are people defending yeah and i look at i think well
what kind of benevolent god would require an apologist in the first place let's say you and i
have questions about all this a benevolent god stops what he's doing parts the skies comes down
and clears it up he doesn't need ken ham doesn't need pastor john hagi or jim jeffris or uh
uh you know it doesn't need any it doesn't need paula why doesn't need donald tron doesn't need any of
these people to tell us what it's i just think a benevolent god would actually come down and solve
things and if you put a hundred apologist in a room and you ask him about the basics ask him about
a literal bible ask him about the holy spirit healing miracles speaking in tongues how to baptize
the rapture whatever you know watch him chew each other to ribbons they can't agree on the basics of
their own faith and i i think that the god he was not the author of confusion has done a terrible
job of not being confusing you know not only that is um no i tweeted this yesterday no apologist
started uh their belief in god for the reasons they now give when defending it do i mean no one
goes like well i looked at the cosmological argument and i i analyzed this so no no they
they often grew up christian or is islamic or muslim sorry or you know and but and they found
there's always problems with their faith so they have to go apologists have to go when i look for
the reasons why it's not bullshit essentially and it's just like i always i'm always interested
when i when i ask a when i ask them an apologist why do you believe they'll give me all these
complicated reasons like that's not why you started believing that they're the defenses for the things
you know that i'm going to bring up that's not why you started believing you started believing for
i'm sure much more mondane reasons you brought up that way or you had an emotional experience or
something you know or or you feel like well it saved you from drugs or something you're right if family
in geography are the two main determiners of someone's belief right i always there's a i think
i've got a five-fold reason that people are staying the faith it's family geography ritual
community and comfort but you know if i had been born in yemen would i have been a protestant christian
almost certainly not right if i had been born in china would i be a protestant christian almost
certainly not and i think that's incredibly telling you can break that down by denomination
uh you know if i'd been born in mexico would i be a pentecostal oh i'd be certainly be a catholic
because that's a catholic culture i was born in one of the northern states more likely episcopal
Lutheran or catholic i mean it's a it really uncanny to see that people are products almost in
almost every case not all of family and culture where were you born what was the religion of your
parents and then you congratulate yourself for beating the odds and being one of the the people
who happen to be born in the right faith i think it's very telling well okay so i'm going to then
throw some some arguments at you then for the evidence for for theism what do you think of
the cosmological argument so whatever begins to exist has a cause of existence the universe began
to exist therefore the universe had a cause of existence well if you go to and we can get into the
kalam cosmological argument as well which is i think what we're doing here yeah everything that
that begins to exist has a cause or creator if you go to the proponent the main proponent of
this argument is apologist william lane craig his website is a freaking nightmare by the way just
not nightmare because i don't know one disagrees that there was a cause for the universe right oh
look something happened there was a singularity and something caused it we do not disagree on this
but the proponents of the kalam cosmological argument make this huge leap by saying that if there was
a cause a first cause with a capital f and a c that has to be an intelligence uh benevolence
being super being divine being it has to be a god and then of course he takes the huge chasm size leap
into the biblical god okay well of course now it has to be ya way well good luck demonstrating that with
kalam so we don't disagree that you know there was a cause something happened i actually i actually
might disagree with that and i might sound really stupid but i i because i had a conversation with some
muslim apologists online and they were saying we have to agree you have to agree that something
started us and i said i don't know if that's even a sensical question i don't even know what do you
mean before like before the big bang like from my understanding time there was no time before there
was no i don't even know if you can ask the question what was before the big bang or like
like what happened in the time before spacetime yeah that really breaks your brain yeah it's like
it gets uh like it gets so complicated that asking like uh you know questions about
first movers or or um something had to have created less i don't even know if that's
or or there has to have to have been a cause i don't know probably is where my brain goes
when i say cause i what i mean is something happened and i don't know what happened they don't
know what happened but you know i i'm just i just don't know if we can i don't even know if that's
even i hear what you're saying but i just don't know if that's you're right it's infinite
rest now are we is it a multiverse right or is there another parallel universe you know what
happened you can lose what i was talking to who was it david mcrainy who was with saying when
you get into this stuff all then you just want to walk into the forest and go carve canoes out of
trees because your your brain cannot take anymore of this type of stuff right so i understand what
you're saying i'm sure yeah uh the fine tuning argument so the universe possesses finally
tune physics constants and initial conditions that allow intelligent life to exist this is due
this is due to necessity change or design it was not due to necessity or chance so well i i think
the fine tuning arguments ridiculous i in fact i'm releasing a podcast just a couple of weeks
with a couple of biologists and uh paleontologists zoologists educators forest valkai and guttsick given
as we talk about you know fine tuning and and essentially it's a creationism argument but if we look
at we look at life around us we don't see fine tuning right the the best most finely tuned
pieces of engineering are distilled down to the simplest forms of what is being engineered we don't see
that we see complexity and we see wildly unnecessary complexity whether it's junk dna and rna you see the fact
that 99.9 percent of all life on this planet has gone extinct you see this planet where what it's 97
percent water uh or 70 water and we can't you know we it's unlabelable to humans 90 plus
percent of the water is undrinkable our sun gives us cancer we we see vestigial bones in
animals that don't need them heavy bones and flying animals wings on flightless birds eyes on
fish that can't see you know this whole idea that everything has sort of been manicured fine
tuned is to me it's it's they're not even trying they see complexity and they conflate complexity
with design things are wildly complex but if if you were an engineer you would not engineer them
this way there's a great book by a biologist evolutionary biologist dr abbey hafer and it's
called the not so intelligent designer she goes hard into many of the intelligently designed things
that are actual total crap and an engineer designer would never do it this way and here's why
uh it's yeah it's uh i remember i think it was steven hawking who said if the universe is primed
for anything it's the existence of black holes like if it's if it's designed for anything and which
are the most destructive things okay so that so what was that book called sorry the um
the unintelligent designer is that right it's called the not so intelligent designer dr abbey hafer
i've had her on the show a couple of times and she's just she's a killer abbey she just she's in
and she's like well this this stupid and this is you know why would god make the the same canal
that we use to excrete feces and urine why would he use all of that stuff for our sex like why
would you make the water slide in the sewer pipe the same thing why in the world would you put the
esophagus and you know the wind pipe next to each other so there were hundreds and hundreds of
choking deaths every single year you know why would you put this why would you do that and she's got
a great point and then she points to other creatures in nature that actually have a better
design you know there are tons of animals in the animal kingdom beside the human animal to have
much better eyes than we do our eyes are not great and they require constant correction by
scientists and why would that be if we were finely tuned and intelligently designed there's a
great many of those examples wisdom teeth and the appendix and all those types i like it's excuse
my christness but um i think ricky jeves says um if god heads gay sex so much why would you
why would you put the male g-spot up the the asafiyam you know it's i haven't heard that buddy but it
does sound like derby something yeah sorry to me it's too early in the morning for me for those
jokes i felt a little cringy now but you know i am pretty crass myself so um what i want to do
is i want to jump into talking a little bit about purity culture if you're okay with that yeah but
first i want to shout out your podcast could you maybe talk to us about your new podcast you've
got coming up yeah i've got two i started the thinking atheist podcast based on the website in
2010 again the thinking atheist is not a person it is an icon and then i um uh have uh you know all
of my video content and podcast and whatnot there it's kind of a hub there are resources you
can go and link there for books and and uh other free thought websites i need to update the website
i'm kind of a one-man show but the thinking atheist dot com i thought about whether or not i should
change it because you know atheism really is a statement about the gods i don't believe in
i really these days have led more with humanist but i found that people who are on a journey will
google the word atheist and they will find this community and and so for that reason i've decided
to stick with it so it's the thinking atheist dot com or you can search for the podcast on all
major podcast apps and i i just launched in august a brand new show because you know i was looking
for a fresh challenge because i'm a storyteller because i was a fan of a classic broadcaster his name
was paul harvey i wasn't a fan of his politics but he was one of the greatest storytellers ever
and he had a weekly or not weekly at a every weekday daily a feature ran about four minutes long
it was called the rest of the story and he would tell a true story with kind of a kicker or a surprise
at the end and he passed away you know years ago and i haven't been able to find anybody who
does what he did and so i've sort of taken up that mantle obviously i'm not trying to be paul harvey
i'm me i've got my own style but true stories we're talking about five minute vignettes it can be
ancient history it could have been something wild and interesting that happened last week and
be celebrity news true crime weird news you know stories of the strange and um they're just fun
and they're five minutes and they release every monday wednesday and friday so it's not like it's a
big time commitment it's a little sound bite you can just jump in get your nugget of whatever
happened uh leave with a smile and get on with your day and if you uh want to subscribe it's on all
the major podcast apps true stories with sef andrews or just go to the website true stories podcast
dot com awesome awesome they're fun and of they they it looks it looks fun because i i want to
jump into this and have a few we listen i can imagine in the future you might get some people
like animating some of the stories i can i can see that because it's so i'm short and it'd be
interesting i haven't i haven't checked it out um but i'm i'm looking forward to it's hard i think
especially for content producers we're so busy making stuff people will often ask me what do you
listen to and i do listen a lot to a lot of audiobooks a few podcasts here and there but
mostly i find myself producing stuff so it's hard to carve out you know if someone's like hey take
three hours and listen to this long form show i'm like who's got three hours who's got 30 minutes
so i you know don't feel obligated to do that but i do and i also know that
there's a squillion podcast out there but i i have yet to find anybody who's doing it this way
and you know i i can't do a lot of stuff well but i feel like i'm i'm a pretty good storyteller
and so i've gotten good feedback and it's getting noticed and you know i think people have a good time with
i i think anyone i think people could listen to you read a um a manual for like a vcr or something
because your voice is just and uh of course um the the we want to talk about purity culture so
just so everyone is aware i recently picked up deconverted because os who i'm sure you know os from
tang he's been on this show before and he said he was going through you know the books that helped him
with his deconversion process for me it was um the biggest one was god is not great like chris
fitchens that to me to me i read that every now and again and it makes me there's something about
that the poetry of how he talks and stuff um was and and and os also like that book um of of
course like the god delusion and you know all the classics but one i hadn't i hadn't read was yours
and and there was the one that he said was by far the most impactful for him in his journey
wow and i was like i've got to check out this book so i listened to uh deconverted in the midst
of the christmas chaos so the first half of it is in my mind marred with the christmas chaos of a
family drama at the time but the second half of it um book was fantastic and i was like okay that
book was really good i really enjoyed it so i decided i think yesterday to start on uh christianly
made me talk like an idiot oh no it's just not yesterday the day before um i finished it in one
day it was it was to me christiany made me talking about the idiot which is your newest book was
amazing uh it was it was exactly it met me exactly where i where i was um in where my journey
was it's just it's funny it's interesting it's i love it so but there was a part of this this book
and everyone the links in the description if you want to go listen to this or read it um and
using the link will help this channel out as well but the um there is a section in this book
that i'm really thankful that you went into which is the chapter 10 the chapter on purity culture
and i was wondering if we could have a look at that together yeah absolutely uh so um let me just
pull it up um so i don't know i'm going to get a physical version do you have a
the ability to get signed copies or anything i need to get a signed copy from you one day maybe
when i come over to the states yeah i mean uh when we're down with the show just drop me a message
and i'll i'll just send you one yeah awesome let me Merry Christmas or last month so oh thank you
so much wow allow me to bless you in the lord with a thank you of my yeah brother that would be
that would be awesome uh so you mentioned um you mentioned you have this whole um topic about
purity culture could you quickly just give us a rundown about what what the purity culture was
like when you grew up you mentioned and just to just so i don't cut you off because i have a tendency
of doing that you mentioned um uh masturbation clubs essentially where people would hold each
other accountable i've talked about that a lot on this channel i i used to run those clubs i used
to be part of those clubs and it was so funny to have you know a bunch of us teenage men would
get together and be like we need to pray away this temptation to masturbate and to look at women
and then by sunday when sunday sunday would come around everyone we messaged each other pray pray pray pray
pray pray pray pray pray because it's been a week since anyone's you know even thought about a
lossful thing and everyone is running out to the bush to pray by themselves for the for ben who's
struggling and then ben is praying for danie and danie like it's just it's all we're all yeah so very
much related to it but anyway tell us about how what purity culture was like for you uh in the church
well that's actually you know it's funny that's the topic of the speech i'm giving you
and it will eventually when i retire it from the road it'll go on youtube that talks about
a lot of this stuff but purity culture is usually fundy religion based most often christianity
in islam it is a culture that is an abstinence culture save yourself until marriage because
marriage is a sacred thing you will consecrate yourself before your spouse and god and it's just
a nightmare because you know we figure the median age for puberty is maybe 12 and the average age
for marriage in this country being 29 i think so you think about all those years in between would be
premarital sex your sexually activated self is raging you're a hormonal young person and you
the attraction mechanisms are going full kick and then you have an entire culture of people saying
you're unnatural you're lustful you're sinful you're carnal pray it all away kind of thing and if you can't
wait there's actually an instruction in the bible that says it's better for you to marry than to burn
with lust so then you see people who you know they leap into marriage well before they're ready
because they don't want to be an adulterer you see promises given to god this was true in our school
they had a true love waits program or an abstinence program the girls would actually be given rings to
put on their wedding ring finger and there'd be a prayer that said i promise not to have sex with anyone
until i get married and of course they're just rigged for failure if they had had sex they were sort
of ruined or deflowered or whatever then they would have to come back and throw themselves at the mercy of
the church and they would be deemed what they called new virgins were the lord even though physically
they weren't a virgin god it cleansed their heart you know we saw boys brought in and they would
be told you know keep it in your pants cross your legs that was sort of their solution good luck with
that women though were mostly sort of anointed or anointed they were targeted as the gatekeepers
for sexual purity don't be a harlot don't show too much skin don't tempt the men don't be a jazabelle
and so the thinking was my wife just texted me and said i had one of those rings she must be
the thinking was that you know even if a man if even if he lusts it's the woman's fault right i mean
she's lustful she is an object of lust and boy this is right out of the bible right eve
tempted adam she was responsible for that forbidden fruit and how did god punish her he punished her
sexually he said you will have pain and childbirth and your desire will be for your husband and he will
rule over you meaning that her attraction to her husband was part of a curse handed down by god and we
see this throughout the bible women are blamed for the bad shit that men do you know and so it's a
whole culture of dysfunction they set you up for failure then you know there might be church discipline
involved if you fail in your faith you fail in your carnality you're brought before people and you
have to apologize to the church the masturbation partner thing was a story that a friend of mine
brought where the pastor wanted the men to have an accountability partner so if they felt the need
to self pleasure they're supposed to call a body say pray with me and that's supposed to produce a cold
shower effect and now you look back on it you think this is so offensively inappropriate you know
the permissions that the religion and the church elders and the parents and the pundits and the pastors
you know the congregants the permission they gave themselves to appear in everybody's window
and pass judgment upon them is just astounding and as i say in the book and i say in the speech
that's coming up why would we ever take sex advice from the bible the bible got everything else wrong
right cosmology and meteorology and it got history wrong and morality you know it's got everything
prophecy the bible is historically wrong about everything why in the world will we take the
bible's advice on anything yeah and so yeah it was it was pretty rough growing up you know you
was a constant repent and sin repent sin and repent sin and repent thing where you know you do
what you feel natural you would feel these feelings of attraction and even lust you would find
yourself you know in a dark space with your partner doing all kinds of things and then when it was
over and and the heat of the moment waned you thought jesus just saw that and you dropped your
knees and say please forgive me i won't do it again and then two days later you did it again
and this is the cycle many people never get out of it's uh yeah and and this is this is why
this is so important um so for those who don't know um deep drinks this year is moving into panels
as well so we're doing deep drinks panels and one of the first we'll be doing is a panel
i'm about to have a baby um my wife and i have our first baby through rvf so it's going to be a bit
touch and go until we get the panels ready uh obviously with i'm not going to do it right around
baby time because i don't know how okay i'd like that's going to be but when we do get the panels up
and going i'll we're doing one on purity culture and one of the guests that will be on the panel is
one of the youth that was in the these masturbation purity clubs when i was the youth pastor uh and
he's going to share part of his journey in that and um so when hearing about what you what you're
what you've said in your book like to me it is so important because uh i remember talking to recently
i've spoken a lot to secular friends about you know for the first time you had i guess mutual
sex with someone or you hooked up with someone or things like that you think what you do in your
teenage years um i would ask them you know did you feel guilt or shame afterwards and they're like
what like no what are you talking like what are you what are you talking about and for me i always
did i always every time every time i would express my sexuality with someone or i would kiss someone
who i wasn't dating or something like that like i would feel this tremendous amount of guilt and
shame and not not only that but that actually extended right into my marriage so my wife and i
who's watching at the moment we waited till we were married to have sex we did other stuff and
we're pretty good at it but when we uh when we actually had sex for the first time was on our
wedding night and that the even even even to this day i still sometimes get anxiety around having
sex so before having sex or sometimes getting anxiety or afterwards i'll feel guilty or anxious
or or shameful and it's like one out of ten times when i first got married that i wouldn't feel
these horrible feelings associated with sex and it all comes back to the purity culture and the
the the stuff that i was taught in church about um i love what heathen queen says who i've seen this
morning has just been um uh canceled on twitter or her account's been suspended but she said um
not giving into the desires of your body not uh not um not respecting the desires of your body
and i was like that just rung so true to me uh not honoring the needs of your body sorry is the
is the phrase i'm rambling a little bit sorry well you know there's a dark side to that too
uh another dark side i've heard a lot of stories from people who
they actually waited they they made it they did everything but sex until they got married and then
the first time they had sex was on their honeymoon night and it was horrible is terrible
no one knew what to do they knew nothing about their body or their partner's body they didn't even
know if they were physically compatible which is a massive part of the compatibility question
and it was terrible and they wrestled with shame and all that baggage that the church had
saddled them with and many people carry it for for a long long time they end up maybe
is trapped in a marriage that the contracts already signed they realized too late that we
aren't compatible in this very important way it's just terrible and beyond that i have discovered
that the church knows that if it can control your sexuality it has all of you so because you
know who you are as a sexual creature relates to so much of your life who you're attracted to who
your partners are how you define family you know how you live and if they can get your
sexuality they can stamp a brand of control and ownership on that they've got you and it's an
amazing moment of liberation when you can say no no no you don't get the key to my private space
you don't get to tell me what i do or how i do it and i do not give you permission that's a moment
at real liberation it's sometimes very difficult to get there but it's important that people do get
there because once you're able to do that your whole world opens up and i think that's when real
healing and liberation can begin yeah for sure i'm so glad that my partner and i didn't have that
problem with um with uh not being sexually compatible um we just luck of the draw but i know i know
so many people who yeah it must be so hard for them to end up in the bedroom not know what to do
and then hate it like that would be a nightmare and what a horrible way to start a marriage so you give
these uh one two three four five six six pieces of advice that you would give to your younger self
and i was wondering if we could quickly um just go through each step uh so i'll read just a little
bit of the first part you say ignore the bible and you said if you pardon my expression krishnaj knows
fuck all about sex the bible's authors were constantly on the wrong side of cosmology geology
meteorology history and almost everything else addressed in its truths yeah i i would agree with
the same bible that said that you know that um uh had you know would banish women when they were on
their period they banish them from town for a week you know this was the bible's great wisdom
the same um bible that uh christian tradition that had lileth who was apparently allegedly according
to babelonian mythology and some christian traditions the first wife of adam who was a sexually
liberated woman she even wanted to be on top you know she demanded equality well she wasn't gonna
work out so she gets excised you know they kick her out of the garden and she's demonic and she
goes off to do demonic things so eve can come in and submit and be the good girl kind of deal
you know and you think about the bible talks about how jesus was conceived essentially via ghost
sex it was mary asked for consent no god said oh good for you you're about to be the mother of a
child and then the holy spirit impregnates her i mean sex throughout the bible is so freaking dysfunctional
so yeah don't take sex advice from the bible these people knew nothing about anything they were mostly
a bunch of sexist dudes who uh who considered women property in the spoils of war anyway you
know throw it away you don't need it yeah and women will be saved through childbearing that's the
way as a scripture i never hear many people talk about in the new testament do solo runs
thou shall not masturbate i would wage that many of those primates are quite like
are quite likely spanking their own monkey self pleasure is simply pleasure yeah we were warned
you know you're gonna go blind you're gonna grow hair on your palms
there those are there oh they're almost tropes where they would say you're gonna grow hair on your
palms if you masturbate or you may go blind and of course these were things they would use to try
to scare young people into not self-pleasuring and of course you're still trying to discover
what's going on my body's in flux everything is on fire you know it's everything and
and they've set you up so that even in your private space the eye in the sky is always watching
and so i thought you know after the fact
you know self pleasure is simply pleasure i think the statistic is around 90 of men and i think
75% of women adult women or women men and female men and women over the age of 14 i believe
masturbate and it's you know it's a subject that makes a lot of people blush helps sometimes it
makes me blush i'm a shy person in that way but you know this whole idea that the church has
given itself permission to your private space and that somehow you're ruining yourself with
carnality and lust and sin and you've betrayed your future spouse blah blah it's just a bunch of crap
you know it is it's okay every but almost everybody does it you're not ruining yourself
and i think we have to get over this sort of prudishness and more importantly this attitude
that someone else is watching or that if i don't do it their way i am damaged goods we have to
get get rid of that and enjoy sex for what it is and sex comes in a great many forms it's part of
the human experience and it's beautiful yes this one you said i can hear the religious berserk losing
the berserk is losing the shit over this one have premarital sex yeah yeah a back a background
of sexual experience doesn't make you an adulterer nor is it the church's business learn to protect
yourself emotionally and physically and there is as a responsible and liberator person enjoy what you
enjoy and i love that i think it's important to protect yourself emotionally and physically
obviously it's uh you know there's stis and and there's way you know you might not be ready to
have sex that's totally fine and you can you can never have sex if you don't want to but if you
want to have sex and you meet someone who else who else wants to have sex great there's no downside
you know if you if you're if you're enthusiastically consenting of legal age or whatever
i don't care i mean i this whole idea that who told you not to do it in the first place
and it's that we always end up coming back to the same bible misogynists who were trying to
control people especially women and i think about all the time and all the years wasted
that people should have been exploring and learning and being human beings
get educated learn what sex is how does it work what's happening in your body what's happening in
their bodies how does it all play out and then and then go on a journey with it and you know as
long as everybody is being safe and responsible and everybody is enthusiastically consenting i think
you know be you do you anyway that you you feel fulfilled and good for you
that's that's great and this is a big one live with someone before marrying them oh yeah
yeah tell us a bit about that when i was growing up if you live with someone before you got married
we called it shacking up or living in sin and some people still call it that right ah you're not
married didn't sign on the the dotted line they're living in thin well i don't think you can really
know someone unless you live with them yeah especially in there was a chemical change that
happens when we are infatuated there is we are literally chemically high on someone which is why
you'll meet people who have been dating for six nine months and they're like oh we never argue and
they're the most perfect person in the world and it's just so amazing but you're high you are
literally chemically high on that person and it often takes 12 to 18 months for the amygdala to
reactivate and for that chemical imbalance to sort of measure out where you start to see people
not through the rosy glasses and i think if you live in the same space you get to see each other
they get to see each other at your best and your worst you get to see each other when you're cranky
when you have the flu you get to see each other when things are not great you know you really get to
peel back the onion and that is when you can make an informed decision beyond that i really think
that a lot of people who live together aren't considered legitimate families because they haven't
stood in front of a judge or a priest and signed a piece of paper and i think that's a bunch of crap
i think family comes in a great many forms you don't have to have a piece of paper to be family so
live in the same space and build your family the way you want to on your terms and if it's a marriage
or something else makes no difference you're still a family and i think those are totally legitimate
yeah awesome and the last one uh have fun with it by nature i have been i have never been very adventurous
but i have come to realize how much time and energy i once wasted judging those who are and i can i can
totally relate to not to the to judging those who are adventurous but to um to for me i spent so much
energy trying not to uh i guess have fun trying to resist the urge to have fun uh in my life
especially my teen years and it's exhausting and i love that you just end with simply have fun with it
it's amazing how often we looked down our noses that people who did things that we considered to be
too different or you know they were too different you know they didn't validate us in that way
how much time and energy had i wasted judging people and now i you know not spending all my time
looking down my nose and seeing the different as aberrant but just part of the wide spectrum of
the human experience i'm amazed at how it's opened up my life i mean i've been introduced to so much
more beauty and diversity and and how it's enriched me in ways that i never once thought possible
and uh you know yeah i'm i'm a conservative person personally not politically but i mean i i'm
that guy you know i my idea of a wild night is to mix in some regular coffee with the decaf that's
my idea of being wild i'm just that guy you know i i love people but i'm really kind of an
introvert um and i'm not adventurous really in any way and that's just that's just how i am
but you know where i used to look at people who would experiment and do a lot of
this you know stuff that was sort of out of the box i would be like wow that's freaky that's
bizarre that that's aberrant that's perverse and now i think good for you you know if if you want
to do whatever as long as you all are enthusiastically consenting whatever your kink or thing is
and knock yourself out you know life short go and be happy and have fun with it and to be able to do
and feel and say that out loud is liberating it's just so amazingly free that's judgment i don't
have to carry around anymore and it opens me up to people and the diversity of people that i had
once rejected and my life's better now that my tent has expanded in that way
yeah i i i yeah i agree i agree with everything you've said in that chapter of the book at some
i i encourage everyone to go read christian lee may we talk like an idiot i uh we're coming up
to the end of the show i do have some questions but i would be totally totally ashamed or i don't
know what the word is but i i need to show you something so last night my beautiful wife and i
watched your your talk on the satanic panic which is a fantastic video just type in satanic panic
seth Andrew's amazing talk that you gave at a conference about the satanic panic of the 80s
i remember this a year ago or something and it reminded me of something that my mother was obsessed
with uh and uh not what not this is not wrong where she she had a few and she liked them that were
cool and i decided to start a collection and i thought you could maybe uh comment on this
collection so i ordered them online and the the place that i ordered them from they paid for
half of the postage because they believe that i was doing it as some form of ministry so you
mentioned this in your um do you know what i'm talking about you mentioned this as part of your
satanic panic but so i i've got a huge box here of these i'm trying to see here hang on
are those religious tracks oh shit tracks i've got a whole collection there is hundreds
of these different books that'll tell you different ways that the um the the world is poison
somebody loves me um this is a famous one this thing this was the first one this was your life
the little little things that people put even still today i've see people in australia
handing them out on halloween uh down at the gold coast yeah for those not familiar a
chicken tracks are a series of tiny comic books that were invented by a guy named jack chick
he's dead now but he had these things printed as kind of a ministry and i mean they've been
printed by the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions i mean i can't i can't
believe how many have been made and i think they're made even today of course um and they would be
left on doorsteps and put in trick-or-treat bags and put under windshield wipers and it's all fear porn
you know you don't want to go to hell and burn forever and the devil is waiting in the bush and
and dungeons and dragons will make you become possessed with demons and it's just horrifying stuff much
of it targeted the young children and so yeah chick tracks are just insidious horrible things and in fact i
think you can see a bunch of them online just google chick tracks and look at some of the offensive
stuff that they hand out to kids it'll blow your mind blow your mind yeah and they some of them some of
them are actually rare collect items now because they they went out of print because the doctrine was too
fucked up um but it's it's funny they thought they they so they went halves in the postage for me which
was like 40 us dollars um because they were like oh we want us you know this is part of the ministry
where we pay for people's postage internationally i'm like okay great it's really a weak kind of
evangelism too i think it's you know instead of engaging somebody one on one instead of going out
and doing the hard work of proselytizing as a minister of the gospel instead you just take this and
stick it in somebody's uh in the door and you get to go home and pat yourself on the back and say
i have done god's good work today i mean it's really a kind of theological masturbation i think i
think you are you're you've told yourself that you've done something of substance and the truth is
your your lazy ass stuck a piece of paper in somebody's door and you walked off you haven't done
anything i find that yeah yeah so i just i love this and i was like i've got to start a collection
this is just this is this will one day not be around and i just it's it's a blast from the past so
so let's jump into some q and a uh i have a few questions let's get through them uh i'll try and get
through as many as possible before we run out of time i'm trying to make the answer short for you so
so what advice would you give to someone who's questioning their faith and i was hoping you could
answer both intellectually and how to process it emotionally i would say first of all you have to
frame it this way any worthy god would never punish questions and would never punish you
for trying to live an honest life a worthy god would never threaten you would never say
the doubt is a sin which he does in the bible that god would never threaten hell for non-compliance
a worthy god would say you're doing your best trying to figure it out i respect that and i think
you start there then i think you have to get into the man-made nature of religions dissect it
understand how it was made who voted the books of the bible in why they disagree why they make
no sense in this way you know i i think it's okay emotionally i think you're gonna drag behind
yourself intellectually when i was working through it logically i knew in my mind this wasn't
washing but emotionally i was behind because i'm like oh my god i don't want to go to hell what happens
if i'm wrong that's natural allow that to happen if you move your mind forward and ask the questions
your heart i believe will follow it takes a while i think you surround yourself with other people
who are also questioners who are curious who are critical and unafraid to be so and give yourself
time and grace don't punish yourself if you don't know say i don't know and um you know just take it
one day at a time you know take a deep breath move forward commit yourself to trying to figure it out
and i make the same commitment that i think anybody should make if there is evidence for a god somewhere
that i discover tomorrow i would want to know that that's what an honest life looks like and i think
that's the goal awesome that's great advice what advice would you give to someone who is maybe has
maybe crossed that line they know can now now no longer consider themselves a christian a muslim a hindu
and they want to come out to their friends and family as a non-believer well i think there's a cost
benefit that only the individual can navigate you have to determine what you are willing to endure
and i think it's situational it's going to be different for everybody someone may come out to a
religious family member and they kind of raise an eyebrow but it's not a big deal somebody else may
come out to a religious family member and it means that they ignite the whirlwind or ignite ignite the
wild i don't know i got my metaphors confused yeah yeah um and it's it's crazy you know things get awful
so everybody's going to have to determine what's the cost benefit for me but frame it like this
your journey belongs to you you don't owe anybody else anything you are not on this planet to keep
other people comfortable trust me they're not mitigating their value system or opinion for you
why in the world would you participate in a double standard where you're the one sitting on your hands
to keep them happy that's not life that's not a fulfilled authentic life and i wish for you an
authentic life will you lose some people if you live authentically and they know it yeah but that says
more about them than it says about you right it it says that their love was always conditional
it says that they are willing to cut a cord with you because you do not validate them that tells you
something about them and that's their fault not yours life is short and i think you deserve
the gift a gift you can give yourself every day an authentic life so no matter how difficult it may be
that's my hope and my dream for you is you can get to that point where you can be loud and proud
be you on your terms without apology wow that's really good um yeah that's really good
i'm going to skip a couple questions for the sake of time um what i'll go to the last two
questions i always ask us um usually ask us uh depending if it's appropriate or not
what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in
plausibly plausibly true i'll tell you this you know it was it uh robert macnamara who said
don't answer the question you were asked answer the question that you wish was asked so i may be
doing that here i hope yeah yeah yeah if i was anything i would probably be a buddhist i know that
there buddhism is there's so many different shades of it but there is a non-theistic buddhism there's
sort of a non-spiritual buddhism which is more of a philosophy of peace and whatnot and don't
don't come after me because i know there is there are shades of buddhism that are not peaceful but
but overall if i had to pick one area yeah i i kind of like the kindness uh you know the
mindfulness thing yeah living in the moment of you know centering yourself buddhist in that way i mean
that's probably probably my favorite if i had to pick yeah i uh it's funny most people choose buddhism
it's funny even the christians have had on okay and the last question which
is i guess this is all come full circle what if anything would change your mind well i think that
answer is has a the question is a two-fold answer the first is bill nye's answer you know give me some
give me a good piece of evidence give me some reasons to change my mind and i think that's great
i mean that that you're not defending a belief in that point because you need to defend the belief
like you would defend like a child from danger you know you are honestly saying well whatever is true
let's figure that out so i think to change my mind on something i would need evidence and people
will sometimes say to me well seth will never change his mind on atheism and i'm like you are
talking to someone who's changed his mind about almost everything that he wants to believe so to tell
me that i'm not capable of change or changing my mind is just a cop out and it's stupid on the issue
of god specifically a benevolent god i'm asked the question what would it take for you to believe
in god and i used to give the same answer well a good piece of evidence but i kind of like the
answer that matt de la hunti gave if you believe in an omnipotent god i wouldn't even need to know
what it would take to change my mind because god would know an omnipotent omniscient god would
know exactly what it would take to convince me and he would have already done it that's a great
answer so you know if there is a benevolent all powerful all knowing deity you already know exactly
what that would take and he would have already done it i think that's my favorite answer so far
wow that's that's that's fantastic that's it that's a good answer i i remember getting stopped
in the street by a street preacher asked me what would change my mind about the evidence
and i wish i thought of this at the time but i thought of it later on which is for me to believe
in the god the god of the bible as a literal like you take the bible literally it would take the same
thing for me that i'm that i went oh my gosh i'm jumping on words it would be the same evidence i
need to believe in a married bachelor that is the god of the bible is so whatever whatever would
require me to believe in a married bachelor it would be the same evidence i need to believe in the god
of the bible now that opens up a whole other thing because now all right let's say that i believe
in a god all right well now i believe that now there is a god and you've shown me the evidence or
whatever that still doesn't answer the question of whether that god is benevolent what if it's a malevolent
nasty mischievous sadistic god would that god deserve worship i mean there are a whole other
series of questions that would come after an acceptance of the data that proved a god you know there's a
whole rabbit's hole that you could fall down into after that some some of the earliest christians
believe that of the old testament god they believe that jesus was a deity that came to save us from the
malevolent god of the old testament let me should reject the old testament um mars yun of sunope
was the teacher of that um i think mars yunites anyway um i digress thank you so much seth for coming
on deep drink podcast it's been an absolute pleasure make sure everyone to go check out links to
the books in the description and the podcasts and thinking atheists and true stories with seth andrews
next week we have um holy cool aid on thomas westbrook to talk about miracles does god heal amputees this
will be a really fun episode although it's it's on the same day that our due date is for our baby
so it might cancel please bear with me that's uh as we have a baby um thank you so much seth for
coming on it's been an absolute pleasure is there any last things you'd like to say to the audience before
we leave no i mean just thanks for letting me sit and play in the sandbox with you congratulations
on the upcoming birth of your child and i think if i was to reiterate anything it's is that people deserve
an authentic life families like to blackmail family members and say this is not how we raised
you or you're embarrassing us or those types of things but you know we are here on this planet
for a finite time i think you deserve authenticity and there's a a real joy in freedom despite the
outward conflicts and all the junk that people throw at you and the challenges you might have with
the boss i mean all those things are real but in here in your heart in your mind in your in your
person there's no gift you can give yourself like living authentically it's just it is the most
amazing thing about leading superstition it's a gift that i feel like i get to give to myself every
single day i wouldn't trade it people ask would you ever go back to religion i say no no i'm better
now i'm more centered i'm not in conflict i don't live in shame i get to be curious i get to discover
the world i get to learn new stuff all the time i mean it's just i feel more alive than i ever have
and that's i think my hope and my dream for everybody else be authentic take the journey live
the moments because there may be no tomorrow that's awesome thank you so much everyone will see
next week and love you all goodbye
