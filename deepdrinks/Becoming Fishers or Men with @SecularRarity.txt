You're casting your net in the wrong place, David, and that's what you need to do.
I remember being a kid, myself and my mum were going to go fishing.
We were going to go fishing, and I remember seeing a cartoon, there was a fish on the cartoon,
and I said, mum, this must mean we're going to get a fish today.
I was like, that's evidence that we're going to get a fish, and I don't think we did get a fish.
But it didn't matter because even if you didn't get a fish, David, what that was was actually
God sending you that message so that you could have the disappointment to recognize that what
you needed to do was actually rely on God and not on your own understanding.
See, you thought you could go fish by yourself, but in reality, only God can truly fish.
Yeah, or, well, you know, God was trying to teach me at that young age that I needed to be a fisher of men.
A fisher of men, yes!
