living to sin is a weird thing because it's much easier to be
sinful within religion, which encourages hypocrisy. It's easier
to do whatever you want and then get forgiveness not from the
victims of your quote unquote sins, but from a guy who I've
decided I've decided the I the person you didn't manipulate or
abuse or do whatever to I've decided I can forgive you
