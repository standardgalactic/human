Given into the New Testament, Judas being on a disciple of Jesus,
falling him around, seeing these things firsthand,
and still choosing to betray him in the greatest way possible,
not just apathy or agnosticism,
betraying the Savior of the world, the Son of God,
like you cannot make the excuse any longer
that evidence of God takes away our free will.
