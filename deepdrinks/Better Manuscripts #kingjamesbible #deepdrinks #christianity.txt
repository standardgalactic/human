Absolutely, we have better manuscripts, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. There were a number of discoveries that were made of more ancient and more reliable manuscripts and also manuscripts that we had known about, but had been lost or had not been made widely available, became available.
Icanus is one of those very early important manuscripts of the whole Bible that was limited to people who had access to the Vatican Library, but that was made public, I think, in either the 19th or the 20th century.
And we discovered a ton more. We discovered Sinaiticus, one of the most important manuscripts in St. Catherine's monastery on the top of Sinai.
