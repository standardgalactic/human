I was wondering if you could give me, like, how historical they are.
King David.
I'd say 50% then.
Moses.
Maybe 10%.
I mean, like, was there a guy named Moses?
Maybe.
I mean, but...
Abraham.
One percent.
Like, was there a guy named Abraham?
Maybe.
But I mean, like, none of the stories reflect reality.
That's obviously going to be some news for three major religions or more.
