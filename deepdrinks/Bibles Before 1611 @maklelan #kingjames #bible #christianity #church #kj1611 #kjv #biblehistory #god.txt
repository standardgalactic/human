Well, the average person was never going to be able to afford a Bible because of how much work it
was to produce it. Prior to the printing press, it was just obscenely expensive. But the church had
also, since the Reformation, tried to put a stop to what they called vernacular translations of the
Bible. So translations into local languages and English was considered one of these vernaculars.
And so, yeah, usually the only time they heard the text was during some kind of liturgical reading
when it was being read publicly in a church or when they were getting passages recited to them
by the clergy, the priesthood. So it was not something that someone sat down in the evening
and read right before rolling over and going to bed.
