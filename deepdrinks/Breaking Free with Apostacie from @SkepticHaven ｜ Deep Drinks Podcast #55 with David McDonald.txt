Today, my guest is Stacey who goes by Apostasy Online. She is a formal evangelical turned secular activist.
She is the co-host of Secular Soapbox and her story is one of pursuing goodness and honest reflection.
You can check out Secular Soapbox every Wednesday 5pm at Pacific Standard Time.
Stacey and I actually share many things in common. We both come from Pentecostal Christianity.
We both experience the trauma that that can bring. We're negatively affected by purity culture and we both have amazing partners
who dealt with us through the journey that we took them on through theological changes in our perspectives and the emotions that comes with that.
Stacey spent a lot of her life seeking perfection, protecting her purity and looking for demons around every corner.
Stacey comes across as a very genuine person. It's easy to see as soon as you talk with her and that's why I've invited her on the show.
Welcome Stacey, my new friend.
Aw, thank you. Thanks for having me.
Well, thank you for having me on your show. So that's something we should probably mention straight off the bat.
Oh yeah!
I was on your show and it was just such a great time.
Sorry, I'm getting a bit of feedback. Oh my gosh.
That's okay. Is it me?
No, no, it was me. Sorry, it was the... I was just trying to... the episode started playing in like another tab and I'm like, which tab is it?
Oh, that happens on YouTube, yeah.
So, yeah, we had a really good episode on... let me just... oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh, this is going fantastic so far. Sorry guys, I accidentally shared the wrong thing and blah blah blah.
So we had a really good episode on your channel and we kept talking about ages.
We kept talking about the conversation over in Deep Drinks. But yeah, if anyone wants to go check out that, you can go over to Skeptic Haven and check out Secular Soapbox.
And it was a really good time, yeah.
So, Stacey, I have a question.
It was a really nice time.
Oh, yes, okay. So, it's not that exciting. I'm sure you've drank this before with other guests, but it's just... I got mine from Starbucks. It's a nice coffee today.
Yay, I got my own coffee.
Yeah, yay. I was hoping... pardon?
I'm so thankful. I feel like...
I was hoping to have something... oh yes.
Because it's 7 a.m. for you, right?
Yeah, well, it's 1 o'clock in the afternoon for me.
Oh, 6?
Yeah, yeah. So, it was so funny. We were messaging back last night. We were messaging and I was like, oh my gosh, I've got to go to bed.
I've got to be up in three hours to get to the end of Deep Drinks.
So, this is going to be really good. I'm really excited to get into your journey because it seems we share a lot in common,
especially the way you talk about your partner and the way I talk about my partner, Amy. It's just so many parallels.
I often describe Amy as like the rock and I'm like this balloon that's like flying around on the top and she's like holding me
because I've just been all over the place and Amy doesn't really care.
Like, I guess, so much about the...
Yeah, yeah. And I heard that, I heard Brian is a, he tweets a lot, so I followed him on Twitter as well.
Oh, good.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that's awesome.
So, I have the first question I want to ask you before we jump into your story is, if you give one word to describe your deconstructing, what would that word be?
Oh, well, right away, the first word that comes to mind is very freeing.
Yeah.
The amount of freedom I felt immediately was like nothing I'd ever experienced. So, yeah, I'd say it was freeing.
Did you have, did you experience like a mix of like positive and negative emotions?
I think I had more positive emotions for someone who was as devoted as I was how it was Christianity was my entire identity.
You know how they say like your identity is in Christ, I had to be my entire identity.
For someone who embodied that, it sounds so strange that I would be so happy as soon as I left that life.
It was just, I felt euphoric. I felt like I was just like I had this whole realization that I could choose.
When I stopped believing, as soon as I stopped believing, it was like everything made sense.
But just knowing I had that choice, I never thought I had that choice.
Even if I didn't stop believing, I never thought I had a choice in the matter.
So very freeing. And as far as anything negative, I think the only thing that felt negative for a very short period of time was I kind of realized, oh, there's no, okay.
I was very scared of deconstructing because I thought I'd commit a very blasphemous thing and would automatically just send me to hell.
So I had to be sure that that wasn't going to happen. I had to believe that there wasn't, or I had to know there wasn't a hell to send me to.
But then once I realized that, I thought, okay, well, now there's no heaven.
So, oh, well, I'm not going to be able to be reunited with my loved ones.
And this is all the time I'm going to have with them is right now.
So I have to really, truly embrace every moment.
And that was the only real grief that I felt.
But other than that, I've just been so happy to leave it all behind.
That's so good. So let's jump into your story.
So you grew up non-denominational Pentecostal, is that right?
Yeah. I mean, you say non-denominational, but everyone knows it's basically like it's its own denomination.
We were charismatic. We were speaking into all of that.
So you spoke in tongues and laying out of hands.
This is a question I often ask myself.
We used to speak all the time about miracles and the signs from God.
Do you remember any profound things that happened?
Yeah, I do actually. I remember being in this one church that we went to for about a year and a half.
And they had a lot of... I live in Canada and they had a lot of preachers that would come from Florida
and different places in the South like Alabama and stuff.
And they always came with their own ministries like prophecy or gifts of healing or gifts of miracles.
And there was one particular guy who would come and his ministry was for people to get dental fillings.
Dental fillings?
Like gold fillings in their mouth.
Okay, you have and he would come and I don't know if I actually ever saw inside the people's mouth
who were saying they were getting the fillings but people were going up and saying like I got a gold tooth.
I got a gold tooth and they'd go up and tell everyone.
But I don't know if I ever saw the person's like oh look I have a...
Or maybe they just said it and showed it and I don't know. There was no verifying of it.
Interesting. That seems like something that could be so easily verified too.
Yeah, but I've never heard... I know I've never heard... I've never seen that.
We never went that far in our church I guess but we were running around looking for gold dust when that movie Finger of Gold came out.
The same guy was always telling us look for gold dust and so people would be looking at their hands.
I used to like wash my hands before the service began because I wanted to and I wouldn't like touch my face or anything in case I had like makeup on that would give it like a shimmer.
And so there was like your hands would get shimmery but I don't know how to reconcile that.
It still could be like my lotion or I was a teenager and like glitter spray was in so I'm sure it was probably something to do with that.
I remember yeah same with our church there was like these people were obsessed with the gold dust idea and I think one time they're like that's it.
Gold dust, it's here. They're running around and it was just it looked to me like someone had touched someone who had a glittery makeup.
And that's exactly what it looked like.
It's almost like an eyeshadow.
Yeah I feel like if I looked hard enough I could find gold dust in my hand now.
That's how I sometimes I'll still look at my hand and I'm like hey I can kind of see like some shimmer and it's probably just from like body products or something of that sort.
So maybe just hugging people while you're at church and their makeup is getting on you.
Or they're praying with you or holding your hands or something.
How will all these things like explain to you?
How did you accept them?
For me I was kind of near the end of my faith when well I was kind of getting into a part of Christianity where I wasn't so on fire for God when the gold dust started happening.
I was kind of like and I was kind of thinking to myself like why is this why is the gold dust appearing or manner people were getting manner of getting their bibles.
Yeah not anywhere I saw but like in documentaries on Christian programs.
But yeah so it's like I was always wondering why that would happen.
What was your thoughts behind that?
I definitely thought it was like a move of the Holy Spirit.
I believed it.
This was in like the late 90s and I don't know if you're familiar.
You might be because of what you're doing and stuff but the Toronto blessing.
Do you know?
Oh okay so that was like a huge thing that began at a Toronto church and it's called the Toronto blessing and it was like a revival that was going on and on and on.
And I think even like Bill Johnson from Bethel like he attended it and he got some like major prophecy at that Toronto blessing revival.
So this was sort of like look how God's outpouring to our church from Toronto blooding and there you go.
So this was sort of kind of like a branch off of that at that time.
This was like a move of God that was sweeping through the nation you know to the next generation.
So it seemed very real to me.
Oh yeah and it is an interesting phenomenon like the whole revival spectacle because it's definitely like there's definitely something about it.
Like I don't know I don't think anything's going on.
I don't think like goblins are controlling the spirit realm or there's like you know I don't think there are things that are actually happening but it's interesting how it does actually happen.
It's like how we get groups of people who just become surrounded by it.
It's like a group hysteria, mass hysteria.
There's been cases of mass hysteria where people can't stop laughing or dancing for days.
Oh yeah that happens.
Oh yeah I heard about that after.
When I heard about the mass hysteria and the laughing outside of Christianity like years later I thought okay there's no way that any of that was real back in my youth because if it can happen in other places then that was definitely not God.
So that's how I kind of reconcile that later was that wasn't actually thought that was just people like getting their emotions all swelling and yeah.
So you're in this church like were you always saved or were you like did you have a rebellious teen years or did you grow up within church?
Yeah.
I was always saved.
Apparently I answered an altar call when I was like three years old.
That's adorable.
Because I knew what a sinner I was at three years old.
I guess like if anyone would have described me they would have said I've always had this love for Jesus you know.
And so yeah I answered an altar call.
I gave my life to Jesus and I feel like I was sort of just that that's just how I was.
Okay Stacey's a Christian and I just grew up that way and I wanted to just continue growing up that way because it was the right thing to do.
But because of that I got introduced to a lot of really bad theology as far as like spiritual warfare because of that at like age three years old.
Like very bad.
I don't know what the story is exactly.
It kind of comes from my grandmother.
She had a big house that had a sliding patio door and I apparently said there was a wall felt side and I was great.
Like kids say my kids say things all the time.
I would never equate that to a demon now.
But she said that I was saying oh there's a wolf outside I can't go outside there's a wolf.
And so apparently like a couple of days later one of her prayer partners called and said every time I pray I just keep seeing this like wolf outside of your house and snatching the blessings that are trying to come in.
So it was like oh well Stacey's been seeing a wolf.
And so I just then I was like okay well you can see in the spirit realm that's what I was just believing.
So I thought okay well I must have this like gift that I can see in the spirit because I've been told this since I was three.
And I was like okay well the spirit realm is a real thing and I can see it apparently.
And so that brought in like a ton of baggage now looking back before I thought oh this is such a gift but no it was not a gift.
Yeah.
Even if I believe in it it's not something that you tell you know a three year old it just it terrified it was it's terrifying to think back like I have a three year old now like I would not be telling him.
Oh you can see demons and speak to those demons and tell them to leave you know the way that you're told that in charismatic circles.
Yeah.
I know it can be it can be very wild and and you know I had a I had a schizophrenic friend and he was very into church and I remember seeing down and they were talking to me about like how they got really when they got really sick they could see demons.
Entering like they'll be walking through the shopping center and they can see and demons entering and leaving people and and they could make it every time they talk to people they could only see the demon and all this stuff.
And I and they were telling me as if it was like real and I remember just saying to them like how do you determine like the difference between like your mental condition and the spirit realm and he got like really really down like it was a it was a hard question for and I felt kind of like a dick for asking because I didn't realize it was such a.
But but yeah he like he he tried to explain it and then he kind of got a bit sad and I was like damn like this is this like this type of this perspective like praise on mental conditions and we'll get into that a little bit.
Yeah.
About because like you know I don't have schizophrenia but you know I have had some OCD stuff go on and you've had some stuff go on and we'll definitely get into that but I do want to kind of just kind of go through your story a bit linearly.
So yeah it is wild though right how like it's just wild so so you so how did you go from that to thinking that that things were like spiritual and everything to like and seeing the spirit realm to like becoming such as like questioning your faith like how did you go from that.
How old were you.
Oh my gosh.
Not that not that long ago.
Not that long ago I I basically.
I was from the time I was three.
Until how old was I in twenty nineteen thirty five.
That's when I began questioning.
Like my kind of costal thing like the charismatic all of that.
I saw a Christian documentary called the American gospel.
And it basically exposed sort of the the falseness of the of the charismatic is the word of faith movement.
They know the whole speaking things into existence.
That's speaking it's still like Joyce Meyer.
Joyce Meyer exactly.
Exactly.
They feature them in this documentary.
Okay.
And so they they really break it down and they kind of get to like the meat of the gospel.
And it answered a lot of questions that I kind of always had about what I grew up with because I found that there were so many question marks for me like about Christianity.
But I just was like well I guess I'll just know one day or I guess I don't know maybe I'm not smart enough to answer to this.
Maybe this is just you know this is God's ways are higher than my base you know like that sort of kind of sense at times.
But then this documentary came out and I was like oh my goodness.
This is everything I've kind of always felt about like spiritual warfare speaking in tongues and just being like is this actually real like our prophecy like in terms of how people prophesying now over other people like they basically that documentaries as how those were just for the the
Apostles in that time and when all the Apostles died those gifts ceased right.
So I thought well that actually makes sense.
So OK I guess I've just had the wrong version of Christianity.
I need to find the right version of Christianity so I still had like a bunch of questions but this documentary.
It was very very very heavy heavily influenced by the reformed community like Calvinist perspective and all of the pastors and preach teachers that they had that Christian that were featured in this documentary were all like basically Calvinist.
And they printed in such a like beautiful way of the gospel.
But I thought OK well I guess that's the way that I should be like looking at the Bible and I wanted to know more about how the Bible came to have to be how it was like assembled sort of like what the text actually meant.
And I had so many questions answered just on like the Pentecostal stuff that I thought I'm never going to let myself not find the answers things ever again because I found out a ton of answers.
I feel like that was like a lot of deconstructing this particular summer because I deconstructed all the gifts of the spirit like prophecy speaking in tongues.
I deconstructed spiritual warfare Christian perspective still was like this is this is bunk like I don't believe in spiritual warfare anymore.
I also deconstructed like the rapture I've no longer believed in that anymore.
So I was I was I was deconstructing things without realizing that that's what I was doing.
I was changing my views.
I was like no I don't believe in that I don't believe in that and it was feeling really good.
And I was like I'm not I'm going to keep like if I question I'm just going to like find my answer.
So that's sort of what led me that I'm not today because the questions just kind of kept coming and the doubts never fully disappeared.
And I kind of like banding a Calvinism on the doubts just to sort of like well I still have to be a Christian.
I didn't think it was an option even though I went through a time where I was like I don't think any of this is real.
But I didn't think that I couldn't be a Christian because I was so afraid of help that was so ingrained in me.
And I was more afraid of hell and I believe more in hell and like demons at times than I did in God.
And I thought if I believe in demons and I believe in God so I'm going to this is too much.
I just I can't believe I'm pooped so yeah.
KCA Randy says if you pull in the string it all comes apart and that is so true.
It is. Yeah.
Yeah.
So it wasn't until like 2021.
Sorry if you were going to ask a question but.
Oh no.
No.
It's breaking up a little bit.
Is everyone else is everyone else experiencing an OK string?
It could be me.
I'm hoping it's not me.
But but yeah.
If everyone else is experiencing an OK string that's so that's fine.
Yeah.
But so I apologize that there's a great.
Yeah.
There's a little bit of a delay and we keep talking about I apologize that that's not my fault.
So how did you go from so.
So oh that's what I was going to ask.
What is.
Okay.
So it says yes.
Stacy's kind of breaking up a tad.
Sorry.
I'm in an Airbnb.
Okay.
So you got your whole family up to leave early to to go to like to get there on time and
you got here 20 minutes before and.
Yeah.
So hopefully hopefully things work out like the audio gets a bit better.
But if not we can hope everyone can we can deal with it.
So what is so what is Calvinism?
No, it's fine.
It's not so bad.
What is Calvinism?
So I've never understood like I never understood Calvinism when I was a Pentecostal Christian
because I look at the verses in the Bible and I'm like it says the disciples will cast
out demons and drink poison and yada yada.
So what is Calvinism?
And can you give me the can you can you convert me from a Pentecostal to a Calvinist right
now?
I'm not a Pentecostal, but yeah.
Oh, hang on.
It's maybe it's the audio is like I can hardly hear you.
I wonder if it might be some people are saying it's fine.
Maybe hang on a sec.
Sorry, everybody.
Sorry.

I mean, hey, but how is everyone doing?
How's everyone doing?
And how's everyone going?
We got 15 love viewers.
It's really cool.
And when I went on the on Stacy's channel, we had a wild time.
You guys should definitely go check that out because I'm like, we were just having the
best time.
I don't know.
Something was going on with my brain at that moment.
And I was like, you know, I was just like, I just had all these like stories.
One of the things I kind of didn't think I was going to mention, but I think I should
tell everyone is the story that one time, you know, we talked about spiritual warfare.
And things like that.
One time when I was training to be a youth pastor, I mentioned this on Godless engineer
stream.
I, we, there was this like, I went down to preach to the small group down in like one
part of our youth on Friday night.
And one of the, and I ended up preaching about all these things spiritual, like these big
amazing things that happened and yada, yada.
And one of the youth who was in like 14 at the time started to like demonically manifest
and it was, it was, it was really like, it was really whack.
So a few things.
One, you've run out the door.
So he starts, someone pulled me over and said, we got to pray for this person.
We're praying for them.
And then they just burst through our prayer circle and then open the door and run, try
to run off around.
We chase them.
So we're chasing this like youth through the church.
And he, he, he burst through the door.
But then it's really funny because all these stories started to form instantly about, oh,
he didn't actually touch the door knob.
He just, he just pulled it open with the power of the demons.
Right.
And you can, you can see how this could maybe happen in like a Jesus story.
I don't know.
But all these stories started happening and we bring him into this room and we're trying
to pray for him.
He's spitting on us.
He's like screaming.
He's spitting on my face.
And I'm saying like the power of Christ, you know, compels you.
I didn't say that, but I was saying all these things.
It was a really wild time.
And so that happened for like our almas were in this room and me and these youth and these
leaders are trying to like hold this guy down and we're screaming it for this demon to get
out.
And he would like scream, this big scream, like, ah, and then he would go.
Um, he would say like, he would just smile and then I'm, he would say, I'm back and like
pretend like this demon would come back.
And it was like the same thing over and over and over again.
Um, and, uh, it got so bad that the, that like his parents were waiting in the parking lot
for like 45 minutes.
And the, the current youth pastor came in and said, what's going on?
He finished the prayer.
They jumped in the car.
Um, and, uh, he jumped in the car with his parents.
And then he, um, like everyone was like standing around the car, like talk to him and we're
trying to explain to the parents.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're there or whatever.
And River City Films, he River City Films was actually, he was, he was the youth that
called me over and said, we need to pray for this person.
And he was in the room with me.
Oh my gosh.
That's amazing.
Thanks for the Super Chat River City Films.
And, um, and anyway, he just burst out of the car and runs off.
So now we're chasing this like youth through the parking lot of the church at like 11 o'clock
at night.
His parents have been waiting in the car for like 40 minutes.
And yeah, it was bad.
A lot of, a lot of parents pulled their kids out of youth group at that, at that time.
It was, um, it was a wild experience.
But if you want to hear a full version, uh, you can listen to it on Godless Engineer
Stream.
Um, but Stacey is back.
Okay.
Hey Stacey.
Is this better?
Oh, it's way better.
Okay.
Good.
I'm so sorry you guys.
No, that's okay.
Everyone got to hear a fun story about, um, my, uh, demon casting and a demon out of
a, uh, out of a, um, uh, youth member casting and a demon.
And I called him up and I spoke to him about this.
Um, and, uh, and I also want to share, I thank you, River City Films.
You became a member of the channel.
I really appreciate that.
Thank you so much.
Um, the, but, but I rang up this person and spoke to them and they're kind of like
a, like a upcoming, they will, I reckon they'll be famous one day, very famous one
day, um, uh, recording artists.
So, um, and ask them, do you want to come on?
And they said, honestly, like, they don't really remember a lot of it because it was
like the kind of, it's so traumatic to kind of like put that part of their life in the
different area in their brain.
But, um, anyway, back to your story.
So explain what is Calvinism?
So Calvinism is, it's okay.
So when we, I was in a Pentecostal church, it would have been considered like the,
like the dry church.
They don't have the Holy spirit.
They're, they're boring.
They're very liturgical.
But how I thought they were, when I was in it is they just, they really follow the Bible.
Um, they just, they're, they're really in, like, they're just very into doctrine and
dogma and, um, very rural, very rural, uh, based.
And, uh, they have the, there's like the five points of Calvinism.
So there's like total depravity, unconditional grace, limited atonement, irresistible, something
and, or, I don't know, they have like all these different perseverance of the saints.
So they believe also in like elections.
So, um, it's not really like your choice that you're saved.
God elected you or predestined you to be saved before the beginning of time.
And you also don't know who God elected to be saved.
So you definitely have to preach the gospel to everyone.
Um, and also if somebody like me, yeah, someone like me who has fallen away, um, I was never
saved to begin with because someone who's truly saved does not turn away from the faith.
So, um, yeah.
That's pretty universal, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Every Christian I've ever spoken to says that I was never a true Christian and I'm like,
okay, well, I guess I'm never a true Christian.
Yeah.
I know.
So I remember they're very dogmatic.
I remember having a friend come over from, uh, it was, uh, I used to do game development
and, and he was, uh, he was somebody who did one of my courses and he came over from Canada
actually and he came over to Australia and said, Hey, I'm, I'm in this area.
I said, actually that's five minutes from where I live.
Do you want to grab a beer?
And I was like, yeah, let's grab a beer.
We went to the, um, we went to just talk about game development.
We went to the pub and we ended up talking about religion the whole time and he was a
staunch Calvinist.
Like he was like, and, and I said, and I, and I never, I didn't really know what covenants
was at the time.
And I said, and I was an atheist.
I was deconstructing at the time.
And I said, how do you reconcile?
So do you believe that God just creates people destined for health?
And he said, eventually he said, yes.
And I said, that makes going out to be incredibly cruel.
And he was like, and, and he's like, well, I know he's like, people make that claim all
the time, but that's what the Bible says.
And I'm like, okay.
And then he, he flipped it on me and he said, do you think, um, he's like, do you, did you
believe in Pentecostal like praying, praying for people and healing?
I was like, yeah.
And he's like, he's like, I think that's immoral because why aren't those people outside of
a different hospital every single day?
And I was just like, oh, we're both kind of pulling out the immorality of each other's
like theology.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Um, yeah, it's wild.
So, um, so, and so is there like a main scripture and just before we move off Calvinism, there
are main scripture that they have for the, um, I guess for that, the fact that some people
are just elected and some people aren't, is there a scripture that they point to?
Oh, there, there definitely are some, um, I think in, in Romans, it's been so long.
There are some a lot that definitely have the word like elected and like God elected.
And it's like, yeah, you can kind of see it.
It's like, yeah, that it says it right there.
You can, you can see that kind of what they're saying makes sense in a way.
And, uh, you can believe it.
If you have that thinking of a Calvinist, you're like, yeah, no, I think they're right.
So, um, that's, it's easy to, to kind of understand, but it's also very sadistic at the same time.
Like that's one thing my husband was just like, I don't like that.
That just seems really awful.
I always make this joke that like I will, uh, because it's so funny that your husband is
so much like my wife, um, in that like, like this, so many times where like, I'll like burst through the door.
I'm like, oh my gosh, I just discovered this thing that totally changes our whole worldview and everything is like a lie.
And Amy will be like cutting up, cutting up some stuff for a cheese board.
She's like, oh, okay.
She's like, that's interesting.
Anyway, do you want, um, and she doesn't care.
Like, I'm like, but doesn't this like, or like, I'll tell us, doesn't this have a like a knock on effect for everything that you believe?
And she's like, I guess so.
And I'm like, does that matter?
It does.
Oh my God.
Like, and I was always, I was always worried too.
Cause, um, I don't know if, uh, it's Brian.
Sorry, your, your partner, Brian.
Brian.
His name.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I, I was always worried that Amy wasn't saved.
So I would like, because she'd never spoke in tongues.
So I was always like really worried about that.
Yeah.
So you, you're the same with Brian.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly the same.
Yeah.
So it's, uh, it's super, super, it's super.
Yeah.
It puts you in a super weird spot. Hey.
So how did you go from, um, how do you go from Calvinism to, uh, to leaving your beliefs all together?
Um, it, you know what?
We moved away from our, our church from everyone we knew.
And, um, it's being away from everything is when I started really doubting it all.
And it was like everything, my brain kind of cleared and we weren't in church all the
time, like two days or two times on Sundays.
And, uh, it was just moving away and not being in that bubble.
And I was starting to really think and I was like, you know, this isn't really making
sense.
And you know, this, I don't know if I, if I really want to do this anymore.
And I think I want to kind of explore this idea.
And I started listening to other podcasts and documentaries.
Um, I even listened to a podcast or a documentary on the effects of purity culture put out by
Joshua Harris, uh, who wrote, I kiss dating goodbye.
I don't know if you remember that book at all.
No, I, I, I don't remember that book.
No, but I know, I know the name.
We had this, um, uh, preach, uh, preach from one of the, the, the, the wife of the youth
pastor.
So I guess she was also a youth pastor.
I don't know, but, but she's, she, she was created this like preach that was like dating
what to do.
And we're all like, you know, with baited breath, like waiting, like, what do we do?
Cause we're all new Christians.
And she's like, don't, she's like caught.
And I was like, what?
And we're like, and she's like, yes, you caught for marriage.
I'm like, okay.
And like, she did this whole preach about it.
We're like, wow.
Okay.
That's weird.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So he wrote this book in the nineties.
That was basically at the same thing.
And like every time you even like, he, the start of the book was like, imagine you're getting
married to your spouse and then every person that you ever like were intimate with comes
up at the altar and is standing there with you with your spouse.
And they're all like, they have a part of your life and they come into that marriage with
you.
And it's just like, so it just paints this picture of you, like you give a piece of yourself
away to everyone.
Right.
So he later, it was all, it was in like 2019.
I think he, he deconverted and he apologized for the damage that his book did.
I was actually quite curious.
Yeah.
I think he's, if he's not an atheist, he might be like agnostic, but he doesn't believe anymore.
And so I wanted to, I heard he had a documentary out and he kind of like, he went around and
just like talk to people that, that book affected in a major way.
And as I was watching the documentary, I'm like, Hey, purity culture did kind of mess
me up.
Like maybe it is really screwed up.
And so that was kind of wheels were starting to turn just about that.
And that was sort of the beginning.
That wasn't like what, you know, sparked my whole deconversion, but it just kind of got
me thinking of just Christianity in general.
And I was like, I don't know, this seems pretty bad.
Yeah.
And I kind of just like, I went from there and it, you know, just from one thing to the
next, and I just was getting like, more like, I want to know more, I want to know more,
like this is so fascinating.
And I was kind of feeling the same way that I did when I found out about how everything
I believed about like the Pentecostal church and like that kind of movement, I was getting
that same sort of like realization and this like epiphany moments, like every day I was
like, okay, this is blowing my mind.
I need to continue this because something's happening here and I don't want to stop it.
And that's basically what led me into deconverting is I was just like, I have to find out more
like things are starting to click.
And I need to go all this momentum is, is like at its peak.
And I also needed some like permission, not permission, but I was afraid of hell, like
I said, and I kind of cornered my husband in the kitchen one day because I was like,
I'm so scared.
Like, he didn't know all the turmoil I was in and the excitement at the same time.
But I was like, what if there's a hell like what if I do this and I end up going there
and he had that quote, which you kind of had a little bit of a reminder me of the quote
you said at the beginning, like a small part of like the one he said to me, but he's like,
I saw this quote on Twitter, maybe it'll help you.
I don't know.
And it just, it said like life is the spark between two identical voids, the one before
birth and the one after death.
And it was just this like light bulb went off.
And I was like, Oh my God, before I was born was an eternity.
And I have no recollection.
I wasn't being tortured.
I wasn't like nothing was happening.
I have no memory of it.
And it's probably going to be the exact same when I die.
So I have nothing to lose.
I don't think I need to be afraid of this.
And that was kind of how my fear of hell just completely disappeared, which was crazy because
that was like 37, 38 years of fearing it.
And then I needed to also know the history of how hell got brought into the church.
Like I didn't just stop right there.
I was like, Hey, well now how did this even come into play?
Yeah.
So it's like, you know, approaching intellectually rather than emotionally, like that also helped
like, you know, like when I thought of it, like I've had a lot of discussions in my deconstruction
and debates with people and a lot of thoughts would like pop up.
And one of the thoughts I had was like the same thing.
It's like, you know, where do we go when we die?
I don't know, but it'll probably feel like the 13.8 billion years before we existed.
Like probably feel like that.
Or, or another one is that helped me.
It was one of my thoughts that I said to my cousin and he said, you know, what happens when, you know,
where do you think we go when we die?
And I said, I think we go.
I thought about it and I said, I think we go to the same place a flame goes when you blow out a candle.
It's like, you don't think of it like it goes somewhere.
It's just no ceases to exist.
It's gone.
Like there's a freedom in that, isn't there?
Like for me, for me, there's like a, there's some part of a sadness, but it's also,
it actually makes me appreciate life so much more.
Like I want to travel.
I want to spend time with my family.
I want to not sweat the small stuff and like, you know, like, yeah.
Exactly.
Oh, totally.
I remember just waking up the first couple of months, like excited.
I had butterflies in my stomach every single day.
Cause I was just like, there's this whole world I can learn about now.
And I was just like, I was checking out books from the library.
I didn't read them all, but I just was like, I want to get this one and this one and this one.
And I've come home.
Oh yeah.
Well, you see, that's what I did.
Look at half those I haven't even read because like, well, I got, this is so amazing.
And I'll buy it.
And I've been like years gone past and like, I've got to read this book, but I keep getting more.
Yeah.
I wanted to know everything.
And I was just like, it was so exciting.
And I was like, tell my husband something.
Cause I never looked at evolution before cause I've never believed in evolution.
Right.
So then I'd find out something really fascinating.
I'm like, did you know this?
And he's like, yeah.
He's like, you did.
I'm like, no.
Cause I just thought, well, that's, I'm not going to even look at it because I believe in creation.
So why would I even entertain the thought of evolution?
So then just tiny little things about evolution were just so cool.
Um, when I learned them and I was just like, man, I wish I knew about this from my whole life,
but I don't know if it would have been as fascinating when I learned them in school.
I probably just been like, okay, cool.
Like that's great.
But now it's like, this is so incredible.
Um, so yeah.
Just to, just to give, uh, Kent Hoven a clip to work with if he ever does me,
if he waxes me as an atheist, but, um, for, for me when I, cause he always talks about
evolution being evolution as long as a religion, he always talks about being a religion.
Um, it, it's definitely not.
It's a science, but, but, but I was so blown away by it that it almost felt like a religion
when I first started looking into it.
I was so overwhelmed with, with awe and wonder and mystery.
And, and I couldn't stop looking at fossils.
And I was like, oh my God, like look at this.
Like, and I would look at our, um, our Beagle and I'm like, you know, we got him,
we got him de-sexed.
And I'm like 3.4 billion years.
You'll see, you've, you've, there's been a successful line of 3.4.
And we've just ended it like done.
Like you'll never have a descendant.
And I'm just like, that is overwhelming.
That's incredible.
And like I'm, I'm looking at his eyes and his ears and I'm going like how, you know,
we, how we've, we've kind of, we've kind of not, um, selected these animals to be more cute
for us.
And it was just, I was just kind of blown away.
It actually made me, um, think more about my, my food choices as well.
I became a vegetarian because I was like, cause I would be like, I'd look at the animals
and I'm like, if we're just animals, like, like it was, it was for me, it was really wild.
It was interesting.
There's something, something that, um, you really wanted to talk about and I'm,
this is the part that I'm most excited to talk about is what I'm going to phrase as
magical thinking, which is the need, the need to confess the mental health that comes along
with issues that come along with, um, with, with these type of church environments.
Uh, so can you go into a little bit about you?
So I released a video for those who haven't watched it.
Um, it's, uh, it's called my OCD story.
Uh, and, um, I spent lots of time editing it and no one cares.
It's like, you know, you spend all this time doing something.
Thank you.
I'm like, I'm like, this is going to be a banger.
And it's like a hundred views.
I'm like, dammit.
And then I'll put no other video.
And it's like, everyone's like, woo.
This is amazing.
I'm like, dammit.
It's funny how YouTube works.
But I, the, the, the, you know, we have a lot of people who are like,
you know, with the OCD, um, just to give everyone a recap of what,
what happened to me.
So, um, and just quickly, I was, was, um, trying to get back with,
like have a stronger relationship with God.
And I had, um, I was in my father's woodworking shop and I was praying.
And I heard this, um, I was making Amy a jewelry box,
which I ended up making you and giving to her.
And, um, I heard this, I started praying cause I wanted to open up my heart to God.
I felt, I felt this booming voice say break up with Amy.
And I immediately had a panic attack and I went outside and I was vomiting
and vomiting in the garden because I just panicked anyway.
And the panic text got so bad.
I was vomiting every night, but, you know, in walking around the street,
I lost a bunch of weight, which was kind of cool.
But besides that, I was, it was not living a good life.
I couldn't get out of bed.
Um, and stuff like that for a long part of the day.
And I was seeing like, you know, Sunday I would go to church Monday,
I'd go to church counseling Tuesday, I'd go to prayer at night.
Wednesday I'd go to another church counselor or mentoring and Thursday or mentoring.
Like I was doing things every day of the week.
And my parents begged me to go to a secular psychologist.
Eventually I decided to go to the secular psychologist and they,
the first session they were just asking questions.
I was pretty much filling out a form.
I thought it was really stupid.
And the second time I went along, they asked me to repeat out loud,
what if God wants me to break up with Amy?
And I said, no, no, I can't, I can't do that.
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, what if I take it literally?
What if I push past you or run out and I call her and I break out with her?
What if I said, I'm a Christian and you know,
the Bible says that there's life and death in the power of the tongue.
I don't want to confess it of my life.
And he was really fine with me.
And he's like, no, no, he's like, you're going to stand here
and you're going to say, what if God wants me to break up with Amy?
And I argued with him for a while.
And then eventually I said, what if God wants me to break up with Amy?
And he's like, say it again.
I'm like, what if God wants me to break up with Amy?
And then my anxiety is building.
He's like, say it again.
And I kept doing this for about a couple of minutes until I'm panicking.
I'm having a huge panic attack.
And mind you, I felt like I was in an episode of psychosis for like three,
four weeks.
Like I, from, from this moment that I was in my dad's tool shop,
I was just constantly at a fight or flight, like nine,
like a nine on the anxiety scale all the time.
And actually at about midday, I'd go down to about a five out of 10.
Like I was, for some reason midday was okay,
but nighttime and mornings were horrible.
And, and eventually I'm saying any,
I'm like looking for a binda vomit in his, his office.
And I'm like looking around and I'm like, I'm going to vomit.
And he's like, say it again, say it again, say it again.
And eventually it was like click.
And it's like, I was saying, what if God wants to break up with Amy?
What if God, and then all of a sudden I was like,
what if God wants to break up with Amy?
And then he's like, say it again.
I'm like, what, why did I ever think that?
And it was honestly like, it was like Paul on the road to Damascus,
like the scales fell from my eyes.
Like I honestly was like, it just broke.
And I was just like, and I was like, why did I ever think that
God wanted me to break up with Amy?
And that realization was like to cut a long story short is
I kind of realized that the voice of God for me in that moment was
an OCD tick.
Why could a tool of psychology work on what I thought was a pretty
strong voice from God?
Um, you know, so it was wild.
Um, hey, you don't, uh, hey, everyone that's in the chat.
Thank you for listening.
I can't see any comments.
Oh, okay.
So that's, um, so that was like what I shared.
You said that you said something really interesting to me and
you said that you always had a need to confess.
And, and that, I don't know if you know this, but that actually
is a one of the, I'm not, we're not diagnosing anyone with OCD at
the moment, but that is, that is one of the things that, um,
that people with OCD can tend to have.
And that's definitely how mine manifested.
So yeah, tell us a little bit about that.
Yeah.
So I, I've been listening to like some more OCD things this week
because I'd never actually had got an official diagnosis.
I never, um, but I, you know, you can kind of tell after so many
years and listening to, to doctors on YouTube that are psychiatrists,
I am 99.999% sure that if I were to see if I would have OCD,
um, just given the, the intrusive thoughts, the racing thoughts,
the constant need to confess those thoughts in order to feel any
kind of relief, but that relief only lasts momentarily until
those thoughts come back, um, avoiding triggers for those
thoughts, um, like places, uh, situations, songs, TV shows,
uh, scenarios and TV shows that could trigger the thought.
Um, so this started when I was young, like a teenager and,
uh, I would, they'd wake me up from the, like, dead asleep and
they'd wake me up and they would just go over and over and over
and over and over and it could not go back to sleep.
And the only way I could get up is I'd lay there in agony.
Um, but the time, the whole time I would be thinking this is Satan.
I didn't necessarily think this was me.
Okay.
So I thought that I was having an attack from the enemy.
Um, and I would just, my stomach would be in knots.
I would feel like I'm going to either throw up or just,
I felt sick and I just remember laying in bed, having these
intrusive thoughts that were not true.
Um, they were never anything that was true, but they would just
not stop and I would have to get up, wake up my mom, get her
to come and lay with me and I would just, but it would take all the
courage in me to, to work out, to tell her the thought and I'd
lay there and I'd say that you're going to think I'm the
worst person in the world.
You're going to think I'm horrible for even thinking this is not
true.
And she would just reassure me, no, I, you're not, you're not bad.
You're like, you're a good girl.
I never, I never, you asked if I had a rebellious stage ever.
I did it.
I never did.
Um, I, I never, ever acted out.
Um, I never partied.
I never drank.
I never was promiscuous.
Never any of those things.
I wanted to be as pure and as good because I never wanted to
have to confess for any other thing.
So just, just quick side note.
Did you ever, did you ever, uh, do drugs or anything like that
in your life?
Yeah.
I was thinking, I heard you say something like that about
never smoke a weed or something on, on, or something on
another one of your shows.
Research.
And I thought, oh, have you have now?
Well, just in the last six months.
Oh, cool.
Oh, awesome.
I was like, um, yeah.
Yeah.
I was thinking like, cause deep drinks is going to go
international when we can, um, when we, this channel keeps
growing, I want to start doing in live, in-person interviews
and stuff.
This is a joke, but I was thinking how funny it would be
if like we both did, um, a trip together.
Um, because I've never done it.
And it'd be like, it'd be, I'm terrified of it.
So I'm like, oh, let's go take our families and we'll go
trip out.
Talk about, talk about the universe.
We do a long 12 hour deep drinks episode anyway.
It's a joke.
No.
So I, I was, I, I was straight.
Okay.
I've never tried a cigarette.
Like I'm, I'm 39.
Like I've never tried a cigarette, nothing, but like six
months ago and yeah, I have no desire to, but six months ago,
like when I, I was like, you know what, I, if I want, I can
try it.
It's legal hearing.
I'll try it.
So that was it.
Okay.
Six months ago, everyone.
That's my big thing.
What was it like?
Did you, did you get, did you get, uh, did you experience it?
Cause a lot of people don't experience the high for the
first time.
Did you experience it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I laugh a lot just in, in general, and it just kind of
intensifies just, I just get very like, he, he, he, this is so
funny and everything's hilarious.
And yeah.
Funny, just a funny story.
Like we, we were going to go to Amsterdam and, um, and I,
I have a background in, um, in, I went to like a rehab at one
stage, but it wasn't for anything.
It's so weird.
I didn't need to go.
I thought I was becoming like schizophrenic cause I was smoking
weed for a few weeks.
Like it was, it was ridiculous that I went like people were
like, why I'm here with people from jail and with heroin
addictions and stuff.
And I'm just like, I've smoked weed for a few weeks, but that's
what, that's what the church told me.
I had to hit rock bottom.
So I was like, let's hit rock bottom.
I'll go to a rehab.
Like it was, it was another, another story for another time.
But, um, so I was never, you know, I was like, I'm not going to
smoke weed again.
And we're married.
And then Amy one day says, um, and she's never smoked a
cigarette.
She's never even said some swear words.
Like she's very similar, like very, very, very proper.
And, um, and she goes, we've talked about going to Amsterdam.
She's like, oh, I want to try a hash cookie.
And I was just like, what?
I was like, really?
And then, and then we're like, yeah.
And then we're talking about, and then, um, we sort of
talked to friends about it.
And I was like, that's such a, I've never thought I'd hear you
say that.
And then she's like, and people are like, well, cookies, you
know, you don't, you might not want to try cookies, but
you might want to try smoking and, and because, you know, you
can control it.
Yeah.
And then it was just like, and then it was like, and then
someone's like, well, if you want to do it over in Amsterdam,
you may as well try it here in Australia.
Um, and I'm not confessing any crimes at any one, but
hypothetically, um, yeah, hypothetically, we might have
gone down to the beach, like really late at night and like
smoke weed as if like, we're like, and like, and like walk
back through the bushes, like all, and it was not a good
experience because of the setting that we're in.
Cause we're, we're both kind of like hiding it and being
secret and, you know, like that.
Hypothetically.
Um, so.
Yeah.
It's that it was, it was, it was, and then we did, I did it
a few times.
I had a panic attack and then when we got to Amsterdam, I
never did it in Amsterdam.
Yeah.
No.
So all of the intrusive thoughts were completely sober.
Yeah.
Completely sober.
Um, so, so did I, I, I really resonate with how you say
you've had a need to confess and like confess to God,
confess to people.
Um, oh, it's just, it's just, it's, it's absolutely wild.
Um, how, how, how crippling it can be.
Like, uh, one of my family members had really bad OCD.
Um, and they would, they would have to say at night, good
night, I'll see you in the morning.
And if, and they couldn't sleep on us, everyone in the
house had said that back to them.
Like it was really debilitating for the person.
Like it was horrible.
Or sometimes, and their, their OCD got so bad that it would
take them 45 minutes to go to bed because they had to check
the clock on the, um, on the oven, uh, for 45 minutes from
every angle.
We had to like check this angle, that, that angle.
We had to open it like four times and close like all this
horrible stuff.
That was like proper OCD.
That wasn't like, um, when people go like, oh, I'm so clean.
Like that's the very difference.
Yeah.
But, yeah, but, um, the need to confess.
Um, and, and, and I'll ask you a little bit about this, but
I'll share something that happened to me.
I had this, I have this need to confess and I was affected
by purity culture.
So I always felt that I had to confess every, at any time I
had, um, looked at porn or something to Amy.
So when we were dating, I would be like, Hey, I stuffed up
again.
Like, and it was horrible.
Like one, it's kind of like too much information.
Kind of like for Amy, Amy's like, I don't like, she would
always be like, I don't care.
Like, you know, you don't.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I feel like, but I just always would have to tell.
I felt like I couldn't move on until I told everyone about
it.
And thank God, Amy can think Neil deGrasse Tyson and Amy
can, uh, Amy put up with me all through that.
But every time I would like sin, I guess like that, I would
have these true thoughts that I need to confess.
And I remember we got past all that we're married where
everything was going good.
And these intrusive thoughts were, um, we're still kind of
playing around here and there.
But what would happen, um, uh, what happened was, um,
Amy's like, just stop telling me, like every time you
think, you know, like every time you like masturbate or
something, just, you don't need to tell me, like, I don't
care.
Like I do it like it's fine, whatever.
And I was like, cool.
Like, awesome.
And we, we got past that in our relationship.
Um, but one thing that was super, super wild was one time
Amy told me something and it was like, it was one of my
friends.
She thought had come on tour at a party and it was like
a really, like it was really, it was, she was not sure
she should tell me because it, she wasn't sure if it was
really, it really happened.
But it was a very vulnerable thing for her to do.
And then, and then, and then I, then as a result, because
she said that I felt like I had to confess something.
And the only thing I could think about was to confess, this
is going to sound so wild and please no one judge me.
It's a mental condition, but I felt like I had to confess
about every girl that was in our friend group that I had
found attractive or thought about in a lossful way.
And it's, it, it sounds worse than it is because just
saying that like, Oh, I think this person's pretty.
This is not, but, but when I'm walking around the kitchen
pacing up and down, having a panic attack and Amy's like,
what's wrong?
I'm like, I need to tell you something.
I need to tell you something.
And then I'm like, I thought about this person and I thought
about the, and, and she's sitting there like what, like
she's thinking like I've cheated on her, but all I'm
doing is telling her about lossful thoughts I've had of
people in our friend group.
And it's like, which, and, and it sounds worse than it is.
You can't, you can't confess something like that.
And it's sound is, I can say like, Oh yeah, I think my
friends are hot.
Like I think some of my friends are great.
Like whatever.
Like it's, it's cool.
The way I'm approaching it, like I'm confessing and I'm like,
I need to tell you something.
It's like, yeah.
And it was horrible.
And Amy's like, yeah.
No, I was just going to say, like Amy's, Amy's trying to
be supportive.
This is also a little bit like taken aback and a little bit
hurt because it's like, because it's like, I'm, it's
almost like, it's almost like I'm making it sound way worse
than it is.
Like she's, I'm making it sound horrible.
It was just, it was just a nightmare.
And I remember I kept like, she kept like trying to bring
me back to reality and I kept confessing stuff and then,
and then feeling bad.
And we're up to like 3am.
And I just had to, I just took a bunch of volume and went
to sleep, like took enough volume so I could not, not
not dangerously, but took a couple of volume and went to
sleep.
So, but yeah, it was, it was horrible.
Like, but it's like moments like that.
Like I've gone to a psychologist and the psychologist is
like, actually, I think I went to my parents and my parents
like, David, get on medication.
Please get on medication.
And I was like, I was like, I went to a doctor and I was
like, all right, the third time's a charm.
Like I'll take the medication you've been telling me to
take for years.
And I took it and it was fantastic.
But what were you saying?
I feel like I've had the exact same story.
I'm sitting here.
My heart is pounding because like I'm all I could almost cry
right now just in release because there was a time where
yeah, I was, it was years ago, but I was, I went through a
time where I was like, I felt this constant need.
Like, and I went to my mom because my mom was the only
person that could literally cleanse me of my sense.
It wasn't God.
I felt like I was the only one.
I was the only person that could literally cleanse me of my
sense.
It wasn't God.
I couldn't get that feeling from God.
I'd go to my mom and I'd be like, she's like, Stacy, it's
normal.
You're a person.
You have eyes.
It's normal.
If you think Brian doesn't think people are attractive,
you're crazy.
Like it's just human nature.
And I'm like, okay, but I feel so bad.
And I think what also made, but it was real.
The thing is it, I thought I was going to go insane.
Yeah.
Like I had to take something to help me sleep as well.
Like we have gravel here in Canada, which is like to help with
nausea, but it also knocks you out and you can just buy it over
the counter.
And I was taking gravel to sleep because I could not sleep.
And I, I was praying on the prayers.
I thought, have I, have I built up these strongholds?
Do I need to tear down strongholds?
Do I need to perform spiritual warfare?
I was losing weight.
I, all I could drink was ginger ale.
I could sip it throughout the day.
My mind was just, because I felt this immense guilt and shame.
And then I remember saying to Brian, I was like, do I need to
confess?
Like I just, what if someone is attractive?
He's like, and we're not the jealous type at all.
Neither of us are jealous.
Yeah.
Like if someone thinks he's attractive, I was like, oh, that's
so awesome.
Cause you're mine.
And I think you're attractive.
So yay.
And he's the same way of like, we are not jealous people.
And we trust each other and I adore him.
But I would just be like, but you know what it is.
It's also, you know, the scripture that says like, if you, even
so much as lost after a woman, you committed adultery in your
heart.
And that seriously, like it.
Like I felt that I was stuck with my brain.
Like I don't know if I can swear, but that literally.
Yeah, you can swear.
I thought, okay.
Well, then that's it.
I've committed adultery.
If I thought someone was cute and I was like, wow, he's really
cute.
I'm an adulterer at heart.
Yeah.
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do now?
And so I just felt trapped.
I would.
It's wild, right?
That even now, like, sometimes those sorts will, will kind of
like, like trickle in a little bit.
But I've learned to, like my psychologist has got me to laugh
at them and like kind of like, laugh at them and like, talk about
them, not never talk about them in a confessing way, but talk
about them in a, in fact, like, so I remember this time recently
when I, I became friends with just really good friend of my
now, but I come friends with this girl at university.
at university. There was a photo on her Instagram, and it was one of those nudie bum photos, where
all the girls are like, eh, and they're to the back of them, so you can just see their
bums kind of thing. And I was like, oh, that's funny, cute. That's kind of cute. It was a
funny photo. And it wasn't like, I was like, oh my god, I've seen internet porn. I'm not
blown away by bums. But I was like, oh, that's cute. And her message was like, funny photo.
But then she would pop up every now and again. And I remember seeing her pop up, and then
remembering the photo, I'm like, oh, that's right. And I clicked on her profile, and looked
at the photo again. And I thought, oh no. Am I crossing the line now? Because now I've
gone back to look at the photo, but I was kind of looking at it because it was a fun
photo. It was kind of cute. And yeah, a bunch of girls' bums, whatever. I like that. But
in my mind, I'm like, oh my gosh, have I just gone? Do I need to, am I having unholy thoughts
about my friend, and I need to tell Amy about it, and start creating distance between me
and this person? It was really weird. And I think I ended up telling, I was a bit anxious
a little bit. And I was like, oh, God, I'm getting stupid, intrusive thoughts. And I told
Amy, and she like laughed, I like laughed. And we kind of moved on. But it's back in
the day, I would have been like, oh my God, I would have been like panicking and like
been like, what do I do? Like I'm now flirting with the idea of like, you know, I'm already
like planning like, okay, Amy's gonna break out with me when I can't control myself. And
I end up sleeping with someone else. And then I'm gonna like, like, it's like, I'm already,
I'm already moved out. I'm already like seeing Atlas on every second weekend. Like, I'm like,
it's already my brain's already down, like the most traumatic route ever. And it's all my fault.
Yeah, like,
catastrophe, right? You go, yeah, catastrophe.
Yeah. And yeah, oh my gosh, I get it.
It's so good to know that someone else has a weird brain like that.
I know. But see, I was afraid, I started looking into like therapy. But I was too afraid of going
to therapy because I thought, well, they're going to make me talk about it. I can't say it out loud.
I was too afraid to go and actually talk about it because I didn't want to say anything. And
then I thought if I tell them, yeah, that's my mom, she knows.
Oh, is that your mom?
That's my mom.
Hello, she can see you.
Yeah. So I was just terrified. I'm like, if I go there, I'm going to have to talk about it. And
then I was afraid if I go and then I come back and say my husband's like, Oh, how was it? What did
you guys talk about? I'd be like, what am I going to tell him? Or I don't want to have to repeat
anything. I just didn't want to talk about it. I only wanted to talk to my mom.
And what's ironic is you're probably like, if you're having those thoughts, like, I don't know how
bad it got for you. But if you're having those thoughts about like, what if I find someone
attractive? And you're probably the thought is like, if I find someone else attractive, it's
going to maybe ruin our marriage, or it's an unholy thought, and I'm unclean or whatever, and
it's going to cause issues in our relationship. And one of those things, one of the ways that
manifests is through maybe not having sex as much, or maybe not, you know, having those intimate
moments, or maybe not having to be able to bond with them. And then as a result, you protect
yourself, and you protect yourself from going down that route. But then that the result of that is
usually you're not in the mood to have sex, you're not in the mood to be intimate, because you're
fighting this thing. It's horrible, right? It's just, it's so bad. Yeah. I just felt, I just, I
would come down on myself so hard, right? Like, constantly. And like, why would he's asked if I
was done? I'm not done. So if my mom is there, she can text them and tell him I'm not done. Stay
away. Please text him. Anyways, so yeah, but okay, so even though I didn't go to therapy or
anything, which I still want to do, it's not covered here. I don't really know. I would like to go
to it, but I'm not afraid of it anymore, thankfully. Yeah. But I did, it took me a year to get the
courage to go to the doctor and at least get on medication. So that did help. So I didn't leave
it untreated. Do you mind if I ask what you want? Are you on like an SSRI? Yeah, I'm on Lexapro and
it's just been Prozac. Okay, yeah, it's, it's to me, like, you hear all these horror stories about
that. And I didn't take it because for horror stories, I had like a dry mouth for two weeks,
and then all my symptoms, most of my symptoms went away. I could reduce the ups and downs by
like 80%. Like it was fantastic. I know most people don't get that, but I just want to put out a
positive experience because it's like, you only hear about vaccine injuries, you don't really
hear about like a positive vaccine experience, because, you know, even though it's way more
common. Exactly. No, I've been on it now. I stopped it while I was pregnant for our last son, but
he was born four years ago. And then I went back on it three years ago. And I, I have no intention
because of going off because it's working. And I, there, there has been times where I've
needed to pick up my prescription, and I forgot for like five or six days. And okay, I'll go. But
then I have noticed I'm like, Oh my God, I actually really need this stuff. Yeah. And then I'm also
it can be worse after you get off it. I'm on a migraine medication as well.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Non-migraines are nice. Hey, I don't know about, but I'm on a migraine medication.
No, but it's also a side effect of that is also a, what's the word? Oh, it's a, it's a mood.
There's a mood stabilizer in it. Okay. And yeah, but I don't, I'm not taking it for that. It's just
kind of like an added bonus. So I take it for migraines. So I'm like, okay. A lot of people
riff on the pharmaceutical industry and, you know, there's definitely some problems there,
but holy crap, like the, what we can do with medication is like a miracle, only miraculous,
you know, it's, it's amazing. Something, so we can touch on, we can touch on the mental health
stuff again, like touch on, keep talking about it, but I do want to quickly bring up. Are you okay,
are you okay to go a little bit over or do you need to like pretty much do 90 minutes? Yeah.
Okay. I just didn't want to go a little bit over. Yeah. If your husband wants to, if your husband
wants to come in and kids, no, I'm good. If you kicked him outside and he's sitting in the garden
with the kids. He can do it like that. Okay. So one thing you talked about on another channel,
you talked about COVID, COVID being a kind of a turning point for you in regards to
the misinformation that was out there. So you got unfollowed by a bunch of people on Facebook or
Instagram when you pointed out that you were vaccinated. Now it's very political in the U.S.
and I'm sure Canada and it's moderately political here as well, which is silly because it's
just to be science. But you said something that's super interesting and that was you
realized like you would lay out the facts before, you know, you're very kind of timid about the
vaccine, which even, even me, I ran pro vaccine marketing campaigns that I paid for and made
myself like I was a very big advocate for people getting vaccinated. And even when I got vaccinated,
I was like, Oh God, I've checked everything, right? Like I was even I was even weird, right?
There's just the feets in your head. But you're like, you know, a bit timid towards the vaccine.
But you decided to go with like the facts and information and everything and you got vaccinated.
But and then when you presented this information to your Christian friends, they weren't listening.
You said they weren't listening to the facts. Like they weren't listening to the facts. And
then you thought, well, if they're not listening, like if they don't care about this here,
how do how do I know that they're like they're like, what if their beliefs weren't accurate,
right? Yeah, can you tell us a little bit? That's that's basically, yeah, I was I was seeing how
and I know like everything's not 100% with pharmaceuticals, of course, but like for the
vast majority, like I felt like this was something that I could trust. And
I was just seeing how the people who were kind of
shying, not shying away from it, but screaming the loudest against it and seemingly dying from
COVID tended to be like the right wing conservative slash conspiracy theorists. And I was like,
they're mostly Christians. And there seems to be some kind of connection between that. So
what is the connection? They're all Christians. What are they believing that might not be true
about just Christianity? Like if what are they just blindly believing without looking into it
any deeper? So that sort of is what made me jump into like exploring it even more around that same
time that I was watching other documentaries and and like the one I talked about the purity
culture and stuff. But it really made me examine, what do I believe and why? Because I don't want to
look like these people who are acting so foolish. And that is what basically sparked my
deconstruction slash deconversion without intending it too. So it's like the ridiculous
the ridiculousness of group mentality, right? Like, yeah. And even like, you know, protest the
mandates or whatever, go for it. But the thing is, the thing that I didn't like about the protests
and stuff is like, protest, but you can still do it and accept the science. So protest the mandates,
but social distance when you're protesting and wear masks. But none of them were coughing and
sneezing or whatever everyone they're like, and it's like, it's like, the, you know, it's like,
I'm not anti-vax, I'm anti-mandate. So wear a mask, you dickhead. Like, it's very confusing to
me because it's like, it's so obviously not about the science and not about the, you know,
it's like, if you, you know, you look at any of those anti-vax rallies, I would have no issue
with them if they were, there could have been a way to do them responsibly or credit online
movements or something, you know, even if you had to go out in the street, at least wear a mask or
do something to, yeah. But it was, it was a big pushback against the establishment they thought.
And it was so silly. Exactly. It was very silly. And it was, I don't know if you heard over in
Australia, but like here in Canada from the West Coast to the East Coast, there was a truckers
convoy. Yeah, I heard about that. It was just such an embarrassment. Well, it was just, it was like
truckers going all the way across Canada and people were supporting them and the truckers were
going to save us and everyone was worshiping the truckers and like, yay, the truckers. I don't
know. It was right around when the, they were going to start, you know, kind of like rolling back on
mandates anyways. And so my husband was like, these people are going to think that they actually
did this one really. This is the timeline of how this is all coming to play. And I didn't support
the truckers because it was so stupid. And they just disrupted all of Ottawa for like three weeks
and they were having hot tub parties in the streets. And I'm like, you have, you have freedom.
You're not being arrested. You're blowing on horns 24 hours a day with hot tubs in the middle of the
street and having like dance parties. You have freedoms. Like, what are you shuffling about?
So that's when I started losing like a lot of friends.
It's not great. I can't believe that it comes to this thing. And we'll get off COVID. But there's,
remember, one of the cringiest and saddest and most horrible things I saw local community group
I'm part of. There's like this conspiracy group that like they let, they, you know, I snuck into
to see what the anti-vaccine memes were about. And it's so funny, somebody in my family and
friends are on that group. And I'm like, oh, this is so bad. And they're talking about how like,
I'm like, oh, I saw someone else at church today wearing a bright yellow star star of David on
their jacket. And so it became trendy here to wear a star of David on the jacket as if they were in
Nazi Germany and Hamat. And it was like, they both nodded at each other, these people who were
wearing it at church. Yeah, because it was like, they were kind of saying like, well, I'm unbacked.
So I have to, so I'm, and it's like, you know, typical of a Christian to not sort of rare on
Christians, but typical of a Christian to find any way they can to pretend to be persecuted.
Like it's just, yeah, it's, they got this like, this, this, this, this passion for being persecuted.
Like, how do you know you're talking to a Christian? Yeah, how do you know you're talking to a
Christian? It's like, they're either hoping to be persecuted or they're pretending to be persecuted.
Like, it's, yeah, like, when the same sex marriage bill came around in Australia, I remember a lot
of Christians thought somehow it was an attack on them. Like, they would see a poster that said like,
love is love. And I'm like, does this have to be everywhere? Like, it's like, what are you talking
about? Like, are you kidding me? Like, this is society taking away the big stick that you've
been whacking everyone with for the last 2000 years. This is society taking away that stick.
That isn't persecution. That's just equality. Anyway, I've gotten to the branching stage of
the conversation. Okay. And kiddies and husband coming in. Are they coming in yet? Did you hear
something? Oh, maybe I'll tell them to stay out. No, no, no, they can come in like during the party.
It's all good. So is there anything else you want to talk about with the mental health stuff before
we jump into Q&A? Is there anyone, is there anything you want to talk about? We touched on it.
Yeah, it's no, I think we touched on it. Sorry. Yeah, breaking up again. A little bit, but that's
okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I just saw this comment. It feels so bad. No, that's okay.
Donald Hedges said that's forked up. And it's a, now to stress, David A. Folk was unsurprising
as a supporter of the truckers. Hey, Dr. Kip. That's forked up. That's that made me laugh.
I got, I got, so everyone doesn't know, what's his name? David, David Folk. David A. Folk. He's
the one who's the disgrace. He's the disgrace dude who, who says something about like, Francesca
Stafforda Capullo, that her scholarship is only matters because of her cup size, he said, which
was ridiculous. Like, you like, you shouldn't measure scholarship in cup size. And anyway,
I got, I got, the whole internet came up, came against him because like, no one messes with
Francesca. And, and also what he said was incredibly sexist and ridiculous. But so funny,
I got, I got booted off his, his Twitter because I asked him, I was like, he's like, I need support
because I've lost my job. And I was like, I need to know your cup size before I can go for the job.
So good enough, I can support you. So I've been telling everyone like, I've been, I've been asking
everyone like, what's his cup size? And that's my favorite meme. Okay, so, so I've got a few
questions for you. And these are general questions that I ask people at the end of drinks. What is
the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in? Oh, plausibly, I'll say the flying
spaghetti monster. Okay, why is that plausible? No, I don't know, plausibly true. I don't know,
I've never thought of this question. Yeah, it's good. You can take your time. Possibly true.
Possibly true. You know what, I don't think I wouldn't subscribe to any of them. But
I don't know if there is one that I would think would be plausible and true.
They're knocking on the door. Yeah, I'll say the flying spaghetti monster. Because why not?
Yeah, why not? Also, regarding your, regarding your god belief, what if anything would change your mind?
Um, if there was evidence, but even if there was a god, I know I have the choice that I don't have
to worship him or not. So, even if there was one, I don't think I would worship him.
Yeah, so you can prove that he's there, but I still don't have to worship. So, yeah.
Yeah, I think David said, Canaanite religion for the win. I'd love to, when
Kip comes on, Kip's gonna come on again, hopefully around his 50th, which is coming up,
isn't it, Kip? And we'll have to discuss in detail why the Canaanite god is the
true one true god. Okay. So, and we'll end, I guess, on this question. And this is a really good
question for anyone who maybe has listened to your story, and especially the stuff about your
the mental health journey. What is the best piece of advice someone has given you? And then I'll ask
the follow up to that is, what advice would you have given yourself if you go back in time?
The best piece of advice someone has given me?
I would say, well, my husband, I don't think there's been like one specific piece of advice
that he's given me, but he's just, he's just been such a constant supporter, like,
he's never discouraged me from anything like he's never said, No, I don't think you're right. No,
don't do that. No, like, he's just always supported me in like, whatever I've wanted to explore next.
And I don't, I don't go explore like anything crazy, I don't think.
Eventually, it leads me to the right answers. So I think just having, just having him
being support to me. And that day, where he gave me that quote about life being two sparks,
or life being a spark between two identical voids. That's not really advice, but it was advice
without realizing it. That's good. Yeah, that was huge. And then what I what advice I would give
myself? Yeah, if you go back in time to like, I guess, I guess, when you're deconstructing,
I guess when you're first starting to question things, what would you, what would you say?
Yeah. I think I probably would have told myself, when I first was majorly doubting it
in November of 2019, just to go for it, not to hold back, that it would be okay. It's not,
it's not scary. And to just seek answers outside of Christianity. So that's,
that's what I would tell myself and just know that there's so much more better, better things
waiting on the other side. I've never been happier. The community, the support. It's,
it's, yeah, I never could have imagined it being as wonderful as it is. So just, just to do it.
Yeah. You're not going to regret it.
100%. And, and that's, it's hard to communicate that with people who believe that you're going
to hell or something though. Like you, you like, we try to commit, like Amy was saying, you know,
like, it's hard because we want to tell our family, we're okay, we're good. But
no, no, no, that's almost bad. They want us to be going bad if we're outside of the church, you
know. But yeah, it's, it's, that's probably the same advice, similar advice that I'd give myself,
I think is, is, is, is when I was deconstructing is it's, it's fine. Like it's take, take, and that's
what I always say, like, you know, I might be a orange robe monk with a shaved head in 10 years.
I have no idea. I'm going to enjoy my life up until then. And after then I'm going to like,
enjoying your life is paramount to me in regards to like, don't sweat those, these things just,
you know, beliefs can change. Always follow the evidence where it leads, just keep on down that
path. And it's okay, like enjoy the ride of this beautiful life that we have. I will just to end,
I will say, guys, go check out the stream with me. I am just such an amazing guest. I'm just
kidding. These guys, these guys, we had a blast. It was really, really fun. And of course you,
