At a certain point, I wonder how far apologetics will go to defend their worldview.
An all-powerful God taking seven days to create the earth feels like an oxymoron.
If that God was laying the foundation for the Sabbath, why not just explain the Sabbath?
If that God can command that the Israelites are to keep the Sabbath unto death,
why not command the extinction of slavery?
When an ulterior explanation might be that we were not made in God's image,
but God was made in ours. God didn't make the world in seven days,
but the Hebrews adopted the seven-day week from the Babylonians,
who adopted it from the Sumerians.
