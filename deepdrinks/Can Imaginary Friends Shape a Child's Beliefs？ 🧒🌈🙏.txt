five-year-olds do it with imaginary friends.
But then that same parent that sees their five-year-old
do this with an imaginary friend,
will hear their five-year-old talk about what Jesus told them.
They're like, oh, thank you, Jesus,
you're revealing yourself to my kid.
And it's like, he's capable of believing anything.
Like, and we're the same as adults.
Like, it just, it takes that specialness out
when you really understand the human conditions.
