Welcome to Deep Rings podcast my favorite people on the planet. I love everyone who gets to tune
each week, tune in each week for this. It's my favorite time of the week and we have a few
episodes this week so it's been a bit of a jam-packed week so I hope you guys are enjoying it.
My guest today is Kyla, also known as Not So Eridite, who is a licensed addiction counselor
and psychometrician. She's a content creator who covers gender, dating, relationships, mental health,
education, and social cultural norm psychology and she's a former fundamentalist Christian who is
now a different kind of Christian and today we're going to be discussing the latter part of that.
So I'm very excited to introduce Not So Eridite. Welcome to the show.
Oh, you're muted. Hi, thank you so much for having me.
No worries. We had a couple of mishaps. You've got really sick and now you're even sick now
but you decided like no I'm coming on anyway and I just like to say get behind me Satan.
Yeah, my fundamental parents are like, I actually grew up with my parents being like
never acknowledged that you're sick like if you speak that into like they're like that
intense so I'm fairness I grew up thinking that was fucking stupid and I would always fight with
them on it um because I've always been disagreeable um debate comes to me to be uh but yeah I actually
grew up with my parents being like if I would be like I'm sick they'd be like I renounce that I like
that I you know the name of Christ I renounce that you're sick and that's like yeah I just got cold
like too yeah I we we uh my um counselor he uh at church there obviously there are stronger
stronger believers in in different aspects of uh church and things like that but one of the the um
he knew someone who just died of cancer just randomly just died and it was like they've
been fighting it for like 12 months but they wouldn't tell anyone about it because then
they would be confessing that they had cancer which was against the Kenneth Copeland prosperity
gospel yes kind of type of Christianity essentially I'm glad you know that name yes
do I know that name oh I mean my mom was on um my mom was on welfare I think it was an equivalent
of welfare and she sent him like $500 like believing that it was going to like get her out of the
situation or something like it but here's a big part about growing up I used to watch these cowboy
movies with uh do you remember them with the Kenneth Copeland cowboy movies do you see them
no oh I wish I had a clip I actually bought the DVDs just so I could watch it on stream one time
but um but yeah it's it's it's wild but um so so yeah so it's great great we can finally do this
what are you drinking today I am drinking peat polini so I have like a pre-made bottle that's
almost empty it was just in my fridge when I got home um whoever's watching my dog while I was away
obviously enjoyed themselves so then I also bought a sal blanc and peach juice so I can
that's so good yeah that's so good so I so I initially like we were doing this a while ago
and initially uh you said um mojito mix and I was running around the store looking for like
lime and like yeah mixed and everything for ages and then I was just like they didn't have it and
the guy in the grocery store was like no we don't have and I'm like and then I just came
past this and it's just like mojito mix and I was like that that is so white trash I love it so
I'm just gonna pour my white rum yeah just I'm just gonna put my white rum into the cup I don't
even measure it we're Australian here it is in the middle of the day but um that's acceptable in
Australia and then pour some mojito you guys love drinking anytime Aussies Aussies want to have fun
all time of the day that's true have you been to Australia no I just have a lot of Australian
friends like a lot I don't know what it is but I get along so well with like almost all Australians
that I meet I'm not sure if it's like our Commonwealth background that we can like bond over I just
find Australians are like extroverted and funner Canadians usually so I think it's funny Canadians
I'll take that yeah yeah and I find Canadians are just like a little too introverted which I don't
like so well um well guys uh so what what I want to do first Kyla is I'd like to I'd like to just
jump straight into it so and I'd like you to just tell us a little bit about um like who you were
growing up like what kind of Christian you were and kind of talk about I guess your upbringing
and and journey into fundamentalism and then how that kind of ended for you
uh sure when do I drink when's like the point you can start drinking now I've started drinking now
so yeah okay I'm just allowed to sit like it's not like a drink yeah just sit no no it's only
drink I think that's against TOS but um okay chat we'll do shots I think like otherwise I'll be right
on that but um yeah uh okay so uh how did it get started into fundamentalism I guess I was raised
in it so my parents got saved when I was like one I think so I was and they got saved in Amway
actually I don't know if you know what Amway is it's like yeah yeah yeah marketing that's super
Christian it's like I've saved that yeah apparently I'm really quiet for everyone so I'm just gonna
boost my mic for like one second yeah um you're far in my end but maybe it's because I'm using a
different mic um okay yeah I gotcha I gotcha uh so yeah I I was kind of raised decently fundamental
like my parents got pretty hardcore into it some more like fundamental Christianity right away
probably the most common form of Christianity in Canada is Protestant and Baptist towards non-dom
with varying levels of like if you do you know what the if I use a bunch of words
that are esoteric you know only they are please ask them what they are but there there's a lot
of charismatic Christians so I feel like there's almost two camps of Christianity white Christianity
I should say in Canada which is like the more charismatic Protestants and then the more the
less charismatic the more like traditional Baptist but not Southern Baptist like Methodist
Baptist like more like the Northern States Baptist type so that's kind of the main two forms of
Christianity and then there's little pockets of like Lutherans and Dutch reform but those
are kind of the most popular and I was very my parents are very very charismatic like my mom
took a sword across Canada like two years ago to like pray for a revival or something like that and
she like had like a literal prayer sword that she would like stab into the earth and stuff they're
very intense so symbolic kind of thing like we used to I think I grew up in a very similar
type of Christianity but I was one of the people kind of leading not leading but but I was one of
the I was one of the fringes of my church and I was trying to push those things kind of further
with with a group of people in my youth pastor and and we would go up to the top of of a mountain
near where I live and we would reclaim the territory for for God you know I mean we would
take back the enemy's territory and I remember there was an adult shop that shut down like sex
toy shop that shut down in our town and I was like aha I was like it worked I was like the devil
has he he's strong but turns out they were just doing renovations to expand it so so I was like
oh we need to get back up to the mountain so um so you grew up in that when did when did things
kind of change for you um so my parents are still fundamentalists um and I grew up fundamentalist
and I had a lot of fundamental beliefs but I also was like atypical um because I've always been
pretty disagreeable and pretty I guess like free thinking like I I'm not the type to
follow the peer pressure it's kind of like what we would say um I tend to want to think about
things on my own and decide on my own so um my my brother actually came out as gay when I was 19
um which was not a shock to me at all and he was actually super active in our church at the time
um he volunteered like probably 200 hours a month um and they just like dropped him
uh he just like disappeared and nobody seemed to care and I like really I just really threw
my faith and so I think after that I kind of it was around the same time where I was getting more into
um university and just thinking about things I'm really pro-science so starting to learn about
evolution and so I kind of like took my faith from like the bottom up where I had to be like
do I even believe in God and then if the answer is yes to that what does that mean like it doesn't
have to be a Christian God so I started researching a bunch of other religions and just like ways that
people engage in spirituality um and so I kind of had to do like my faith from like the bottom up
at 19 um starting with the question of do I believe God exists basically um so yeah that's
that's kind of the nutshell of how that got um kind of like shattered and since then it's been
a lot of okay well I do think there's a God I do think it's like a Judeo like a monotheistic or I
guess you could say tri-theistic it's depending on like the labels you want to attach there um but
I'm not a fundamentalist I think like I'm not I'm not any of the solas I'm not solo scripture or
any of those things so I'm like a Protestant because I'm protesting the Catholic church but
theologically and closer to Catholics for the most part um so yeah I'm just kind of a mod podge
there it's hard to even use labels because not because I'm like I'm above labels but any label
that I give myself is gonna probably give you the wrong the wrong image of like what I believe
which is why for a long time I was like I'm like a Christian that other Christians wouldn't accept
uh because most Protestants would probably say I'm not saved for example because I'm not solo
scripture uh stuff like that so yeah I actually noticed that when when doing a deep dive into
your content I watched a lot of your discussions about God the ones I could find the ones you
sent me and I still have so many questions uh and I feel like it's not not necessarily um because
it's you have a very you seem to have a very matured uh I guess intellectually honest version
of Christianity um at least that's what I can see from the outside uh and and I just it's it's
interesting to me because a lot of the same so for your audience for those who don't know me I was
a Pentecostal youth pastor I spoke in tongues I laid on in the pans I did the all that and now I'm
an agnostic atheist I don't I don't believe um but for me my my deconstruction process well
I guess you kind of deconstructed but it wasn't away from the faith you just kind of deconstructed
your faith and but for me my deconstruction led me to uh I went to okay how how do we determine
a realistically true like a true worldview like what what do we do to determine what's true and
what's not there's a there's a quote by uh I don't know if you know Matt Delahunty um he says
you know I want to believe as many true things and as little false things as possible and that
became kind of came a bit of my mantra so what I did because I I grew up you were young as creationist
like do you believe you know as the magical zoo boat and like yeah yeah yeah yeah we have this
connect we have this connection that no one else will understand unless they've also been the
younger creationist like did you know that carbon dating is a lie you know yeah yeah exactly yeah
yeah I love I think yeah it's so funny you bring up like the god delusion or something like that
and people go carbon dating is like he doesn't even mention that in the book like he doesn't
like well not that I remember anyway like it's like such a non part of it all yeah but um
but yeah so I so for me I kind of looked at uh my my Christian worldview and I kind of
like the and you know this stuff way more than me so I'll I'll try to explain it with my small
brain you use big brain to kind of interpret it for your audience okay but but essentially
well not a scholar by any means but you know you know brains are right you like psychology
oh neuroscience yeah neuroscience yeah so like I had you know my god belief was attached to all
these smaller beliefs and these these smaller beliefs were like prayer works um the bibles
inerrancy um the family tradition um my social social structures that it's very hard to change
if everyone around you is a certain way if I grew up in Afghanistan I'd probably be a Muslim if I
grew up in you know the south of the US I'd probably be a conservative Christian um you know and I
kind of looked at those things and I tried to break down each one one at a time and go okay is
there good reason to believe these things um and I kind of came to the conclusion that I didn't have
sufficient evidence to warrant belief on any of them in which case it was a very heartbreaking and
like painful uh experience for me but I had to just admit well then if that if that's the case
like logically I don't have a good reason to believe in God emotionally I still feel those
warm feelings I still like have this yearning I guess for something bigger but intellectually
I have to admit I have to tell the truth I don't have any good reasons but you seem to go through
that process or a similar process and you and well I imagine you find good reasons so you have
reasons to uh believe what you believe um I would like to know obviously
so first of all should I bring Andrew in and he can um he can tell you his version of Christianity
that uh what is well what's his name sick uh Andrew Wilson Eastern Orthodox no the uh big
papa fascist dude or is that oh yeah yeah he's he's uh he's fun smokes more cigarettes than um
I don't know but so yeah yeah yeah would you say so first of all I got a question
this has just turned into a therapy session for me now when I'm breaking down those smaller
smaller things is that like is that typical of like how someone would I guess engage with their
belief systems or is that am I doing it a bit more a bit differently like is that is that how
beliefs kind of work in someone's psychology or do you know about that sorry so when you're saying
like the way that you deconstructed your faith is that common or is that atypical is that what you're
asking yeah yeah um I mean it sounds pretty common um I don't know of psychology I've
had not read a ton of psychology specifically on like deconversion stuff um so definitely appeal
to somebody else over this but I would I would immediately go back to like existential therapy
and like CBT theory which is like we have kind of three primary things that inform us about the
world so our view of self our view of others and our view of the world and our faith is obviously
our view of informs our view of self our faith informs our view of others and our faith informs
our view of the world so if you're like deconstructing the faith you have to extract it from all three
of your most core stabilizing beliefs and existential therapy for example we say that
people need to come into therapy when like one of these legs of the stool get kicked out whereas
if you're deconverting all three of your legs kind of get kicked out like you're in this deeply
destabilized ouch position at that time and so um it sounds like the way that you deconstructed I
would say like more like nature would probably have like more to say about the process by which
you did that um I think the way that people wrestle with letting go of their faith is probably very
different it sounds like you're very intellectual so probably part of the way that you coped and
managed through that major identity shift is through some level of like intellectualization
whereas it sounds like so mostly I still have that pull a little bit sounds like there might
there could or could not be some emotional work that's still like attaching you that maybe you
have or have it done so I don't know if that really answers your question well but um that's
like the way I think it does in that with the um intellectual I'm I'm not a smart man but I know
what love is that's my favorite quote but um I have you know the reference but but essentially
like I can't I my fundamentally I believe that the best way to determine what's likely true or not
is through an intellect through rational thought logic reason um not through like faith or hopes
and dreams um so so that's why I try and when I'm thinking of like as my worldview I try and think
in those terms so I'm interested in maybe you can convince me maybe I haven't come a Christian
one of the reasons you have for for your beliefs still in god like where did you go when you when
you're first building your faith back up again so this is my favorite line to give questions
especially is I say the church almost drove me away from my faith and evolution class drove me back
into it um so learning about evolution has got to be like if I I wish I could get degrees in
everything but especially evolutionary science I love evolution I think it's fascinating I like
animals I like taxonomy like even the really boring taxonomy where you have to like identify which
like skeletal structures belong to like the broad like group and kingdom I think that shifts
back like finding out whales have fingers was so cool I was like oh my god that's crazy yeah
because I have like finger bones they just like are elongated and weird and have
your mic I think has gotten a bit too close to your mouth and it's like clipping a little bit
is that better yeah that's better that's good okay sorry um so my faith came back into ways so
one was I every time I left it was like 8 a.m. it's the worst class ever it was super early and
my prof was really cool actually so he started out the class talking about a whole bunch of theories
about how the earth came to be he talks about penspermia I don't know if you know the theory of
penspermia um it's kind of like aliens basically like loaded up a meteor full of basically like
life juices and blasted it off but the question with penspermia is like who made the original
intelligent life form and so penspermia becomes a problem of like nascent essentially um and he
talked about creationism and he talked about evidence for creationism and then he talked about
evolution and so I like spent a lot of time actually talking to this professor afterwards
and I was like just you know like I'm a Christian but I'm really I was like clear I was like I'm in
this state of my faith we're like I don't know if I'm going to be a Christian by the end of this
class and he was like well just so you know evolution isn't talking about your faith at all
they're just like we're not talking about metaphysics like your faith in your belief system
is unrelated to science I give you believe in god then you should believe in a god that's able to
like create science um and he's like and to be honest there are a couple of things that good
creation scientists do have as like some level of evidence and he's like just pay attention to that
and at the end of the day he's like I'm not here to convince you your faith one way or the other
I just want you to be open to learning um he's brilliant love that professor he was like this
cool cowboy professor who came in to like he was like a cowboy biologist I don't know if you've
ever met biologists that dress like cowboys yeah okay he was for sure like 100% that archetype
like if he could come in smoking a cigar and like sipping whiskey I think he would have like if he
was allowed to for sure like Jurassic Park slash um what's the other um Indiana Jones style like
yeah a little eccentric but like super cool and like seems like maybe maybe two wise he's either
fucking crazy or like wiser than we then will ever know and there's no in between um and so
yeah every time I would like listen to like the Cambrian explosion I would get like these
goosebumps being like either this happened just by accident or I'm watching some sort of infinite
god paint a fucking masterpiece and that's pretty cool either way like this is great like the Cambrian
explosion I don't know if you know what's about evolution I don't need to nerd out too hard it's
insane it's so cool so if we put like the years and I no longer younger okay I believe the earth is
like three to four billion years old I updated my science if we put like the earth's time lapse
on a 24 hour scale the Cambrian explosion is what every single major bodily structure that we know
that is alive today so insects all these things came to be it happened in like less than like
I think it's like less than like two seconds or something it's literally like a blip that's why
we call it the Cambrian explosion it's just kind of like there was nothing there's just like some
protobions and some bacteria and some like algae like flipping around and then just suddenly we had
like multi cellular structure complex beings that were the beginning grounds of what later became
like whales and all sapiens and dogs and like all sorts of shit right crazy and we we have no idea
why we don't know why just suddenly their ocean was like and time to have birth like we don't we
don't know we don't know right and so that's where like that's where like the faith piece comes in
room like I can see that being god I could see that being luck I just fundamentally believe in god
and the reality is like the god of the gaps question everyone has to believe in something
a little bit right you have to believe it's just random chance and I'm believing that like there's
an intelligent intelligent creator like doing this and when it comes to things like Cambrian
explosion or like the eukaryotic flagella I think it's this is where like when we have these gaps
it's like maybe my faith will be eroded over time but I don't know what I fill into these spaces and
this isn't the only thing that connects me of god obviously um yeah of course I uh I had a very
similar the more I like watch your stuff I'm like fuck there's so much similarities between
our thought processes and things because when I started learning about evolution
as well I I almost got teary in some moments like it felt spiritual like it was it was like
I looked at my dog and I was like we have a beagle and I was like you've survived like
three points something billion years of evolution like and we just cut your nuts off
gone like 3.4 billion years of surviving
I know you're tiny but it's like you look at parts you're like oh it's a tragic line
has survived for 3.4 billion years I have a long it is and then we just like ended it because we
didn't want to con we wanted the convenience of like that is wild to me that is so wild to me
but like looking at like you know entire species that we've never even seen like trial species of
trilobites and you just go like this was here way before humans ever were and it was in continued
and it's just there and like they died they lived and died and we didn't even notice like
it's it's crazy and it made me feel really connected to things in fact it actually informed
a lot of my vegetarian like I became a vegetarian at that stage because I started to think
more about animals I'm not necessarily a vegetarian anymore but I was a vegetarian for
like six years um but it was yeah it was for me it was like a really like it was like a holy
shit like the life is so much bigger than I thought it was not just like 6 000 years ago
god like zapped a few animals into existence made some humans like it just it actually was
more beautiful it was it was more awe-inspiring it was uh it was incredible um it's something you
said there um and I asked you beforehand if I could push back and you said yes you like you like it so
like happy to engage but the um when you said that I guess everyone has to have faith in something
you said something that I agreed with and then you immediately said something that I didn't
agree with so you said that we don't know why the Cambrian explosion just exploded why there's all
this life form that just like um all these uh vertebrae and you know different things and you
can say it more intelligently than I can but we don't know why that's the case uh and then you
go on to say so like for you that's god for you that's why like god did that right or like that's
that god is behind that and for me I don't necessarily think it's a random chance uh but
I go um I my answer is I we don't know I just I just stay at that I don't know I don't know
why it happened what do you think about doing that and just leaving a gap there like for like
abiogenesis people go where did you know kent hoven I'm not sure if you know who kent hoven is
um but you know where where did life come from that's the the first evolution of biology of
life or whatever and it's like where did that come from it well I don't know I don't know the
answer of that there's some really interesting concepts but but I but I have to stay at I don't
know at this stage I can't feel it with I can't say it was random chance because like that like if
you look at statistically that that's quite unlikely as well but then I can't say god the same way I
can't say fairies did it like how like how what do you think about that what do you think about
just stopping there yes that's where um william james became really essential for me um because I
think that that's a religious experience that you wrote the fund uh the something of religious
experience a will to believe oh okay okay I don't know yes uh he gets like a stanford public speech
basically called a will to believe um and he talks about this idea of essentially skeptics
cynics and believers um and I'm not sure if you're familiar with william james he's one of the
fathers of psychology um that he's also really into spiritualism um even though he was a founder of
a bunch of major mathematical like he's a brilliant genius and yeah he wrote into spirituality loved
witches that witches were so cool um yeah he wrote the varieties of religious experience which I've
tried to read like four times and I just can't get through it just yeah it's so dense but yeah yeah
he's so smart he's a crazy smart guy he literally was just a mathematician and he's like I'd rather
make my own field and then just fucking made psychology like that's william james like this guy
is brilliant and odd and that's what's kind of interesting to me it feels like a lot of people
I know who like maintain their faith if they're intellectually honest I have to be like kind of
this weird eccentric scientist type like I don't know if you know this Andrew Huberman is actually
it's a neuroscientist he's a very acclaimed neuroscientist and he's actually a christian as
well uh he believes in god um he doesn't believe in god in like the protestant kind of way he's
gonna be a little bit more like I am um but yeah he absolutely believes in a judaeo christian god
which a lot of people don't know about him um and so in a will to believe he talks about basically
this question of I don't know and so he says sometimes the only way to get evidence for
your belief is to act on it first so he's he gives this example of a train robbery in the
in a train car and he says there's no logic by which that should work there's three guys
robbing the train and there's like 50 people in this fucking train there's no world that they
should be able to take control of 50 people like 50 people can just rise up and take on these three
guys it there's no logic the problem is that not a single train car passenger has faith in the
passenger beside them whereas these three guys all have faith in each other however if one guy believed
that the people around him would stand up with him and fight against him the only way he would
have evidence that they would do so is to stand up first and then hope and pray to god that they
stand up with him and so he talks about this idea essentially you know this question of I don't know
we deal with it all the time like he says like do these skeptics never rise from bed because we
don't quite know where gravity comes from and you're afraid that one day you'll put your feet
down and gravity won't be there he says no of course not we don't ever act this way and I love
William James because he's a functionalist and so he says like part of how I try to understand
the world is functionality right so I always acknowledge I could be wrong about my god thing
I could be completely wrong that I don't know gap that I'm filling with god could just be fucking
horseshit the issue is that functionally it seems that religion keeps emerging over and over again
it seems to be the case that having faith has benefited my life prayer has benefited my life
I do feel like I have a personal relationship with god and so to some degree the only way that I can
essentially find evidence for my belief is because I keep stepping out in faith in it and that doesn't
mean that if you step out in faith and he doesn't show up that that's like not god that's like a deeply
interpersonal dynamic that I have between god but for me we don't functionally act and like
I'll just stay at I don't know almost ever I think we always fill it with something
and the issue is like most people fill it with it's probably random chance they could be wrong
and I'm saying it's probably god but I could be wrong and I think that's the most intellectually
honest way to engage for me there is so many different angles that we could start our own
podcasts and just talk for every year and not get to the bottom of just this conversation
there is so much that I want to like directions I could take this but because I guess you're a
I'll use one example because you a licensed addiction counselor one of the things that I
learned I've had it's a bit of a long story well I've been around NA and AA meetings a lot
my dad was also an alcoholic but one of the things that I found really interesting is the
concept of higher power in the 12-step systems a lot of the time people's high power is god but
some of the time people have real problems with god and so I've heard people say that their god
or their high power is a truck because a truck can drive past seven bottle shops a day and not go
into one of them and he can't do that so that's a high power or I've heard people have high powers
that are the universe or something else and when I was in part when I was deconstructing my faith
I was testing prayer I struggle with anxiety panic attacks and sometimes and I've got OCD
or pure OCD and and I was having these a really bad night and I decided to pray
when I was in the process of deconstructing to try and remove my anxiety asking that it
will be removed by the next morning and instead of praying to god I thought to myself hang on
I'm gonna pray to something else and I prayed to a jug of milk or I might have been to myself
I might have said David I pray that you know got that you'll remove the anxiety tomorrow morning
the next morning I woke up feeling like on top of the world I felt like incredible I felt awesome
I went to work I totally forgot I said the prayer and everything and halfway through the day I
remembered oh wait like I was having such a great day and I was like wait I prayed last night to a
jug of milk and I thought and I was like if I prayed to god this would have been evidence to me
of god's miraculous power that he healed me of some anxiety or calmed me or gave me shalom
uh so I guess my question would be under that system that you're kind of describing wouldn't
that be like that you kind of pray or you step out in faith and things happen wouldn't that then
mean that I have evidence that I have an omniscient jug of milk that is helping me in my day to day
life let's say I kept doing it and it kept producing the same results would that be evidence that
the jug of milk is omniscient and protective and I mean to some degree long term it might be if every
single time you pray to it it does actually fix all your problems to be honest that would be some
evidence for something right like if I'm being super honest like intellectually honest I guess I
would say um so yeah sort of the issue is like basically I guess my response would be this is
where the I don't know comes into there's a part of your brain that is distinctly reactive to the
religious experience it's the right hemisphere and so when nuns experience like a moment with God
for example and we throw them in the MRI this part kind of this temporal lower part of their
brain just lights up like crazy and what's interesting is that we seem to be able to induce
this through hallucinogens as well hallucinogens kind of light up a whole bunch of your brain but
it really does seem to have this and every single person who has that part light up reports having
a spiritual experience and so there's this complicated question of okay well we evolved as
creatures to have this part of our brain that reacts to religiosity that's clear it like there's
there's something to do about the fact that religion emerges universally just like language
does and just like music does that means something that means something deeply fundamental about
homosexuality but it doesn't mean God's real it could just mean that religious beliefs are
necessary to like aggregate more than 250 homo sapiens in one spot and any successful large
group of homo sapiens all evolve this capacity to have like a religious experience the problem is
that again we go to this like I don't know space is it possible that it evolves so that like the
most competitive homo sapiens evolve this religious part of their brain to react so that
they could basically be connected to each other in a unique way or did God put that
and like evolve that into us so that like he had a specific part of our brain that is reacting to
him because he's got the God of science and the God of everything else and the question the problem is
hard to know especially because we haven't found like a homo sapien that we can test with a brain
to see if they don't have that religious section right if there was a really paleolithic homo
sapien that didn't have that religious section in their brain that was dead that would potentially
be evidence of the first but we don't have that at least technologically right now and so again
like that God of the gaps comes in where I basically say like at the end of the day
I can't help but believe this thing but I understand when people don't I understand
like yeah but it would just be like this religious silk and it's just meditation and stuff I'm like
yeah but for me like you're always like there's been too many uncanny things that keep happening in
my life that it would be it would be kind of weird for me to not like to not believe in God
but I understand if you don't that's like your walk in your relationship at the end of the day
hmm do I don't and I don't know I truly don't know the answer to this do have
I tested psychedelics on animals probably um but I don't know if we've looked at religious
responsibility in animals as close as yeah and they can't report it so there's gonna be issues
so I'm cutting together a kind of highlight reel for the 100 episodes because you're the 99th
you're the 99th episode on deep drinks get nine own problems but not having Kyler on isn't one
nice there we go and all the fun though yeah two in two days of doing the 100th episode I'm
cutting together like some of my favorite moments and one of them was when I interviewed my wife
actually and this is the first time she told me she wasn't a Christian on on on the stream
I was like well this is okay uh well she like verbalized it and she said that the exact same
experiences that she had at church she has at a musical she loves musicals she goes and sees
wicked like she's seen wicked like 10 times as ridiculous like I like how much she sees that
maybe uh and she said they they were the exact same feelings that she experienced at the musical
that she experienced at church now I wonder like if have you have you seen that debate between Jordan
Peterson and Matt DeLahunty where Jordan Peterson kind of says that you can't give up smoking unless
you have a mystical experience through psychedelics and that's like evidence have you seen that I've
heard Jordan Peterson talk about the study about like the religious experience and yeah yeah so so
the problem I guess I guess this is kind of a a cup for the horse kind of thing because like how do
you define religious experience beyond so like was my wife having religious religious experiences
at musicals or was she not having religious experiences at church and I've seen my wife at
church crying on her knees um you know looking very much like a religious experience that everyone
else around was having and then she's now she's saying that well she had similar experiences
at musicals uh like I guess if the musicals that she was going to were a religious ceremony
of some sort she may say that those experiences like someone from the outside might say that was
the religious experience or for example someone goes and sees the Beatles back in the day the
girls would pass out that faint you know they'd see the the Beatles and faint was that a religious
experience that was done in a church the pastor walked in and the and people started fainting
that's the Holy Spirit moving amongst the church moving with the the power of the pastor so I wonder
when it comes to religious experience and the evolution of I guess our brains to have these
these things and ask for us to ask the question why are we kind of not just putting the cup for
the horse like why do we have we don't ask the same questions for things like why do we feel or
why do we experience love why do we what we do with love but why do we experience as well I mean
I don't know we do yeah we ask all these questions positive psychology is obsessed with
awe obsessed with it study all the time yeah so so what's the difference between awe and
like a religious experience like is in the brain they seem to be super closely linked I don't know
if I've looked at studies at awe and religious experiences themselves it seems like awe is
everything I can understand people reported that's basically like a less religious experience but I
don't know what part of the brain it's going to be triggering necessarily um as far as I call
goes I just have to read the literature it's possible that it happens in the like right
temporal lobe for sure I wouldn't be surprised that it happened somewhere on the right hemisphere
uh that would make sense for me um I don't know I'm not full of scripture so for me I'm like
why can't god be moving in like all of these spaces like why why isn't it possible that like
because you're willing to have faith like he responded or perhaps like all that you needed
to learn in that moment was to believe in something outside of yourself right and so like
this is the issue this is the issue with metaphysical claims I can come up with an answer for god
for everything and this is why I'm willing to have these conversations but I'm not going to pretend
that it's going to convince you and I'm not trying to process it yeah yeah no and I'm watching that
yeah yeah like I can give you a million reasons it's like well it's possible that this was going
on it's possible that god was like asking this way CS Lewis has this great line of like who do
how do we not know that somebody's engaging in the like way that is like so close to god
that like god is honoring it and it's like who are we to limit how god wants to act in people's
lives um who are we to say that like just because you're not worshiping god but you're just having
a Beatles experience that god wants to somehow like limit you from experiencing like this moment
of reverence and connectivity to other human beings if he's like put that in us what what what
what makes us believe that god would be like that could only happen in this fucking stiff ass church
with like shitty music you know like why would that be the case necessarily like if somebody's
engaging in worship at their ex at like highest peak of excellence isn't that to some degree like
worship and praise because it's like that's what god it you know theoretically designed them to be
and when they're doing this music at their peak and everyone's enjoying it like that's exactly what
god wants for humans and so I could give you all these reasons and part of why I've been like hesitant
to is like none of them are going to be compelling because at the end of the day metaphysical claim
and it's an interpersonal dynamic and so I think at the end of the day you kind of have to decide
for yourself like this is why I'm very like it's just your journey I can answer mine and you can
be dissatisfied with it and that's okay because I'm really happy I'm like everything that's happened
to me you know I haven't had skin milk moments but I've had moments where I was like hey god
if you don't show up like today right now I'm out and then this like random old lady would come up
to me like hey I know you've never met me I'm super sorry to introduce you but I just wanted
to like I felt like God was telling me that you needed to know that he loved you until I give you
this hug and it asked God to tell me that he loved me in a physical way literally a second before
and so like I hugged maybe it's just the omniscient skin milk but maybe it's God and the reality is
like it just makes sense right now for me to believe that it's God and I just keep I keep having
experiences like this to the point that like the reality is like I don't know if there's much
of a take me away from my faith because I'm just so satisfied in it that's like yeah yeah even if
it's not literally true it's so functionally true for me at this point that like yeah and which is
why I'm like very okay like you know you're on your journey do your thing I disagree yeah also
that's your no that's and that's totally that's that's totally cool I think most people like don't
change belief systems they I think most people change belief systems for and you can correct me
if I'm wrong actually because you probably know but people change their belief system not because
of evidence or but because something outside of their um they control I guess kind of like for
okay for me I had a a gay friend who was being ostracized ostracized by the church first episode
of deep drinks actually he was closeted for 45 years and came out and everything
I met him in ministry college and so we started looking at scripture together and that was a
big catalyst for me and getting very angry with how the church was treating treating things
to do with the lgbt community that that was like a really strong motivating factor for me and then
I also had a very strong interest in science if I didn't have an interest in science and like I
wasn't like inspired by science and I didn't have that friend I might still be in the church like
it's not like someone could come to me come and present to me evidence usually and I think this
is where the angry atheist type comes in it's like someone hurt you got you know you've been hurt by
by god and now you hate god and it's like that's not true but there's also probably some truth to
that where like where like the need I don't know it feels like there needs to be a catalyst for
change like it needs to be a reason why someone would change maybe you move to a new country
maybe you're changing your identity maybe like I don't know who knows so this is this is where
when everyone says like I'm I'm all I care about is like the rationale and intellectualism this is
where like my dbt training immediately comes out where I'm like that's very rare actually very few
people are only pulled away from faith because they're exclusively intellectual qualms it's almost
always some sort of emotional qualm that triggers the need to look into it and then they're emotionally
intellectually dissatisfied as a result and I think that's because dbt would say that's because
a wise mind recognizes that both intellectual and emotional realities are real and they matter
right that it's this piece of like there's some things that are going to be capital T true that
we can kind of only know at an emotional level and we don't really have like a good intellectual
explanation for it but we do know that's true and I think that that's a key part of wisdom
there's some really interesting research on then people shutting down like the left hemisphere
which is like the traditional like logic but most importantly the left hemisphere for most
people's are languages and languages both this incredible generative gift and this deeply restrictive
thing as well because then we're limited to think about the world and the way that our language
conveys it and so when you shut that part of the brain down you can start showing people images
and stuff like that and the way that they understand and react to it I can't quote all of it if there's
a book on it I'm trying to remember the book it's been so long since I read it but it's fascinating
to see how like our emotional kind of non-conscious brain picks up on things has hunches about stuff
that is fucking 100 correct it's really it's really really interesting to kind of understand this like
non-conscious emotional side and to realize like wisdom and intellectualism comes from both it can't
just be one or the other you're missing half a puzzle if you're just only intellectual and I'm not
saying that's that's you necessarily but most of these things that we come to decide on is
necessarily both emotional and intellectual and that's good we've kind of like coped ourselves
into thinking that intellectualism is like all that matters in North America and it's just kind
of like cringe when nobody's ever believed that like for all of human history it's a really weird
thing well um if you don't mind so would you say that your experience with like asking for you know
god to show up then and there um and I'm going to pull myself some more Bacardi as well um some more
what I'll call as well um but would you say that that was like one of the most influential
experiences uh for you in in kind of convincing you of god's uh belief like yeah that was the one
that made me go okay I'm willing to accept that there's god at least for now yeah there's been
other experiences since then like every time it's basically every time I've been at like a pretty
crux moment in my life there's been something that happens that's interpersonally and like at an
anecdotal personal level just too much for me to walk away like through I was like if I'm being
intellectually honest I probably shouldn't I probably should be a Christian because I just
keep having these things happen exactly when I need to and I know that that doesn't happen for
other people and so a lot of people hear that and they're like fuck you Kyla and it's like I don't
want to tell you but keep having them it would be weird for me to be like no way to go you know
and I'm sorry that you're not I don't I don't know the difference I'm not going to sit here and be
like it's because you're a bad Christian I'm like I don't I don't know any of that shit I'm not going
to tell you what how god does and works I'm not interested in that yeah I could put on my atheist
fedora which I've never owned a fedora but I think I should and go you know very edged lord
atheist on you and be like tell ask god right now what you would need to tell me to convince me of
god's existence pray right now and ask me you know and and if god knows what will convince me
you should be able to tell me something but I'm not going to do that um well even though I just
kind of did but I'm not gonna do that what I'm what I am gonna ask though is let's say that like
someone came into this conversation maybe it was Andrew no I'm getting maybe it was I just saw
that debate you do it it was so you're such a douchebag but someone comes in this conversation
and they can explain to you with natural reasoning like a naturalistic perspective about why these
things happened maybe there's a pheromone you're squirting out that that made someone oh I need to
tell Kyla that she's loved let's say like some scientists could do this uh would that lower
your belief in god probably not at this point now okay yeah uh 10 years ago yes now probably not
it's the same way like in my like it's like if I told you why you love your husband is because
of like these simple factors and I could like recreate it in a lab I'd be like you probably
couldn't and also that's just not what love is love isn't just like oxytocin proximity and like
all these things like there's also magic to it and yeah basically so so um uh and if this is
getting too deep and we let me know but if so if that's not the case if that's the case of that it
would have convinced you 10 years ago but it wouldn't convince you now what what would you say the
main reasons are for your belief now and if this is too personal we can move on but uh it's essentially
like this extremely close personal relationship that I feel like I have uh with god um it feels
like there are moments where I pray and I get really clear answers um that have been really
really targeted at key private issues um whether that's from somebody else uh there's been I kind
of like have the the view of like you should have three witnesses for things so like a personal one
like I feel like god said this and then somebody else that you haven't told this to kind of confirming
the same thing and then somebody who doesn't know you unrelated confirming the same thing I've had
those sort of instances happen often enough at this point that um yeah I just I guess I was gonna say
if god came down I was like just so you know I ain't real um I don't know it's like to me like
there's always going to be this realm that we call magic that's like the the infinite unknown
and and somewhere in there god fits um and I'm okay with that because I think it's functional if
nothing else um but also it's meaningful for me it's like deeply deeply meaningful it gives me
a lot of joy that's super interesting because you just said if god came down or like it couldn't
be god because that would this like it doesn't work but like I see more on it yeah ancient
lizard alien overlord came down and said god's not real you would still kind of believe because
of these it's like who made you yeah yeah so um interesting because like like I've said like like
like I said at the start um I've had experience I've spoken in tongues I've had really tremendous
experiences praying crying um seeing visions you know things that I can't explain I I'm at the spot
where I don't deny those experiences I just don't deny the attachment to that experience so I'll
give you an example I've given this example a million times for my audience I'm sorry but you
know I'm a I grew up a Christian but when I went to Bali I decided to read the Bhagavad Gita
because it's the Hindu island and I was like I want to learn about Hinduism so I was reading the
Bhagavad Gita I'm three three or four cocktails deep next to a pool bar with my wife and I've got
my headphones in there's techno blaring the background so I'm hearing like and then I'm
hearing this like and then Arjun I said to Krishna like I'm hearing that in my my audio uh and it
got to chapter nine and it was so profound it felt like a religious experience like I it was like
I am the wood and the flame that consumes it I am the beginning and the end and I'm not sure if
you read the Bhagavad Gita but chapter nine like blew me away if I was uh if I was didn't have
hang-ups about religious experience I would have called that a religious experience I was said that
Krishna met me or like or the the Hindu gods met me or I found peace in that book I can kind of get
on the same page if you're saying that those experiences is kind of what you're calling God
is that what you're saying you're saying that like see I separate the experiences from
I say I've had those experiences I'm not sure what they are and you're saying I've had those
experiences that's God is that what you're saying um well like I've had those experiences and it's
convinced me that it is God and I'm content either way yeah okay interesting yeah sorry yeah okay well
well let me ask you about Christianity then let me ask you about your idea of Krishna because
we're running out of time this has been really easy to talk to you um so you mentioned just a
second ago that you need three witnesses you need yourself someone else and and uh sorry I forgot the
third one someone unrelated to you so like someone else include like a friend but like friends are
going to be biased some security somebody unrelated to you yeah that has no reason to know
where do you get is that just a is that a biblical um idea or is that something that you got from
somewhere else yeah yeah it's a biblical idea God now I can't remember where it's from uh I'm sure
I can google you're a real christian you don't even memorize the whole bible it actually comes from
like my funny land I just feel like it's a good I like threes I like threes for everything so like
even non-religiously like before I confront a friend on an issue for example I wait for three
examples of it happening I just think three is a solid number um there is some like religious
stuff for it but the reason why they picked threes in part because three like is an
meaningful number to the Hebrew people so yeah yeah 100% um so I guess I could fight it in the
bible though it is no that's fine that's fine there's I'm not like I'm not going to suck quiz
in you on bible stuff but but I guess my question is some Old Testament stuff that's where it comes
from yeah and there's a reason video games I used to be a video game an indie game developer um I
never developed anything amazing but I taught video games and three is a huge thing you know
you attack a boss three times a third time is always the one that kills them um but so
I'm kind of confused where you stand on what parts of the bible are literal or true and what parts
are not because yeah you see and excuse me for sounding again putting on my athis fedora but
it's like you're just picking and choosing what parts of the bible you accept and what you don't
I know that you're more intelligent than that so explain to me what how do you
that's a that's a point of saying it I know you have a greater reasoning
and behind that so what what what parts of the bible do you accept and what what don't you accept
so I accept all parts of the bible I just don't take them as like
soulless scripture as far as like for example I understand that there's a very important
cleave between ceremonial law and moral law I understand that I understand what the second
covenant represents I'm a christian not an orthodox jewish person so the second covenant is
essential to my faith um god the simple answer is exegesis isegesis is a divine revelation but
that means nothing to anyone so um the way so if you want to know how I read the bible
it's super complex so typically I'm aware that we don't have the original transcripts of almost
anything and I'm also aware that uh people are notorious especially scribes are notorious for
changing the words so part of what I do is textual criticism so I look at different scholars so
typically I look at a combination of uh jewish scholars secular scholars and then some sect of
christianity scholars oftentimes catholics and what they say about a text and what they what the
textual criticism of it what they think was originally trying to be god at here and then I
also look for emergent themes across passages because if I believe that like god kind of is this
moving I kind of you god is like this ultimate philosophy king who's been like kind of moving
and shaping and like pulling humans closer and closer to what he actually believes is goodness
um and he made a lot of grace for us back when we were like psychotic barbarians and mostly animals
and he's like you know narrowing up what is okay and what's sin and what's not sin as we kind of
learn it to some degree on our own and and are ready for it um and then I'll also do like exegesis
I'm gonna like look at the text itself I'm gonna look at what the critics think that text means
what the words were there what it means to both the culture what the word actually we believe was
any arguments about like what could have been done so for example there's a number of texts
that I know were probably added and most biblical scholars agree like aren't part of the bible so
one example would be the story of like the woman um that's in adultery right most biblical scholars
agree that that wasn't in the original script um and so what I take as authority is going to be like
emergent themes um that seem to keep repeating and seem directed towards what is good um essentially
um and so yeah go ahead um is is so is um sorry I just got distracted by digital
in the church that's dr. joshwell and he's a seriologist um but um so when it comes to like
do you know do you know much about marcian of sonope mm-hmm yeah yeah okay so what do you
this is so great I don't like you just know so easy to have a conversation with you
so what do you take what what is your perspective on his take where he's like the god of christianity
has nothing to do with the old testament god like the god christian yeah you know I mean like
he's like for example let me you know the idea of god that you're painting for me is this god that
tells you that he loves you that he comes up and you know um someone comes up and says that hugs
you and says that you know he's so harsh I'm not like a super hyper liberal okay he's harsh as well
like there there is such a sin and stuff it's just I don't talk about sin a lot because most people
that I talk to are atheist and to be honest like in my religious view we're spiritually dead I don't
really care well the issue is like why would I care about the sin of an atheist like you're not
even saying yeah like sin is about this dynamic between you and god if you don't even believe in
god there's like the conversation about sin is so far away we need to talk about salvation first like
there's no point in being into like are you sitting as an atheist like well I don't believe in god so
they're committing theoretically the ultimate sin so like yeah doesn't really matter yeah yeah well
digital Hammurabi Dr. Dr. Bowman he's a Hebrew Bible scholar and he's also a he's the author of
did god did god endorse slavery and so that's the question I'm going to ask you is essentially
like do you think that those verses in the Old Testament where god gave instructions and had
our own beat your sweat and keep your slaves how you can sell them to the nations around you if
they're Hebrew slaves you'd let them go after seven years like do you think those instructions
were from god or was Moses be trippin like which like do you think like literally the god of the
universe said you know I'm gonna meet you where you're at donate shrimp by the way but you know take
the virgin girls for yourself like do you think that that was from god yes right wow so what
okay lots of people what I'll just own it hey well I'm glad you bit the bullet but like what is
like so why why would god command something as horrific as take the virgin girls for yourself
so it's really interesting I if you look at the culture that this was being talked about in
god was so fucking progressive he was always very very progressive for the time so I basically view
god as like kind of this not he's not really a moral relativist but the way that we function
have to engage with god is more relativism more or less and I think like more or less what we have
is this infinite god that is like pulling all of humanity over time closer and closer to what is
goodness and I do think that we are after trending in that direction for the most part and so in a
culture where slavery is everywhere where slavery is common god didn't go don't have slavery because
god is also deeply not political he doesn't tell people how to like run their nations which is
why I'm super opposed to church and the state being blended but he said how do we have
servants and slavery is in the most ethical and like progressive way possible um where you see a
lot of the laws and stuff that he establishes are very protective of the slave that gives them the
most rights but yeah like obviously the ceremony law is dead new testament god is pretty seems to
be pretty opposed to it and you see evidences of this of even for example when jesus um talks to
the Pharisees about divorce he cites deuteronomy I believe although probably your scholar in the chat
can say there's deuteronomy it's an old book because one of those fucking it's a knockbox
you know fucking I'm already I'm already like two and a half drinks it okay I can't be excited on
my post and just so everyone knows this is a friendly conversation and we're drinking we're
just having banter so you know like we're just just chatting so no one take anything too like no one
okay people who hate me will take it seriously and yeah yeah yeah I've already accepted that um
no one's saying anything in my comments I'm just saying that in case like I just don't want people
to like be like that bitch slavery's okay like you know right 118 I've got the clip okay I'm
cleared of all epistemic but I was lucky okay um and so if we look jesus talks to the Pharisees
about divorce because they ask him basically which law is correct because I'm not sure if you're
super rare it sounds like you're very knowledgeable actually about a lot of this stuff
I'm the smonest man alive yeah I can tell um so the keepers would do this like back and forth
all the time where they would take scripture and the Tanakh and then they would argue about it and
they'd have these philosophical writings and a lot of people so this is actually why I'm not
solicitor because the Jews weren't either there was like this original book but then the way that we
engaged even in interpreting the book was based on like to some degree which Hebrew leader you
liked most where you like Levi you know which writing was compelling to you and so you know you
had like the Pharisees and the Sadducees that were always at where the Sadducees were very progressive
you know I always say if I'm anything I'm a Sadducee okay it's not good but who did God
spurn the fucking Pharisees I'm okay right boys I'm just kidding but um you know they're very
progressive in a period of the merchant class whereas the Pharisees were much more conservative
they were much more of the religious class um and we see basically them asking Jesus about
divorce and they're like well which law is correct because there's two oppositional laws
and he says you know he basically I can't I'm not going to quote it perfectly but he basically says
like uh he basically sets up a new law that's even harsher than all the other ones and he says
the reason that we had that before is because your hearts were hard so it's like this element
basically like wait are you saying that God compromised with ancient Hebrew people because
they like couldn't manage anything else and so what I hear is like I don't know if God ever
looked at slavery and was like based right but he said if it's going to exist this is the most
good way that we can do it with like a hope of humanity moving towards being obviously ideally
antis I believe that God is opposed to slavery and so a lot of people look at this as like
God approved of this culture at this time whereas like if I view God as this timeless
immortal ammunition being how much do you view humans he must view us as like not just a single
lifetime but as a generational story of humanity and that he's like pulling along just like we
have two year olds that we kind of like let them slap their siblings it's not okay but it's not the
same as a 15 year old slapping their siblings it feels like I kind of view God's relationship to
humanity like that or he's kind of pulling us in the direction of like hopefully you guys can be
mature eventually you guys can handle tough conversations like being gay and that sort of
thing turns out we're not ready for that conversation apparently um and that's kind of how I view it
not as like a sign off of being like yes slapping it like no no parent looks at the two year old
and goes yes slapping your siblings based right we go like how do we deal with her anger what
are ways to manage it better you know if a slapping of the sibling occurs here's some corrections
but also like here's some redirections a one year old you're not even going to yell at them for
slapping their sibling um you know I've got an 11 year old who viciously attacks my face and I
laugh it off yeah exactly exactly right and so I guess when I view God it's like this timeless
being I'm like how long does he view humanity and I guess maybe it's cool I don't know but that's the
way I view it can I so can I push back a little bit on that because um am I allowed to push back
on that are you okay with that I want to just get permission because it sucks it gets a little
spicy I just don't want you to feel pressure um so Dr. Josh went through in his book he went
through literally it's this thick he went through every single slavery law in the
ancient Near East for every culture and there are some cultures that were far more progressive
than the Hebrews I think in the code of Hammurabi I think it's only three years that you're to
keep a slave at one stage and then huh where were the Hammurabi I'm just not familiar with the group
uh the uh the code of Hammurabi the Hammurabi um the oh my gosh like is it African is it Middle
Eastern is it Hammurabi um was the sixth king of Hammurabi first agency of Babylon I should know
that Babylon so right in the nook where where the where the um where the Israelites were enslaved
so that's that's the first thing but the second thing is why could God say I've got a couple
things let me get them out and then we can talk about them but decide which one you want to talk
about why could God say don't mix fabrics you'd be put to death if you do that but keep slaves
why why why could you say don't eat shrimp but you can keep slaves
thirdly if let's say that let's run down your line of thinking okay and say that God was working
in the time would God work in the time like let's say that let's say prostitution or sex work was
just as common um I guess today as it was um as slavery was back then would God if God wrote a
book now would his commands be you know anal on Thursdays um oral on Tuesdays no sex work on Saturdays
like like would he create rules so that like you can do uh you know you can have an orgy on Sundays
you know use lubricant Wednesdays like what would God use make rules around sex work uh today well
let's let's let's bring it even closer to the original when it says take the virgin girls for
yourself right so that's the these girls are products of war they're the slaves taken for war
for the for for yourself for the purpose of being raped but taking his wives would let's say if if
child sex work was and this stream is going to monetize thanks Dave but let's say child sex work
was um was popular would God create rules around that okay so like blonde girls get to um get thrashed
by a bunch of like men they don't want to be raped by on Wednesdays and then brunettes on Thursdays like
would God work in those systems or does your initial does your response inside you say
fuck no God wouldn't do that that's not God because that's the reaction that I get when I think about
slaves or take the virgin girls or any of these ancient laws if God can say don't he can say don't
own other human beings as property uh just sort of the issues like uh so there was no death penalty
for mixing fabrics just to be clear that's not correct um no it's not a death penalty for mixing
fabrics isn't it to be stoned to don't believe so everything I looked at um death what consequence
oh I might have got that wrong that's okay uh make some fibers
oh yeah yeah so Leviticus 19 you shall keep my statues you shall not let your
cattle breed with different kinds you shall not let your feel you should not sew your
fill with two kinds of seed you should not wear your garments of cloth um cloth made of mixed
material you're not so generally 29 uh so I know I know that he gives a statue I'm just I wasn't
under the protection yeah yeah yeah yeah but regardless anyway so back to back to the point
like do you think that God would would allow these things and say you don't need shrimp
yes sure uh okay for a couple of complicated reasons number one probably in part because
shrimp I think it like was very likely to kill you say with pork they just couldn't cook it
at the proper like degrees is my understanding okay yeah and so saying do not eat something
is what a wearing fabric of two mixed two mixed um yeah that's in Leviticus 19 as we said and I
think that that's a whole list of purity laws in general um the issue is for me what God say this
yes is this like didactically what God cared about not necessarily I think when we're looking at the
Old Testament gets really complicated because I think the relationship that the Hebrews had with God
is very different than a New Testament Christian right there's like all of these laws do I know
that God like cared about all these things necessarily I'm not really sure um I'm just not sure
about this um could he have said just no slaves probably he probably could have um uh he probably
could have had more progressive laws uh but he didn't do I know why no I don't know why I also
don't know the original scripts so I don't have like I can't answer for all this by itself yes
sorry and I don't mean to I don't mean to throw you in a um in a uh in a big you know like I'm not
trying to get you or anything um no no just what I look at so but I'll bite these bullets right
first of all I believe that God gets to decide what's good full stop okay I'm not Catholic in
that way where like Catholics would kind of argue that God is the whole into goodness I would say
God just decides what's good full stop whatever that looks like if God says it's good it's good um
I guess essentially when I look at these things I don't look at this as like
God being like yeah I fucking love slaves I look at like the emergent themes and principles of like
how these laws came about he asked for things like purity from his people he had like these
conversations about like the way that we engage in war and stuff like that I don't really know
what it means to a culture to take virgins I imagine that it has more meaning than the way
that I understand it where it just sounds like they're raping kids um I'll give you the the apologetic
for it is where were these young girls are supposed to go they were that you know I don't give a
shit about that I don't give a shit about that that's not what I'm interested in um it's also
possible though that God just like did yes things that I would look back at and say this is horrific
essentially the way that I reconcile that is two ways number one I again I still look for
emerging patterns of the way that God acted right if he's consistently more progressive
and like asking for greater um kindnesses to people that tells me something I also make a very
big breach between ceremonial law and uh kind of like the new law so this is kind of like the
Marci intake right I don't agree with like the Marci and canonization um but I don't really agree
with any canonization so that's not really that hot of a take um but I think that there's
like a really distinctive cleave and so I haven't fully reconciled but like when people like was
God the same God in Old Testament as New Testament yeah but functionally no like in no way do they
engage similarly at all pretty obviously like there's a very sharp shift in like what God talks
about I don't know fully why it's just like the I don't know answer there I guess personally isn't
enough to like break my faith um yeah oh I'm not trying to sorry I'm not trying to break your faith
I just found it interesting that you don't hold to scripture I don't even know what the word is
scriptures what do you say scripture so solar scripture out solace yeah I don't use that term
ever but it's like you don't you don't think that the bible is like you'd like perfectly give it
yeah so exactly so like these laws and in large part just be like kind of some level of like
historical tradition and I don't really care because it's not like it's not like yeah yes
God wants these things like I'm like I don't know if that's the way that you should be reading all
of these books anyways especially as a Christian under the government because I talked to I talked
to muslims who will say you know aisha was you know in the 60s when Muhammad married him and then
nine when they had sex and they'll say and you know they'll say well no that's not right and
then they'll try and find some apologetics to make it so Aisha was really playing with her dolls
when she was 20 or whatever you know I don't know but um I don't want to do that just to be clear
yeah yeah I'm going to buy something as possible that God just said yes to slavery and I don't
know why yeah yeah I don't know why this just and just for your audience and maybe this is
something that you'd love to do I have a lot of scholars on the channel sometimes talk about way
more complicated things than I understand but one of the things that I did because I started
coming up a lot was I ran a panel with five bible scholars on does the bible condone slavery
and we it's literally like the I'm really proud of this thing um when it loads it'll it'll show
but we have Dr. Josh Bowen who's a Hebrew bible scholar speaks languages reads literally gives
his own translations of the bible as seriologists Dr. Kip Davis who's the same um Hebrew bible
scholar expert on the Dead Sea Scrolls uh Dr. Matt Munger who's a professor of this in uh in a university
you know also he's a linguist so he understands like all the languages like Cady in Aramaic
Hebrew I know I know I've read some of the guys some of these guys's work so yeah yeah I mean
like they're like they're all my besties all of them you know Dr. John of a bird New Testament scholar
Dr. Dan McClellan everyone knows Dr. Dan McClellan I didn't talk about him but he is like the
head scriptures translator supervisor for the church of uh Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
amazing panel I don't mean to toot my own horn um but it's um it was well it was all those guys but
that'd be a real fun one to go over and let me just quickly while I'm here shout out 100
epithet of deep drinks coming up it's going to be awesome secret guests coming on yeah
there's going to be some surprises make sure you come and check that out and let me just quickly shout
out um uh your twitter so amazing image of you and your best friend there Andrew Tate um I love
I love that image so much but go check out uh not so it's twitter here it's uh it's it's all good
stuff I'm not going to scroll too far in case you posted something not safe for work and of
course I linked in the description but I don't have it up here anymore for some stupid reason
but your youtube channel um not so erudite is linked in the description and where you're currently
streaming um right now uh so everyone go go subscribe to not so erudite um you produce really
awesome content uh I want to pivot if I can um into something something a little bit more fun
a little less doom and gloom and hopefully hopefully um you enjoy it so um if I could get
one last little thought out yeah yeah get one get one more thing yeah yeah basically what I'd say
is it is possible that god yes then all these things and I don't have an answer for it and I
think the worst thing I could do is give like super cringe empty apologies like well it wasn't
really that bad maybe it was I just haven't like looked into it yeah yeah do you know what every
like every person that comes after you for the like every christian that comes after you for
these the takes that you've given today make little videos like that Andrew dude who probably will
his his worldview is um like so like just know that you're being I think you are being so much
more intellectually honest than a lot of the people who are going to come after you but um
one of the one of the things I do uh on this channel is I drink a lot of whiskey with um
Bible scholars and one of the Bible scholars I had on was Dr. Kip Davis and he
studies the Hebrew Bible yeah yeah yeah and uh he um he studies the um the Dead Sea Scrolls
don't know him personally obviously oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he's great he's great you should have him
on your channel like he's he's great if you get him on but he's I interviewed him and he dropped
something on me that was so fucking wild and I know that you love diving into the scripture and I
hope you haven't seen this before but I'm just gonna show a little clip of a of a of a video I
made called Lost Christianity which shows part of the interview but I'll just uh let me know if you
can hear it uh that's right now so one of the most famous things that that is attributed to Jesus
is the Sermon on the Mount the Beatitudes they're in the Dead Sea Scrolls really the Dead Sea Scrolls
now keep in mind I was really drunk there but did you hear what he said yeah the Beatitudes
were in the Dead Sea Scrolls so skip ahead so this is the manuscript is called 4Q which means it
came from K-4 4Q Beatitudes so there is the um now it's not a carbon copy he goes on to say that
but you've got eight blessed statements and a ninth longer blessed statement you know so there's the
Qumran written 50 years before Jesus was even born and then you've got Jesus's um Jesus's version
as recorded in the Gospels and it's a little bit similar right which is really cool uh and what
what Kip goes on to say is he says that he kind of shows that and not a lot of people read the
Dead Sea Scrolls but it shows that Jesus was a product of his time and place like he was in it
now this is this is wild you talk a lot about Pharisees you talk a lot about Sadducees
and I'm sure you know a little bit about the Essenes as well yeah so one of one of the things
okay okay most people might know Pharisees and Sadducees although that's probably
and there's there's the Pharisee there's the Christian Christian perspective of
Pharisees and Sadducees which is like the like the angry guys coming into like ruin Jesus's good
time but there's actually so much more interesting than that yeah it's kind of simply though the
religious class and the mercantile class and then yeah yeah go ahead so these these scenes I don't
know too much about these scenes but some people are arguing that the people in the Dead Sea Scrolls
might have been Essenes and and Jesus may have come from a community of people uh look I'm
butchering this you're gonna have to go watch the interviews with Kip and James Taber but let me
just read some stuff and stop from you now now this blew me away okay this like blew me away I
just want to get your your take I hope you haven't heard it before okay so the Essenes um so let me
just let me just drop this actually let me just drop this quickly um so I did an interview I got a
15 minute interview with um uh with uh James Taber Dr. James Taber Dr. James Taber and he is a Dead Sea
Scrolls uh like professor and he talks about I had 15 minutes with him and he has a course on
MVP courses linked in the description of course and um he talks about like what's in the Dead Sea
Scrolls and one of the things he brought up which ties into what Kip said is this and this this blows
my mind right this is what the Essenes were doing right now tell me tell me if this sounds familiar
to you okay or I'm not sure if this was the Essenes sorry but this is what the Dead Sea Scrolls community
were doing okay I don't know if there were scenes there's argument about that but they the Dead Sea
Scrolls community were an apocalyptic messianic group so they're waiting for the Messiah they're
preparing the way in the wilderness as their main mission okay they're preparing the way in the
wilderness they talk about a new covenant so this is before Jesus remember this is before Jesus
they're referred to as the children of light they practice immersion in water not just for
ritual purity but also in it um as an initiation to be born again into their group uh they have a
prophet or teacher akin to the new Moses they emphasize the Holy Spirit they have a council
of 12 and an inner council of three they sell the possessions and live communally they can sit this
is this is wild ready they consider the Jerusalem temple to be a den of thieves and the priests are
brood of vipers they believe that their prayers are their sacrifice and they believe um um they
believe that they as a people are the true temple of God so the people of the temple of God not the
actual temple in um second temple in Jerusalem um what do you think about that who does that sound
like sounds like christ yeah that sounds like everything Jesus talked about isn't that amazing
a little combo of two yeah yeah it's amazing and like like this is this is the stuff that i i just
knew you would like find interesting and i'm sure like you've got like a billion tabs open now i'm
ready to like deep deep deep dive into this stuff but um yeah it's super similar actually if you look
into uh buddhist teachings before Taoism grab buddhism and like shook it around and like made
it kind of shitty original buddhism is so aligned with scripture it's crazy it's actually oh it's
crazy like the principles the like concepts that it teaches is so similar to what christ teaches
it's i mean i i hold that i have a very like weird viewer i'm like i believe like god tries to show
himself a lot um Jesus is one of the means i think Aristotle was one of the means where you
like tried to direct people towards like goodness uh and i think buddha is also one of them if i'm
being you know since we're being super heretical here i mean as well yeah let's let's let the
heros please up yeah exactly so um that's kind of how i see good if you look at the uh yeah there's
a lot of people that really love original buddha teachings and they're they're really beautiful
honestly i would highly recommend like reading some of the original stories and stuff they're
really cool before again before Taoism kind of got in there and it's like how do we control
people so yeah i i try to read the Pali canon i did read it i listened to the audio version
of something and it was pretty hard for me to understand and everything but i really like
the story of Kisabutami in the Dhammapada i don't know if that's new buddhism or old buddhism but
do you know the story at all but maybe if you described it to me i would very similar
very similar to jesus in that um so it has mustard seeds but similar in that a woman her
child was just died and she runs to everyone help okay can you help my child just died on
the story yes okay yeah and someone says go see the buddha the goes and sees the buddha the buddha
says yes i can help you and your child but you need to bring me some mustard seeds but it must
come from a house where no one's died and she goes from house to house and each person says yes i can
get you mustard seeds oh wait you don't know someone has died here and eventually she realizes that
no one escapes death so she brings her child to the burial ground buries him and then goes back
to the buddha and the buddha says um why uh where you know where's your child like how are we gonna
end and um she says forget about my child let me be a disciple uh because she was taught the lesson
that death is inevitable i that that really helped me that was like a really beautiful moment when i
was a beautiful story because it's also this story about like nose like i sent you like sometimes
things just don't work out sometimes like your hollywood story isn't there you know um which i
think is like really really important for obviously people of faith but also just anyone to understand
that like sometimes things just are tragic um and that's part of a lot of life and like how do you
reconcile that with your faith with yourself um with your community so yeah um yeah um for sure
well we're we're coming up to time can you go a little bit over is that is already are you
was nine nine minutes ago do you mind if i grab i knocked my cup over so do you mind if i do yeah
okay it's i got a waterproof thing i just want to like wrap it up yeah yeah yeah no no problem
uh and let me while we while um kala does that let me look for
what i'm talking i get so
all right found it so this is kyla's channel not so erudite really cool stuff i um i watched a lot
of it sneak and expose a lot of like pop culture kind of like like internet culture kind of stuff
but yeah really some really really base takes especially around psychology um and things like
that so guys make sure you check out um kala's channel it's it's good was jesus a jerk i love i
think you had a quote somewhere where you said um jesus was kind but spicy is that was that a quote
or did i just write that down in reference to what you're saying kind like me i do like to use the
word spicy what sounds like me i'll take it i'll take that's so good he's super spicy he's super
spicy he's crazy yeah like telling people like drink his blood and that was one of things we
learned in ministry college that was like a way to offend the people so it would like scatter
or even when you call themselves like the sun it's like a it's a bit of like a knock against
the emperor like the roman emperor uh oh really the son of god yeah and back in the day the emperor
was always called the son of god and so it's like a little it's a little edgy to be like yeah i'm the
son of god it's like wait what wait what bro are you sure yeah that was crazy uh i will say this
your type of faith seems so much more freeing than most i'm almost any christian i talked to
which is um which uh yeah and you said that's a huge thing for you like it's you feel so fulfilled
in your faith which is great yeah i mean i i always have like this insecurity and this fear that the
fundamentalists are right um and that i'm just like the stupid libtard is like trying to make
faith work for my sensibilities um but i've kind of gotten to this place of being like it gives me
so much fulfillment and i genuinely believe in god and i think he loves me and i'm genuinely doing
my damnedest to like move towards where they think is true and not lie to myself and like if god
isn't okay with that then like he's just never been the god that i believe that he was um and you
know if i get to heaven and he's like hey uh you're a fucking moron i'll be like yep yep sorry
sorry boss um but yeah and if i don't get to heaven and there's nothing then you know
fuck it pascal's waiter doesn't really matter because it gives me a lot of joy at this point
yeah exactly how much um how much longer can you go for like a you like 15 minutes i don't have any limits
okay so we can we go for like another half an hour even an hour possibly if you want to
okay look because i'm really enjoying this conversation like i put my hair extensions in
okay i'm looking great okay and at this point i'm like decently drunk so great this is exactly
where this is where now if i get to find out i don't think everyone's ever seen me drunk on
stream and a lot of people were worried that i'd be like an angry drunk but i'm mostly just like a
super happy trying to make sure everyone else has a good time drunk that's awesome yeah that's
that's really good um yeah okay well where where do we go from here like because there's there's um
i was kind of look what i'm gonna do all right because because we're in a happy state i'm
can i give you some um some quotes some edgy i guess uh philosophy memes i'm gonna call it um
but they're kind of taken from books that kind of require like a deeper level of thought somewhere
from atheist books some i think they're all from atheist books actually no one's a christian but
it's it's kind of make to make an i'd read some quotes i've got four quotes for you and i want
to get your take on them okay does that sound good okay the first the first one is from christopher
hitchens uh for even god is not great they're not all new atheists by the way but this is one
violent irrational intolerant allied to racism tribalism and bigotry invested in ignorance
and hostility to free inquiry contemptuous of women and coercive towards children organized
religion or to have it's a great deal on its conscience conscience thoughts
i uh i guess i talk about communism and religion uh yeah i think uh that's interesting so i i
i attribute religious think as a psychological propensity that i think spiritual people are
the most inclined we assume spirituality with religious think but i view lots of major ideology
as kind of religious in the way that they engage and make the more fundamental religious you are
about your group the more we see bigotry and hatred and like these kind of these outgroups
suffer as a result of it and so it's not surprising to me that religion has done it but
it's hard to look at the last hundred years and think i don't i can't i can't take away from
the last hundred years of being like it's just religion that can lead people like hatred and
violence it's like oh it turns out it's any idea that we get very in grouped about and deeply deeply
partisan um to kind of what i would call a religious degree i think like the things that
were done in fascism the things were done in communism um even if you look at like the rwandan
genocide right the huti and the tutsi uh tutsis yeah um i don't know it feels like ideology
that's extreme and group think you can lead to really scary outcomes um and i don't think religion
is the only method of that but it is absolutely a medium by which that's been no question
which is yeah interesting yeah there's um have you ever have you ever seen the um christopher
hitchens and steven fryer debate two members of the catholic church yeah yeah that's probably the
only time and don't use the word because it'll i know you know how to stream but the um he uses
the f slur like for homosexuals uh and he uses that uh christvichens uses that in a way that
i'm still very uncomfortable about but it like it's probably it's it's close or ever get to for me
finding an acceptable use of that word where it's like what he does is he says he essentially uses
it to demonstrate like the the how disgusting like the the idea of not letting lgbt folks into the
church was so he says it's i'm just for your audience who hasn't seen it but he's saying like
and and deep links audience they're saying he's he's saying to the catholic church like oh my gosh
he's saying you won't let my friend steven fry into the church you say that he's he's perfect
he's made in the image of god oh no you're not you're an f slur and you can't join our church
and you can't um go to heaven and the way that he said that was so harsh like he says literally
word it's uh pretty brutal but he does it in a way to show the seriousness of the crime
the moral crime i think for the catholic church and i i i really appreciate that what are your
thoughts on that with someone who has a a tactical slur yeah who has a gay brother who like you know
you've seen firsthand what is what the church uh did to him is your question about the slur use or
about the weight of the church yeah like i guess both yeah um i think words are words um i think a
tactical slur is just as good as a tactical swear i don't know um yeah i think the words of power
that we give them fundamentally and i understand why people give words certain power i just i just
have a hard time caring about words that if i'm being honest um because i think it's the ideas
behind it that matter um bosh is right tactical slurs are base um not that i've ever used them to
be honest um no but yeah it is it is interesting just because it really like you really need to
really need to bring home the there was a the the seriousness of crime i won't i won't say it but um
i didn't interview with the um with the next muslim and they asked me you know and i i described in
detail i guess um muhammad's first night with isha and just describing it in detail like saying like
you know when muhammad pulled out his erect penis and you know like and i just described in detail
describe what would happen not in like a flamboyant or like over the top way it made it like oh
shit like it's like all of a sudden you realize it's definitely bad it's not something that you can
just like we like you know well you know she was of the age of maturity and you know you can't it's
like you gotta get it's like this is serious yeah it's it's punchy i just think in our current
social media culture there's like this desire to use really punchy words um when they're not really
warranted so i think that it loses effect like i think the word like genocide for example it's
kind of been like stretched uh the word grape which for whatever reason you won't allow me to say the
actual word which is really cringe um gets like stretched right i i understand the utilization
of it from a agitative standpoint um it can sometimes i think take away from the actual
idea wrestling because it morally loads what you're talking about um but yeah i understand
kind of like what you're saying as far as like how the church engages with the lgbtq community
i think it's pretty pathetic um but the church definitely just like picks and chooses
its sins and it's like super chill with gluttony um but it has like a really big issue with like
gay people and that's not like obvious to me i'm still trying to figure out the principle behind
sexual sins um because the way that sexual sins looked when like paul was writing for example
is not like they were dealing with a lot of like paganistic like like church boys that
were getting like fucked from behind and it was like super abusive like it's really hard to compare
that to a modern era of like a gay couple so i'm trying to figure out like what's the principle
behind sexual sins is it and i the reason i use gluttony is like i feel like it might be something
similar like this this kind of audaciousness to just be like to stuff yourself into this like
have have have have have and kind of like um in the case of sexual sin to the expense of others
feels like connected to the sexual sin um but i just feel like i don't i just hate fundamentalism
i think it's inherently heretical and i think it's led to a lot of bad geology and i think
even though i'm a protestant because i'm protesting the catholic church i think
protestants have like some of the worst theology on the planet um it's pretty embarrassing and i
don't like talk into the above yeah do you so like do you don't like the hill song
Bethel type you know ask like what's worse for you the process the kev Copeland's the
you know prosperity preachers for sure i think the hills yeah the hill song people are just like
like hill song especially i don't know if you've ever met people from hill song as of australia i've
not only never met them like bobby and brian houston the the critics of it used to be like friends with
the they said they had bobby had a fiftieth in my friend's house like yeah yeah i know i'm no
connected with hill song when i grew up actually oh wow okay yeah weirdly uh yeah super i don't
know if you know like matt corby do you know who matt corby is i know the name it's been a while
but i know the singer songwriter who was burned by hill song but he was a really burgeoning
singer songwriter in hill song church before he got burnt by the church and now he's agnostic
and he's brilliant musicians you definitely check them out but um he had like this weird
relationship with the wife of one of my church's pastors and so we had like this weird tight
connection with hill song um there's like a lot of bad theology in it but like a lot of a lot of
the hill song members are like they're kind of like the type of christians where i'm like
they're the type of protestants where i'm like yeah you should just be that where they're like
i just like want to love people and be nice i don't know how i feel about gays but i don't
really want to judge people and like i just want people to experience god's love i'm like that's
not super theological sound but you know it's probably it's probably literally closer to what
god wants than like the eastern the new growth of like online eastern orthodox that's like
i only believe in god so i can justify hating women and gay people yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah uh it's funny one of the one of a friend of a friend used to be on the band or he was
training to be in the band for the the youth group at hill song united in sydney i think it was
and all the band members would go out afterwards and do like they'll be at parties doing like
coke and pingas and stuff and i brought this to a journalist and i was like i was like uh
who wrote the book beyond belief how pentecostal christianity is taking over the world
and they just tweeted back i've had it on the show uh l and i she tweeted back well it is sydney
and i was just like okay i guess everyone just does coke in sydney like anyway okay that's what
we do it's like uh you know it's like having a kiwi in the morning you know coke at night and kiwi
in the morning he's healthy okay so this is one that you might or might not agree with i'm not sure
uh marcus ralias live a good life if there are gods and they adjust then they will not care how
devout you have been but you will be welcomed um they'll welcome you based on the virtues you've
lived by if there are gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them if there are no
gods then you should then you will be gone but you will have lived a noble life that you that will
live on in the memories of your loved ones sorry for my reading okay uh you know one of the original
stoics i'm a little biased okay i love you og stoics i like appetitors more but i really
this is pretty good um there are gods there just then they will not care about how devout you have
been but will welcome you based on the virtues you've lived by there are gods but unjust um yeah
sure it's like fair enough um i don't know i try to be very cautious and humble as a human
like if i truly believe that god is infinite an omniscient and omnipresent i try to be so this
is where i think liberal christians are a little bit cringe but they're like that's just nice and i'm
like anybody who's dealt with addiction can tell you that just being nice and enabling is one of the
fastest pathways to hell like it's not good it just makes you feel good and that's not love and so
probably in part because of my addiction work i understand that like god is if i believe that
god is love but that means that there's going to be harsh lines and there's also going to be in
like high levels of grace the issue is that i don't know where those two lines get drawn
and i really want to be cautious in speaking for an infinite essentially so i speak a lot
about my personal experience with it um i don't believe god is just simple as being like uh free
love like you know he's like holding up like a free hug sign and stuff um he's probably a little
bit harsher than that because i think real love is um real love doesn't enable real love does say
at times like this isn't okay um the problem is that now we're getting into divination and we're
getting into like the ultimate ultimate like before the throne of god i i don't know i don't
know where i don't know where grace ends and like harshness and punishment begins i have no idea um
but i i guess that fundamentally i believe that god is good which means like whatever
line he draws there if i can like understand it i'd probably be like yeah fair enough you know
like i'm like probably hitler's like you know hopefully he's past the line i would hope that
would be base um you know richard ramirez fuck that guy he's a fucking piece of shit uh i hope
he's past the line for i don't know who's richard ramirez he's like a serial killer who was like
really anti-women and he's just like super gross and killed a lot oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he's a
shit um but i don't know when it comes to like who ends up where and stuff i don't know i just
again i think god is good um and so i guess to some degree i trust that and if other people
don't i get it that's between you and him uh not between me and you so okay um i've got a bit of a
bit of a a so you love nature right you're a huge nature fangirl or you know sure i've heard
you talk about him a couple of times i haven't read any nature i've read intercrossed i think
he's very portable he's a good one to flex in debates yeah yeah yeah yeah uh it's weird that
i'm an atheist and i haven't read because it because all atheists seem to like love nature right
is that a is that a thing or is it not or is that is that like it is but it's kind of a
bash civilization like they're like yeah god is dead and yeah yeah it was sad about that just to
be clear like he nature thought it was a bad thing that religion was dying just yeah he's kind of
like the Jordan Peterson of the time was he uh that's that's very insulting yeah no 2018 Jordan
Peterson and nature are very similar we have to criticism there's not a lot of constructions
so he has a quote that he has sorry not not nature but the way i ask that is because my
fanboy i'm a fanboy of david hume i love david hume do you know any much about david hume
a little bit okay uh so he had this like his his book uh on miracles was is fantastic
and he has this quote um no testimony and this is and this will go this this could be a long
conversation in in and of itself but no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle unless that
testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood will be more miraculous than the fact which
endeavors to establish and then let me just post that so you can read it because it's i know it's
hard to and then he goes on to say a wise man proportions i'll say a wise person proportions
his belief to the evidence what do you think because that first one there is probably the most
contentious but i think the first one is this one on screen no yeah the long screen to establish
a miracle i'm okay prototype about me this is my husband's vein i'm terrible listening to people
read things to me i need to read it with i literally i just zone out and i do other things
that's what that's what my wife's testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle unless a testimony
be of such kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which endeavors which it
endeavors to establish interesting so so for example like let's say i think he gives an example
like let's say you see someone have their head cut off and the next day you see them walking
down the street and they say my head came back on uh what is more likely that one you're mistaken
or or two they were lying or or that they had actually did come back on um it's it's about
hands did you wash their head get cut off yeah if you watch their head get cut off and the only
likely answer is that they're like some sort of weird miracle happened or it was a body double
yeah yeah it could be um another quote uh let me just this is going to be here can you know what
i'll bring this up on screen so we can read it together okay um because i know maybe you can
read it out like because you're a better reader than i am when anyone tells me that he saw a dead
man restored to life i immediately consider it within uh with myself whether it be more probable
that this person should either deceive or be deceived or that the fact which he relates
should really have happened i weigh the one miracle against the other and according to the
superiority which i discover i pronounce my decision and always reject the greater miracle
if the falsity of his testimony would be more miraculous in the event which he relates
then and not till then can he pretend to command my belief or opinion
what are your thoughts on that and i'll leave it up for a little bit um i think a lot of christians
are obsessed with miracles um i think god works through systems more than he works through miracles
to be honest um so for me even even back to like say when people saw jesus after he was crucified
like is it more likely david shum here is saying is it more likely that um
um that people are mistaken or they're lying or that literally someone has risen from the dead
um and i think david huma is missing the point i guess okay well i don't think he's talking
specifically about jesus but it's like yeah yeah no i think i think the principal misses the point
um okay what's the point when it comes to like the story of christ whether he like was raised or not
have you ever heard the story about how porcupines shoot their quills
no okay all right tell me so jordan peterson talks about this i didn't realize it wasn't
like a mad global thing apparently it's he's from alberta he actually was raised like four
hours north of me um which is super weird at least you're a lot of like cultural similarities so
i grew up being taught by like my teachers and all the adults that porcupines could shoot their quills
because they have a shitload of porcupines in alberta and they're really fucking dangerous um
and they're fast they're i don't know if you've ever seen a porcupine run but they're fast
yeah they're spooky just like a ball of of rage and pointiness are they like a kidneys like we
have a kidneys in australia but are they like kidneys i have no idea what that is there so
they're like i'm asking you all these questions you just don't have the answer to okay they're like
a beaver covered in quills and dogs will like find them and get like covered in quills like
they're they're actually pretty nasty you don't want to be anywhere near a porcupine and their
quills are barbed in a way that they like hook into you and they can't be removed easily so you
have to like push them through cut the tip off and then pull them out they're like a they're like
a barbed arrow basically um so i grew up learning that porcupines could shoot their quills which is
not true by the way they cannot shoot their quills that's crazy but i learned it and most
alberta kids do and so there's this element of like it goes back to William James what's
functionally true can porcupine shoot their quills no but it is functionally valuable
for everyone to believe that porcupines can shoot their quills especially like when you're young
um and so when it comes to like these questions of like miracles and stuff like that with god
there's this element of are you missing like the heart of the question here which is like
did jesus get like raised from the dead and all these sort of things like did it factually
occur where his genomes just won because he only had mary as like his you know his DNA investor
it's kind of like dissecting a bird to find a song um it's not the point it's not what we're
trying to do here and it's not most importantly it doesn't seem to me that that's what the
Hebrew people were trying to do they weren't trying to like outline this didactic histology
histological factual story they're trying to outline a song because the song is like the most
important part of this conversation and if you're so busy dissecting the bird to find the song all
you do is kill the song and the bird you you're missing it even though you might be like oh it's
the vocal cords and larynx blah blah blah it's like it that doesn't matter what matters is like
what that song means what it meant to in that moment that has occurred and it feels like when
we get into like rationalism that's where we it feels like we've missed like 50 percent of the
conversation um it's like our left hemisphere takes over and we just abandon the right hemisphere
which is like there isn't language there isn't words but if i describe an experience of standing
in front of a sunset and just for a moment feeling nothing but infinite peace i can't really put a
i can't put a bunch of phrases to it it's just if you can close your eyes and picture it you know
exactly what i'm talking about and yeah i that's okay i love on a dog barks and strings but um
i i agree with that actually uh very strongly but like when i'm standing on a cliffside looking at
the beach watching a sunset i i don't attach truth to that i don't attach like a truth claim to that i
just experience it does it make sense but there is a truth claim there right like if you so think
about like your favorite moments in your life so i have a couple that i think of one of them is i
was riding along on my horse on a trail ride with five of the kids that i had been working with since
they were 13 so it's like five years into working with them we were just riding through the forest
and everyone was silent everyone was silent it was just riding their horse they'd been with their
horse for like a month and like the deep truth of that was i love these kids so much at this
moment is pressed into my brain and it will never not be good and i will never not love them
in that that's like the wallflower like in that moment we were infinite and i know that this is
like a dissatisfying unscientific answer i think it's like the greatest bane that a scientist
like fall into is like forgetting forgetting those moments where we're infinite it's like what is the
capital t truth i can't put it into words but if i talk to my kids about it they know exactly
they know exactly what i'm talking about all of my kids when i talk to them when they're like
going through recovery when they were going through like major traumas in their life they would
remember moments like when we another moment that's infinite for me is when we slept out on the hills
and in the morning the horses got loose from their pasture so it was like 4 a.m and we wake up to the
sounds of like hoof beats and we like sit up on this hillside there's like the sunrise occurring
and then all of our horses are just running at us like at like mock 10 what their hair on fire is
terrifying and as a counselor i was like oh my god my kids are going to get trampled and then like
last minute they diverge away from our beds and so there's just like these horses straining past us
as we're looking at the sentencing what's the truth in that moment i don't know but it's everything
you see i i have a different kind of different perspective on that and i'm not saying either
is right or wrong i view those experiences as like that like i can you can make objective statements
about those experiences we were intense or we were under the stars we stood up the horses coming
towards us you know those are objective statements and even then you can go back further and say
we we we thought we saw these things that's what seemed to be what was happening maybe you were in
some simulation or something who knows right we go back it's like as far as you possibly want with
philosophy but um you make objective points about that but then you also have that emotional
experience and that emotional experience is a fact you experience something but i don't know whether
or not like you can then make prescriptions from that so for example like going back to my barley
poolside you know hindu book i had an experience but i don't necessarily think that that i can then
claim anything from that or i had experiences in church i don't like okay i'll give you something
if i had the most powerful experience that i've ever had you know church and and and there was
the same things that i used to call god i hope that i'm this is what i've said to myself and this is
a what we put on my eighties for sore again but i hope i'm intellectually honest enough
for that not to shift my worldview that's that's where i'm at because i doesn't matter the experience
i i know that my experiences can be deceptive i know that i can um
like i can love my wife and then i can find i could find out something that i still like i
could find out that she's a serial killer or something she's the um richard guy or the guy
that you mentioned before hates men goes around killing men or something uh you know and i would
still probably love her but i wouldn't i'd probably turn her in i wouldn't want to be around her you
don't mean like so you'd have these conflicting things but so i i don't know i just don't hold
any weight to emotional truth and i think part of that is my anxiety and and maybe you could speak
to this but for a long time my mantra was feelings aren't facts feelings aren't facts because i
constantly felt like the world was falling down around me i felt like me and amy's relationship
was falling apart even though it was perfect i felt like god was telling me to break out with
amy even i couldn't find any good reason i felt like i talked about this in a previous stream
i had ocd and part of the ocd i had was god wants me to break out with amy which is part of purity
culture i had um ocd thoughts that i was going to spontaneously quote unquote become gay and then
i won't be attracted to women anymore and then that'll make me and amy's relationship fall apart
even though i was even i'm straight like and i'm like it was wild so i'd have these intrusive thoughts
i had to work with a therapist with and my big thing was feelings aren't facts i may feel like
everything's falling apart but it's not i may feel like you know i've got some sort of terminal
illness but i don't like i and and so i always have to try and push towards facts and a lot of
people including my psychologist say i'm very open intellectually but i'm very closed off
emotionally like i've like i put a wall around i don't like change in my emotion i don't like it
to sway me and that's probably there might be a fault of mine but but yeah what what do you think
about that like yeah feelings aren't facts but feelings are flags um and i think that's really
important and so it's really important to figure out your feeling system and when it gives you
false flags right when you have a mental illness for example i have anxiety um my feeling all the
time right um i'm sure you're very used to misattribution of arousal you're feeling really
agitated and weird it's a classic anxiety thing and so like it's probably because my partner did
something that upset me and so you like start a fight with your partner and it's like no i was
just like anxious this one right ssri changed my life because i was like oh wait i can like be in
my body and like not feel distressed all the time feelings are flags and then there's these moments
like when you feel infinite and i i think that there's it's a feeling but it's also like the
spiritual moment and the truth that comes from that is usually the most simple truths it's things
for like i don't think anyone would argue with for example like i want to give my kids one moment
of this where they feel connected to each other connected to an animal and deeply loved in that
piece no one's gonna who's gonna who the fuck's gonna fight with me like nah your kid should
not feel at peace or love like nobody's gonna say that and so like the deep truth is like
this is what this is what i want to pursue is like little tiny moments where i'm able to
create this for somebody and experience that is it a feeling yeah kind of but it's like more than
that um and so i don't know maybe it's the dbt in me but i think feelings matter what's dbt and you
knock your max are electrical behavioral therapy oh your mark is i can have dialectical behavioral
therapy it's by mr linahan yeah um and so it's very big do you know what a dialectic is no it's
when you take two opposite ideas and you find a new truth within them so have you ever you've
probably heard the serenity prayer um yeah you know i want to change the things that i can and
accept the things that i can't that's a dialectic um and i find a lot of truths come from this
combination of oppositional this is why i as a liberal i love talking to conservatives because
i feel like i find new emergent truths within this which is like love is giving to others but
also having minds like love is both compassion and boundaries that's a dialectic they feel
opposite to each other but they're necessary together for a greater truth and so um dbt would
say something like wisdom is your emotional mind and your logic mind kind of finding like
harmony between each other where you listen to the flags of your feelings
and you counter it with the thoughts of your logic brain and you find something between
there that emerges and you go that's true and it gives you peace a lot of time when you when you
realize it so um well yeah i understand discounting feelings um because i think we treat them like
capital t truths um and i don't want to do that but i don't want to fully disregard feelings
because there's a lot of things there's a really good ted talk by a woman who had a stroke
that shut down her entire left hemisphere and she's a neuroscientist
super cool and she talks about her experience when only her right hemisphere was online and
we're a very uh right hemispheric neglectful society in many ways we're very out of touch with
this connectiveness kind of like you know like the avatars are like fucking like stick their
hair braid things yeah it's kind of yeah it's kind of sexual okay remove the sexuality that's
kind of like what the right hemisphere is always trying to do like the right hemisphere doesn't
really see the difference between like me and you we're just like we um and i feel like our society
misses that which is why so often we try to dissect a bird to try to find a song um which
i don't think is what we should do it's it's so you see i could i could even see myself being someone
who um well i couldn't i don't think i could see myself but i i well i could see it i could see
how i could process being someone who prays sings praise and worship does all those kind of things
but but having no but admitting to myself that i i don't i don't actually believe those things is
that weird is that like a weird thing because it's like i feel like if you you've had those
experience with the cut someone's they've had to cut someone's the connection between the two
hemispheres and they someone points to you know do believe in god and they point to yes and they
say no or they say yes and they say yeah it's like just half the brain go to hell and half the
brain going to have like yeah what the language in heaven okay it'll just be it'll be awesome yeah um
so i i'm totally lost my channel thought this is the alcoves effect of me um very much so but um
yeah i'm lost my channel thought sorry you're talking about uh left hemisphere right hemisphere
going to hell and heaven um god damn i got oh yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry i can see that like i could
have apologies everyone the alcoves effect of me but the um but i can see how someone could hold
like have these experiences and find i guess quote unquote truth in them i just i just like it goes
back to fundamentally that i think that you know it also kind of build an objective worldview i can't
like like if someone's someone showed me some artwork and they're like do you like this artwork
i'm like yeah it's amazing or like what you know when me and my wife are having sexy time i'm not
like okay three thrusts in is the optimal like like i'm not going to like you know there are
moments when i use the art the music that the taste the texture when i'm cooking i hate baking
there's all measuring and shit like fuck that when i'm cooking but when i'm cooking i can like
add a bit of this add a bit of that like you know taste it like you know i can it's a it's a different
part of my brain part of my human experience um so i could definitely see how like someone
in that case could like i guess be religious but not be religious so they're like oh i know
it's all just make believe in fact i i interviewed um bitty buddha who when she deconstructed her
faith she became really nihilistic and she hated it she like she became really depressed
because she was just nihilistic so she found this thing called ritual agnosticism so she still
does like crystals tarot cards buddhas meditations like all that kind of stuff like you see her
dreadlocks down to a you know bomb like she's she and she's really into like that kind of
i guess scene um you know and um but she doesn't attach any truth claim to them she does them as
like a fun like she does tarot cards it's like a fun way to engage with like a side that she misses
now she's not in religion but she doesn't like if you were to sit her down and be like
do you believe that there is something behind this she'd go no like well maybe some like emotional
state or some like thing but not but not like ghosts or like god or something sure and i guess i would
say the emotional state is what's behind it like why are we dismissing that i don't know it seems it
seems odd to me just to dismiss that thing it's like do you read fiction like some of the most
important stories in my life are fiction yeah they're not true but they're true yeah they're true
have you ever read uh or my archives it's the greatest uh it's amazing um there's this character
oh no i'm too drunk to remember his name old guy oh brandon sanderson fan and sanderson it is and
there's this character he's this old guy um hold on i need to know his name
i love that we're just like we're just we're just like i'm just okay with like just us googling
stuff now in the interview this is the perfect level of drama it's dalinar i always google stuff
why would i wrestle with ideas if i can't google things like yeah exactly why would i wrestle
with you if i just had the incorrect remembrance of it um his name is dalinar and um his story
is so uh it was so healing for me to read this it's an amazing story it's not true dalinar
didn't exist there aren't like magical sprites that give you superpowers but none of that's real
but dalinar's story is true which is like the story of a man who did evil he did great evil
and he hated himself for it and he to escape the like wrongs that he's done he just he made
a trade with essentially like a witch um who helped him forget it but the cost of him forgetting
his evils was he also forgot his wife um and when he starts like making this relationship with this
spiritual sprite person he suddenly has to remember everything and so part of like what
happens in the stormlight archives is you have to make a bunch of packs and so one of the one
of the quotes is like what's the most important step that's like the question he's been trying to
answer this whole time and the answer is the next one um and for me when i read that um somebody
i deal with a lot of self-loathing um not for good reason like dalinar genocide in an entire city
i've never done anything like that um i'm actually not i haven't done like anything crazy i don't
have a good reason for self-loathing i was just bullied a lot i think um but it's this it's this
story of no matter what you've done there's a journey ahead of you that you can make up for it
there's a journey ahead of you that keep meaningful and dalinar becomes the greatest
character ever he's the most honorable he's the most true to his like packs and when i think of
things like religion and emotion it feels like this is what i mean it feels like north america
in like desire for empiricism which like i love him here i love science um we've forgotten about
fiction and stories and how important they are and how true they are even though they're not true
like there needs to be a new word hey like i know what you mean like they're true but not true
yeah yeah exactly they're they're a fable it's not real right so when people like oh like jesus
is just a fable i'm like and if he is just a fable he's deeply true he's the most true thing ever
even though he's maybe he's just a fable that's fine with me because he's deeply true like what
he's teaching us what he's talking to us about the like dynamic nature that we have with like us
in the world and like maybe the eternal is so deeply meaningful that something like whether
or not it's like factual or not is it feels to me like missing the point it's like it would be like
somebody being like how can stern light archives be meaningful to you it's not even a real story
and i'm like yeah yeah yeah i i want to murder people who do that like uh two two books that
have really impacted me was stoner um i forgot uh the author i've only read it once but the one
that really gets me is norwegian wood by haruki murakami i had not heard the beetle song in which
it kind of it kind of sits in i guess i'll say um and it's a story have you read that book um
norwegian wood button have you read any haruki murakami uh it's um he's a bit perverted but he's
but it's very weird and very like like he's like a PewDiePie recommend a little one stage and i
picked up kafka on the shore and i was amazed but that book hit me in like where the hole that i
would say a soul would be like it hit me it it changed me like i that book did something to me
and it's just fiction and it's about teen angst suicide depression anxiety love sex like it's
about all that kind of stuff and about some um some it's uh like some people in japan in the 80s
it's a great book but uh but so i guess my question is and someone said this in the comments so why
can't we like could you do that for the bible so where i kind of view the bible is somewhere in
between that um it's somewhere in between stormlight archives and like a history book it's somewhere
between there and i don't and every book is probably varied on like where it is like yeah yeah
i don't think samson caught two foxes and tied their tails together and let them on fire
i don't think that's real yeah at all i don't think the foxes could physically run not real
but what is real is this concept of a great and powerful man who had all the physical prowess
at his hands and at the end of the day he was brought to his knees and could only rely on faith
that story is real to me that means something to me because i'm not even a great powerful man
and i've been reduced to nothing but like god i hope things are true don't put down you don't put
yourself down you are a strong and powerful man thank you thank you okay coming out tomorrow okay
no uh yeah so i can agree with that and there's even stories like so one of the things that uh
dr josh brought up when he came on is um have you heard about the parallels between like the
epic of gilgamesh and yeah crazy love the story of gilgamesh it's super cool yeah and i haven't
applied and stuff like that yeah yeah so there's this is theory that that talks about the prime
evil history so between babel before babel all the way back is like a polemic against mesopotamian
society so the idea is like so there's one interpretation of the bible and that is those
things are true you know um no one built a magical zoo boat and it's all true and like koalas walked
all the way from australia and they got on and crawled away back and like all that stuff yeah um
but uh and then there's the interpretation well the allegories and stuff but the most
interesting interpretation and i think the one that's most likely true is when you know the israelites
were in captivity by the babelonians they were writing the story that was like fuck the babelonians
fuck mesopotamian society our god's different and they create this story so you know the epic of
gilgamesh is about like um towards civilization it's like uh ink you do you meet uh i'm gonna put
you the story but essentially like starts in the wilderness grows big goes towards civilization
civilization is a good thing but you read the bible and it's abraham like you know sotom and
gemora destroyed abraham goes around in tents like the the worst thing that humanity could do was
build a giant tower and god's like this is bad i'm gonna disperse the languages it's like very
anti civilization and it makes sense in the context of like well the babelonians were kind of
fucking with the the hebrus at the time that this makes sense that it was written down this makes
sense that it was a story written in a way to give um like ownership uh power um uh like taking back
like reclaiming their story to the hebrus and that makes sense and that's beautiful that's amazing
and that's how i kind of view it i viewed as like a natural view it as like a natural naturalistic
kind of naturalistic interpretation of the of the history it's like this is why it probably
happened it was a polemic against mesopotamian society i think that's so much more interesting
than god did it and you know don't worry about jericho probably didn't fall down when people
whistled around the wall for or sung around the wall for like it just and i i basically you know
the the painting of adam where they're like fingers touch with god that's how i view the bible
like the bible is somewhere in between this where like is it didactic history no obviously not
that's not how these people wrote their books that's not that's not the point of it fundamentalists
are fucking on crack to think that that's the point of this book it's not obviously but somewhere
in there the material in the physical mesh um and i don't know where exactly but um
i kind of see that touch point is like those moments of like awe those like moments of like
interpersonal meaning and maybe it's nothing i guess essentially i'm willing to take a step
off the cliff and i think it's super understandable if you're like eh i believe in all this is all
great but i i have a good view from the cliff i'm good i understand that but for me um i don't know
how i not step off the cliff essentially yeah but i guess i get going back to what we talked
about earlier but i guess this is where i get confused because you seem to be able to take a really
reason perspective on on that stuff from my perspective like a really nuanced perspective
of the bible why don't you just do that for this like you know you know slavery is wrong now like
you don't you're not going to say like slavery is cool like you know slavery is wrong you know
like certain things were like the you know like it's almost like it's insulting to imagine that
a god couldn't come up with a better system or like at least like encourage people a little
stronger in certain areas like why don't you just say that like yeah you know what it probably wasn't
good that you know every newborn in israel was to be killed by the angels like oh no in
egypt was to be killed by the angels like why not just say like these were stories written that
god wasn't involved in those things or like he was like he was just letting people be people
like as uh britney says humans are gonna human you know like what why why i guess why why i guess
bite the bullet on all the harsh shit but then like all the stuff that like isn't you know you
don't have to buy the bullet on you're like yeah it's probably made up like it's probably like
probably it's true but not true but you know like why why it just seems so much more easy if you
use it like not have to buy the bullet on that all that harsh shit and that's driving for easy
i'm striving for honest um i guess two parts number one i haven't looked down into those
laws so i just don't have like the i don't have the exegesis to comment on it um so i i the best
i can do is like theorize about it um i'd have to look into it it's possible that slavery was
necessary at the time like it's possible that without it you would have been surpassed and
annihilated by all of your neighbors maybe that's why god was willing to let the jews engage in this
because he didn't want the jews to be decimated um for like whatever reason i don't know um the
reason why i'm not willing to bite the bullet is because i think i think the worst thing that like
the archetypal libo christian does is just like the picket juice and i think if you're not willing
to bite the bullets on these things then you just are doing that um it's possible that god did
say yes to slavery for a period of time and i don't know what i think of that but i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna force god into like my zeitgeist of what it has to be i can't do that i can't do that
i don't know how to do that and say he's omniscient and infinite i don't know how to do that um it
feels like now i'm just making god be at the surface of 2023 liberal kyla and that's that's
not god if god if god is fully encapsulated by liberal 2023 kyla then he's me he's not god
and so i bite the bullet because i don't know um i haven't looked a bunch into the exegesis
there's possibly a bunch of reasons why it needed to happen and i don't think god is just nice i really
don't i haven't seen every evidence of god it's just like some he's just nice um
the west part of baptist posse used to say well the bible talks more about god's hate than it does
about his love so if you're a bible preacher you're preaching god's hate like so yeah um be careful
well the the thing is like i got one more quote and we'll end there but the thing is like the i've
said that in in the past that um you know i've said to like christians like stop teasing god like i'm
i'm natious and you're saying like and muslims christians muslims whatever i'm like stop teasing
god you're making god out to be like a moron who can't like come up with a better select
the fact that like if we put our heads together and we're like there's no way israel is going to be
like overtaken i mean you're just theorizing of course but like let's say like there's no way that
that um that israel is going to be overtaken unless they have slaves we're gonna have to allow
slavery like we could come up with a better solution okay maybe they're hired workers maybe
they're not slaves they're hired uh they can go whenever they want uh and they can they're given
a wage and they you know like we can or like maybe you can't beat them you know like maybe the
like we could come up with better things so it's like like i don't know please i don't know i i think
i think it's hubristic to assume that humans are good at social engineering i think like
one of the greatest fallacies that as a progressive that we fall upon and i am a progressive um is
that believing that social engineering society is simple and easy that you could just like do this
thing and it would be better it's never that simple it's never that simple and um
because there's this there's not just the wealth of things i know that i don't know but there's
also this massive wealth of things i don't know that i don't know this is why um it's actually
interesting looking into climate science really good climate scientists will tell you like one
of the worst things about prediction models is there's just a shitload of stuff we don't know
about the environment um if i'm talking about god how much more if there's lots of things we
don't know about neuroscience that we don't know about the heart god we don't know about the
fucking gut okay we don't know shit about the gut how much more is there that we don't know
about philosophy about social engineering about how society works um i want to be really cautious
to assume that it's just obvious you know um there's a really good source from the book you
know uh distrust uh you know question tradition but distrust the obvious um so i try to be
cautious about that and i am okay sitting in a state of discomfort i suppose okay i like that
okay last quote and this this um this is a quote it's a i think it's a christian
poem from the 16th century but it's quoted at the start of god it's not great one of my
favorite books by christopher hitchens oh i'm just gonna post the last part because it's the
only part that matters but the poem goes like this oh we're in some condition of humanity
born under one law to another bound vainly begot and yet forbidden vanity created sick
commanded to be sound and i'll just post that now so you can see it so and i want to ask you about
this so this is the the concept of original sin you're created sick commanded to be sound
uh and it goes back into i guess evolutionary biology and a young earth a young earth creationist
me could come to you and say you know if the earth is you know four billion years old and
life's been around why did heaven wait there with folded arms for 3.3 9999 billion years
and for the last 4 000 as writing became available popped down and said oh by the way um you know
there was this this is tree and these are the laws and donate shrimp and don't marry your sister and
like like what or you can marry your sister now but not anymore and like what it just seems like
where do you place us in the cosmos this is a big question what is the cosmos to you like what is
life like if we go back to astral pythesis have a soul like when did like the other
species of humans did they have souls were they going to heaven were they saved by jesus
if society and i'm getting a bit ranty here but if society picked up moved to mars
start living on mars and earth was like mainly like destroyed would jesus return to mars or
would he return to earth like we like you know we're like we're we're we're created sick commanded
to be sound like what is your overall philosophy about what the fuck we're doing on this earth
and like life in general okay i'm gonna give you the annoying answer and then i'll give you a better
answer um i think this is a really good sad to say a good question these are the questions i have
and what jesus said to the Sadducees when they said okay jesus say i'm married that person dies
and i get remarried legally am i married to both when i go to heaven and i'm pretty sure jesus says
bro shut the fuck up i'm pretty sure that's uh verbatim what's it about yeah yeah yeah yeah
bro i think that's bro shut the fuck up but he basically rolls his eyes and he's like you're
missing the point bro like that that don't worry about this um you're missing the point if you're
worrying about this and so basically um i guess my answer to this would be i don't know um i'm just
not really worried about it i guess like if i i guess like my faith is very childlike in this
way i believe that god is good and i believe that he loves me and i believe that he loves all of
creation and i don't know where that leads me or that leaves you or the atheist that the next
atheist that i love i have no idea um but i believe that god is good and i believe that if i
for some reason was able to access all of the knowledge and information the infinite amounts
of it needed to make the determination about whether god would end up in mars or here or there in that
that i would be like okay that makes sense that's essentially my assumption um about the way that
god engages and i feel like every time i engage in exegesis i get a similar feeling where i'm like
okay that makes sense um and so i guess that's not the best most satisfying answer but essentially
it's like the all pan like by theory is like it's all gonna pan out because i deeply deeply to the
core me there's like one axiom that i have which is that god is good i really believe that in a
really deep rich like when i say that i picture a tree with deep roots um god is good in the way
that i mean like it's not simple it's not surface it's rich and rounded and beyond my comprehension
but i guess fundamentally i trust in that and i understand if you don't but that's just where i'm at
okay that you're very well speaking for someone who's so drunk
um that's true but um i can't fit my lips so i'm just super well spoken
that's that's awesome this is what i was really enjoyable for for me kyla i hope you've enjoyed
it i'll end on one last question this is a question i haven't asked for a while but i used to ask it
to every guest what's the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in
uh i want to say buddhism but it's not really a religion yeah i'm gonna make it everyone chooses
buddhism i'm gonna say because most mainly the atheist so let's say theistic religion like islam
hinduism oh boy uh probably hinduism oh okay why yeah um oh yeah cool cool like that god is one god
he's definitely not the islamic god that guy sucks okay
oh
clear someone clip it clip it clip it send it to daniel chikachu
um Sikhism also really falls towards kind of that like extremist i don't know there's so much
like extremist negativity that comes out of there although to be fair my knowledge of Sikhism
is less than my knowledge of hinduism because hinduism is like god is kind of in everything
it's kind of like new agey this this let me just start interrupting you but there's this temple in
um in Sikhism that they they they give out vegetarian meals um like give it like a huge
amount every day i forgot how much it is it's um let me just quickly share this they like give out
it's like all just volunteers is giving up free meals um this temple and the golden temple
oh she's got how many meals it is it's like it's it's thousands
kind of but it's always religious people who do like almost all of the
non-profit work it's kind of crazy uh yeah maybe that or yesians was that considered a religion
if that yesians i'd be down with the yesians for um oh the yesians yeah the yesians and then
Judaism 100 000 meals a day sorry sorry wow there's the Islamic uh kind of pagans who do a lot of
like circle dancing and prayers yeah i can't remember the name of it maybe that yeah they're
cool they have like not for a good reason at this point i'm just i'm just being like oh it's fun
dads around being like nomadic in the desert but yeah it's um it is interesting how these like
fallos like there are there you seem to go for the fringes like you don't you're not like into
the mainstream like you're not going to choose like Islam you choose a fringe Islam um power wrecks
religion so yeah yeah for sure and politics wrecks religion there's a reason i don't want the state
to be melded to the church and i think it's because it ruins the church not because it
ruins the yeah yeah well um yeah i agree a lot of your content's quite political-esque um uh
let me just quickly shout out your channel one last time what have you got coming up that people
can look forward to um checking out but i'm starting a podcast with uh steven um
yeah it's called bridges we're very excited um i have a bunch of yeses from people and no dates
so i'm hoping to start by january uh that's amazing it'll be like interviews and panels
that are probably mostly political in nature but probably where the social meets political to
political um so that's really exciting i'm doing a lot of behind the scenes work these days which
is why i'm stringing a lot less because i do like eight hours a day of um just um i'm i really
like networking and i really like talking to streamers and kind of supporting them from the
back end so i've fallen into a couple of roles that complement that which is why i've been streaming
us i'll be on the whatever podcast again soon probably me and brian hit it off so i'll be around
um i don't know iral content is just my bread and butter i'm so much better at it for some reason
i don't know why but if i have a person to talk to it's like my charisma comes out whereas if i
have like just a camera i'm just i think yeah yeah the part of the it's the real big dance
i've been in australia is a lot of the guests i talked to in america and um otherwise i would
be pushing to get like a live studio um going for deep drinks because i think of um it's it
adds so much more to it especially drinking um not that every guest has to drink i see mdma on
your podcast you got the best conversation i've never i've never done mdma i've never i've only
done i've had some lsd a tiny amount and weight that's all i've ever done okay mdma is just like
i i don't even want to do anything but mdma is so a very small amount it's just like you're
like do you want to have a deepy and people like yeah i love it yeah um well um i look forward to
seeing uh you and steven's podcast that sounds awesome i love i watch destiny a lot uh and uh
watch you a lot as well so that'd be that'd be great to see well guys thanks for everyone for
