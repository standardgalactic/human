If you're wondering what it's like to have Christmas down under in Australia,
well, it's like nine in the morning and it'll be about 30 degrees Celsius,
which is about 86 degrees Fahrenheit where I live on the Sunshine Coast.
Cooking eggs for breakfast on the barbecue.
A lot of people do prawns and go to the beach and drink beers all day.
Where you are in the world, what do you guys do specifically for Christmas?
Is there any like traditions or family traditions?
Leave it in the comments down below.
