dīpa today we have a really special guest and we're going to jump straight into it so nidi is our
guest and nidi isn't at the animated atheist who as it has long form conversations about religion
cults evangelicals and apologetics on his youtube channel nidi was part of dwell community church
which was a huge home group based church that believes in spiritual gifts a literal satan
as an adversary to mankind like a real thing not like an idea salvation through faith
eternal judgment for those who refuse salvation or don't get salvation and the imminent return
of jesus christ alongside the destruction of the world nidi has become a personal friend of mine
and i'm so honoured to welcome nidi to deep drinks podcast welcome nidi
oh can you hear me yeah okay so that was so weird the my computer like
throws up right before and i was like oh and i realized the page and then just as it moved to like
my video coming on i chucked in there so oh that was all just tough but well good welcome nidi this is
great thanks for coming on the channel hey doorknob head uh so what's everyone drinking tonight
and what more importantly nidi what are we drinking we are drinking coffee liqour mudslides
coffee liqour mudslides and so you were originally going to be on camera but we've had some
we had some issues and we you thought we'll actually work works well for you because you're
normally um the anaman at atheist so this all makes sense right um so you've got your drink
set up i don't have my drink set up but i'm gonna set it up now so there's two shots of vodka
right one shot of kalua and then some coffee creamer so i've got all those things ready to go
indeed and a few people in the chat use it by his other known name slavo you bring
yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah so um so nidi how have you been as i get this drink poured uh
last night i was rather sleepy if you caught that but no i'm good i'm good i can't complain
too much i mean work is uh work so you know but uh the time and place talk about that what
what do you do for work if you don't mind me asking yeah yeah i'm a web developer
so getting into the online uh debate space is pretty easy in that regard right because i can
run videos all day long that's why you can see me pop into different chats and kind of streams
i was always wondering why you were doing why you would like you're always like you're always there
i was always wondering yes i am your algorithm boost whether you like me or not
thank you uh thanks everyone for showing up this is really cool what is everyone what else
everyone else drinking for the night i've got my uh my drink here it's uh gonna give it a first taste
i haven't tasted this yet that's delicious that's really that's deadly that's deadly
so um nidi you're not a christian anymore are you no so i stretch it
yeah so uh i'm i'm trying to make sure that this channel doesn't become like an atheist
i've got a bunch of um atheist friends who want to come on and i've had to actually pump the brakes
because i don't want this to just be an atheist talk show i want to have conversations with all
people different people with different faiths and ideas and beliefs and things like that but um
but i really want to learn more about your story um before i start um reaching out to to more um
people with different ideas but can you tell us a little bit about like growing up like how did
you grow up a christian how did you get involved in dwell church can you give us like a um uh a uh your back story
yeah absolutely so i grew up um in the cleveland area actually and my mom was raised catholic
and my dad uh was raised a heathen but no seriously he so like an actual heathen or like
uh well no but um he would tell me stories though about since they're um my family's last name is demons
and so for their town parade they would dress all the children in little devil costumes
and put them in a cage on the back of a flatbed truck and parade them around the town as the little demons
so why is your is your last name really demons
it for real for real yeah wow is that why is that is that like a normal it's like a common name
or is that just like no it's super uncommon um okay so back in the uh late 1800s early 1900s
when there was mass immigration to the united states a lot of customs workers were just
kind of racist or nonchalant about how they uh dealt with people's names and so the reason there's
so many darn smiths johnson's uh and things like that in america is because someone would come over
from overseas right they'd say their beautiful given last name they'd say tomas de montes
and they'd be like yep thomas demons get your ass in here
or my my my mom's family has a really beautiful and this is not her last name anymore and i'm not
going to give you your maiden name so i can't get fully doxed here but it was um mattus eddish
and they shortened that to something you know totally bastardized wow that's crazy yeah yeah
happened all the time and so that's why you have um different spellings of essentially the same
last german family name things like that like obaer meyer became over meyer over meyer like it
there's a whole bunch of stuff like of a lot like how families right ended up with without their actual
you know um heritage or history for anyway anyway we're way off topic but that's what we
do here that's why sites like ancestry are so cool because you're able to step back through that and
figure out you know when that kind of thing happened in your family yeah i recently got my um
ancestry information back what's really interesting though is mine differs from my mom's and i didn't
realize this about genetics but um like my mom can like my mom could have a certain amount of
like italian heritage ethnic heritage in her but it might not get passed on to me uh but it might
get passed on to my brother so like it's it's it was it was really strange like my mom my little
brother has like a more olives complexion than i do um and that was i think he hasn't done an
ancestry test but i would imagine that he has more of the italian um bloodline than i do is that a
cat neat yeah it's my cat rosy she um she's actually been running around the house goofing around
most of the day and then at the end of the day she wants her cuddles and played with she actually
is more like a dog than a cat because she like when she's bored or lonely she'll go get her cat toy
and drag it through the house and bring it next to me and then look at me like a puppy dog
play with me i've never had a cat ever do that ever in my life it's so funny i always say that people
people people who say that the cats are awesome describe their cats as dogs like oh it's so good
it's so good this cat's like a dog it's like right yeah and my other cat uh evie is just an ornery
bitch she like wants like unconditional love one moment and then you'll be petting her and she
just turns into an complete nutter fur demon and like scratches your leg and bites you and jumps off
of you all claws out so your legs get all bloody yeah i love i love wrestling with cats to do that
always end up with lots of scratches so but back to your story um yeah yeah so i grew up uh my mom
had like the what she just we know would describe as the uh mountain of catholic guilt
to get me into some kind of church experience as a kid so we ended up at the start like being
creasters right we would go for christmas and easter and my mom was kind of loosey goosey
with like spiritual beliefs she had tarot cards and like wanted to be christian and wanted to
believe in god and jesus and stuff like that but she was into tarot too and then she didn't think
much of it right um and then later she tried to get us to have more community and friends
and we had this i had this aunt um who became like a born again christian in the 90s
and there was a lot of guilt coming from that side of the family for my mom to uh basically
reconvert in some sense to christianity and to like repent of her tarot cards and like
change her life up and get us in church right and so she tried taking me to youth groups and stuff but
by that time i was a weird enough kid that i just didn't fit in at all and i got made fun of a lot
and like i just didn't click with those kinds of kids because i also didn't know what the heck they
were talking about like i wasn't going there because i wanted to be a part of church right i was
going there because mommy dropped me off and there was nothing better for me to do so it just
didn't click with me i didn't everything that i heard there or learned there just kind of like
in one ear and out the other right it just didn't um resonate me at that time at all with me at
at that time at all was that what what type of youth group was it was it like a um um non-denominational
just like a bunch of like they tried to like put you in your like grade school bubble and like in
the states right we have um smaller pods right of elementary middle and high school right so the
youth groups would be broken down in that kind of general bubble right you'd have your fifth and sixth
graders together so that's like eight no sorry like nine to eleven year olds and then you got your
uh six to eighth graders together or something like that which is like your 13 to 15 16 year olds
or no so 15 year olds and then high school is just 15 and whatever so yeah that's how
those were generally broken up um but this church in particular it was like a middle school age
and then in high school we kind of fell off the wagon with that stuff when a bunch of stuff happened
in my family um my parents separated uh we almost a lot well we lost our house um and we're almost
homeless uh for a little while and we were basically like um given the opportunity to live with a
in the one side of a duplex that like my friend's family owned at like a reduced rent so that we
could get back on our feet um and i did pretty well in school so i was able to get a half scholarship
to a menonite college um and so i went to a menonite college and at this menonite school uh i learned
about there were required christian classes so we had to take intro to biblical literature uh
we had to choose like one of three christian or bible electives or whatever but it was like
still required um and i chose like the history of christianity like of early christianity and then i
had to take a um like bible ethics class or something like that and it's kind of like a liberal
arts school so it definitely is not coming at the bible in these classes with like a fundamentalist
bend or like a young earth creationist bend or anything like that it's pretty it's a pretty
liberal school and a pretty like open minded place and they try to be like one like kind of tenant
of being a menonite or an idea that was populated to me about being menonite is you're always pursuing
peace right peace over everything so like you know you're gonna do your best to tolerate love and
respect people even if at the end of the day they don't believe in jesus the same way that you do
right or at all when i google menonite it comes up with like horse and carriage and like what looks like
almost um like amish right so the the menonites in the us are and canada are like i describe them as
the amish who are allowed to drive minivans like the end they can vary in flavor and intensity
like your kind of evangelical christian too right okay or or like your your quality of real
cacao chocolates right you got the 90 percent and you got your you know what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah
yeah so were you part of the menonites like like like did you wear the outfits and stuff like
were you like no no no no no no no no no no no so in the college um again liberal arts school
and if you're just not from the states you kind of don't see how it's almost like you gotta
pull back the curtain in a way and like get down in the weeds there it's kind of like
being in like small town america in a way um but you know big city kids end up there and you can
still wear whatever you can still um go to chapel or not go to chapel and things like that
but uh there were you know more fundamentalist menonites i would say or like and or conservative
menonites that went who did wear like the little white um hair bond eddy skull cappy thing i don't
know the real name for it um and men who uh very were much less common who wore just overalls all the
but for the most part even the lifelong menonite professorship uh people in professorship there
didn't weren't that conservative at all but they still tried to hang on to uh
the menonite ideals of like peace and community respect and uh fostering dialogue and things like that
so that was cool like it was never like you know you have to be a christian to go here right
but we really would prefer it yeah yeah right you're definitely in an in group if you go to
chapel and you're in a different kind of group when you don't go to chapel right yeah um and i ended
up in that kind of like social niche there um though i did um meet some christians who tried to
convert me to christianity while i was in college there um one in particular i got in extremely
depressed in college and i was suicidal for a time and i had a young gentleman like praying over me
uh for me to like know god's love and experience him and i remember crying
in this like you know jack dude's arms and feeling weird about it uh and and just being like yeah
maybe something real happened there and i went to church for like two weeks and then you know quick going
like after exams and he graduated that was the end of that um but uh yeah and then
i met my now wife there uh we dated um we didn't play by any particular christian rules
we broke a lot of the rules of the christian rule like they had rules like um no no men after 10
like you can't have uh the opposite sex uh in the dorm room after 10 p.m. yeah there's a no opposite
sex mondays so we would call that no pants monday or you could just walk around
that's so bizarre that's so bizarre obviously it was a quote unquote dry campus so me and my buddy
would say we're going to the library which was code for we're going to the liquor store
that's so good that's so good so um was was your wife who at the time was she religious at all
she actually grew up uh Mormon for a time okay and then their family kind of fell out of good
graces with that church because her dad uh kind of was promiscuous okay and then uh yeah so that
didn't work out um among other reasons for them and that but that's her story you know uh yeah and she
in general though did really want to like love jesus or love god to some extent and want like a godly
marriage and things like that um and so going into our relationship i think um that was like an
ideal that she had like growing up but you know reality is different and she kind of accepted that
thing but um yeah so i ended up i graduated in like 2008 um and i knew about um like some of the
basic arguments for god like the ontological argument uh the cosmological argument um that
people were really convinced in ancient history that jesus like did all the things and a church
started you know here we are right um for those could you just give a quick uh synopsis of those
two arguments oh crap on a cracker um okay but just so apologist can say that you never had a
true understanding and then go oh fine put pieces of you so the ontological argument is
if it's possible that a maximally great being exists in some possible world
um it exists in all possible worlds therefore a maximally great being exists done okay all right
i'm i'm bastardizing it a bit because i know it's six premises but they're all they all sound
the same so whatever i've heard all of them in like different different way of like but i
don't know the names like i don't know what ontological i don't know why that's the ontological
argument um and the cosmological argument uh is like a bit more that's the funner one i think um yeah
uh whatever begins to exist has a cause if the universe uh began to exist its cause
is god therefore uh well the universe began to exist therefore it's causes god
yeah therefore there's a cause and then and then they go okay so if there's a cause
we can imagine that cause to be god because even i still own i still own on guard by
william lang craig i could go get the book well i do want to um look into william lang craig's books
because um i don't think i think he's all over the place but i think that some of the stuff he says
isn't all that crazy um i think it's less crazy yeah um so anyway okay so yeah we're at college
yeah yeah so i left college right without any like formal kind of christian belief right i just
was kind of living my life doing my thing uh being wacky it's good it was good time so it's good
time and um i ran into this girl uh in like the stairwell of my parents condominium my mom's step
dance condominium and she stopped me and was like hey are you a believer and i'm like in what
what kind of question is that why no one posed it to me that way before right um and she's like
in jesus silly i'm like okay um no i mean well in what sense like was there a dude sure you know
and she's like well you should come check out my bible studies i'm like okay fine and so like
i go to her um bible study and it's like this young adult thing in the cleveland area
and i uh hi jenna um and it's true i do i do love them oh so much yeah so jenna jenna
pipes in says did you all know nitty loves titties so um i don't know if that's inside
joke or she's just informing everyone anyway um so uh where was i oh right so i mean
it just really struck me that like people who were young could be doing almost anything else with
their time want to get together and hash through the meaning of the bible what it what it does for
them in their life it it it does muster up this like deep uh not deep but like curiosity in you
right when you see people like with their own kind of language of how to talk about the bible how to
talk about life how to talk to each other um how they try to sue each other um and you know quote
unquote be there for each other they or love on each other right there's something yeah yeah
there's there isn't uh in alluring nature to that right and you know when you're christian you call
that the aroma of jesus we just gotta exude the aroma of christ okay i never heard that that's
what kind of gross yeah that that makes me feel uncomfortable the aroma of jesus that's uh
huh it's it's biblical man it's uh what is it uh first chrithians or second chrithians where
paul says uh we're like uh yeah we are like the aroma of christ to some we're the stench of death
and to others for the beautiful scent of lake maybe that's this maybe i'm the stench of death
then maybe that's why i'm thinking it's gross because it's the stench of death to me now
maybe it's true yeah bible proved 100 fact but the um oh man we we used to say like having
an encounter with god or um or like it was like uh i need like people would say i'm going to
Bethel a Bethel night of blah blah blah because they my church was some of my people at my church
are called the Bethelers they're obsessed with the Bethel church in america they thought oh yeah yeah
more godly than the the hill songs and the planet shakers and the other churches around
so um they'll be like i need this right now and encounter with god like all powerful like it's just
yeah so popular kind of stuff um got second chrithians too for we are the aroma of christ to god
among those who are saved and to among those who are perishing to one the fragrance from death to death
the other from light to light you have to give it to you have to give it to the bible that there
is some really cool stuff like oh yeah ideas and i think i want to um i want to do a panel um and
we may be doing some panels in the future on this channel um deep drinks panels that's don't tell
anyone um but i want to do a panel where we have a bunch of um ex religious people from different
faiths talking about beautiful verses in like the Quran and in the bible things like that it just
be so weird like a bunch of atheists talking about it yeah great anyway yeah so i got allured
by that yeah yeah i got involved in it and i really really needed a job okay like because this is right
when it was the beginning hey darren um this is right when the economy went to the pupil during
the obama administration and everyone was you know but hurt for a job and post college was just
rough as all get out to try and uh get over the bootstrap paradox that basically happens to you
in america where you need a job to have experience and you need experience to have a job right so until
one of those is just handed to you you are out of luck right someone has to take the gamble on you
so that you can become quote unquote professional right or to get into an industry
or the other classical way that this is for like high school age people it's like
i need a car to have a job but i need a job to have a car right yeah it's like and it happens to people
who just come of age and graduate too they can't live with their damn parents anymore but they don't
have enough shit to get their life started but they don't have enough shit because they're
yeah it's like this rock oh yeah but anyway um so they encouraged me at this uh little community
group to pray to get a job and like you know it took a couple weeks and i don't know posting
my resume places but an opportunity presented itself and you know i yeah oh yeah and i drove
down to columbus got an interview um and apparently like the position was originally going
to be an internship but i got it um and everyone's like yay you know nitty's got a job you know
we're gonna pray for him and help him find a church you know wherever he moves and he'll
be great it'll be great um and during that time too i picked up um a tactic for reading the bible
called the love method method have you ever heard of that no so you get a journal and you write
l o v e like so uh you start with the l you're supposed to learn something from the passage you
read you suppose this is amazing observe something about the passage and then oh what's the
no um it's been like you know over a decade your church sounded a little bit no no no this
is this is still from the cleveland uh okay yeah yeah anyway and then um the e i know was
express right and then yeah like you're supposed to like write about how um this verse applies to
your life right and how god is you know speaking to you through what you've um what you've read um
yeah so yeah it it was just like journaling practice that they wanted me to take with me
and i still have um those journals from like 13 or so years ago um of you know what my
thoughts on the bible and what it was saying to me and things like that um and then so i was kind
of feeling pretty aimless and depressed again you know i basically lost all my major friend groups
and things like that by moving to kind of the danky area of uh columbus because i didn't have much
money so like every night you know it's police irons gunshots and um you know the gas stations
with the glass so that you know they don't get mugged and stuff um god yeah it's a good time
it really creeped my uh fiance slash now wife out you know to visit that part of town because
she had never really been in the city where you know they had that kind of uh level of protection
and stuff going on on a regular basis but i uh i'm working there i love my job it's a lot of
fun and but i'm still like pretty lonely and like depressed and i like make some facebook posts
like i'm feeling real listless and lost and i don't know what to do and a lot because like i'm a very
if you know me from my channel or twitter or whatever i'm a very expressive person it actually
takes a lot for me that when something is going on in my life to not kind of like like let everyone
know uh so i i try to be as open to honest about what's going on in my life as possible
and um so a friend that i went to the menonite school with reached out to me and was like hey
you should check out this church in columbus man it's like people your age they you know
they're excited for the lord i met them in new orleans on a missions trip that they they might
be a good fit for you man here's an email address to somebody go check it out so
i'm like alright so um i posted on facebook maybe god is trying to hunt me down like a raptor
right this becomes significant later um and uh i check out this i reach out to this person
i've never met before and they respond to my email and they're like yeah come come check out
our bible study be so awesome if you can i'm like cool so they give me the address it's on osu's campus
and i roll up and i get out of my car and the first thing i see is this dude in this
black leather hat black trench coat smoking a cigarette you know just vibe in on this porch
you know in the fall and i'm like uh is this uh is this so-and-so's house and he's like
yeah how do you know him i'm like i don't but are you having a bible study he's like
oh yeah man come on in and he's like twirling his mustache he's like he looks like uh like a
bullwinkle villain right like that's so good yeah but he was he actually ended up becoming a
really good friend of mine because when i saw him inside my head i'm like these are my people
yeah because i was like a goth kid growing up and like you know the weird one like i was literally
nicknamed a weird kid in middle school so like all right if this is the kind of person who can check
this out and be at home here like yeah yeah and then i go in like my mom used to always say that
she's too bent for the straights and too straight for the vents like she needs somewhere like in the
middle uh and i feel like that like my mom and and probably i would get along with people like that as
well like a little bit worldly but still like on you know they're not you know doing math yeah people
that don't want to be like completely overtly bananas right yeah so yeah um i go in and it's like
yeah a bunch of people who are kind of motley like me in some ways um you know no one's like super
sexy you know everyone's just kind of um your average joe's or maybe pretty nerdy about things
and i remember you know listening to the way that it was like that having that experience all over again
of that um you know the way that they talked about the bible the way that they prayed the way that
they seemed to take a uh genuine interest in you uh especially when you're new i mean i had people
like clamoring to talk to me right and i thought i was just like overwhelmed by that right because it
being um uh being like kind of an you know most of my life being on the outside of a lot of social
circles um and not experiencing that real direct uh communication and attempt to identify you know
what i really thought and parse through my ideas and um you know um taking it seemingly taking
interest in my life and my hobbies and my likes and my dislikes and my journey um really impacted
me because i i really liked those kind i still i mean if you go on my channel you know i love
these kinds of conversations right where we can talk about uh deeply personal issues esoteric ideas
crazy ideas spiritual ideas i just love this stuff right and and getting in the weeds with all of it
and so finding a bunch of people my age that want to hammer through this stuff uh and do it for hours
i was like all right cool like this is pretty cool and the more i came around uh the more you know
they responded in kind right they like hey you know do you need help with anything this weekend
you know let's let's spend some time together you know a couple guys asked me to go to a coffee
shop and read the bible with them and i'm like okay and so we read romans one and then they asked me
who is this talking about and i was like oh it's talking about like christian hypocrites
like fox news and stuff like because that's my how rudimentary my bible knowledge even though i had
taken like a history of christianity class right i didn't read the bible like cover to cover very
regular yeah i don't know many christians who have read the bible cover to cover i don't know many
christians who even read the bible to be honest at all interesting but yeah i uh so i um
you know i'm going there for a couple months at this point and i uh remember you know feeling
like i'm getting quote unquote closer and closer to these guys that are my age and younger
you know people in college and hearing this proposition that i need to just invite jesus into my heart
that i need to have a relationship with god and something about it
like i would describe it as like quote unquote clicked for me then and i was listening to a teaching on
first timothy one fifteen sixteen um where it's like if god displayed his immense mercy for me
you know a murderer paul you know how much more mercy does he have for everyone else and
as a person who is like viewed themselves as like an outcast and it's like a
a person who you know didn't always live up to their own standards i'm like wow like
maybe there is a bunch of stuff i need forgiveness for maybe you know i i do need this right
and somebody asked me after the small group discussion like hey do you want to invite christ
to near a heart and i'm like yeah let's do it and so like he led me through like this kind of prayer
type experience of like you know you just have to say god if you really died in the cross for me
for my sins and my shortcomings you know come into my heart and he'll do it i'm like okay and so we
did that and i remember crying and then you know him give me this big hug and being like welcome
brother you know like it's like and he's like now everything's different man everything's changed
you know you're you're this new person in jesus christ now that you've done this taking the
step of faith right and you're gonna feel like god's presence in your life and it's gonna be amazing
right and i'm just like okay yeah did you did they i used to always say because i think it happened
to me when i had in the spiritual experience was there are angels celebrating in heaven right now
they're having a party for like yeah yeah that language came later like when when uh i'll get to that
part too so like um i remember driving home to my ratty apartment not worrying about a thing
like like everything's good i could just die tonight whatever
and that's a you know weird feeling when you're like 23 right um and maybe you know
i've got a youtube friend i guess you call him a friend i don't know but you'd be like that's the
assurance nitty how can you be denying that now right um like well so uh but once you make that
kind of decision the dynamics of all your social engagements completely change with those people
because now you're one of them right you're in you have and they're getting a lot of this
from the bible right where it says like if you are in christ you are a new creation second
Corinthians five um when you are in christ you're adopted into god's family Ephesians one three
through uh 13 14 right you're marked in him with the promised holy spirit it's a seal guaranteeing
your redemption of those who are god's possession um you are a child of god and we all share these
fundamental qualities that are inalienable to you once you are a true christian right uh first
john three one uh see how great the love of god that we are now his children or something like that
um so they really would draw upon scripture to be their external authority in that regard
to kind of cement you into uh that kind of new identity language that rebranding of yourself
and that is how they would then change the way that your relationships kind of work right there's
new expectations now too that you're a christian right since you have the holy spirit you you ought to be
able to agree that you need more time with christians right because if we're god's family we have to learn
how to love the right way right and we gotta learn how to love together the right way so why don't
you check out our men's bible study group so at this point i was already going to a monday night thing
and a thursday night thing and you know come to this friday night thing i'm like it's a bunch of dudes
hanging out and when you get the drink afterwards okay yeah sounds great the the the thing too is do you notice
that when you get more and more involved because that that initial uh experience of giving your life
to christ or that spiritual thing that happens or whatever you have this like huge boost of like
energy and zest for life but eventually that starts to fade right and eventually the conversation starts
to talk about you need to keep that you you need to like work hard at like keeping it going so
you need to attend church you need to read the bible you need to pray you need to like
force yourself to work hard at your relationship with god um no longer is it something that's like
you're looking forward to and you're waking up like when i first got saved i would wake up
in prayer or i'd wake up thinking about the bible straight away and want to read the bible but eventually
it was such like it was hard it was really hard and i had to like work at it and became like this
thorn in my side like the belief here and it was hard to do uh and you go through this like
you know you have those moments where and you feel good at the end of a worship session or a prayer session and then
you know a few days later you you like i don't want to go and then you go back and then they call this the the um
fighting the flesh right like fighting you know the spirit and the flesh are fighting all the time the principalities
yeah yeah um yeah yeah totally and that's something that we would and i'm going to shift to using we now because
this is something that um so let me try and get up to speed to that we part so um i start going to that
and then you know seeing how
how how much value is placed on learning the bible and becoming like an expert in it in this community
and the how much um i don't want to call it fame but i guess that's like a
an easy way to put it um or notoriety you get from trying to reach out to people evangelize to them
and then have people under you that you study with that you teach the bible to
and hopefully in uh to do the process of um i think it's like uh
in first timothy too right teach reliable men who will then teach others right this idea of
replication is so important to this uh group and so highly valued
that you need to be replicating yourself right and if you're doing it you're extolled
in the community you're viewed as a valuable asset for god you're viewed as uh uniquely gifted
and i wanted to pursue that right i wanted to be since i was the outcast right for most of my life
now i get to be this in member this leader this influencer this um
evangelist this righteous good person who's able to you know affect an eternal change
in people right when when the rest of my life felt like just this dumbass hamster wheel of pushing
code that gets deleted in two years or whatever right and so uh yeah uh so i worked really really hard
becoming exactly that i've taken uh probably hundreds of hours of their bible classes easily
like at least my college the amount of hours i spent in college classes is lower than the amount
of hours i spent in christian classes like bible now adjacent so for sure so is this there was this
home group that you're part of is this the dwell that you were talking about yeah okay okay yeah yeah and so um easily
i mean i i can't even tell you how many times you know i've talked about calvinism armenianism
you know the structures of different denominations and why we didn't have that and oh my gosh it it really
it's crazy we can talk more about that later but um so at some point though you go through all that training
right over the years and i taught a few different people who came and went throughout the church i
you know and gave quote-unquote gave my life to them and building them up in the faith and things like that
and when you're doing that you can eventually become like a small men's group leader
right and yeah that's almost exactly what it looks like and um yeah you become a uh
you know small home church teacher right or a sit-in leader and then a leader right of a home group
where you're able to influence like 30 people in your close community
um so yeah uh and i was doing everything i could to pursue that and i remember teaching things like
when you witness someone receive christ there's a party in heaven
the angels are dancing god has so much joy over one sinner who repents i mean have he even read luke 15
can i get an amen right and we had in the college age uh ministry they send out an email basically
every time someone makes a commitment to jesus so like they'll blur out their name for privacy
i don't know if they still do this but they definitely did um so and they and they would give out
all the details of like um you know what that person's um hang-ups were with god right
or christianity and like how they work through those things and then ta-da they got converted
and praise god and they're so excited to read their bibles and things like that um and the other
thing that we would do is in our prayer groups like instead of the email right it would be like
well jackie's coming to our church and she's questioning her sexuality so
if there's a teaching on sex you know don't bring it up let her bring it up right and like
that would get voiced to like a prayer group of people without her consent right yeah and no that
uh like the night that i had my spiritual experience my spiritual experience at the youth
group there there was a bunch of youth at the front praying for me because i didn't want to go
up the front they were praying in a circle to like pray for me and they finally got the courage
these youth to come up and prophesy over me um but looking back i'm like they would have known
about me because like one of the youth girls like you know would have told told them about me so
they would have known that like i was the depressed kid at school and yada yada and then
coincidentally all the things they're prophesying are in line with how i'm feeling i know that you
feel like you don't matter i know that you know and it's just like they share stuff behind the scenes
they don't realize like it's not like a devious it's not nefarious yeah yeah and i make that clear
there's a video i have on my channel about it's a it's a hot reading tactic basically right
um and in the homo eletics class that is offered through them
you're instructed to use heat and light in your bible teachings and the heat is
purposefully sitting down and thinking about how does this bible passage speak to the situations
going on in my home group here go is this a passage about money when so and so just bought a car
right is this a passage about money when so and so just you know took a very expensive vacation
right or or spent you know on something frivolous or i view as frivolous then yeah this is my
opportunity to bring heat to them right and you know or like is this a um a bible teaching about
acceptance or belonging well yeah we've got a lot of kids who are socially outcasted in this group
so we should definitely do this bible teaching right so that we can bring the heat and the relevance
of god's word into their lives right it's no different than these people who pay like a hundred
dollars to go see a psychic and the psychic gets all their ticket information looks them up on
facebook and says i'm seeing someone related to a tom who has a pickup truck right yeah and that
shit is because their friend their friend or their brother-in-law is named tom with a
freaking pickup truck in his profile picture right it's the same shit it's just dressed up
in biblical trappings right well i remember uh do you know who regi dabs is no his is really
really really good speaker and he speaks to teens all the time now he's like a preacher
really really funny really like he's a cool dude but one of the things he did at a
planet shakers conference i was you know so we're in a room for all the room for thousands of people
3000 people and they're all teens and he does his sermon and people are like you know praying and
like the altar calls happened that you can't listen there's not enough room for an altar call so
you just stayed in your seats but um but you know everyone's you know crying and raising hands
and the other stuff he runs back on stage interrupts the band and he's like god told me that if i wanted
to go to sleep tonight i needed to tell i needed to say this and everyone's like whoa and like i don't
think that he was trying to mislead anyone i think that maybe he really felt god say this
and he's like there's someone in this room who has something in their pocket and god doesn't
want them to have that in their pocket now that could be so many things and he talks about like
you know us being two different people being someone with our friends versus someone at church
that could be so many things that could be a smartphone that someone was looking at porn on that
could be drugs that could be um you know a phone number in a phone of of the boy that the girl knows
that she shouldn't be messaging um that could be it could be anything right because it's relatable
to absolutely everyone in that in that group um wow it could be the money like maybe they
maybe they felt like they should give all their money to the time yeah or even just even just like
maybe i should have given more money to the titan offerings like so like there's there's there's no
way for that not to hit and then as a result obviously the room erupts like um in in um in that
but it's the same thing but as these these um these uh you know mediums and stuff but i feel like
for the for most of the time i i don't think they realize like i don't think they're doing it
nefariously i don't think they're like how do we get them to have a more crazy experience i think
it's is genuine most the time um anyway yeah and that's how i view my own actions right in in taking
these kinds of steps right it's this is how i defined loving a person is letting the community
know how they can help yeah or right or um how i can uh you know work in concert with god to bring
the truth and power of his message into their into their life and the same kind of process would be
used for you know the uh the idea of using scripture to rebuke someone right yeah so you
know you witness someone's actions and you're like hey man hey brother you know you did this thing
and here's what god has to say about it you know what do you think about that um you know i think
you should repent but hey who am i like um yeah there's and there's also like we used to have
the same thing with um homosexuality right like so i had um people say well it's not love to just
say it's okay like it's it's love to tell them that that's a sin that stop them from going to heaven
that's love because you're telling them the truth um and so i can see where they're coming from
but at the same time um they can fuck right off in my opinion like i don't i know it's coming from
they might think it's coming from a good place and everything but i've got too many gay friends that
that has ruined their life so they can fuck right off in my opinion yeah and i actually got flak um
a couple of times in that community for trying to be more
engaged with the uh you know non-straight community in columbus which is rather large
and reach out and evangelize to those people um i would and part of it was because they viewed
uh some of it was because maybe one person might have been attracted to me right and
i'm not responsible for that so what do i care right like i don't know but then the other
part of the problem was you know they want to be this community is weird right i would say that it's like
there's something deep inside them that wants to be fundamentalist and like
ardent and inflexible but at the same time they really are averse to taking on those kinds of
hard stances and so it's totally random when the hammer comes down on you for something right
and it's usually just up to like the subjective preferences of the particular group you're in
as to how much discipline or flak you'll get for something that just goes a little bit too far or
was that one slip up too many times or whatever um or this idea that you're trying to hold on to that they
just can't accept as like a valid theological proposition um you know you might be able to get
away with it for a while if you're like a home church leader or something but if you're a lay person
nope get too far out of line and you're gone bro
i was talking to my mom and i have been you know reconnecting a lot lately and um yeah and i was
talking to my mom the other day about like so many christians i know like straight up lie to me about
stuff like they'll like they'll they'll blatantly lie in order to like either cover themselves is usually
they'll lie about church like so she was talking about how she had a friend who said that they were
going to church that morning and then said oh church is finished early um so i'm you know we can hang out
early and mom's like no the church didn't like i know the church wouldn't have finished early and then
she like even went on their website and saw the times and then she was like asking them stuff like
you know um what was the sermon about like you know how was church like and all this stuff and the
person was just like squirming in their chair and like tronel and it's like why are you lying about
this like you know you know you're hellbound right like you know that i'm going to the same place
you are and your and your belief system like how can you why would you lie about that like right
you know sin is sin you know if i don't believe that's a sin and if you don't believe that's a sin
i'm sorry buddy like you're bearing false witness my bro it's so weird to me that they can be so
okay with lying um but sure then also trying to get you say it's it's it's strange it's like i don't
i don't get it um right yeah and i think one of the more overt lies that exists within that community
is like oh we're lgbtq friendly when i i think that is like the most heinous and frustrating
and inaccurate thing they could ever say about that community ever because at the end of the day
if someone who has like any kind of um non heterosexual identity or expression
or um desires they are going to be dragged kicking and screaming or you know at the threat
of losing all the people who quote unquote love them to some form of conversion type therapy or suppression
yeah right or or or or urged into a life of celibacy right and because that's what
jesus would want and for them to say like that's friendly that's love i just can't get on board
with that and i will be like angry about that and i yeah but like you know because my own
father my biological father is trans and so that's its own thing right and so i had to walk
like a fine line in my own theology and thinking and developing other relationship there
that there's a um i live in a relatively new suburb it's only been like around for like three
four years we moved in we built a house here in 2019 and um there's this new church that was
getting opened up in our community and like this person the pastor of this church put like a video
of him walking around the streets like talking about the love of god like you know he walk on you
know neither playground and everyone's like whoa and then he'd walk down one street and he was like
whoa like in his little video and talking about how he wants to start a church to like blah blah blah
and i commented and i said hey is your church friendly to lgbt the lgbt community and um because
he asked for questions and um and then he said oh i'll private message you me you because it's
such a touchy subject your private message me this long thing right this long like thing and it was
essentially the argument could be boiled down to um we're not going to make anyone do anything but
in some people in their faith they might find that they have to walk away from the homosexual
lifestyle but um but you know we're not going to make anyone um and i said cool and i said yeah
like i said that's all good and everything but like you know would you say the same thing for
slavery like because obviously and i referenced like dr josh you know i referenced all his work
i referenced the the bible stuff and you know and i was like bam bam like the slavery here
slavery here slavery here slavery here it was never um taken away from the new testament
you know so would you would you say to people that it's okay to own slaves and crickets and
then i'm messaging and go hey just just wondering if you've had time to to um to to look at that and
once again it was crickets again so um it's just like damn you know um it's like at what stage do
at what stage is like what stage do you call them out like publicly for this kind of stuff like
it's not normal it's um yeah i completely agree hold on so you might hear my kids in the
background like son likes to wear his hamper on his head and my daughter loves to brush her teeth
in this room so okay but yeah they're good now as a little they're um fighting mommy too
right now so yeah anyway um where were we right yeah yeah yeah what point so i think um what's
interesting in something i will say is that people uh from this community are aware some are aware
that i run a channel and some are not some are completely ignorant they're like oh that's something
you do okay all right so it's interesting to me that even people in that home group are not
or or maybe they lied to my face i don't know but it's possible um anything is possible but uh
yeah i uh i know that the rumor mill gets around and one of the things that i hope if
you know people who are from there or um i interact with you know outside of youtube and in real
life is that i'm doing that not to be anti them as a person right and i try on my i've adapted
over time on my approach to calling this stuff out from being just kind of angry and coming from a
place of hurtness to yeah we all sincerely thought this this is how we did things this is how we
organized our beliefs and organized people and you know tried to manufacture faith in them and
things like that i get all that and i care about you right but i just disagree now right i don't
think that's the best way to do things and supporting you if you must identify yourself
with an institution that goes about it this way then i guess we have an issue
but for the most part i i can easily identify that the rest of the time when you're not doing
stuff related to that community you are a well adjusted hardworking um decent parent right
that they're just trying to get by the rest of their life right and this other community
does other serves other functions for them that i don't think are entirely some of them are not
necessary some of them are and i get that i get that they need that and i don't want to necessarily
take that part away but i would prefer that some of the
harmful you know ideas the um toxic you know theology and um cultiness let's turn all that down
a little bit let's take a step back from that kind of stuff and then we'll keep talking right
um and so that's you know the primary purpose of my channel and some of its playlists and some of
my responses to things that i've done um since stepping away from the community and i will say like
for the board 18 to 25 year olds right that are especially men that don't and i think
nathan of digital notices noses also notices this with different kinds of christian communities
that there's a strong tendency for these kinds of able bodied energetic wanting to be purposeful
people get sucked into ideologies pretty easily during this age bucket right and i think it's a lot
from how we've kind of created that um find your life gully in in the west right like 18 to 25 is
like when you discover you know this is the person you're going to be this is like the direction
your life is going to take so then when you're given promises like your life can have eternal
significance your life makes the most sense in this community or in this ideological framework
and you're already primed as a youth to think of your future as this is the time where i seize my
life and i may start making something of it um you know it i think that's doing something
to us as a culture and a society especially in america that lends itself to these
um radicalized or culty kind of uh ideologies and groups uh that we're seeing rise up all the more
right yeah it's it's funny only because it's not funny um right yeah yeah i i actually i think
they do it that this community is just mastered in a way um they're uh what's the word implementation
of it right um it does a great job of insulating just enough that it can't be labeled as like a
jim jones or a jamestown type situation but enough so that emotionally right it's a oh it's like
there's a a name for this it's like bound decision making or something um in cult studies
um where like if you don't make the decision that's in favor with the group or the group ideology
then you're going to pay a lot of social cost right um and it's going to be very painful
well i actually wanted to to move on to the part in the conversation where we talk about
churches and cults and like how do we determine the difference because a lot of what you were saying
uh uh lined up with what i experienced and i you know i've had people say that i was
involved in a cult but i don't necessarily i don't know it'd be good to explore but before we
do that i just want to get everyone to make sure you go subscribe to nitty's channel um it is
it is a fun channel and you're growing growing quite quickly and you have a lot of um yeah thanks
a lot of uh like you you're mentioning how like you have you know this many subscribers and you
get like a lot of a lot of those people are watching your content which is really cool yeah yeah it's
it's a real fascinating thing to me too because well i think now my demographics are like 70 30 70%
of my views are subscribers and 30 or not and for every video i have almost as many views as i have
subscribers right so either every one of you mofos watches every day i don't know um or you know
that 30% is just gonna grow and grow and grow but uh you'll notice too so i've got interviews of
people who've left my community i've had objectively dan and michael granado on um some people
that have been very influential to me in the community pine creek dug um i love doing interviews
i love hearing from people their perspectives and exposing them to the other christians i interact
with um so that those other christians too are more aware of the other skeptics and influencers
that have a voice in my life um and the other thing i do on my channel as like a really
you know goofy thing is i try my best to do moderated open hangouts and things like that
where we talk about beliefs or non-beliefs and things like that you can definitely see the shift
in my channel of just kind of like i'm making stuff to be bitter and say some things to okay like
i i'm kind of more removed from the difficulty of the situation so now let's talk right and
this past week i had uh i did a lot of my channel i did a halloween thing where i dressed in
three different costumes over the course of the stream i was a donut donut box and then venom
uh that one was a blast um and uh i did that wednesday stream the short one uh to boost the algorithm
of what you search on youtube about that community and then i got to interview captain dad pool
he's a great guy to just hang out with his tiktok is awesome and educational and then
past your lucky was the same night so i went back to back and then um past the lucky is one of the
people i'm gonna have on but i'm trying to get a bit more yeah um yeah we've been talking but i'm
trying to get a bit more religious people on and then i had an absurdly uh long stream last night
where uh by the end of my fourth year i got a little nappy that's so good and people are like
nitty and the stream you're tired all right that's so good well everyone go check out nitty's
channel it's it's really awesome it'd be great to see your subscribers jump over this after this
and for those who answered us we're trying to get to a thousand subscribers when we get to a
thousand we're going to be doing a charity stream to raise money for an awesome charity next week
we have bitty butter coming on to talk about ritual aggnosticism so tarot cards so crystals
doing it for fun even though you don't necessarily believe it and then we have student doctor
ben coming on to talk about his journey being a trans man and of course everything that comes
along with that which will be really interesting and if you like um you want to listen to this podcast
you can listen to it on the way to work if you just search deep drinks or there's link in the
description you can you know get the uh get it on apple podcast and spotify and everything else
like that so yeah so let's jump into the culty stuff let's find out and i'm gonna as maybe you
should give a little bit of a preamble to what we're going to talk about because i'm going to pull
myself another drink yeah go for it so hit us up what do we talk what's what's a cult okay so
actually very recently on micro granados channel we talked about this and i made an effort to
i i've created in my own kind of methodology and thinking kind of four
categories of religiosity let's say right so first off you have like over on let's say like
one end of the scale the low end of the scale are just beliefs right with and some of the most
of these beliefs are probably things that are benign don't have any real impact on your lived
experience or the world things like that um they're whatever right and they're personal to you
they're unique to you and you can hold them and i don't take any particular issue with that
but you could fundamentally call that a baseline for religion right if you get enough of these
kinds of beliefs about the world that follow like certain coherence rules or
are kind of interconnected to serve their narrative or whatever like that could fundamentally
be a religion right then you have what i would call the the cultists of that of those beliefs right
so maybe some of those beliefs do have real world impact or value or direction right so
maybe i have a belief that if i rub my nipples clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time
you know i'll get a special blessing right so that the the rubbing of my nipples is i love that your hand
is actually moving on your animated character to your nipples um but yeah so that would be a
cult a cultist practice of that belief right so if i gain more followers and they say nipples be upon
you um you know then we know right that people have taken their belief up for that blessing on
and are performing that practice and ritual and adopted my language and things of thinking about
that and now i've ruined your podcast monetization but you know whatever
but yeah so um you have stuff like that right or if you pray at certain times of day right or if you
offer certain types of food or animals or sacrifices whatever it might be that's the cultists
of your beliefs right and again those things can have they can be relatively insignificant
maybe some people's cultists beliefs are pretty strange like there's actually this one
type of religion that has to carry around basically like a weapon and they like
ah sheiks yeah sheiks yeah yeah yeah and so that one to some people has significant impact
but to most others it doesn't right um and then you have what i'm sorry not did i say sheik
my god these drinks sheik is a character from zauda it's seek oh my god i knew what you were
getting at yeah yeah six which by the way um the six like they carry that sword to defend
people who need defending that's the idea about right the seek the seek temple have you heard
about the seek temple just to randomly derail um have you heard about the seek temple in
in like a big seek temple the golden temple oh so the seek temple is completely run by
volunteers i'm just trying to find out how many um they feed um oh and they feed charity feed people
they charity feed um 100 000 people a day whoa yeah and it's run completely by volunteers it's
all vegetarian because six are vegetarian and you're like damn like that's that's cool that's
like religiosity i can get behind um yeah it's what even jesus will get behind right feeding the
poor and what yeah i just think that's anyway um anyway back to you yeah so you've got just religious
beliefs the cult is of those beliefs then you've got your cult ish stuff right this this is where
your beliefs and your practices are so intertwined and fundamental to your lid experience that they
take significant amounts of time effort or social costs right where uh you are asking other people
to participate in your type of ritual or your type of way of speaking um you introduce um
you know frameworks for understanding you know your lived experience through your beliefs
um and you can even see like the cult ish happening in like fitness type groups right like
being a gym bro right have you you know skipped leg day right like we all know what that's like
referring to and the consequences and like the humiliation aspects that are all
you know intertwined with that but then think of that in terms of christianity well
are you deep in your word right that's where it's cult ish right if because if you're not
engaged in the cultists of being deep in your bible whatever that means then the cult ishness
of your social group will make you pay a price for that right or they'll just say oh man that's too bad
you know or like man i was deep in my word and right they'll extol it as like a valued
behavior or practice um and then i would then have that fourth and final bucket of a cult ish
where you do see a central leader or organizer right that's infallible and they're
like the source of truth right or i i would even go so far as to say that you could have it
happening in it as like a deputized organization level right that the founders of the organization
were so good at maintaining their systems of control their frameworks their social
punishments and their influence and maybe like the reward like the internal rewards for
staying in the group they're so good at it that it itself perpetuates after that right it's
like a self replicating culty machine and so that's where i would put like i'd have that
four bucket spectrum right and you can end up anywhere kind of on that spectrum depending on
how committed you are to your you know base level beliefs how engaged you are in the cultist of
those beliefs how um how much interaction the cultist of those beliefs plays on your life
and then does that rise to the level of you know completely excluding or removing people from your life
or um condemning them to eternal you know damnation if they don't go through all three
tears with you right then you might be in a cult so this is this might be offensive and i i hope it's
not but would you hope it's witness to be a cult then i think so yeah and because they like they
like defa they defilership like people and uh oh totally yeah yeah and loyde evans is uh content and
channel was actually pretty uh was like one chip in the deconversion process for me too
because the parodies of like jehovah's witness kinds of teachings and ways of talking about like
we have the truth we know what's up um this is the correct way to see reality i could see those
parodies in the way that i talk and the way that i framed reality and the way that i understood
things coming from the bible um would would monism be a cult then or some sex of monism
i would definitely give them a highly cultish to certain sex being cultic or being cults rather
so like um yeah i feel like what's needed is we need to continue this conversation another time
okay i need to come onto your channel and we need to have a tier list of like cult like we need to
like create like a diting and we'll just stick to certain churches and religious groups on this
yeah totally agree yeah and and there's times where i think that even like a community like the
one i left that maybe particular home groups slide themselves down that scale yeah right and
others slide themselves up that scale but it's a function of who leads those groups who does the
teaching how much power they attempt to wield how much influence they try to garner over people's
life decisions and their relationships or their you know sexual expression all that stuff right
it's also it's also gets really complicated too because like you know well well hang on there's
something important i want to say really quick yeah sorry to interrupt you but um it's that's where
i think they're first they're frustrated and the greater community around them are frustrated
is that they look at cult is this black and white kind of very defined idea right and they
sleep at night by saying we're not that right we're not that bad right and what i'm trying to
that at all right yeah yeah where i'm trying to do is you know shake them be like no like
i'm not saying you're that bad either but okay there are times right there are sectors of this
community that because of what you believe in how you believe it and how you enact it
that slide people up that scale right that that that get you into the dangerous zone and i'm trying
to let's let's let's dial that back let's dial that back a little bit yeah that so what i was
going to say is it's hard the the the definition of like cult becomes a little bit hard because
you have things like islam and islam has like some really really really big consequences for
leaving islam like it's in like eight countries eight countries apostasy can be is a death sentence
right now not necessarily like i think they might give they might like if you leave islam in some
of those countries it might just be like you know torture and a year of imprisonment if you choose to
go back on your decision to leave islam and become a muslim again but if you choose to remain
not a muslim you will be put to death um yep so but the thing is like that's a that's become
like a criminal um like governmental action not necessarily a group of people so it's like it's like
it's like is that is that we could could islam be considered a cult in those in that situation or is it
just that the cult's been become or is it just that that religion's become so influential that
now the government is essentially run um as the religion like i don't know like well in america
there are people that want it to be that way right that a theocracy yeah they want this to become
a christian nature so a nature nation so they they you know they view this as like their
fundamental you know right and purpose to recreate this country and whatever their understanding
of jesus's image would be and um i think that is in in essence just a cult with more with more power
more resources right it's a and it might be the minority even but like because they have access
to the guns and the money like you know it screws over everyone else because that's who
that's who won the struggle i guess one thing that i think a lot of um right wing um conservative christians
um fail to that they they they would hate for me to say this but it's true and that is they
have more in common with a fundamentalist muslim than they do with um say like a liberal green
feminist like like like uh because like you know they want women to cover up they think men
should be the head of the household they're like there's so many things that they like they're
like on par with um and but but then the same group of people who are totally terrified of
islam uh and you know having islam you know muslim comes to america is that you play back like a
um a heteronormative like pastor and then have like that on one half of your screen and then you have
like andretate basically expressing the same idea there is an amazing video and then you end it with
bro you're almost andretate yeah there's there's actually an amazing video i don't know who did it but
they um they they got a bible and they put it in the cover of like a quran and it went around and asked
people um what they thought of um these quran verses and they're all like this is disgusting
and they were like oh it's actually the bible and then like so many people like people stormed off
people got real angry like people were shocked it was so it was pretty funny and that's um it flashes
back to the first video you're gonna read some dissonance though yeah it's i i the first video
i ever did was um i read through the quran i got a muslim friend and i was like i want to learn
about the quran and i read through it and i was like this is a lot of this is very beautiful a lot of
it's disgusting so is the bible but so i was like i wonder if people could even tell a difference so
i created this quiz and i um this like google quiz and i put it on facebook and it was like is this
a quran verse or is this a bible verse and like i changed some of the terminology so i like
changed like the word i'll ask god or i change new things and most people got right in the middle
like a 50 50 um and most muslims got like 80 to 90 percent like they got really good and um christian
youth pastors stuff got like 15 to i got like um 75 percent um but most other people were just
right in the middle i had no idea which one was the inspired perfect word of god and which one was
um you know this born of satan evil corrupted you know so it's just it's just amazing yeah i was
like well it doesn't make you think that you can't tell the difference between the voice of god
like the inspired perfect word of god and something you consider so evil so yeah it's an interesting
thing oh hell yeah yeah i mean i and that kind of uh gradient scale to go back to the the cultiness
right uh i think is a product of spending you know this last year and a half or so on my youtube
journey out of christian d right and trying to separate out like because i see it even happening
in different like comment and chat sections on youtube is that the way certain people talk about
their person that they follow their ideas that they champion it's all a lot of it has the same
kind of uh allure and mysteria and like um what's what i'm looking for kind of um uniqueness
right and reaching of identifying with this group right that is basically like forming their own
little like pocket youtube cults um and you know you see it on i and i'm a firm believer
that i think every christian needs to go like comment and subscribe to many christians that
they disagree with and see how long they can endure listening to their like affirmations of how
they view the bible is just completely true and then try and hold on to their own right like
troi black kane ash cat ker all of that like go invest yourself in that and try and say that now
when you go read the bible you are really hearing from god i dare you yeah yeah one thing i learned
in my deconstruction though was um most people don't care like they don't care about their beliefs
they don't care if they're true they don't care if like it's only when and i don't know if i would
have even cared either i i think the only reason i started caring was because i was hurt by the church
and i also had a deep fascination with science if i didn't have something to jump to like if i
didn't have something that was like in conflict with um my religious um ideas like like science
that that caused me to want to you know you know fix that issue like cross like cross the teas and
dot the eyes then i want then i wonder if i would have ever like i wonder if i'd still be a christian
now um because i mean it's the opposite i care too much oh really yeah yeah because like i said i
pursued being a leader and stuff right and like you know i can still do like my daniel nine
prophecy teaching right like i i you know heavily invested myself in the apologetics channels
before i started stepping away from that and looking at what skeptics on youtube are saying
what do you think mate because because because when i when i say that i think that i wonder if i'd
care is i'm talking about like more like really fundamentally like why did i because i noticed
that a lot of people they have like beliefs but they they they call them like sticky i call them
like sticky beliefs so therefore if like so if if someone's like um oh i'm a liberal right then when
someone asks them well how do you feel about abortion they like scan their brain what does
liberal think about abortion and then they just say oh yeah they slot in so uh so when someone's
like is is a christian you know you can even ask some like devout christians like oh do you ever
have doubts like yeah i have doubts and stuff like but so i like i wonder though if i ever would
have got so really serious about my underlying epistemology uh like how i know what i know do you
like do you know why maybe you cared about what you what you believe was true like do you know
why maybe you thought that like you felt that sorry yeah yeah so um well the you want to know
something really ironic is that the community that i was a part of actually has idiomatic and
like paradigmatic ways of working with things especially in the bible that are exactly that
right that the community will say to the faces of the people around them we care about truth
don't follow jesus because it feels good but because it's true yeah right like the facts of the
matter of your salvation don't care about the feelings of your doubts right we would say shit
like this right and so i'm inculcated and indoctrinated to care about truth to a level
that's like absurd right i remember teaching first printhians 15 and being like look the apostle
paul says if this isn't true fuck off and go home like don't don't do any of this stuff right oh
you'll have to believe that but i didn't say it no no no exactly i said you know like you should just
all go home and you know do whatever else right like because this wouldn't fundamentally
matter right uh we're most of all to be pitied if we're gonna sit in the circle and talk about
this stuff right so we we would position ourselves right or i was involved in a community that
would position itself as these arbiters of truth right and to have resources and people
engaged enough with the things that i would argue like paul agia and prophet azad and things like that
um engage enough with what i said and understanding the whole picture of where that's coming from and coming to a
different conclusion was really important to me and i was like able to step away and be like now wait a
minute i'm i think like this right and there's still christians or people that say they're christian and
fundamentally disagree with me and then there's the atheists and skeptics over here that say they care
about truth too but they don't believe any of this right why is that and yeah and then i also kind of
saw the failure of one of like a core apologetics for christianity that we used in our community was
it's too early to be legend right like that the reporting of these events is too close to the events to just be a
fabrication when yeah let's talk about in 2020 uh i don't know if you know this but a lot of half my country
thinks that someone else won an election that i don't think they won right so if time span is our indicator
of truth then if people can become convinced of an entirely different reality in two months with more fact
checking and more like i witnessed testimony so the country 4k 4k video yeah and like
the like unlimited and unlimited amount of information at their fingertips versus like you know
illiterate um you know first century palestine with like the way like what is it like 95% of people
couldn't even read and write like they yeah you would show them a card trick and they would think
you were like some sort of a deity like it's right if we put david blaine in a tARDIS and brought
him there i mean we would be blaming it blaney annity right like it's asked what it got crucified
and we'd be worshiping david blaine but no like yeah you're totally right and so the credulity
uh when you not to say that ancient people were dumb like i don't think no they weren't people
2000 years ago were dumb however they just did not have the resources and the cultural
credulity that we have now right that to go back and say no wait a minute that sounds really
fucky like i don't think that really happened right like no like they're god narratives they're
religious structures primed them for accepting claims like these and that was normal you know yeah
and so i saw the failures of one of my prime apologetics right before my eyes right and i'm
like well now if we can doubt something like this in this short of time span why do i hold so
firmly to this right and so i went on this investigation of like the exodus and found
that super lacking and i'm like okay okay maybe it's better for jesus and then i found the truth out
about um you know what is the real condition of our manuscript evidence for the new testament
right it's these credit card size snippets up until about the year 300 or so yeah and the early
church fathers one of the things that i noticed reading them myself is they'll say like oh the
early church fathers they quote scripture well the references to particular passages are inserted
later by apologists right to create really yeah so to create the correlation of the gospel of
matthew to something that like let's say um you know vizantinius i'm making a name of but um or origin
or some some other dude like that right right that that one to one correlation of an idea a biblical
idea in the gospels or an epistle being in reference quote for the most part none of the
church fathers say as stated by matthew as stated by mark as stated by john you know we learned
that blah blah blah no they just said as our lord said or or as it is written right it's just a
big general thing that they had from their particular writing tradition right so this one to one
correlation that's happening of church fathers to gospels is mostly a construction of later
apologists going in and saying okay yeah that matches up with what we attribute to matthew so
let's put that reference there yeah i i remember i'm excuse me for doing some bawa reading
but um in uh john i remember sitting in a lunch room reading my bible and i had there was a
christ an ex christian came in and i was in the lunch room at willworth's uh was supermarket in australia
i was reading and i was reading the bible and he said and he i remember this spot me out he goes um
turn to john seven uh 38 i'll read from 37 on the last uh and the last and the greatest day of the
festival jesus stood and said in a loud voice let anyone who is thirsty come um come to me and drink
and then verse 38 whoever believes in me as the scripture has said rivers of living water will
flow from within them and he's like there's that's nowhere in scripture he's like that's nowhere in
the old testament he's like he's quoting something that's not in the bible and also oh yeah oh what there
is that yet he's like look it up and i'm like oh oh i was like but this is perfect like this is the
perfect word of god like yeah or or matthew says that he will be called a nazarene right
that's nowhere in any protestant or catholic um traditions right but
around that time period of the writing of matthew there arose a cult that um worshiped
john the baptist as the messiah and that brought um yeah they're called the nazarenes uh or the uh
oh shoot the mandians um there those names are kind of interchangeable so maybe at that time
period there was a writing that said the messiah will be called a nazarene right and that gives complete
credence to why the gospel of john keeps john the baptist right but he's just the forerunner
right yeah that it's an acknowledgement that yes we understand that you think john the baptist is the
best but hang on my friends jesus is even better right or how and in addition to that right and
matthew and mark also include john the baptist um to a significant extent and that's again
why they did it too right they include john to basically be in in my mind rather i'm not a scholar
but uh i'm gonna pull a dr josh i'm not a scholar but in my mind that's their polemical effort
to say now no now the christ is the right tradition right yeah not not the john the baptist
through your your nazarene guys you know you're you're just a step underneath us yeah it's funny too
because um you think about how much has like changed in because the bible was canonized in like
360 or 315 ad yeah i learned this i learned that in bible in ministry college and i was like whoa
but the life expectancy for someone in first century palestine i just looked it up one source says
um 35 years one source says 29 years one source says um 48 years so either way it was it was younger
if you go off what what these people are saying online well you you know though that i think some
of those numbers you have to find the one that um discounts infant mortality as part of that average
oh yeah so like well that's probably why we get 48 versus right like 35 because that's a big gap
yeah that's what i was thinking so like because you obviously there'd be a whole bunch of arguments
but so you've got like you know the gospels were written almost a lifetime after the fact you got 30 years
40 years and it's 55 years or something right um jesus died roughly 33 35 CE between 30 and 33 CE
and then his um the first writings were mark in um was it 70 CE it was a yeah they project like uh
even the most conservative scholars from what i understand it's like between like 60 late early 60s till
early 70s yeah and then we don't actually have full copies until like i think our first full
copy of mark wasn't until like 250 CE like many years later but doesn't mean that but the originals
were still back then but what's interesting is like and in barter emin talks about this in his book
lost christianity there christianity was never a monolith of of ideas like there there was like the
gnostic christians there was what sorry what we refer to today as the gnostic christians and the
marcianites and the ebionites and like the marcianites they rejected the whole old testament they said the
old testament is an evil deity jesus came to save us from this evil deity and you're like damn the
ebionites were like no paul is batshit crazy you gotta follow the old testament you gotta be a vegetarian
you gotta like then you have like the gnostics who were like jesus was a phantasm he was like a ghost
he was never really spirit he was never really here in physical and then you have like the proto
orthodox which eventually is what uh constantine um accepted as his form of christianity and then it
just stamped out that that becoming in the head of religion in rome like stamped out all the others
but it's like damn like what have we lost in that 300 years like oh my gosh yeah it's it's just
well if you read mind if you read uh some of the other church fathers before the nicy and creed one of the
things that i learned was that there seems to be a very different view of the atonement than how we
portray it in modern christendom so like uh how i would have explained like jesus's atonement on the cross
is a once and final finite infinite punishment dished out in a finite amount of time right but back
then uh it seems to me from reading the translated works of these early church fathers before
the nicy and creed is that they viewed the atonement as something that happened is happening and is ever
continuing so they had this like a temporal view of their christ figure always like performing the
miracle of saving or bringing people to saving faith or redemption it's just so weird like we don't think
of things generally in that kind of framework right especially something as cosmic as the and in a way
like if you kind of like go back on like if i went back on my christian faith and was like
oh yeah like maybe every time someone gets saved it's like jesus gets sacrificed again which is also
like a really weird kind of fucked up thought but like but like they wouldn't do that they wouldn't
like put you know that person in the jesus tartis and throw them back 2000 years ago for him to
get recrucified like no that's not how they thought of it they thought of it it's like it's this ever
happening thing right it's it's almost like um going to like a perpetual like water fountain
right at uh like the mall or something it's like an outdoor water fountain just it's even if you're
next to it or not next to it right it's still pumping the water through the fountain right it's always
going on or like oh oh or like the planets right going around the sun like that's just something
that for all of our existence has always been happening whether we acknowledge it or not and
that seems to be how they kind of viewed the atonement and i was just like reading this like
what the hell man like this is so interesting why wasn't i told this stuff as a christian
yeah that's um there's there's so much like really interesting stuff hey when you like dig
into it and i found reading the bible is so much more interesting now that i don't have to protect
my beliefs right yeah it's it's become super interesting like on my channel for halloween uh
the intro to my stream was what are some terrible biblical costumes that you could have
like and i thought of going is like a uh pile of 200 flesh flaps and then people be like what the
hell are you and i'm like oh i'm just i'm just the dowry for a wife it's cool
oh there's this um i i i wish i had the same idea but when i didn't but there is an amazing book
that is just so good hang on let me just let me just load it and it's a little not it's a little
not safe for work um that it's it's i think it's okay so it's a it's a it's a children's book um
but uh written like it's a children's book with children's like cartoons but it's like retells
the bible stories so and just this this image was just amazing the king of the foreskins
and it's like for this daughter's hand in marriage the king still wanted no less than 100 phyllis
son foreskins david really wanted to become the son in law of a powerful king took his men and killed
enough phyllis dines to bring back 200 foreskins david counted them all in front of the king as promise
he was a water the princess i just love and the king's like oh my god like thank you so much
like it's just amazing like oh my god you can't make it up um which reminds me i've got to get
it i've got to get that for our child it's coming along in uh january 20 what's the title of this book
so that i may purchase it um i have to find out um send it to me in the private if you yeah okay
yeah i i don't actually know but but um i just googled um i'd like google to get this just then
cartoon bible book foreskins so just google that and then you'll probably find it um that's on
some list yeah probably yeah but um nitty i want to end um the podcast there but um and just
move over to some q and q and a um i have a couple of questions if anyone has any questions for nitty
make sure you um comment them but i've got a couple that i ask all the guests so i'll start off
with them and if anyone got any other questions we'll um we'll answer them as well but um i know
we were going to talk about purity culture but i think we're going to save for another time but um
sure yeah um you can come over to my channel and do that yeah let's do that i got lots of stories
about that um so what if anything would change your mind
ooh yeah that's an important one um well uh i think that when i talk so i also do work
in public with a sign at a coffee shop that says it's best to be an atheist in 2022 let's talk
and strangers come up to me and we have like honest conversations about what we believe by
we believe it sort of that and you put that online no i don't no no wow that's cool yeah i just
do it to do it so um i have the miracle the flying phone it's my wet wet napkin kind of thing
so i say like if i pray right now in the name of g i hold up my cell phone and say if i pray right
now in the name of jesus who died for our sins according to the scriptures right that this phone
would float to prove the truth of his sacrifice and it floats we're done right it's over like i'm gonna
not strain my credulity or my mind or my lived experience and just say yep like i am not an
experienced magician or like you know sleight of handist or anything like that if that thing floats
i'm done like i believe okay like sign me back up i'm gonna start performing my miracle the floating
phone everywhere right um but that's one thing another thing that would be just an answer to one of my prayers
when i was in the deconversion process which was i prayed that because i saw the epistemological gap
in the reporting of the gospels to uh their alleged events i prayed to receive a
a manuscript a more complete manuscript closer to the events not even like
that it could be dated to like the day of the crucifixion right i just asked god for something
lesser than that right like just anything to assuage my doubt that like this was like a later creation
or invention right and going through the unansweredness of that prayer was pretty brutal
but if that got answered right i would be like okay like what does this thing say like
let's get into it let's ham through that text like i'll stand by that prayer even though i offered it
you know two years ago at this point well it's that's actually really interesting that you say that i i've often
thought about like how prayers are answered and when people like pray and they get like a sign from god
whether it's like a number or they get like you know they feel they they open their bible and the
scripture really speaks to them and it's god telling them they love them or anything the information
that god always seems to give to people seems to be something that they could find out themselves
or it's like a coincidence or it's like it's like something that humanity already knows about right
even if it's something like crazy like i need my wife to tell me it's okay things are going to get better
you know where you know or something and then it happens like even something like that is
it's not really new information i'm like why doesn't god say hey um you know and i've asked i've
asked apologists this who say that god talks to them all the time i say hey we'll ask them what gene
do you want us to look at that would solve cancer that would fix cancer for everybody oh yeah yeah
and a lot of the time well actually times that i've actually asked this um they say well there is a
cure to cancer and then they you know of course they believe that there's a sort of cure to cancer
with like apricot seed garlic rubbing on garlic on your ankles or hopping skipping hopping four
so they of course they believe that stuff but i might i might know i mean like a gene that we could
you know we could get some sort of a vaccine for cancer like yeah literally of course usually the other
anti-vaxxers as well but the point is like why doesn't god give us new information information
that's like further even if you don't even if you're not a scientist hey go tell the scientists to
look at this one thing just go do just tell them to look at this one gene or this one thing it will
solve it like yeah apology is thing it would be like if he was revealed some kind of mathematical
proof right because he has zero background in like mathematics or something i think it's him who said
that or like camille greger who studies like ancient manuscripts and things like that he's like
if we found like a gospel fragment in south africa or sorry in south america right that we could
date to around that time period and there's like no sensical way that that text could end up over
there right it's like underneath some fucking mayan temple right and they unearth this thing and like
holy shit you know it's got a depiction of the christ and john the bass isn't here and whoa oh my god
but even then it's like why would you have to find that like what if god wants to know us why can't
yeah someone asked a question though um seeking asked if you were in a life threatening situation
would you pray just curious probably i'll still put that in like a probably right now because like
i mean who doesn't right like i'll i'll be that guest who you know frustrates your hard line
atheist and stuff it's like oh can't you be the atheist in the foxhole can't you be strong enough
it's like well maybe i don't know yeah and i'm actually a firm believer that you don't really
know who you'll be tomorrow like there there's like a set of circumstances or life events that
can fundamentally offer alter your psychology to the point where you'll act in ways that you never
personally expected that you might act and so i'm willing to be completely agnostic as to how
i would respond to a life threatening situation uh maybe i would pray maybe i would just be like oh god
i'm finally getting off the right but yeah i don't know who knows and the other reason i think that
way is from freaking darin brown and like the kind of stuff that he does with people but there's uh
i've got a bit of a story time just to say that that's just because it's so super relevant to
to what we're talking about um so i used to go spearfishing right and this is point art right
where i used to live so i used to live like down here in the amount coulomb um so point art right
um it looks small here right but what you would do is can you see that fun
yeah right yeah yeah so what you do is like this is a big cliff and stuff and i'd walk along
these rocks and stuff and you get to i think it was i think you'd get in the water about here
um i think it was here uh yeah it was it's it's here so it was like shallow right you get in
you put your flippers on you put your fins on i'll get my spear gun stuff but this time this one
time i came and it was the biggest swell that would ever had but i wasn't wearing my glasses
when i rocked up so i just kind of saw white and i was like whatever it's not that big of a deal
and i put on my um gear and i was getting in the water and i kicked out to this section here
and i ended up in in front of here like without my um like without any option to get out so
essentially there were like waves that were like you know a couple meters high coming in this way
this way this way and i was like in a washing machine just getting push oh rip current yeah yeah
oh no it was worse than a rip current if a rip current just pulls you out but this was like
this was like one wave coming in here one wave coming in here one wave coming in here and i was
just like like floating like bouncing around like this so i was drowning i couldn't i couldn't
get out like and i couldn't kick hard enough with my fins to stay above the water uh and i realized
i like i i said i thought to myself like a analyze the situation what's like what's
happening right now i was screaming for help there were people watching but they couldn't do
anything and um and i said what am i going to do and i calculated i was like there's probably a 50
percent chance i'm gonna like there's over a 50 percent chance i'm gonna die now like in this
situation and um and i decided that what i would do uh and i thought okay i'm going to pray right
so i thought to myself like i'll i'll pray to god uh and and i was deconstructing at the time
and i said i'll pray to god and um and you know say that i'll commit my life back to him and i'll
live for righteous life and all this stuff like you know i guess pleading i was panicked and then
it was at that moment that i realized i didn't believe in god and that at that moment i realized
that i was like alone in my situation and i realized i was probably gonna die and i realized
like oh like fuck and that that realization of like i don't believe i probably don't i don't believe
in god like i'm not convinced of the existence of god like even if i did pray i didn't think it would
matter and then secondly that i'm probably gonna die was terrifying so what i ended up doing actually
is um the only way i could get out of this was swim into the rocks because that was the only way
that i could get out and so i swam into the rocks and i got absolutely minced up and threw off my you know
$200 fins and like stumbled across rocks i fell back in the water over here um and i like
i got out of the main part of the swell though but i was just cut up bleeding everywhere and um
wow i don't i don't know if i bashed my head but when i went to i got taken to the hospital and
when i got home um i i come home my wife didn't answer her phone and i i drive the car up i'm covered
in blood i'm like you never answer your phone and she's like oh my god she runs down she gets oh my god
she tries to in the whole hell i'm like you never answer your phone why do you never answer your phone
i was dying but yeah it happened so as i quickly but it was crazy to to be like to like i've had that
experience where i was in real danger and i was like okay time to pray and then the realization of
uh oh like i don't know if i believe it like it's not like it was a choice right right but at the
same time i don't know like if i'm being a hundred percent honest like maybe that was like some like
pride i didn't know about or ego or something but i don't know but like all i know is that's how i how i um
yeah how i went through it um sorry to to no no that was great but well i mean sorry you went through
that but i'm glad yeah i was actually i was actually on a diet um trying to lose some weight
and exercising that's why i was surfing and on the way back from the hospital i said to i'm aiming i was
like well let's go to mcdonald's i've got like a big double quarter pounder i was like eating my
feelings and i didn't go to work for three days i just took valium and just lay there like eat your
names yeah so last question um what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in
uh i mean
um no not um i think
some form of like unfalsifiable theism is what i could like get on board with
like i don't think that that's true like like some prime mover yeah like those base arguments
for god i still could like maybe grant some of that or some of those maybe so like a
so like a weak form of deism or something right right yeah yeah yeah but that's not it's not a great
answer to your question though because you know like i guess like some form of like
like
a dirty word here but like maybe like some kind of a marcianite type of christianity maybe
right like that i that like the christ narrative and philosophy of an all loving god that wants to
restore relationship to its creation which is demonstrably like you know difficult for its
created beings if all that's true um but i think if we remove the belief that that god requires
