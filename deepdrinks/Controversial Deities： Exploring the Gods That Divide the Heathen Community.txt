So, whether or not a Yotun is a deity is something that some heathens will argue about from time to time.
Personally, I think that they fall under a polytheist definition of gods, so it's fine to call them gods, in my opinion, in fact, do.
There are some that want to modify the definition a little bit and engage in different presuppositions, and that's fine, whatever.
But an example of a deity that is particularly controversial would be Hel, who is the goddess of death.
And then there is also Yoramangandar, who is the world serpent.
Fender, who is represented in myth as a giant wolf.
And there is also the father of all three of these, Loki, who is particularly controversial in modern heathen worship.
