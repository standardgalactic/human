But if we look at life around us, we don't see fine tuning.
The best, most finely tuned pieces of engineering are distilled down to the simplest forms of
what is being engineered.
We don't see that.
We see complexity, and we see wildly unnecessary complexity, whether it's junk DNA and RNA.
You see the fact that 99.9% of all life on this planet has gone extinct.
You see this planet where, what, it's 97% water, or 70% water, and we can't, you know,
it's unlivable to humans, 90 plus percent of the water is undrinkable.
Our sun gives us cancer.
We see vestigial bones in animals that don't need them, heavy bones in flying animals,
things on flightless birds, eyes on fish.
