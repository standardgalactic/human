At first, only gays and IV drug users were being killed by AIDS.
But now we know every one of us could be devastated by it.
The fact is, over 50,000 men, women and children now carry the AIDS virus.
But in three years, nearly 2,000 of us will be dead.
But if not stopped, it could kill more Australians than World War II.
Yeah, they're infamous.
They used to terrify people, even though I suppose I think they did sort of say
that it was more prevalent in the gay society with gay men,
but it was taking out people left, right and centre.
So there was a real fear around it.
