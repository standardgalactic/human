And it has stuff in it, like a guy who has a dinner party
and he hears a cockroach and he thinks that this means
that he's going to be sentenced to death.
So he thinks he's going to die.
And so he tells everybody at this dinner party,
his friends, that they need to divide his body
amongst themselves and eat it after his death.
You need to commemorate him.
There's another scene called the widow of Ephesus
where this widow is in a tomb
because her husband has died and she's mourning
and there are three crucified men outside
and a Roman soldier guarding them and he hears her weeping
and he goes in and like one thing leads to another
and they kind of start a little relationship in the tomb
for three days and three nights.
And then when the Roman soldier leaves the tomb
after he's sort of wooed the widow,
he realizes that somebody's come and taken the body down
of one of their family.
