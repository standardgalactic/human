We were able to decipher the cuneiform of Akkadian, of Sumerian, and this gave us a bit of a literary linguistic context for a lot of these discussions, and people noticed there were parallels between what was being said in a lot of these texts and what was being said in the Bible.
And then in 1927, we discovered what are referred to as the Eugiridic texts. This was not over in Mesopotamia, but just north of Israel in Syria.
There was this city discovered right near the coast with about 1000 tablets written in cuneiform, but it was in an alphabetic script. There were only, I think, about 30 different characters rather than hundreds of different characters.
And so they thought, oh, this is probably alphabetic, not syllabic, not ideographic, not anything like that. And we were able to decipher this language called Eugiridic, which is very, very closely related to very early Hebrew.
