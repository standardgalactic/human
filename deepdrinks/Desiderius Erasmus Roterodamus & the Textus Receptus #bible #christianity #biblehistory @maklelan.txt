And one of the things that catalyzed the Reformation was the sudden availability of a Greek edition
of the New Testament that was produced by a Dutch humanist scholar named Desiderius Erasmus,
who was producing his own edition of the Vulgar. Erasmus went to his library in Switzerland,
said, give me all the New Testament manuscripts you got, which amounted to seven. The earliest one
was from the 12th century seat. And he cobbled together an edition of the Greek New Testament
and published that. We now refer to this as the Textus Receptus, which means the received text.
And the second edition of his Textus Receptus is what Martin Luther used to produce his
translation into German of the New Testament.
