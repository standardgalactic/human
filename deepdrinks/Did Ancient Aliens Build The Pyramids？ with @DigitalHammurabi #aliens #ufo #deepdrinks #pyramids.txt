So the pyramids weren't built by aliens? Is that what you're trying to say?
They were not. Where it originally came from was racism.
Really?
Yes, absolutely. And there are many people who have dedicated their careers to explaining this.
And at its core, ancient alien theory was created to explain why black and brown people
built monuments that white people didn't. There are very few ancient alien theories about Stonehenge.
The ziggurats, the pyramids, the monuments in South America. All aliens, definitely.
I want to be very clear. I am not saying that people who enjoy ancient alien theories are
necessarily racists. The TV producers are very clever. They can manufacture loose ends that
don't actually exist if you look at the archaeology. And then the ancient alien theorists can come in
and kind of tie it all up with a nice, neat bow.
