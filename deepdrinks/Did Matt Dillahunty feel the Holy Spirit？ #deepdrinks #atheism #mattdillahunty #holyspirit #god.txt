I felt what at the time I would have described as the Holy Spirit.
And then later I learned that similar, not identical, similar feelings can be achieved
through listening to secular music, looking at secular art, taking drugs, having sex,
eating really good meals, all of these things that give us dopamine hits in our brain.
If you're a 12 or 13 year old and you're like, what's this feeling?
And you don't know anything about the way music impacts people, the way rhythmic speech
impacts people, the way how wonderful it is, even if it's not true, to believe that you are
special in the eyes of some creator, that there's somebody out there who knows the answers you
don't know and has got your back and has a plan for your life.
