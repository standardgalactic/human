Huntie fighting Jordan Peterson was one of the most significant
of Jordan Peterson's career where people went oh shit this guy who I was listening to and going
like he's got good points I just watched him use the same reasoning on atheism which I know why
it was stupid and I'm starting to apply that to some of the other shit he says fuck I was wrong
about this guy
