In the fiction regard, I would do James Joyce and don't go big like with Ulysses, but do
a portrait of the artist as a young man.
It is a coming-of-age story of a Catholic schoolboy that wrestles with his faith and
his call into the priesthood because the art is calling him.
And it's at odds with deep religious belief, and there's a huge chapter on hell, which
is phenomenal, and it's fiction.
It's probably Joyce's best work in my opinion, but yeah, I would do that one.
