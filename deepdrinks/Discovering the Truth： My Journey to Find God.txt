But what's funny is at the end, they were saying that they'll pray for me and I'll know that God is real because like of the experience that I'm going to have.
And I said, awesome.
Like, I was like, great.
And I actually said, I'm going to put this in my calendar.
I said, how long do you need for this miracle to happen?
Because she said soon, I said, how long do you need this miracle to happen that will convince me?
Because if it does convince me, great.
Like, if there is a God, I want to know about it.
I put it in my calendar for a year's time.
I said, sure, I'll get a year, a year for this miracle for this thing to happen.
It's going to happen soon to a year's way more than like it needs to be.
And I went to, and then I got this like thing, message that person and tell them if the prayer worked like a year later.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm blocked.
Like, I got blocked like so.
