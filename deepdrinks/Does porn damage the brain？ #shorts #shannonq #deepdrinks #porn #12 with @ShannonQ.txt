Did you know that porn damages your brain?
God damn it.
It does not damage the brain.
People who watch a lot of porn
have a slightly overactive ventral stratum,
so it lights up a bit more in an MRI.
So it's not growing or changing.
It's still exactly the same fucking size
that as it always was, just more neurons are firing.
That's literally all that fucking says
and that your reward center might be slightly overreactive,
but many different things could lead to that.
Porn can be a maladaptive coping strategy
because it's dopamine inducing, right?
It can become a maladaptive habit.
So it can be something that becomes habit forming
that you do repetitively as a form of fading,
depressive or anxiolytic thoughts,
gambling or shopping or video games.
Like the same pathways are activated
for the same reasons to get the same result
that can form the same type of maladaptive habits
for the same reasons with those activities as well.
