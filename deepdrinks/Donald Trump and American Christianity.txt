But if you think about Donald Trump, in terms of American Christianity,
and you think about the teachings of Jesus, what are the teachings in the
Bible that we might be able to call admirable?
Be humble, that's not Trump.
Don't love money, that's not Trump.
Be faithful to your spouse, that's not Trump.
Don't lust, that's not Trump.
Don't take vengeance because vengeance is God's, that's not Trump.
Don't bear false witness or lie or covet.
I mean, a time in it, don't be cruel, love the poor and the disadvantaged.
Trump fails on every single level, which is one of the reasons it's so maddening
to watch these Bible-banging evangelicals in my country worship.
