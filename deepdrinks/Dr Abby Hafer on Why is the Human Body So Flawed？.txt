I've had her on the show a couple of times and she's just, she's a killer.
I mean, she just, she's in and she's like, well, this, this stupid.
And this is, you know, why would God make the same canal that we use to excrete feces and urine?
Why would he use all of that stuff for our sex?
Like, why would you make the water slide and the sewer pipe the same thing?
Why in the world would you put the esophagus and the, you know, the wind pipe next to each other?
So there are hundreds and hundreds of joking deaths every single year.
You know, why would you put this?
Why would you do that?
And she's got a great point.
And then she points to other creatures in nature that actually have a better design.
You know, there are tons of animals in the animal kingdom beside the human animal to have much better
eyes than we do.
Our eyes are not great and they require constant correction by scientists.
