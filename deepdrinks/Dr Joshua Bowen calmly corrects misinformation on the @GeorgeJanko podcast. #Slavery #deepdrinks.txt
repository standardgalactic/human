You know how they say slavery is in the Bible and that slavery was okay?
How do you guys argue against that?
Exodus chapter 21 verse 16, it says very clearly,
if you kidnap someone and are caught with them in your possession
or having gotten rid of them and sold them, you must be put to...
Let's just say, for the sake of argument, it's just in the Hebrew Bible.
And the Hebrew Bible is brand new and it says,
hey, it's illegal to kidnap people and subject them to slavery.
Therefore, what?
If you ask that to Cliff, his answer is going to have to be,
I guess this makes slavery okay, right?
Because, well, I mean, you can't kidnap people and subject you,
but then the text says that you can have slaves.
Yeah, but it says that you can't kidnap them
and subject a free person to slavery.
So there is no slavery?
Like, is that the point that you're trying to make?
Because, like, the next set of verses talks about what to do with your slave.
