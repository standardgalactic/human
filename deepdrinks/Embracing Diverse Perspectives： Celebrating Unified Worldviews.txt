to address something that's kind of coming up in your chat that there are
people who are idealists who engage with science and there are people who are
physicalists who engage with science and they do so using the same information
there's like unified worldviews I don't think that there is one I think that
there's like very there's different starting points there's different lenses
in which how people are viewing the world and the diversity of that at the
end of the day is something that can be celebrated and viewed approached in a
way that is pluralistic and with tolerance or it can be viewed in a way
that is like doc sacked doc sastically strict in which we're saying no no no
there's only one acceptable way to do things right and that is one of my
fundamental problems with Christianity is that they go about things that way
