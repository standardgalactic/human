in the mid 1990s. And of course, I'd been trained to feel like gay people were going
to hell. I made fun of gay people. I was a toxic person about this thing. And he wrote
me a letter and he was just like, you don't know this about, he hit it very well. But
he said, you know, I'm gay and you need to know. And we didn't speak for about a year.
I just couldn't process it. And I realized how much I missed the guy and how he was
still a beautiful person and still my best friend. And what was I doing? And I reached
back out and we reconnected. And I think that is the first time I can really remember deciding
I'm going to cut this out of the Bible in my brain. I'm going to take these anti gay
verses, all these judgment verses. And I'm just going to say, no, I'm not going to do
that.
