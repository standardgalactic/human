Right. So how does a polytheist look at one set of gods that are alleged to have been the creators or a different particular deity that is alleged to be the creator and say, yes, I acknowledge existence of that deity and I acknowledge existence of that deity at the same time.
So how this kind of breaks down generally is that polytheists don't are not as committed to the myths in that way in the same way that, say, a Christian might be.
So a Christian would disbelieve in Odin and his brothers for creating the universe because that is something that is credited to their God.
So it's not something that is acceptable among Christians to believe.
