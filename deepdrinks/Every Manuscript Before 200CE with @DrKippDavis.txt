What you're about to see are the earliest manuscripts of the Gospels, and by the end
of this video, I'll let you make up your own assumptions about why you may never have
heard this from the pulpit.
Christian apologists have argued that the Gospels are reliable accounts of the life,
death and resurrection of Jesus.
I mean, we have thousands of manuscripts, right?
We have better documentation for Jesus than any other historical figure, right?
As you watch this video, I have a challenge for you.
Keep a thought at the back of your mind.
Imagine that you are an all-powerful and all-loving being, and that you have an important message
for humankind.
Imagine that this message is so important that everything else fails in comparison.
You have all the resources and power of an all-powerful, loving Creator.
And at the end of the video, comment if you would do anything different than the God of
the Bible.

how many results were found seven so you lied to me you said there was eight you lie you
I know I know I think some some of the there's there's some some I think some there's possibly a
a disputed second third century manuscript which which could be included in this list right so
so here's I'm I'm just going to show you what we're looking at here okay
so p52 is our very earliest new testament manuscript hooray it dates to sometime between 150
and 180 ce and this is the whole thing it's two sided right and it contains text from
john chapter eight and that's it wait so again let's let's break us down when was john written
it was 90 c uh 90 ish probably 90 90 c so so 60 70 80 years later 60 70 80 years after jesus
had died it's written no no no no 60 70 80 years after john was written oh no no no i mean sorry
i'm going back in first i'm saying jesus dies then 60 years later is 90 c e yeah yeah the
original john is written and it's writing about things that will happen six years ago
in a different language a different location on earth yeah um about things that happened
60 years ago and then the earliest copy we have is this credit card another parchment
60 70 years and this is all we have yeah this is it that's all of it so and for people who are
interested this is from john chapter 18 this is um uh jesus appearing before pilot okay so that's
p52 and by the way this manuscript is that the university of manchester hey that's that's
where you got your phd yeah man that's right so okay so that's p52 p66 is this
how big is that it's uh so what does this say here like if you if you look at the oh um if we go
back to this one you can see can you read great or isn't right or you yeah i can read great yeah
yeah so if you look here you can see the ruler here at the bottom so those are centimeters
and uh i guess if you're a philistine or an american you'll you'll how many qubits is that
inches i only measuring qubits so like that's that's about two centimeters by five centimeters
and that's uh john chapter 19 okay so there's p66 but that's so actually i have to say that's
that's uh it all it belongs to this manuscript and this is an admittedly very impressive manuscript
so this is a codex from around the year 200 and it was once an entirely intact copy of the
whole gospel of john that is without to speak so hooray year 200 we've got the whole gospel
whole gospel of john well um presumably p p 60 um oh my gosh what was the first one with the p-52
p-52 presumably p-52 would be from a whole copy of john presumably right or is it
it's not not how it worked is that a bad bad assumption i think that is a
an unfounded assumption okay yeah all right because i'm just imagining yeah because
nothing about it maybe there was certainly sections and yeah okay that makes sense right
because i have this but i have this perspective that's like they're writing the eternal words of
like i still have this christian perspective it's like these are the eternal words of god
that will live on forever like we're we're forgetting too that a lot of these um these
these christians believe that g well because jesus said it that he was going to return in
their lifetimes they didn't think they were going to die of old age they did or they got killed
whatever they they thought so there's no need to write me this down it was something until what three
70 or 360 or something where we actually canonize this like sometime in their third century or
fourth century sorry we canonized um the bible fourth century yeah yeah it's like geez
he's uh taking his time coming back what is it a day it's like a thousand years of thousands
years like a day oh that works out for us uh so it's been oh god so it's been two days um
so you know lucky you know but it's funny because jesus did actually say explicitly
like he's like he's like i can't be in clear people standing here today will not taste death
until they see the sun man coming on the clouds and like he can't be any more clear but somehow
he's being symbolic there or or or they won't taste the second death as in like well you know who
knows i mean that's um yes you know that's a huge problem so anyway so this is p77 p77 now
you'll notice uh these fragments these survive from codices which are books so they have writing
on the front and the back um you know i i work with the dead sea scrolls which are scrolls and you
only write on one side of the scroll and you know when you have writing on two sides that's how you
know it's codex so um but this is what you have this is p77 and it preserves text from matthew
23 just matthew 23 uh so i thought you were gonna say matthew 23 matthew 23 i i actually thought
i was going to say more than that too so that's that's that's that's all we have all right so
p77 uh oh god i shouldn't click that button sorry i have to do this over again so second century
and it's easy because you know this is all we have from the second century and we're just doing
gospels all right so that was p77 here is p90 it's a little bit bigger right a little bigger
and it comes from a codex so it's two-sided uh it looks like um artwork from the early 2000s
that would be on like a t-shirt if it was like oh i would i would wear that if it was on a t-shirt
yeah damn right so john 18 to 19 thereabouts that's what's text from we have preserved uh
or hang on on this particular manuscript hang on yeah yeah uh we actually have uh we have someone
who's actually solved it all for us um nitty oh good trust me brah yeah man trust me is legit
there we go so uh thanks nitty do we end the stream you just saw probably
people are going god yes please end the stream
all right so uh so that's p p90 next is p103 so this is second or third century
so we're not even sure like this could be a third like like we date these things based on the
handwriting so you can imagine that there's a very you know there there's there's a range right
so it could be as late as like 220 230 so comes from a codex
math you yeah so okay so that was my question is like so we date these is a primarily only
with handwriting analysis or is yeah or are there like other like do we do any carbon dating with
this stuff is that not accurate enough we we uh no the reason the reason manuscripts aren't carbon
dated is because um you have to you have to emulate the material so you know uh people are
kind of antsy about uh destroying portions of their very very very valuable tiny little bits
of papyrus and parchment as you can imagine so um now i will say that there are manuscripts that
have been carbon dated and the carbon dating helps to um calibrate our paleographical
uh right so when you're when you're when you're dating the handwriting if you use that calibration
based on the carbon dating it's usually pretty accurate so yeah we just want to go to get a
degree you know also like get expertise in paleography like that seems like uh oh there's
places you can go which is it's very very niche so um i could be like a cave in norway or something
like it would be like so niche that like you get trained by monks who only drink a beer or something
we could be the my my dirty little secret is that i don't have an actual degree working in
paleography i had to learn how to do it um from people who do it so i worked with uh people like
michael legoire and like uh daniel stucco benesra um and um who else uh mostly those two but uh
and lots of reading and lots of practice uh to learn how to do paleography and and i don't do
greek paleography i'm just depending on what's been provided here by uh the center for new testament
manuscripts all right this is the last one okay so matthew chapter 21 through all right i remember
video i made i use this very much was that right and look at look at this look at the the the
verso side sorry the recto side no the verso side of this uh of this manuscript and how much ink
has survived there wow it's just very badly damaged so but now so now i have finished
congratulations everyone on this stream has now seen the entire extent of the manuscript evidence
for the gospels that dates to before the year 200 probably and that's it that is all of it
you will notice there is not a single fragment from the gospel of mark or the gospel of luke
um lots of john lots of matthew and very small fragments and that's it that's it
and i think i mean as uh i think this is a major problem um now i don't have reason to suspect
that the texts that we have were dramatically different from the time they were written to
the time of these manuscripts in the second century but importantly i don't know
we don't know right we just don't know
