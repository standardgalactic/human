Big reason why I started deconstructing
was I was actually in debate.
I was a professional debater.
I debated in college.
It was just weird to me that every weekend
I could demand evidence, demand research, demand links.
I had websites that I would tell people
weren't good enough evidence and they needed to find more.
For example, don't give me Wikipedia.
And yet on Sundays, I didn't need any of that.
That's when I started to wonder like,
why is it that I require evidence
and like science and research
and I will defend that stuff to the death.
And yet when it comes to the most important aspect,
my eternal salvation, I don't need to see anything.
I just need to believe in half faith.
