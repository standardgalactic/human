I became convinced that these other people that had religious experiences under different religions
or God concepts were as equally sincere as I was. It immediately, if you're honest, puts you in a
position where you're like, hey, maybe it's a human thing, you know, instead of maybe it's a God
thing. If we're all capable of having these religious experiences, and a lot of people hate
like the new atheist, but it was same Harris's book, Waking Up, that was one of the first times
where I realized like, oh, spiritual experience is a human phenomenon. And it's explained in the
brain. And here's how, and we're all just acting it out in different ways with different stories.
And it was such a huge understanding for me, because that excuse of but not you don't know
my personal relationship with Jesus that I told you about earlier, as like my main fallback,
it gets eradicated as soon as you understand anyone can create this with anything.
