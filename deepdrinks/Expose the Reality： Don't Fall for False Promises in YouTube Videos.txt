When the person is relieved of that demon,
and you see the amazing YouTube video,
where is the video a month later?
They're probably still in abject poverty
or have the same mental illness,
haven't gotten help because their actual need
is medication or whatever the case is.
And it's like, stop showing the highlight
and show the reality, the follow-up is just horrendous.
And that's a perfect example.
A Christian just, they can say anything and it sounds good
and they even probably convince themselves.
Like I pray and I believe God will do this,
but I have no responsibility after this.
I'm a seed planter.
I was told to, you know, if the town doesn't accept me,
move on to the next one.
And it's this entire concept of no responsibility.
And it blows my mind.
