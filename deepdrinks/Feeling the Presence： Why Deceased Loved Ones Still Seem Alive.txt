And so the smells, the pictures, the, you know,
maybe a piece of clothing, a piece of jewelry,
those kinds of things can still trigger that thing
in our mind that tells us that person is there.
And so you frequently have people talking
about feeling the presence of someone
who a deceased loved one or something like that.
Well, you even sit with like someone might say,
I just can't believe they're gone.
I just can't believe like it's this cognitive dissonance
that goes on where it's like,
they occupy this part in your brain
that was like, they are there, they're alive.
And now you know that they're not,
but it doesn't feel like them.
They feel still there.
And that's because when they are there,
your mind is like your experience of their presence
is a combination of the incoming stimuli
and your mind projecting the sense of their presence.
And that projection is still there.
