there's another scene called the widow of Ephesus where this widow is in a tomb because her husband
has died and she's mourning and there are three crucified men outside and a roman soldier guarding
them and he hears her weeping and he goes in and like one thing leads to another and they kind of
start a little relationship in the tomb for three days and three nights and then when the roman
soldier leaves the tomb after he's sort of wooed the widow he realizes that somebody's come and
taking the body down of one of their family members that had been crucified and taken off with
it to give it a proper burial and so they decide to take the body of her dead husband and put him
up on the cross because then that way they you know yeah the soldier knows that the penalty is
going to be death for him
