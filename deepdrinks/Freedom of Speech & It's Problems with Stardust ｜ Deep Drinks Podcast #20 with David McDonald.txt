Welcome to deep drinks podcast where the drinks are deep and the conversations are deeper
It's already said of the introduction. I don't know why I had to repeat it, but today we have a very special guest that is
Stardust who is a political streamer and a bit of a spicy one. So that's going to be really fun
But before I introduce her. I'm going to go over just a quick couple of things. So the first thing is
I'm going to introduce her to the audience
and
I'm going to introduce her to the audience
So this is my first guest
Before I introduce her, I'm going to go over just a quick couple of things.
So the first thing is, if you go to youtube.com slash deep drinks for those listening, you
can subscribe because when we get to a thousand subscribers, we're going to be doing a charity
stream.
I'll be doing six hours.
I might watch a Kenneth Copeland old cowboy film, if you don't know what that is, look
up Treasure Mountain, it is a hoot until we might be doing that, might be having some
fun and games.
We're doing a charity stream to raise money for a good charity.
So if you're into that kind of thing and you like this kind of content, make sure you subscribe
to youtube.com slash deep drinks.
Also, if you like listening to these podcasts, they're available on all podcasting apps.
So you know, Spotify, Apple Music, all that kind of stuff.
So if you like listening on your way to work, you can do that there too.
And if anyone is looking for a good episode, Derek Lambert, Surviving Heroine and Religion
is a really good one.
And I really, really enjoy the one with Alyssa Alexander, who was an ex-mormon who literally
got married in the temple and then deconstructed her faith and talks about like the first
moments where, you know, she would, she would like have a sin day and they would drive to
another town to go get like her and her husband would drive to the town to go get like coffee
because coffee was a sin and they wanted to try it for the first time and they didn't
know what to do and stuff.
So it's a really cool story.
But with that said, I'm going to introduce our guest today.
So Stardust is a political streamer with a reputation for controversy, gaining many
haters on both sides of the political aisle.
Stardust has engaged in debates and conversations with Nazis, white separatists, conspiracy
theorists, transphobes, misogynists and many others.
Stardust has a strong stance against the platforming, as you can tell.
Stardust is also known much like myself for coming up with grotesque and morally uncomfortable
hypothetical thought experiments, which test the boundaries of acceptable conversation
and sometimes strained friendships.
So we may hear some of those today.
A friend of mine described Stardust like this, she's like a progressive, but a progressive
that's always on the edge of being canceled.
So with that said, welcome Stardust.
Hi, thank you so much for having me.
Can you hear me okay?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Is that accurate?
Like how my friend described you with, she's like a progressive, but a progressive that's
always on the edge of being canceled?
I think that's pretty accurate.
I really don't mean to be there.
It's always by accident, but yeah, it just seems to always happen.
So Stardust is also streaming on your end.
So hello to all of, well, I'm probably getting notifications because I watch your stream.
So hello to all Stardust subscribers.
My name is Dave.
So what are we drinking today Stardust?
So on deep drinks, the guest always chooses the drink.
Well, I chose zero sugar ginger ale.
So I have it here with me.
I don't really drink alcoholic drinks too much.
I do partake in weed occasionally.
So but yeah, just figured, you know, this has been like my, I'm a little bit addicted
to it right now.
And I think it's good.
It's good.
Yeah, it's good.
To be honest, like a lot of guests feel like they have to drink alcohol, but you don't
have to drink alcohol.
In fact, sometimes I appreciate not having to drink like hard liquor at 8 30 in the morning.
So because right now I'm in Australia and it's brutal because it wipes the whole day
because like, you know, I tell myself I'm going to be productive and I'm not.
I end up just not slowing on the couch, eating chips or whatever the day is wiped.
So I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, I chose ginger ale also partly because if you're feeling sick ever, ginger ale is
great for soothing your stomach.
So yeah, yeah, true.
It's like the ginger.
My wife's currently pregnant and she's just like sucking on like ginger things all the
time and stuff.
Yeah, you're in solidarity with her now.
It's awesome.
Exactly.
That's it.
That's it.
So I was going to like, first of all, ask like where your political leanings are, but
I really wanted to start this interview off with some some some Schumer because you don't
get you don't get this.
You don't get this in America, but have you you're a political streamer, right?
So like it is a crime to me.
Have you ever heard that you haven't heard of this person?
Have you ever heard of Bob Catter?
I don't think so.
How do you spell last name?
K-A-T-T-E-R.
K-A-T-T-E-R.
You probably don't.
I'm a Australian politician.
Okay.
So he I just wanted to because like and you know, your audience needs to see this.
This man has a seat in Parliament in Australia and I just want to show you two clips of what
what we deal with over here on in Australia.
He's become a bit of a meme in the Australian community.
So I want to show you two clips by him and then I want to get your response.
So he's he's he's quite far right and he's he's quite popular in the state that I live
in, which is like the Texas, I guess, of of of Australia.
So this is him.
I'll show the first clip, which is him talking about gay marriage.
I mean, you know, people are in the final to the sexual proclimates, you know, I mean,
let there be a thousand blossoms blooms, but I spent any time on it because in the meantime,
every three months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland.
I OK, so I barely understood what he said, but that's quite the voice on him.
So he's like, let a thousand blossoms bloom when he's talking about that.
But he just switches from like that to I spent on any time on it.
Like, we've got to listen to it again.
Hang on.
People are entitled to the sexual proclimates, you know, I mean,
let there be a thousand blossoms blooms, but I spent any time on it because,
wow, in the meantime, every three months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile
in North Queensland.
Well, what is with the crocodile?
OK, I'm not spending any time on it because somebody dies from a crocodile.
So, yeah, it's so weird.
There's other clips of him like in in Parliament saying like, oh, the LGBT
and he's like, oh, whatever you call yourself.
He's like, I'm not going to spend time on that.
What it is, it's just he's a big meme.
But he's like, you always change the words.
So that's a classic clip.
But this is my this is my second favourite clip, but it's still a great clip.
So he is 11.
His grandfather was Lebanese immigrant to Australia.
Oh, wow.
And so someone's asking him, is his is his party racist?
And he's saying, you know, we can't take them, you know, Muslim immigrants anymore.
He says the Allah Akbar people is similar to Trump in that way.
Not to I hope I'm not offending you if you.
No, no, I'm good.
Cool, cool, cool.
But what's also funny about this one is someone points out,
isn't your grandfather Lebanese and you can just hear in the background
and then he gets so triggered at that.
And it's just funny to watch.
So I thought you'd appreciate this.
Finally, yeah, get out of this country.
You're not wanted here.
This country will belong to Allah Akbar.
And as I say, God would be ashamed if his name was being used by these extremists.
And there's a lot of good people coming out from those countries,
but we can't afford to take the risks anymore.
No, he's not.
This is Australia.
And I resent strongly you describing him as Lebanese.
That is a racist comment.
Wow.
You should take it back and you should be ashamed of yourself for saying it in public.
How does it racist?
Yeah, no, it's funny.
Hey, so it could just been a normal response.
Like, no, my grandfather's not Lebanese, but he got offended by that.
Wow.
Even your grandfather's Lebanese, how do you feel about it?
No, it's not.
It's just straight.
And I resent strongly you describing him as Lebanese.
That is a racist comment.
And you should take it back and you should be ashamed of yourself for saying it in public.
so someone and then at the end someone asks him which is this part now so is
your party racist it's not that's not really an answer to the question is your
party racist and then he says this I just told you we are Australians and we
are absolutely yes it is yes it is an answer to your question so it's not
then I feel sorry for you so I just want to clarify this man has a seat in
Parliament like okay so like this is like we have some fun stuff in Australia
as well and I'm only just getting into politics myself so I thought who better
to have on but yourself you know I really like Australian politics one of
the most I look I wanted the most as a woman in the political sphere it's very
easy to to doubt yourself to second-guess everything that you say you
know men tend to be more confident when they kind of launch into things with
politics women tend to like second-guess themselves more one thing I always
look at as inspiration as I look at that Julia Gillard speech or she's like I
will not be lectured about misogyny from a misogynist and I used to put that on
listen to that whenever I was feeling not very confident in and speaking on
politics and stuff like that so yeah I do have an appreciation for Australian
politics so cool yeah it's good I can't leave you even knew the name Julia
Gillard the only thing I remember about her her time was that she got up on
stage once and pretended as if there was a zombie apocalypse because of the the
because of the walking dead so she's like the government has been overrun by
zombies blah blah blah and I was like what it was just a funny joke but I was
like this is so weird that this is the world we've been yeah um so again yeah
go oh I was just gonna say her she um she had 15 minutes to prepare a speech
after this big scandal came out she had 15 minutes she prepared a speech and it
was like such a banger speech just prepared in 15 minutes and she was
calling everybody out she was saying I will not be lectured she was saying you
know the leader of the opposition should be embarrassed if he wants to talk about
misogyny then let me tell you about this this this this this and it was like all
these examples of the opposition being misogynistic and he was trying to come
at her for supporting a misogynist so it was really cool that she prepared that
in 15 minutes went up there and absolutely slammed everybody it was
super cool so that's cool I really like Kevin Rudd did something similar do
you know who Kevin Rudd is I don't know he did something similar we won't
talk about Australian politics this whole time everyone I'm sorry but Kevin
Rudd is like did something similar where this a Christian came to him and asked
him in the audience like you know how how can you how can you call yourself
Christian and accept like gay marriage whatever and then he like quoted the
Bible and quoted things in the Bible about like well do you think we should
own slaves and then you know because if you don't think we should own slaves
then like essentially like fuck off but then like and he's like and also I
think that the message of Jesus is to love people blah blah blah and he just
like dropped like this this dude was like in the audience and you just he had
nothing to say like he was just like it was so good and I wish I saw that back
in the day when I was still religious myself so just just like could you like
classify what are you like what type of like what is your political background
like how did you get interested in politics where your political innings
now yeah so I've always been interested in politics since a young age my my
grandfather in India was actually a politician on my mom's side so I think
it kind of runs in the blood for us to be like interested in politics when I was
younger I guess I always talked about it and I was took an interest in it but I
never like pursued it seriously it was just something that was kind of like a
hobby for me and I my mom always raised me with like you know she's a feminist
so she raised me with like you know feminist ideals which is interesting you
know with the background of like South Asian and Muslim in us and you know the
gender pressures the social pressures that come upon you as a female in those
cultures right even in American culture there are social pressures that you kind
of are born into as a female but you know she tried to raise me with those
ideals I mean I think there are still things that kind of because South Asian
culture and and Muslim culture has such strict gender roles it's hard to kind of
break out of those but she she raised me with that and then she was always a bit
on the progressive side so I was progressive too she used to actually
funny when I was younger and I didn't really know much about politics she's
put Bill O'Reilly on while we were eating dinner just to see how I would
react to it and it's not like we talked about politics very often but I would
sit there and I listened to Bill O'Reilly and I would get so upset listening every
day and I had no idea why we were listening to him because he just would
say the most insane things and I was like 10 or something listening to Bill
O'Reilly my mom wouldn't say anything about it unless I said something I would
be like oh my god he's saying he's being so dramatic right now and she'd be like
yeah he's being dramatic one day finally I couldn't take it anymore it's like can
we please not listen to Bill O'Reilly while we're eating dinner I can't I can't
handle it anymore I don't like it she was like oh yeah okay I'm like we could
have done that this whole time I've been tortured by Bill O'Reilly every day at
dinner for what but yeah I guess it was your mama Bill O'Reilly fan or was she
just doing it to like see what your reaction would be I think she was just
doing it to see my reaction that makes so that's you do that like with people
you'd like to just like drop that same thing in like drop things in to see how
people react that makes so much sense I can see that you do the same thing yeah
yeah I don't I and I don't think she was even doing it to be funny I think she
was just trying to see what would happen because my brother was already you know
like a dem and and it's not like she had anybody to experiment on so I was there
and she would like play that stuff and then she wouldn't say anything about it
but but I would unless I commented on it then she would then she would say
something but yeah it's interesting yeah and then so when I was in high school I
got involved in like advocacy for like LGBTQ rights for gay marriage and stuff
like that I ended up being part of like the LGBTQ club there and ended up being
the president eventually and I think that's when I really first started
getting into political advocacy because I went out and Obama just got elected when
I was a senior in high school and so I went out and I collected signatures and
I think I collected like a ridiculous amount like 300 or something for this
petition that we were going to mail to Obama so when he came in on his first
day in office he had this big stack this big petition basically to legalize
gay marriage and so yeah yeah it was really cool and I remember I met up with
like college students around that time and they were like wow you have so many
more signatures than we do and I was like really like you know like wow that's
cool so yeah it was um it was it was cool I was involved in that way I always
it's funny because I thought I was very left-leaning when I was in high school
and in college until I started participating in Twitch politics and
then I realized I'm really not that left-leaning I'm just like center left
so yeah it's all about perspective I guess but yeah oh but like do you really think that
so there's like there's left and then there's like twitch left right like there's like
twitch left is like you know isn't twitch left like you know vosh like communist anarchist like
destroy a lot of socialists a lot of yeah okay yeah right so yeah because I think I think I'm
center left if I do like political compass tests and things like that myself like I'm
left with progressive issues economic issues or seem to be the center but I'm also a dummy I don't
know anything about politics I'm trying to learn myself so I'm kind of a dummy so yeah you've been
doing it a lot longer though yeah I don't think you're well when it comes to social issues I was
always involved from a young age but when it comes to like economic stuff that's not something I
really took an interest in learning about until recently and even in college I took like macro
and micro economics but I wasn't a I wasn't a a politics person in college I went to a very
politically active college but I um I was a music major like so well while we had protests and stuff
and we and I interacted with a lot of the politics crowd and stuff um I I wasn't a politics person
I didn't really pay attention to economic stuff so yeah yeah true even my mod is in chat saying
star is very bad at economics truth that's cool um the I just I actually um uh wanted to ask you so
I didn't feel free not to answer this but I you so you said you're the president of the LGBT
kind of club that or not club but like political group in the school is that right yeah the
yeah LGBTQ club or whatever it was I don't even remember what we called it so are you are you
like an ally or are you like a member of I identify as like bisexual um you know I my first adult
relationship was with a woman um so you know it's uh you know I I care about that kind of stuff
and I have a lot of friends who are really like that yeah yeah I am the first person I interviewed
on deep drinks was um my friend um Colin who who actually was closeted for 45 years um I met him
I met him in ministry college so he never had a relationship never never did anything I met him
in church ministry college training to be a pastor and um and yeah we and actually at the time that
my faith was unraveling was the same time the same sex marriage public I was coming through
Australia and we were voting one whether or not um gay people should have human rights
and be able to get married and um that's a joke but it's kind of true but um but uh and we would
have coffee like every like every few days and he would talk about how distressing it was that he
was part of a church that was like spouting all this hate um and how and and I was like unraveling
my faith and that those conversations really I think cemented cemented the the kind of path I
went on um so I've had a lot of people uh I've had some I got a lot of like respect for people who
have had to like struggle with religion religious intolerance and um social intolerance when it
comes to LGBT issues and that's like you can see whenever I do this this deep drinks podcast is a
lot more chill than um then my main channel but my main channel like I've argued with Muslims and
other Christians and stuff and that's the one thing that like I get really triggered at um
one guy goes are you one Muslim guy I was debating recently goes are you gay because you got so
triggered I'm like no because I'm so sick of I hate the the the homophobia that's just like
everywhere in society it really pisses me off um because I saw it with my friend um I go so far as
to say um because we're you know I mentioned before my wife and I did IVF and we've got a heavy
FS baby on the way and I always make the joke that if they were straight I'd still love them um I'll
love them anyway um anyway so um so what do you say you classify self probably as like center left
now um is that like libertarianism or is that uh I'd say like liberal I'm sympathetic to libertarian
values like individual liberty but I think liberal like liberalism seems to work really well so okay
so what I'll do is I've got because I'm still learning about politics I've just got a bunch
of issues right and there's no wrong answers and I'm going to like run them run them by you and
you just tell me quickly what your position is on those things and if you don't have one that's
totally cool um healthcare so I think yeah healthcare I think that the american healthcare
system is very bogged down uh due to a lot of different reasons um but uh I think uh and actually
I did it a whole group project working with like united healthcare and a whole bunch of other people
when I was um back when I was uh in school um but uh but basically we worked to like design a new
way to make it more efficient but I think mainly my my takeaways is that I think there needs to be
a universal option for people um I think that uh I think that with a universal option you'll get much
more bargaining power as a group and you'll be able to make healthcare more affordable for the
average person um I would like there to be a universal healthcare eventually in America I
think that would be really great but I think right now um a universal option uh maybe look
in Medicare buy-in uh uh would be um beneficial to the country cool um this is an area that um
we might disagree with because of our upbringings because you were born in America but bearing arms
guns guns uh you know I'm gonna be honest with you I'm not really sure how I feel on it anymore um
I personally like I see the problems with guns in America but also I am not somebody who's into
trampling on other people's rights but I know that there are other countries European countries
and other countries that have gun rights um that don't have the gun violence rates that we do so I
I guess I would be interested in learning more about that true um freedom of speech and this
is something we'll get into later but yeah what do you what do you thoughts on freedom of speech
quickly I think I'm pretty I'm pretty close to being in uh uh I'm pretty close to being a freedom
of expression absolutist um with exceptions right uh like legal activity shouldn't be uh allowed and
and inciting uh violence you know on people probably shouldn't be allowed but um other
than that I'm pretty close to being a freedom of speech absolutist so okay uh so this one is a bit
of an interesting one because you've actually had you've actually had discussions with Richard
Spencer who's is he still a white separatist or a white nationalist uh he is yeah I think he's an
ethnat but in a spiritual way it's kind of hard to describe yeah okay so um yeah so ethno states
let's say and just to clarify so let's say there's a group of people who say and there doesn't have
to be white people let's say like we want an all you know white um state or country and we want
the majority of people like what do you think about that uh I mean they can just move to like
one of the european countries that's mostly white right like there are plenty of them why
why do you need to make a new one there are plenty of them if you want to go move to them go move to
them but america is built on uh immigration and diversity and um some of our greatest achievements
have been because of the mixing of different cultures um uh which is something you learn
actually surprisingly within a uh within a music career you you learn uh very quickly the value of
diversity and how um america is probably one of america's biggest exports is the music
and the art and the entertainment industry that we have and part of the reason why it's so
successful is because of the innovations of black people the innovations of mixed people
and the mixing of cultures and making something completely new so awesome yeah um but i'm with
you right there but let's say there was a group of people um like uh let's say native americans who
said we want to have our own state where it's only native americans would you see something
either a lot ideologically would you ideologically oppose that i mean that's a hard one because obviously
we already have reservations um so i think people you know we have reservations i'm but i would say
i think i support more direct investment into minority communities uh to help people um kind of
like level the the playing field um to help people um achieve and make up for um the ways
that they've been wrong in the past i think direct investment in communities is better than
making a separate state cool protected classes protected classes so um for like
transgender individuals um races things like that
so uh you know how like um bill c16 in um in um canada correct me if i'm wrong but
they make it makes it illegal to like um uh misgender someone um in a way to in a deliberate
way to cause them like suffering and um and whatever and the same thing with like you can't
have like a sign that says blacks cannot enter or whatever on a on a store because of the protected
class classes yeah so what do you think about what are your opinions on protected classes um i mean i
think uh i think i yeah i think it's necessary right i mean like protected classes i think i think
the way to approach this is like we shouldn't allow discrimination based on uh immutable
characteristics uh and that applies to everybody regardless of whether they're a protected class
or not so true true okay so would you like would you want to strip back like if you had like a
magic button and you could strip back protective classes like from law would you do that or are
you not sure uh i don't i i guess i'm not sure i guess i'm not quite sure where uh like what you
mean by protected classes i i think like i think right now you know like you know uh
like like groups of people you can't discriminate against like certain groups of people
based on things like race gender um so sexual orientation things like that right aren't they
aren't there like laws that say that you can't do that yeah there are laws that say that you
can't do that and i think um yeah protected classes are basically immutable characteristics so i have
no problem with that oh you can't you can't help what you're born into right yeah exactly um my
thoughts exactly um and borders borders um based on like uh like the econ stuff i've read um having
open borders would be uh you know economically beneficial i don't think that's something we
can do in america yet um uh but um you know i i think um i think eventually one day not not today
but eventually one day maybe um it would be a good thing to have uh slightly more open we
know that immigration benefits benefits a local economy uh greatly um more than it takes from it
so yeah i guess that's my my thought on it hey cool uh so the person who um described you as a
progressive but a progressive that's always on the edge of being cancelled is in the chat and they
said they asked a question and i think it's a joke walls do they work walls do they work uh
that's a good question yeah um i don't know if they do i think we we see that they don't really
uh good fine i think that's just a name um cool so let's jump into the meat of this like freedom
of speech so let's have a discussion on freedom of speech um i'm not sure how i feel about this issue
um and i want you to i want to let's have a conversation about because i'd like to to hear
your side of the your side of it and then like talk about the pros and cons so what do you what's
your like large perspective of freedom of speech so you said before that you don't like the idea
of limiting people's speech but you also um also think that we should be promoting like
illegal activities and things like that um can you explain a little bit more about what you mean
there yeah i think people i would rather it's so hard to i guess i think people um should have
the right to say and express themselves in the way that they want to um i'm a big believer in
freedom of speech and i guess the only thing is that i would say like you know there there are
reasons why um we have laws against inciting violence right uh so if somebody is going around
and saying um we need to take action these people are you know destroying our society they're raping
our children or whatever and they're demonizing a group of people that's probably pretty harmful
rhetoric uh we should probably um do something right uh like if they're saying we need to do
something about this that's like a direct call i feel like to violence or something right so
so do you think it should be like banned from like a governmental level like a not just like
discouraged but like it should be like prison time for like the uh the january six stuffs a good
example right do you think that the people who were like do you think that speech should have been
banned uh i think i think hmm uh so i think trump put a lot of people in danger with his words um
like if we want to even just talk about election officials um he uh put a lot of election officials
who volunteer their time uh to um help uh the wheels of democracy turn uh as they say um election
officials um who have don't have the reach that he does right and he was naming people by name
saying that people were involved in and uh election fraud um with no evidence and this is the president
of the united states saying this about individual citizens that should be um that should be completely
unacceptable in my opinion so yeah but like i guess the i guess the it's a hard it's like a bit of a
tap dance of like it's like a it's a hard line to draw of like where should things become illegal
right so like a great example is like um you know like is it okay for me to just like screaming out
like links to like child pornography in the street or whatever or like something that's like
encouraging illegal activity right yeah i would say no yeah that should be like illegal right like
the there should be like people who like oh i should be arrested right but then
um but then it's like but then
like then it's like also like the misinformation i think the problem is it's like so
and i'm just trying to click my thoughts here but with me and i don't know why i use that example
but me screaming out links to child pornography in the streets that's a fucking weird example but
that um has some harm in that you know you're perpetuating child pornography um let's say
i didn't put the links there myself let's say i just knew about them and i was just telling
everyone about them that's not a good idea because it's it's directing people to this thing that's like
you know evil discussing objectively wrong um and that causes harm but i would say that there
are other examples of of speech that we consider acceptable but i would say causes more harm than
me screaming links to child pornography that this is such a so somebody in chat makes a good
point about that so so yelling the links isn't going to be illegal because you're just stating a fact
but telling people to go to those links would be illegal okay do you think that like if i wasn't
telling people if i was just like let's say i'll like instead of instead of being in the street
let's say i was like joe ragan or whatever and i was like well there's this link and well there's
no child porn on that link and let's say the governments couldn't take this link down for
whatever reason and i was just like oh if you want to go to this link i mean i wouldn't recommend it
but it's there like do you think that should be banned i'm sorry to use such a fucked example too
like i know it i i think uh why why would he be uh i i guess i would ask why are you per why are
you spreading this like why why would you spread the harm of of children i guess you know um
it's i mean yeah there's a million questions but like should that he should like a SWAT team
like burst through the windows of a joe ragan experience live and like you know he likes
free stop doing that like i don't know about a SWAT team but i think we can i i don't know about
a SWAT team but i think um i think definitely take him off the air after that right like at least
take him off the air for that that would be in a way he is hinting it at his audience so um even
if he's explicitly saying no we know he's hinting at it he knows what what the result is going to be
um yeah i think you know if somebody were doing that if you like take them off the air that is
just yeah unacceptable to to bring to bring it to a more of a real example than joe ragan
screaming at links of child porn um to bring to a real example um in 1998 like andrew wakefield
produces like fraudulent like report on vaccines with the mmr vaccine and hinted at a link between
the mmr vaccine and autism um and that one paper that one 1998 lancer paper that was later retracted
a year later and 11 uh 10 of the uh 12 co-authors retracted the supposition the 11th couldn't be
reached for comment um retracted their involvement in it because of that one paper you see this huge
spread of like of vaccine hesitancy amongst mothers who are afraid the children are going to get
autism that has objectively resulted in the deaths of many children many children um and like the
suffering and pain of so many people and like as you know the science organizations they did what
they could they they took they retracted the paper when they discovered that he used fraudulent
research methodologies um there was like follow-up research there was um you know there was there was
within the establishment there was so much that was done to try and um to try and like
fix the damage that had been done but but it like it's still as you can see like vaccine
hesitancy is still a really huge thing um so it's like that that was like an area where like
the heat like the freedom the freedom of speech is caused like direct harm um to society i would
argue um but whether or not we should ban that is the arguments like the arguments for banning
that kind of speeches would end up in like this you tell like it's a slippery slope where like
eventually how do you know like how do you trust what's true like who determines what's true it's
not true so yeah apparently the the um the hesitancy had already existed before that but
he definitely fanned the flames with that that research uh i don't know what the solution is
there on it to be honest with you i think the lancet were tracking it i think scientific
organizations um saying that like that um that research was fraudulent and it doesn't meet the
standards of scientific uh you know um publications uh i think that's that is good i don't know what
we can do to mitigate the harm of that um yeah i wonder if there's like an avenue that
scientific publication could maybe go uh to um you know sue people who submit fraudulent stuff
but uh i don't know what the i don't know what the uh solution is there to be quite honest with you
so yeah i'm the same i i also worry um and this kind of brings us into our next section but
when you when you kind of when you kind of give the scientific establishment like
if they started suing people you can just see the conspiracy theorists like brains exploding um
and if there's what you know i can't stand the conspiracy theorist mentality because i was once
like a 9-11 truth or i was once a creationist and i can see how their thinking works and i can see
like it's it's it's it's really bothersome um bothersome to me but um but you can see the
direct harm but the problem is if you push back against that harm you're almost creating you're
almost perpetuating the problem yeah i mean some uh again uh you know there's something to be learned
at least from this right um and uh somebody said to counter the autism study without us importing
scientists to push us to win the space race we never would have developed many life-saving
technologies and won the cold war uh i guess that's that's interesting as well but um
wait what was that can you say that again yeah somebody said to counter the autism study without
the us importing Nazi scientists to push us to win the space race we never would have developed
many life-saving technologies and won the cold war uh so is that like is is it like an ends
justify the mains argument i'm not really sure uh i understand the argument um sorry i should have
maybe understood the argument before i've read it no that's maybe they're not even making an
argument maybe they're just saying stuff yeah maybe they are yeah um but i don't i don't really know
i think you know scientific standards were at least uh um made more strict after that at least
that is a good thing that came out of the uh out of that study right even if the all this bad stuff
came out it was already like a sentiment that existed and um at least now they are very strict
with their standards so um yeah yeah yeah so there's some good to come out of that um for sure so um
um like so how do you feel then like moving into that like how do you see okay let me have a bit
of preamble at my full scale so i i've noticed that um i i sometimes worry because i'm like i said
i'm quite progressively left i sometimes worry that with the backlash that the left gives to
people who are maybe on the fence with things like trans issues um borders um
you know you get you get like a teenager who truly doesn't know what they think and they watch
like Steven Crowder or someone talk about like what is a woman or Ben Shapiro or whatever
and they have some legitimate questions and they like talk to a lefty online or someone online
and the lefty has to assume that they're coming with like mellison tent and then like yells at them
or whatever or de-platforms them or does whatever and then they get pushed right into the arms of
like the alt right and the alt right are there with like open arms are saying come here we told you
the lefties are crazy um and i worry that de-platforming is also is is also something that that does
that what are your thoughts on de-platforming i think it can um so de-platforming generally
is something that's done to people who are already like established in their beliefs and stuff but
yeah there are moderate conservatives that get pushed out of spaces because people uh get hyper
vigilant about basically canceling anybody who has an opposing view and i don't think that's very
healthy when we know that like 90 of the global population is transphobic races they get it in
some way right that's like we live we live in a minority like the the uh you know the progressive
society is something that's a minority in the world so i i don't think it's reflective of the world
for us to be um automatically pushing out anybody who doesn't have the most progressive beliefs i
think we need to make space for people who don't have the most progressive beliefs and uh and allow
them to exist in these spaces and engage with them okay you said something okay that's that's
interesting but you said something there that i want to what do you mean by 99% of the world or
whatever is not maybe not 99% of the world but like whatever i would say i would say 80 to 90%
of the world see you know most of the world most of the average person in the world is bigoted in
some way whether that's like sexism racism anti-semitism uh transphobia um like we live
in progressive societies you and i but um but globally i think if you talk to the average person
that's like they don't know anything about trans issues they don't know anything about
even sexism or racism right um so uh so i think we need to make space for moderates right uh like
at least moderates because even people who aren't aren't moderates i just think um i just think it's
not reflective of the world that we live in and if you want to change minds the way to do it is not
push people out uh it's to engage in conversation with them i agree okay i agree with you there i
think um i think i'm maybe misunderstood before like i would say that um like i'm i i'm a feminist in
the definition of the word i'm a um i'm an LGBT ally like love my trans people love my
you know gays lesbians like it's all good like i'm not racist like i i i love everyone right
i'm trying to be i try to be as progressive as possible and if i have like niggling feelings
that that that or stereotypes i try and push hard against that but i hope that my kids or my
grandkids watch these videos and see something in me that are like holy shit that dude was
fucked up or whatever like i hope society continues to get better continues to get like
more progressive more um uh more um fair for every group of people more fair for everyone um
so that's kind of where i i kind of sit with with that stuff like i try to be the best person i can
be but i also acknowledge that i hope that i hope that i'm seen as immoral in the future you know what
i mean like i hope that i hope that people look at me and go like oh yeah like he was good for
his time like it's like you know how do you like Seinfeld yeah yeah you're a good person then yeah
Seinfeld great right great show and it was it was awesome for the time but there are like
so many people who say like oh it's misogynistic or it's um um and it is a little bit like misogynistic
or uh you know and uh and stuff but it's like it was good for the time like they have that joke
it's like oh you know is that person gay it's like and they go oh no there's anything wrong with that
and like they they kind of um and today that wouldn't be cool kind of but back then great
so i hope people look at me if you shouldn't go like like i was yeah a little bit you know
oh that's a little bit dated you know but yeah yeah when i say like people majority of the world is
like is bigoted in some sense like i don't think people um go out with hate in their hearts or
are necessarily hateful but i think the average person in the world like you know uh it like
might see like uh something that they're not used to and be like oh my god you i don't want to see
that again you know like that's not that i think the average person you know in the world just
doesn't think that hard about it and i think we need to make space for for moderates and for
people who are like that who just don't think about things like that uh because uh you know
they're they're there you know they're they uh you know they exist uh it's it's the majority of the
world is it seems to me to be that way and just seems silly for us to put ourselves in a bubble
so do you think um just to like do a random aside on the ooh what is that do you have you
notice like well you probably have like um when i i hang around like when i'm hanging around with
my mates or whatever like at least not now but like you know five ten years ago like iRL whatever
if there are like two dudes kissing on tv they're like oh they don't like it like when they say two
men kissing two two women totally fine everyone's okay with two women like no one's got an issue
with two women but two men like people like uh a lot of my mates don't like it um i have a theory
about this i want to know what your theory is and um what if you agree with this i think the reason
people don't like it is because it actually causes sexual arousal that it's it's the disconnect
between the sexual arousal of what they're saying because it's a sexual act that they're saying um
and uh and who they're they're um usually attracted to does it make sense so it's like the disconnect
between a sexually arousing thing that you're watching and someone you're not attracted to
yeah i i guess so yeah i i mean it's interesting i don't really think about it that deeply but
you might have something there you might be on to something so i think we're a lot of things very
deeply um um so okay um what was that up to yeah so do you think we should we should
do platform like hateful speech that's hard um i mean it depends on what type of hateful
speech right like i think platforms are private companies right so if twitter wants to protect
their brand and i think they have the right to do that uh same with face both are youtube
they they should have the right to protect their brand um but uh you know hateful stuff exists um i
think there should be some place online where i guess people go wild or whatever um just for
just just because i think it's necessary for there to be some sort of space online that is um
you know free speech place uh but i think yeah if you're a private company running a platform i
don't see a problem with you like moderating things to reflect your brand um it just kind of
sucks in my opinion you know so um yeah just just sucks so um it depends also like is the
hate speech like inciting violence right you know that's that's a huge thing so if it's inciting
violence then yeah i would say we don't really need that um uh but if it's just somebody saying
that they dislike something or they don't see the reason why people need this thing uh maybe
not de-platforming them we should have the ability to express political beliefs that are different
so yeah and from a more pragmatic um perspective i saw that you had a um you're in a conversation
with a bunch of people who were um like step spouting some like really racist like
disgusting stuff um and you just started to just flip the script and just start trolling them
and you came up with that like really fucked up hypothetical um why did you do that uh maybe
you probably don't know what i'm talking about um the the it's i'll put a link in the description
for anyone who wants to watch it but it's the video that you uploaded said this needs to be
uploaded now it's like amazing um what was it called was it the one where i i uh asked somebody
whether they'd bang their mom or their dad or maybe it wasn't that it was like it was the human
centipede yeah yeah human centipede yeah amazing i if they're gonna say nasty things to me they're
gonna say outrageous things to me i feel like i have the right to say outrageous things to them
too right so um yeah i just feel like you know what if they're gonna be that ridiculous i should
be able to be as ridiculous as i need to and if they're gonna make disgusting jokes about me and
say disgusting things about me and i should be able to say things about them too so i really
really uh upped my bullying when i go onto those onto those panels so uh yeah so instead of like
engaging in like an honest discourse you just like it seems like there's a thing that switched in
your brain and you're like no i'm just gonna like start fucking with them a little bit yeah yeah
pretty much yeah yeah it's pretty much what happened i think i'm very upset that guy got
very upset he was already on a racist brand then that really set him off so yeah so what was uh can
you give us the hypothetical that you gave everyone i said uh you're in a human centipede um uh with
your mom and your dad you have no choice you are in the middle of of of it um but who would you
choose to be in front of you and who would you choose to be behind you because you can choose
whether your mom's in front or your dad's in front and whether you know who's in who's behind you
you know so who do you choose uh and so that that's the question so great that's such a good
question um yeah true uh i had this conversation once with a um with a with like i was on amigal
doing think this thing called street epistemology do you know what street epistemology is uh yeah
i've heard of that channel uh or at least the channels that kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah
so um i was on there and i was having conversations with people and i had a conversation with um
this person who was telling me like the bible is written about white people four white people
like the jews control everything like this is like the most and i'm and part of street epistemology
is you just ask questions you don't have a pushback you just go okay like interesting um and i did a
whole video like that but eventually he got like real angry and he started like showing up in my
youtube um space all the time and like challenged me to debates and i said yes like nine times um
and eventually he finally figured out how to use like to jump on discord and like debate me
and um the whole time i was just trolling him like he rage quit after 13 minutes as i just kept
laughing at him and like like question him and stuff and it was the best time like i really
brightened my day like i still look back at that with fond memories as he's screaming
that i'm a fat um homophobic slur and uh and i'm just like i just brings joy to my heart
that i pissed him off so much that he rage quit yeah i agree and then they call uh they call
like people like us emotional and they have outbursts like that it's like i know it's the
one who's emotional here you're you're acting like a woman honestly i mean by your standards you know
right yeah he goes uh he said to me he goes you're not even a natural man like what does that mean
like he was so what is that even meaning yeah and he goes um what is something else he said it was
he was just like he was like unhinged at one point he like he started asking me my age and i was like
why is he asking me my age like this guy has a bitch you channel i didn't know if he was gonna
like try and dox me or whatever not that my name's there but um and i was like i gave him my name
and then he's like well you should listen to me because i'm older than you so i know more about
life than you i just like lost my shit and like just laughing just like and he got so triggered and
he was screaming it was the best best time best time and that's what you got to do
yeah um so um when you're interviewing i got a couple last questions and we'll wrap up because
i know you've got a show at 8 15 so i'll go through Q&A if anyone has any um any um questions make
sure you leave them in the description and if your um your chat has any um questions they
can ask you and you can read them out as well um start us but i have just as we wrap things start
to wrap things up i wanted to talk to you about tribalism a little bit uh i noticed that when
you're talking to richard spencer i watched that interview in preparation for this stream and i
noticed that he seems and i noticed that amongst all sort of white nationalists like richard spencer
nick fuentes they seem to like make prescriptions based on like groupings of people like arbitrary
groupings of people so like um you know white people are like x and like to do x and should do x
or y or z and um you know and brown people are like x y z and they're like they seem to like
it's like their brain doesn't have the ability to like see people as individuals they see like
groups like tribes right um and i'm i'm wondering like i want to ask these people and maybe you've
asked them like why can't why can't we do the same thing for people who have mustaches or you know
group all the mustache people together or group people who into motorsports or group girls who
love harry potter or group pickup artists like if i if i think of a pickup artist i can more if i
think of like like a pickup artist i can more see them in my head like i know how they dress i know
how they probably talk i know what haircut they have more than like any race of people
yeah so the reason why they they do that is because they there's like the they fundamentally
believe in race realism right uh and so race realism is like this uh idea that um that certain
races have certain biological traits um and so that's why they would say that that's why they
believe that these races are so different um and that's why they think that there are certain
prescriptions for these races i would say spencer is a little bit different from puentes and that
though that he thinks that um he thinks that just different races of people um just don't work well
together and he thinks that they should all have their own separate places um and which makes uh
you know which kind of makes him he's very good at being spencer is very good at being sympathetic
towards minorities who have been marginalized by by like the uh the majority um he's really really
good at that you can see his debate from like four years ago where he's talking about the
native americans on on the reservation how bad he feels for them and that he hopes that as a people
they you know they become strong again and they uh find um you know their spirit again and and he uh
and he's good at talking to people like that and talking on those issues and making that idea of
racial separatism be really um appealing to people right and so um so i would say he's different in
that sense um but yeah i think fundamentally they all believe in race realism and that's why
they think that there are certain prescriptions for certain people and that's why they think that
it's better off to have um puentes is more he wants him a white majority uh america to be a
white majority country um uh i think spencer these days i don't really know what he wants i think
he just wants separate places for separate people um so uh but yeah i'm not really a fan or i don't
i don't believe in race realism i you know i think it's uh you know there's there's there's like
obviously your your uh the person you are today is is informed by like genetics and stuff like that
but like when it comes to iq um if you have an average iq your your your quality of life is not
going to be that different from somebody who has an above average iq the only time your quality
of life is going to be noticeably different from somebody based on your iq is if you are like
developmentally disabled right like at a certain point sure you know iq can mean more success in
certain areas in your life um and better outcomes and stuff like that but at the end of the day like
are you still able to be uh are you still able to take care of yourself is is the main question
right and as long as you're able to do that then yeah so what do you say like i just don't
yeah i i get i i get what you're saying but like if you said to these like groups of people like
if you're having a conversation with nick or richard or whatever like why why don't group
people into these other character characteristics of things they choose and create like they would
probably say yeah so so they would say that the the relationship the genetic relationship the
they think that the biology that links people via race is more important than
than any biology that links people through like mustaches the the peculiarity to grow a mustache
so uh yeah okay but it's yeah and when they say when you say important i imagine that have that
have some like super spiritual like reason they wouldn't have like a reason that's like grounded
in like a prescriptive reality a prescription right well i think a lot of them base their
ideas of race realism off of the charles murray book um the i think the bell curve um so
they base it off of that um a lot of them uh but i think yeah they just um i think for spencer who
would probably view um the importance of like your biology and your ethnic background from
more spiritual lens maybe so i just said um iq isn't a reliable metric for getting intelligence
the tests are also racist and classist there are some uh yeah there are there are there is
some evidence that it is classist um and there is some evidence that like for example in the state
of california that um that there may be some race-based element of it that makes certain people
perform worse on it um uh so yeah i don't think that's completely untrue um i think i think that uh
when they did like the they did some sort of doc grid test in the state of california and then
found that like black people and white people performed um about equally on it um so uh
even still like what i just don't get the and maybe i'm just ranting the i just don't get the
prescription like why why like we don't we don't just like what is this like fucking 2000 bc like
we don't just like like even if we have like mentally retarded people like people who have
severe disabilities we don't just ostracize them from the community and send them off into the
wild we go fend for yourself like we we just go okay like this is how we live with like it's it's
even if even if it was true even if like let's say white people were like 50 points like lower in
iq than like um black people or any other group of people like i still think whites should be able
to live amongst everyone else like i don't yeah well it's not even that that big of a difference
i believe that no it's not it's like yeah it's it's like five or yeah five to ten or something
and it's like again as long as your average you have the an average iq your quality of life is
going to be the same as somebody who has a few more iq points than you it doesn't really matter
like that you know iq's good at predicting you know uh outcomes in your life like you know how
much money you make and your level of education but at the end of the day if you're an average
iq individual and then there's somebody else who has like you know a few points higher than you
doesn't really matter you guys are living the same life you guys are in the grand scheme of things
living the same life so yeah exactly exactly uh yeah i i just never really got that it just it
feels like i love what destiny says where he says like it just feels like people i've heard him say
this in like i think it was the jon tron debate like years ago where he just it's like this person
looks different to me and i don't really like that so and then that's where like it starts from
that that's like i mean we can do with poor people poor people on average have lower iqs right
does that mean we all of a sudden kick out all poor people like uh like i don't know like there
are so many ways like you could take iq sure and and you know what let's just take all the
round up all the poor people and put them on an island like i don't know like these are things
that are you know like go back to your own island yeah yeah let's start swimming over and bringing
the shopping carts back it's like get it back to your own it's so stupid um okay cool cool cool cool
cool um and so why did you have a conversation i mean you probably answered this a million times
so why did you have a conversation with richard spencer um i was just curious about him and uh
and i wanted to see what his beliefs were and what he was up to basically right i think he's an
interesting character because he had the entirety of the dissident right turn on him um uh you know
he was like he was like fuentes before fuentes and then the entirety of the dissident right
like absolutely turned on him fuentes hates him all of america first hates him majority of the
dissident right hates him um uh you know a lot of them think he's a fed for some reason um and uh
you know it yeah it's i just think he's an interesting guy it's interesting to see somebody
who is like a superstar and that in that space um and then get completely ostracized by everybody
and see what they're up to and and how they're dealing with with that type of ostracization
have their views changed um and uh and and what is he up to now right and yeah so
did did you um have any like worries that you're maybe platforming bad ideas or did you think
that you could have like a or if he started like spouting like racist stuff would you like push
back hard against it or how do you deal with that like because because for me i worry sometimes like
if i was to have like the world's best um holocaust and iron like that would be
immoral in my opinion to do that um unless i had adequate ways to push back against
like their ideas because like otherwise i'm just like providing a platform for them to just spew
whatever they want to spew how did you get around that or do you have the same thoughts or concerns
um i don't really because spencer has a much larger audience than i do if anybody's platforming
anybody it's him platforming me um and uh you know um at the end of the day like i think with
people like spencer he's a very polite guy um and and if you come in combative with him
immediately you're just going to look bad he's he's a good speaker you know you just uh you
know you kind of engage with him like a normal human being and um and you know if you're if
you're too much of a jerk to him right off the bat he'll just walk away from the interview you
know like and then i won't get anything out of it so um so yeah i mean i i will ask him probing
questions right i'll ask him like what do you mean by this what do you mean by that you said this
in the past you still believe that um and i think those are questions that that stand to be uncomfortable
enough that um you know it i don't know that there's much pushing back that needs to be done there
when i'm just asking him do you believe in this you know thing that is very dated and nobody else
will lose in right so um yeah so there's um the big meme at the moment on in the community i'm
sure you know is destiny and mr girl and nick fuentes so destiny the streamer political streamer
went out for lunch with nick fuentes um and everyone's lost their mind about it um nick fuentes is the
uh i guess you could call him nazi people call him a nazi i don't know if i'd call him like people
would say he's probably a nazi right um so we're adjacent yeah so what do you well first of all
what are your thoughts on that um i don't think we should be afraid of talking to people like
fuentes and lauren southern and spencer and all these people um uh i think
i think we're just giving it too much power in my opinion like i i i don't want other
women to look at like me turning away from uh an interaction from somebody like that and
viewing me as scared of it um because i don't think we need to be scared of it we live again we
live in a world where a lot of people hold those beliefs um uh outside of our progressive society
and uh what are you gonna do you're gonna just run away from them like we no we just have to deal
with it we have to deal with it and address it head on so yeah are you are you worried for destiny
safety with mr girl uh for his safety why would it be worried for his safety oh are you are you
aware that mr girl is a has a rap album yeah he has a rap album yeah i'd like to play you a
quick little clip from that before we kid okay yo i kill nazis i kill people who talk to nazis
yeah i think uh i'm not too worried because um i'm not too worried because mr girl's uh music
is satire so yeah um yeah uh he says it right there you see you're calling mr girl a liar
start us on on no no satirical satire isn't lies satire is just uh you know satire so yeah it's so
funny um yeah i was at a um i was at a i think it was a part of the other day and a bunch of the
boys like oh we'll talk about mr girl i'm like oh let's um probably music and like so many people
didn't get the context around like um you know i'm a pedophile or uh i kill pedophiles on all those
songs and they were like we're trying to explain it to them as the lyrics are going and it was just
like um it didn't like my mom's there like you know like it's like it's didn't didn't come across very
well but i was like no it's good everyone's like no no it's like sato it's really good so yeah um it'd
be interesting to have mr girl on one time um so um i've got a i've got a last couple of questions
and if anyone's got um any questions um others will wrap up so you can get to your show
but um i i ask these questions to um to everyone so you don't believe in a god right
i don't do you okay um what if anything would change your mind
uh i mean like concrete evidence that's been like tested or something like that like
like scientific testing maybe that there's a god or there's like a high indicator that
there might be a god or something like that so yeah okay um what is the most plausibly true
religion that you don't believe in so you used to be an ex-muslim so but maybe that you won't
choose that so what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in
i don't know that i've studied enough religions to really know the answer to that question um i think
like like whether there's a god or not honestly is irrelevant to me even if there was a god would
it really matter to me you know like is it really affecting my life right now so i don't know enough
about religions to say which one is the most true um i think there are uh little bits of wisdom in
all of these religions but uh yeah i'm not really sure about you know yeah which one's the most true
yeah well you should bring me on one time and i'll just like i'll just like dump like you know
10 holy texts worth of information on you i'd be like okay the dama part of the buggy buggy
just says x1c like that's my that's what i do i just what's your opinion
uh damn um most plausibly true religion i don't believe in
it's hard because like i don't it's it's a this is a great question start us thank you for asking
um brilliant genius who ever thought of that you came up with it i thought you might have an
answer to it no um i i don't know i think um i definitely like resonate with um when i read the
the bug buggy buggy it's uh i was it's a hindu text i read that and i there were some parts in that
that i found interesting and i liked the idea that some people say that um that like the story of
like arjuna and krishna behind a big battle is just symbolic for like what's happening in someone's
brain so if i could believe in a type of like hinduism um slash eastern religion that doesn't
believe in the actual gods and things like that but believed in like um as these things as expressions
of like emotional feelings verse and um and uh and like um how our brains work in our psychology
then i could maybe get on board with that but if you're gonna push me and like really like
drive home like what religious is most likely true i'd say probably buddhism um just because
buddhism doesn't have necessarily a god and they believe just in like karma and reincarnation um
and that just i guess is the most fun to me i guess that's the only way i can i mean i mean
they you know the the existence of gods is irrelevant in buddhism too right like like
basically in buddhism like there could be gods there maybe even are gods because it like it is
branched off of hinduism but um but like one of the stories is that like um uh like one of these
people who reached enlightenment uh was so enlightened that all these gods were shooting
arrows at him and they didn't go to him um basically yeah yeah and so um i don't remember the exact
story but this clay they're saying like the gods are irrelevant whether there's a god or not it's
irrelevant and i kind of agree with that sentiment so yeah so what do you think happens um when we
die i'm giving you like grade two level philosophy of religion questions what happens when we die
when we die um so scary uh i don't know i don't think anything happens i think we
go to sleep for the last time yeah that's the same i believe that um we go to the same place
that a flame go goes when you blow out a candle uh and um the last question um is if you could
choose an afterlife they're all religious space sorry if you could choose an afterlife and it
would be instantly and it would instantly become true which afterlife would you choose
so that includes like and it has to be from like an actual religion so like reincarnation
islam's heaven christianity's heaven um what sounds the most fun
i think reincarnation sounds sounds good but i don't like the idea of reincarnation based on like
karma i think it should just be random like reincarnation that's completely random and um
and you know the beauty of life is living it right and so reincarnation sounds based because
you're just experiencing life from the beginning again right so yeah yeah true true oh thank you
so much everyone if you like what stardust has had to say and you want to hear her in some spicy
debates um which is fantastic and make sure you go check out her youtube channel youtube.com

also link your your um links in my chat as well um and also i wanted to clarify somebody sent a
super chat to clarify that thing about the ua the nazi scientists um yeah they said the argument is
more that personal views and speech that drove choices and actions can have an unknown effect
trying to predict the outcomes of someone's speech can do more damage than good
so i guess that makes sense that you know that predicting the outcomes of somebody's speech may
not um oh yeah we don't really know yeah so you don't really yeah that's true that's true yeah that's
