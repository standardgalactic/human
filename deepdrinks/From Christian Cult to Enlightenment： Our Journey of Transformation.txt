And I know that so many, even Christians today,
they will immediately not take what we have to say
that seriously because of our fundamentalist background.
Like, oh, you were in that crazy Christian cult.
Like you were in the wrong side.
You were in the weird side.
Like, obviously the earth isn't, you know,
that young and things of this nature.
And it's embarrassing to say how, you know, 2016, man,
you were well into your 20s.
It's embarrassing to be like, oh yeah,
we really believe this, but we had no reason not to
and every reason to believe it from our background
and our upbringing and our, again, our influences.
