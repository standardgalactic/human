You know, some people flip that switch quickly.
It's amazing when I hear those stories.
They're like, well, I was a devout believer
and then I encountered this and within two days
I knew it was crap.
I was not that guy.
I think my journey began, actually it kind of began
when my best friend had come out to me as gay.
It was in the mid 1990s and of course I'd been trained
to feel like gay people were going to hell.
I made fun of gay people.
I was a toxic person about this thing
and he wrote me a letter and he was just like,
you don't know this about, he hit it very well.
But he said, you know, I'm gay and you need to know.
And I think that is the first time I can really remember
deciding I'm going to cut this out of the Bible in my brain.
I'm going to take these anti-gay verses.
Okay.
