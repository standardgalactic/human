It's important that we don't say, okay, snapshot,
here's a set of laws that, you know,
that Hammurabi put down.
Well, this is what we should be living by.
And let's just go line by line
and re-institute all this stuff, you know,
horrible patriarchy and everything, like, no.
And I don't think we should do that
with the middle Assyrian laws.
I don't think we should do that with Neo Babylonian laws.
I don't think we should do that
with the laws of the Hebrew Bible.
But like, think about what Judaism has done.
They've worked with the text
and they thought about it in relation
to their time and their culture.
And they've said, let's wrestle with this.
Let's debate about it.
Let's think about it.
How can it apply here?
And I think that's a beautiful thing.
And so anyway, I just, the danger is
when you drive your stake in the ground
and you say my interpretation based on this ancient text,
we have to live just this way
according to my very fundamentalist,
literalist interpretation.
And so do you.
