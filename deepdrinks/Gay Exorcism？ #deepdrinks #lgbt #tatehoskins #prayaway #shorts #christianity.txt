So I went to my school counselor
because I really didn't have anyone else to turn to.
I got home that day, my mom was in the kitchen.
She didn't even look at me, she was just so cold.
She just said, like, get your stuff and get in the car.
Became very clear that we were going to a church
and I remember seeing my pastor looking out
into the parking lot as my mom and I kind of pulled up.
We sat down.
You know, son, your mother told me about,
is it makeup to school?
You're wearing makeup.
I remember him saying that, you know,
being gay is an abomination
and that we're the only creature
that participates in that behavior.
We're not.
I said, there's plenty of species
that practice homosexual interactions.
He reached in and he got a little bottle of polio
and he put his hand on my forehead
and he did like a cross.
Mom put her hand on my shoulder
and then he started preaching
and then it slowly progressed more
and my mom was crying more
and she started speaking in tongue
and screaming this preaching rhetoric at me
and my mom was sobbing basically on the floor
at that point.
Shout out, brother Jeff, if you're listening to this.
I to this day have so much hate in my heart for you, buddy.
