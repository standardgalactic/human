Welcome to Deep Drinks Podcast,

Welcome everyone to Deep Drinks Podcast.
Today we have an awesome
episode with someone who I've actually
had requested from one of my good friends.
His name is Tate Hoskins,
and we're going to be learning about his
story, his journey,
finding out, like, discovering that he was gay
in his early
teen years, talking about it to a counselor,
and then getting brought to
have an exorcism.
We'll learn a lot about that before we get started.
I want to quickly mention, as always,
that we are
trying really hard to get to 1,000 subscribers.
When we get to 1,000 subscribers, we are going to be doing
a charity stream. So if you like content like
this, if you like conversations around
religion, philosophy, science, sociology, life,
then
join up and
subscribe. So we have a couple of
interesting streams coming up. We have
an interview with Oz
again, and he's going to be releasing his album
Devil's Night, which is going to be good.
And then we have a conversation, a new way
to have hard conversations with
Reed Niswanda, and that'll be a conversation
about street epistemology.
So that's going to be a really interesting one.
We also have a few that aren't mentioned
here. We have Biddy Butter coming on soon
to talk about how she
is an atheist who still does tarot cards
and things like that. She's really into that kind
of spiritual stuff, but she doesn't necessarily
believe it's true. She just kind of enjoys it.
And then we also
have Niddy, Nidimus coming on,
which is going to be awesome. He's going to be talking about cults
because he was in one, he believes.
Also, if you like podcasts,
if you want to listen to this podcast on the way to work,
we have links here to
all the podcasts. If you just go do the links
in the description, pod follow

Apple podcasts,
Spotify and everything.
And of course, this episode will be there
very shortly.
So with that said,
I want to, we don't have a lot of time with Tate.
He's a busy man. He's got, he's got some
clothing line possibly coming up. We might learn about that
today. And I want to, but I want
to just jump straight into this interview.
So Tate Hoskins
is a Tiktoker
an LGBT advocate who went through an exorcism
when his mom found out that he was gay.
Tate has
drumroll 1.3 million
followers on Tiktok
and lots of followers in
on Twitch. And it's just,
I think he might, he might be the most popular guest
that we've ever had on Deep Drinks. So with that
said, I'd like to welcome the amazing,
the awesome, the handsome, the beautiful man
Tate Hoskins.
Howdy!
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
Thank you so much for coming on. This is
this is amazing and
it's always nice to talk to a nice
Southern boy who has manners
and it's good.
Yeah.
Lots of men.
So we, we're drinking,
what are we drinking today? You've got a specific drink.
Yeah. So normally I'm a white
claw kind of guy. I typically, I go for
you know, some of the little seltzer.
But today I have this, it's
top of Chico. I don't know if this is
a good brand or not, but
I found it. It's pineapple and I'm ready to
ready to drink a little bit.
Oh, awesome. I've got
the white claw, the pineapple version
as well. I love it.
And yeah, this is good.
I've never had one of these before. I only had one
for the first on the other day.
And so, yeah, it's cool.
What's your go-to drink?
Well, normally I'm not very
much of a social drinker. So normally when
I drink, it's at home with a bottle of
Scotch playing video games by myself.
So I like Scotch.
I like, I like beer,
but mainly Scotch, depending on
how things are.
What about Bourbon?
Oh, I like Bourbon. Bourbon's okay.
I've had a guest introduce me to Bourbon, actually,
Dr. Josh
who's a
a seriologist. He came on and he wanted to
drink on Bourbon. And that was good.
It was Woodford Reserve
is what we had. Nice.
Kentucky is the home of Bourbon, so
I always like to ask people their thoughts on it.
Yeah, so you're from
are you in Kentucky now?
Yeah, yeah, born and raised. Very small
town, very, very small town, my entire
life. So I figured I would just stick it
out here until I can, you know,
until I move on.
Awesome. So what's everyone else
drinking? I see someone, Nanaloo, you have
a hot chocolate. That's really cool.
We have a P. Barnes
who's an Australian. 11 a.m. beer,
that's the way that's what we do in Australia.
I always say it's
socially acceptable
for Australians to drink. It's
10 a.m. That's anywhere I get away with this show.
But
I really did
want to get into your story because
I'll link to
later on, I'll link to your
TikTok, but you went through a tremendous
experience. Can you tell us
a little bit first of all about growing up
gay
in the South? Yeah, it's
weird because
it's your lived experience. It's hard to know
how it is different from other folks
and I think
for me, I always knew I was
gay in school, but
gay was a very
unspoken thing down here where I live.
If you were gay,
nobody talked about it. Nobody asked you
if you were
an effeminate boy or
maybe a girl that had more
tomboyish actions
and everything. We just sort of
kept quiet on it.
It's like a don't ask, don't tell kind of thing.
So as I got older
I realized
more and more that this is an identity
that I have and that I wasn't
talking about with anybody.
Being
in the Bible bell of the South
it's even more pressure.
It wasn't
a pleasant experience. A lot of it was
just a very unspoken experience
until it wasn't.
Did you try to hide it
or anything like that?
Did you have a phase where you were trying to
pray the gay away or
I guess
did it go
straight or something?
I think a lot of folks do have that
experience. I did not.
I was the kid
that was wearing
this hat.
It looked like a big frilly
scarf. I was
a kid that was very proud to be
different and very proud to wear things
that were
indicative of who I was.
So it wasn't like I was
ever trying to put on a front.
I think naturally
I've never really opened up about it
to anybody, any friends or anything
until I was a little older and kind of understood
what it was and what that meant for me.
But no,
I didn't have the experience of
trying to
suppress those feelings and those thoughts
even though that's a super common thing here
for me. I don't know what it was.
I guess I just was too
stuck in my ways.
That's
awesome.
So
there's so many different
questions and so many different avenues I have
but in what age
did you start realizing
that you like boys instead of girls?
Or do you like girls?
Are you bi or are you gay?
No, I tell folks that
I think
most of
I personally believe in the spectrum
where everyone's
a little bit or a little bit this way.
And for me, I think women are beautiful and everything
but I would say if someone were to ask me
are you gay or bi, I would just say I'm gay
to keep things as simple as I can
for myself.
But
what was the question?
Well I guess
I'm a little bit the same myself. I haven't had any food today
so it's 10.
I'm already feeling this is funny but
let's say on the spectrum, where are you
on that spectrum?
Are you right to the
99% you just almost
pretty much as gay as you can be
or are you like
I would say I would put my sexuality
somewhere like 95%
95% for sure gay
and maybe 5%
I could entertain
the idea.
I feel like
being perfectly bi
you'd have the best of both worlds
the world is your oyster
you've got a smorgasbord of choice
Listen, I love our bi kings
and queens and
they-bims out there, I love them
sometimes I'm like man I wish
I could just
flip the switch
but I'm gay
I always say
I've said it a few times on this podcast
my wife and I are just going through IVF
and I always say if our child ended up being
straight I'd still love them anyway
I've gone so far
I just
seeing what my friend went through
and everything I had to go through
being gay and growing up in Australia
in the 70s and 80s for him
it was so hard
and I think the more that we can do to accept
LGBT people
it's weird that
we don't in a lot of ways
but luckily I think that it's getting
better
at least it is in Australia anyway
yeah it is
the climate of being gay and being a queer
youth is changing
and I think it's still far from perfect
but it takes folks like
you and I to have a platform
that we give a voice to
those people I think that's a really
important part of
the coming out experience for our youth now
so I want to say thank you
as a straight man who is
giving your platform
up to another creator who is LGBT
I think that's a really
admirable thing and I think we should value that
a lot more
thank you I appreciate it
we talked about this before we went on
but like it was seeing my friend's
experience who was closeted for 45 years
he was the first guest
on Deep Drinks Podcast to see him
and what he went through
talking about his belief, his Christian
beliefs, I met him in ministry college believe it or not
when I was starting to be a youth pastor
and for him to be so conflicted
about his beliefs and the way
the church treated him when he did decide to
eventually come out it was
just shocking to say the
least
have you noticed too this is just a random
aside and it's already happening the random
drunken aside is coming have you noticed that
a lot of time
Christians will
a lot of Christian friends but
they will think that somehow like gay
marriage and stuff is persecution on them
like somehow like
they're being persecuted by
like equal rights and
things like that it's a weird thing that I've noticed
yeah it is a really
weird and a really common thing that I think
that a people and I'm gonna
say you know I think in all fairness
I do think it is a
it is an issue for people on the left and
people and people on the right I think it's an issue for
people who are Christian people who are
atheist or non-religious I think
the issue really just sort of
it lands on
the way that we perceive the world and
when we feel like
something that
when we feel like our beliefs are the way that we live
our lives is like being attacked
it's like we want to
twist that into this really weird persecution
complex and it's
weird but it is very
common and it's unfortunate I
really really hate seeing
you know my Christian friends and family
say things like oh I love
you I love you I just
don't love your ways it's like
do you love me are you sure you love me
or do you love the idea
imagine if you said love the religious
hate the religion like they'd be like oh
yeah yeah that's like
it's so insulting that it really
truly is yeah because it's
so tied to their identity right but
I guess with um I guess we've
been gay is you know religion is
a choice but being gay essentially isn't a choice
right it's like a mutable characteristic so it's
like it's I would say it's equally
it's way more offensive I would say to
um to say that I would
agree with that that is a really great way of putting
it I absolutely agree yeah
what so eventually
though like when when you you decided
to go to a school counselor can you
tell us a little bit about that oh yeah
so here's the story starts getting good and there's a
lot of details that I've not really shared on
mine so this is a lot of this will be
stuff that folks who've probably
seen or heard this story before
will won't know going
into this so I
had a girlfriend at the time
her name is Taylor and we've
talked about you know me sharing our experience
and everything she is awesome now she's
an incredible young woman
and she is she's doing a lot of really
awesome things out there so shout out to you Taylor
but
you know we were in a we were in a little
little relationship you know in the
school relationship puppy love type
thing and
I think through
her I really understood what my
sexuality was you know I think dating
a girl really showed me everything
that I didn't want
and I say that as you know with as much love as I
can
and so when I started realizing that like
okay I'm I am not
straight I'm not into girls and
I and I don't like girls
because before that it was a matter of okay I
know I like boys but
you know do I do I like girls can I like
girls and and that experience
this experience was was one
of those things that really solidified
that for me so when I when I understood
okay you are not straight
like you do not like girls and this is
just how it is I started
exploring a lot more
of the identity that I
have sort of buried away before that so
I was watching a lot of youtubers at
the time I don't know if you're
really familiar with like the YouTube scene
back in like 2010 or 12 I guess
at this point yeah
like Philip DeFranco like and like Smosh
and old yeah old
YouTube there was a YouTuber
who who has since transitioned
into the beautiful Gigi gorgeous
I'm sure that most of my followers know who
that is but Gigi at the
time had a YouTube channel and
she had not transitioned yet
and so she had still
been under the
format of being a
gay boy that wears makeup
and and I really resonated with
Gigi during those
during that time in that era because
I felt like this was a
a thing that I wanted to do you know this
was really before this was before
the yes this is Gigi gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous woman stunning
absolutely stunning
and this was really before the
this was before like the you know the James
Charles and Manny Mua and Jeffrey
star era where I mean
never not important
this was before this was before
wearing makeup as a you know
boy beauty influencer was
was a thing and so I
I started wearing makeup to school
and that was
when it really started
to hit the fan so the
breakup happened I was like okay
you know what now I don't have to pretend anymore
I'm just gonna start doing this so
I would sneak into my mom's
dresser and she had her
her little makeup bag and I would take her
makeup out and I would put it on before school
and she never really
noticed
and then when she started noticing she would
tell me to take it off she would tell me
to like you know I can't wear that
in public and da da da
was it like
were you just putting on like a little bit of foundation
or were you like putting on like the full like drag
kind of makeup or like big
I don't know the terminology very well sorry but like
no that's that's perfectly perfectly
put so I would wear I would wear like foundation
I had a really bad skin and really bad acne
as a young young
and so I would wear foundation and I would cover
it up and then sometimes I would go even a
step further and I would wear like
eyeliner or like mascara
and lip gloss even sometimes
and so this
kind of this perfect storm started happening where
I was I'd broken up with
my girlfriend and of course
when you're in school and you have a breakup it's like
drama and the kids are wanting to you know
yeah yeah they're like wow he's really taking it hard
yeah
there was there was this like this
click thing that was happening so
you know Taylor had this like group of
people that were kind of bullying me and then I was wearing
makeup to school and so the bullying kind of got
even worse and then my
mom kind of found out and so she was
kind of like on like the bullying
the bullying side of things
and I say that in such a
it's such a unique way of bullying it
I don't know you get it if you have a parent
that's expressed their
this concern for you it feels like
bullying
so I went to my school I didn't know I had anyone
else really to turn to I at the time I wasn't
I was in the church but I wasn't
like clamoring to
go back every Sunday you know I was
going to appease my mom
but it wasn't like I was going to Sunday
school and being like I really need to take some
notes like I need to start writing this down
I was just going to go
and yeah and so I
went to my school counselor because I really didn't have anyone else to turn to
and at that point I had
kind of
I kind of established a relationship with her
where you know I felt like I could kind of tell
her anything and I hadn't came out to her
but I was going to her for like some of
the bullying and and finally
you know I told her like I have
something to tell you but I absolutely
have to know that you're not going to tell my mom
because she is
my mom is the daughter
of a Southern Baptist
slash Pentecostal
preacher so like
for those who don't know who don't know what Pentecostal
or Southern Baptist is they're kind of close
into nomination but there's a lot of things
that Pentecostal folks do that are
a little bit more
obscure
so I say Southern Baptist
Pentecostal for the people who like don't really know
what Pentecostal is
I was a Pentecostal youth pastor so I know
oh wow so you definitely
spoken tongue
sleight of hands all that
that's exactly what it is
so my mom being super religious
I told my counselor
you can't tell her
like you cannot tell her
and my
counselor said
your secret is safe with me basically
and
I told her that I was
my counselor
and that I was wearing makeup to school
and I was getting bullied for it
and it was really hard for me to deal
with that and you know
I've had people say to me well did you say anything
about harming yourself because she has to report that
and did you say anything about like you have
plans to hurt anybody and I'll be
completely honest I definitely did not
I did not tell her that I was going to hurt myself
or that I was self-harming or anything along those lines
it was literally just me getting it off
my chest and coming out to an adult
and
sure enough I went home that
you know I felt great leaving the counselor's office
I was like my secret's out
you know I feel like I'm a new man
I can live this life and I feel like I was so supported
during that and then I got home that day
and she said that my mom was
in the kitchen and she was making
spaghetti I literally remember it so well
and I remember just walking into the kitchen
and she was just
she didn't even look at me she was just so cold
like standing there like stirring the pot
and she just said like
get your stuff and get in the car
and I was like
okay
and I did
I knew immediately
what had happened
but I didn't know how it happened
you know I didn't know what
specifics occurred but
yeah that was
that was a very like
moment of like pure
panic
and also maybe relief
in its own really strange way
it was like my mom knows now
so I don't have to tell her anymore
you know it's out
but definitely panic was
a good part of that
that's um
first of all like
what the fuck was that counselor like
that's some breach of like
yeah that's why do you think they did that
why do you think they told your
mom
since I've shared that story
with so many people and so many people I've kind of seen it
I've had a lot of folks
you know I've had a lot of people say to me
why didn't you sue them or why didn't you do this
and I found out since then
that you know schools in the way that they
regulate their counselors
is so different
than the way that like a medical
like you know a therapist
releases information basically
for anyone out there that's listening that has
maybe a child in school
or
currently in school I don't know if there's a
young audience listening to this but
just know that
school counselors do have and reserve the rights
to disclose every bit of information
that you
that you tell them as a student
legally they can give that information
to any of the school faculty
they can give it to your parents they can give it to
anyone I mean it is
there's literally zero confidentiality from what
I understand about the way that the American
you know laws work
they have free reign
and I think she
I think she told my mom
because
being in a small town and being religious
there's kind of this
code of honor that you follow as a
religious person or as a Christian I'm just going to say as a Christian
because I don't think this falls under religion
I think this falls under like the Southern Baptist religion
and that's you know
if your child
or if you know of anyone that
you know is doing something
that will come back to look bad
on the family you kind of like tell them
out of this weird code of honor even
if that's like a super private thing or a
super you know a super confidential
thing and I think she just
did it out of the
that weird Christian code of honor
because she was she was a religious lady I remember
having even in public school you know
she had like Bible quotes on
her on her little desk and I remember her having
you know all of this like sort of like
cross iconography
and everything so yeah it was
it was it for her
I think it was just a code of like a code of honor
for her to tell my mom you know that what her son
was doing and what kind of shame
I guess I could have brought to my mom's family
you know whatever
was left of it at that point
so
so yeah wow
so where is your mom
where is your mom taking you
so I get in the car
I at that point I just
remember feeling
so much anxiety and so much like
okay what do I do
what do I say what do I do and I remember
asking her several times you know what what's
happening can you please just tell me what's going on
what's going on she wouldn't say anything
I mean it was like total silence
and once I once we got
a little bit into the drive
you know at that point
I kind of thought okay maybe she's taking me to my
aunt's house maybe she's taking me to like
you know to to a restaurant
or something because she needs to talk to me I don't you know
it just didn't make sense and then finally
we got to a certain point where
it became very clear that we were going
to a church and
the way that the church is located in our town like
you kind of have to go a specific way a specific
route I remember getting to that point and being like
okay you know this
this is where we're going we're going to church
and once my mom knew that
like okay he knows that we're going to church
she started telling me
your school counselor called me today
um and I said
you know what did she say
and mom told me basically that
she told her that I was gay
um
and I said I'm not gay I'm bi
there's a difference mother
you didn't tell her it was 955
you just told her I'm bi
um and
and she and she said
you know I
think I don't even remember what she said I'd like it's just
kind of blurred in my mind
because once I knew
that she knew it's like it just happened
it's like that panic hit again
it's like there's so many stages of panic
over the course of that afternoon
um and so finally
we got to the church and I was thinking to myself okay there's
you know there's no one here
um and I see my
pastor
so like the way that the church is set up there's this little
excuse me this little office building
to the side I remember seeing my pastor
standing at the door with the door
open looking out into the parking lot
as my mom and I kind of pulled up
um and thinking okay
so we're going to meet with
uh is it okay
if I say just his first name because that's
what that's what I'm doing yeah yeah you can
yeah you can say yeah you can say his full name
you can say his address if you want to
brother brother Jeff
shout out brother Jeff if you're listening to this
I to this day have so much hate in my
heart for you buddy
yeah
brother Jeff was standing in the doorway
and he was I just remember him kind of
standing there just looking
you know looking at me as I was
like pulling up to the we were getting at
the parking space and then I got out and
mom walked up he invited us
inside we sat down and that's when he
kind of started in
on the the sort of the
the conversation and that was
that was where it started getting really interesting
wow
um
fucking brother Jeff
yeah
I can't I can't
I saw him the other day I think at the
at the gym and I just
know you know I don't think he
recognized me or remembers me because I'm sure
you know he he was a Patrick that with so many
people but I remember
I remember seeing him and just
those feelings of being a kid to start
flooding back in and it was real
it it it must be
like so traumatic to
you know to have that moment
of like hey I'm out on me
like you know this is great great
day and then the people you
love the most like your mother
and then you're brought to church you just told
this is bad
it must be such a conflicting feeling
it it was and
I think the thing that really
you know kind of hurt
um
so just to get into the conversation
a little bit so what brother Jeff started
talking to me about so we sat down
um and my mom was to the left
of me kind of on this like side couch
and then I was sitting on it's
sort of like in the desk situation where I was
sitting at the front of the desk and he was sitting behind his desk
and
he just started kind of
doing that weird gentle parenting thing where
he's like you know son
your mother told me about
about you know you were wearing
is it makeup to school you're wearing makeup
and I and I I remember
him kind of saying it with this like
weird like disgust of like
you know is this is this am I hearing
it right and I said
I said I wear you know I wear makeup
to cover up my acne yeah because I at
that point I'm not going to tell him like hey you know
I'm I want to be in a full
face of like beat down makeup like
I just covering my tracks
and he was like he was like he was
like what why what why would you do
you know God doesn't
want you wearing makeup you're a boy
you you don't and I and
it it was to be fair he doesn't
want women to wear makeup either it's
cool you know
yeah they get they get ignore that
um it was this
really weird thing though where
I was really feeling this
fight internal
this internal fight in me where I was
trying to
be the kind of like
lie my way out of it and just kind
of play into what he was saying and say
you know I agree or you know
that's that's not it's not true or
I was like kind of lying about all this stuff
and then there was this other part of me that was like
I can cut
yeah I can cuss on here right of course yeah I was
like that's why bitch if you
don't if you don't tell this mother fucker
to go fuck himself three ways
sideways I like if you don't
tell him what is on your mind you're gonna
regret this and so I remember
hearing him and him telling me
oh I specifically remember him saying
when we got more past
makeup and we're kind of talking about being gay
and being bi and blah blah blah I remember
him saying that you know being gay is
an abomination and that we're the only
creature that participates
in that behavior and I remember
true I remember arguing with him
and I think that was the point for me
when I when he said that
and at this point in my life I want to
I want to say that I had started listening to
the atheist experience
I don't know if you're
the spirits of
mental Humpty got you like
you know what I gotta give
a little shout out to him as well because he
is a huge part of me sort of
understanding some of the some of those
those flaws and those those
loopholes and things like that in the
religion that was being preached on me so I remember
I remember him saying that about
you know we're the only species and I at that
point
I said I snapped and I said
no we're not
we're not I said there's there's plenty of species
that practice
you know homosexual
interactions like and of course
that's a problem Tate is you
you were you were coming out in with facts and logic
and that that just like that
the world view crumbles under that you can't do that
you can't present facts and logic in
a conversation like that you
I I definitely
I definitely felt that way because when I
said that to him I just remember him being so
you know so combative and so
no no that's not right that's not true
excuse me and so
so I remember that was kind of when
that when the switch flipped and
at that point I was like you know what
these gloves
they're coming off and I'm about to lay
under the sky and I just remember being
like at the end of the day
I like I am who I am and
nothing that you say or that you say that God
feels like I'm an abomination or whatever the case is
is going to change that about me and
my mom can sit here and
and and cry and sob
and blah blah blah but it's not going to
it's not going to change my life and it's not going to change the person
that I am and I know who I am at this point
and I just I don't even
remember everything I said but I should remember
the feeling just it was like
waves of of emotions
coming out and I remember saying to him
in that moment
so
the way you're treating me is so
ungodly I don't know what
possessed me at the time but I told him
I was like the way you're treating me is so ungodly
and and of course
he didn't like me saying that and I just remember
it being you know more and more and then
eventually
after enough back and forth
I can't remember if we were there like
15 minutes or 45 minutes
it's just a blur
but after enough back and forth
he finally
he finally got up
he I remember he
had like a Bible in one hand
and he had a drawer
under his desk and he pulled out this drawer
as he stood up he reached in and he got
a little bottle of of holy oil
which I'm sure you're familiar with
I'm trying to find like a little comparison
for the viewers it was probably
this is a little one thing it was probably
the size of this one right here like
and
he popped the top off of it and he
put some on his hand and he walked over to me
and I was I was sitting there you know just
mad and everything
and he and he put his
hand on my forehead and he did like a cross
that would have been great for your acne
it
yeah that's probably what broke me out
you like dick
you want foundation
I'm gonna have to put on now
that's really funny so
he put his hand on my shoulder afterwards
and mom stood up
and she was
she was like crying and
she held his hand and mom
put her hand on my shoulder and then he started
preaching and like sort of
praying over me
out loud and it started off
I just remember it started off as you know
oh lord you know please touch this young man's
heart and show him the way
the light of your love and all this
and then it slowly progressed more
and my mom was crying more and he started
speaking in tongues and for any viewers
out there who don't know what that is it's basically
where a preacher or
even I think the congregation
gets touched by the Holy Spirit
and what is going on do you see that
that's an orb it's a little hair
I swear
um so
he started speaking in tongues and it's like
you know speaking a different language it's like a biblical
language and it was
at that point I was just sitting there
like
you know not really defeated but very resolved
in
how this experience made me
feel and
after it was done and he had
you know started speaking in tongue and
screaming you know screaming
this this this preaching rhetoric
at me um and my mom was sobbing basically
on the floor at that point I just remember
you know mom thanked him and we were
leaving and we got in the car
and I buckled up
and I was sitting there
in silence
and I said
to my mom I said
I will never forgive you for this
I will hate you for the rest of my life for this
and at that
point I was so
I was so serious about that because
I had never felt so betrayed
by my mom
you know
how old were you at this time if you're a mommy asking
God I must have been
I would say maybe at most
14 13 14 somewhere
in that ballpark there's so many
ways that your trust was
like
you know you had you essentially had
you essentially had
what would have felt like your counselor
betray your trust your mom betray your trust and then
God or like the church figure
betray your trust right yeah yeah
it feels
yeah I guess that I guess they were
maybe expecting that you'd fall on the ground and like
slither around in the spirit of
Matt DeLahunty and demons would come out of you
and you'd be straight and then you'd start like
start wearing like plaid shirts and like
you know pick it up in the bars
like it just seems
it seems um
it seems like that's what they were trying to go for
uh yeah
that's um it's funny how
like not to
talk about me too much but like it's funny how like
they think that that's like a like a lot of
times christians think that that's like a
thing like I've been on in debates on tiktok
well I think I was bringing up making up making too much
sense and it bothered them so much that they
called in this like person who came
on and just started this preaching and
and prophesying and and praying
over me and they got annoyed
that I wasn't listening so then I sat there
for 15 minutes as this guy was like
the bearer of God come down
to David and I'm just like watching this is on tiktok
and I'm just like like watching just like
okay like and then like at the end they
were upset that I didn't have this like
huge like powerful like demon
like alien thing come out of my
mouth like it's it's like
it's so awkward at the end you kind of like
okay like can I go now
like it's very strange
um it is it's a very strange
culture and it's a strange you know and I
I don't I don't
take pride or I don't
set set out to
to criticize
you know my my christian viewers
my christian fans or family or friends even
for that matter yeah I think
one thing that happens is that when I
start sharing my experience with people
there's this discomfort that happens
because they feel like I'm
you know I'm I'm blaming them or I'm
blaming you know their
belief and it's not that
it's that I'm I'm you know I'm just telling
them who is responsible for the things that happen
to me and and I think that's a really a comfortable
thing for a lot of people who do identify
and align with that christian sort of
ideology have they struggle with
that I think
yeah and there's some like
you know one of my
you know Megan Lewis um Dr. Josh's wife
she's um she's a christian but she's like
she's cool like she's queer
as well she's a christian like but
she's um but she doesn't accept like the bible
as an errant and things like that
because she's a seriologist so she knows the
the history but um
you know not all christians are like that and I think
that in some way a lot of these people even
even um that piece of shit
brother Jeff is probably a victim of his
circumstances in regards to he's probably
taught that when he grew up and stuff it's
um uh like we said before
hate love the religious hate the religion
i just do
yeah I mean it's hard because
sometimes I do I I hate it but I do
feel that way because
I I just have had so many
traumatic experiences with it and it's
to a point where it's like how many times
can you forgive you know a note or
an idea how many times can you forgive
people that claim that this is a great
thing and then as hurt me time and time
again um yeah but
you know it's it's just because
how life is yeah
so uh so we only
got a little bit of time left so I want to
kind of jump into some questions if um
we have some questions from cute people have
some questions just at um deep drinks
podcast in the questions and we can get
to them but I have a few questions myself
um
the first question is what was it like when you finally
decided to leave your authentic self like after
that did you just do you just double
down on the um
gay event now or like what did you
do
do you have like what was it like when you finally
decided you know what I'm just going to
be gay I'm going to have as much fun
as I want I'm going to you know go for
relationships like what was it like
yeah you know I think for me
it was it was
you know double down I
I really um I
didn't really think about it until just now but after
you know after I after I was
outed to my mom
who was really the only person at the
time that I care you know
with me in school
it wasn't
really a secret once me and
my ex-girlfriend you know my girl from
that time broke up that when I started wearing
makeup that I was gay you know it wasn't like
at that point it was just sort of very
known um and I
didn't care if the teachers knew I didn't care if
the if the students knew I didn't
care you know whoever knew but I did care
that my mom knew and so I kept it kind of
in this bag right I didn't put it on
social media I didn't put it on anywhere
and then when she when
she when I was outed I was like
okay I have nothing left to lose
so I remember I
remember specifically I
went to the mall I want to say
this was like you know maybe a
few weeks to a month later
and I bought this bright pink mac
lip gloss to this day I remember
how it tasted it was the most
chemically like
fake taste of like bubble cup
it was so gross that I just remember walking
around like the lunch room and just putting it
on and being like what now
bitches like yeah
it's not very good
but yeah double down
that's um that's something that um and correct
me if I'm wrong but that's something that like a lot of my
um Christian friends they don't understand pride
right they don't understand like pride month for them a lot
of pride is a sin right even
on Peterson tweeted something out like all that
or Ben Shapiro someone one of those
some conservative peeps
they um and but I think what they don't
understand is there's like a lot of the time
for the LGBT community there's so
you know you guys like you have to like
hide from yourself that when you finally decide to come out
it's like you know what like I'm going to
go to the other I'm gonna like
be proud of who I am I'm not going to hide
and part of that that uh
that action of like you know being your
authentic self and like going to an extreme
actually therapeutic in a way it's um
if there's no such thing as homophobia
even internal homophobia you probably
wouldn't need pride right like pride
parades and stuff because it's just like
you're just happy with like how you are
yeah I uh I I have really
resonate with that and I appreciate you saying that
because I think that that a lot of people who don't
understand what pride is is there for
they don't get that aspect they don't get the
aspect of you know whenever you have to
live a life that you hide
features of who you are
or or parts of who you are
that other people you know
and I'm going to use the word like
normal kids um even though
I definitely don't you know mean it in like an offensive
way I'll say normal kids kids that have a
heteronormative like childhood
um that you know
they get to date girls
and not feel any shame in that they get
to they get to
play sports and not have any shame in
that they get to do all of these things that like
they don't have to feel shame
about their identity
or who they are inherently
as a person you know they may still feel shame
for doing certain things but it's
never going to be because
because they are straight and I think
for me you know I was
feeling so much shame about
all of these things about myself
and and and I think most
people that understand what I'm saying right now
felt that way and
when you get to the point where you don't feel
you're like okay I'm not going to feel shame about this anymore
I'm going to embrace it
you know you do have to
wave a flag to say
this is who I am and this is why
I am this way and
yeah so I definitely think a lot of people
have this really big grudge
against pride and they don't
understand that it's literally
a core part of our
experience as a human being
is feeling shame and we don't want to
do that anymore
exactly
this is this is off the cuff
if you don't want to talk about this just say it
but I have to know and hopefully
you've had enough drinks to
this is a normal question but
when you first started like engaging in sexual
activities with guys did you feel
a sense of guilt or were you just like yes
I'm living my best life
so I am definitely
a little bit of a late bloomer
you know
it's funny because I do sex work
online and I do have
a platform where I really
embrace that like energy about
myself and bring that to the table
but I don't have a very extensive
sexual like history and I think
a lot of people are really shocked by that but
I didn't really have any
boyfriends or like any like
encounters that I think a lot of people do
through their through their younger
years I didn't really date
I had I think like a boyfriend
but it was a very like friendship
type thing and we didn't really
engage in anything so I never
really had the opportunity to
process those feelings and then finally
I got into a
my first real relationship which ended up
being my long term relationship of
seven years and
yeah I never I never felt any shame or guilt
from that because at that point
I had just grown up so much that it
was just I was just who I was
and it wasn't like something that I
any struggles with it that by that
point that I had kind of gotten into that relationship
hmm my wife and I
waited till we're married
to have sex for the first time
and yeah
we're religious well you know
we try to do it right we did we kind of
did other stuff but we never had like
full sex I guess you could say but
but I still feel guilt sometimes when
we have sex and I think that's got to do
with like the purity culture that I was brought up with
in church every every man's
battle the
differentiation between lust and making love
and things like that so it's
it's um it's something I'm still
continuing to work on and we might be doing a panel here
I'm shortly on purity culture
we'll be talking about it with a bunch of peeps and
how that kind of can fuck
people up but um
I've got to stop swearing so much I swear
a lot but it's fine that it's just
I'm swearing a lot uh so
uh have some
questions um how's your
relationship with your mom now
oh that is an awesome question
and I think I see it's from our good friend
Joey much love to you Joey he's a huge
follower and a huge supporter of mine and I just
I want you to know I just love you
um so my relationship with my mom now
is actually really really really good
um she is she has
came leaps and bounds
from that from that time
of ignorance
and and and I want to say that that's a
big part of her
her own growth and I do have
to say you know if you're out
there and you're struggling right now with a parent
or a sibling or a friend
even that doesn't understand you
or isn't accepting you because they have
religious feelings about your lifestyle
um lifestyle
um just know
I have to I have to mention that like
Hailey Brooke who is a tiktoker who
same same same story she
um I would say like she was
out of life like her family rejected her
a lot for being um gay but I
said to her I was like um when do
you choose to gay lifestyle and it's like that was
the joke right like the joke is
it is a lifestyle anyway so keep going
sorry that's a really
really good story um but you know
whenever you um
whenever you have those friends or this family that
that like aren't accepting you
just know that it it's
not a forever thing and it doesn't have to be
a forever thing that people can grow
and people can learn and it and it comes down
to how much they do love you and
care about you um if they're willing
to put those beliefs
you know aside
long enough to hear you out and
um and I
I just want to say that there is hope if my mom
can come around
and and learn to accept and love me and not
only love and accept me back then but
now she is my literally my
biggest fan and she knows about my
platforms online my sex work
that I do and everything and she is such a supporter
and uh if my mom
can do it you know anyone can do it so
just keep keep in there
I uh I was doing research
on you and I mentioned this before but I was doing research
and I was like oh yeah I was like Ted Hoskins and I went
on to your Twitter and I was like oh okay there's a lot
of uh not-for-safe work for you and I was like
but to be fair it looks like you're having a great time
so if you intitate yes you want to see
a bit of naked nakey taty
that's a weird thing um I just said but yeah
go check out his um his Twitter as well
nakey taty I'm gonna have to I'm definitely stealing
that one nakey taty is uh
I apologize
it's all
I love it
what advice would you give
to a younger self
phew
that's a hard one that's a hard one
I would I would tell my younger
self
to
listen
more and stop
listening to respond
I am a big advocate for people
listening to the opinions
of other people and listening to the perspective
of other people even if you don't like
what they're saying or how they're saying it
it's always important
to understand
the bridge
that they are coming from
and I would tell my younger self
you know I know that you are hard-headed
and you are set in your ways
but it's so important that you take a moment
to listen and hear people out
um all everywhere
and uh and you will get a lot
farther in your in your young life
by
actually sitting back and opening your ears
and you know shutting your little mouth
and not talking so much
that's uh that's something I have to
uh
I love to talk and dominate conversations
but I had to um I mean I'm doing it right now
but I'm just like with deep drinks I had to
like shut up let other people talk
let them tell their stories so it's
a constant learning curve for me as well
to try and listen and stuff but
yeah I think a lot of people I think a lot of people
um and myself included in that you know
we we all
struggle with it's sort of that
feeling of wanting to relate to someone
or expand on experience or expand on
a statement and um and so I think
a lot of people do they do listen
a lot of time to to give a response
and I think one of the most powerful tools
that I've got you know been able
to to acquire
as an as an adult is the ability
to sit back and
listen to someone talk and talk
for a very long time and
just listen to what they're saying and
why they're saying it even if I don't agree
with a word I'm just listening and that's important
yeah yeah exactly
uh what advice would you give
to a younger person um who
is having a conflict with their faith
slash culture and sexual identity
yeah that's it's sad because it's so
it's so
it's so common and I
see that a lot in my comments and my messages
from people who say you know I grew
up in a religious family and I feel like now
I'm an outcast I've even
I've even talked to guys romantically
before that have kind of
gone through that um
I would say
that there is a place
in this world for you to
exist exactly as
you are and if
and if to you that
person is someone who loves
and cherishes God in a religion
and also happens to be gay
or bi or trans or
non-binary or whatever the case is
I think you you are
very valid in that
experience and you will
be able to
to find your legs and find your
footing um
in the community that you're in and
and no matter what
do not ever let anybody tell you that
you can't practice your religion
practice your faith love
your God and be loved by your God
because of the person that you were born as
so don't ever let anybody tell you that
and I think a lot of kids
a lot of the youth needs to hear that
when it comes to their religion
such an awesome answer
um you're so genuine
I really appreciate that
thank you
is Nakey Tady going to be the new only
fans handle
that is a very good one
Nakey Tady is a solid
catchphrase I'm going to have to use that
so just uh
I was going to tell you to keep an eye out for it
but I'm going to guess and say you probably won't
any context that will be
used in but I will be stealing it
so we'll see we'll see where we're going
awesome you can be like um yeah it could be
like a cool thing
if anyone if anyone does um
join your only fans or like twitter and stuff
make sure you comment Nakey Tady
who knows where you came from
please
so you have a clothing
brand possibly coming out can you tell us a little bit
about that yeah so
one of the beautiful things that I've been able to do
with my platform is reach out
to a an audience and connect
with an audience that um
I think a lot of the world doesn't
even know exists and I
say that because of how
I really didn't know they
existed until I started this kind of this
this social media journey
and that is folks who were born
whether it be in the south
or you know
even international folks
that grew up in a very blue collar home
or blue collar lifestyle
but never felt like they were
represented by
the culture around
you know the blue collar lifestyle
um where
you know it's sort of this the stigma
of straight white men
in the apparel in the music
in the media it's a lot
of the same and so one thing
that I wanted to do is give my
viewers and give my audience
and people who may not even know who I am
but feel like they've never
been represented by
a blue collar brand or a blue collar
um you know a blue collar
person like myself
um giving them a face
in the apparel industry
and so I created
a brand called stag pride
and we're we're on the start
up of it so there's you know it's a lot
going on I mean just loads
and loads and loads of work um but
every moment of it is awesome because we're
able to create clothes that are
plus size friendly um at
the moment I think we have sizes going up to
triple excel which
to my understanding is is a really
really uncommon size
to see in startup clothing brands
and so I was I'm very proud of that
um
I I I love it
because a lot of a lot of folks say that you know
because of my size or because my body I've never
really I don't really shop for myself
I don't really buy clothes for myself because I don't
really feel comfortable in them and one of the things
that I want this brand to do is is to make
everybody feel represented
and comfortable and sexy and confident and
so whether you are trans
or um a person of color
or or a plus size individual
you have a you have
a place in with me
on my platforms and you have a place
in in all of my projects and all of my
all of my work that I do and this clothing
brand is definitely a reflection of that
so um I'm excited to get it
out there for people
Bronson says uh stag pride
thank you so much I love it I love it
I love it I love it I'll have to get
uh I'll have to get a some
some stuff sent to Australia and buy some stuff
from you because I'm yeah it'll be exciting
I'll have to promote it again
uh someone said uh
I'm so excited um
oh my god I love it
I'm just gonna get naked with Tati so that might be
another like spinoff maybe do like a fan meet
up with people where we all get naked I don't know
uh that that's
that's awesome um so
uh when are you hoping that this will
launch yeah so we're
our goal is to launch by
by June of next year
that's kind of our deadline at the moment and
and the direction we're going we're gonna
hit that and if we don't

someone who you know it's someone send this to your gay
friend send this to your
auntie uh it's uh
this would be a good thing to show them um
it's a good story uh I do have
one more question uh
any more questions I'm more than happy to
answer absolutely you said
that your mom was cool about your adult work
what are your other immediate family members
dad grandparents siblings um my mom was the
only person accepting slash
tolerant of sex work yeah
that's a really good question um so for
me you know my my family
was raised
the same way that my mom was raised
and and I was raised and so a lot
of them do have a lot of religious you know
a lot of religious
ties and connections and so
for them sex work is a very
uh it's a very
unique world I think one
of the important things is that
I
I embrace it and I don't try to hide
it and I don't try to make it to be
something that it's not and I think
that's given my family a little
bit of an easier time to understand
that like okay he's doing this because
it's like something that he feels genuine
in and he's not doing it because
he he feels like he has to
or he feels like it's it's you know some
sort of you know turn in his life
um my my family
has been really receptive to to my
my work that I do and and
you know I just do it with good intentions and
I think that I think they resonate with that
so if anyone out there is is entering
the world of sex work um and you're
you know you're scared that your
brother or your or your
grandparents or whoever won't understand it
you just kind of know the risk factor
well they do they know what sex work is
are they with the times these days because
I think most people most people kind of
understand it at this point only fans is
kind of a it's kind of a a known
thing now yeah it definitely is
um
I've noticed a huge shift into where
for the long time for the longest time
um women weren't seen to have like a
sexuality the longest time like it was
like where I've really appreciated
that women are seen to be
just as deviant as men sometimes
because like something that I noticed
in um purity culture um
is that the women were seen to like always
cover up because you're never going to
you know you're going to make a man stumble
and the man and we were taught like
you're a predator you will rape people if you don't
okay you know it's crazy but it's
true it really yeah it is
true where it's like like I get like
it's offensive and that's it's wrong
but it's like it's also offensive in that like
women can be like sick
twisted like lustful of you know
people as well like why can't they also
anyway so it's cool
to see you know um I mean there's
obviously some issues with um over
indulging in uh in like what I'm viewing
sex work or um you know becoming
addicted to sex and things like that but I think
that it's it's cool to see like a
healthy perspective that people are having where
people are watching porn in relationships
together or people just view it as like
something you you know you might watch
something online and then move on with
your day like it seems to be like a lot
more of a balanced approach that's um
in the ethos at least
at least sort of among my peers yeah I
think I think a big part of that is
is the culture around
normalizing
human sexuality I think we've treated
sexuality as this sort of taboo thing
for so long and I think
with a lot of folks you know we've
kind of grown to understand that like
you know being a sexual
creature on this earth is like
and it's very normal like that's
every everything we see we look
around you everything is always
having sex I mean
literally it's the oldest thing in history
um so
so yeah I think it's
I think it's the culture that we're kind of coming into
and everything and I think it's an awesome
I think it's as long as there's an understanding
of what you're looking at
I think it can be a really awesome thing
for people out there to have an avenue
to explore
yeah exactly
people asked
thoughts on the impact of the midterms
there have been some pretty horrific legislation in the past years from Florida
I'm gonna be totally
you have no idea
here's the thing
I like to be educated
about politics especially the politics that
really you know directly affect
me and my I'm gonna say the word
family but I refer to my platform
where's my subscribers
and people who
support me I like to know
what's happening in the world
until I get
stressed out about it and then I don't
and then I like to not know what's
happening in the world and I like to live ignorantly
but it is it goes back
to that like listening thing I think with politics
a lot of times I just I need to listen
a little bit more because I definitely
stay pretty ignorant about it
yeah I'm the same
like I was hoping you would know more than me
just to finish up a little comment
every time the wind blows the trees are having sex right in front of you
it's disgusting
abominations
with that said we'll end up
here and thank you so much for taking the time
Tate it's been awesome
to learn a little bit more about your story
when you do launch your clothing line you're welcome to come on again
and discuss it
because I'm sure there's lots more we can talk about
but with that said
I'd just like to say thanks again for coming on
is there anything else you want to say to the audience before we wrap up
yeah one last thing
just to tell everybody out there for people who are watching
that came from
my platform so you already kind of know how I
know how I roll
for those who are watching that are fans of David
here
please just know that you are loved in this world
and I know that that is a very
sort of generic
mushy thing to say
and cringy for some people but it is very true
you are loved by somebody out there
and
if you ever
feel like you're alone
you're wrong
sorry but you're wrong
you're not alone
you will always be supported by somebody out there
so if you're not supportive anybody else
come join the family over on tiktok
on instagram twitter whatever
and you'll always have a friend in me
and I'm sure David probably says the same thing to you all
so much love to everybody out there
and thank you all so much for listening
thank you so much and with that
oh cheers to the camera
thank you for coming on Deep Drinks
cheers
you
