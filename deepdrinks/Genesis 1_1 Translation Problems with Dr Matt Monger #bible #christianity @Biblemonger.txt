At the end of the year, one of the last lectures, the teacher said,
oh, now we're going to do something fun.
We're going to sit down and read some Biblical Hebrew
and just show you guys that you know how to read Biblical Hebrew
already, and how fun it is.
And I had already done years of Biblical Hebrew,
so I was like, oh, this is going to be easy.
And the first thing we do is read from Genesis 1.
And then you read, B'reshid Barah Elohim.
And everybody's like, wait, what?
What does it say?
Oh, my, what?
And everybody's in shock because the first word
is B'reshid, which means in a beginning.
It's indefinite.
It's not the definite in the beginning.
And so when you read straightforward,
it says in a beginning.
And everybody's like, wait, what?
There's got to be something wrong.
It's printed wrong.
And the teacher's like, nope.
That's what it says.
It's like it's an indefinite word.
