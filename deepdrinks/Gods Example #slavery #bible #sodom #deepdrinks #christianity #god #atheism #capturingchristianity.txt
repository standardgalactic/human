Would an all-powerful God need to rest on the seventh day?
When I posed this statement on Twitter, it seemed to panic some apologists.
By the way, the Bible doesn't say that God needed to rest on the seventh day.
Correct. God was teaching us to rest and rest in Him.
I know right. It said He rested. He stopped creating. It was good. It was very good.
God doesn't need to rest, ever. He was setting an example for us.
David McDonald needs some serious education. God rested on the seventh day as a divine example.
Is that how it works?
When God flooded the earth, was that an example of how we should act?
Should we lose wild animals on children if they insult a prophet?
Should we murder the infants of nations enslaving God's people?
Should we set fire to cities when we find them immoral?
At hand.
