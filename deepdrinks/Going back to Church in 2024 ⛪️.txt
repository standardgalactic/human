I want to renounce a generational curse.
My child is autistic.
I break every generational curse off of you.
That thing is born to come when the sky is cracked
and Jesus Christ comes.
The solution for the homosexual here in the New Testament,
they are worthy of death.
They should be lined up against the wall
and shot in the back of the head.
That's what God teaches.
I live in the biggest house in the state of Louisiana.
The biggest house of any preacher in America.
I've seen thousands of people's virginity restored.
I have hundreds of emails about girls' hymns being restored.
We got first and last names of six witches that are in our church.
We ain't afraid of you, you stinking witch.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
I'm afraid of you.
