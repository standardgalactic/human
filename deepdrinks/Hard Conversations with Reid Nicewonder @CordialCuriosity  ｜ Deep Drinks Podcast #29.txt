in parks and universities, inviting anyone to have a quick conversation about anything they would like,
usually an exploration of their beliefs.
I've been hassling Read with questions every few months since October 2017,
after first being introduced to one of Read's street epistemology clips
that was shown on an episode of the atheist experience.
Today we're going to be learning about Read's journey, street epistemology,
and why Read is so passionate about it.
So that said, welcome Read, nice to meet you.
All right, you did quite a bit, thanks.
Well, this is a bit of a new one for us because we're going to be mixing drinks.
We've mixed drinks once before, but we've never done it to such high production value.
So first of all, what are we drinking?
We're drinking in old fashioned.
Cool.
And I guess let's get started.
Read set up a whole drink section.
He's got a drink cam and a cam, another...
Yeah, let me get over there, turn the cornering on.
Yeah, let's mix up these old fashioned.
Hey, how's everyone doing?
Hey, Nilebis, how are you guys doing?
What's everyone drinking?
All right.
I think this is where...
Cool.
I can't believe you got the tech to work so well.
Can you hear me?
Okay.
Sweet.
Technical difficulties always happens with a multi-camera setup.
Yes, man, what are you doing?
Read back in.
There we go.
Now we're going to hear.
Great.
Cool.
Sweet.
All right, so how do we make this?
Read.
Lead me through it.
Yes.
One teaspoon of just some sugar.
All right.
So I've got sugar syrup, which is what the recipe told me to get.
All right.
And then some orange bitters for the orange bitters.
All right.
Got me some orange bitters.
My wife had a 30th birthday party with like 30 bottles of gin and just made gin cocktails.
And so we have this leftover.
And we still have about some.
Still have about 30 bottles of gin left over.
Awesome.
Get some ice in here.
Crush that out.
That should be good.
And then the rum.
Yeah, the rum or whatever.
I'm using the maker's mic.
I've got a good Woodford Reserve, which was the drink I drank with Dr. Josh introduced me to it.
Nice.
So I didn't measure out my shock, but I'm an Australian on Sunday.
So I just poured in whatever I felt was necessary.
And then to a Halloween party later tonight.
I got a little extra.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Awesome.
All right.
I really need to have a drink.
I need to step up.
My game.
So is this like your go-to drink?
Or is this a second go-to drink?
Yeah, this is my go-to drink.
Check it out.
I got the cube.
Oh, nice.
That's so good.
My set.
We go to the pool.
You've got the full setup.
I love it.
I love it.
For those who are listening on the podcasting apps in the future,
Reed has a multi-camera setup, three cameras,
showing every angle as he's putting together this old fashioned.
It's awesome.
He's got like everything so good.
Yep.
And I think you've seen it done this in the bars a few times.
You're just going to an orange.
Oh, yeah.
Around the edge there.
Drop it in.
And usually add a cherry as well.
I don't have cherries.
But no worries.
Mmm.
Here we go.
It's so good.
Look at that.
That is perfection.
Mine isn't as perfect perfect,
but it's getting there.
It'll do the job.
Yeah, no worries.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, that's good.
That is really good actually.
So I guess make your...
Yeah, yeah.
And I'll remove the drink cans.
Whoops, wrong.
I removed the wrong cam.
I was actually thinking about getting a dog cam
for my little beagle.
He's just chilling down here.
And so if anyone would like a dog cam,
puppy cam, we should make it happen.
So Reed, we've been talking for a long time.
I didn't realize how many years it's been.
So yeah.
Oh yeah.
I guess first like I've always been interested.
I've heard bits and pieces,
but I've always been interested
in what your journey was actually like.
So do you want to give everyone a bit of a run through
about like what did growing up for young Reed Leclerc?
Yeah, sure.
I grew up in Bristol, Virginia
on the Tennessee border of Virginia.
And grew up in...
Is that like,
is that like the movie
October Sky?
Have you seen that movie where they like launch frog?
Is that like that kind of area of Virginia?
Not exactly,
but that area of Virginia is very familiar to me.
That's where my mom's family is from
and my dad's family kind of.
My dad and my grandfather's actually owned
a whole series of coal mines in that area.
If you've watched October Sky,
that you know,
in modern day,
you don't have to actually go down in the mine
like they used to nowadays.
It's all with a huge power tools and trucks and stuff.
But yeah,
did go to that area a lot growing up as well.
Wow.
Accompanying my dad to the mine.
Wow, that's so cool.
Wow.
So you didn't grow up in that.
You grew up in a part of Virginia,
but not there.
You just went there.
Yeah, I just went there sometimes
when my dad took me to work sometimes.
He was a supervisor
of the mining operation in engineer.
Okay, okay, cool.
So did you grow up in a traditional Christian,
have a Christian upbringing?
I did more so when I was younger.
We would go to Southern Baptist Church fairly often,
not every week for sure,
but at least once or twice a month
until the age of maybe seven or eight
and then kind of drop down to Christmas
and Easter.
Yeah.
What's a Southern Baptist Church look like in Virginia?
As far as I can remember is,
just pews, organ music,
very kind of somber and serious
and hymns and then a preacher,
one person went up and preached for a while
and then offered an altar call
and offering at some point at the end there.
So was it,
did you guys believe in speaking in tongues
or any of that Pentecostal stuff?
No.
Okay, right.
So okay, so were you a pretty,
in regards to your personal,
how you felt personally,
were you quite a firm believer
or were you just kind of doing it out of tradition
or like how did you view Christianity from a,
well, I can only imagine that you've had the same brain,
but you've got a very logical, unique brain,
I would say, like the way you think.
So how did you view Christianity back then?
I always thought it was weird.
It did conflict with what I was hearing in school,
in private school, especially at the science part.
And we were taught in literal Adam and Eve
and I remember that being very strange
and like a nose flood and stuff.
And I just kind of took it more as stories,
but the God existing itself,
I was always wondering how do people know this?
I remember thinking, well, who wrote this Bible?
I remember hearing the term, the New Testament.
I'm like, well, why is there a new one?
That was weird.
There's always a pain really to go to church
and everyone really wanted to go
and it was more a tradition for me.
Right, so if you were talking to Ray Comfort right now,
he would ask you, did you have a relationship with Christ?
And it's a trick question obviously because
if you say yes, then he says,
oh, well, you believe in Christ and if you say no,
then he goes, well, told you,
you never really experienced Jesus.
But from your perspective back then,
did you have a relationship with Jesus?
Did you pray to God or feel anything?
There was one moment where
like during some kind of
Bible school or something,
when I went downstairs
while the service was going on,
they did like a
come to Jesus type moment
where they took me by myself
and had me pray
and say all the words
to come to Christ.
And I remember being very emotional at that point, crying.
That was the most it ever got in terms of emotionality.
How old were you when that happened?
Maybe 10, 10 or 11.
Wow.
Did you know what you,
did you kind of know what you were doing back then
or was it just like you were going with
what you were told or
did you understand the concept of like
forgiveness and all that stuff?
Not really at that point, no.
Interesting.
So do you think part of the,
why do you think you're crying then?
I don't know, it was just
emotional manipulation.
I like how you just say it like that.
It is actually,
it is quite nerve wracking to put yourself
in that situation where everyone in the room
is like believing in this thing
and it doesn't matter what it is
and then you get it kind of ushered into this moment
with the tensions on you and you're kind of like
okay, you're going to meet this thing
that everyone in this room is talking in
and obviously believing in.
So even that amount of pressure
is like, even if they're
praying to the flying spaghetti monster
it's still like a whoa,
there might be something here.
It can be a very confusing feeling.
I remember a moment in youth group where
I was praying for one of my friends
who came, I was in a Pentecostal
Pentecostal kind of church
and I remember one of these moments where
I was praying for one of my friends from school
who came and she was crying
but the way she was crying didn't feel
like it was a good,
it felt like she was just very confused
because like everyone around her was kind
of like slain in the spirit as they say
and speaking in tongues and all that kind of stuff
and I was praying for her
and kind of prophesying over her and she's
just like kind of shocked and crying
and then she didn't come back or anything
but I just remember thinking like
I wasn't a normal cry, it was like a
I'm confused cry
and I wonder if a lot of people
have that experience where
they're just kind of pressured into it
and then they, they're looking for like a way
to stabilize their emotions and then they
find something to grab on to
I wonder if that has anything to do with it
but I don't know, I'm not a
I'm not a psychologist or
anyone in the relevant field.
Either, yeah, it's just a lot of build up
and then release, it's like you're trying
to get a release from it.
So
so
when did you first having doubts about
like your Christian faith in general?
So it sounds like it was a little bit of like a back burner
like it's there but it's not like a huge part
of your identity but when did you first start
kind of questioning even that small
part of your identity that was kind of maybe there?
Yeah, I went to boarding school
in Chattanooga, Tennessee
and
I took one of an eastern religions course
I learned a lot about eastern religions
Hinduism in particular
and just
that was really the first time I dug
into that in detail
and learning how so many people could believe
something completely different from me
these different gods
I
went on a trip down to
Atlanta
to actually visit a Hindu temple
and saw, you know, actually people in the flesh
and blood were actually praying
and, you know, worshiping these
these gods in a temple
and now they would, you know
give offerings to all that
and
that made me think about a lot of stuff, yeah?
I had a similar experience
when my wife and I first started traveling
we started noticing other religions
and like how devout some of the followers were
and things like that
and it was, for me, it was quite eye-opening
but I remember bringing back footage
we went to China
and we went to Zhengzhou Ji
and there's like a Buddhist temple at the top of like
this mountain
and we went to it and there's got like
a female Buddha in there
and it's got like a Buddha of the past, the present
and the future so like big three big Buddha statues
and they look after your past, your present, your future
and all this stuff
and we bring back the footage
and we're showing, you know, we're showing
some of our friends and we're like
oh look at this, like this is, you know
and they're Christian and we're like this is so radical
this is like just, I've never heard of this kind of
religion ideas before
and one of them I think got offended at one stage
and stood up abruptly, go get a drink of water
and said, I can't believe these people believe this
shit
and
and I kind of just like
you know, you just kind of like
and just like kept going through the
the travel footage or whatever
but in my head I'm like
every religion looks funny from the outside
I mean like if I was to explain Christianity to them
I would say like, okay so
they believe in a
God that sacrificed himself
to himself to serve as
the loophole for rules that he created
that he can't circumvent because the devil
was an angel and the devil
but the devil had free will
so he rebelled and God doesn't want to kill him yet
he wants to kill him like
and if you're good you'll go to heaven
and if you're bad you'll get tortured forever
like it sounds like from an outside perspective
it's just like this is nuts
right
and so I find that
I love what the creators of South Park say
they say like every religion looks wacky from the outside
that's only when you get into it
that you kind of forgive all the nuances
definitely, exactly
yeah
and just
trying to see the Hindu temple from
their outside and then kind of looking back
from their perspective at Christianity of my own beliefs
is
kind of a stranger
hmm
so how did you approach these doubts
like when you saw
well not doubts but when you
saw that how did you start approaching those
those doubts
both emotionally and intellectually I guess
at that point really
I didn't
the class ended and I didn't only think too much about it
for a while
then I just
I didn't really think about religion
all that much and I went to college
but then I got
freshman year
I had an atheist roommate
and I went to film school
and he had the stead cam
and he was like really cool in my eyes
but like on
his stead cam vest he had like
a cross with
the red you know
no smoking sign on it
like a bad religion type
icon and I'm like well that's
interesting but I never really talked to him
about religion I just knew that he was like
it was at the 2005
ish
year so that was when the new atheism
movement was starting to get a bit of traction
and I just saw him
being an atheist
that was probably the first person that I saw
that I knew
he was an atheist and he was great
he was one of my best friends
and just seeing
seeing that
probably did a lot
to affect me later on
when I did
de-convert shortly after college
okay so
so he wasn't eating babies
or anything like that
weird
if you say babies
so did you ever talk to him at all about religion
or was that like an after
you just kind of noticed that he was an atheist
and he was not a psycho
yeah I didn't really
talk to him about it at all but he was very
he would always wear shirts with
you know very provocative stuff on it
but never talked to him about it
I feel like is he still like that
or was it like a phase
I don't know
it's probably a phase at that point
but he's still very out there
I feel like everyone
goes through
everyone who deconstructs usually goes through
what I call the edge lord atheist days
where they just love
they want to scream
they want to challenge everyone
and be provocative and stuff
I definitely went through that
when I was going through stuff
so how did you actually
you know the eastern things like
eastern religions kind of there
and kind of
that kind of opened you up to
the idea that other religions can have
different beliefs and they can believe them just as strongly as you
and then you have this atheist
roommate who isn't
it's just like seems like a normal person
how did you go from that to eventually
analyzing your beliefs
was it like a long process or did you just one day
wake up and you go I don't know if I believe in
God anymore
yeah this maybe takes a little bit of setup
I went to film school
2500-2010
at the end of film school
a bunch of my friends roommates and I
got it in our heads that we had to make a future film
so
basically the semester
the summer semester right before
what can I just
did you go to I went to film school as well
when I dropped out but did you go to film school
when you were using actual film still
like did you have to do film
to digital at that stage
it was 2005-2010
and that was when it switched to digital
I remember going to
a
film school like summer
camp in high school
and I used film then
that was a program they offered
but in college
it had just switched to digital
and like every year there was a
revolution in camera technology
and it just got getting cheaper
and cheaper and cheaper
and at the last
year DSLRs came out
that you could just get
extremely high quality HD
beautiful looking footage
and like holy crap
we got to make a movie
so we decided to make one
one of my roommates produced it
the other one wrote it
and this my roommate who wrote it
it's just he likes
really high concept stuff
and at that point he was a Christian
and he made this
he wrote this script
and I guess I'll just give the twist away
it takes place
in a pre-life world
and
there's 11 forces trying to get
at these few people in the
sirens condo
and at one point they have to make a choice
in order to actually get to
be born
for real in the real world
and
you know I don't really care
what the story was
I just wanted to make a movie
but we shot three fourths
of the movie over the summer
we got as far as we could
and I had a lot of this footage
to edit over the next few months
and
I just started thinking
about the consequences of the actions
of the characters and the themes of the story
and
at the same time
when I was not editing
I was browsing this new
at least new to me
a website called reddit
and
at the time the rAtheism subreddit
was a default
thing that would appear on your homepage
if you weren't signed in
or even if you were signed in
it was just a default thing that showed up
so as you were browsing
you would see every so often
rAtheism
and
I've been banned from that sub like three times
on three different accounts
oh my gosh
at the time it was
fairly popular
so I started clicking on a few links
eventually I think I found
a few episodes of the atheist experience
and at first
I was very
taken aback by it, very annoyed
like who are these people to say
that doesn't exist, like what the hell
that's not right
but I was just a little curious
and I started watching some episodes
and
didn't take long after watching
other channels like Mr. Deity
just seeing
seeing the whole beliefs laid out
you know as they actually are
as the logic of it
entails
just being parodied in that way
it wasn't long until
I
completely
just deconverted all the
the remaining bits
of my faith for sure yeah
yeah right
so
was there like an aha moment
or was it just a kind of you just
looked back and realized you weren't
you no longer believed in God or
I don't remember exactly
if there was a moment
a
you know I don't think I believe this anymore
I remember sitting
at my chair and then looking outside
and thinking holy crap
you know we're on a planet
floating through space like this is
a fragile precarious
predicament we're in
this is it
it's just us
together
so that was a bit
disconcerting
and then
just took the next
few years just
reading up on all the
stuff I could find
start reading new
atheist books and articles
reading other blogs
at the time
watching videos watching movies
just taking it all in
right do you have any books that
really stood out to you
that helped you in your kind of
journey
I like Sam Harris's The End of Faith
that was really good
and
just
yeah
Mr. DeeDee on YouTube
the atheist experience
the thinking atheist at the time
yeah
yeah
different podcasts
and just
yeah stuff like that
yeah right
I don't know if I've read The End of Faith
but I've read Waking Up
and I used to live in
Mount Coulomb and I'd go for walks
in the quarry around there
with my dog at the time
and listen to that and it was like
it was my it was crazy
like Sam Harris is a nut job
in the best way possible
it's just yeah crazy
someone said
I could legit
listen to read read TNCs
you've got
you've got such a good
radio voice it's awesome
thank you thank you
so
so
when did you discover critical
thinking in this process
like did you
kind of
yeah when did you just discover critical thinking
in this process unlike the journey
did you like was it through the atheist experience
that you kind of
started to evaluate those beliefs and that got you more interested
in it or
shortly after college around
late 2011 I moved to
here in Los Angeles
and
the next year I joined a local
atheist meetup club
Atheist United here in Los Angeles
started attending
just talks
from various people
and in late 2013
I went to this talk by this guy
called Peter Bregosian
he had this
talk about
a manual for creating atheists
and he had a book about it
so I read that
shortly afterwards
and that really inspired me
and it
talked
a lot about critical thinking this aquatic method
and now
faith is the linchpin
it's like the cryptomite of
religion
it's a people use it as an epistemology
they use it in other ways
but sometimes they use it to justify
believing in stuff
and just framing
the religion debate
like it was always watching debates as well
and people would just throw out arguments and stuff
but they would rarely get down to the
method of how they're
checking the quality of those reasons
and never getting
down to the core
justification
and a lot of times when you just
peel it back
all the way
well it's just
faith
I just believe
and if you
try to
have a conversation around
that and get to that
and ask questions around that
seeing if that's a good way
to come to beliefs in general
that is
an interesting way to have conversations about religion
and that opened up
my mind to just thinking
in those terms
how do we know what's true
what are good reasons
and that's
something on the path to learn about critical thinking
yeah
I remember talking to
a Christian friend
in a bar
circa 2017
or something
and
and he kind of dismissed
he said two things he's a smart guy
and he's quite Pentecostal
and
he believes that he's people who have been raised
from the dead kind of thing like that level of
woo I guess
fringe parts of the Pentecostal movement
and
he says that
a few things he says you can't
you have to accept the
undeniability of scripture because
the perfectness of scripture because otherwise
you can just throw out the whole thing
and I said to him
well
well I wasn't doing a street of cosmology so I just said to him
can you see that you've just made an excuse
like you've just made an excuse there
you've said I don't care what reality is I'm just going to
accept this one thing for whatever reason
the other thing he said was
was that
the Socratic method
comes from Greek thought
and that he doesn't necessarily believe
that that's the best way to think about things
so it's like
you evaluate
and I was hoping we could like maybe
discuss this quickly as a side tangent
or maybe not quickly deep drink podcast
we do tendons all the time but
how do we justify
the Socratic method as being
the best way to
evaluate against the world
or like to come to
or logic and reason I should say
to come to a real understanding of the world
how do we justify that
it
it's very
similar to the scientific method
you
start with wondering about something
usually a question
and then you offer a hypothesis
some kind of answer to the question
and then someone
ask questions about this answer
they try to test it
they try to figure out what is this answer
either
predict or infer
and then you
ask questions around that
does this lead to a contradiction
does this make sense
in some way
and it usually comes to
either some kind of aporia or dead end
but then you offer someone to revise
their answer
and you start over the process again
and you just go through this question
and answer process
until you're
left with something that withstands the criticism
and that's kind of mirroring how
science
goes about testing hypotheses
and having provisional knowledge
hmm
yeah I get that
and that's part of why I accept it
I won't mention their name
but I've had the
the
misfortune of having long email exchanges
with a critic
of the
street epistemology
way
of SE in general
and they mentioned
they were just quizzing me
on how do you know
how can you trust your senses
how can you trust your logic
if you use your logic to justify your logic
like all those presuppositional arguments
and when I flip the script
and ask them
over and over and over again
you need to give me a concrete answer
on how you justify your beliefs
or no I said
what's the best way to examine the universe
or to come up with answers to the universe
because I was saying it's the scientific method
they said
it's to have faith
in faith
to have 100% faith in Jesus Christ
and I said how does that teach us
about the atom
how do we make
evaluations of an atom
we're having faith in Jesus
like how does that make sense
now it's easy to dismiss that
and go okay
they're just making
justify it
they're just justifying their beliefs
with nonsense
or just giving you a throwaway answer
but I sometimes wonder
what if there is something to that
and we just can't see
not something to it that sounds bad
but what if we just can't see
not even reasoning
what if we just can't see their perspective
what if there's literally like a block
and that we're viewing things
in a way that
that
only makes sense
under a certain paradigm
does that make sense
if you talk to a lot of people
who do psychedelics
and talk about quantum mechanics
but they have this other experience
how do we know that that experience
the like some real experience
and what
how we're trying to evaluate things
it's a story that we're telling ourselves
that gives certain answers
but there are other answers out there
if you ask different questions
Jews
sorry
deep drinks podcast
the drinks and the deep drink podcast
I don't know
I mean
yeah
feel free to offer any hypothesis you want
it's the testing of the hypothesis
that science
emphasizes
can you predict anything
can you use it in some way
yeah
what how can you tell if you're mistaken
if someone used your same process
but concluded something the opposite
how could someone from the outside
seeing both of you
tell what was actually the case
hmm
how do we adjudicate
any kind of conflict there
yeah
yeah
and well
I think that
it's hard because I agree
I think the scientific method is the best tool we have
to examining the natural world
or anything
it's the best
but
I often wonder
if I'm trying to be a good face
to these
these other people's beliefs
as I possibly can
because like you imagine
so just to
just to wrap up this tangent a little bit
but I used to develop video games
I used to do when I first started
I was very creative
I was like just bang on
with my creativity
I was making this game called burger run
this fat dude ate burgers
and then I realized I needed to learn how to program
to make video games right
so I spent a year
just watching programming tutorials
learning how to code
I even trained the way I used to think about things
nothing was grey anymore it was black and white
I think that's actually part of the process that led me
to question my beliefs
is I had to like view things as true or false
and
when I went back to actually start making a game
I lost all my creativity
I hadn't flexed those creativity muscles anymore
and I had no ideas for coming to me
and I found it really hard to come up with
like the broad brush strokes
the grays
in my creative process
and
it literally was just a different way of thinking
that had different outcomes
so I guess if you are after objective truth of the universe
the scientific method is a great tool
but if you want to
feel the emotion of a love song
you can't really write that on a pen and paper right?
yeah
I think there's different stages of the scientific method
in the testing part of the hypothesis
you want your results to be unambiguous
either it's this way or this way
or some other way
a bunch of different options
unambiguous
no creativity is just there
but if you back up
and go back to the hypothesis
creation stage
for any phenomenon in the world
you'd like to
hypothesize
just imagine any
particular cause you could think of
generate
through your creativity as many hypotheses as possible
so maybe
I don't know how you preserve this creativity
capacity but
science requires some creativity as well
light
bending
that's pretty creative
a bunch of hypotheses
that turned out to be the case
we're far out there
non-intuitive
so it requires
creativity for sure
yeah that makes sense actually
the start of it is like the imagining
the wonder
the
the what could be
cause
you look at like Einstein's ideas
and stuff like general relativity
things like that and they sound
just crazy like they sound outlandish
but the thing is like
they work the maths works
and the observations come true
you know
actually I don't know if
all of Einstein's stuff came true
cause we recently had a new discovery about
quantum mechanics
something I don't know
anyway back to your story
how did you first learn about street epistemology
yeah in 2013
well I think I first heard
about Peter Bogosian in the thinking atheist podcast
and then I read the book
or started reading it and then Peter Bogosian
did a talk in LA
and I didn't really do much
in 2014 related to street epistemology
it wasn't until
early 2015
that I was watching something on YouTube
but then I saw
this video from this guy called
Anthony Magnumosco
at that time in early 2015
he was doing
kind of a version
of street epistemology
where he was mainly yelling at street preachers
outside the Alamo
I've looked for those videos
I don't know if they're still there
I'm trying real hard to look for those videos
I couldn't find them
so I went to his playlists
I think they're unlisted
so go back to 2015 playlist
early
but that was interesting
but then he started doing it
getting feedback from the community
in the comments
and on Facebook
and he would start asking more questions
and people would be
would slow down and think
about these questions
and it was very different from
his experience
other atheist debates
and he would see people think
and then he started going to
a campus
and really
developing his style
becoming more
open and cordial
and that really got me into street epistemology
at that time
I started participating more in the Facebook group
and around
mid 2015
this video chat site
called BLAB
was launched
and it's kind of like what TikTok Live is now
where you have up to like 4 people
on video
and a chat at the same time
and you can just chat with people
and the chat can award people points
and
a bunch of us from the street epistemology community
talk with people for
a year straight
24 7 almost
not much productivity
happened in that year
but we practiced street epistemology
and
we really started seeing how
effective this way of talking
with people was
Side note, I would love
to see you with a few old
after a few old fashioned scream
create content screaming at street preachers
so
you release a video and you just screaming
and that was so funny
it was so good
because one thing
I love about your content
is you're so level headed through it
I've seen one where you've gotten like pissed off
and I'm sure there's a bunch
but there was that one where
star signs, I think star signs trigger you the most
that's the thing that triggers you
star signs or
astrology
personality traits to me permanent ones
even if they're true
it's just
insulting
for some reason it's insulting
so
and it's funny too because
I've sent your video to some friends
I used to go to youth group with and stuff
my favorite episode is TIA
TIA
I've watched it about a million times
I really love it
and I've got a link in the description
but it's fascinating
they come back with
what gives him all the answers
because
they don't understand the concept
and they can see clearly that this
TIA girl is struggling a little bit
but what I love is you don't have the answers
in fact I've seen you have conversations with people
about things you believe in
like I think
there was climate change one at the time
and you were challenging them
like you were asking questions to get them to explain
why they believed in climate change
and then they kind of got a bit stuck
because they didn't have a good answer
and then they asked you and you said oh yeah I believe
for these reasons
and
so that's what I love about your content
because you're very
you're very like chill
when people watch your stuff
level headed
and you got that voice
so do you remember
when you first started doing street epistemology
maybe you can actually
tell everyone what street epistemology actually is
because I gave a short introduction at the start
but for someone who hasn't seen it
what is street epistemology
one of the official definitions we're using now
in the course
we're writing a course
we've been writing it
and a bunch of other volunteers
so module one
the definition of street epistemology
is the long version you don't have to use this technical version
but street epistemology
is a way of applying a set of philosophy
and psychology based tools
there's civil conversation
to help ourselves and others
reflect on the quality of the reasons
one might have to support the level of confidence
that a claim is true
try to make it
that long version
you can maybe scientifically test
a shorter way to say it
is a way to help you reflect on the quality
of their reasoning through civil conversation
so
when did you first start
going out into the field and having
doing street epistemology
like IRL
I started
summer of 2016
I was still volunteering for Atheist United
at that time
at the
Ellie Times Festival of Books
and we had a booth there
I set up a table and a really janky
GoPro
and blue Yeti mic setup
and did it for the first time in public
after doing it for a while
on Blab
but actually doing it in public with people face to face
that was very different
and after that
I started then going out to
local Griffith Park
just below the Griffith Observatory
set up a table
and that same janky mic setup
and GoPro setup
and started just talking with people sitting there
letting people come to me
and
practicing getting feedback, watching myself back
on video, I was not the best
starting out for sure
and just did that for
months
and every week for about 3 hours
and got a lot of great feedback
is there something that
like
is the process of SE for you
is it more about
is it like something that you really enjoy
helping people kind of
think about their beliefs
or is it
because I know that person that's been emailing
say it's like a tool for Atheism
or it's a tool for
something like that
but I know that you don't really hold to that idea
so why is it that you do SE
and my goals have shifted over time
when I first started out
I had the expectation that I could
potentially
like to convert someone on the spot
that was a really dumb goal
to have
I got some people to think
to reflect
some to
reduce their confidence a little bit in
supernatural stuff
but at this point
if I ever talk about religion
or supernatural stuff it's mainly planting
some kind of SE
for further reflection
and I'm not
expecting them to
change their mind on the spot for sure
especially for these core religious beliefs
that's not a wise expectation
I do want people to
not so much just
lose their faith
I want them to
be good critical thinkers
and if that results in
losing some kind of belief
then
as long as you do it for good reasons
that's fine if you care about believing
true things
cool so it's not necessarily about religion either
it's about any belief right
yeah
yeah we started
realising
this technique could
apply to virtually anything
anybody said
social issues, politics
yeah it's very versatile
in that way
yeah
so
have you seen a
shift in what people
say how long you've been doing this like 5 years now
5 plus years
since 2016
so about 6 years
so have you seen a shift in
what people believe more
like what people are wanting to talk about more
or less at all in that time
I started offering my own topics
maybe 2017
2018 a little
board next to my table
and I started shifting after
November 20
it was very shortly after I started
November 2016 Trump being elected
at that time I was like holy crap
that's interesting
so I started shifting more to politics
and social issues and all the stuff that was happening in the news
so
I would always
either have some of those topics on the board
for people to pick
so I don't really have an
unbiased way to tell
if someone just wanted to talk about something
I always had
various options for people to pick
and that might have had a selection bias
so hard to know
have you noticed
have you noticed people
have stopped using certain words
for example
did people used to say
oh this is natural
or this is
it's natural to do this
have you noticed that change a little bit
or someone started using the words
um
have you noticed trans issues come
into it a little bit more or anything like that
or is it more being pretty
hard to tell because you've had your own kind of topics
yeah I think
some
of the last year people are starting to think more
about gender and trans stuff
just last week
I set up
my table with a white board
I used these little magnets for people to use
to write down claims or questions
and it was we were doing a
conversation a spectrum style
SE, me and Dolly when some other person
and other people just walking by
here at UCLA
and someone wrote what is a woman
as a potential thing to talk about
I'm stuck in the board
for an option
so that's a
that's something that's now
in the zeitgeist
yeah interesting
have you got any horror stories
I hope you do
not really, not much
one time I was just sitting there
in the Griffith Park and someone sat down
and just flipped me off
they probably
mistook me for a Scientologist
I had the sign
what do you believe and why on it
which is very similar to their phrasing
or like David Crowder
oh here he is again
yeah
besides that
not really, not much
yeah it's been fairly
nonviolent
yeah
what are your
what are your favourite conversations
like favourite topics to cover
and what are your least favourite topics to cover
for some reason I still like
talking about astrology
even though it makes me mad
it's so bizarre
that people take it that seriously
yeah not so much religion anymore
now I want to talk more about
social issues
related to identity politics
that seems to be
a hot button issue
that people have hard times talking about
not so much
I find like
domestic policy or foreign policy boring
but I'm open to talking about that
it's the more cultural war issues
wedge issues
that are interesting to me
hmm
yeah
I noticed that on either side of the political aisle
the far right and the far left seem to
kind of shoot themselves in the foot a little bit
like
in regards to like I feel like the far left
pushes people to the right
and then the right as that
is there with open arms
and the far right are so insane
that they push people
I don't know it just seems like
in America there seems to be such a
dichotomy of thought
like the
centrist to grow
in far between
it seems like
I don't know if that's actually true
or if it's something I've witnessed
yeah I think there is more polarization
unfortunately
and so is street epistemology
is that like something
is part of it like
to help some of that polarization
is that what like you're hoping to get out of it personally
yeah I think so I think if we listen
to people more and
first listen to understand
then we can find common ground
and bring us more together
yeah exactly
do you have any success stories
another conversation I had
was with this guy called Dominique
and I don't I've never talked to him again
but at the time
he seemed to
kind of grasp this crucial concept
of falsifiability
and the value of having our beliefs
be testable
just right in that moment
and he really thought about that
and thanked me for talking about that
that was cool
besides that
just
just the
general positive feedback
I get maybe
one out of ten
one out of six
talks that you know thank you
for helping me think through this
this was fun
you don't often get a chance to do this
this was interesting
I like what you're doing
I find that to be
very nice
I used to binge your videos
all the time I think I watched
every one of your videos
when they came out I would watch
I loved it so much
I still do watch it but
at the stage of my life I was just bingeing it
and
I remember
using some of the techniques
some of the street personality techniques
and some of the way that you present yourself
on having hard conversations with
not just like
my friends and family who may be religious
or whatever
or believe something differently to me
whether it's vaccines or whatever
but
even like conversations
with my managers at work
or like arguments
that me and my wife would get into
we would use those techniques
on each other to try and
get to the root of where
the disagreements were coming from
instead of pointing the finger
and saying you did this
or whatever
at work I'll just ask
more socratic method style questions
to try and lead them to the conclusion
that I think
is where my brain is
you know what I mean?
definitely
science
broadly speaking
is kind of a conflict management type of system
and there's always conflict
potentially happening in workplaces
you have a problem
management has different ideas how to solve a problem
there's arguments happening
and we
with SEI the non-profit
we're starting to get more
inquiries about how SE
could potentially help them in their business
some people are starting to
use it and
it sounds like it's helping
but we're still very early on
and if utilizing
SE in this way it's very new
and I hope to
see it grow in that direction
so do you have any
so first of all
I've got so many questions but first of all
what is SEI?
SEI street epistemology international
is a non-profit we started
in 2019
Anthony Mike Dabowsko
is the executive director and the president
FYI
everything I'm saying here is
just my own thoughts and beliefs
being a non-profit
and
just before we went on live
you were screaming at some people
out your windows and street preachers
yeah and
over the past few years
we started building up the board
got a bunch of different projects the main project is
the creation of a street epistemology
self-directed course
which has been taking forever but we've been getting
really good stuff like stay tuned
it's really good stuff
and
besides that we're also doing research on
street epistemology
a preliminary paper is like almost in the works
for that
besides that we also help support
SEI content creators
help fund
their efforts
that's been what we're doing
if someone wants to
start doing SEI
and they don't have the funds
this organization
is going to help them
is that the idea?
yep you can submit
a request for funds
and we will most likely help you out
that is so cool
and so the goal of this
is just to keep spreading
critical thinking
and the scientific method
the idea of the scientific method
you don't have to be a scientist to do the scientific method
you can use it in everything
that's so cool
so
I guess we could touch a little bit on
why does SEI matter
for you
why is it so important for you
that you've dedicated so much of your life
to this
there are various goals for why you use SEI
your own
personal goals can be just to better understand
other people
sometimes you hear
something someone says
and you can use SEI to better understand
what they're saying
you can also just if you care about
critical thinking you can use SEI to practice
critical thinking
with people who make claims
it's a great way to
to do that
and also
you can use SEI to go for other
other people
sometimes someone says something
and you disagree or think it's false
as long as you're open minded
and being willing to be wrong
you can question them about it
and potentially help them
reflect
on the process they're using for that
and help themselves
update their beliefs
a kind of persuasion
a kind of way to
teach people critical thinking in the moment
and then have them apply those tools
to their beliefs
and they not only
potentially revise their confidence in that
particular belief but then use
the tools they use to do that
and apply that to many other beliefs in their life
this on a societal level
if that starts spreading
people will believe more true beliefs less false beliefs
and that would be better
for society
public policy
affects us all
our own individual beliefs
affect each other
and it would be a better world
if our maps actually reflected
the reality within
so do you think
do you have
a secret source for say if someone comes up to you
just like in a bar
or at the halloween party you're going to
tonight and says something
and you just agree with
like oh you're a Libra
or you're a Scorpio so therefore XYZ
how do you
I imagine that most of the time you just
smile and nod and kind of
go to the cheese board or whatever you do
and then like what you don't engage
but so let's say you do want to engage with someone
how do you normally start that interaction
outside of like a formal SE
would you have advice for people
yeah that is really the main way
SE is done
it's not done
on a college campus
or in the park
most of the time it's between individuals
even though I virtually only do it
on campus or at a park
and I rarely do it with just random people
even my friends or family
so I actually have very little
experience doing that
probably mainly
due to my own personality
but I could give advice from them
of course we've got it's just
start building rapport, make small talk
say something like oh that's very interesting
do you mind if I ask you questions about that
explain what SE is
and just get consent
to do the conversation
and you can just
go from there
do you have a way that you
are
out
like you diffuse the conversations
if it's getting too heavy
I've had experiences where
I've tried to use SE
I was at my wife's work event
these ladies came up
they thought I was still like a practicing on fire
believing Christian
and they started showing me footage of someone
getting out of a wheelchair in Africa or something
or started talking about it on my phone
and then telling me how good God is and stuff
and why don't I come to their church
and then they kept asking
and I was like well I don't necessarily subscribe
to a lot of the beliefs that's from the pulpit
and they're like oh what do you mean
if I ask you about your beliefs
but eventually
they were both like angry
but I was trying to be as calm and polite as possible
do you have a way to diffuse
those kind of moments
or to not get
to those moments
especially with religious beliefs
it's best to not
send these messages out from the very beginning
like saying
making it adversarial
or you know
I believe that I don't believe that
I'm not on your team, not on your side
it could just be more open and curious
and
be open to learning more about that
just
pretend like you're just
learning about this for the first time
you never knew about this
and
even kind of think
they know the truth, I just want to learn
about yourself in that mindset
how do we know this is the case
and
learn more about it, ask questions
repeat back
use active listening
kind of see what the benefit
they're getting from this
is
and
and share how that
would be really great
if that was the case that people can
be healed instantly
if that's true, I'm just not sure
at this point
can you explain to me
how this works
and why do you believe this
how could we know if this is
actually potentially not the case
always doing it
very slowly, cordially
and talking to people
that way
have you ever had
I've had this experience, I'm just wondering if you had as well
have you ever asked someone about their beliefs
in that way
and they say, I don't know
so
I've had friends who've
said to me that the earth is definitely flat
and I said, why do you think that
and they said, I can't remember
and I said, what do you mean you can't remember
like you think that's flat
I researched it, okay
or the same with vaccines, I can't remember
why they bet
I'd love to know why they're bad
tell me more about it
if they're bad, I don't want to take a vaccine
tell me about why the vaccines are bad
and then I can't remember
I don't know
have you ever had that
it was just my friends
I'm sure it's happened
it's also good
to think about
what these kind of beliefs are doing for people
psychologically and socially
if you run out
if you're going down the epistemic road
talking about how they know something
and you get the feeling
that they're too uncomfortable
or they don't want to talk about it
there's some kind of psychosocial motivation
happening around the belief
and it's great
to talk about that stuff
in a way that they don't feel judged
if you talk about that
what is this belief doing for you
if you no longer had this belief in a few years
how would your life change
what would be missing from your life
and
different thought experiment questions
related to that
where that reveals these psychosocial motivations
because a lot of our beliefs
are tied to that stuff
if we haven't thought about it too much
we're human
and
if you talk about different strategies
for meeting the needs that the beliefs
are helping us meet these needs
if you
switch them out with or at least have
potential other ways of meeting those needs
then you can go back
to start talking more about the bestology
and feel more safe doing it
and
it relieves a lot of pressure
a lot of bias
and before you could
leave it there
and then pick up the conversation at another time
but thinking of
these kind of beliefs in those terms
in addition to the epistemology
is
really advantageous
interesting
so
so
that is all super fascinating
but I know we've only got like 90 minutes ish
so I want to jump into some Q&A questions
so if anyone's got any questions
make sure to type it in the chat
and I also want to
advertise a few things
so everyone make sure you go
and subscribe to cordial curiosity
it is, I mean how many videos you've got
like a lot, I think it was like 150 or something
you've got a lot of videos
yeah the best year
I haven't been uploading as much
I've been doing other things
but now for the past month or so
I've been going out once a week
for like at least three or four hours with Dolly
juggling lessons to record
stuff at UCLA
so stay tuned, I've got a bunch of footage
and it's coming
and this episode
TIAT is
is just amazing
I really love
I just really love the way you handle this
someone said to me
this man has the best poker face
in the world
it's really good
so everyone make sure you go
subscribe to cordial curiosity and if you want to learn more about SE
all the links obviously
in the description of this video
and on
Reed's YouTube channel here
and there's some cool stuff coming up
I just also want to mention some stuff that we normally mention at the start
but I'm mentioning it here is
we have a few cool episodes coming up
we have Nitty who's in the
I think might still be in the comments here
he's going to be talking about his experience growing up in a
cult church kind of thing
we have Bitty Buddha talking about
ritual agnosticism
so tarot cards, star signs
she doesn't necessarily believe in them
as an atheist but
she likes them so we're going to be talking about that
it's going to be an interesting conversation
and we have
what is a man
with the student doctor Ben
talking about transgenderism
Ben's story and that's going to be
an interesting episode as well
and for those who want to listen to these episodes
we have deep drinks podcast
on Apple, Spotify
everything else like that
so you can listen to it and this episode will be
uploaded shortly after this is finished
speaking of poker face
Nitty
comes to the pine creek poker
poker game my host
once or twice a week
that's been a lot of fun
I keep seeing the invites
because I asked to be on the invite list
but I haven't made it yet
it's been like a year or six months or something
just because it's always at times that I can't do it
but I live in Australia
so it is what it is
for me it's 11am
so if anyone wants to learn more about SE
where can they go
it's kind of a boring question
have you changed your mind
on anything
as major as your religious
deconstruction
since learning about critical thinking
and SE has anyone come to you
maybe with star science and now you are a hard believer
in star science or something
has anyone swayed you
as hard core as the religious
deconstruction
not really
not really
maybe just shifted from being
progressive
in my politics to more
moderate that's the most shift
that's the biggest shift
okay
and did that happen
because of like some conversations
you were having or is it more
to do with
like the zeitgeist
of what you were seeing around
how the left and the right were handling things
yeah just various
stuff happening
and
other
content I've been watching
and
talking with people
about various issues in person
yeah
lots of different factors
interesting
what if anything
would change your mind
this is a question I ask everyone
in general
on the god belief
any kind of miracle
and control testing conditions
that anything that breaks our current models
of empirical theories
like physics
if you
do something similar to like 1 Kings 18
I like pine creeks example
of lighting
some kind of water soak napkin
lighting that on fire
not a really good one
do that in a control testing condition
especially if there's
multiple people
watching and doing it
more than one time
that would be great
what is it 1 Kings 15
it's like the
the story about how
I forget
there's certain tribe
there's two tribes
one tribe believes in one god
another one believes in Yahweh
and they have a competition
if my god is true
he'll light this wood on fire
well not only that
I drenched my wood in water
and
just to make it more hard
and
they pray in the name of
oh Elijah
they light the wood on fire
so that would be pretty good
something like that
or you know limbs getting grown back
people coming back from the dead
well
have you heard about Jesus
he came back from the dead
in prison day
I need something today
yeah I guess
I've been asked this question
my street preacher actually
a street evangelist I guess
and what would change your mind
I didn't have a good answer at the time
I don't know what would convince you of god's existence
because obviously
they go well if you don't know
what would convince you
that's an issue
I ended up thinking about it more
because I didn't have a really good answer
but my answer to that was
in order for me to believe
in the god of the bible
as taking a literal interpretation of the bible
it would be the same thing
that would require me to believe
in a married bachelor
and that is like
because even if the god that you're describing there
like the lighting of the flame
you'd still have all these problems with the bible
like how do you view the bible
how does these things make sense historically
are they historical
are they not historical
so for me to take a literal interpretation
to the bible like the genesis
account
of creation 6000 year old
the contradictions that are there
it would be the same thing
that I would need to believe in a married bachelor
that is it seems like a bit of a
wish washy question but it's like
unless you remove those issues
that are there
you can't view it under the lens of like inherently perfect
yeah there's conflict between all good
and all powerful
stuff like that
but I could still be unsure about the
essential properties but
there's something out there causing
our empirical reality
to violate itself
as best as we know
and that would cause me to question
naturalism
so
this is just a
random aside again
what do you do when you're talking to
someone like a muslim
or a christian
god needed to have created
this universe
something needed to have created us
it makes no sense that we just came from nothing
what do you say to that person
I don't know where the universe came from
but do you agree that it needs a creator
I'm playing devil's advocate here
no
it could be
it could be the case
I don't know
my intuition about that type of thing
is not reliable
yeah that's a good answer
I have a weasley answer as well
to that I say
I believe the universe came from the same place you believe god came from
because obviously they believe god just was
so I just believe the universe either just was
or something just was
to get past the infinite regress problem
but that's a weasley answer
that's just to point out that hey
you don't know either buddy
it could have always existed
or someone could have created it
no idea
we have a question to ask before
we'll be interested
to get the insight into reeds view on
bogasians
bogosians sorry bogosians
current directories feels as though he's been
he's been a shift in his intent and methods
yeah if you've seen
his current youtube channel
it went from 5,000 to over 100,000
in a few months
I was on the reverse q&a tour
he was on this summer
and it's
it was not an SE
themed type of tour
starting out but
his original intent was just to
hear out dissident
college students around wokeness
and critical social justice
hear them out
but we
soon found that that format was not working very well
and we then started the
kind of spectrum format
where there's seven lines on the
on the ground
everyone starts in the middle
everyone agrees on the claim they're discussing
and then they moved
wherever their confidence is
either strongly agreed or strongly disagree
and peter acts as a kind of
SE moderator
and everyone hears each other out
I think I've seen that video
where there was the
transgender
and there's like a viral video
a bunch of students come down from the library
and they confront peter about that
is that home thinking
yes
yeah
we were doing some spectrum SE
on the Portland campus
and that happened
and I think that's evidence
of some potential
bit of bias from certain departments
some problematic attitudes
and mindsets
nothing that's very
compatible with our
preference for critical thinking
being open to hearing people out
stuff like that
so we will
that was part of the goal of the tours to
see if that was happening on any campus
and we got a bunch of good examples of that
but
peter
did that on his tour
got a bunch of good
conversations
and now he's in Hungary
doing the same thing with people in Hungary
conservatives usually
I'm getting footage from
his conversations there right now
and we're planning to do the same thing
in full Florida
in a few months
to get more stuff from
conservatives
so I think peter is
doing SE
and helping expose
the illiberalism on both sides
and trying to figure out
some common ground
and helping anyone
from any side think through
their beliefs
and I support them
do you think
just on that
like viral video of the
people who were really upset at the
trans
lines on the ground
I don't know what exactly it was
but
can you empathize
at all with the
the lack of
engaging in critical
conversations amongst that
because people may be
super sensitive at the moment
in regards to trans issues
especially on campuses since the
days of Jordan Peterson
there's obviously
an issue personally when it comes to
like you should always be able to
engage in critical thinking
but do you see that
do you see that
a lot of the time members
of the LGBT community especially trans
gender community have to kind of justify
their existence to the world
and that a lot of people are like
a lot of their friends and stuff like
that's kind of bullshit and then they
like actively I guess
they're looking for
I used to say this when I was a Christian
I'm looking for a demon under every rock
they're looking for bad faith actors under every rock
and I guess what Peter
is doing
or what any anything
not just Peter but anyone doing that kind of
that kind of having conversations
about trans issues on campus
people associate
you maybe with Steven Crowders
you know change my mind kind of things
or Ben Shapiro's
conversation
not Ben Shapiro's who was that person
who released that documentary what is a woman
Matt Walsh
they're just associating those conversations
with like the alt right
so they're like very
protective against I guess
the transgender community that's being hurt by these things
I can empathize with that
although
I wish they were more open
to conversation
because
less of the immediate
strategy of just denouncing
and calling names
and that dominance
at least we open the conversation
a little bit
I was talking to Shannon Q about this when she was on
and it seems as though
I worry
see this is what I worry about
because I'm pretty progressive
in my social politics
and
kind of centrist in my economic politics
but I'm also a dummy
comes to politics and sociology so I have no idea
but what I find
frustrating is
that there are so many bad faith actors
wanting to engage in these conversations
about transgender issues
that what happens is
they'll come to a conversation
wanting to ask a serious question
like
maybe like
isn't gender just what's in your pants
or something like that
and someone may have that
as a genuine question
and they're seriously considering it because
someone's told them or thought this
but they're indistinguishable
from a bad faith actor
so they're treated with
this
aggression
from the left
from
allies of the transgender community
and as a result
they're like screamed at by someone with blue hair
and then
they turn around like oh I was just trying to ask a serious question
and then the old writer there
with their open arms saying told you
those crazy feminist lefties
you know they're all crazy
and they're there with open arms
working them in wheat we've got your brother
do you know also that the Jews control the media
and do you know also that
so it's I worry that there's a shift happening there
but then at the same time
I think that
it's kind of dog shit
that the transgender community
and like the LGBT community
like lesbians gays like
have to fight so hard just for things like
being able to marry
or you know
like they have to like
they have to like justify
their existence all the time
nine times out of ten when someone comes to them
with a question like
isn't gender just spots in your pants
or just something like that
it is bad faith actors it's someone who's watched
too much Ben Shapiro
and they think they've got like the own on trans
people and then they want to like
kind of attack them over it
so yeah it's a massive situation
I don't know if there's an answer to how to resolve it
but I agree with you
it'd be nice if people could engage
in the conversation more critically
but I also think that
and this is just my personal opinion
that
unfortunately it's hard to do that
when there are so many bad faith actors
at the moment on either side
what do you think?
it's hard I think it's just better
not to see not to view
demographic
populations as political
contingents
or parties
or like there is
never
the transgender community
is a
it's a demographic population
not a political
coalition
there is a
diverse viewpoint
from this whole
set of people in this
immediately characteristic population
potentially
and
I'm sure
if we had
a random sampling of like 10 people
from that population
and put them in front of the spectrum game
with the claim there are only two genders on it
I would love to see
how that
turns out would they all be on one line?
I doubt it
what reasons would they have
to be on the different lines
and
people
that would be great to see
if people are
one way or the other
people need to be persuaded
not shamed into their beliefs
and hearing people out
and their reasons
especially if they are in that
population
that would be great to see
interesting
people need to be persuaded not shamed
interesting thought
like gay marriage
people were persuaded
for reasons
through a liberal process
people were talking to each other
and making arguments
and that
media movies and TV shows
that helped along
but ultimately
someone who was gay
and an activist could
talk with someone
and that person could then take on that argument
and persuade other people
about it
they don't need to have
the characteristic themselves
to have the moral argument for it
it's funny
I have a graduate certificate
a degree in marketing
and so I view everything as brands
so for me
there's a transgender brand
there's an LGBT brand
there's a white brand
there's a black brand
there's a
one of the biggest brands
that is out there
is natural slash organic
that's a big brand
in
university
people
they're sticky beliefs
so when someone subscribes
one part of natural or organic
they're like
I get organic stuff from
the fruit market
then they stick themselves
to the I like organic natural brand
and then that encompasses all these other beliefs
that they don't necessarily think too much about
but
they subscribe to
so when someone tells them
vaccines aren't natural
they go oh maybe vaccines aren't good
and they have a
social of themselves with this like brand
and I think that
for the gay marriage thing
I think the brand of
this sounds horrible to talk about human beings
like this but I think this is how
social species work
they view things in a certain way
there was enough work in media
in
the discourse
in liberal
ideologies
that let that brand
of
the gay brand I guess
be popular enough that people were okay with it
that the majority who weren't
LGBT were okay with it
and I feel like
the transgender community have got a long way to go still
in that regards
because I think they're just people who want to live
live like everyone else
and not be
questioned about their identity
yeah
there's the fundamental
issue of do we want to
imbue
these immutable characteristics with
meaning or
we remove the meaning
from these things
I think brown eyes
has no meaning
you wouldn't care
about the
distribution
of people with brown eyes in your workplace
and we want the same thing
for brown skin
eventually in my mind that's the liberal
mindset
we want to
remove the social significance
of these things
not bolster them
not make them brands
in my mind
oh I don't think
it's not a prescription
the brands isn't a prescription
I need to clarify that just the same way
survival of efficiency isn't a prescription
I'm more talking about it as the way people view things
the way people who don't think
about things too much find favor
or don't find favor with certain things
Nazis become a brand
the word Nazis become almost
amorphous doesn't mean anything because it's been used
so much
for things that aren't
to do with the Nazis
so
someone disagrees though
with you
I disagree in Australia it was a fact that our neighbors
in particular New Zealand shamed our government
into having a vote
for us
a vote and he
what having
I guess it's a gay vote half of us always supported it
so he's saying that
the New Zealand government shamed the Australian government
into having a plebiscite
so the plebiscite was like a mail out
mail out ballot
to see if people supported the same sex marriage
I don't know if you call that shame
they shamed the institution
to have a mail in ballot
or something
a vote
I guess that would work on an institutional level
but I don't know
I don't think you can shame someone
into changing their belief
because they're not changing their belief
they're not changing what they're convinced of
they're just being pushed into the other
usually being pushed into the other side
of things
everyone's surprised
who's that guy
Karl Rittenhouse
who killed those people in those protests
everyone's surprised
that he's now hanging out with old riders
I'm not surprised
you see the way he was
vilified by the left
of course he's going to like
be pushed further into the right
same with Jordan Peterson
in my opinion at the moment
Jordan Peterson is essentially a partisan hack
but that's only because of the way
the left is treated
in my opinion I could be wrong
I haven't looked into it
don't quote me on that
but it just seems that way
anyway
let's jump back
let's roll things back a little bit
I've got a question
if you're doing SE
with a racist
what factors do you look for
to see if they're looking for honest dialect
or if they're ignorant and won't change their minds
if they're an honest actor
really SE applies to bad faith
or good faith
you're mainly asking questions
you're not trying to give them an argument
SE works
fairly well with trolls
because you're repeating back
and getting clarity on the logic
and even if someone's trolling
you still just go through the argument
and get clarity on it
and critically think about it
but if people are watching
that could be
potentially beneficial
but if they're bad faith
you just kind of
say
I don't think this is honest
I'd like to have
an honest conversation
so
I'm going to
move on now
something like that
we did a review of a conversation I had
with a racist person
I remember
I'm sure you remember as well
and
that turned into an absolute
shit show by the end
where he eventually
kept commenting on my channel
over 10 times like debate me
and I said okay I will every time
jump on my discord I'll debate you anytime
and then I basically just put out a hit piece
on him
totally non SE
and then we got into a screaming match
where I just laughed and it was the most satisfying thing ever
and I had like a really big conflict
because I wanted to make SE style videos
and I also wanted to be able to yell at racist online
because both of them
were equally as enjoyable to me
so my branding is a little bit confused with my channel
so
last question
and I like to ask this to everyone
unless someone asks another question
to ask but
what is the most plausibly true religion
you don't believe in
I'm not that familiar with
most religions
I guess Buddhism
everyone says Buddhism
because it's
there's not much
you know there's not much empirical baggage there
that's problematic
okay there might have been a guy
that started it
but the commitments
to it
are not that bad
and it also just seems to work
psychologically
for a lot of people
so that helps
yeah what about like the karma
the dharma the reincarnation
the
the infinite lives
until you become enlightened is that all
yeah that's not
that's not madio
it's a hard question isn't it
because
I've asked
Christians this
it's an interesting question
because it gets you to evaluate other beliefs
yeah
great gods
great gods really
god Zeus
I mean there's just a plurality
of gods and
that explains potentially
weird bad stuff that's happening
you know random natural disasters
I don't know
who knows
yeah I don't know either
I think maybe
I'm probably Buddhism but maybe
nothing about Shintoism could be cool
like Shintoism could like they have like
you know they have like nine gods of rice
so there's like a life force in everything
like everything has a life force
and so I guess that
could be accurate and maybe that's
the dark matter that we can't detect
in the world in the universe or something
I don't know
but it's
it's stepping out of the realm of faith
into the realm of
science
like evaluating the ideas
you ask that question
well read thank you so much for coming
on deep drinks podcast it's been a blast
this is now going to be my pool
so I drink
this is delicious in fact
we bought a block pool
it's just coming into somewhere
late spring here in Australia so
we're just going to sit in the backyard pool
with these drinks me and my wife
and have a great
Sunday afternoon so thank you so much for coming
on it's been fascinating talking
to you especially about
the transgender stuff that's I think there's
could have been a whole other conversation there
but is there anything else you want
to say before we wrap up
no this was great
love it thanks Dave
awesome see you later guys
you
