This is something that only my friends on Patreon know about, but people who read the paper on a
very specific day in late 2016, I think, also knew because I was on the front page because of it.
So yeah, so I went to, you know, evangelical Christian school. We had a large cafeteria
and the way that our meal plans worked is, you know, in your tuition, you have to purchase a
meal plan if you live on campus. So that meant that everyone paid in a specific amount of money.
You could either spend that money by going to the cafeteria and eating there, like during the
regular meal times, and you can spend it by buying things that like coffee shops and like little
burrito stands and stuff we had around the campus. So we all had this this meal plan money and part
of it is what we called flex cash. That's the coffee and burrito money. A lot of people were like me
and they didn't really do, they don't don't drink coffee. They don't really go and get all these
like extra things they eat at their meal times. And so their flex cash was just like like a thousand
dollars just sitting there doing absolutely nothing at the end of the semester. And so a lot of the
time what we would do is like go to these places and buy like a hundred burritos and then go that
and like throw them at people around campus just completely wasting the food. And you know, there
were traditions about this on campus. We got apples and threw them at certain buildings. It was it was
fun. But I thought one day like we're literally getting this food when and throwing it at each
other or just like stuffing ourselves needlessly during finals week when we have a homeless
homelessness epidemic horrible crisis in the city. Like maybe me and my friends could buy a bunch of
food and we could just drive it into the place places like downtown where there are more homeless
people and just give us give them pizza or burritos or whatever. I thought like there's got to be a
better way to deliver it to more people than that. So I started looking into different organizations
like nonprofits in the area that dealt with homelessness that my university was connected to
and I found one and I was like okay like they serve hundreds of people they have tons of beds.
They have a massive freezer that can fit tons and tons and tons of food and they're in need of some
very specific food items. So I like I talked to the homeless shelter they told me what they needed
and then I think you could probably tell I was in my senior year here and I like I kind of knew
what I was doing. Like I had some some service project experience and I was pretty confident in
the way that I carried myself and I realized that the money at the end of the semester that we were
just wasting or we weren't spending was going to someone and I figured that was probably the
the cafeteria the catering company and let's be realistic it's not going to the workers that
are like making our food every day they're paid an hourly wage it's going to the top people right
like it's going to their CEO it's going to their managers that they're getting Christmas bonuses and
all this they don't even need and I was like they're not going to want to give this up but
if I can convince them that they will look really good without actually losing very much of this
money then maybe I can trick them into into allowing me to have a sign-up sheet that they have
legally signed to allow me to do this where students can walk into the cafeteria I have a booth
and they like the student comes up and I'm like hey you can give your flex money here and we're
going to donate it to such and such mission so that they can buy food for their for their people
at the shelter and you know like it sounds obvious like there's a lot of students that
are going to do this it's going to be thousands of dollars it did end up being over eight thousand
dollars but I didn't want the cafeteria people to realize how big it was going to be uh so I would
like schedule a meeting where I purposely misspelled things in the email like with the manager of the
cafeteria and be like you know hey like I have never really done this kind of thing before but
can I have like a meeting with you and then I'd show up like a little bit late to look like an
amateur you know that wasn't really serious and then I would like purposely make my voice high
pitched and and just act like I had no clue what I was doing and be like yeah so like some of my
friends like we just you know we just want to be able to give like some of the food to the homeless
people around and we just figured like we probably do like a couple hundred dollars like I would my
dream is to donate a thousand dollars it would be so crazy and and I would love to be able to say
you know like if you help me with this I'm going to get up in chapel and like thank the cafeteria
for saying for for doing this and she's like all right like the cafeteria was widely hated and that
manager was widely hated on campus people hated her and her staff hated her too uh and so she's
like this looks like good PR and this kid has no idea what he's doing so there's no way he's going
to raise real money and so I get her to sign a statement that's like I'm going to let Drew do this
I table every single day even get all my friends to like table like
anytime the cafeteria is open and when I'm in class whatever and we get people to sign over over
eight thousand dollars worth of this money which probably would have been mostly going to her and
a couple of her buddies and then I'm like all right I got to make sure that the exchange here
there's a there's a there's an exchange of power that goes smoothly here yeah and so when she like
hands me the check I need god I sound like an asshole uh I need witnesses and so I called the
the city paper um and I was like hey this just happened and I got like a media rep from my school
to back me up that this had happened and so we got like a reporter there with the camera to
photograph the check being handed over she's like covering her face doing this and so they
didn't use that paper they didn't use that photo but they used a photo of me like holding up like
my student ID and being like you know we just got like eight thousand dollars you know stolen
from our school basically or you know charitably donated by our school to give to a homeless shelter
and uh yeah I mean when when there's a reporter there she wasn't going to not hand me the check
right yeah she was gonna look horrible so that's how I got this person to hand over her Christmas
bonus basically to a homeless reporter so that we could buy ham for a bunch of homeless people
in in our area and uh the cherry on the top is yeah yeah I mean we I think that we bought
like over five thousand dollars worth of ham um to put in their freezer and like me and a bunch
of my buddies that did this just they're like we have too much ham can can you guys help us load
the ham into our freezer and we're like yeah we'll do it um and I got to know some of the people
the shelter through doing this and like I really like them I think that they liked me and as soon
as I graduated I told them I graduated and they're like we're gonna look for a job for you because
we don't want you to work for us so that is how I got my first job out of college was by stealing
from the people at my school to give to the homeless shelter oh man so oh do you think if they if you
didn't have like the reporters and everyone there that she wouldn't have handled over the money or
like I don't know she's not sure I don't know it's like it would have really been against
her best judgment to do that because even if it's just students saw her do that like because you
would have been bad downplayed it so it it made it seem like it's I think it'll be like a couple
hundred dollars maybe a thousand dollars and then you kind of had all these signatures essentially
and you're like this is how much we need it yeah it's basically there's a sign-up sheet that I like
I present her at the end of the semester hey this is the money that you agreed to take out of your
bank account and give to the shelter for food wow and I remember I just remember seeing the figure
and being like okay sure like she the paper the paper the news journal actually reached out to
her for comment about it and it says in the paper like such and such did did not you know give any
comment
