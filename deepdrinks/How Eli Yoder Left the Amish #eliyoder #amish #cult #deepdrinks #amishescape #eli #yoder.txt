There's where I met my buddy that was willing to help me leave the Amish because I would
always go and speak with him about my problems and let him know when I was in upper teenage
years and then that's how I really was able to escape because if it wasn't for anybody
willing outside the Amish to help me and plan my escape, there was just no way that.
And that's also one of the reasons why there's very few women that leave out of my Amish
community because the women are not out in the workforce.
The women are in the house, they're cooking, they're cleaning.
All of our clothes were homemade.
They made all of our clothes and so cooking, canning, the vegetables, gardening, all of
that stuff.
So, the women really don't have that opportunity if they ever had thoughts that may be leaving
and that's why my community, I'd say there's over a hundred guys now left and one female
so far.
