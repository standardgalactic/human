It just took 30 years before I was brave enough or smart enough or I don't know exactly what
the tipping point was.
Well, I do know the tipping point.
It was having children.
And I just remember having a real moment of pause that was like, I've accepted a lot of
apologist answers.
I've accepted a lot of excuses.
What I feel comfortable though, explaining these excuses, being the person that's now
giving them to my kids as they come up.
