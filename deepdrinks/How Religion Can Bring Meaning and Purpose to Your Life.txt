And so there are a lot of people who are committed,
religious, not because they are wholly committed
to the truth claims, but because they're committed
to all the other aspects of it.
That's bring meaning into their lives,
help them find purpose, help them find a sense of community,
help them get out of bed every day
and hopefully go help people.
But when people get caught up in the identity markers
and the boundary maintenance and the structuring of power
and values too often that results
in getting out of the bed every day to go hurt other people
just to advance their own interests.
And so religion is like anything else.
It's like language.
It's like countries.
It's like law enforcement.
