85% or something, not about Russia.
So news coverage, news media sources,
they covered Ukraine in the most like false way possible
and fear-mongering always,
all the time about Nazis and shit.
And they also talked about how West supports this like coup
and which some people still call it not a revolution,
but you know, like,
and also talk about gay people for some reason.
And I was like, 80% or 5% of your coverage on TV
is not about your country.
Is nothing going on in Russia.
The worst covering, no problems, no issues,
no like, you know, like anything you just talk about
the West and Ukraine and gays, that's about it.
