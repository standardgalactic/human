When I was working through it logically,
I knew in my mind this wasn't washing,
but emotionally I was behind because I'm like,
oh my God, I don't want to go to hell.
What happens if I'm wrong?
That's natural.
Allow that to happen.
If you move your mind forward and ask the questions,
your heart, I believe, will follow.
It takes a while.
I think you surround yourself with other people
who are also questioners, who are curious,
who are critical and unafraid to be so.
And give yourself time and grace.
Don't punish yourself.
If you don't know, say I don't know.
And just take it one day at a time.
Take a deep breath, move forward,
commit yourself to trying to figure it out.
And I make the same commitment
that I think anybody should make.
If there is evidence for a God somewhere
that I discover tomorrow, I would want to know that.
That's what an honest life looks like.
