Welcome to Deep Drinks Podcast
where the drinks are deep and the conversations
are deeper.

Hey everybody, welcome to a very special episode of Deep Drinks Podcast.
I finally convinced my wife,
my beautiful queen of a wife,
to come on to Deep Drinks.
She's very nervous.
Apple Watch is telling her her heart rate is up high.
So it's a very personal
subject for both of us.
Thank you so much for coming out and saying hello.
Please be kind in the comments.
We will ban anyone who is trying to troll.
We're happy to take any good faith questions.

people are actually listening to it on Spotify.
So I get the analytics in the background,
but yeah, so many people are enjoying the podcast
and given a go, I have some friends
who are actually listening to it from the start,
which is, I hope my interviewing skills
have gotten better over time.
A few episodes I really like is Hailey Brook,
Hidden Queens, great episode as well.
I love Thomas Westbrook, Holly Cooley,
that was a really fun episode.
Derek is heartbreaking and crazy episode.
Derek will be coming on again soon as well.
And Nurek Khan, my recent favorite episode,
Leaving Islam last week's episode,
it was just, it was something else.
It was really incredible.
So with that said, I'm going to introduce
my lovely, beautiful goddess of a wife, Amy McDonald.
Amy is a beautiful, kind queen
of the McDonald household.
Amy and I have been married for eight years
and I've been doing fertility treatment for five years.
In that time, Amy and I have both experienced
the many lows of that process
and experienced many unexpected emotional tolls,
which we will touch on today.
So with that said, welcome to my beautiful wife,
Amy McDonald.
Yay, we need like-
Oh, I just casually sit down.
Yeah, we need like some fun, cheery music or something.
Yeah, so, yeah, what are we drinking, babe?
Well, because I'm pregnant, I can't drink alcohol,
which is very sad.
Otherwise I'd be drinking gin.
But a non-alcoholic beer, heaps normal.
Heaps normal.
Oh, look, the color grading has turned the white like green.
That's funny.
So let's get them poured.
So even though it's 10 a.m., we're drinking non-alcoholic beer.
Yeah, so it's fine.
Yeah, it's just Australian culture.
But, and give us some grace as we warm up here,
because this is quite a personal subject,
as you might imagine.
I didn't imagine that it was,
like fertility treatment was so personal
until we went through it ourselves, like so harsh
until we went through it ourselves.
Did you always think it was a personal subject?
Yes, yeah, yeah, definitely.
Because I don't know, you have a lot of people continuously
asking like, oh, you guys have been married
for like X amount of years now,
are you guys gonna start family and all that stuff?
So there's like a lot of pressure
from like the outside already,
just to hurry up and have kids
and people just don't know what's going on.
Yeah, so it is quite personal.
Yeah, and just before,
I forgot to mention this to you before babe,
but we can see people's comments pop up,
so you can read them out if you like.
So Aaron said,
Jen tastes like drinking a pine tree.
Well, I don't know what gin you're drinking,
but definitely not.
I like pine trees.
And also, something I forgot to mention,
and this episode is off the cuff,
we decided to do it last minute, I convinced Amy,
but, and you can hear our dog growling in the background.
But last week, we actually got close to our goal
of getting to a thousand subscribers,
where we're going to be doing a charity stream.
I might have been able to convince you
to come on the charity stream.
Oh, a new guest, oh, agnostic Amy.
So, so yeah, we've gone from this to,
we're now at 30% of the way there, 300 subscribers.
So that is awesome.
And our dog is going crazy.
We lost a ball underneath your bookshelf.
Okay.
So,
Manny, come on, you're disturbing the stream.
You want to join in?
Come on, come on, come on.
I'm gonna be up too high for him.
So, so yeah, this is our dog, Manny.
He was, he's our second beta child.
We lost our first child last year, which was unfortunate.
Yeah.
But yeah.
So, let's put him down.
So, babe, do you want to talk us,
do you want to talk us through the process
of what IUI and IVF look like for you, Manny?
Starting from where exactly, after what?
Like, when did you start thinking
that we might need to go through IVF or IUI?
So I remember, I remember you wanted me to go get tested
because we stopped having, we stopped using protection.
Yeah, well, but I always,
I always strongly believed that I had endometriosis.
Just because of growing up, my mum had it
and yeah, every month was quite painful and stuff.
So I always kind of suspected that I did.
And I knew that that can potentially stop you
from falling pregnant.
But as I was researching it,
they're all saying like, oh, well, you got to wait a year
before you start getting tested as partners
and they test the male first because it's a lot easier
to test you to see if there's any issues with you
before they turn to me.
I'm sorry, I was trying to jumpstart on that.
I wonder if it's appropriate for me to tell the story
of when I got my sperm tested?
What do you think?
Go for it.
Okay, so, oh, we have Tang Gang in the comments.
Hey, Tang Gang and River City Films.
Are you guys are hot?
Do you know who that is?
No.
That's Josh.
Oh.
So, thanks Josh and thanks Tang Gang.
Thanks Ultimate Debate Championship in Aaron
for showing up.
So, how many, so I'm just stretching this guys.
You won't see the tension.
So, when I first, when you got asked me
to get my sperm tested, I called up the clinic
and I was like, hey, I need to get my sperm tested.
Like, how do I do this?
And they're like, well, you can do it at home
and then bring it in, but it's gotta be
within half an hour.
I was like, we don't live half an hour.
Like, that's gonna be, depending on traffic,
that's not good.
And I was like, do you have a room or anything?
And they're like, and this is,
I don't know why it's like this in Australia,
but they're like, we have a public toilet.
I'm like, a public toilet, like a public toilet.
So, I'm like, okay, this is a mess.
And this is a very team line,
but I'm gonna tell it anyway.
So, like, I'm like, all right,
I'll go use that public toilet.
I think it's like a big public toilet.
No, it's one cubicle and two urinals
with no door off the main counter of like the hospital.
So it's like just a little, like a little toilet there.
That's the only one I could find.
And I go in there and I can hear nurses and doctors
walking past and like talking and stuff.
And I'm trying to accomplish the task.
And, you know, like it was work.
I'm gonna tell you to accomplish the task
in that environment, but I did it.
And anyway, so I wrote the time
that I did it on there and everything.
And I walked out and I saw the, sorry.
And let me get the phone.
Yeah.
Just had dogs lost his ball.
Yes, it was a challenging wank, Aaron.
And, oh, he's got beans.
So, yeah, so I'm like panicking.
Like I come out of there, not panicking,
but like coming out of there like, you know,
just like going through the toughest,
one of the toughest alone times in my life.
And straight away, I find the doors to the clinic.
I've got to like drop it off too.
And I look at the time and it says like one minute before,
like was when I collected the sample.
And I was like, I can't walk it in there.
Like still out of breath, like, here's my sample.
Like that's just too weird.
That's freaking weird.
I'm very intimate.
Yeah, it's too intimate.
And I was like, no, I can't do this.
So I sat there on a bench for 10 minutes
just with it in my pocket, just like waiting for the profit.
Cause I didn't want them to be like,
this was in your self, like a few moments beforehand.
So I literally like went in.
And then the worst part is like when I went in,
I like dropped it off and you walk in
and it's like a science laboratory, like straight away.
There's like, there's no, I mean, this is like,
I guess it was niche.
They don't have like a consumer market or something,
but I go in and it's like, you know,
scientists comes out and there's like lab stuff
kind of everywhere and like paperwork everywhere.
And she's like, oh yeah.
And she like opens the bag and he's like looking at it.
I'm like, can you do this when I'm not here?
I'm like, this is too intimate.
Like get out.
So yeah, it was, it was horrible.
So like I left.
I'm not going to talk about it.
That's a great experience.
Oh geez.
That was, that was a, that was, that was probably,
that was probably like the toughest experience
I went through, which in retrospect is an incredible
It sounds pretty nice.
Yeah, compared to what you've gone through this whole time.
So we always make jokes that, so no joke,
it's fully real that, you know, I, Amy gets like prodded
and stabbed and things shoved up
or without her consent.
Well, I guess you do consent, but you don't want it to happen.
And then, you know, and just like people looking everywhere
and stuff.
And what I get to do is stay home from work masturbating
with no social discourse, like no,
like everyone's okay with it.
Like it's the only time in my life it's socially acceptable
to stay home from work masturbating to give a sample.
So yeah.
So this, this story is more about your story,
more about what you've gone through.
Oh, you don't want to give them the results?
Of what?
My test.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
So, oh, this is a bit, this has been intimate.
So when I, when I got my sperm,
when I got my sperm tests sorted,
oh, you, the doctor said to me,
when I come in to like test my sperm, he goes,
mate, is like, you should be,
he's like, to be normal, consider normal,
you should have, I can't remember what the numbers were,
but he's like, you should have a number of like 50.
And he's like, you're 84.
I'm like, oh, and he's like, and he's like the amount.
He's like, you should be, you know, this, but you're 142.
Like it was just like way over.
Like I was blowing records.
Like it was crazy.
And, and he was like, he's like,
you need to hang this on your fridge.
And I think I did.
You did.
No, I hang the, I hang the test sample on the fridge.
I'm like, yeah.
No, the report.
Not the sample.
The report, not the sample.
Yeah.
So Tom Nagel said, what does it taste like?
That's not a troll for my mods.
It's one of my dearest friends.
So yeah, it was, it was, you know, it was an experience,
but how does this beer smell bad, eh?
Yeah, it's good.
For non-alcoholic.
Yeah.
Tastes like beer.
You've missed beer.
Yeah.
I've just missed alcohol in general.
Yeah.
So, I guess we can go through, like so,
so I guess we can go through the process of like
trying IUI
and like our attempts at that.
Or like, can you give the people a rundown
of like what you went through?
Yeah.
Or just trying to work out where to start from.
So.
Start from wherever you like.
Steep drinks.
We,
we,
oh, we ended up,
like I ended up having like a bunch of scans and stuff.
And then they thought that, yes,
they could see that I had quite large,
quite serious endometriosis.
And so we,
yeah, we had to go through quite a while
of being on different hormone treatment and stuff
because it's quite large to help bring it down
before they could operate.
And yeah, so we did,
I don't know if that was like six months or something.
And then,
and then we did,
yeah, then we had the operation
and had to go in two weeks later for a follow-up.
And yeah, we just kind of kept getting knockbacks
after knockbacks.
Like we,
I think by the end,
I ended up having four surgeries to try
and get rid of this endo
just so that we could start either IUI or IVF.
And that really spanned out over,
I don't know, like three years maybe?
Yeah.
And this is like a costly thing too.
Cause in Australia, we don't,
everything's covered.
Most things covered with just the public system
with health,
but with IVF and IUI fertility treatment,
it's not,
you have to get private health insurance to cover.
You don't have to,
you can just pay for it out of pocket.
But it was something like $43 a week
for paying for private health insurance.
Just for a year,
you have to do it for a year
before you start getting surgeries and stuff.
And then they give you a certain amount off.
Yeah.
But even with that,
we still,
I think it was still like five grand or something
just to do the first,
the first surgery.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Cause that was,
that was the big one.
Cause I had to stay overnight in hospital and stuff.
When you came out,
they had connected,
they had like taped,
not taped,
tied something to like your belly button or something.
Or something,
they tied something inside.
Oh my,
they popped.
My ovary was stuck to,
my bladder or something like that.
And so they had to,
they had to like cut the endo to separate them.
And then tie my ovary back up to my stomach
and stitch it there.
So that it would stay there
and keep it there for a week
before I could go get stitches out.
So I couldn't stand up straight for a week.
And I was like hobbling around the house.
She was like,
staying over like this,
like literally like an almost 90 degree angle
and walking like tiny little folks.
I got these cool videos over it.
I love that,
like people commented like,
I love that you're not helping your wife,
you're filming her and laughing
as she's like all drugged up,
trying to walk back to the house.
Yeah.
As some of them have problems with empathy,
I guess,
or maybe I don't know.
No, you don't.
And you're just like filming stuff.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
So that like,
we went through a bunch of them
and they were,
you know,
they were unsuccessful.
But what they,
what they did is they,
the actual process value wise is quite interesting.
So what's the value I stand for?
Oh, I actually can't remember.
Give us the scientific definitions of everything, please.
No, thank you.
I was like,
I don't know much about IVF.
What are the people going to quiz you on?
No one's going to quiz you
on like scientific meanings and stuff.
Yeah.
No, I can't remember,
but pretty much,
pretty much they put me on some drugs
and
keep scanning me every couple of days
to see where my
ovulation is at.
And the eggs that
ripen in how big they get in
before they release.
And then when it gets to like a stage
that they're happy with,
they,
they get me,
they give me a trigger shot,
which causes my body to ovulate.
And then they get Dave to do his thing
and bring back another cup.
Yeah.
And,
and yeah, then they,
then they pretty much put that in me
at a very, very specific time.
Yeah.
So that's IUI.
They like take my,
my sperm and like,
whiz it round in a centrifuge.
And all the dead or weak sperm moves to one side
and all the strong sperm
like stick up to one side.
Then they like take the strong sperm
and then they chemically treat it to like boost it,
make it like jack sperm.
And then they,
they open up Amy with a speculum
and then they go,
and then they see a service here
and stick it right on the cervix.
And I asked the doctor,
I was like,
I love your descriptions of everything.
And I asked the doctor,
I was like,
do we,
I was like,
do you guys sell these speculums?
And he was like,
oh no,
we'll give you someone a gift bag.
And Amy's like laughing,
and I head off.
Jerk, obviously.
We did not have one of those.
Yeah.
I had to buy it online.
Oh, whatever, stop it.
It's any good for me.
So you can look inside.
No.
Gross.
Gross.
Um,
separate the weak from the strong,
and I said,
yes, that's true.
So,
yeah, so,
Oh yeah.
So then we had,
then we had the two week wait
to then find out
if it actually worked or not.
And I'm filming.
And we're like,
oh, and then like,
the dog comes in and you're like,
it didn't work.
I still got the footage of us,
just.
Oh, and do you?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't remember you taking that.
Oh yeah.
I'm always filming something.
There's a camera back there.
No, I'm kidding.
Um, yeah.
So that one didn't work.
And then we'll like,
oh, okay, we'll,
we'll,
we'll try again.
Cause our specialist was like,
we've got the majority of the endo.
It's all good.
You guys are still quite young.
Like there's nothing else going on.
We should be like,
still have like,
I think it's like a 20% chance
through the IUI.
20% per.
Yeah.
So he's like,
oh, if you guys want to,
we can go again.
And so we decided to,
and then went through the same process again.
And I can't remember if we did it two times or three times.
I have no idea.
I can't remember if we did it twice or three times,
but we,
anyway, some of them didn't work.
And then,
and then when we went to go do it either the second time
or the third time,
they were scanning,
they were scanning me and realized that I had,
from all the drugs,
like a boost in my estrogen and stuff,
it actually caused a cyst.
That's right.
Yeah.
And so they actually went in while I was awake
with like a needle and stuff
and drained the cyst right there.
I forgot about that.
That's so gross.
Yeah.
When we were there.
And then because of that,
then we had to wait again for a while before we could do
another one.
And then my endo came back just because of all of the drugs
that we'll take in.
So we had to do another surgery.
Nidibus actually said this,
babe, you want to read it out?
Which one?
Yeah, this is how you get McDonald's.
Oh, wow.
Very different kind of McDonald's.
Yeah.
So, before we move into,
like, so you're pregnant now.
Yes.
How far along are we?
24 weeks.
24 weeks.
That's very exciting.
I think we've actually had like five and a half months
or something.
That's super exciting.
Yeah.
We've only got 16 weeks left.
That's super stressful.
That's scary.
I don't even feel like you're pregnant.
I just like, it just.
I just have this like.
When you bring home baby clothes, I'm like,
what?
Like it freaks me out.
I'm like, oh, there's a baby in there and it's gross.
Like, it's just not gross, but it freaks me out.
But yeah, but before we did the IVF stuff,
like it was like, like, so I have this joke
and that was Amy wants four kids.
I want zero.
So we're going to meet at the middle of two,
which is in the middle.
That's part of the joke.
And also the joke is I don't want kids.
I have grown to want kids.
But I was, for a while, I was like, take or leave it.
But now I'm really stoked for kids.
But I, you're, you've always wanted kids.
Like you're insane in a little bit with kids.
Like when we used to go to church,
you used to run the J juniors, Jesus juniors,
which was about the age group.
Three to six or three to five.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember helping out down there
before we were dating.
And one of the kids, I think it was the young Will,
thought it was fun to try and sackwack me
and like got all the kids to try and sack.
And it was not a good time.
It was a great time.
I'm surprised I could give you such a good sample of it.
I'm changing it.
But yeah.
So yeah, that was, that was good.
And you know, we read them stories and stuff
and had like face painting things.
We should have photos of it come up.
We don't have any on hand, but yeah, it was really good.
But you've always been really into the children.
And it's been such an important part for you.
So I never, I can never relate to the stresses
that you went through dealing with that.
Yeah.
Well, it is, I don't know.
You kind of put more pressure on yourself almost
because it's something,
it's something that I had always, always wanted.
And wanted like a medium to large size family.
Sorry to start thinking that that might not possibly happen.
Or not that it might not happen,
but more that it might not happen like the way
that I thought like, I don't know.
You get, you get, when you're growing up,
like and like in sex ed and stuff,
you're pretty much told like all it takes is one time
to have sex before pregnant, which is true.
However, there are also people out there like me
and others who have different complications and stuff
that it's actually a lot harder than that.
And so to grow up thinking that,
oh, it's super easy to fall pregnant.
And then to hit all these roadblocks and stuff
is really just encouraging.
Yeah.
And, and it's hard to because people don't realize
like the emotional toll it takes when you see a friend
who is, has fallen pregnant
and you've got these conflicting emotions
where you're happy for them, but you're super jealous.
And it's a reminder of yourself
and your troubles and stuff.
And it's like this conflicting feeling
because you don't want to feel upset
or you don't want it to make it about you,
but you can't help it because it's so raw.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know if I would use the word, it's hard.
I don't know if I'd use the word jealous,
but it's definitely, it definitely feels like for me anyway,
it would feel like a slap in the face almost.
Not, not from them personally, just like the situation.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, I don't know.
I feel like everyone goes through stages where like,
all your friends around you, like getting engaged
and getting married.
And then the next stage is like,
all your friends and family are like getting pregnant
and stuff around you.
And so, yeah, I don't know, having that, it's just,
I don't know, you go, yeah, you go through stages of emotions
and you'll finally become like, okay,
with what's going on,
like a little bit more mentally stable.
And then someone else will announce that they're pregnant.
And then it just, I don't know,
it just brings all those emotions back up and stuff.
No fault to the person who has the amazing news
that they're pregnant.
But it's just, yeah, it just brings it straight back
into your face, kind of.
And I didn't, hey, Mr. Bootleg,
I didn't realize like the depths of the despair
until I think it was one night,
we were coming back from a party.
You would drink, you had been drinking.
I'm not sure if you'd been drinking too much.
Or maybe you hadn't been drinking.
I think you'd been drinking.
I think I was.
We were driving and you were having a conversation
and you just broke down screaming,
screaming crying, whatever that is.
Like not like screaming at me,
but you were just like,
and I was like, whoa,
I could feel like the depths of your non-existent soul
just in that, not saying you don't have a soul,
I don't think I don't believe in souls.
But you know, I could feel like a deeper,
you know, a deeper like a trauma there.
And I didn't, and I was like, whoa.
And I remember, I don't know if it was then,
it probably wasn't then, it was probably some other time,
but I said, I said like, hey, like,
like I've never been a huge, huge person for kids.
Like it's like, if you decided like, no,
and I want kids, I want to travel Europe
and do whatever for the rest of their lives,
I was like, okay, like, cool, whatever.
There's benefits to that as well.
And, but at that moment, I ran out of time,
I was like, okay, well, like,
if this is this important to you,
then we're gonna have, we're gonna have kids.
Like I immediately became, like it wasn't an issue.
And it wasn't like, and I was like, if we can't,
if we can't, if IUI doesn't work, we'll try IVF.
If IVF doesn't work, like, I don't care the prices.
If IVF doesn't work, then we'll, we can try surrogacy.
If surrogacy doesn't work, then we can try and adopt.
If adopting doesn't work, we can move to Africa
and adopt an orphanage.
Either way, you're gonna have children in your life.
Yeah, and I do remember you saying that,
and that did make me feel a little bit better,
because then I was like, oh, okay, well,
like we will one day end up having kids,
which is, which was the ideal goal.
But it still felt,
didn't, it didn't feel the same for me
because I always wanted to be pregnant.
I always wanted to have the experience
of going through pregnancy and stuff.
And so if we did have to go down that route
of adopting or surrogacy or something else,
then that part was kind of getting taken away from me,
which was also sad in another aspect.
I mean, you also want to get married and pregnant in 21.
I wanted to be pregnant in 21, yeah.
I think that was more-
Church chicks, am I right?
Following in my family's footsteps.
I don't know, my mom had me when she was 21,
so I was like, oh, that's fine.
And I always wanted kids, so I was like, that's not a problem.
Yeah, yeah, there's, yeah, and like,
but forget, just for me, like I was like,
because our relationship's quite special in that.
I think that we do a couple of things really well.
We're not perfect, but we do a couple of things
really well in our relationship.
And I think it comes, some of it stem from my anxiety
and just, and like, and stuff, which is like,
I guess it's gonna come from my anxiety,
but we're really honest with each other.
We talk about our feelings,
even if they might hurt the other person,
we'll be like, we'll talk about them
and we'll discuss everything.
We're open and honest with each other,
open honest with ourselves
about how we're feeling and what we're going through
and stuff, and we respect each other.
So, you know, like that.
But then the other thing too is we support each other
in what we want to do.
So for me, I like being creative.
So, you know, I used to work on video games
and you'd support me and I'd just disappear into,
I'd say, oh, there's a game Jamon this week
and I would disappear into the garage.
I'd even bring a mattress into the garage
so I could sleep for four hours and get up
and you code a video game from start to finish
for 48 hours.
And one of my cousins, Max,
who might be watching now, probably not,
he said, he said, how do you just disappear for four days,
for two or three days and your wife is okay
with you just being in the garage playing video games?
I'm not playing video games.
This is an important thing for me.
Like this is a creative expression for it.
This is like artwork, right?
Same with like my obsession with books
or like, you know, I'm buying a book every week
and Amy's like, this is, you know, you support me
or the video is making a deep drinks, you know,
or the arguments that get on Facebook.
She's like, why do you do this to yourself?
I'm like, well, I don't really do that anymore.
Yeah, but like you, you support me
in the things that are important to me
and I try and support you in the things that are important
to you.
And even if I don't see, like for, you know,
for a while I didn't see how,
why kids were so important to you
and you obviously don't see why it's,
a lot of the things I do are important to me
but we respect each other in that, in that anyway.
I think that's what makes our relationship cool.
Cool.
Cool.
I agree.
Yeah, I love you.
Someone said, God bless Trump.
I'm wondering if that is Max.
I'm like the one that says not watching.
So one thing that we did get before,
before we go into the IVF stuff
is one thing that we got was lots of unsolicited advice.
And it was like getting to a point where
it was extremely hard for us to deal with.
Like, yeah.
Like because one, you know, a family members
and friends who we really respect and love
would tell us stuff that was conflicting.
So our IVF specialists, you know,
would ask them about the stuff
and then black tell them to go to medical school
or tell them to, you know, like this,
there's no science at all.
Would have people tell us.
Yeah, he was quite good
because he's very like black and white.
Yeah.
Our fertility specialist.
Yeah, very, very black and white.
And people would say, you know, you've got to give up soy
or soy is the problem or...
Oh, there was so many different things
but they didn't know...
They didn't know what the actual cause was.
Yeah.
They didn't realize that it was because of my endo.
Yeah.
And we had a beloved family member who, hello, Manny,
Highwayman who actually invited us to church.
And so they, what happened was
they knew we hadn't been going to church for a while
and they knew that they didn't know
where we were at in our faith and stuff.
And we, you know, it's been a few years now
since we kind of, I may stop being convinced
by the reasons for the existence of God.
They're different for both of us,
but I guess we're both at that stage.
And this person said that they were at the revivalist,
revival kind of style church meeting.
And the person said, someone got up and said,
there is someone here whose family member
is dealing with fertility stuff.
Oh, they said specifically endometriosis.
Endometriosis, yeah.
And they need to come here next week
because they'll get healed and they'll be able to have a baby,
essentially.
And this puts, you know, our family member
in a really tough position because it's awkward,
but they believe it.
And of course, and they...
And of course, if you believe what you believe,
you would definitely tell us about it, right?
So they tell us about this.
And it caused such conflict.
I don't know why, but it was,
I think it was something to do with the feelings of,
I'm just talking about myself now.
You can talk about you, but for me,
it was something about the experience of like
that old way of thinking,
that old revivalist churchy prophecy kind of way of thinking.
Yeah, that you can go somewhere,
be prayed over and get healed and fix all your problems.
Yeah.
We had, you know, I've said this before,
we had people in our church cut off their neck casts
when their neck casts, when they broke their neck.
And they were digging their nails into the neck
to prove that the neck was healed.
Like we had things like that happen.
Of course, a few days ago,
the other person went back to the hospital
with a more broken neck.
But, and we all wonder, why that happened?
But so, yeah, so there was like,
there was always stories about like people
getting healed or whatever.
And so, you know, it just,
just bringing that old way of thinking
and you think you're so desperate and you think,
what if this rational is just the devil's work or all this?
Yeah, it makes you second guess everything.
Yeah.
Because you're so desperate.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
So it's almost like, we'll try anything.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was really tough.
Yeah, and I remember like sitting,
I remember it like, it was so weird
because I was like, I don't believe it,
but for some reason it's just conflicting with me.
And, you know, I know like,
if I was a Christian listening to myself talk,
I'd be like, that was the calling of the Holy Spirit.
That was the calling of God calling.
And it's like, I don't know,
because like I feel similar things
when people tell me about like,
whatever other miracle solution they have,
miracle water or whatever of other faiths.
So, you know, like you do this, like like magic.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
But essentially, so I'm sitting in my bed
and I'm talking to our roommate, Kennedy, about this.
And I'm just like lying there.
I'm like, this is just so conflicting
because like it feels funny.
And then I was talking about it all, like all the, you know,
this is just like hard to deal with emotionally.
And I said to Kennedy, I said, would you go?
And she said, no.
And I said, why?
And she goes, because I live in reality,
I don't believe in these things.
And I was like, and like, I mean, it was harsh,
but that was her opinion.
Man, she was just listening to me
and I asked the question.
And even that didn't sway me or anything,
but what did sway me was I realized at that moment
that if God could do that to me,
if God could, and to you, sorry, to us,
if God could give us a baby, he had that power.
And I could talk to God.
I would ask God, I would say, don't use your power to do that.
Go save that starving child.
We can go through IVF.
Don't save that starving child.
Don't stop that little girl from being raped.
Don't help us with IVF.
Use your powers for something better, right?
And it's when I realized that the pure idea
that God would come to one of the wealthiest countries
on the earth with public healthcare and everything
and offer to help us with a fixable problem,
fixable with modern science,
but then let people starve, made that God out to be a monster.
But I'm not saying God's a monster.
I'm saying that idea of God is a monster.
And like, it's like watching a child drown
and then drying off the feet of another child
because they got their twitsies wet.
Save the child drowning.
The child's drowning, you know what I mean?
So for me, I was like, wow, like that really put
into perspective, if God can heal someone
or wants to heal someone, hi, Titan.
Hey, Aaron, if God wants to heal someone
of something like that,
it paints them to be like a moral monster.
And then, you know, I talk to people,
we talk to people about this and they're like,
oh yeah, I wonder how many people have,
who know someone who has endometriosis.
Endometriosis is actually very common.
Isn't it like 40% of some people?
Oh, I can't, I can't remember this.
I told you to all remember all the scientific statistics.
But it is very, very common, like.
Yeah, super common.
Yeah.
And it's also one of those things
that it's not visibly like you heal.
And then it's like, and then if someone,
it's like, let's say like, let's say 10 people,
and this is not the poo-poo,
the religion of our family, whatever,
but all the person who in violence,
because they're just doing what they,
and I love this person and everything,
but you know, if this church service,
this revival church, and I don't believe the people
that are trying to con people either,
I just believe they're also misguided,
but these prophets or preachers or whatever who say,
you know, God wants to heal some,
or heal people, let's say 10 people come,
maybe 20, it's probably 20, 30, 40 people who come
who have got intermediaries and they get healed.
39 of them cannot have a successful birth after that.
One of them can, and it can be,
and intermediaries isn't like a thing that stops, right?
Like it's not like a thing that stops pregnancy all the time.
It just reduces the rate of the chance
of being pregnant by a lot, by a huge amount, right?
So, or is that wrong?
Yes and no, it depends.
Yeah, yeah, so someone comes in with intermediaries,
they get, they have intermediaries fixed,
well not fixed, but they get pregnant after that,
and it's a miracle from God.
How can you deny the power of God?
And it's like, well, what about those other 39 people?
God wasn't talking to them, God wasn't talking to them,
but if it worked for them,
it's like God can never lose in this situation.
I'm gonna say God, I mean, the idea of God.
Like it's like, it's not, there's a great website,
I don't know if it's still up,
but it's like, why doesn't God heal amputees.com?
Or something like that, why doesn't God heal?
It's like, you never see someone's legs grow back.
I mean, there are stories of Smith and Wigglesworth,
I don't know if you'll repeat that,
but you never actually hear about that.
So, intermediaries is fixed about 10% of women globally.
Thank you, Titan.
That's interesting.
So, yeah, so that was quite hard.
We had family members asking questions
about the, like how IUI and IBF work.
And, because they're worried about souls
being created, essentially.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, do they get fertilized
and the dishes get thrown out?
And I just said, I don't know, but I also didn't care.
Like, I'm not worried about it.
Which is really nice of them to be respectful,
but it was a funny story when I did,
we had enough of unsolicited advice,
like from our friends and family who,
they're just trying to help,
but, and I remember calling up.
They don't ask first before they start doing it.
No.
They just assume that.
Yeah.
Rub garlic on your ankles for four nights a week.
Yeah.
They don't understand exactly what you're going through.
Yeah.
And a lot of them offered to pay for like stuff,
which was even harder,
because it's like they're paying for you to go to something
that you don't necessarily agree with that path.
And then like, it might be like natural healing,
which will reduce your diet and stuff or, or whatever.
And, and it's like, it's like a mental conflict
against what the actual science says,
but what our IVF specialists are saying,
people who didn't get the information from whatever.
And so, so, I'm getting drunk, sorry.
So yeah, I remember calling up.
I called up a bunch of people and it was literally like,
I remember calling up one of the worst culprits
in our friends and family.
And I said, hey, mate, you just so you know,
we're not taking any more advice.
You know, it's just very hard.
You know, people are just ridiculous.
Like, you know, pointing to other people,
like people are just ridiculous.
So we're just putting a blanket ban on all advice.
You know, we really appreciate it, but bro.
And.
It's probably a little bit different, but yeah.
Yeah.
And without breaking a beat in the conversation,
this person said, oh yeah, mate, people are ridiculous.
Like, I can't believe people giving unsolicited advice.
Anyway, that thing I was telling you about the other day,
that really works, because blah, blah, blah, blah,
and this person, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and I was like, oh, okay, we're not yet.
And he's like, yeah, I know it's just people yet.
It really works, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And I'm like, oh my, how does this happen?
How does this happen?
How does this person not understand?
Like.
I don't know if they think that they're on like a different,
yeah.
I know, like, tear to other people and be like,
oh, other people can't give advice,
but I'm different, so therefore I can.
Yeah.
And you have to, you have to too.
Like, it's like when you talk to someone about,
like, complicated, the old guy, like, I mean, equal trick.
Yeah, that's right.
The, you know, you talk to people like,
like, you know, when we have house meetings,
I'll always talk about how much I suck.
But that's not because, like, I act,
like I do suck for, like, things like cleaning and stuff.
But I'll be like, I'll be like, hey guys, you know,
we, you know, like, we'll bring out roommates again.
Like, we, you know, we've got to start cleaning and stuff.
Even though, like, the thing that's pissing you off
is might be someone else.
I'll be like, you know, I've noticed that I do X
and that X thing is what everyone else has been doing
more than me or whatever.
And I'll always point it back to me
because you want to, you want them to feel like,
yeah, Dave, you suck.
Let's pull out, let's pull out.
You want to, like, take the blame.
You don't want to, like, point the finger at someone
because then they get on their back feet.
That's the same, like, when I was calling up people,
I was like, oh, mate, you know,
when I'll call up our friends, I'm like,
oh, my family is nuts.
When I call up my family, like, my friends are just crazy.
Or I'll call up my family, like,
Amy's family just won't stop.
And then I'll call up your family, like,
and it's all true, but it's just like,
I'm just choosing what parts of the information,
like, it's kind of deceptive a little bit.
But it's like, I'm just not telling the full story
to everyone.
So, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So, yeah, there was a lot of advice coming in our way,
which made things harder.
Yeah.
Just makes it confusing and stuff.
Yeah.
Like, I ended up going and,
oh, I'm probably like halfway through this, maybe.
Actually, booking in to see a psychologist
because it was getting-
Why?
Were you nuts?
Were there any bin?
It was just getting too much for me.
Like, the run around is falling pregnant
and all the setbacks that we kept having
and the setbacks were like,
setbacks that made us wait like another six months
or a year and stuff like that.
So, they were like long setbacks.
And then all the advice coming in from other people
and stuff, it just got way too much.
Mentally.
Yeah.
And it's hard because everyone's trying to just love you.
That's the whole purpose of it.
Yeah, which also makes it hard on my end as well
because I know that that's the intention
of these people who are giving us advice and stuff.
And so, you wanna be nice and everything,
but then at the same time, you gotta, I don't know.
It's like-
How to like separate yourself from what they're saying
because you just can't.
Well, I just couldn't handle it.
It's like getting slapped across the face,
but you know, they're just trying to swat a mozzie,
but you keep getting slapped across the face
and it's like, I know there's mozzie's that were like-
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
But it still hurts.
Yeah.
So, Aaron asked,
so when you began this journey,
were you already out of church or still involved?
No, we were out of church.
Yeah, we weren't in the church,
but our families were still very much.
Yeah.
We were still very much.
If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask them.
I mean, you're allowed to give unsolicited questions,
but if we don't read them,
it means that we don't wanna answer them,
so please don't be offended.
There's some things we just-
Or we've just missed it.
Or we've just missed it, yeah.
But yeah, any questions, good faith questions are welcome,
obviously, but thank you, Aaron.
Yeah, so we're out of church.
Yeah.
It'd been a few years.
Like-
Yeah.
Yeah.
We spoke about this the last time you came on,
but do you have like an,
I can't remember, do you have like a moment
where you realize,
because the other thing about our amazing relationship
is where we're not joined at the hip in regards to like,
we can disagree on stuff.
We've been drunk in a spa with you at some hotel,
and we're like arguing about something,
but in like a friendly debate,
and you're like floating around drunk,
and I'm floating around drunk,
we're like,
and we're like arguing,
because we have different opinions,
but it's like,
we don't have to have to share the same opinion.
I don't remember that.
Yeah, you were quite drunk.
No.
But yeah, so we didn't share the same opinion,
so when you would,
I didn't know if you didn't have faith anymore,
didn't have faith, I guess,
were you no longer convinced of the idea of God,
but I definitely wasn't.
And then I started,
did you ever have like an aha moment?
I can't remember if you told me.
No.
Did you just wake up one day and you're like-
No, I just adventuated.
Yeah.
It was like you didn't think about it,
and then you're like,
did you remember when you thought and you're like,
maybe I don't believe in God?
Not particularly.
It was probably a time when you asked me.
Yeah.
Outright.
And then I think I was just like,
no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
Don't know.
Yeah.
Didn't have an aha moment.
And you don't really carry that.
That's what's so interesting.
We've talked about this before,
but Amy just doesn't seem to care.
Whatever, let's get a cheese board.
Like, I'm just like,
this affects everything.
Like, I'm a very deep thinker.
Yeah, so, yeah.
So, we went in church, we're out of church.
And, but I guess those,
regarding going back to church for that prayer and stuff,
it definitely felt very-
It definitely brought up the emotions and feelings of like,
or are we wrong?
Like, it did definitely for me.
It made me kind of reevaluate stuff, almost.
And then, because I was so desperate at the same time,
I was like, oh, well, should I just,
should I just go?
Yeah.
And then if it works, it works, great.
Yeah, exactly.
It's so weird too.
It's like a weird bribery thing.
It's like, it's a mighty fine song we've got there.
You want to come with the church?
So, but I was going to call this stream IVF when God fails,
but that was a bit too spiced.
Oh!
Yeah.
Oh my God.
But yeah, we ended up going down the route of IVF.
And so, let's tell a story about that.
Let's tell a story about IVF.
So, how much was IVF?
Did it cost us?
10 grand.
And that's after four years of $43 a week.
Plus all the.
Oh, plus all the appointments and stuff.
And the surgeries and stuff.
Yeah, probably down like 30 grand at this stage.
But we got, yeah, that's over a long time,
but we got super lucky though with our first round.
So, we went through our first round of IVF,
and it worked, which was huge news for us.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting.
No.
I thought, I was kind of trying to mentally prepare myself
for, oh, we'll probably have to do this like quite a few times.
I don't know why, but I had the number four in my head.
I was like, oh, we might have to do IVF like four times
before it actually works.
So, I was really shocked.
And if you, and if we did do it four times,
you would have thought my intuition was correct.
My intuition tells me stuff.
But now that it didn't,
you're not going to doubt your intuition.
You're just going to go, okay, it worked.
Great, that's how people get stuck into magical thinking.
But hey, everyone, thanks for joining.
I can see the numbers have just jumped up.
So, just great.
Thanks for sharing, everyone.
Thanks for sharing, Aaron.
I really appreciate it on Twitter.
So, yeah, so we had a funny story though with IVF.
So, with IVF, like it's crazy.
You're injecting yourself every day for a while.
Even that was funny in itself.
Okay, tell a story.
Let's go.
Well, I had to do a bunch of pills and stuff beforehand.
Not MDMA.
And then we had to switch over at like very specific time
into these injections.
And they caught us in
and they showed us how to do these injections.
And it was like a pen version.
So, it's like super easy to use
so that you don't have like a vial of the medication
and like put in a needle in there and drawing it up and stuff
and making sure there's no air bubbles
or anything like that.
This is like a pen that's already got everything in it.
And you just wind up the dosage and then stab it into you.
And then they showed us how to like take that needle off
and everything and it all seemed super simple.
And then we actually filmed it.
We've got it somewhere.
Oh, I wish we had that.
But, so I did the first morning
and yeah, Dave filmed it
because it was like it was the first injection of doing IVF.
And so I stabbed myself, took it out
and then tried to unscrew the needle and it was stuck.
And I was like, what am I doing this wrong?
And I was trying to unscrew it.
I imagine you shaking with your hands
because you're always so nervous about that stuff.
Yeah, I probably was.
And yeah, I think I was just so nervous doing my first one
that I accidentally screwed it on way too tight,
way, way too tight.
And so we couldn't even get it off.
And Dave tried and he couldn't get it off.
So he went to the garage and he got flyers.
Yeah, it got flyers to try and unscrew this needle
so that you could put the next one on for the next day.
Because one pen lasted you like four days.
Yeah, shut it.
Yeah, and we broke it and broke the whole pen.
And I was like, oh my gosh, I can't like our first needle
which was meant to be super easy.
And we just broke the whole thing.
And I was so embarrassed.
I had to call the clinic and be like,
we couldn't get the needle off and we broke the pen.
I kind of need another pen.
They just gave us like a new one, didn't they?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so that was quite funny.
Yeah, and then so we had this,
so we decided to go on like a little bit of a trip
and stuff like having good feelings,
good vibes and stuff, good vibes helps it.
Good vibes.
Good vibes, bro.
Helps it.
Oh, here we go.
Now I'm talking like pseudo science,
but no, it actually does.
Like no cortisone stress levels in your stressing system,
like good feelings and stuff.
Yeah, relaxing.
Yeah, so we went away on a holiday,
went down to Brisbane, stayed on Queen Street,
which was cool, did lots of shopping,
which gives you that steady drip of serotonin.
And you had to take this nasal spray.
And so do you want to tell that story?
Or you tell the first part and then I'll take over.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, so this nasal spray, it was very specific,
had to have it morning and night at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
And so it took, we took like all the injections
and the nasal spray down to Brisbane with us.
And I was taking it and yeah,
we caught up with friends one night,
or no, one, I think it was like one afternoon
or something for like a late lunch.
And I was like, oh, I don't know if we'll be back
by seven o'clock, I'll just bring the nasal spray
in my bag with me so that I can take it.
And yeah, lucky I did,
because we ended up staying out for hours and hours.
And then, so we went back to their place
and then we're like, oh, we'll catch an Uber out to,
back out to the city so we can have some dinner.
And as the Uber got there, my alarm went off
to take the nasal spray.
And so I whipped it out of my bag and I was like,
oh, just do this outside the car,
because I didn't want to get in this guy's Uber
and like be like snorting something.
Mind you, yeah, mind you,
the instructions for this were like every,
like it's okay if you're a few minutes late,
but if you're like, don't be like 30 minutes late,
you've got to be on time with the spray.
Yeah, it was very, yeah, it was very important spray.
And yeah, so I took it quickly
and I remember thinking like, oh,
there's like the safety clip on the spray wasn't there.
I couldn't find it to remove it because it was dark,
so I couldn't really see.
And I was like, oh, well,
it must have like fallen off in my bag or something.
So I took it anyway,
and then we ended up going out and having dinner
and stuff, going back to the hotel, going to bed,
got up the next morning, seven o'clock, took it again.
And then it triggered my memory about this,
the safety clip.
And I was like, oh, where is it?
It must have fallen off in my bag.
So I was rummaging through my bag
and I couldn't find it anywhere.
And then like, this is like later,
we're like a later on, I don't know what happened.
And we're getting ready to go to breakfast.
Yeah, getting ready to go for breakfast.
And I'm like, where is my hate fever spray?
And I'm like getting so angry
because I'm like, I'm like getting all congested.
I'm like, ah, hate fever spray.
And I'm like running around and Amy's like,
where do you leave it and all this stuff?
And then it clicked.
And then you looked.
Yeah.
And I looked, yeah, I looked at the spray
that I'd taken the night before and that morning
and I was like, oh my God,
I have taken your allergy, hate fever, nasal spray
and not my IVF spray.
And then I went back to the bathroom
and I saw my IVF spray.
I just put, as we were going out of the hotel
to meet with our friends, I just grabbed it quickly
and I obviously did not look very well.
And yeah, I grabbed his hate fever spray
and so I burst into tears.
Yeah. And everything we look up, it's like,
and because we're starting the process now.
So I think we would have lost like a few grand if we...
We'd already paid the 10 grand.
Yeah, but we would have like, it would have been,
we would have lost a few,
like they would have postponed it or something.
Or maybe we lost the nine grand maybe.
We...
Yeah, we didn't know.
We're not rich either.
We're not rich, like at all.
We grind hard to have what we have.
That's what we've got two people looking at us,
two borders.
So that nine grand we saved up for and we're like,
oh no, and we looked up everything online.
It's like, oh, if you're an hour late,
like it's fine, just take it.
And we're like hour late, like we missed two.
Like it's like, it's 15 hours or something.
And it's just like, everything was like,
so you've ruined your IVF.
Yeah, it was all, it was all like worst case scenario.
Like, yeah, that round's done.
You have to start again.
Yeah.
And it was the spray was to do something to change,
like to keep your body...
It was to stop me from...
Yeah, ovulating.
Because I was, because we're pumping me
like with the injections with extra estrogen
and stuff like that to get big follicles
and eggs and stuff for ripening.
They have to make sure your body doesn't ovulate early.
So you have to take this spray to stop you from ovulating.
So the fact that I had missed two lots of this spray
could have potentially meant that
I could have started ovulating
and then those eggs are just all gone.
Yeah, the ones that were boosted and everything.
So we're like, Devo, we're like,
oh, well, what a great end of the trip.
And what's funny is we stayed in that exact same hotel
like a few months back.
And when we came back, that's when we noticed
our puppy Butters had,
because he had really bad, he had a super rare lymphoma.
Like rare, as in like,
there were three other dogs in the world who've ever had it.
And his sample got sent to UCLA
at the cost of 700 dollars from us.
And he had bigger swollen lymph nodes
and he had the highest amount of steroids he could have.
And when we got back, he just had all fluid
in his chest.
Fluid in his chest and he was struggling to breathe.
We had to put him down that night
and it was the most heartbreaking thing.
So two things, like coming home from Brisbane
those two times were devastating news.
Crushed, crushed, absolutely crushed both times.
I still cry about Butters sometimes.
But yeah, so we're like, oh, this is a bummer.
And then what happens with,
and then your body changed right before surgery, right?
You felt your body changed.
No, no, no, this is, oh yeah.
Yeah, well, we got back,
like we got back from Brisbane
and we had an appointment with our fertility specialist
like on the Monday or something.
And so I went to the bathroom and you told him.
Yeah.
And he pretty much laughed.
He laughed.
He's like, oh, that's fine.
In your situation, it's fine.
Yeah.
And then when I came back in from the bathroom,
he pretended to get like super mad at me.
Look, you forgot the spray.
And you look, I'm sorry.
He's like, what are you doing?
But yeah, no, it turns out, it turns out it was all okay.
He wasn't worried and did the scan
and everything was still there and fine.
It was the biggest relief ever.
So they check.
So at that moment then they actually,
they check you for how many eggs you've got growing, right?
Yeah.
They scan you.
And you're supposed to have 10 to 15
for your age and like your health
and boost and everything.
Yeah.
Well, that's more like minimum kind of.
Yeah. 10 to 15 minimum.
Yeah.
You can have more.
Yeah.
They find four.
Four eggs.
And they say.
Oh, well, there were more eggs, but those four were, yeah.
Four big eggs.
So they're like, these other ones won't mature.
Probably these four eggs are ones that might mature
to big, big eggs for the surgery.
And we're like, and they said most IVF surgeries
would just go ahead,
but we want to give you the option to pull back,
try not to like pull back,
start a different course of hormone treatment
and see if we can get more eggs
and then try again in a few months.
Yeah.
Because they weren't sure if it was
the specific medication that they had put me on
or if it was just the max of what my body could produce.
So we didn't know because it was the first round.
It was kind of like an experiment almost.
Yeah.
So, yeah, we didn't have high hopes at all.
And we, you go into surgery and you told.
We decided to go ahead.
We decided to go ahead.
Yeah.
Anyway.
We decided to go ahead because we're like,
we're like screw it like,
because we got into the elevator and of the place
and always there's always the case where I'm like,
oh, great news.
Like, and Amy's like has the exact opposite opinion.
Like, it's devastating.
And I'm like, no, they said in two months we can go.
I was in tears.
Yeah.
And Amy's in the same.
And it was at that moment that I was like,
I was, I said to, I said to you, I was like,
fuck it.
I was like, let's just go for it.
And we were very lucky to get into a draw
for a block of land that we're originally going to build on.
And then we ended up going to end up selling it long story,
whole of the long story.
But, but essentially we knew we're going to come into like,
you know, pop, pop, possibly come into 10 or 15 grand
with money off tax that we could put towards another round.
So we're like, I was like, fuck it.
Let's just roll the dice on this one.
We got four X maybe.
And, you know, like whatever, like let's just,
and also if you, if the first one fails,
they give you the second one for free.
Or that same, that same, you pay for IVF once.
The first one's, if first one fails, the second one's free.
Yeah. Yeah.
So like whatever, like, like who cares?
Like let's just do it.
Let's get something moving.
It's been five years.
It's ridiculous.
And Amy's like, yeah, let's do it.
I'm like, all right, let's do it.
So we just decided to go ahead.
We like made the decision, like screw it.
But you're still very down about the whole thing.
And when you went into, to get the surgery, you told-
Agro-travel.
Yeah. Agro-travel.
When you get, yeah, when to get it.
You told them, no, I'm not gonna have any.
Didn't know you said-
Yeah.
Yeah. I just have, I don't know.
I just, I don't know.
A couple of things changed
and it just made me doubt everything.
And I was like, no, I don't think we'll have.
I thought I had already ovulated
and that those eggs were gone.
Yeah.
And so, yeah, that was brutal.
But we went in and it used to be tradition
that they would write the number of eggs on your hand.
So when you woke up from surgery, you could see it.
They don't do that anymore.
No.
But the nurse decided-
Well, here they don't do it anymore.
Yeah, here they don't do it anymore.
I don't know if they do it.
So here they decided to, they decided to do it.
Yeah. The nurse was very nice
because I mentioned it.
And she's like, oh, well, if you want me to, like,
I'm happy to run it on your hand.
And I was like, yeah, okay, why not?
And I was expecting like a big fat zero
when I woke up from anesthetic.
You wouldn't write, they wouldn't have put a zero.
They'd wait for like, you could wake up and be like,
what's this?
Like, they wouldn't put zero.
They wouldn't say like, they wouldn't write anything
and they're just like, you're specialist.
Oh yeah, I was both.
But we ended up taking this photo of the experience.
So this is us when we got back from our house.
Amy's drugged up, super drugged up there.
Such a great photo.
And a big nine.
So we got nine eggs.
Yeah.
And that was a huge surprise for us.
Yeah, massive.
We were like, what?
I thought it was getting zero.
Yeah, we were blown away.
That was incredible.
And we're like, nine.
We're like, and we just kept saying to each other,
like, throw the day at nine.
We did nine, nine eggs.
Like, that's so cool.
And then, and you know, they, you know,
I stayed home from work masturbating, which is great.
Someone sperm in, whatever.
And they talked about, you know, how long was it?
We had to wait or something
to see if the eggs fertilized or something.
It was only like, I think it was only like 28, 48 hours
or something like that.
But they kept calling us every couple of days
to give us updates on how they were all going.
And it must have been 24 hours
because I remember the next day we got a call
from the clinic and they were like,
you had nine eggs, eight have successfully fertilized.
And we're like, what?
Yeah.
Eight little souls born at that moment.
Yeah.
And then they were like, oh, we'll keep an eye on them
over the next couple of days to see how they progress.
And she was like, you could end up losing like half of them.
And yeah, that should give us a column.
Yeah, let us know what was going on.
And then by the end it got down to four.
Yeah, we had four that were pretty much good to go
for us to use.
Then one died or something.
Yeah, then one didn't make it the next day.
And so we're left with three.
Because that little side coat or whatever it was
wasn't baptized, is it in hell now?
Too dark?
Too dark?
I don't know.
No, babies go to heaven.
Even the ones that were commanded to be killed
by God in the Old Testament.
Yeah, so we have three then, right?
Yeah, and they bring us, they give us a tour.
We're paying for this, we're paying out of the pocket.
So they let us have a tour of the science facility
or whatever, and we saw it all working.
And I didn't know this,
but they actually showed us the sperm
heating the egg and forming like life, right?
Like, well, they're both living things anyway.
They're living tissue.
So I don't know if life starts then
because they're two living things already.
So life started for 3.4 billion years ago or around then,
we think, on this plan.
But so, super interesting.
So we actually have the footage
and would like to show it
and kind of talk about what's happening.
So, this is the footage.
I'm gonna turn the audio off.
But this is the actual egg.
And the egg, you can see around the edges there,
there's like little sperms and stuff hanging out.
And, or whatever.
And what happens is, so this device,
it has like nine focal planes or 15 focal planes.
So it like takes different photos, different rates.
These are our different eggs
and is showing us a bunch of stuff, blah, blah, blah.
So this one here is the one
that we actually fertilized, the green one.
So this is the one that actually got implanted,
the little fetus that's in there now.
So you can see it's splitting.
It's splitting from one cell to a few cells
to more cells, to multiple cells.
And it keeps doing that, which is really cool.
And then they move into a different dish.
And this is the exact one now,
the exact fetus zygote that's forming.
So I think this is a pre-plasticis or something.
I'm not a science man.
But yeah, this is actually the process
of the zygote coming together.
Which is really cool.
And it's all just happening from the instructions of the DNA.
And it's mind-blowing.
You actually explained to us like that,
explain to us chromosomes and stuff
and how like if you have the wrong amount,
the baby will, the fetus will die.
And that's it's kind of forming.
Isn't it crazy?
And it'll, if it has the wrong amount,
you'll have a miscarriage.
And that's what will happen
because they actually don't,
the chromosomes don't fit through a certain hole
or something like that.
Not very smart man, but I know what love is.
But, and this is him describing all that.
But what's really cool is, and then he said,
but there are some that don't end in a death
of the miscarriage.
And that's when you get things like
chromosomal problems like Down syndrome
and things like that.
Those ones can continue to survive.
But yeah, so this is the doctor doing all that.
And this is when we first heard the heart beat.
So, and what's really cool is,
and there's the little, little child.
This was like seven weeks pregnant.
Something like that, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh no, I think it's like two weeks pregnant.
No.
But anyway, but what's cool is we,
we have just, we have just entered the stage
where the fetus is,
where baby is starting to develop consciousness,
which is really cool.
So it's starting to have a subjective experience
after 24 weeks, I think it is,
which is really cool.
Yeah.
So I think it can start to understand noises
and things like that and like remember them.
Yeah.
The other night, Amy told me to push on her belly hard.
And I did.
I did not say that.
How did that happen?
Well, I thought I could feel the baby's head
on to one side and I rolled over
and I was like, feel this is really hard.
And he thought I said, push hard.
And I was like, I'm like, whoa, I'm just like, you moved it.
So our child might have fingerprints in their head.
We actually, we're not finding out the gender
because obviously we won't know the gender
until old enough to tell us.
I've been saying that to, that's somewhat of a joke,
kind of, but I've been saying that to our family and friends
just to get them real pissed off.
Like, ah, like the more variety friends and stuff.
So fun.
But we talked in the last podcast,
we don't care if our child's gay, straight.
You know what?
I'll still love our child if they're straight.
If they're cisgendered, I'll still love them.
We don't care if they're straight, gay, bisexual, transgender.
We don't care about any of that stuff.
No, that matters.
So, yeah, so that was like kind of our journey
of getting pregnant.
And then...
Telling Dave was really hard.
Yeah, tell us that, yeah.
Tell us that I was about to go there.
I, sorry, like, I can't remember how many days after,
I got implanted, but when I got a blood test
to then find out if we were actually pregnant or not.
So when I got that done,
and then because I was the one who got the blood test,
the clinic called me with the results to let me know.
And so both Dave and I were at work that day.
So we weren't together.
So I found out first.
That's right.
And it was the nurse that called me.
She's lovely.
Although when she first called me,
she had like a really down tone.
And I said to her straight away, I was like,
oh no, is it like, it didn't work, did it?
And she was like, no, no, no, you're pregnant.
And I was like, oh my God, what?
And I just burst into tears.
And then, there you go.
I was gonna say, when they implanted it,
like Ben goes, our VS versus goes.
50%.
You guys, 50%, we go, what?
50%.
50%.
And we're like, what are you talking about, dog?
Like 50%, we thought 20 at best.
So it was like a coin toss.
And this isn't like magic numbers, tape degree,
soy isn't, you know, soy will give you a 50%.
This is like real number, like real science
from specialists who train absolute experts in the field.
The topic, well, how many deliveries have you done?
Thousands, thousands of deliveries.
Yeah, handsome as well.
Anyway, so-
Should I leave the room?
Maybe when we, maybe after, maybe leave after we give birth.
So me and him, we have a cuddle.
So, him and I actually have a cuddle.
So yeah, so keep going.
Oh yeah, so I found out first.
So I said to the nurse,
oh no, I explained to her that both of us went
to like in the same room together
and that I was gonna go home after work
and tell Dave then,
because I wanted to film his reaction,
because he films me with everything,
so I'm gonna film him.
And yeah, so I had like the whole-
You missed the part where I told you to call up.
Oh yeah.
I called Amy and I said,
oh, we're supposed to find out today.
Okay, I was like, can you call them?
And Amy was like, nah.
And I was like, no, they'll call us.
And I'm like, no, I was like, when to find out?
And then I was working from home and then you-
Oh yeah, cause you were like, yeah, add them to the call.
Did a three-way chat and I was like, oh no.
And I was like, no, I'll just call,
I'll just hang up here and I'll call them
and then I'll call you back.
And so I called back the nurse and I was like,
Davey's getting really antsy, he wants to know.
And I had told her what I wanted to do.
So she knew and I was like, can you just call him
and delay him until I get home from work?
And she laughed and she's like, yeah, I get no worries.
And then she calls me and she's like,
oh, hi, this is blah blah blah, calling from blah blah.
I'm just gonna inform you.
Unfortunately, we don't have your results today.
I'm like, why?
And they're like, oh, they sent them to the wrong lab.
I'm like, oh, I know, I'm like, okay, thank you for calling.
I'm like, incompetent, why are these, what is the why?
You know, why is-
Yeah, and she told him that we wouldn't get the results
till the Monday, cause this was a Friday that we found out.
So it wasn't going to be until the next week.
Yeah, so Dave then thought that we weren't finding out
until Monday and so I came home a bit early.
I was recording a video and I heard the door open weirdly.
And I was like-
I was trying to be really quiet.
And I was, and you walk in and I was like,
oh, hey, and then you're like, you're kind of working like,
hey, I'm like all just weird.
And I was like, I was like, okay, like you're acting weird.
And I was like, why are you home early?
I thought I'd come home early.
You're like, okay.
And I was like, gonna continue recording my video.
And then I was like, this is weird.
I'm just going out there and see what's going on.
I come out there and I see your phone.
And I was like, why is your phone there?
Whatever, like I didn't even think.
I was just like, I can't believe they screwed up.
Like I'm just, you know, being a Karen, I guess,
or being whatever, being like just trying to vent.
And then-
And I was like, yeah, I know, it really sucks.
And yeah.
Supercatted about it.
We got the video, but we won't keep it to ourselves,
but we opened the, Amy goes, oh, there's a bun in the oven.
And I said, and at that time,
one of our roommates had COVID
and we were giving them food under the door.
Yeah.
And we opened up the, and I was like,
oh, I didn't put it there.
And she's like, there's a bun on the oven.
And I was like, I didn't put it there.
And I was like-
Yeah, you started getting really mad at me.
I was like, I'm so glad I have this on camera.
I was like, well, I didn't put it there.
And then, and then you like pick something.
Don't touch it.
It's probably, probably Brock did it.
Like Brock's probably like put it there to cook it last night.
And like, you're gonna might get COVID.
Yeah. He's like, go brush your hands.
I'm like, go brush your hands.
And you're like, there's a bun in the oven.
And I was like, I didn't put it there.
Like, it's not as bad as I'm making out,
but like, okay, well, we got a video to see.
And then, I think he's hadn't said like two or three times.
And then, and then I was like, I paused and I stopped.
And I was like, are you pregnant?
And then you're like, yeah.
And I was like, oh, and I like touched your belly.
And then I like stood back and I was in shock for ages.
I don't know what to say.
I was just like, yeah, he like froze for a little bit.
Yeah.
Cause in my mind, I was like, just give us the bad news.
We've had five years of bad news.
Like just give us the bad news
so we can make a huge bowl of pasta, eat our feelings
and like watch movies or weekend to try and like,
get out of the headspace or whatever.
But when we find that out, we're like, what?
And the first person, and the first people we told
weren't our family, it was, well, they, I guess,
I'll call them our family, like Tom and India.
We went and told them, cause they've been like
right by our side the whole time, you know,
supporting us and the whole journey.
Even when they didn't necessarily, like,
we held off on IVF for some things once.
And they were like, they thought we should've done IVF.
And even though they thought that they still,
they didn't like push that opinion on us or anything.
They just, you know, they were like,
we supported us the whole time, which was really cool.
And just really, I know, they're always there
to talk to as well.
But yeah, so we told them and how we tell them.
Oh, we went and got like a tray,
pretty much of donuts.
And then wrote on the, like, on the inside of the box lid.
I don't even remember what it said,
something like, like, eat up.
I can't be the only one with a belly.
And then baby McDonald's to Jan, 2023.
And there's another one where you had the whole family over.
Poppy was up, everyone was up.
And I was like, oh, let's go get a photo in front of them.
We're doing a Christmas in July thing.
Big photo in front of the Christmas tree.
And I was like, oh, I'm gonna take a photo.
And I was like, everyone say after me, repeat after me.
And I was like, three, two, one, Amy's pregnant.
And they're like, what?
And they're all just like freaked out, people crying.
You know, people go, oh, it was crazy.
It was really cool.
Yeah, it was.
And we filmed it so that everyone's faces like shocked.
You can see who first, you're done.
Is that the back?
It's just like, just like, apparently he was like,
why would he joke about something like this?
Like he was like, because I always joke
about inappropriate things.
Why would you joke about something like this?
And then it took, I guess he was so triggered
or like, so like, why would he do this?
You didn't realize that you actually were pregnant
until everyone was like reacting.
So that was pretty funny.
You can see everyone's like, how they process it.
We had, you know, one of our, Colin come over
and I said, he was standing there and I said,
look at us, just three of us hanging out.
And he went, three.
You mean four?
Oh yeah, four, because Manny was there.
I said, look at us, four of us.
No.
Is there alcohol in this?
Maybe. Dream Act.
Sorry, I was like, look at us,
just four of us hanging out and he's like, four.
And I was like, yeah.
I was like, you, me, Amy, baby.
And he's like, oh.
And then we have, you know, we have a good friend
who I used to always come home and say,
hey babe, to Amy.
And that'd say, hey, babe.
Like, and then so we became the Bebs.
So, and then I said, we're like going for a drive with them.
And I was like, look at us, four Bebs in the car.
And they're like, what?
Four.
I'm like, oh, baby, same thing.
So it was really cool how we like told everyone.
It was really fun.
Yeah, it was.
From what I was saying.
And we played D&D game with everyone.
And did we do anything for that?
We were initially.
No, we were thinking about it, but no, we didn't end up.
Yeah.
We didn't end up doing it.
We were gonna make like some like thing for the D&D thing
where it's like Amy's character gets pregnant
or Amy plays a fairy or something
or like to tell everyone, but we didn't.
Yeah, it was really cool.
It was really special, but it was a really hard process.
And I feel sorry for people who go through the process.
Like, I mean, we went through five years,
but people go through much longer
and they do many failed attempts at IVF.
Yeah.
Do you have any advice for someone
who is going through that themselves?
It's a very good question.
I think having at least one person to talk to about it
is definitely something needed,
whether that's a family member or a friend
or I went to a psychologist.
Yeah.
Having just one person that you can talk to about it
like freely and openly definitely is a bit helpful
to someone to like air your thoughts and stuff
because yeah, you have a lot of stuff
run through your head at that time and yeah, self care.
Yeah, being kind to yourself
because it's, yeah, it can be a really sucky time
to be honest.
Yeah, and it feels like it's never gonna end.
Yeah, it does feel like it's never gonna end
and you're just gonna constantly have
broad block after broad block
and like more money that you have to fork out at it
and how are you gonna be able to afford it
and yeah, there's heaps of stuff in there.
And that's if you're in a country
that you can have access to something like that.
Yeah, some people have to fly to other countries
to get it done.
Yeah, sorry, it's a, yeah, it can definitely take a toll.
Yeah, and it's one of those things too where like,
I mentioned before, I made a joke about,
what are you alone, you're going to a psychologist.
I didn't mention, but I should have mentioned
straight after with that.
The reason that is a joke is
because I'm the biggest advocate.
I think everyone should go to therapy.
Every single person should go therapy
at times in their life, even just to check up,
just to talk to someone about stuff
because mental health and mental wellbeing
is a huge thing that we need to destigmatize.
But also, like your drunk friend
or just your friend or your family give advice,
but it's not always the best advice.
And it's also sometimes,
you don't want to be like a dumping ground
for your friends and family,
where you go to a psychologist,
like I went to a psychologist last week
and I was like, this, this, this, this, this, this, this,
this, and then they said,
and then they just asked a few questions
and then were like, okay, I think you're dealing with X.
And then as soon as they said that,
all the pieces fell together for me in my head
and I could conceptualize the issues.
Yeah.
But in saying that,
psychology and getting mental help like that
is not always accessible for other people,
especially when money comes into it as well.
Some people just can't afford to do something like that.
That's true.
So, and another thing would be
if you're in that position,
just write down all of your thoughts on paper
or in your phone or something like that,
just something to help get stuff out of your head.
Because if you stay in your head,
you can just start going on loops
and yeah, it can become harder for you.
So just being able to like write it down on paper
just helps in the process of getting it out of your mind
and being able to think through properly
what's actually going on.
Yeah, exactly.
What advice would you have given yourself five years ago?
Like, and let's take off the table,
like do IVF straight away?
Like advice like that, like practical advice,
but like advice like how to deal with it emotionally
and things.
Oh, I don't know.
Probably the be kind to myself.
I was very much a person
who puts other people's feelings ahead of mine.
And so if someone would start giving me advice
that I couldn't deal with hearing,
I would just sit there and grin and bear it.
Whereas I should have like sat there
and thanked them for their love and care and advice.
But at this time,
I might just don't want to talk about it at the moment,
which is fine.
You don't have to talk about it with every person
who asks you, oh, when are you guys gonna start a family?
You guys have been married for however long.
Don't do that, people.
Don't ask people about it.
Like when are you gonna start a family?
It can cause a lot of stress for people
who may be trying to have kids.
What do you say to someone who?
Or even for people who decide that they don't want kids.
Some people decide that they don't want kids
and don't want to have to explain to everyone
why that is and stuff.
It's their own personal choice.
What like so, and everyone, if you've got questions,
we're gonna be wrapping up soon.
So to send them through, I see River City Films.
I'll ask you a question in a sec.
But what do you think about doing IVF
from a religious perspective with the idea
of like the idea that cells come together
in the peak tradition, things like that?
What advice would you give to someone
who's concerned about that?
If they are.
If they're religious, yeah.
Well, you can have a different take on things
that being that God or whoever you believe in,
or it depends what you believe in,
created these people to.
Yeah, it triggers me.
But yeah, go for it, yeah, do that, yeah.
God gave scientists smart brains so they could science.
But let's not accept them when it comes to vaccines
and blah, blah, blah, blah, because an evolution.
Anyway, keep going.
Yeah, no, I agree.
That's what you should do, but I'm just...
Well, it's just another, I know,
but it's another way to help those people get through.
Like God has created these people
and they've gone down these different study routes
and stuff, and so they've learned the scientific method.
And so therefore you can still use that
and you can still get IVF and stuff, and it's not bad.
Bad, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, it's hard.
Yeah, so it's a way to conceptualize.
It's about conceptualizing things, I think.
Yeah.
People who go to church tend to, you know,
view things a certain way and it actually helps them.
That's why I think religion sticks around.
If it's working for you, go for it, like keep doing it.
I don't think it's true.
I'm not convinced of the existence of any God or gods.
Or deities, or supernatural, or paranormal,
or anything like that.
But it doesn't mean I'm not open to changing my mind,
but if something's working for you,
if you, you know, Biddy Buddha, she's badass
and she's like full atheists and stuff,
but she likes doing tarot cards and stuff like that.
She just finds it fun.
And for her, it's like a thing that helps her.
Like she finds it fun, she finds entertainment from it,
she finds, it gives her like a nice story.
Like people, you know, I read Lord of the Rings
and I get like, you know, feelings from Lord of the Rings
and that helped me think about things.
Or I remember, you know, playing Zelda
and then, you know, when I had to do something challenging
in the real life, I actually thought about the courage
that Zelda had, you know, these stories that,
Zelda's not real, but Link is not real,
but there's stories, these are stories
that we tell ourselves to get through things.
So if you have to think about being like Link
and having courage, go for it.
If you have to pray to a God, go for it, whatever.
Do whatever you think is, I'm not a hard-lined atheist
that thinks everyone should believe what I believe.
I'm just not convinced of the evidence.
But I'm open to change my mind.
Yeah, so that's what I would say.
River City Films said,
what's the most exciting small thing that you're looking forward
to as being about, to being a parent?
I love Christmas.
Massively.
Hugely.
And so I...
I know, I can't wait to start our
in little family Christmas traditions
with the kids.
Yeah, that'll be really cool.
Like setting up the Christmas tree
and going and look at Christmas lights
and what have we ended up doing on Christmas Eve
and staying together and stuff.
Yeah.
Stuff like that.
My...
And this is weird,
but I know that...
I can see how...
I've been looking at how I've been treating our puppies
and to what I enjoy and what I don't enjoy
and trying to better myself
with how I approach things without dogs.
So if a dog wants to cuddle,
I'm not gonna...
I'm trying not to turn it away and push it away.
If I don't want to, I'm trying to...
This is weird, man.
But anyway, the point is
one of the things I loved about Butters
was helping him overcome fears
and helping him overcome...
showing the dog new things.
And I've always been like that.
I think that I'm really excited to show
our children stuff.
So I want to show them...
show them cool things in Minecraft.
I want to take them to the beach
and show them waves for the first time, show them how to swim.
Yeah, it's all about first-time stuff.
Yeah, first-time things like that.
We live in a cool area,
making friends with the kids
down at the local playground
and playing handball
and things like that.
I also look forward to getting out of the house a lot more,
hopefully getting more energy, losing weight
and things like that,
not just sitting behind the computer all the time.
I'm just really looking forward to that.
I used to make video games.
So it'd be really cool to take their drawings
when they get to a certain age
and maybe put them in video games.
I don't know if that'll happen.
This footage may be held against me
in the court of the children in the future.
But yeah, just doing things like that,
like putting stuff in video games,
it's just kind of cool.
But yeah, and just showing them things.
I've always wanted to be like,
take the kids
prospecting, not prospecting,
but looking at fossil beds.
There's one close to us,
you can't take them,
but there are insects
that are hundreds of millions of years old there.
And just showing them the different levels
and learning ourselves
and looking for fossils to look at.
Well, the stars,
showing them stars and explaining the grandness,
the bigness of the cosmos
that's incomprehensibly large
is just
really awesome.
That's what I'm really looking forward to.
River City film said
River City film said
that's really cute.
And that's Josh
and another thing is traveling.
I can't wait to mention that.
Traveling with our kids is going to be huge.
Traveling to Bali with Josh,
River City films would be a cool thing to do.
So yeah, traveling around
is a huge thing for us.
And the names that we've picked out
are actually related to travel in a way.
So
got a boy's name and a girl's name
and
yeah.
So it's going to be good.
Yeah.
So it's all like your first time stuff
and then family time
and traditions.
So
also part of the McDonald's
with the largest clan of Highland Scots,
McDonald's
means son of Donald.
So there was a guy named Donald
ages ago.
But I think it's like 25% of McDonald's
can trace their lineage back to Somalad.
And Somalad was
like this, the king of the
northern, I think he was a king.
He was something of the northern.
He was the dude, the big dude of the northern,
the western coast of
Scotland.
And he fought off the Vikings and beat them.
And that's like from him.
He had a son with a Viking wife or something
and blah, blah, blah.
Creating the McDonald's clan McDonald's
and
and
25% of McDonald's can trace their lineage back
and so it'd be really cool.
He was around 1150 AD.
Really cool to get a DNA test.
That's like a thousand dollars for that type of test.
But to get that DNA test to actually see
if we're, if our child
is related to Somalad,
which would be really cool.
Because we can then trace our lineage back to
1150 AD like in the exact person.
And then I've got a book back there that goes through
all the clans.
Sorry, side note, clan McDonald's
was so big at one stage they threatened
the Scottish crown.
Cool, right?
So, yeah,
so that, so River City films
called The Boy Boeing.
That's funny.
So
Mr. Brutleg said before, how do you feel about stories
of children who were brought
via Syracuse to cram their bio-parents?
In regards to like
just like them meeting?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I've known.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Like if it was us
and we went through
a surrogate
and we were fine with them
meeting
her.
We're not really like
Yeah, I wouldn't like
hide it or anything like that.
This comes back to us like the honesty thing.
Like we're very open and honest
and like, you know,
like we'd probably tell them from an early age
we kind of respect
their intellect.
We're gonna try to hide things.
So I guess like, yeah, it'd be like, yeah,
you're causing good to see your mother
or whatever, like I wouldn't be care if they would
be part of our lives or I'm not gonna like.
Yeah, or even if they were adopted
and stuff, if they wanted to go
and meet their
biological parents.
Yeah, I'd be definitely
in support of that.
I'm not denying
that it'd probably be emotionally hard.
Yeah, it would be.
And you'd have a lot of emotions come up,
and I wouldn't deny them
of that at all.
I have the right.
One of the things that we do as well
is like this many times
we've been jealous of stuff in a relationship.
But
I remember once I saw
there's this guy at church
come up behind you, give you a big hug from behind
and like held on from
maybe a huge hug. It was way too long
and it made me like it was when we first started dating
and it felt like I looked away.
I didn't like it.
And
I remember telling you
that made me feel jealous
but it wasn't for you to correct anything.
I didn't want you to correct anything.
I was like this is what I'm dealing with.
I felt jealousy then.
I'm trying to work through my jealousy.
And you're like did you see what it after?
I was like no, I pushed him away
the hug was way too long
and whatever.
And so we always do that in a relationship
like we'll tell each other how I feel jealous
but it's not to make the other person change the behavior
because that's enabling
the jealousy. It actually makes the jealousy worse.
It's something
if I'm jealous about something or if I'm jealous of something
we just show empathy
to the other person. I'm sorry if you like that
is anything I can do to help you not feel like that.
And I think that's a good way
to approach things. So when it comes to
children
even if it's things like
they're like one parent more
or whatever
or kids go through stages.
Anything
we try and just be open
honest with our feelings and talk about
how we can deal with that.
A lot of that comes from
learning about how to deal with things
through a psychologist and it's really helped us.
So once again
I recommend everyone go to a psychologist.
So with that said
we're going to wrap up if anyone's got any last questions
but
essentially that's our story
our IVF journey.
Do you have any other advice
for anyone
with IVF
or fertility stuff?
Other than what I've already said
I don't know
you're putting me on the spot here.
I've got a better question
forget that first question
do you have any advice for people who know someone
who want to help someone, support someone
who's going through a fertility treatment?
Just listen.
Like check in
and see how they're going
and just listen
to what they have to say.
Like
if they want advice
or anything
then they'll probably ask.
So yeah, just be a sounding board
because
too many people start interjecting
their personal
opinions and it might not line up with yours
and then make things more difficult for you.
Be a sounding board to those people.
So when you say listen
that means don't give advice
unless asked.
It's so tempting
you see the little chickling coming out
of its shell and you want to peel apart the shell
you've got to let it get out of the shell itself
you've just got to hold your tongue
and it's really hard
but sometimes it's the best thing to do
and I do this conversation
outside of it
as well
when I'm talking to someone
I'll say hey do you want me to listen
or are you after advice
and usually that'll
prompt them and sometimes
people just want to rant and they just want someone to listen.
I've even had people
I've caught myself giving too much advice
and they say I don't want advice I just want to tell you
and I'm like okay cool cool cool
and that's what kind of
it's often good to ask them
what the expectations are for you
and that's a big thing in relationships as well
but
the lady of the husband
or wife or husband
or whatever might come home and be like
ranting and the usually
what I find is a lot of my mates
the husbands will start
or the partners, boyfriends, whatever
will start solving the problems
solve solve solve solve
because they want to solve the issue
where you've got this problem here's the solution
but the partner doesn't want a solution
they're just
they're experiencing an emotional
something emotional and they need
empathy
and I had once again
psychologists point out to me that
there's actually like a mechanism in the brain
that essentially blocks that
any form of
any form of the ability
to deal with the problem
until they have dealt
with the emotional part first
so
if you came home and you're like ranting about something
listen to you, I can touch you
I can offer you empathy if you're sad
or whatever and it's not until you've dealt
with that emotional part of it that you can actually
deal with the rational part of it and that's the same
for me as well
so it's good to just ask
hey
do you want me to just listen or
would you like some advice and that'll usually give you the answer
it's a really good tool to
say
yeah
