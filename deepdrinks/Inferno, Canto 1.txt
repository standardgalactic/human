In the midst of life's journey, I found myself lost in a dark forest, straying from the righteous path.
Woe is me! How did I lose my way in this dreadful place?
At that moment, the spirit of Virgil appeared.
Fear not, Dante. I am here to guide you through the darkness.
How did you come to my aid?
I was sent by Beatrice, your beloved, to lead you on a journey through hell and purgatory.
Will I also reach paradise?
Your faith and love for Beatrice will guide you.
Follow me, and you shall witness the eternal consequences of sin.
With renewed hope, I follow Virgil, prepared to face the harrowing realms that await us.
