but this is going to be a good one, it's going to be a fun one, let me just tell you that.
So before we get started though, I want to quickly mention a couple of awesome things coming up.
So Deep Drinks is getting a pretty sick lineup coming up.
We've got Read Nice Wonder coming up, how many times are we going to say coming up,
but we've got Read Nice Wonder coming on to talk about street epistemology,
which is a really interesting and new way to have really hard conversations.
You can use it when you're talking to your super religious auntie
or you can use it when you know, talking to your manager at work.
You can literally, like this is really, it's a really good way to have hard conversations,
but mainly about beliefs and things like that.
We have Nidhi coming on, Nidhi is going to be an awesome one.
So Nidhi says that he was essentially a part of a cult,
that a lot of what his story sounds like sounds very much like what my church was like.
So I'm wondering, I'm going to ask Nidhi, was I part of a cult?
So we're going to be talking about cults and Nidhi's story as well.
And then after that we have Bidi Buddha, a friend of Tang, a friend of the show.
Bidi is about us and she is a ritual agnostic according to her TikTok,
which is going to be a fun exploration into, you know,
Ken Atheist or people who don't believe in, I guess, the supernatural
still engage in like things like tarot cards or crystals or things like that.
So that's going to be a really, really fun one as well.
And we have some more guests that I'm still working on the final details with,
but the good things are happening over here at Deep Drinks.
Lastly, we have a huge amount of support coming in for this channel.
And as you can see, we're up to nearly 400 subscribers.
So when we get to a thousand, we're doing a charity stream,
a six hour charity stream and it's going to be a big party.
It's going to be awesome.
I'm going to try and raise some money for charity and I really appreciate everyone's support.
So if you like content like this, please subscribe.
It means the world to me and yeah, it'd be absolutely awesome.
So with that said, I'd like to introduce our guest for a second time,
Oz, who's the founder of Tang,
who owns with his amazing partner, Jenna, who's black female atheist.
So Tang stands for the Atheist Network Group.
Oz is also a rapper about to release an album called Devil's Night on Devil's Night this Sunday, the 30th.
It's a banger of an album too.
It was a banger of those tracks I've heard.
Awesome, by the way.
Today we'll be going to have a fun one talking about the creative process behind the album,
the why, the where and the how.
So with that said, I'd like to welcome Oz back to Deep Drinks Podcast.
Good to be back, man.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How are you doing?
I'm feeling great, man.
I just want to say that I'm always excited when we get to drink whiskey and you've chosen whiskey.
And it's actually quite a good time to celebrate because last time you were on, we had 200 subscribers and now we're nearly at 400.
So we've literally doubled in subscribers since you've come on, which is awesome.
So it's a stock.
The people are liking the channel.
What are we drinking?
Well, I went kind of went deep in the pockets on this one.
You know what?
I'm getting ready to do another live stream.
The greatest rapper alive that's living curling.
That's David McDonald.
I'm talking about.
There's a little video clip on the YouTube channel.
Shout out to Heaton Queen.
I might have to ask you to remove that because Eminem and Dre might want the rights.
So I'm signing some deals.
I can't talk about it here, but anyway, keep going what you're saying.
It's true.
You know what?
I didn't think about that.
Jenna, I know you're in the chat.
You should take that down immediately.
But no, it's a I wanted to make the angels envious tonight.
So we're going to sing all the praises to the devils and the demons because this does launch on those notes.
Awesome.
Awesome.
And and I'm drinking.
I couldn't get the fancy ass some angels envy.
So I got the POVO Jack Daniels Tennessee Apple, which is what I drink last time.
But but it's the best I could do here in.
That should be delicious too.
Okay.
Awesome.
I'm glad it's up to scratch.
No shame there.
So one thing to get.
So I wanted to argue with you a little bit.
Right.
So this is the perfect way to introduce a guest as I take my first sip.
So I've got a bit of a reputation in your community and Tang sorry, the community that that I know nothing about rap, which is kind of true.
But I like rap.
And so I've compiled a list of albums that I've listened to that I like.
And I was hoping that we could put them together in a tier list.
Let's get it.
All right.
So let's do this.
All right.
So we've got heaps of albums here.
Some of them you might not know because they're from kind of know some people would call them rap.
But and this is no particular order.
And this isn't all of them.
In fact, some of the images didn't even upload properly.
So it's actually missing some of them.
My main like favorites.
But let's just go quick off the bat and we'll see if we disagree with anything.
Where would you put ice cube war and peace, the war disc or the peace disc?
And if you don't know, it's just to get a non applicable.
If you haven't listened to it enough.
Oh, no.
I'm familiar.
It would not be in my top five.
Okay.
So BCD.
It would be in a.
It wouldn't be in.
It wouldn't be a B Serity.
Oh, it wouldn't even be.
Okay.
Hang on.
We need a.
We could put that in the D list and that's the worst.
D is the worst.
Okay.
All right.
D is the worst.
Okay.
All eyes on me.
Oh, wait.
Is this all eyes on me?
But two park.
Until the end of the time.
See, see there's a few tracks I like on that.
But as far as I can all timer, I put that at D too.
Oh wow.
Okay.
Goblin.
Part of the creator.
Oh God.
Just throw that in a trash.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
All right.
That's D T G's insane clown posse, the great molanko.
Oh God.
That's not even no, no.
That's toilet paper.

make my ranking list so. Okay, cool. So, D, what's what's coming up next? All eyes on me.
I'm going to say that that's that's an A or whatever the top one is. Oh, ST is the top.
It's like this super the best. Little Wayne, the card of three. That's top.
So what you put in two parking D and you put in little Wayne in S? If we're
just talking about albums. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. D12 Devils Night,
which is coincidentally the same same name as yours.
Oh, because it has a couple tracks on the heels. I'm going to say.
I'm going to say B. I'm going to say B. Yeah, it's good. I like our fight music.
That's one of I think D12's best songs. And the last one, the one where he went
in the disc track at the end girls. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I like
them biscuit. I did back then when I was five years on grade five. But and even
then I was like, damn, he crushed them. The Great Depression DMX.
Great. And to be fair, these are just modern albums I've listened to.
He's not necessarily every rap album. Oh, yeah, yeah. And yeah, I'm taking
them as you throw them in front of me. The Great Depression. I'm a huge
DMX fan. But as far as that album, I'll say it's C.
Okay. Compton, Dr. Dre is 2014 release. That's his worst. That's his worst
ever. So because it's Dre, I'll say C.
Okay, I disagree. I think the chronic was worse. Oh my god.
The amazing Jekyll Brothers in Saint Claine Posse. We know that's going in D.
You don't like in Saint Claine Posse.
Drake. I don't actually know what this album is called. I just know what it
looks like. Oh, it's got the song from the bottom. Now we're here.
Yeah. I'm gonna say that's that's a B as well.
B. Okay. Damn Kendrick Lamar. Oh, that put that up there with Paak and
Wayne. Okay. Ice Cube, War and Peace. The War Disc.
You can put that at the top as well. That one's nasty. That one's nasty. Wait, so
the War Disc is S and the Peace Disc is D. Yes. Okay. Straight out of Compton, NWA.
Okay.
I'll see all the hip hop fans are going to be mad at me when I say this, but I'm
going to put that in A. That's like right up there. It's right up there, but it's not.
Okay. Wait, have you have you listened to all these albums including Great
Milenco and Amazing Jekyll Brothers? I sure have so far. Okay. All right.
Music to be murdered by Eminem's second last most recent album. Yeah, throw that in a trash too.
Oh, that was a good one. Kamikaze? Throw that in a trash. Oh, you're breaking my heart.
Dr. Dre The Chronic. Oh, this is obviously a trash as well, right? No, put that. Put that at
C. The Chronic. Put that at B. B tier. Okay. Have you reading this is too late? Drake?
That's one of my less favorites of Drake. Put that at C. Oh, that's my favorite of Drake.
Dr. Dre 2001. Oh, that's instant at the top. Yeah, that's the best. We agree there. We agree there.
That's the one that we fully agree on. Slim Shady LP is first major album at the top. Yeah,
same. We agree on that. 50% get Richard I try it. Oh, at the top. At the top. All right.
Kanye West, I think this is at the top. Okay. All right. Nas Illumatic. Illumatic. Oh,
see this. That album fucks with me, man. That album fucks with me because not Nas. Nas is one of
the greatest ever as far as lyricist. But where where he got, we got fucked was he never had producers
that knew that understood how to produce a line to according to his style, right? So he got
fucked over. So I can't and I can't put that on Nas because there's nothing to do with the bar. So
I'll say put him a that that one a I can't say at the top, but I'll give him a
okay. Have you listened to The Wraith by ICP?
Dude, ICP, no matter what you say is going to be garbage bags. Okay,
name one of their songs besides miracles. Name one of their songs house of horse.
Oh, okay. I thought you were bullshitting. I really they're good. They got they've got
okay. All right. Malinko. Great Malinko. Yeah, that was that's that's this album. That's
bro. I'm I'm a hip hop it. I don't bullshit when I say that. I'll give you a lot of people don't
consider them hip hop. They consider them like horror core hip hop like some like weed.
I currently I don't consider them hip hop. I think the trash but they try to fit themselves
into the hip hop genre. So I gave them like four shots and I'm like you guys no matter what you do
your trash. I don't know man. You should read the book called behind the paint. It talks about
like the ICP is still studied in like entrepreneurial courses on like how to how to like do music
your own way. They like they literally like climb them out themselves. Like they built a
found base without like anyone accepting them. It's really interesting. I'm not that the
I'm actually got was actually creating a video called the philosophy the strange philosophy of
posse because they talk about murdering people and cutting their heads off but it's usually about
people who bash women or pedophiles and things like that. So it's like this like horror core
element anyway weird. Let's let's keep going relapse M&M. Let's just say anything that pops up
in M&M that's after the second album just throw it in the barrel just throw it in the bottom of the
barrel. Okay. In second posse bazaar that will go there.
This album I forgot what it's called by Kanye West the one after the one where he started
to go a bit weird. Oh was that Yeezus? No it's the one
I'll give that one a see because I do love it. I love that he was pushing all the boundaries
and getting out outside of the production box on that album that was yeah I've heard some people say that
I think Hopson said that he it's like he like if creativity is like a clock he like went right
back around back to zero on that and at the time I agree with him but since going back and listening
to it I feel like I was it was just ahead of his time and I wasn't ready for it because I think it's
actually awesome. Yeah action wise yeah absolutely yeah my dark twisted my dark secret twisted fantasy
oh man I love that oh that was tough uh oh I'll say I'm trying to I'm trying to be I'm trying
to keep it real let's say b as much as I love it let's say b okay come on this album ICP the carnival
of carnage please don't tell me that's a date that's a classic in Detroit rap oh oh so you're just
talking about Detroit well then yes well we'll put it up so so David because I love you
before we started that the stream I'm in there like swimwear I'm in there like swimwear
I do I do appreciate how significant that album was in its time right in
oh yeah so I will give it a C oh wow this is awesome I need to send this clip to Violent J to
get him on deep drinks um the infamous mob deep oh god that that has to go to the top just
just because the one track the one track killed the whole fucking ones hell yeah ready to die
this is read number one on Rolling Stones yeah that's that's that's a no-brainer if there's
anything above number one that goes there okay uh snoop dog doggy style uh hey hey good call good
call m&m m&m show come on that was even that's after that that's after my mother's but m&m show was
classic say goodbye hollywood soldier um till I collapse um without me clean let my closet
all classics uh I'll give him a beat on that one because that's that's before the pills took
all the way over yeah yeah that was before uh I didn't put that on here because I don't like it
the life of Pablo oh my god see people sleep on this one this is actually my favorite Kanye album
okay hands down so for me personally that's going to go at the top uh but but that one because
to me that's when he really started to talk about and and share that his mental health issues
right and he started yeah into that that was the first album he really started tapping to that and
yeah that that's my favorite album is yeah awesome and now he's sharing a little too much
yeah a little too much now yeah all right well that's let's let's let's
let's get a look back at that so we got yeah that's that's not a bad that's not a bad the only
let me just see where I would disagree actually because um obviously this icp like I would put
some stuff like way higher uh I think I think for me nwa would go down to the end of the time would
go to b tier relapse would go to b tier this would go to top tier like there's a few I'd
move around ilmatic would be s tier for me compton would be that's that's a good album that's a tier
dark twist fancy s tier damn I'd remove down do you know what album obviously didn't get
uploaded that I think is better than it's the best Kendrick album ever which is good cat good kid mad
city that is the best oh my god yeah bars bars for days awesome well now that we've uh we've gotten
that out of the way um let's let's actually jump into what you're doing so you're releasing an album
but before before we talk about Oz right which is your your your new hand or for your new rap
kind of stuff I want to talk a little bit about wretch can you tell us about wretch
I could tell you about wretch so wretch wretch was my christian rapper name before I walked away
from christianity and and faith and uh yeah wretch uh wretch wretch wretch brought the gospel man
he brought the gospel message and uh I started a group of uh I think when we were at our peak as far as
those that were involved or members or whatever the fuck you'd say we had like nine guys so it was
literally like another wootang clan but the christian version right and um it was very militant it was very
militant christianity and uh the name of the group was battleground and uh we it was literally you you
believe or you go to hell like we we were yeah we were on that shit it's like the um it's like the
heavy metal christian like our um groups and stuff they're like try be real hardcore and
praise the christ like as a lay dying and stuff did you hear about him as lay dying yeah yeah he tried
to kill his kill his partner yeah eventually yeah um yeah I was gonna say it was it was so our
our message was so aggressive in our music uh that when I walked away and it all hit me how much
damage that I either did or probably probably did or or uh more likely than not I caused uh
anybody that I had on social media that I was still connected to that were that attended our
concerts as far as like the younger crowd you know that would have looked up to us I literally
took the time to go through and send them messages like private messages on whatever social media
platform and apologize and say you know I whether you I'm not here to debate and you can still hold
that position and I'm not here to question you doubt you anything like that I just want to tell
you I'm sorry because I no longer align with that and I feel like what I said was problematic
and I just need to get that off this off my chest and get this off my shoulders uh and I think
it was two or three people responded and actually thanked me uh but yeah our message was like
stupid aggressive so yeah that all right I didn't know that yeah so did um did you notice
anything uh behind the scenes like um uh where you know like people weren't living what you would
call like a godly life in the christian music industry or was it all pretty above board
uh the the christian music industry as a whole whether it's hip hop because I also played
in a pretty successful christian rock band I played drums and we opened up for like skillet fly
leaf kids in the way um other other you know bigger names in the christian history it's a joke dude
it's a fucking joke they they all go out and party and get fucked up and you know to take people
back to their hotel rooms just like the the secular artist to do when they're on the road
the same the same things that christians throw all the stones at those folks for uh the christian
artists are doing the same goddamn thing they're doing the same goddamn thing and and I think
unfortunately for them the uh the downfalls once once they they sign the contract because
this is how you think about so you're in your early most of the late teens early 20s you you you
have a a person or an organization put a contract in front of you that we're gonna offer you
an excellent amount of dollars to record two maybe three albums right and so far they're working on
pennies right they're they're working on pennies and they sign this well they don't pay attention to
the the fine print and then the fine print these record labels and and I'll just say it now uh like
tooth and nails uh for those that are familiar with tooth and nails tooth and nails uh you know
there's a few but tooth and nails is probably one of the worst at this uh but you you sign the
contract and then it's in the fine print if you don't read it we can literally either just remove
an entire song or force you to change the lyrics to have it match what we want it to match
and that fucked so many people up in because it was like oh so I actually don't get to be me
I don't get to be artistic it's I have to do what the you know what what the powers
that be want me to do and so tooth and nails did um under oath um thousand foot crutch um
um uh demon hunter these are just bunch bunch of them that I know of mxpx was their their first
blow up mxpx yeah crucified nine lashes and if if you look up uh calibrator 13
I already knew about this but calibrator 13 um my my cousin was the front man in that band
and got signed and I remember watching the the the complete like shift or or um evolution
so to speak from the time he was writing independently then when he signed with tooth and nails
and all of a sudden there was this um there was a shift where he you could tell he just he just
left a nasty fucking taste in his mouth and I'm not saying this is why or this is what
caused it but now currently he is a um uh he is now an atheist so it's uh you know it's it's
it's amazing how things how those kind of experiences can make you start questioning
and researching and doubting and it's not it it's not the reason people walk away
but Christians don't understand in the moment when they're when they're in that
it it it is it is those situations those conversations that make you step back
and start asking okay why why am I doing this and is uh am I fighting for and speaking for a
true thing because this doesn't feel this doesn't feel right to me and it's those little little
glimmers of doubt that start the spiral there's um I just wanted to say that um that's I had a friend
who used to hang out with the the band at um Hillsong united in um in Sydney now this is conjecture
but he you know he would hang out this band there's marty there um I forgot his name
but he's the son of the of brian houston but um they would all go out and do coke after
after the shows or like a go party until really late marty now um this guy here he's an atheist
or at least he doesn't believe in god and and he's been releasing instagram posts and tiktok posts
than deleting all his posts and stuff every now and again so it's um you know it shows you like even
even uh michael googly amuchi um you know he pretended he had cancer for the longest time
and he wrote that song healer and really it was just about his pornography addiction so unfortunately
what happens is a lot of people look up to these people and they just they fade out they fall short
but they fall short in a big way and it's easy to do of course in the music industry because
you got all these people adoring you and then you're given just drugs just out me open everywhere
right so I mean no no fault to them I guess but it's like damn it should be a but above approach
you know what you at least at least that's what we're told right at least that's what we're told
but you you get put in that element right and all of a sudden you're getting paid to play music
and you you literally have people worshiping you right and that's that's what christian artists
don't talk about the ones that are still like currently or you know walking into it now or been
a part of it for you know um for how many years they don't talk about that they you literally
have people worshiping you and you you talk about getting the ego going and losing sight of
why you're doing what you're doing oh man if if you're if you're not and I can say this whether
you're you're a theist atheist would agnostic whatever if you don't know why you're doing
what you're doing and it's it's just on a whim and you stumbled into this thing and there's not
a purpose it's it is so easy to get intoxicated by the attention and the admiration and the worship
from all these people because it it makes you feel good right all these people tell me how great
you are and how fantastic you are and you know that's why I always want people around me whether
it's youtube music day-to-day life I want people around me it's that they're gonna say us shut the
fuck up you're still the same dude that you were five years ago shut the fuck up I want those
people around me because then you don't get lost in the sauce you know I mean you don't you don't get
lost in the sauce and you you keep you keep your priorities the priority period I've always I've
always felt like Jenner is a little your girlfriend Jenner is a little bit like
Amy my partner in that my wife holds me down in the best way possible in that like she doesn't
let my ideas get too crazy like I'm she's kind of like a rock and I'm a balloon looking up over
the forest and without without her holding the string I'd fly off and I'd be just I'd be insane
I'll be just weird my life would go spiraling out of control and I feel like Jenner's like that for
you she like holds you together am I right in saying that bro you have no idea especially in last 24
yeah last 24 or 48 hours like she she is that and that's a great analogy whether it's the the
string on the balloon or just the anchor when I start to float off you know like yeah my personal
anchor it like gets detached or whatever and I start to float off in the ocean in the abyss
there there she is to throw her anchor and say no no no I'm not letting you get that far away
yeah yeah yeah it's so it's so true so uh so in so now that you're you're not retch anymore
you're Oz right so um can you explain a little bit why you wanted to get back into the rap scene
back into the music what what um influence used to do that you mean you've always kind of been in it but
what's uh giving you the desire to release an album uh well one I fucking love music it it is uh
music's in my veins it's it's it's it's in our genes as a family um you know so that's first
performance I I fucking love music um but I love people David I fucking love people and
uh that this is not me like throwing shade or or um you know hating on anybody else whatever but
there there there's there's a plethora of hip-hop artist if you want to um if you want to listen
that's just it's just all about the the club bangers the hood bangers the street bangers get
fucked up get fucked like all that kind of and don't be wrong I love that shit I listen to it
right but I don't I don't I don't see or hear uh enough artists that are willing to be
vulnerable uh they're willing to just say this this this is the book this book is my life and
I'm going to open all the pages up and not only am I going to let you read it I'm going to
narrate it for you as you read it and uh and and being some of the I do love people and you
know one of my number one passions is talking about mental health and mental wellness and
mental illnesses it's something that needs to no not needs to be it has to be normalized so
and it's not on every single song but but it it is very prominent especially on this first
album so the the motivation was was there as far as internally why why do I want to do this
and then externally um obviously as we just talked about jenna has been my numero uno supporter period
in in oh she's one of our biggest supporters as well
yeah she's just a great supporter she she is she's uh if you don't know she's just a great friend
to have period um 100 period in end of story she she loves she does as well loves helping people
she cares about people um and and that that's been there and I've never um since I walked away from
faith and religion I've not had a support system around me that encouraged me
with with this skill set so to speak it was you know the you know you should have tried that when
you were 19 you should have did this when you were you know 20 um and I was I was always just
almost ashamed to say that I loved it and that I that I enjoyed uh doing it and and jenna's had a
completely different perspective and supporting me and and pushing me forward in that so that's helped
it and and even before her and I started dating really really the the tip of the iceberg and it was
I did like a couple freestyles and I recorded and I don't remember which one it was but I recorded
like one like two minute track and dr josh heard it and josh was like bro why why are you not
writing music like I would buy this shit I would buy this shit and at first I was kind of like
you're just saying that because you like you're you're my homeboy you're my homeboy you're gonna
say that shit right just just like I'm I'm gonna buy your I'm gonna buy your books you already know
I'm gonna buy your books you're saying yeah and um but he kept saying it he was persistent
and and um so yeah it was the the the internal motivations but then having those external
encouragements and um motivators that it was like you know what no fuck it doesn't matter that
I'm 40 years old it doesn't matter I I refuse to lay on my deathbed and regret not doing the
things that I was passionate about because people thought a certain thing right it you're too old
or you you know whatever I refuse to die that way just to just to um hop on what dr
josh was saying um I fully expected your album your music to be not that good not because I think
you're bad or anything but you know how like your friends do stuff and you're gonna support them
and he like doesn't matter if it's like good or bad or whatever so when you sent three stuff
I wouldn't when you started doing stuff I was like okay like I'll check it out like I'm yeah
I'm not you know I wouldn't I wouldn't listen to this if it wasn't a friend kind of I'm thinking this
I go into it I'm like damn this these are fucking slap like there's especially like I said
there's that one song I'll listen to it I'll not repeat like 10 times um it's so good uh so yeah
I I know what dr. Josh is saying it's like no this is actually good like we're not just
saying this because we're your friend this is actually good music um I and I do I appreciate
that and it and it is for for me it was kind of a uh and I mean it's a good way kind of a uh
a slap in the face reminder it's like no no like this is
like literally it's it's it what what do you want to call it genetics in my DNA whatever
like I have I have a whole family line of musicians and artists and whatever like why not
why not me why not me you know why why why should I not do it just because people think
oh there's a there's a there's a max what once you hit 40 years old like there's no hip hop
no I mean we we might disagree but I still think dr. Dre has put down hits at 50 and so is um
M&M I think um you know I think dr might be like what 60 now like he's old um I'm pretty sure he's
like 70 with a cane but yeah he can still put up bang it I'm kidding but but don't you
dr is my favorite producer of all fucking god damn time so yeah yeah yeah yeah he's um
he's he's good hey he's 57 uh and he just released a song the other day that was um
awesome and you know and seeing if the super bowl was cool too um except except for uh M&M yeah
you didn't like M&M M&M is trash now bro he's trash oh come on come on I think it's called
that he took the knee at the end put it in like that he's trash no he's not he's not as good I feel
like people what people do right is like um so Michael Jones is on the podcast like a couple of
episodes ago last episode and he was going on and on about how much he hates rings of power
I think he only hates rings of power because it's lord of the rings if it wasn't lord of the rings
it would probably still be a cool show it's like metallica metallica release load and reload
there's two albums that weren't as good as either of the albums but they were still good
albums like if they weren't metallica that'd still be good albums no that's that that is a
that's a terrible comparison that's a terrible comparison M&M's when if you listen to M&M's first
two out I'll give them three just to be gracious and generous give them three after that it's
trash bro it's garbage throw them shits in the garbage bags no there's some good songs only
kamikaze is great album um murder to be uh music to be murdered by great album like
hey like what's that um he has a really good song um oh so so if we have like one or two
good songs on like a 15 track 20 track album that makes it album good no it's okay but they're
not trash like you can't have like you okay we're gonna get all right we're gonna get the whiskies
settle in i just feel like if we're in person i'll be like shirts off wrestle like
i actually so you did mention that you wanted to go through some of your music and talk about it
and um i was hoping that we could do that and maybe get some questions um from the audience as well
um do you have stuff ready to go through some of your music your new music
i sure the fuck do um awesome uh so the first one uh the the kind of lead into this uh i only had
one feature artist uh on this album and that was intentional because again i wanted the this first
project to uh to be um about the people being able to connect to my my story that the real life
right and again being being raw and real and transparent all that so uh i like starting out with
this one but uh that's actually i imagine that's why i didn't get an invite to um to guest
on one of the songs right that's that's exactly why okay yeah that makes sense i'm glad you i'm glad
you uh
moving on sorry this this alcohols will be making me feel a bit silly so um i'll apologize if you're
trying to be serious and i'm just cracking jokes like oh no no this this first one's all fun so
it's it's okay and uh so uh if you're not familiar with blatant blatheist uh check him out on
youtube twitter uh it's that's the homie and this dude's bars bars this dude is nasty uh but
but the the kind of the premise behind this um or the concept behind this track was uh going back
to i think we talked about it um earlier but i'm i am a high school dropout i i i i i literally
got my gd by just putting designs on the paper like filling in the circles i was so
high and stoned out of my brain i was just making designs and i still got my gd thank you indiana
public school system um i still earn my gd here's here's to poor schooling
i found out um my wife's school was like 15 grand a year right and she she dropped out super young
my school was 52 a year so you look at like the difference like what are they what am i missing
out on that 15 grand holy shit yeah and the it was leading up to this like i'd add like two or
three weeks and i don't remember what the exact time span was but i just i was giving the like the
the like reminders like oh os you can't do this you won't be able to do this you can't do that
blah blah blah blah because of my history my past my you know whatever and uh when i heard this beat
first of all i was like oh this is this is nasty and i was like there's no way
blatant is not spitting on this shit with me so it's it's the only feature uh so we'll uh let me
make sure i get this queued up here and it's titled look out
maybe so just so everyone knows this isn't a release track just yet this no not really

is that he said blatant blatant blathiest on he killed it he killed it he murdered that he
yeah yeah that that was uh that yeah that was a murdering of a track
awesome people like in it
sweet yeah nathni nath and you're right that that yeah that um beat is killer as well
yeah and on this one because i do produce beats but on this i purchased everything because i wanted
to concentrate on the content so none of this i didn't produce any any of the music on this one
i might on the next one probably will on the next one but this one i outsourced everything
because i wanted to focus like i said on on the message the the content
so what was the general message of that song was it um do you have like an underlying message
look look out look out look out it says it in a title yeah because you you've told me my entire life i
can't do this i shouldn't do this i can't do this i shouldn't you better fucking look out because now
now i'm on some other shit like i don't i don't i don't need to pray to a god or believe in a god
or have faith in a god to like there's all these underlining messages to it's i don't need that anymore
all i need to know is i am me and i'm confident in what i can do and i'm i'm going to pursue this
and do this and have zero regrets when i'm laying on my deathbed zero so you can tell me whatever
the fuck you want to tell me look out because i am a fighter i am a competitor and as soon as you
tell me i can't do something motherfucker you about to learn today you might you had some lyrics in
oh no let's say um fuck your jesus fuck your a la all at the same time try tomorrow um so
it seems like this album is very much like uh like you were shedding shedding of your like
previous i guess concerns like i've tried the religious thing i've tried you know i've i've
i've gone through the work um and now it's just like fuck it i'm just gonna be me um you're essentially
coming out of rapper closet you're coming out of the rap closet yeah yeah uh i i i i i cannot disagree
with that lyrically um lyrically yes because it it uh it reminds me of what uh when we had
formerly known as fanatic uh was part of cross movement and um brady goodwin jr one of the founding
members of the cross movement and is now an atheist and jen and i uh interviewed him in
someone in the chat had asked a question you know uh are you currently working on any new music
and he said uh and i i thought i never viewed it this way but but when he said i was like man
that was my struggle for so long and i finally got out of that box but he he said now because he's not
even a year he converted right and he he said right now trying to sit down and like like right
and and like spit bars and get at it it's almost like taking like i have a new girlfriend
and i'm trying to take her back to i'm trying to take her to my ex-girlfriend and i's favorite spots
every single time you know a favorite place to to go on dates and that and i was when he said
that i was like fuck that that is a great analogy because that for the longest time that's how i felt
it was like this feels so fucking weird to not be be talking about like like rapping about
roman's 116 you know and roman's 122 and it like it feels so weird to not be doing it and then finally
when i when i got past that barrier or whatever everything just opened up and i'm like no i i'm just
gonna i'm gonna like you just said i'm just here to be me you can like it you can love it you can take
it or leave it uh this this is fucking me
wow um jenna's got a question uh i've noticed most of your music is a reflection of your past
is the direction of the next album or any music you um can point to now have more of of i
this is where my life will be vibes she's basically asking when you're gonna propose
she wants to you're right right in the song um so she knows well we we we share a very clear path on
the proposal on the marriage thing
um
but the the next album osmosis is and i've already started working on it and uh it'll have the
intro track in the the but the second track uh is the one i'm working on uh working on currently
but it's called welcome to my matrix and cool uh the yeah it there's a lot i i i definitely
expand and show uh more of my versatility as far as because these are very um and i and i
tried to explain this to uh to jenna a couple weeks ago there's there's a difference between
flowing to a beat and then writing and writing a beat right and this one i just flowed to the beats
this next one is like there's the like you get to hear all of it you get to hear the the boom
bap like slow raps uh there's the the more um like bone thugs and harmony like rapid like the
machine gun type rapping uh and i'm trying to show that but but now in this one the next one
i'm trying to um show tell demonstrate whatever where i'm at today now and how much happier i am
versus what's on this album and what's up dr we were just talking about you oh yeah can we
just point out can you please read this i'll try to read his comments every stream but i
don't do very well can you please read that out uh oh geez these two atheists am i right
am i right can't even ground instantiated ultimacy of necessary preconditions for the provision
all being self-contained prime
typical stat get out of get out of here with your presupposition
he always comes he always comes and drops free sub comments derails the conversation but i'm
totally there for it every single time cool um so this next track what's his next
track hold um so this is where like i said i i try to start a little more hype this one
because when i'm doing these interviews i want people to try to get a full spectrum
of what's on the album so this is by far the the the most emotional or dark side of the album
uh and uh it's titled sorry mom and for those who don't know my mom uh not the
past july but two julys ago ago now uh took her own life and she she was a very very
hyper spiritual hyper christian uh individual and believe that god answered all the prayers and
and was all what was going to be there to do all that and she ended up taking her own life and
this song uh this this was actually my longest process just because when you're recording
it's uh the the mic you know with the software and the effects everything as soon as you start to get
choked up you can hear it and this song took me the longest uh because for however long when
i first started recording it i would get choked up and it would fuck me up and i'd have to start over
and uh but but this one is uh for those that have uh deconstructed and deconverted and you've
you've lost family you've lost friends um you know anything like that hopefully there's
another one on the album it's called thank you um that has to do directly with this uh but this this
the this song i'm literally saying i'm sorry i'm i wrote in rap slash sung uh what i wish i was
i would have been able to say to my mom before she passed so yeah called sorry mom
and for whatever reason my phone wants to play a different song
uno momento great great build up and then
i'm sorry i'll take you home uh there it is
um
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
uh
listen
just tell it to my arm straight up i'm sorry mom
but everything i've done i'm in no harm
um
but now when i flip the book back and look back all these flashbacks
no wonder your boys the money that can somniac monomaniac with the neck
cracking a panic attack
disabusing that you're accusing guess what you're included all those nights left alone a victim in
wherever you at church talking to your fucking microphone
i'm sorry mama
i'm sorry mama
i'm sorry mama
but other drama didn't cause you
i'm sorry mama
now that's a tag to get that in fact who's the disomaniac
your life is hard i get your point of attack your problem be your family
must i hide behind the pride and set aside you committed motherfucking suicide
i'm not even mad at you after you i feel the same way when i've had a few
um
that's it that's actually the that's track number 17 that ends the album
uh on on that one and it did on purpose i want people to to walk away thinking
um i don't know what to say that's so raw it's so um vulnerable um it's inspiring that you would um
that you would do that
i think your vulnerability um helps others
and that and that's and that's all i want like again there there are the fun songs
there there there'll be the again the club street bangers all that but i want i want people to connect to the
the role the vulnerability the transparency um
um
yeah i want them to connect to that whoever hears it and listens to it because it's
that's real life man that's that's real fucking life and and art
that's what art should do it should connect us music should connect us and whether we ever meet
in real life or not we can share that connection because i hear you and you hear me whether we ever
talk in real life or not because we share that story we share that narrative um
because i don't not the only one and i know there there's many that have it way worse than i've ever
had it and if i can just help a little a little bit that's all i fucking care about
do you think um something that stood out to me uh like a quote that stood out to me not your lyrics
but a quote that came to mind when i was listening to that you mentioned about your mom do you think like
hurting people hurt people you mentioned how your mom had like a tough upbringing and then
um and then it was reflected on to you it seemed like whether or not you know um you know
putting attention into the microphone at church rather than to you
to you um do you feel like that's
that's part of it is that people that are hurting end up hurting other people
absolutely absolutely uh one one 100 percent and kathy and i have talked about this
on streams we've done together and talked about our family and so my my biological grandfather
on that side of the family uh he he was non-existent via drugs and alcohol my mom was not
excuse me non-existent via the microphone in church church god religion that was her drug
so it wasn't cocaine it wasn't alcohol it was church it was religion and that that's why that that
probably on that album that that one line
even though i'm the one that wrote it and recorded it it it still stings me when i hear it
but where were you you were at church talking to your fucking microphone
meanwhile i'm at home getting abused but where the fuck were you so she she being
when it was hurting and never truly dealt with the hurt never dealt with the abuse never dealt with the pain
she in turn whether she realized it or not i don't i don't know i probably didn't
but in return did the same thing to me that she hated about her dad
and and again if in me going through therapy and trying to cope and go through
all those things if i can give someone else a a glimpse or a little bit of a
a light at the end of the tunnel and understand that it's it first of all it's okay to not be okay
it's okay to not be okay and if you surround yourself with the right people and you
you search out therapy talk therapy you know whatever it is and uh medication
there there is a there is a brighter side to all of this you just you you
you have to surround yourself with the people um they're gonna help you and give you the tools
necessary to to i won't say when but to succeed and get and get better and improve
and overcome those things something um that i love that you're so passionate about
is telling people to go to therapy i mean you don't just run around the streets yelling
at people to go to therapy but you actually like i mean you advocate for people to go therapy
i'm the same i think everyone should go to therapy in their life i think it's
absolutely super important but um not if you're just like not if you're like a
breaking point or anything in just for maintenance um i go all the time just for maintenance like
i'll have a few sessions here and there and it'll get my thoughts back in order and then
i can continue on the thing that i want to like get across though is like people often use drugs
or alcohol or church things like that as a coping mechanism to deal with their issues um because
they're scared of medicating themselves themselves and when i say medicating i mean getting prescription
drugs from the doctor or um going to therapy or seeing a mental health professional or something
like that um the thing is is something this is something that i've noticed in you know some
close friends of one at the moment where they're really afraid to get pills from the doctor or to
go to therapy because they don't want to feel like they're broken or like or something like that
or they don't they don't like the idea of being medicated and i can relate i was there once
too scared to get medicated i was prescribed the same anti-depressants three times
and didn't take them for my anxiety uh and um it was only until one doctor pointed out that i
already am medicating myself that i'm i've got i'm medicating myself by locking myself in a dark room
and not leaving i'm medicating myself by taking valium too often i'm medicating myself by um you
know doing things uh things like unhealthy things to cope where if i just took this pill
it's a form of medication but it for me it worked a lot better or just going to a therapist
it's a form of medication that it's not as damaging as the other thing that i was doing to myself
so i think it's important for people to realize that i'm struggling with
you know what you're going through or you went through what your mum went through and what people
go through is people are always medicating no matter what it is it's just that some medications
and when i say medications i mean therapy everything like that is much more safe and helpful than
others absolutely and yes please please yes talk talk to your
psychiatrist talk to your therapist talk to
find get get with your team get with your team you and you should have a team
and get with your team and figure out what you know what what is the best recourse you know what
what is the best method for you because every every every fucking person is different right and and
how how this will look and and and how how this goes down and how it happens uh but i i will i will say
because as humans we are social
by by by nature
if if there is a launching point and and trying to figure this out and trying to find a healthier
place just find someone just find someone you can talk to just find someone that you can talk to
because talk therapy is um it's crucial man it's crucial because a lot more times than not when
you start to talk about it and you vocalize it and you hear yourself saying it out loud
all of a sudden you you start to reason more clearly and um you're thinking more clearly because
you're hearing yourself say these things rather than just think it because the brain could be a wicked
thing the brain can be a wicked wicked thing but when you start to say it out loud and communicate
these things all of a sudden it's like oh man i i know i know that's true i know that's not true
i know there's people that love me i know there's people that care about me but until you vocalize
if it's just like ricocheting in your brain that nobody cares nobody loves me nobody cares nobody
loves and and you you get you again you get consumed and wrapped up in those racing thoughts
and and in that it will destroy it will destroy it will damage and and and who knows what the end
of that looks like right for the person and that that's what just just find someone and and
fuck i don't even care if it's a professional just find somebody that you know that you can trust
just say look i i i just want you to listen i don't want you to try to fix it i don't need you
to be a problem solver right now i don't i don't actually don't say a word actually don't say a word
just please fucking listen it's also it's also great advice too when someone is telling you
something that's like a problem you ask them do you want me to listen or do you want me to
offer solutions because they'll usually just tell you like oh no i just need someone to listen
and then all you need to do is just listen like don't don't try and solve anything not until i ask
what should i do here because it's it's super important just having someone to listen that
listens to you is super important um something i've been around i've been around um folks like
a lot of n a and a meetings um and a few things they always talk about is one idle hands at the
devil's workshop so that is if you're not doing anything and if you're just spending time you're
in head you devil's workshop you're gonna go nuts um and you're gonna like start coming up with
some crazy ideas and second is um they'll say my best thinking ended me up in rehab it's like
they they they thought they had a law together and they ended up becoming addicted to some sort
of drug or alcohol or ending up in prison or incarcerated and ended up at rehab and they're
like my bet is like remember your best thinking ended you up in rehab so stop listening to your
thinking start listening to what other people are telling you in regards to like don't listen to the
depression the anxiety the thoughts in your head do what you think is a good thing to do you know
yeah yep and and if if you are one of those uh one of those that are that are caught upon
sorry called upon to just be a listener
we beg of you we beg of you be a good listener be an active listener and and that doesn't mean
you you have 10 000 opinions that doesn't mean you're suggesting anything that just means you're
actively listening and whether it's like physically taking notes or you're just tucking
things back in your brain where the next time like if it's david and i the next time i talked to
david i'm gonna ask so you know i know last time david we talked about this how are you feeling
man where you at you know and be that active listener and be be like participate in it without
talking and and i know in 2022 that's hard to do that's hard to do um but but be that active
listener be that that that listener that participates without speaking
yeah i think that's the best way i can say it
deep we always get deep on deep drinks podcast that's what we do even when it was meant to be a fun
um mark around interview um showing off your new album we always end up going deep and that's
for our love about it
uh yeah well you you know me you didn't and i think most people uh listen watch watch later
if you're familiar i i'm i'm not afraid of these conversations i embrace i embrace these
conversations and i'm passionate about these conversations because uh what what in jenna says
i have no problems over the last year if it wasn't for ones like jenna and dr josh uh
and and others including and kath and others david i don't even know if i would like and i mean
this with every fiber i mean i don't even know physically i would still be here if if it wasn't
having those outlets and having those listeners that were that were just cool with listening
as as i vomited and puked and talked my shit and just got all that shit off my chest and
off my shoulders i don't even know if i would actually fucking be here right now today talking
about album having this conversation with you if it wasn't for having that support system
and the those listeners right and and that's why i'm i'm i am i'm 100 invested in in that
conversation and normalizing uh the conversation around mental health uh and and and fuck the
the the stigma fuck the stigma because we don't tell uh i said this early today we don't we don't
tell um diabetics to just faith through a muscle through it man up toughen up fuck your
insulin fuck your insulin we don't say that yeah exactly we don't say that shit
we do not say that shit so what why do we do that with people uh or what do we
as a society what why do we do that to people that you know that have mental health
uh or sorry mental illness diagnosis but any hoots i could literally talk about that for
four hours so i'll stop so uh let's let's move on next song it's gonna make a little more happy
okay so uh the the last three here um and that sounds like a long time but it's not because
they're they're they're shorter songs but uh these are the the the three singles that have dropped
that you can purchase on itunes um and we're gonna start with uh and i know jenna always loves
this but this this is a song that i wrote for and to jenna my my best friend my partner
finally and clad brider die um yeah that this was written for her and it's called on your mind
tell me what you think

no no no no like that's one of those things was like you just if no matter what and i won't even talk about why i wrote it that way but if you just listen to this everybody has been through like a break up everybody's lost a friend that you thought was a best friend ever ever like everybody's been through something like that right and those lyrics are
you can apply that to most people's experiences life where it's like no no no you thought it would hurt me no no no you thought you're no no no but like i'm still good i'm still good i'm still fighting i'm still going on no no no
awesome
so is there are there any tracks on the album that you haven't shown anyone except for maybe Jenna that people should look out for when they pre order the album
oh
see i feel like if i say this then i have to hear it
yeah there there's
you need to give them a hook for for to look out for when a album comes out yeah there's there's a track it's called you did
you did okay
and it's one of the i think three tracks on the album where it's all inter it's
very precisely intermingled but i'm talking to my two ex-wives and my mom at the same time
and
yeah you you did that that's the one
it's a banger it's a banger but it also it's if you listen to it don't listen to it one time you gotta listen to it like two or three times and you're like holy fuck
now i now i'm getting it i'm i'm getting it i hear what he's saying
so it's one of those but but it's also the the beat the beats nasty so
awesome
so
what's the best listening experience so am i listening to this like let's say when the album comes out and i'm like all right time to like i want to give this the best
like i know at the start of the offsprings album smash they say sit back in a chair grab glass of wine and relax and listen to these smooth melodies
what's the best listening experience for this am i driving in a car down down the street am i sitting in my house in my playing video games am i listening to it with like a good pair of headphones like how do you envision someone listening to this
that's a great question
man
as a complete body of work i would say that this is one where
it's either in in your car in your car on the way on
not on the way to work like not on the way home but you have you have a long drive ahead of you and
you you you you want to have an experience with the music
that would be it
or if you're one that you just love to put headphones on or put earbuds in and just lay back
kick your feet up and just listen to a story
i think those would probably be the two best ways to listen to the album because it is from number one to number seventeen it is a story
it is a story
it is a story and it's it is an experience
and not just random ass fucking tracks just thrown on an album
so if anyone from this stream ends up going on it for a car ride or and like actually people who do pre pre-order this and then you know actually listen to it within the first few weeks of coming out
send make a little video and send it to Oz on twitter make sure you let him over you from deep drinks i'm sure he'll appreciate it
yeah yeah
so and the last question because you've been on once before so my main questions like afterlife and all this kind of stuff and what he talked about and i recommend if people want to hear more about you on Oz's journey especially that growing up deconstructing his faith things like that the other episodes of banger as well
but the last question i do want to ask you is just for a touch on future projects
great question
and i apologize i do live downtown here in fort Wayne right next to a fucking train track
it'll go by in a minute but is your next album going to be called wrong side of the track
wrong wrong or right side of the track at this point it's all loud
it's all loud it's all loud the loud side of the track
because i've already started working on project number two because now now i'm in the mode i'm in the mode i'm in the mode anyway
yeah i've already started working on the next project and it is titled osmosis and it it's it's it's it's it's a complete evolution
uh into where i'm at now and what i'm feeling as far as just the
the like i've dropped all that shit right like i've dropped all that shit and i've got to talk about all that shit and and and work through all that shit and and now this is me this is me and that's
sorry this is where i'm in
where i'm at in the headspace that i'm in so the intro is there but like i said earlier the
track number two after the intro it's called welcome to my matrix and it's it's a completely different vibe than anything i have on this album
uh in the intro is actually to it the intro is nasty the intro is it's to a dubstep beat and and i'm literally also tackling like artistically
i've had people tell me well you can't rap to this beat you can't rap to this style you can't so i literally took a dubstep beat and i fucking murdered it
david
do you just tell them look out because you're gonna fucking rap to a dubstep beat
yeah that's all i said was look out and i didn't say another word i just said look out
but no it starts off with a dubstep beat and it goes into a chant at the end of it and i'm like no everybody told me i can't do this everybody told me that no you can't as a hip-hop artist you can't do this and i'm like fuck you
again i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do it and i'm gonna do it and i done i done did it david i done did it
that's awesome well my little puppy's come to say hi um or dog or goodbye but um but it's been an absolute um absolutely awesome having you on again and listening to your album and getting a few sneak peeks um everyone make sure you go check out the album uh it's on
apple music oh it's on spotify and it's on sound cloud so it's cool that you got like consistent branding with your logo and stuff it looks awesome
so as you can see we listen to this over and over again i want to say that that's shout out to jennan jennan jennan is the genius in the artwork does jennan do marketing for a job
she should she should yeah she definitely don't even get me started do not even get me started uh but uh no she's the she's the brilliance and the genius and uh what makes all of this look look fucking amazing she did she's got all the artwork so
i've been doing um i work in marketing and have done for like five six years i've got a post grad degree in marketing and i would hire jenna in a heartbeat because she knows she's way better at all the stuff than i am so so yeah jenna you're the best
i agree this i agree we should next next time you're on we'll just talk about jenna the whole time um jenna has told me everyone for those um for those who are interested in um learning jenna's story is when she moves out to indiana she's going to come on deep drinks and tell her story so that's going to be awesome stream as well
but um thanks so much all for coming on uh thanks everyone for showing up it's uh i know it's probably late there in the us what time is it where you are was
well it's it's two thirty and and for those that uh are up on the step uh i'm probably going to go dive back into my d jin shit because i have a show this friday so i have to practice um so you can hang out but yet tang tang gang tang gang
