Is, Christianly, a cult of the dead?
I would say a definitive yes to that.
First of all, let's interrogate that word cult.
I know that our minds go straight to the Jim Joneses
and David Koresh's of the world.
Think of the word agriculture.
It means care for the fields.
Think about the word culture.
It means both the cuisines, the arts, the music,
the literature that a particular people care most about.
So the cult of the dead is the Christian care for the dead.
And what this book is about is all of the material,
literary, ritual, architectural, chronological practices,
whether you're talking about a day on a calendar,
a sermon preached in honor of that saint,
a shrine, a relic, an actual physical domain.
All of these ways in which Christians
care for their holy dead, their very special dead.
