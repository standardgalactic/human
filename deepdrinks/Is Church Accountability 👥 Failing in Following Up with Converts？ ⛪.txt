but even like inner peace and the ability to be strong
in your faith through the witness of Holy Spirit.
Like there are some things that even are biblical
that are promised in these kinds of alter call settings.
And I just like, where's the church's responsibility
of falling up with these people?
Now, some churches I know do,
there are discipleship classes,
they have check-ins where they call these people
two or three times, they don't answer,
then they drop off at some point.
But it is absolutely astounding to me
that you can stand on a pulpit every Sunday,
make these kinds of amazing claims,
insane, miraculous level claims
about what will happen with people.
Same thing with healings, demonic possession,
all of these things.
Who follows up with that person a month later
when they're in the exact same spot?
