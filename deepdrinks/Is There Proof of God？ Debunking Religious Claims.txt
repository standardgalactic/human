Because at this point if you try to go give me proof that looks like pretty good proof of a Catholic God or a Mormon God or any Christian God,
my initial response is going to be figure out what the scam is because there's so much evidence it's not true now,
that it can't be true, that I would now need to know how I was either being fooled right now or how I was fooled with mountains of evidence
before that it couldn't be true.
