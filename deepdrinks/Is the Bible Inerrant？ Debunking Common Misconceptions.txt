In some regards, we're close to running out of rope, where it's such common knowledge
thanks to the internet.
Some of these issues, like the forgery of the Pauline epistles, that you have to take
a stand at some point of, this Bible is nowhere near inerrant, it can't be, and thus I now
have trust issues, and I have good reason to speak out against the validity of the Bible.
Or you have to accept some things that our modern morals say are unacceptable, like the
disparaging of women.
You have to fall on one of those two sides in this particular issue, and there's thousands
of issues like this.
