sex should only happen when it's necessary to keep down the urges, as the great poet
Ned Flanders once said. And so Paul's sexual ethic is just bizarre and also has no relevance
to how we understand sexuality today. And so I would say that the Bible does in its
own little specific ways that are not generalizable to all homosexuality and not even generalizable
to all acts of same-sex intercourse. They do condemn it. There are a ton of things that
we just decided, eh, and not for us anymore. From beginning to end, the Bible is perfectly
happy with slavery and even endorses it explicitly. We decided that wasn't for us anymore. And
so we now consider slavery, many Christians would consider slavery a sin.
