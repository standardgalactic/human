Which, oddly, includes something that virtually no translations of the Bible include today,
known as the Johanin Kama, which is in 1 John 5 verses 7 and 8, where it says,
There are three that agree in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit,
and these three are one, and there are three that agree in earth, the Spirit, the blood,
and the water, and these three agree.
Rasmus, in his day, already knew that that reading probably wasn't original to the text.
It wasn't in his Greek manuscripts. It was in some Latin manuscripts, but some late
Latin manuscripts, and he said, I'm not including this unless somebody
produces a reliable Greek manuscript that has this reading,
and he was getting a lot of pressure from people to include it, and lo and behold,
suddenly somebody comes up with one, and so he reluctantly adds it to the third edition
of this textus receptus, which is the edition that informed the editions that were used by the King James Tran.
