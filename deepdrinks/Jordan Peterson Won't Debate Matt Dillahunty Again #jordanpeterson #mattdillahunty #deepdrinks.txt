Is it true that Jordan Peterson won't debate you anymore?
Well, it seems to be true.
Basically, while we were since while we were finishing up on stage, he said he'd be
happy to have another conversation with me.
And then the second the debate was over, he bolted off the stage, went and
locked himself in his dressing room.
And what I was told is that his manager, publicist, whoever basically said, you
should never do another event with that guy.
And so I haven't heard anything from Jordan Peterson since that night.
