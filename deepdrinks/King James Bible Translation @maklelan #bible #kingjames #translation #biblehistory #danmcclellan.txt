King James Bible is not a significant departure from the tradition that followed it, which
I think a lot of people don't understand. A lot of people think things were taken out,
things were added in, there were drastic changes made, and that's just not the case.
So the King James Version technically is not a translation. It is a very conservative revision
of the Bishops Bible where they literally took copies of the Bishop Bible, gave them to the
translators, and they scratched out the words they didn't like, and wrote the words they wanted
in the margins. Now they consulted with source texts so that they knew they were on the right
track, but they were not translating from scratch by any stretch of the imagination.
