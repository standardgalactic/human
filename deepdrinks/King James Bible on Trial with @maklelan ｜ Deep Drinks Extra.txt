Moving on to the 1611 edition of the King James Bible, what was the state of Christianity,
the English-speaking state of Christianity at the time, right before the King James
was published?
So King James came to power in 1603 and it was the Hampton Court Conference the next
year where a guy named Reynolds, John Reynolds I think was his name, proposed a new translation
of the Bible as a means of trying to unify the church because the church was in a bit
of disarray.
It had only been, it hadn't even been 100 years since Henry VIII left the Catholic
Church because the Pope would not annul his marriage to, I believe, Catherine of Aragon
and created the Church of England and there were attempts to kind of return to Catholicism
and then those attempts were abandoned and then we had attempts to kind of establish
what the Church of England is going to be and it was kind of midway between Catholicism
and a pure Protestantism but you had people trying to pull it more towards Catholicism,
you had people trying to pull it more towards pure Protestantism, the Puritans wanted it
to be more Protestant and then after King James you had the development of the Anglicanism
and so King James is coming right in the middle of this and so there are a lot of fractures
in the church and one of the points of the Hampton Court Conference was to try to give
the Puritans the sense that their concerns were going to be addressed.
King James had no intention of actually satisfying any of the Puritans' ideas.
He actually pulled the church a little more in a Catholic direction but one of the things
that was approved was this idea for a new translation of the Bible and there had already
been translations of the Bible into English that had been in circulation.
Since 1525 is Tyndall's translation of the New Testament into English, the first one
that was done directly from a Greek source text and then by 1535 you had Miles Coverdale's
translation of the full Bible which was basically taking what Tyndall had done with the New Testament
and a chunk of the Old Testament and then Coverdale himself translated the rest of the
Old Testament from Latin and from German and from other languages because he did not
know Hebrew.
So 1535 is the full first Bible published in English translated mostly from Greek and
Hebrew and Aramaic source texts and then we have other Bibles that are being produced.
The Geneva Bible is the one preferred by Puritans and the Geneva Bible was kind of the foil to
King James and in part because it made a big deal out of the fact that the people of God
should have no king except God.
So there was a lot of anti-monarchic rhetoric in the way the text was translated in the
explanatory notes and so when King James approves this new Bible, one of the rules that he lays
down pretty quickly is that there will be no explanatory notes apart from whatever is
absolutely necessary in order to understand the underlying source language and so this
was a way to kind of cut the anti-monarchic tenor out from under the legs of the Puritans
and the King James version is a very conservative revision of a text called the Bishops Bible
which was originally published in 1568 and there had been several printings but they
literally took a bunch of copies of, I believe it was the 1602 or 3 edition of the Bishops
Bible, sent the copies out to the translators and they literally just scratched things out
and wrote what they wanted to be there in the margins and so there were not a ton of
changes made, it is very, very faithful to the source texts, it didn't really change
King James Bible is not a significant departure from the tradition that followed it which I
think a lot of people don't understand, a lot of people think things were taken out, things were
added in, there were drastic changes made and that's just not the case. So the King James version
technically is not a translation, it is a very conservative revision of the Bishops Bible where
they literally took copies of the Bishops Bible, gave them to the translators and they scratched
out the words they didn't like and wrote the words they wanted in the margins. Now they consulted
with source texts so that they knew they were on the right track but they were not translating
from scratch by any stretch of the imagination. Wow, that's actually something that I found very
profound. So before the 15, I forgot the exact date, sorry the first Bible in English did,
well even then I guess or even after that, did people have Bibles in their homes or was it mainly
like you were taught the Bible from the pulpit and you had to trust what the priest's interpretation
or how they were reading it, like how did the average person interact with this text? Well the
average person was never going to be able to afford a Bible because of how much work it was to produce
it. Prior to the printing press it was just obscenely expensive but the church had also
since the Reformation tried to put a stop to what they called vernacular translations of the Bible.
So translations into local languages and English was considered one of these vernaculars and so
yeah usually the only time they heard the the text was during some kind of liturgical reading when
it was being read publicly in a church or when they were getting passages recited to them by
the clergy, the priesthood. So it was not something that someone sat down in the evening and read
right before rolling over and go to bed, going to bed. So for the first 1500 years or so did like
well at least for the English speakers, people who didn't speak the original languages or have
access to these manuscripts or even for the majority of people, their theological understanding
would be very limited, wouldn't surely? Yeah it would be limited. A lot more people went into
the clergy than today and you had a lot of people in monasteries. In fact one of the things that
happened under the Church of England is almost immediately Henry VIII went through and shut
down all the monasteries and confiscated their lands and their money and things like that and
that ended up putting somewhere around two or three percent of the population out of a job
and in many cases displays from their homes and so there were not, yeah the regular person on the
street would have a very different understanding that would be primarily informed by the kinds of
conversations that they would have with others around them and that they would hear from their
clergy but there were a lot more clergy around so I think they were a little closer to the
source of that kind of discourse than most people are today but yeah they did not usually have
direct access unless they had the education to have direct access which was limited to the elites of
society. Wow so you've mentioned that they you know as part of what they used to translate
the King James but what are the other I guess ancient sources they used to check alongside that?
So there was a medieval edition of what we refer to as the Masoretic text that they used to
consult for the Hebrew Bible what they referred to as the Old Testament and the Masoretic text is
a version of the Hebrew Bible that was produced by medieval scribes who lived in the Galilee region
that we refer to as Masoretes and they kind of had purview over the way the text looked and the
notes that were used and so there was a an addition of that a single manuscript of that that they used
but for the Greek New Testament for centuries all that you had was the Vulcan which was a Latin
translation executed by Jerome around 400 CE and one of the things that catalyzed the Reformation
was the sudden availability of a Greek edition of the New Testament that was produced by a Dutch
humanist scholar named Desiderius Erasmus who was producing his own edition of the Vulget and in
order to kind of show his work he decided to put the Greek side by side with the Latin
and at the time there had been kind of a race to see who could produce a Greek edition of the
New Testament and Erasmus went to his library in Switzerland said gimme all the New Testament
manuscripts you got which amounted to seven the earliest one was from the 12th century
CE so a good thousand years after our earliest manuscripts of the New Testament and he cobbled
together an edition of the Greek New Testament and published that and that became wildly popular we
now refer to this as the Textus Receptus which means the received text and the second edition of his
Textus Receptus is what Martin Luther used to produce his translation into German of the New
Testament his third edition is what was used by the King James translators so their revision of
the bishops bible's New Testament was compared with the third edition of Erasmus's Textus Receptus
or wait no that's yeah it was based on the third edition I'm sorry Tindall used the third
edition the King James translators used an edition that was based on the third edition
which oddly includes something that virtually no translations of the bible include today
known as the the Johanine comma or the Johanine comma which is in first John chapter five versus
seven and eight where it says there are three that agree in heaven the the father the word and
the holy spirit and these three are one and there are three that agree in earth the spirit the blood
and the water and these three agree now that Erasmus and his day already knew that that reading
probably wasn't original to the text he can't it wasn't in his Greek manuscripts it was in some
Latin manuscripts but some late Latin manuscripts and he said I'm not including this unless somebody
produces a reliable Greek manuscript that has this reading and he was getting a lot of pressure
from people to include it and lo and behold suddenly somebody comes up with one and so he
reluctantly adds it to the third edition of this textus receptus which is the edition that informed
the editions that were used by the King James translators and so that is in the King James
version even though even when it was originally being produced they knew that wasn't a part of
the original text so there are relics of this another interesting variant reading the last
half of the last chapter of revelation Erasmus didn't have a Greek manuscript the manuscripts
were cut off right before the end and so what he did was take the the vulgit and back translate
into Greek and then he wrote that in the column for the Greek and one of the things that was in
the vulgit was a misreading of a the word um legno for a tree and he read misread it as
Libro for a book and so in Revelation in the King James version it talks about people whose names
are written in the book of life which is a misreading the Greek very clearly says names that
are written in the tree of life and so there are a handful of variant readings that the King
James version preserves because of problems with the way that Erasmus put together his manuscript
wow um I don't know if this is possible but if I was to graph out like visually I'll probably do
this in the editor or something but could you talk about the I guess the I don't even know what the
word is like lineage I guess not lineage but like Jesus look for the New Testament like Jesus spoke
in Aramaic and then that was translated into Coiny Greek and then that was translated into
um the the vulgate Latin Latin and then that was used for the Bishops Bible and that was used
for the King James could you like step that out or is that not yeah it's it's it gets a little
complex but I can kind of simplify it so we we have the tradition regarding Jesus preaching
in Aramaic our very first manuscripts of the New Testament the original manuscripts were all written
in Greek there's not really a good case to make that anywhere written in Aramaic and then translated
into Greek so the language of the New Testament is Greek we have the New Testament being translated
into Latin second third centuries that's called the old Latin Jerome around 400 CE kind of
retranslates and creates what became known as the vulgate which was considered the official
translation for a long time up until around 400 CE Christians considered the Septuagint the ancient
Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible to be more authoritative than the Hebrew in fact you have
folks like origin of Alexandria and others who are accusing Jewish people of having changed the
text of the Hebrew Bible to make it sound less Christian and then with Jerome you have this
shift to what they call the Hebraic of Veritas that we're going to return to trusting the Hebrew
even though his vulgates is in many ways dependent on the Greek but after that you get translations
in the following centuries into Syriac you get translations into Gothic languages into Ethiopic
into other languages like that you start to get translations into English that aren't really full
translations but kind of interlinear where you would take a Latin manuscript and they would
write the English translation of each word underneath in a handwritten script in the medieval period
around the end of the 14th century we have what's known as the Wycliffe Bible which was not translated
entirely by Wycliffe but was influenced by Wycliffe and the movement that Wycliffe started
but that was translated into English from the Latin and so it's not until you have the production
of Erasmus's textus receptis that you begin to see people translating into other languages
vernacular languages first Luther with German and then Tyndall with English directly from
the Greek edition of the New Testament that had been produced by Erasmus and then slowly
with Coverdale Tyndall was able to translate some of the Hebrew Bible from Hebrew Coverdale
didn't know Hebrew but later translators you have the Matthew Bible you have the Geneva Bible
you have the Great Bible you have the Bishops Bible these are going back and consulting the
manuscripts in Hebrew and in Greek however the tradition that is still somewhat connected to
the Vulget from Coverdale's use of the German and the Latin is still influential and so there are
some ways that the King James version and the Bibles that came before it rely on some of the
traditional readings from the Vulget but yeah once you get to around 1516 with Erasmus's
Greek New Testament suddenly there's an explosion of new translations into English
that are going back to the original Greek and the original Hebrew and Aramaic this is one of the
things that the Reformation is is really concerned about and this is one of the reasons that we
have the production of the Apocrypha because the Vulget weaves all the Apocryphal texts into
the Hebrew Bible they are not separate texts but they're parts of these texts like Daniel
is a lot longer in the Vulget and you have other books that are longer and what Martin Luther does
is notices these aren't in the Hebrew editions of these books these come from Greek and Latin
manuscripts and so I'm going to separate them out and I'm going to put them in their own little
section and so everything that he was not finding in the Hebrew manuscripts but were in the Vulget
he was moving into a separate section which he called the Apocrypha and the debate about this
resulted in the Catholic Church recognizing those passages as what they call Deutero canon
recognizing that the canon established within the Hebrew manuscript traditions is different from
their canon and so they're going to recognize a tiered kind of canon and Deutero canon
and so Luther separates out the Apocrypha and Luther actually wanted to get rid of a lot of
other books as well like James like Hebrews like Revelation and none of that really took off but
what did stick was the separation out of the Apocrypha which was based on this return to
the Hebrew manuscripts rather than reliance on the Latin Vulget so I have a version it's up here
somewhere I got the 400 year like a line-for-line reprint of the original and something I noticed
in there was that they have like they left the printing mistakes in like the jots or like little
ink mistake source and things are there any mistakes in the original in the first printing?
Oh yeah there are a number of mistakes and there's a scholar named David Norton who's a very famous
scholar of the King James Version who has published a couple of books a short history of the King
James Version a textual history of the King James Version where he goes through and documents a lot
of the mistakes there were reprintings immediately like almost every year after 1611 somebody is
reprinting the King James Version and they're correcting mistakes and sometimes they're introducing
new mistakes and some of those mistakes never get removed and the 1769 is an edition of the King
James Version published by a scholar at Oxford named Benjamin Blaney and that became kind of the
standard that became known as the authorized version virtually all editions of the King James
Version today are based on Blaney's 1769 edition so it does not match up with the 1611 it has fixed
a lot of the printing mistakes but it has printing mistakes of its own that that it has introduced
we're not to the the point yet where we can use computers to compare and and check things so printing
mistakes are still in inevitability I grew up in a Protestant church we didn't have the apocryphal
or can you explain what's in there so the apocrypha is a designation is a set of text
that's Martin Luther kind of pulled out of the previous versions of the Old Testament the the
vulgar and these were texts that were found in the Greek Septuagint you'll recall that for the
first few centuries of Christianity they trusted the Greek Septuagint more than they trusted the
Hebrew and so the vulgar is based on the Greek Septuagint in a lot of ways and so it includes
some of the additions to books like Daniel and Esther and some additional books like Maccabees
and things like that these texts were considered authoritative within Hellenistic Judaism within
early Judaism occupied by Greek speaking Jewish people and so that is the tradition that is enshrined
in the vulgar what becomes authoritative within Judaism which is separating off from Christianity
sometime in the second century CE is what is found in the Hebrew manuscripts which does not include
things like Maccabees and these additions to Daniel and Esther and and other texts and so there's a
difference in the Jewish Hebrew tradition and the vulgar the Christian tradition and this gets
noticed by Luther when returning to the Hebrew which is considered authoritative so Apocrypha
just means hidden and it is the idea here is that these texts were not a part of the Jewish tradition
they're probably not considered or they probably shouldn't be considered authoritative now when
Martin Luther separated them them out that created a third corpus of scripture for Protestants you
had the Old Testament you had the Apocrypha and then you had the New Testament and the Apocrypha
is in the 1611 King James Version it was published by Protestants for centuries and it wasn't until
the 19th century when you had the British and foreign Bible Society in the UK and the American
Bible Society in the United States that were trying to share Bibles and spread them all over the
place the American Bible Society had the goal of putting a Bible in every home in America and I think
the they managed to place something like 500,000 Bibles in one year like they were very aggressive
but one of the things they did to make their printing and their distribution more efficient was
they began to produce Bibles that did not include the Apocrypha that just had the Old Testament and
the New Testament and by the end of the 19th century this became kind of the de facto
authoritative version of the Bible and so by 1900 Protestants had decided we don't need the
Apocrypha anymore and so it was a part of Protestantism for the majority of the existence
of Protestantism and only in the last almost 200 years has it been something that they considered
negotiable. Of the earliest manuscripts what do we have like when's the first complete I guess
copy of Mark or how late is that? That's pretty late we can cobble together almost all of Mark
based on the manuscripts and then the quotations from the patristic authors by about 300 CE but
we don't get a full copy until we get to what are known as the Great Unseals so Sinaiticus, Vaticanus,
Alexandrinus and these are mid to late fourth century into the fifth century CE
but we have and there are some manuscripts that include the majority of these texts so I think
we can probably account for pretty much everything by the third century CE but we don't have a
single manuscript that contains everything for Mark or Matthew or whatever until probably the
fourth century CE. Our earliest manuscript of any kind of any size is a little credit card size
fragment of I think 37 words from the book of John that is dated between around 125 CE to maybe 150 CE
so the closest we can get to and what we call an autograph the author's actual own text is
maybe 30 to 50 years but again that's a tiny little fragment of 37 words just a handful of verses.
Interesting so since the 1611 translation do we have better or like have new many
most of us I knew have earlier manuscript did have scholarship changed like we have better early
manuscripts. Absolutely we have better manuscripts particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries
there were a number of discoveries that were made of more ancient and more reliable manuscripts
and also manuscripts that we had known about but had been lost or had not been made widely available
became available so Vaticanus is one of those very early important manuscripts of the whole
Bible that was limited to people who had access to the Vatican library but that was made public
I think in either the 19th or the 20th century and we discovered a ton more we discovered Sinaiticus
one of the most important manuscripts in St. Catherine's monastery on the top of Sinai
and we continue to discover manuscripts and so today I think they put the number of Greek
New Testament manuscripts at like 5,800 however the majority of those the vast majority of those
come from like the year 900 or after so there are many many centuries after our earliest manuscripts
which are still are not very numerous but using computers using all the manuscripts that we
have found we have been able to reconstruct what we think is a much more faithful version of how
the New Testament probably originally looked and so that tradition that I referred to the
textus receptus originally produced by Erasmus that informed the translation of the Bible all
the way up to the King James version which became the most authoritative Bible in 1881
there was a new edition of the King James version not a printing but an actual revision that was
published the the New Testament at least that decided to step away from the textus receptus
tradition and create a new or use a new edition of the New Testament that had been created using
all these new manuscripts and that was called the revised version and it was controversial very
controversial because one of the things it did was omit some passages and so and down to today if
you look at newer translations of the Bible many of them will be based on our newer reconstruction
of the New Testament what we traditionally call the critical text that has recognized we have
several passages from the textus receptus that we now know were not a part of the original
New Testament and so rather than leave them in scholars just decided to take them out but to
maintain traditional versification so we don't throw everything off they just omit the verse
and so on social media all the time I run across people who just are bewildered by the fact that
their translation of the Bible has Matthew 17 go from verse 20 to verse 22 and they don't know
what's going on with with verse 21 and this is a passage that we now know was added to the text
of Matthew centuries later based on some scribe writing this passage in the in the margins and
then the next copy they've decided to incorporate the marginal note directly into the to the body
of the text and so this kind of throws a lot of people off and you have a lot of people who
very dogmatically adhere to the textus receptus and think no this is more reliable this is more
original this is a better manuscript and the data don't really support that so most Bibles today
are going to differ particularly in the New Testament from what we see in the King James version
we have more reliable readings and we have much better manuscripts today what are some of the
problematic verses in the King James outside of the 16 missing or missing verses in the
new translations well there there are passages that are not understood incredibly well and so the
translation is is something that we would disagree with now and there are times when it's a it's a
mixture of different things so one passage for instance in the in the epistle of Jude verse 22
there's only one chapter of Jude it says of some have compassion making a difference and this sounds
like and Jude is talking about we've got these these people stuck in who are causing problems
for the church and then we have of some have compassion making a difference and today we look
at that and we go oh this is telling us you know if we have compassion on these people we can make
a difference we can have a positive impact a positive influence on their lives which is a great
message but has absolutely nothing to do with what the King James translators were trying to say
because the phrase making a difference did not come to refer to having a positive influence
until around the year 1900 it's only been within the last century and a bit that people have used
that phrase to mean that prior to that making a difference meant making a distinction and so
originally the King James translators wanted to say have compassion on some people but be discerning
on whom and so we've wildly misunderstood that because of how much the language has changed
but additionally that phrase making a difference is translating what's called a participle a verbal
noun and in the textus receptus that participle is in the nominative case which means it is
something that is connected to the subject of the sentence we now know based on the critical text
that the earliest and most reliable manuscripts have that participle in the accusative case so it's
actually not associated with the subject it is the object of the verb so whoever is making a
difference making a distinction they're the ones on whom you're supposed to have compassion according
to the oldest Greek manuscripts and so most translations today will render something like
have compassion on those who are wavering because this make a distinction idea refers to a debating
I am trying to figure out I'm not sure or I am actually separating and so you have either have
compassion on those who are wavering or have compassion on those who have separated themselves
have compassion on those who doubt so you have a number of different ways that this is translated
today that is a total departure from how the James version has translated it
there are a number of places where there are questions of the the way the language has evolved
that lead to misunderstanding and there are ways that the overly literal nature of the King James
version has led to just incomprehensible English and I'm going to pull up one example so second
Corinthians chapter 2 verse 5 I have just always found this just impenetrable English it says but if
any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that I may not overcharge you all
and you can take as long as you want with that but you cannot make sense of it in anything
remotely approximating a way that is probably original to the Greek this is overly literal
this is just impenetrable English and the idea is actually a newer translation says if anyone
has caused sadness he's not saddened me alone but to some extent not to exaggerate he has
saddened all of you as well makes a lot more sense but this is a case where the King James
translators because the Greek was very difficult kind of defaulted to just translating it very
very literally rather than translating it in a way that was more clear and this is something
translators do if they don't know what something means they will frequently translate it very
literally and then leave it up to the reader to try to discern what on earth is intended
so you see that a lot in the King James version as well it's overly literal because it doesn't
know what it means and that doesn't help us at all we have no way of figuring out what it means and
second Corinthians I think is is infamous in the King James version for having a lot of that
impenetrable language
