First of all, I said to Nuri, I was like, look, I don't know if I can do three in the morning and she's like, I don't care and she just yelled at me and said that we're doing it three in the morning.
I was like, whatever. No, she didn't really. I had to convince her to do it this time.
Anyway, Nuri Khan is a human rights activist and ex-Muslim who is the brain child behind Holy Humanist, a YouTube channel that is guided by the mantra driven by intellectual honesty.
I love that mantra.
Nuri promotes conversations about Islam and human rights with a strong emphasis on women's rights.
Welcome Nuri Khan.
Thank you so much, David. It's a pleasure to be here.
And no, I definitely did not shout at him to do this at 3am.
I was actually so worried. I'm like, ironically, it's a very ungodly hour to be up.
But as you said, it's 5pm somewhere, right, David?
Yeah, exactly.
It's fine to day drink in Australia too, so that's a great thing.
Binge drinking is also a massive problem we have here, so cheers to that, David.
Cheers. What are we both drinking today?
I know I initially told you I would probably be having a glass of white wine on a Friday evening, but then this Spanish, the rioja caught my eye and I couldn't resist.
Awesome.
This was in the fridge. It's a chilled red wine.
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
Is it on the sweeter side, or is it quite...?
It is a bit sweet, yeah, which I wasn't expecting. I was like, ooh, that's interesting.
Yeah, so I'm excited for the free wine to kick in and hopefully it will.
My bar's going and I'll start being even more uncomprehensible.
Is that a word? Uncomprehensible?
Uncomprehensible, yeah.
It's kicking in.
It's definitely kicking in. I'm bad at the worst times. I used to say Camembert and Grand Prix.
Oh my god, David.
I was really bad.
Cool.
Everybody needs to talk about me and my really bad speaking skills, but we're here to talk about you, and so you're an ex-Muslim, so that's an interesting...
That's clickbait right there.
Can you tell us a little bit about growing up Islamic and just a little bit of your journey?
Yeah, so I basically grew up in England, and it was kind of like the usual immigrant Pakistani extended family setting.
Naturally, I was living with my grandparents as well, and they're obviously a lot more on the conservative and religious side.
And then my parents were kind of born and brought up here, so they were like first generation, like having the full on British experience.
So Islam was always like a massive piece of our identity growing up.
And as I was the first born and my grandfather was like the Imam of the local mosque, I naturally took such an interest in Islam anyway.
From the second you're born into Islam anyway, like as a newborn baby, the very first thing is that they whisper the call to prayer in your ear.
So basically, it's an expression in Islam where your entire life is between that call to prayer and your funeral prayer being read.
So that's your entire life is between that.
Yeah, it's crazy.
So yeah, so obviously you're taught that Islam is like the only way in the right way.
So after school, it was just like completely assumed that every day I'd go to mosque and attend Quran classes.
And that's effectively where I had my first like real encounter with Islam and we were reading the Quran in Arabic.
That was actually quite good of them because that was the only time in my life where as we were reading in Arabic, they'd given us a small green book with English translations.
But again, it was like in proper like Shakespearean English, you know what I mean?
So it was very like I tried to decipher it even then.
I was nine years old by the time I was like heavily going to these Quran classes at the mosque.
And then again, like because my Quran teacher and all the girls and the women that would come there were all covered as in they wore hijab.
I realized that this is a massive tenant of Islam for women.
So I decided like, oh, I also want to go to heaven and like I definitely want to abide by Allah's commands.
So I decided to put it on even though nobody in my actual household wore hijab, which again as a child really weirded me out because I know a lot of people and we can talk about what's happening recently as well and well developments with the hijab.
But most people's story is that, you know, their pressure to put it on.
I was weirded out because I was pressured like when I was was like trying to put it on and say, you know, this is the choice that I've actually made for myself.
If Allah wants it, I want to go to heaven.
Therefore, I want to be a good Muslim woman and do what I'm supposed to do.
I'm of that age now nine is a very special age in Islam for a Muslim woman.
So yeah, they were like, are you sure?
But are you sure?
And then later on as I progressed, I was really into sports and I started playing football and it just became a nightmare.
But they were actually so happy when I took it off.
And obviously there's underlying cultural nuances within that.
Like my grandmother wanted me to have more marriage options.
So she didn't want me to limit myself to somebody very conservative.
So it's not really, it wasn't really driven for like, you know, this is not like a free and fair choice.
She's made by herself.
Like this is, you know, it's a tool of oppression.
It was more like, oh, is she going to get enough suitors?
Yeah, that's amazing.
I remember having a similar experience where I asked my mom in my teenage years.
My family is so open.
We talk about sex and everything like it's totally okay.
Wow.
And I said, I said, mom, I said, I was, you know, religious.
And I said, mom, doesn't, you know, doesn't, is it a sin to have sex before marriage?
And she says, she goes, well, yeah, kind of.
But yeah, it is.
But you know, like you can do other stuff like there's not, you don't just have to have sex.
And I was like, but isn't that still sex?
And she's like, yeah, like, yeah.
And I'm like, and I'm thinking to myself like, wait, is it or not?
Like, I want to, I want to go to heaven.
Like I want to, I want to make the right, I want to worship and honor God with my life.
Like I don't, you know, and I was a Christian just for anyone who doesn't know.
And I remember being just so perplexed why, why my mom and why many people in my life would water down what the Bible says.
But then in the next breath, say it's the inspired perfect word of God.
And it was like.
So funny how lenient everyone's individual God is, right?
Like when it comes down to it, which is, which makes so much sense to me now because I think about it.
And I'm like, wow, everybody's view or version of their God is so like it aligns so much with their personality and their tendencies.
And you know, like genuinely, I've seen that.
And again, in Islam, I see this all the time.
I promise you, my grandmother and my mother vis-a-vis my everybody around me has their own version of Islam.
Oh, that's amazing.
Do you, before we go any further, do you?
I've got a recommended version of the Quran, but I've only read the Quran once.
Do you have a recommended reading for anyone who wants to read the Quran maybe for any reason?
I know that we're not going to be very pro pro Quran pro Islam in this discussion.
But do you have any preferred English translation?
Oh, I definitely have a preferred Quran for sure.
I was just going to grab it, but it's over there.
I wish I could show it.
Go grab it.
It's called the Woman's Quran and it's basically empty.
So that's the whole.
That's so good.
That's so funny.
And it's literally the quickest read.
And the first page says that this book is empty because the Quran is one of the biggest obstacles to women's emancipation.
And I, you know, wholeheartedly agree with that.
And you should see some of the things that my friends have filled it up with.
It's not pleasant.
Okay, okay.
That's amazing.
I love, I love that you've gone like you're full, you're badass.
Like you've gone full like, yeah, you know, human rights activists, women's rights activists.
Like I love it that you've just gone full like, no, fuck you.
Like, sorry for swearing.
Apologize for swearing.
But like no taking a huge stand against that.
Have you heard?
Sorry though, David, just to actually answer your question on a more serious note.
For me, again, when I started to try and read the Quran in English again in my book, in my house, it was some, you know,
some that we had the most in Khan translation with, which I think he is from Pakistan and that's quite a famous translation.
But again, a lot of it for I was, I was still a teenager at the time, a lot of it was going over my head.
What I found is when I actually went to Quran.com, which is literally at our fingertips.
If you go to that and then you look at the, I think it's James Pickett Hall translations are usually quite blunt and as organic as they can be because what we're seeing now, even on Quran.com and Sunna.com,
which is the home for like the main hadiths, the hadiths that have all passed like whatever criteria they have to be graded and the Sunnis technically should believe in them.
What we're seeing now is as times progressing and even videos that we've made a year ago, now the hadiths have like these new brackets inserted and it's all trying to be like watered down.
And they're trying to make it a bit more palatable because there's some very damning things in there, obviously.
But I would genuinely say go to Quran.com and if you are reading it flick through a few translations just so you can get the nuances of the verses because some of them have completely taken the leniency path and change things from like do not take Jews and Christians as friends and greet them and completely changed it to like do not take them as sponsors and it's like a sponsor.
So be careful with that but I would say cross check a few but Quran.com honestly is verified and it helped me get out.
I took it at face value, yeah.
Oh wow, that's great.
The translation that I read and I read this, I listened to the audio version because I tried to read like a version I picked up in like a plane, an airport bookstore and it was horrible to read.
But I got this one and it's actually by the King Fahd Professor of Islamic Studies in the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.
Oh that's my university, that's where I went.
Oh really? Muhammad Abdel Halam.
He wrote this one and it's a really beautiful book and it's actually really beautifully written in some spots.
Some parts made me want to…
Don't fall for it David, don't fall for it.
Trust me, I'm not falling for Islam.
But I have a deep respect for religion but only because I don't think it's true.
I think that religion is beautiful as long as you don't think it's true.
It's like when you see a toddler walking, you're like wow, good on them, they're walking.
It's like humanity's first steps of trying to understand the cosmos but it's like you wouldn't ever go put that toddler in a race with an athlete.
We've come so much further.
I look back and I'm like wow, this is interesting history and wow, people used to be this barbaric, wow that's crazy.
Oh that's a beautiful thought.
I don't think it's true but yeah.
Yeah, it's a great insight into our psyche as well at that respective time period and context and geographical location.
So back to your story, what branch of Islam were you in?
I know there's like Sunni and Shia are the main two sects.
What were you in?
I was Sunni Muslim.
So even if you were to ask like Pakistanis within Sunni Islam, there's like different sects in Pakistan,
especially like they're called Diobundis, Barelvis, a bunch of other ones.
And I always like when I speak in that to that crowd of people, I'm like oh my god, I didn't even know which one I was.
But apparently a lot of people don't.
So I was from like the most mainstream Sunni version of Islam basically.
So in that just for people, it's basically like you take obviously,
well every Muslim needs to believe that the Quran is the literal word of God,
but the Hadiths that I was referring to basically the telephone game of 1400 years ago
is like compiled into two major Hadith collections and they are on sunnah.com
and most Sunni Muslims also take.
So the Quran is the example, but also the Hadith is what's to be followed
because that's following the example of the Prophet.
Okay, interesting.
So would you say, do you know anything about Christianity at all?
I do.
Not nowhere near in depth is yours, but yeah.
Do you know any churches like where you were like the Hillsong of Islam
or was it like the Bethel of Islam?
Like do you know or was it like the Catholic of Islam?
Like which sect would?
Oh, the majority, the main one.
Yeah, definitely.
The one that everyone's like, yeah, okay, they're not like extreme.
The one that has the most numbers anyway.
There are more Sunni Muslims than any others
because even there's only certain countries that have majority Shia populations.
I think Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, maybe that's about it.
Like in Saudi Arabia where I grew up,
you can't like my school friends that were Shia,
you actually can tell from some of their last names,
but they would never disclose the fact that they were Shia
because they actually persecuted in Saudi Arabia.
So they actually go and pray more underground
because you can tell distinctly that the prayer style is different.
So Sunni Muslims would pray with their hands here
whereas Shia Muslims put them down by your side.
So they would actually be like singled out in Saudi Arabia.
So they would come up with their own, yeah.
Wow, that's interesting.
I know so little about Islam and this is all interesting.
I'm okay with that.
I'll call up David.
So when did you realize Islam was a problem?
Oh, wow.
I realized, so I left the UAE
because I was living there at the time
and I escaped from like a crazy situation.
But when I came back to the UK, I think in 2017 it was,
then I really started like doing my own research
and being like, no, no, no, wait,
let me see if this checks out.
Like how would the, you know, I basically,
I was on a mission to defend my faith
from what I had experienced in the UAE
because they had actually tried to like kidnap me in a sense
and like keep me hostage.
Yeah.
Can you go into that?
To me that is profound.
Like I can imagine that would happen in like North Korea
or something, but I didn't,
I didn't realize like Dubai, it would be like this, you know.
Oh yeah, you and me both.
Yeah, so just, just for your viewers,
basically I was,
I was living in the UAE and I got married
when I was quite young
and then like very quickly the marriage fell apart.
It just, there was like a lot of abuse there,
which first of all, I had no idea about abuse
or like how it manifests and what kinds of abuse there are.
So that was a huge learning curve
when I finally like realized, oh my goodness,
this is what's happening to me.
This is why I'm like turning into a,
like a shell of my former self.
This is why I'm having to watch TED Talks.
But basically I was married Islamically.
So in, and obviously if you haven't added that clause
into your marriage contract in Islam,
that you are able to have the right to divorce through courts
by default, you're not women
are not given the right to divorce in Islam.
So in wanting to pursue a divorce,
obviously if the other party does not want to let you go
or they don't want to grant you the divorce,
technically there's a certain Muslim countries have progressed
and they've got this thing called a khulla,
which happens in Tunisia,
which you can get in Pakistan,
and that effectively gives the woman the right
to go through the courts and say,
I want a divorce and usually it is granted.
But again, if somebody is even more like bitter
and conniving, which is what my ex partner did,
he basically employed a lawyer
and they picked up some ancient archaic sharia law,
which all comes back to the obedience of a pious woman
and obviously a pious wife.
So this law states that any woman who you fear disobedience from
or if you fear that she's going to leave the home or whatever,
there is, it's called that as al-jiya in Arabic
and it's still talked about more in Egyptian circles
and they've done entire like fatwas and discussions
and stuff on it.
But when this police officer in the UAE called me up
and said, we've got this order for al-jiya on you
and I was like, sorry,
I have no idea what you're on about, mate.
Like, can you explain what that means to me?
And then he basically said,
like we would,
you need to go back to your husband's house
and return there
and you cannot leave without his permission.
If you don't go back by this time and date,
we will arrest you and forcibly take you back.
So with like me obviously, yeah.
So you broke up with your,
well, you left your husband
because he was abusive, right?
And so you're trying to like stay away from your abuser essentially.
Exactly.
And the police told you you had to go back to your husband.
Yeah, and the police who basically like,
I mean, for the longest time,
I had been going to the station and reporting
because I had moved, bear in mind,
I had moved back into like the house of my parents.
I had got a new job.
I had essentially like moved on with my life
and I had filed for the divorce to be initiated.
But then obviously like found out
that he had been following me from work and back
and showing up at my workplace
or events that I was at after work
and my friends had spotted him or whatever.
So I had gone to the police many a time
and said like I'm being stalked and harassed
and somebody's constantly watching my window
and they didn't take any of that seriously at all.
Like to the point where I went as such a good respect
for Muslim women,
like I went in a buyer, you know,
and they actually are even more like toxic
and misogynistic.
They would just keep me there in a room with them
for like hours and just have like baseless discussions.
And then their colleague would come
and sit with me and talk about how,
and I was just, I mean, it was such a demeaning,
demoralizing process to have to go through that
like for weeks on end.
And I'm telling them about like serious issues
and safety concerns.
And they've got like the Arabic,
like miswakh,
which the prophet used to clean his teeth with.
And they're just like, but why?
Like why would he do that?
And they're just not concerned at all.
So the point where when it got very, very serious,
I had to call the emergency number
for British expats in Dubai
because I was like,
these people aren't ensuring my safety.
And the amount of things that he was doing,
I knew that there's incidents in Dubai where,
you know, if he's paid them off enough,
because he was really lurking around my area
and he'd kind of paid off all those police officers.
And if you do that enough
and you hand over your passport to them,
you can just end up as a number on their system.
And so yeah, they, like the police in Dubai
are not allowed to contact women
or arrest them after like 10 p.m.
They would call me at like 10, 11 p.m. at night
and just order me to come to the police station
and give over my passport.
And I was like, no, it's 10 p.m.
I'm not legally obligated as a woman
to come to a police station.
They came to my house as well.
They tried to catch me there
and try to take me again in the middle of the night.
And I used the Islamic laws on them.
And I said, well, my father, who's my,
in Islam, you have to have a mehrim or a guardian always
because you're not your own,
you don't have agency as a woman, right?
So it's either, now I've gone back for my husband,
so I'm with my father.
So he was actually away from the country on business.
And I said, you cannot take me
and forcibly remove me from my house
without my guardian knowing.
And then I also said, if you're going to take me right now,
let me call the British Embassy
because I need them to know that you've taken me.
And then they were like, okay, okay, no,
like you can come tomorrow.
And so that, and also they bought four male police officers,
which is what you usually do when you're trying to charge somebody
with like adultery or something so heinous like that,
that you have to trap them in your country.
So they were trying to charge me with that.
And again, I flipped the Islamic law on them
because I'd lived in the UAE for a couple of years.
And my friends and I would discuss the fact that, you know,
I used to think the UAE was so good and used to protect women.
So I knew for a fact that if policemen are coming to your house
after six PM, you're not legally obligated to go to the station with them in their vehicle
if there's not a police woman officer present.
And there wasn't because they were trying to like catch me in a thing for adultery or whatever
because again, my window was being watched.
So one day when I had lots of friends over,
they were like, let's take one and let's get him in the back of a car
and let's get her in the back of a car.
And I said, sorry, you've not got a police woman officer.
I'm not coming.
So between saying, yeah, it was madness.
And so was your ex-husband,
do you think he was trying to pay these police officers off
or do you think that they were just upset that you were trying to divorce someone
or like why are they putting so much effort into trying to ruin your life as it appears?
Yeah, I know that that's a great question.
I think it's a combination of both fast and foremost.
So there was like also some serious underlying mental health issues there
that I eventually like realized, right?
That's what you realize when you're living with somebody day in, day out,
you realize that their behavior has completely changed.
So what was all of it to begin with?
Was it a mask? Was it a front?
But once that kind of it starts to crumble before your eyes
and then I realized like trying to approach his own family to say,
hey, this is what I'm noticing and this is what I'm seeing.
Are you guys aware of this?
But when I realized the reaction from them when I told them was not like,
oh my God, like what's going on with our son or our brother?
It was more like a reaction of, oh shit, she's clocked or like she knows.
Oh no.
That's when I was like, I am up against, I don't know what here.
And you know, like, yeah.
So it was and so that drives a lot of things like trust me, Islam is again,
I was still a Muslim through all of this,
but the things they were doing because I had to go to like Islamic marriage counseling
before you can get a divorce.
He would say things like she's possessed with like there's like a gin inside me,
a gin is like an Islamic demon.
And like she needs exorcisms because she wants a divorce.
She's not thinking straight.
And I'm like, oh my, and then the counselor would say like,
how many times a day do you pray?
You need to pray together.
And then his family, when I'd obviously moved back to my own home with my parents,
I'd wake up to like potions of what is like done in Islam,
which is one of the biggest sins, but like black magic,
just concoctions of crap, like weird shit, like weird, weird shit.
And like, yeah, I'd just be woken up to seeing that outside my villa.
Like I had a little dog.
There was some weird, like creepy things that it was just, yeah, it was horrible.
Wow.
That's so, it's so bizarre to me.
Well, so did you.
So I guess the black magic didn't work because you.
Well, David, I actually stepped around it as opposed to.
Get to work.
So maybe you should still have had the desired effect.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, that's weird.
So this is more debunking black magic than anything.
Exactly.
Well, I got out and I got a divorce and I'm sitting here talking to you today.
So clearly it doesn't work.
Yeah.
Praise me.
Weird things in that.
Yeah, David, there was actually like there was like fish eyeballs and like weird,
weird things, like weird ingredients that you have to source to come up with this stuff.
That's crazy.
That's so, that's so weird.
I want to talk to some people who've done black magic because to me it's super interesting.
Like they do some really weird like cat's bones and like just random like.
It's like what you imagine like a.
Nail clipping weird shit.
Like a really dark, like a really dark five year old come up with like some like really messed up five year old.
Well, it's like, what's it?
What's it?
Let's do a potion.
And he's like, okay, you need a rainy day and you need a.
Yeah, like, you know, I always get reminded of like the witches and Macbeth, you know, and they're like,
what was it?
Something, something toil and trouble and they're like mixing.
Yeah, that's funny.
So, so were they so were they caught appointed or not caught appointed, but like law appointed marriage counselors that you had to go through official ones.
Yes, exactly.
So before they even file your application for divorce in the courts, they say, well, let's have some little counseling and lo and behold, it's the most like pious or outwardly looking pious misogynistic man.
They're trying to tell you that your abuse and everything you go through is just, you know what, you could still have go go and pray with him and then have a cup, like a cup of coffee in public.
Like trying to say, I do not even want to look into the eyes of this person anymore.
Are you hearing me when I say that thing is over there like things like mental health and personality disorders.
They would literally like they don't understand me saying that to them.
They are believing his stance more when he's saying she's possessed.
Therefore, she wants to divorce like they have no idea what borderline personality disorder is or how I'm about to go and start explaining it to them.
Right.
And again, just on a quick note, because you are Muslim by your name and whatever, your default law that you have to follow there is Sharia.
If you are Muslim, like you can you can then request to follow English law.
So that was my backup plan was to say, obviously I want to implement English law in this state because at least English law recognizes mental health and obviously abuse and things like.
Yeah, I mean, I work in that sector now here and I just see how completely vastly different the approaches here.
We're always trying to safeguard the victim and there it's like you're crazy because you want to leave your husband and we're going to make it healthy you to do so.
Yeah, right.
That's so is Sharia so is Sharia law different around the world or is it just one blanket thing.
So technically like Sharia has certain prescriptions like obviously for like you know adultery and thievery and stuff like this amputations and lashings and all of that but obviously the way it manifests in each individual country depends respectively on the country's history and
Like you know their relationship with Islam over the years so like in Pakistan it was the constitution and everything was a lot more secular and then we had this dictator come in Zia al-Hakq and he actually bought like the we call them hadood like the most strictest Sharia punishments which are include like which include amputations and beheadings and things like that he actually bought that into law and made it part of the constitution and therefore like the blasphemy law and all these things kind of like turned up a notch.
In countries like Tunisia as well Egypt, for example, where the law came out from where the one they put on me that is al-Jia.
That is very much still discussed in Egyptian circles but countries like Tunisia and Lebanon and places have completely progressed beyond that.
My shock was thinking and falling for the fast that Dubai was this crazy modern progressive wanting to attract western tourists and western investment kind of model so they would you know like as a Muslim woman because
Dubai the crime rates low you don't really get sexually harassed and things like that it really doesn't happen you live a really good life as an expat there so in your bubble of being a Muslim woman you think oh they're so nice like they protect.
Even the police officers the fact that they can't take you like I used to big that up is that so good of them.
It was just it was just a matter of time when I actually had to use that to like ensure my safety and freedom.
But yeah so it manifests quite differently in every country depending on on where they're trying to go that that also their case law and precedent and like what like some women have India for example triple to lack which is guaranteed in Islam for men it's actually like it's there it's codified a man just needs to say that.
The word divorce I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you three times and technically Islamically you are divorced or there's something akin to that as well if you say to your wife like oh you remind me of my you're the back of you looks like my mother or something she's also immediately divorced like this is weird.
I know it's so weird but yes so yeah so India then now has abolished triple to lack so that can't happen but if you are a believer this is the point I'm trying to make it like for example even in my situation because it was abusive like a Muslim man can like say like pronounce two of those divorces and then leave you hanging on the third one but if you genuinely believe in this faith.
Like when he pronounced the third one even then he's like oh that was a joke in my heart of hearts I thought to myself in God's eyes we're not married anymore.
Like it's just it's not but yeah so so that's obviously a thing that exists.
Okay this is yeah this is super interesting and I've just reposition myself in the chair you can tell a bit tipsy now.
So how much of this so I have one of my best friends is is Muslim but we it's fun call her best friend because we kind of like we came friends online and we like chat all the time she's not but so when we talk about like these things we talk about cultural differences rather than.
Quranic differences and the thing that I have always noticed that I think Islam has a specific problem with is Islam makes the decree that the Quran is explicitly from God perfect like it's not it's not written down essentially by man it's it's like word for word exactly what God said.
Where the Bible the Torah the Bhagavad Gita they don't have those problems.
And I sometimes wonder if if that one thing is what has stopped Islam from progressing like the other religions tend to have because like and just to just to I'm just going to read a little section of the Bible I carried through ministry college.
So just to be fun please yeah so so this was one of the scriptures that I read during I read to someone like a someone in my church and said like this is causing this on because this is a new testament scripture meaning that it's the new covenant instructions from Paul it's right up next to like all the other stuff that Christians like to quote.
And so these are instructions on worship one Timothy two verses and we'll start at verse eight.
I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger or disputing.
So that's the man part.
Now this is the woman's part.
I also want women to dress modestly and with decency and propriety not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes.
But with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
Now this is where it gets messy a woman should learn should learn in quietness and full submission.
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man.
She must be silent for Adam was formed first then Eve and Adam was not the one who was deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
But women will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith love holiness and propriety.
David to making my ears bleed.
No, no, no, no, no to all of the above.
No, just no serious before the Abrahamic God honestly he's so anti women like what is wrong with you.
Why create us honestly.
I know it's bizarre.
Hey, but this something like this is dismissed by Christians and I'll say well that was for a time.
You know, I still hate you know they still hate the gaze.
That's not for a time.
Yeah, but yeah exactly even though there's explicit instructions in the Bible to murder infants.
But it's and they're like they're alive infants too.
They're not even ones that are in the womb.
Yeah.
But this this one is dismissed all the time like you know you got you got Christian women pastors and things like that.
And I wonder like why can't Islam have because why can't Islam have the same thing.
Why can't Islam why can't Muslims be just as hypocritical as most Christians.
In fact, I think they are to be honest.
I think most just as hypocritical as most Christians but why why can't they why can't there be a reformation of Islam.
Do you think it's possible?
Well, honestly, I think you really hit the nail on the head where you said it because of the very fundamental claim of Islam which is that the Quran is the literal word of God like verbatim.
These are God's words.
So how do you go about reforming God's words and even if you were trying to reform God's words surely the first question that pops into mind is that God's words are meant to be infallible.
So how am I a simple human being here trying to like edit God's words like who who am I.
But again that it's even like the amount of exegesis they've had to do on every single Quran verse to try and make sense of it.
And some of them are complete mysteries to them still like there's certain parts of the Quran is one bit that says alif la meem and when you when you recite it you just say like alif la meem for the longest time.
Nobody knows what that's referring to like it's it's even the exegesis of it is just and then and now the now theories are coming out which make a lot more sense which takes a whole nother turn into like mantras and magic and masonry at the time and yeah that that's a whole nother episode in itself.
But yeah I think exactly on my views on Islam reforming are very similar to yours.
What I think is happening is that Muslims as people are reforming because they're having to keep up with modern times and the ones that live in the West especially are kind of forced to integrate on certain things now you can't be seen really in certain circles to still be homophobic because your Allah says you should be like you have got to look that gay couple in the eye and give them the same respect.
That you would give to any other human being regardless of what you're thinking inside like even if that's the case but I do think that Muslims are going to slowly become more progressive and tolerant.
I just don't think the scripture has any leeway for you to do that because the second you start to dispense of the scripture.
It calls into question the entire fundamental existence of Islam and it's very claims that it makes for itself I mean if you told me when I was a believing Muslim that you need to change the Quran or we need to just not believe in certain parts of it or by the way.
It sucks let's get rid of that I would be like who do you think you are and if that's the case then I need to seriously consider whether this allies who I think he is if we as humans are coming up with better stuff then there's a problem.
Yeah and I don't know if you have this in Islam but in Christianity it's like God's ways are above our ways you know like it's like it's just dismisses it all man's wisdom is folly to the Lord and it's like you can't really you can't really win.
Exactly so so why would you want to insert man's infallibility over what is meant to be the most perfect word of God anyway right.
But yeah we exactly the same thing we have the same concept like every Muslim through this and everywhere like a God works in mysterious ways it's all part of God's bigger plan and humans are created dumb like we're not privy to certain information that God knows.
So the Quran itself like deters you from thinking about the afterlife and sorry death and things like that it says all like matters of the soul and it's I'm not saying it how exactly it's written but I'm just paraphrasing but it says matters of the soul are basically beyond human comprehension so leave it to God.
And that's the kind of thing to just nip any critical thinking in the bud.
Yeah yeah exactly I love what you said by the way I just have to bring it up again I love how you say on your YouTube channel I had it written down for but driven by intellectual.
Driven by intellectual honesty so good because I remember the big thing a big thing for me I'm coming to terms with Christianity was realizing that that every one of my Christian teachers and family and friends and stuff weren't being intellectual.
When I brought them like tough questions they were being and it's fine if they didn't have the answer I probably would I might even still be a Christian probably not but it will take a lot longer but it's like it's it's.
It was the intellectual dishonesty it was the it was the it was me going this doesn't really feel right doesn't really make sense this is really uncomfortable for me.
And then people just wanting to dismiss it like wanting to be like oh God God's ways to rub our ways or yeah that's man sin man sin into the world so this is why you having you know and and I love that you just put it like that you know.
Well yeah because honestly David I love that you've actually touched on this because I don't think I've actually talked about this with anybody as to why that was the first one that came to my mind when I was like okay let me actually start speaking about Islam because it's so problematic.
The only reason I was able to get out because I look at my peers and people around me and my friends and then they're educated to the same degree that I am right my parents are very well educated like everybody around me is it must have these thoughts but the only reason I was able to actually get out is because I followed those signs from what I read in the Quran.
What I read in the Quran then I verified with the Hadith and I looked into the Prophet's life then I like kind of put everything together then I searched it online myself.
I watch videos from both sides and I was literally just letting my mind do its thing but I was following the evidence and I wasn't burying my head in the sand for the first time when I saw something.
I for the first time gave had an adult conversation with myself and I said Nuria you're going to read this book you're not going to read it like you tried to read as a teenager or you thought it was like the most amazing thing like it's almost too sacred to even touch when you're a child.
Without all the bias of this being like I used to sit there as a teenager and be like when I'd open the ground I'd be like God is talking to me now I'm about to converse with God.
But when I actually went through that stuff in Dubai and I came back and I'm like literally with a legal mind I'm like how did they put this law on me and I was like oh my God.
That's so clever legally I got you too like that works that checks out and have a hard time defending it and then I was like no how again back to the thing being the Quran is unspoiled untouched by man supposedly according to Islamic theology.
So for me when I saw that in the Quran when I saw wife beating was sanctioned when I saw the treatment of women.
It was such a big red flag because I was like Allah hates me Allah hates my kind literally the guy hates me like why create me why should I bow down to you when you're saying my worth is less than this man next to me like are you for real.
Does the Quran or does Islam have a literal monetary value of worth less because I know in Judaism and Christianity women are literally worth less like that's like if a female slave dies it's like 50 shekels if a male slave dies it's like 150 shekels or something.
It's like some number or if a daughter dies versus a son dies it's like literally monetarily different.
Well David house this so in a court of law if you and I were up against each other your testimony would be considered full mine would be half.
So there's that and second of all if you're a son yeah go ahead is that just a culture thing or is that an.
This is Sharia this is Sharia a woman is one half of a man and then Mohammed is so kind enough to elaborate on why that is for us and he says it's because women are deficient in three things religion intellect and something else.
Religion of piety intellect and something else where in the majority of us are in hell because we answer back to our husbands so all of this is because he's saying a woman is deficient in intelligence therefore you are not able to stand your ground in a court of law and have enough agency.
You need another woman lest you forget you need to be reminded and you know egged on by this other woman to equal a man.
Not just that but inheritance rights as well a son gets half and then a woman gets like half of that so yeah it's all over the shop.
It's all fair I am I have a similar I think our brains must be similarly wired because I have I did a similar thing to you but my thing was young of creationism so I remember I remember looking at young of creationism finding that.
Oh the Bible kind of add that if you'd add up the dates in the Bible it adds to the earth being 6000 years old what about biology biology and human evolution or 6000 years old sorry.
And and I was like I'm going to research this and I just pulled up this document and I haven't opened this for a long time but this was 2016 or 2017 and it's called the objective truth of origins so I don't know if you can see that.
But it's like I say in like in order to get as close as possible to an objectively truthful view of reality will live in and for the purpose of this document I have mentally done all is in my power to put aside my personal spiritual cultural or emotional beliefs with the understanding that any truthful worldview will have evidence to reach those conclusions without my justification.
So I was I wasn't worried that I wasn't worried about it not arriving at God because I believe God was true so I was like I can follow the evidence where it leads and then I went on to just research like papers after papers after papers after papers after papers after papers on every subject and just link to them.
Wow just so just so just so I can get to the bottom the bottom of it because I was like okay well like let's let's really look at this like if is if human if we evolved from a common ancestor and then obviously there'd be evidence for it and obviously there's there will be no evidence for it and then when I looked at it I was like oh there is evidence for it.
So amazing what you can find out on the internet isn't it David.
If you go to the right sources but that's the same thing what you're saying before about doubting the Quran it's the same thing with Christianity in that young with creations will say you know Jesus spoke about Adam and Eve so if you're doubting what Jesus said and what Jesus believed then why not doubt everything else it's in the Bible to Jesus really die on the cross like it makes and a lot of people like can ham of answers and Genesis and so they believe it's like a plot of Satan.
To to deceive the world like to see oh yeah by leaving like footprints of evolution and stuff right to like test our faith as well.
Yeah yeah exactly the devil put or like a lot of my like is the devil put put the fossils there to trick us to see if you fell for it.
My goodness.
No but also I really I'm so grateful that you touched on the intellectual honesty part as well because I think when I did do that subliminally at some point it was a little bit of a dig to be like let's face the facts here because those are my first few videos as well like all I tried to do because I know if I could sit you down in a one to one context and I would present you with that source and you had nowhere to run or hide.
You would be as literally as disgusted and like sure as I was but all you're doing is trying to close your eyes and be like la la la la la la la like it's just leave me be in my state which I will but that was the whole initial initial thing of my channel.
I'm like mate this is purely intellectually honest here's the source what do you think because that's what I think that means yeah I love what you said that like we I think we have the same brain because I love what you said that because I've literally I've had that fantasy.
A million times where it's like I wish I could just get this person and like lock them in a room and we and like we're both locked in this room and we define terms and we have to we have to agree at the end of this conversation on this like we're reading the same source we're
reading the same information like we were defining every single letter of the alphabet if you have to yeah and we're going to we're going to agree at the end and I'm going to find out that I'm wrong or they're going to find out that they're wrong and I just like I've got this like.
I wish you could like do that but because of so many people they just like you have conversations with them and I'm sure you get this with Muslims like they'll duck and weave you'll tell them something and they'll be like and they'll be like what about this and they'll just move to a different subject and then just move the goal post around like crazy and you
can we just talk about what we were talking about.
Yeah most definitely and for me it's like also what it becomes so apparent because like for me it's so easy like when you do you know you go for the low hanging fruit in Islam especially like if it's out of the Quran because you know no matter what sect or I like to call it like species or breed of Islam you follow.
What you have to the fundamental claim is that the Quran is like legit the word of God so you can you can like dance and dilly dally around the hadiths and whatever till the cows come home but the second you say well Quran 434 let's have a chat they're like.
Oh my goodness no I just let's not have this conversation that they're like each to each religion everyone is their own and they literally you see the panic tactics that ensuing because if they confront the very fact that there's something in there that might be.
You know it just morally reprehensible but also uncomfortable for you as an individual living in 2022 with your mind and the way you treat your own family and your views and your morals and your politics and everything for you to think that your Allah could have screwed up that badly that so like I honestly just back to what you're saying as well sometimes.
When a video comes out of mine and it's doing really well like even my video my one of my first ones about feminism and Islam just completely that's an oxymoron my mom was so she obviously like she's she's just a beautiful like individual she just obviously wants the best of her child right she was so excited like for me and I was like mom actually like please don't watch it because I was scared like I know how much her faith means to her and whatever cotton candy version of Islam that she has it really helps her through life.
And I was like I don't want you to see those hadiths on the screen that would make you be sick because in Islam it is honestly it will make you sick it's not easy reading any of that.
Yeah I bet I actually like so I will do the same thing with people if a Christian comes to me and they say I really don't want to give up my faith I don't want to be challenged.
Great like but I said like go check out this person like I always talk about inspiring philosophy he's coming on again like I think he's I think he's he's not perfect.
I think he's wrong in so many things but I think he's as honest as you can be as an apologist so I point people to his direction all the time like hey look if you want to keep your faith like great whatever I'm not going to like I'm just but like this is what it's like we can have a conversation if you really have a conversation because because people's faith is so important to them and.
We're not ready to have that conversation you just push them further into cooking distance and then.
But I'm tempted let's do it let's have a discussion.
No I mean no I mean I'm sorry I was changing subjects I'm tempted to have a discussion on Quran 434 what is that I don't know what that is what versus that what does it say.
Yeah well let's have a conversation let's do it.
It's basically how Islam instructs you what Allah instructs you to deal with your wives when they're not completely obedient and listening to you so.
You basically need to like you know warn them and then you need to separate your bed from them like you're doing them such a favor honestly.
And then thirdly you need to beat them and that's it that's why I'm going to leave it at beat them because that is the original translation I don't care for apologizing lightly with a toothbrush.
Like a miswak like just a tap on the the rest like you know what translation what translation would you recommend.
Anyone that doesn't add anything after beat to be honest if you go to Quran dot com maybe try pick it whole or maybe even most in Khan.
I haven't I've been lacking my slacking in my Quran reading because obviously it's a it's shite.
Oh yeah yeah so I read it men are in charge this pick it whole men are in charge of women because Allah have made the one of them to excel the other and because they spend because they spend of their property for the sport of women sorry.
So good women are the obedient guardians in secret of which Allah have guarded as for those women whom fear rebellion admonish them and banish them to beds apart and scourge them.
Scourge usually says strike scourge yeah beat but the actual Arabic word is Daraba and Daraba translates to like beat and strike and the way that they would do it back in the day in those glorious days according to Islam.
The days before Islam were ignorant days but Islam has it all sussed out so what they would do is they would beat them similarly to how they would like tame that like chattel.
So they would get the branches of the day trees and that's the same thing I was saying about the policeman earlier you use a bit of it to like clean your teeth but you can also turn it into like a whip like thing.
So it's like almost like a whip but you're like they're hitting the horses and the camels with that as well but that's what they would use to beat their wives and then there's a prescription in Islam I think similar to Christianity as well like how to beat your slave but how to beat your slave a bit differently to how you beat your wife.
Yeah yeah there's a there's how to beat your Hebrew slaves and then there's different different instructions for non Hebrew slaves in the Bible yeah and Jesus didn't reform it Jesus didn't reform the slavery scriptures.
Okay so I've been having a lot of discussions with with Muslim Tik Tokers.
Oh you're brave.
They're everywhere on there and how's it going to help David you're right.
Oh it's it's it's fine I had one conversation that that actually was pretty good I think it went for like three and a half hours and by the end it was a respectful conversation like we disagreed and stuff but we're both respecting each other and the people and stuff and then there was another one.
Where the guy with some like he was so bad like there's a little clip of it on my YouTube channel but I go like can Allah's words be corrupted and he's like he's like no I'm like okay is the Bible is the Hebrew Bible from everything from Allah is like yes and like but and he's like so do they corrupt it.
Yes.
Yeah he fixed it okay but I know he fixed it but between when he did when it wasn't ever corrupted Allah's words can't be corrupted and like the dude was just like on a loop and like he was ducking and weaving but I wouldn't get off the point and that was an interesting conversation.
You've got him in a corner yeah because look he I see where he's coming from right because the Quran says that they have like corrupted their scriptures but yeah you've got because again.
That's what I mean like even with Islam the claim it makes like oh we're the perfected version of the Abrahamic faiths where you're getting basic entry level stuff wrong about their faiths in your very book so your Allah who supposedly created Judaism and Christianity and those two messiahs just weren't doing like a drop up to scratch that you had to do it all over again in Arabia and much worse can I say but um yeah it's so.
As a Muslim you can't deny that the Quran tells you their scriptures have been corrupted and they believe in this yari yari yari but then that that also came from God so somebody so there was some sign of community made a really funny joke the other day and he was like.
I was with one of my like white friends and there was a loud noise on the train and he was like I was like oh Jesus and my white friend turned around and this guy is obviously Muslim and of like Pakistani or Indian origin or whatever and he was like.
Oh my white friend turned around and said to me see in like a moment of like sheer panic.
Where's your Allah mom had gone mate you remember Jesus and he was like he was like well you would not want to hear a loud bang and then hear me shout Allah walk.
After that.
You get tackled by everyone.
Yeah exactly.
That's amazing that's amazing.
Oh sorry so the point was he was basically saying that for Islam and Muslims Jesus is like the vice captain of Islam.
We do consider him a messiah anyway so kind of it is already like a bit of a catch 22 because yes the scriptures have been corrupted as per Allah but also Jesus is one of your top profit so and also then you completely disagree with what actual followers of Jesus believe how he died versus what the Quran says.
Happened to him so that's another point of contention.
Yeah they they I've noticed that I've had a few conversations and watched a few I've noticed that what they do online in these tiktok like apologics Muslim apologetics things is they get people to concede that there must be that they probably is a creator that's the first they as soon as they've got them on that point that there has to be a creator then they they move them to like all these like arbitrary points that they.
Think point Islam which they do if you take all the take all their idea like you just believe or everything they're saying but like I just this one guys wouldn't I was like no I don't I can't.
I have no idea if there's a creator or not and then he's like well you have to he's like where do we come from I was like we came from probably the same place you believe your God came from.
Yeah well no God just God just always was like so why can't we say that about the universe like what I have no idea what happened before the Big Bang I don't even know before the Big Bang is a sensible statement like I don't want.
So give me some I need some ammunition give me some hard hitting besides around 434 what are some other hard hitting because the only thing I could think of was the moon splitting into yeah and then they just say miracle and you go okay like.
Oh yeah don't you know David everyone was asleep at that time okay they couldn't see it everyone was fast asleep I think I need our somebody said that but.
No let's yeah let's let's fill up your armor what what can we give you.
Okay I think they'll all say there are no scientific inaccuracies in the Quran also.
Are you kidding me?
The Quran says that like the like sperm comes from between the backbones and the ribs that's not true.
Yeah embryology is all over the place in the Quran so you can definitely deep dive into that and then again the creationist argument as well I think the Quran says that water like God's throne is basically on.
Like on top of the 7th heaven he's got a throne sitting on water and there's a whale that's basically holding the curvature of the like not the curvature sorry they thought was a flat earth.
A whale is holding the earth on its back.
I can't even say it to you like without increasing like what are you guys on King Solomon army of talking and slight David that I can send you a list of so much.
That's so that's so amazing it's so much like when because I've got.
Sorry David the sun bows the sun every day when it sets it goes under Allah's throne and it's such a good Muslim that about it prostrates under Allah's throne and then it asks Allah for permission to rise again and the day that it doesn't prostrate and ask for permission it will rise from the opposite side that's it we're all after me that's the day of judgment.
So so yeah it's so funny I remember trying to explain these things because I got a lot of friends that never grew up with religion and trying to explain like creationism or they're like wait but we came from monkey like no we evolved with them common economy ancestor with apes and stuff and then I'm like well no they believe that that's all a conspiracy and they're like what do you mean it's like well they believe that you know we have all this lineage back to 6000 years and they're like well isn't there isn't like civilization is older than that yeah but they all believe that.
They weren't really and it's like and then the book oh how do they you know we're at the fossil record oh they believe that cabin from Noah's flood all these animals every animal in the world and bug and insects and everything got on one big boat and floated around for a year and then.
Australians and come on you would at least know.
The aboriginal Australians have been here for like 40,000 years like we got paintings 21,000 years ago.
But no clue who Muhammad is or Jesus is.
And they didn't see the moon split in two or at least they didn't write it down.
They were asleep David.
But like and just trying to explain the story of Jesus like for a Christian perspective I'm like well I was like so God had to he gave us he was angry with us so he followed the world kid everyone and then he gave us a way to make him happy again which was to kill an animal and to let us throw him out.
And you know I don't know why to give them pain sensors and stuff and he kill on foot throat burn them and then God would love the smell and then he would.
You know eventually we kept sitting anyway so then God came down and sacrifice himself to himself to serve as a loophole for rules that he created that he can't circumvent and they're like right I'm like and he's coming back.
With trumpets and then everyone's going to be taken up to it's it's just like the more you think and there's a place of eternal punishment and a place of eternal pleasure and you're like this is so bizarre how do people buy into this.
I mean it's abusive David like literally what you're saying is literally like saying oh let me let me sacrifice myself to save my save you from what I would do to you anyway.
Which is honestly now that I'm fully up to scratch on what abusive I would say that is an abusive entity right there.
Yeah for sure there's sacrifice has to be a slave master relationship right sorry to cut you off but that's that's the dynamic.
It's always a slave master relationship at play there's this like this is completely subservient mentality that you've got to internalize to do that like in the slum we take it to the nth degree where we're like we bow before.
Not we sorry I want to completely distance myself from those people they they say things like we bow to nobody we bow our heads before nobody but the almighty but like you're still a slave to something like you're literally like the whole thing of like being a bit like Islam does not mean peace it literally means like to be sub like sub complete.
Submission yeah submission exactly.
Christians will say that Christianity is the only religion that God came down to us and loved us like flash yeah yeah and it's like but then it also says that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord it also says.
It also says that we are already a slave to sin and what's this that this that 1616 hundreds are poem that I really love by folk.
Anyway created sick commander to be sound and yeah it's just and that's in everything right that's in every religion.
Oh David that that for me when I was on my journey of trying to figure out truth and unravel Islam and unpack it and really I was having a serious conversation with myself because every single cell in my body at that time wanted to stay Muslim right because that's that is literally like I mean I don't nothing else what is life it's all meaning like that existential crisis ensues if this is not the truth.
But like yeah what what you're saying it resonates so deeply because you when you when you're in that state of mind you are.
You're not able to like follow where evidence actually leads you because you want to it's comfortable you're trying to look for confirmation bias.
Right the entire time you're trying to like I went went in delving into these sources being like let me see the words when my God protects me like let me.
I literally thought this is a manifestation of a beautiful perfect religion that men in positions of power are just on a power trip and they're misogynistic and they're screwed up but that's them and all those arguments you can buy into this like culture not religion blah blah blah I would have taken all of those covers to protect myself and not face the truth but when it was actually staring me in the eye I'm like no no no this God sounds like one of those police officers.
It really sounds like they we could interchange them and it's like hold on a second but when I listened to Christopher Hitchens.
Yeah yeah I think I listen to like the four horsemen and then I listen to Hitchens in his debates because I just think he the way he mastered the English language is like I mean it's mellifluous to my ears I can listen to that man speak all day long I don't know what that word is and that is that is beautiful.
Right.
Yeah it's so oh my goodness it's like an egasm oh wow and he's also dropping such knowledge and truth bombs at the same time that I'm like do I do I listen to your amazing articulation of that the syntax of that sentence or do I think how you're saying but exactly when he said sorry commanded sick sorry born sick and commanded to be well that I was like that was a massive moment for me like that.
And I was like hold on a second what kind of twisted it I was like not even an individual twisted entity twisted anything does that like makes you created and that's what I was just like that's when Christianity automatically went out the window for me because I was like whoa my original sin is just messed up and like at least in like Islam or like in Muslim cultures that I've grown up in it's very much like you're not.
You're not culpable for your ancestor sins or like the sins of your previous generations your forefathers or whatever which I think is quite healthy of a concept to acknowledge whereas when I like Christianity was like oh my days like the guys died for me to be good like bloody hell why am I not being good yeah exactly.
He's he's really good he's the only person I've ever and I'm still I hate and you know I hate homophobia and stuff obviously I've got a lot of gay friends but it's the only time I've ever been somewhat accepted accepted of someone using the epsilon like because he settled in a debate with some Catholics and he used it to point out how disgusting the Catholic.
The Christian ideas which is like I'm not going to say but he says like he says like you know you guys condemn my friend Stephen Fry your child made an image of God no you're not you're an epsilon and the way that just the fact that he used that word in a debate in front of like a huge audience and like he did it without even stuttering it like brain.
It's like it was a horrible word to say but it's like it bring to select the seriousness like no this is a really big problem like he didn't tap tap dance around it and I really took it to a whole other level David he was like I think he said at one point like I would rather Stephen babysit my children and then anyone of the clergy man like I would be on the like I'd be like 999 immediately.
I just have to read this out and I haven't I haven't been reading the comments because I want to stay connected in this conversation but every time digital Hammurabi post I have to have to read it out.
He said how do you as an atheist ground your ultimate.
Ultimacy of instantiation for the necessary pre-concept conditions of possible impossibilities providing for ultimacy such a joke.
So he's just being a he's just being funny or she's just being funny it's either Megan Lewis or Dr Josh their friends of mine that I love them so much he's pretending to be Darth Dawkins have you heard of Darth Dawkins.
No I haven't actually.
He's just the he's just the cringiest like he just he does these like debate bro tactics and debates some debates atheists online.
He just says he just says a bunch of gibberish like that.
Yeah, I love that.
Can you tell me about I haven't been bold enough to ask a Muslim about this yet but have you can you tell me tell me about Aisha Aisha.
Yeah, I can tell you that she was like given absolutely no choice and there's no such thing as informed consent when she was a six year old girl playing with her dolls and she was married off to Muhammad who was 52 or 53 at the time.
And then it's actually written that word for word in our scriptures that he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old.
And there's like various I mean I'm telling you not Islam is not an easy read.
It's not easy to digest as a woman reading it.
We talking about this every Sunday when I bring up these are these it honestly like it makes me feel sick inside.
This is codified child marriage and you see it play out in the darkest most like horrific scenarios in the modern context still to this day.
The reason I talk about Islam and the reason I'm willing to laugh about it and honestly like just just show it for what it is and actually say this is this is a joke in the modern day and ages because.
We see men in Afghanistan who are selling their six year old daughters to be married off to men who are old enough to be their grand, their grandfathers, and they have no choice but to do this but this is culturally accepted.
This is actually like a norm in these places but I mean you can say that this is culture and whatever you can harp on about that till the cows come home.
But the fact is Islam actually codified this.
If you take Islam at face value if you are at least in the mainstream fold of Islam like I was as a Sunni believing Muslim.
I think that the you are supposed to believe that the prophet is the most timeless eternal infallible most beautiful perfected human example to follow.
Men must emulate him women must revere him in every form and I'm sorry I just because of that people are willing to give away their daughters to men who are literally like 60 70 years old.
They are selling their daughters for a price to these men and you can't you cannot cut the cord if this was cultural.
I would again intellectual honesty I would say that but the fact that Muhammad himself who is a timeless example of humanity and he's done this we cannot dance around it I'm sorry.
So so if I was a Muslim according to the Quran would I be okay in selling off or giving away my daughter my six year old daughter to someone who's 60 70 years old.
Oh yeah most definitely David.
I'm not sure if you're aware of Muslim Dawah boys in the YouTube scene but Ali Dawah for example he has categorically said when he was challenged on this very point.
He categorically said if my daughter is nine years old and whatever she's reached maturity I will I would marry her off.
So I mean that's how damaging this ideology is but also just I always talk about like the damning effects of this but to me reading Aisha.
Like again we go back to the telephone game of the Hadiths but think reports that have come out of Aisha.
Reading that as a woman in 2022.
Reading between certain what like lines that Aisha saying or certain instances where for example the Quran was supposed to have a very very very.
Oh my goodness I'm so grateful this verse did not make it into the ground but it's basically a verse for breastfeeding adults so men and women can't be.
In the same room if they're not married or you know you're basically you could be married so you have to cover blah blah blah.
So the way to get past that was that you would suckle on the woman's breast 10 times and then it's all good.
So Aisha conveniently said that oh that verse of the Quran when I was sleeping I had it under my pillow but a tame sheep came into my room and ate it.
And I was like you go girl yes you saved us all so much bullshit.
And another thing she said when Mohammed is obviously coming to her she she's literally like Mohammed's personal life is just so scandalous.
So one of the times when she obviously catches him being really shady and wanting to just sleep with multiple women including his slave women.
She literally says oh I fear that your Lord hastens to fulfill your desires and like she says things that are very much like landing Mohammed in it like she was a lot.
She was ahead of her time in terms of the things that she's left behind so I say if you are leaning towards like even a little bit of feminism in this day and age if you read Aisha and you like try and connect with her woman to woman you're like I see what you're on to there and again all down from Mohammed.
Is there a book that you recommend or anything you recommend reading if someone wanted to read Aisha.
Again straight from the sources I'd recommend you go to sunnah.com and you type Aisha into the search tool and you read the hadiths that have been narrated directly sorry recorded and reported to have been narrated directly from her but it's very telling.
I mean she talks about how the women used to stay together there's an instance of domestic violence there you see how Mohammed handles it.
He literally like I mean it gets very problematic but Aisha I would say for 1400 years ago the woman she was a girl at the time was more feministic than most Muslim women are today ironically.
Wow.
Okay so.
How say there's someone who is like.
Wanting to leave Islam or wanting to question there or not question the base but because that's probably that's even harm them to.
Someone who's listening to this who maybe a Muslim who.
Doesn't like what they're hearing but they've lasted this long what would you what advice would you give to that person that man that lady.
Wait so sorry do you mean so so they they know they they know that things are problematic but they they don't want to confront it is that where they're at like well let's let's let's let's yeah let's say someone's watching now who's a Muslim who.
Yeah.
Doesn't really like the just just just walks away from the cognitive dissonance anytime these issues come up and they don't know what to do because their faith is so important to them and it's their identity.
That you know people will start asking questions if they just started not wearing a hijab you know things like that or or if the you know if they're a man if they started drinking or something.
What would you say what advice would you give to someone who's questioning like that.
See that's that's a tricky one because that's actually what most people around me this is a big exact phase that they're in and my only.
Like thing was to just carry on being myself and saying things that I would normally say while respecting their boundaries not shoving anything down their throat right because that's not that's not my intention at all like I'm not here to tell you what to believe at all I'm just saying this is what I found out and hey it seems like it's a it's a recurring problem.
So there must be something like you know theologically linked to it but what I would say is.
I think it's a it's a slow gradual burn and what you will do is that like you'll keep coming across or you'll keep having thoughts where it just doesn't sit right to you you really have to confront your fundamental beliefs and again going right back to the reason of my channel.
A lot of people are happy to just not do that and I understand I get it I get that your religion and your version of Islam is really peaceful and honestly really cozy and cuddly like I if your Allah is really the Allah in charge.
I am so down for that heaven and I'm so down for that Allah but the thing is it's not and that's not through any fault of your own it's just you don't know how dark and violent and morbid and homophobic and.
Racist these the actual scripture is.
So it makes makes sense that you don't want to confront that because as we were talked about earlier we touched on I mean everything ensues then you've got existential crisis you're like where's my morality come from like you're reassessing everything you've ever ever known like as an I say that the moment I realized Islam was not true for me.
It felt like somebody had pulled the rug from under my feet and I was just falling like that scene in Alice in Wonderland when she's like falling down the rabbit hole.
I was just like falling into this abyss of okay first and there's so many layers to that it's like wow I might have trust issues now because people I looked up to was actual figures of authority i.e. my grand teacher and my parents and my grandparents everything they might have taught me is completely lie and false.
But I've learned that by myself and then hold on you have a whole nother like set of questions and you're like am I crazy because am I the only one who thinks about Islam like this they all love it they're all happy in it what's wrong with me.
And then you go and thank thankfully there was the Internet and I found Twitter and I went on you and I was like whoa there's other people who also agree with me like I'm not crazy so there's that whole element but yeah there's there's so many layers to it because obviously if this is something really near and dear to you don't want to confront it and that's why I think one of the bravest things.
A human being can do is to be intellectually honest with themselves because like I mean like look at the flip side even if you want to throw like Chuck Pascal's wager in there or whatever the flip side maybe like.
Is it really like honestly David I don't know about you but like mental emancipation for me and you talk about home like homophobia as well like area like the fact that I had to like.
I was such good friends with people who identified as literally being gay and I would have the best time with them but I would lie in my bed at night and think are they going to burn in hell because Allah does not accept them.
So like what's going on here because he's so nice or she's so nice like what's wrong with me but like I want to save them and like there's some weird superiority complex there as well like oh I'm born normal quote unquote like I'm born okay.
I'm born under the remit of God that would get me to heaven like that's one point that I don't have to contend with is my sexuality like that's just again that's pure luck.
What if I was born a Hindu in Goa or I don't know like yeah what was I was born to like.
I think this is where the idea though it comes from like you can catch the gaze you know I mean you don't you're not born gay you catch the gaze from.
And that's why they have correction therapy and all that bullshit.
Oh my goodness.
I was mentioning before that my wife and I having our first child through IVF were super stoked.
Congratulations.
Let's drink to that.
I always have this joke that if they were if they were born straight I'd still love them.
So yeah I'm so on the other side I'm so on the other side where it's like I'm you know I want to support my biggest I've got a shirt that says ally like I'm like.
All there for my LGBT friends I in talking about being intellectually honest someone I think this was thought that you were saying that Aisha was in the Quran and they said no it's not true.
Not on the Quran.
Yeah please clarify your mistake.
I don't think it was a mistake.
You never mentioned it was in the Quran.
You explicitly said it was in the sunnah.com which is by definition on the Quran so mojo you know what I'm talking about hi mojo by the way you are regular nice to see you here.
Yeah no I definitely that's that's that's a schoolboy era I would not make sorry but also yeah no go ahead.
I want yeah I just wanted to make sure that we're we're being fair to Muslims and stuff as well yeah because we're being intellectually honest.
Yeah that's that's fine yes we wouldn't be otherwise.
I would definitely hold my hands up if I made a mistake but yeah thank you mojo for clarifying that.
Is there any is there this might be way to this may be an appropriate even ask but do you find that any anything in the in the Quran that you find as nice.
Now that you know the whole context like is anything that you go like that's good advice or like that's that's kind of sweet.
Well that's beautiful.
I'm really trying here David okay I'm really really really trying my best.
This is the intellectual honesty test this is like this really is.
I'm like even though the nice things that are coming to my mind I'm like that's still not like that good though like.
I'm like that's not like I'm trying to vouch for someone being like there's a good thing is somewhere.
I'm really trying oh my god.
Do you know what I don't know but he stopped like even like adoption and things like that like he made like the opposite of what you would expect and like I can talk about the charity part but that's one of the pillars that's different.
But I will say one of the mekansuras when he was more peaceful because he had no Mohammed had not as much of a following and he had to be tame and there's a line where he literally repeats it like ad nauseam it's not even like nice sounding.
He's like yeah to your religion is your like your religions for you and my religions for me.
Oh mate those are the words that should have like just stuck with you not like you are not a good Muslim until you've considered or thought about jihad like that should not take in that dark time.
You should have just stayed.
I just I just giggled beautiful Quran verses and there's one that says Allah does not burn the soul beyond that it can bear.
Thank you Allah how nice of you mate you'll just burn me just just to the point that I could take it thank you.
And he found you lost and guided you.
I mean there's some nice stuff in here.
Look I'm just trying to I'm just trying to hold on for for however long.
Yeah sure and you know and nice other stories to like embellish it but stories you learn are like so completely fake like there's this really really widely peddled story about this woman and it's completely false.
It doesn't exist anywhere in Islamic sources or scripture but it's a woman that used to basically hate Mohammed and she would like chuck like rubbish at him every day and one day she didn't chuck rubbish at him and then he actually was like oh I didn't get rubbish chucked at me today.
Let me check on this woman and he went and checked on this elderly woman that exists nowhere but you're told this and you're told like that's the kind of man that you're you're dealing with here.
And also his sweat smelt like roses David and yeah you know he's just so gross to think that you would smell someone's sweat.
Oh my goodness they would apparently like dip their hands and stuff into like some of the bowls he had washed his hands in or like things.
Yeah that's very like culty and weird with like the reference towards Mohammed's bodily fluids and like yeah.
There's in Christianity there's that verse where the woman caught in adultery is about to be stoned to death and Jesus comes and says let he use without sin cast the first stone and everyone always puts it in every Jesus movie it's the most beautiful thing.
It's not in the earliest manuscripts.
Really?
Yeah that's a later thing.
Oh wow.
Yeah so it's like it's not in the earliest manuscripts and that's like darn.
I did not know that and so and is that like a recurring thing or is that just like mentioned in one gospel or like where is that?
I don't know I don't know and I'm only quoting Professor Bartier Herman on that so I haven't like fact checked it myself but he's like a textual critic so like you'd know if he was making it up but it's not in the early sources doesn't mean it's not original canon or anything it could still be what actually happened but it's just not in the original sources.
How interesting.
I've got a couple of, oh actually before we do that can you tell the gruesome story about someone snapping legs between two camels or something?
Oh my goodness.
Oh is that too dark?
Is that too dark?
Yeah I mean it's Islam so.
But yeah I think I mean I haven't brushed up on this recently because there was a couple of incidents which are some of the most horrific and this is one of them but if I'm not mistaken she was again she's a rebellious woman in terms of like prophet's message and stuff.
I think she was maybe one of the poets because he killed a lot of poets initially also that very much corresponds to like the way the Quran was written because the entire form of like poetry and this like oral transmission was so widespread in Arabia at this time because they weren't really lettered they weren't really writing as much down as they were passing down stories and oral traditions.
So a lot of these like poets or women that would already write really skilled and then they would speak out against Muhammad but probably be doing so in a way that is almost challenging the malifluousness quote unquote of the Quran and how that is like read out.
So Muhammad obviously in all of his wisdom and beautiful timeless example for mankind ordered her death and she was basically tied like one leg was tied to a camel and the other leg was tied to a camel and they forced those camels to like go on either side.
So this woman was essentially split into by these camels on Muhammad's orders and I David I swear I was going to say I'm sorry to God but I swear on fricking science and rationality.
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
I literally could not believe my eyes when I read that story.
I was flipping through books and I was like Muhammad did not Muhammad did not know that Muhammad did not someone's someone's mess this up somewhere.
Yeah, madness.
That's crazy.
That's that's that's crazy.
Of course that was a different time.
Things have changed that you know like he was God was only working I was only working within the time.
I want to jump into some Q&A so if anyone's got some questions I'll start typing them and start asking them now.
I haven't been checked the chat too much so I hope no one's been bigoted or anything in here because I haven't been watching.
It all seems squeaky clean and a couple of my regulars are in the house.
John stopman's actually saying time for beer and Berg Dutch booze and cola Bottoms up bottoms up.
John bottoms up awesome awesome so just before we do as everyone's getting some questions if I have any questions.

next week we have by the paranormal is BS with skeptic which is going to be a fun one and then we have the long awaited sequel to Michael Jones coming on which is the problem of evil a Christian philosopher and I discuss it and I'm going to bring out all the stops for that one because the first time he was on I was as polite as possible but now come pretty friendly we send each other memes and stuff so I'm going to like take the kid gloves off and I'm going to go go hard and it'll be an interesting conversation I told him that
I told him that he said oh I want you guys I'm a bit nervous about discussing the problem of evil because it's quite emotional I said I just want I just want you to come on and and for me to yell at you about children with cancer for three hours
How dare you how dare you
oh my gosh
well no also I just want to say you're doing amazing stuff and we talked about a bit about this off air as well but like again I would love to absolutely love to return this favor are you all more than welcome on my channel I would love to introduce you to my some of my audience here I'd love to introduce you to the entirety of my audience and get your story and I feel like we've got a good thing with the back and forth I think you know between Christian week if we can like
if we can fire shot the Christianity in Islam in a one and a half hour conversation I think we're winning in life
I love I'll be it'll be an absolute honor to come on to your channel and yeah it's been a really I mean I apologize everyone it's 5am for me I'm really tired but I feel like I feel like our back and forth is really good but usually I'm a bit more upbeat than this but I'm not going to be here
oh so I think we'll get the real David today
no you got a little bit you got a little bit you got you got probably a more reserved one I probably would have interrupted more which is annoying like annoying for everyone else so it's probably better than I'm tired
okay no but let's definitely do this again a much better time for you I promise it won't be some ungodly hour
no no it's fine I don't mind this is better than like 10am on a Saturday because otherwise I just like the day's wiped because like now I can go to sleep but anyway we're not we're not ending it yet we're still got questions okay
okay
I'm just worried about you by the way David so whenever we need to
no no no don't don't we gotta go okay
no that's cool we got some questions so tell
Binnenberg really I thought I was really anglicizing it but thank you John I'll take that
um so um this is the I've got three questions one of them a tool for my ask every guest this is the first question I don't ask every guest but I've kind of asked it already but maybe you can just give like a punchy answers this but what advice would you give to someone who is in Islam and wants to evaluate the things that you have mentioned
I would honestly say do it do it and please don't rely on
like authority because that that's a that's a huge thing in Islam where one major reason where your questions or your critical thinking is curtailed is because they just delegate the authority they delegate your thinking and they ask you to delegate your thinking to an Imam or a scholar or somebody who genuinely is just the embodiment of those topics
so you need to like actually ask yourself if if what that Imam or what this person is telling me is it good enough is it a good enough response am I actually intellectually morally emotionally satisfied
if you're not which I can guarantee you will most likely be the case because their answers are so bad
um you should just honestly follow follow your gut and I promise you on the other side I am still
nooria I'm still Pakistani I'm still British I'm still everything I ever was it's just my mind is free I can I can wholeheartedly love
my friends who are homosexual or whichever like I don't need to like lie to myself and harbour this weird feeling of like wanting to love them but knowing that like eternally I can't because they're wrong in God's eyes like
these weird battles trying to justify why Muhammad married a child trying to justify getting women and raping them as captives of war as part of your war booty
it's so much easier than to be on this side and call it all out it's harder to be a Muslim and defend that so please trust your gut if you're finding it hard to defend this
maybe it is because you're a better person than what Islam mandates you to be and you need to follow that line of thinking and intuition because it's really something be intellectually honest is what I'd say
be intellectually honest that's great um this is another question that just popped into my mind that I forgot to ask before but how did you deal with the the and take as long as you want how how how did you deal with the emotions of leaving Islam like
like how do you deal with the emotional because there's the intellectual side but then there's like okay now I'm not a Muslim like how did you process that did you have to relearn things like
oh fully and like ironically it's like in Islam when you go to do like Hajj or Umrah which is like the mini Hajj which is the pilgrimage and you touch the garba and they say like oh you touch the black stone and you do that and you're essentially like a newborn baby or your
um as I said like leave the the like I think I was like hardcore into this research and I was maybe in the middle of one of mass Arabs YouTube videos because it was him and Sharif Gabba who I like finally went to when I searched is Islam the truth on to YouTube like something as basic as that has like honestly changed my life
but having having done that like seeing I think there was one point in mass Arabs video because I was binge watching this I was like I want to know and I was cross referencing every reference he gave I would check it like there is no tomorrow to make sure he was not misleading me like because I'm telling you my prerogative was to stay in the religion so I wanted him to be like saying something out of context
and like no and behold no it was word for word what he said it was on that page on that chapter exactly but yeah so yeah I when I I left Islam I was in the middle of watching one of those videos it just dawned on me there was an Allah and Muhammad like sign in my grandma's house in front of me and I just looked at that thinking oh my word like this will never ever ever be this
same or mean the same to me like ever again like in fact my mind was going crazy I was like seeing the Allah like the Arabic writing I was like that's like a serpent that's like mad mythology in this is like the Babylonian origins like I was going wild because I learned so much information
but like yeah like I didn't know who I was I literally like I remember sitting in my room and I was like whoa okay this means that everything that I think is morally right right now is not my own thoughts those were given to me so I was like oh my gosh Nuriya you need to come up with your entire own morality like where your boundaries where where where the things crossed the line for you like what do you agree with and slowly like
that's the moment of existential crisis but then like the more I got comfortable in that position I was like hold on I'm just like being the person I was even when I was a Muslim but now I'm not changing myself to mend into those ways like I'm just like I love those gay friends of mine now I could just love them
I'm not dealing with that thing so like this was always me I was always trying to bend to Islam Islam was not bending towards me so getting rid of it I was like oh my god I can manifest my authentic self which is just somebody who loves humanity I don't give a crap like I literally couldn't give
like a toss where you're from or what religion and that was always me that's my prerogative that's how my parents have raised me that's what my experiences and my schooling and my friends and even now that's why like I do think I'm very privileged like as an ex-Muslim activist I've not lost friends over this cause you know like they are very in fact they're Muslim and they'll say yeah yeah we're culturally Muslim but like they're like also really like know the bad things and they're like you know what you do you'd like do what you got to do they celebrate me they celebrate my 13k
they're not even in this but yeah it's just I feel like I'm very privileged in that sense for sure but I'd say be intellectually honest with yourself and I promise you the other side of not having to defend these messed up things is so much easier you sleep so much easier at night it makes so much sense why you don't have this weird purity culture and misogyny and divorce laws and having to sleep with another man before you can go back to your husband
like these things are more complicated than just living true to who you really are
yeah wow wow wow wow
that's probably the wine talking now David sorry
no we can keep going for ages but
another question is probably mind are there any countries you can't go to now now that you're an apostate
yeah all of the I think it's 12 or 13 at the minute that still have the punishment for apostasy which is death I can't go I wouldn't go to any of that I can't go I can't I can never visit the UAE anymore I'll never go back to Saudi Arabia where I grew up I will never go back to Pakistan in my lifetime which is sad unless something major happens there and maybe one day if I have kids I can show them it but I have no hope that that or like no no optimism that that's
actually going to be a reality it's all gone Europe and America is where I'm going to holiday David so yeah and if you ever come to Australia I will take my wife and I will take you around everywhere show you around like if you ever make it to Australia
oh thank you definitely yeah that would be amazing cheers
it is and right back at you when you're on this side of the world
well careful I'll take you up on that and we'll go
London's always a good idea oh the pub culture here you would love it I've been I've been to London in Scotland and I and most of Europe and I loved it so much
amazing so different culture with the bars our bars are kind of gross compared to your bars like your pubs and stuff yeah okay the last two serious questions what if anything would change your mind
for Islam
oh my goodness oh my goodness
let's let's let's I'll rephrase it will change your mind on the
the truth of Islam so not not necessarily the you might still find it immoral but you would consider it true
that is so tough it would have to be honestly frickin miraculous and like out of this world it would it would literally have to be something like I don't know Gabriel actually coming down to me and being like yo woman
you're seriously misguided bro like do you want to get there and I
this is like me not on any any hallucinogenic this is not me in in abbreviated or I think this is like a pure conscious experience but other no I don't think in fact I I have it like I genuinely think about
I wish I wish I could get five minutes alone and just speak to Mohammed and be like what is wrong with you like that would actually be more of a
yeah I don't know but that seems more enticing Islam for Islam to be true maybe I'd have to like have a concussion and and
I know what you mean it's like even even though like if I'm the same like if I started seeing some crazy stuff I don't know even then if I would trust my senses unless someone else could also verify
verify what they're experiencing or seeing at the same time and it was consistent over like because I know there's also mass hysteria because it becomes a really tough question to kind of ask yourself as well
it's a tough question
yeah and I'm not to prolong this conversation but like just to give a quick quick thing even when I was Muslim for example and I was going through very tough times
no you need to prolong as much as you want I'm not ready for bed I'm totally cool
oh okay okay thank you I just wanted to touch on this
no yeah go
it's really interesting you asked that when I was a Muslim and I was going through a tough time personally emotionally I actually had the most vivid dream where I actually saw the prophet Mohammed
and as in like he he was like completely I saw him in the way that I had been envisioned to see him so he in Islam you don't really can't even put a face to him because he's that like exemplar right
you can't give him a normal human attribute and I say now that I'm ex Muslim it's because him and Allah are interchangeable they are literally they are they are quated okay he's basically God
and we do worship and revere him so that's another thing Muslims need to like deal with but I actually had a dream like a full on dream where I woke up genuinely feeling like oh my God my heart is not heavy anymore
like I've been cleansed like he took time out like I genuinely like was wrapped up in this belief that the sighting of prophet Mohammed in my dream on the night of power in Islam it's called is the night that the Quran was revealed to Mohammed and it's a considered a really sacred night and then Saudi Arabia and Dubai
you get that night off so that's the night where people read Quran more they pray more and like all your sins are forgiven body blah
but like in that sense of hysteria you really can manifest this crap and like your unconscious mind can lead you to believe you genuinely have had a one on one experience with somebody and as a result like your heart is lighter or that trauma is not traumatic for you anymore we've learned to deal with it
so that's really so I just want to touch that so you are you saying that if I told a Christian or a Christian friend of mine that you had a dream that an Allah appeared to you in a dream or Muhammad Muhammad appeared to you in a dream
and after it you felt your heart being lighter and you felt they would not believe it they would say no that doesn't I don't agree with that I've literally told Christians this before and they go they go well I don't I don't subscribe that
because they believe that that money comes from God like from the non Allah God like comes from Christian God so that this is something I wanted to ask you about did you ever have any spiritual well that's a spiritual spiritual spiritual experience but did you ever have any other experiences or can you go into more detail about that experience or or anything like that
yeah so I mean because what as I said like when I was a believing Muslim I no matter what I did or because I was growing up in such an international environment with so like so much international exposure
I did not have the time to be so conservative but my belief was so like it was so heavily that I think I was very spiritual as a person like I am very much like an empath by my like in terms of my personality and like I am
you know even today when I hear like a song even if it's about God or whatever it's the music and the whatever that resonates with me and I really I still love it like I genuinely do
so when I was a believer obviously I'd be even more into it because I genuinely believe that that all existed and so I had plenty of spiritual experiences which makes me realize that oh my God is this growth or
you know am I just way too stoic for my own good now like what is it because I used to have like I lived in Saudi Arabia so Mecca was 40 minutes away from us and obviously like being able to go to God's house which is Mecca and the Kaaba is there like being able to do that every other weekend when people spend their whole life savings to go and do that
that's a pillar of Islam and I was able to like put on my bio have my pajamas underneath and like do it like on a Thursday after school and then like I was like oh my God like I'm so blessed like God has chosen me and like my family to put him so close to him every one of those visits was a spiritual
experience every every time I had heard the call to prayer and I truly felt it inside whatever was going on my day like I just stopped and like I guess people would say it's like a kind of I don't know a meditative feeling at the time or whatever but I would totally be immersed in that and I'd be like this is the most comforting thing ever so every little
tenant of Islam was spiritual to me in whatever way because I was genuinely drawn to that and now I'm just like oh my God I'm just I'm so rational that it's like yeah there's nothing that's why that's why you got divorced and that's why you made a YouTube channel yeah
and now we go to concerts and just let out that spiritual thing you know like the music let me feel the music drum and bass or whatever it is
my my when I interviewed I interviewed my wife Amy when we when and she you know about her journey out of religion as well because she wasn't she's not she doesn't really care as much as I care about like she just kind of like shrugs and chores because okay that's I don't believe anymore or whatever but she said that she gets the same
feelings that she used to get in church she said the exact same feelings you should choose to get in church she get in a musical seeing like wicked or
wow yeah yeah yeah so yeah so and I was like wow that's what I mean exactly that's beautiful right because I again this was part of my existential crisis where I was like well those things are not going to hold any meaning I have no spiritual connection in my life like I've got nothing that's like transcends the ordinary you know something you can really
but that's not true and I think we need to push back against the idea that religion has a monopoly on these feelings and these experiences because I'm sorry if you go to Amsterdam and you eat in a space cookie sorry space brownie or cookie whatever it may be and you've walked into you've gone into a club where the music is so up your street you're going to have what I can pretty much say is the closest thing to a spiritual experience you probably have
in a church or in a mosque or whatever like for me I'm all about that like that I have those experiences and it's wrong for religion to say only those can only religion can cause that neurological state of being in my mind because I know how to artificially manufacture that mate so don't worry
we've got this
didn't Richard Dawkins write a book on this because he was like he got so angry at like
maybe I have not read all of Dawkins I must confess but yeah I think he must have for sure
he's kind of in the naughty list at the moment for online
it's not books do you finish life but it's another one of his books
oh yes books furnished life is it that one
I've got that on my bookshelf actually
oh okay
oh jeez this is this is really great radio anyway
the magic of reality I don't know I don't know sorry I'm a little bit intoxicated but
last question sorry last serious question I got a fun question
what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in as an atheist
oh that's really good the most plausibly true well jokes that you're putting plausibility and like
well yeah like yeah yeah
I don't know enough about it but like I think something like along the lines of it's not even a religion maybe I don't know
but I would I would start with like maybe Taoism or just the philosophy of Confucianism would be
slightly more plausible to me than something as like dogmatic as any of the Abrahamic faith for example the creation story just
I'm like this is absolute child nonsense mate like a garden of Eden a talking snake
of course you can make this in that's why women have childbirth get out of here get out of here like this and then incest was like
the tool to populate the earth and then God still got sick of it and then no one's family was like
what's going on here this is a joke like yeah but yeah I think I think some of the more subtle religious philosophies
which might not be as obviously organized as the religion are a little bit more appealing just because I think they require
a bit more intellectual groundwork as opposed to having all your thinking already done for you
so I just appreciate that more and I feel like concepts like I don't know Buddhism again I'm not vouching for
and I don't agree with it at all but there are some elements which did take my fancy at some points because even in Islam
I'd always dabble I thought even Sunni Islam was too rigid for me I'm a very chilled out person I really am like I'm
very much like live and let live and I expect people to like respect me being able to do that as well
whereas Islam is like how many stones did you wipe your bum with today and like you know very like it's so rigid
like you're like what is this God on like chill out smoke a jay God relax like you really need to just calm down pipe down
smoke a jay God relax that should be the quote of the stream
relax yourself yeah I know I know why is it angry like things that don't seem honestly Allah if you could invite Allah to your
deep drinks podcast David I think you might you might Allah might become next Muslim by the end of trying to you
what would he drink what would he drink though what would be his choice milk and honey because that's what
oh and wine that doesn't get you drunk is what's in Islamic heaven so don't those three things tickle your fancy David
doesn't really doesn't really sound like heaven
what's the point
I think they might say oh it might be alcoholic but it gives you no hangover so that how God is how great is God
oh yeah that's that's that's nice
paracetamol kind of works well
exactly
last this is kind of a bonus last question
but I could keep chatting raise we should do this again or I'll come on to your channel like we really great to see
I love that
if you could choose an afterlife right and it would become immediately true
which afterlife would you choose and this includes like
you know all the classic heaven and the hell ones of every religion includes reincarnation includes
all the Egyptian religion
their afterlife the the Norse religion afterlife where you know I think the Vikings were you know you would
you would all feast and then you'd have a battle until everyone's dead and then next morning you'd wake up
and do the same thing we have a huge feast with be on wine and then you kill each other again like every day over and over again
they would just battle and then and die and battle eat and die drink
for eternity like
they loved it yeah they just love the glory
we eat with peace and we kill
every day
well no I'm definitely I would pop in and join the Vikings on their feast for sure I'd absolutely love that
I definitely pop in
I don't like someone fact checking on that because I don't know if that's actually true I just heard that but yeah
sounds luscious and I think if I'm not mistaken that their hell is quite like frosty and just like endless
like just cold which is again this really helped me like get out of the mindset that hell was even like a real thing
because the Islamic one was so polar opposite and it's like desert and scorching heat and like being roasted and toasted alive
so I'm like well they've got a compulsion with heat and these lot have a mad fear of cold or make sense to graphically speaking
but yeah I think I definitely joined the Vikings at feast that I drink a couple of pints with them and they're very sick
what do you think with a skull they would say
skull to the Vikings
so yeah I live it up there I think I think the concept of reincarnation is quite appealing
because being stagnated and then the Islamic or like Christian heaven for eternity seems a bit depressing
Islamic heaven is like me I want to tap out like that's just it's it's like a see-through brothel with like the weirdest
like I don't want to be part of that like that's not even heaven to me that's like my definition of a warped hell
that some mad desert better when like hallucinatory like like you imagine an oasis and this is your like deepest darkest fantasy
come to life and it's just been there is Islamic heaven
but reincarnation sounds cool I've always been injured like that sounds cool right because you could you just like you get another go
and if you if if you're not reincarnated to be something terrible because you've done like bad karma or whatever like I don't want to be
so I always think like what would I want to be a bird would be so cool just because I want to experience the sensation of being able to fly
but then I would think my worst creature on earth right now like my my biggest phobia is like crocodiles
but I was like if I was to be reincarnated as a crocodile yeah but imagine if they could speak they've been around since like the dinosaurs
they were able to like turn their breathing inside out and just go under the water me if they could tell us about what earth was like back then
I'm like that's power knowledge is power they've got it but yeah so maybe maybe something like that
have you have you heard of bow greaves no actually haven't so he's I've actually met him
I drove him around but he's an Australian guy he's crazy you should never ever ever ever ever no one should ever do this
he like he risked his life way more than anything else but he loves crocodiles and so he goes swimming with them with saltwater crocs
oh my goodness we didn't even know this was possible
he's like is he braver than like Steve Irwin was with crocs
way way more brave it like he would Stephen would never get in that close to a croc a saltwater croc
oh my goodness it is it is unbelievable that he's not dead like he actually got fined a lot of money for picking up these crocs like 10 grand or something
oh my days okay and he's never been like her or injured by doing this
I think he's been hurt but I don't know if he's ever been like had his arm he's had his arm bitten off or anything like that
but yeah that's it's so so dangerous
yeah but yeah I and just quickly as we wrap up
I you mentioned hell before we have I did a hell cast panel where myself some PhDs in a seriology in Hebrew Bible Old Testament
and some other content creators did a hell cast on my main channel
so on my main channels you should become David McDonald YT and we did a kind of like a panel deconstructing hell
so yeah that was really good
yeah and we talked about hell's history we talked about like how to get over the fear talked about like what happens if you still got fear and other things so
if you're if you're you're struggling with that you can go check that out and then that might be able to help you
Noia
sorry David I'm sorry my only thing was when people ask me now like oh do you not fear hell like and how did you go over that
and I just say to them that it's really hard to fear something that's like doesn't exist
it is literally like a figment of someone's imagination so it's kind of hard to be scared of that when it's like nonexistent
but that's only because I'm at where I'm at now but yeah I completely get you and yeah as I said you're doing amazing stuff so
thank you so much I really appreciate it and it was great to see you popped up in the comments the other day
