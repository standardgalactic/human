Despite the outward conflicts and all the junk
that people throw at you and the challenges
you might have with a boss,
I mean, all those things are real.
But in here, in your heart, in your mind,
in your person, there's no gift you can give yourself,
like living authentically.
It's just, it is the most amazing thing
about leading superstition.
It's a gift that I feel like I get to give
to myself every single day.
I wouldn't trade it.
People ask, would you ever go back to religion?
I say, no.
No, I'm better now.
I'm more centered.
I'm not in conflict.
I don't live in shame.
I get to be curious.
I get to discover the world.
I get to learn new stuff all the time.
I mean, it's just, I feel more alive than I ever have.
