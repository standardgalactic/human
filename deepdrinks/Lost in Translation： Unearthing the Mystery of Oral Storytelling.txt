I just don't know how to tell. I just don't, I just don't know as a scholar how to tell you that I know this, this or that comes from storytelling. I don't know how to confirm for you, especially given even like, again, Luke's preface that tells me his, he tells me he's reading stuff.
Like, the texts tell us these guys are reading. And so I don't, I don't see a lot of evidence for oral, oral tradition, and even what we have.
