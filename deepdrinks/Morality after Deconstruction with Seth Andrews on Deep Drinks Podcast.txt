when you slough off the shackles of superstition,
and you find yourself back at square one
and you think, well, how much of how I feel about things
was informed by my faith?
And I had to go back point by point in terms of my values
and say, well, how do I feel about this?
And it ended up transforming so much.
I used to be a death penalty guy, you know, eye for an eye,
you know, code of Hammurabi, ironically,
and I went back and I actually began to research,
you know, how effective is it?
Is it a moral thing?
