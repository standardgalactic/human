It can make them potentially believe in themself.
It can make them believe in their community,
have strong feelings for their community.
It can also be used by the people
who are eliciting these experiences
to kind of use this whole group of people
like a spiritual army to do their bidding.
Like that's what Hillsong is for sure.
And so, you know, like getting people hyped up like this,
this is a technique, this is technology
that people have figured out
and people have known about for thousands,
if not hundreds of thousands of years, right?
And it's very difficult to get people to believe
that what's going on here
can be explained pretty well naturalistically.
We don't really need spiritual explanations for this
to make sense of it
because when you've had a really heightened experience,
you know, you saw angels,
you saw blood pouring from the cross.
Like, you don't want someone coming and telling you
that, oh, that was like chemicals in your brain.
No, man, I saw the cross.
