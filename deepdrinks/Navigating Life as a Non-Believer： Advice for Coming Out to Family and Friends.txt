What advice would you give to someone who is maybe,
has maybe crossed that line,
they now know that we can consider themselves
a Christian, a Muslim, a Hindu,
and they want to come out to their friends and family
as a non-believer?
Well, I think there's a cost benefit
that only the individual can navigate.
You have to determine what you are willing to endure.
And I think it's situational.
It's going to be different for everybody.
Someone may come out to a religious family member
and they kind of raise an eyebrow,
but it's not a big deal.
Somebody else may come out to a religious family member
and it means that they ignite the whirlwind
or ignite the wildfire.
I don't know, I got my metaphors confused.
Yeah, yeah.
And it's crazy, you know, things get awful.
