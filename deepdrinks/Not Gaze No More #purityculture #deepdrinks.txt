Do you believe that the Lord tonight has set you free?
Yes, sir.
Tell her.
I'm not gay no more.
I am delivered.
I don't like men no more.
I said I like women.
Women, women, women.
I said women.
I'm not gay.
I would not date a man.
I would not carry a purse.
I would not put on makeup.
I will.
I will.
Love.
A woman.
Somebody believe God with him.
Hey!
We don't just preach condemnation.
We preach reconciliation.
God bless you.
