I was living in the UAE. I was married Islamically, so by default women are not given the right to
divorce in Islam. Very quickly the marriage fell apart. It just, there was like a lot of abuse there.
When this police officer in the UAE called me up and said, we've got this order for Ta'az al-Gi on you,
and I was like, sorry, I have no idea what you're on about me. He basically said like,
you need to go back to your husband's house and return there, and you cannot leave without his
permission. If you don't go back by this time and date, we will arrest you and forcibly take you back.
They came to my house as well. They tried to catch me there and try to take me again in the
middle of the night. And when it got very, very serious, I had to call the emergency number for
British expats in Dubai because I was like, these people aren't ensuring my safety. To go to like
Islamic marriage counselling before you can get a divorce. And he would say things like, she's
possessed with like, there's like a gin inside me, a gin is like an Islamic demon. The counsellor
would say like, how many times a day do you pray? Were they court appointed marriage counsellors
that you had to go through? Yes, official ones, yes.
