Hello everybody, do you know how there's that old idea I guess like when humanity was still
trying to figure out like what happens to us when we die and we ended up this the Greeks and the
Romans had this idea kind of again get a little bit wrong that when you die you go to the underworld
and in the underworld you kind of like wander around a little bit and and eventually like you
start to contemplate your life and then eventually you get drawn to like the base the the kind of
end of the underworld and you kind of go there and you're like you know just wandering along
and when you get there you you're at the the river Lethe I think it's called and you can drink
from the river and it it it wipes your brain you become you forget everything that you have
and you become reincarnated and you come out of the depth of Sheol out of the depths of the grave
and become a new person. Well I have to say I have returned I have been sick I've been in the
underworld for the last two years uh two weeks sorry uh and I I still am not sure if I'm fully
back yet because I I swear I I saw like a vision of like Ben Shapiro and like some like rapper doing
like some song together and I was like this this can't be reality but I'm gonna go along as if it
is reality and we're gonna start deepening so welcome everyone I've been sick uh and uh but
it's uh we've got an awesome episode today today we're interviewing Mark Peralta who's a Christian
who's been was a Christian for over 30 years he served in ministry for about six years before
becoming a pastor an associate pastor of a megachurch in Texas uh he now runs the Apostate of Mind
podcast with his wife Apostate Anne and it's with great pleasure that I introduce Mark Peralta
to hear his story for the first time welcome Mark to Deep Drinks podcast
David it's great to be here man thank you for inviting me I'm so honored to be here
man I I have to be real with you I've seen you around I've seen you with photos photos of you
with with like Aaron Ra and I've seen you I've watched some of your content uh and I was like man
I like I liked you straight away like I liked I liked your the messages you were giving out in the vibe
but I I deliberately didn't want to learn anything about your deconstruction story because all I knew
was that you used to be a pastor and now you're not a pastor and so I want to I want to like come
into this fresh and uh and you chose an amazing drink to do that um do that so what are we drinking
today yeah I'm drinking from uh good old deep cannons deluxe 12 years I don't know if you've
seen the uh you know who Sofia Vergara is uh no he's a Colombian actress uh she was in modern
family at American sitcom she's playing a role as a mafia drug lord in Miami which is where I was
kind of raced and uh she's out him drinking this in one of the one of the episodes because it's
it's very much an emblematic drink like we're as Colombians so I thought that the idea to
feature that yeah well that's that's awesome it's actually really hard to get in Australia and
um it's uh so I couldn't actually get the exact same drink but because you're getting something I
guess kind of from your homeland I thought I would bring a Scotch and I'm not Scottish
but McDonald is a Scottish name with the largest clan of Highland Scotch so I'm drinking
I have whiskey as well but it's a Balveny double wood 12 12 year which I thought I'd get the same
aged year there we go there there it is so that's what I'm drinking today and um I'm very much
looking forward to this um it's it's so good for me for me it's 11 a.m and it's always good to drink
an 11 a.m on a uh on a Tuesday morning so uh my first question for you is like I'm just ready to
just dive in so tell us about what kind of Christian were you hey tell us about your upbringing
sure so I grew up in the Catholic church so I was raised as a Catholic you know I did my first
communion uh confirmation and you know my entire family was Catholic um and then when we moved to
America and I got away from it a little bit and ended up coming back to an evangelical church
so as a as a as a child as a kid I was Catholic you know went to Catholic school then as an adult
later became an evangelical Christian right so yeah so did you uh how old were you when you did you
say when you when you kind of moved to an evangelical kind of church yeah so I was attracted
as as early as when uh senior year in high school so uh okay friends of mine that were Christian
and then invited me over to certain youth events and that kind of thing so from then I think the
the the seed was planted um of like hey you know this seems like a better place you know
they have better music it's a little more lively it's not as monotonous you know the whole kneeling
and standing up and that kind of thing and um I like the fact that there was not like confession
so that was a plus and so I was attracted to it and then kind of I mean I dabbled in and out um
but then it was not until I would be I got married with apostate Ann who was a Christian at a time
when we met when we started taking it seriously uh we had uh friends and family that recommended
us that you know hey if you want your marriage to last you know you've got to seek God and that whole
the three the three twined uh core yeah that's right little triangle pyramid
and so that that just you know that made sense and so we wanted you know we wanted our our family
our kids you know our future kids to be raised in a Christian household and so as adults uh newly
you know what we got rebaptized out of a covenant church which was um a charismatic evangelical
church and did the whole public proclamation and then got really into serving at the church
and I eventually decided that you know I love the scriptures I always felt passionate for them
yeah but I felt like I wanted to learn more and I think maybe that was something that also attracted
me to the evangelical church I felt like they were taking their time to explain things and get
into theology and stuff like that where that was not really the case at the catholic church
um and so I went to bible college I'm like you know what I want to learn this and you know become
proficient I like what I'm hearing but I'm also hearing words in Greek and stuff like that that
I'm not familiar with I'm like I need to know what that means so I changed my um I had originally
set out to go to dental school because I wanted to be a dentist but I changed my degree got a
bible degree undergraduate degree bible studies and then I continued on to a theological seminary
went to Dallas theological seminary and did a master's in biblical studies as well
wow yeah it changed my life completely so okay so I want to I want to step back a little bit
so when uh you and Anne um I decided that you wanted to take uh your relationship or your
Christianity more seriously what did that look like because for I my wife and I I think we were
kind of the same in that I wanted to I wanted to uh I would have been terrified of getting divorced and
you know and just like terrified of like our marriage failing ever since before we were even
married and I would like when we got married I wanted to take our finances seriously I wanted
to take my beliefs seriously I wanted to really like think deeply about who we were as people
and like and I wanted to like I wanted to not fall into the trap of satan or into the trap of
anything that could ruin this beautiful thing that we had uh so could you tell us a little bit
about like why did you take want to take it more seriously when when you got married and what did
that look like yeah so I mean it just seemed like the real deal and I think that the evangelical
church today is very good at presenting value to their congregation because you know we got into
like youth groups and serving there and then you'd get attracted to serving in other areas of the
church and then they offer programs like financial peace and stuff like that that are like you're
getting Christian education on how to run your home finances so they have a lot of value for the
family in fact one of the things that I learned later as a pastor is that children is really
what they're marketing to in most mega churches it's the children's ministry that's where the
money goes that's because they know like families want uh they want to find a home where they can
get all these benefits and and just do the Christian life in the best way possible so that
seemed like the right choice for us you know yeah it's it's uh it's funny to say that because even
recently I've been thinking like oh it's it's a it's a bummer that an outlet say a one-year-old is
is not going to grow up with that that like tighten it uh I guess church community that I grew up with
or my wife grew up with and it's kind of like I wish there was like a secular or like some sort of a
thing that was that was uh because because it adds huge benefit right having these like communities
it's like it's actually really helpful of course the fear of hell and purity culture and all that
other stuff that is not good and a false worldview but oh yeah yeah so you think about morals and
you know raising you know stand up children uh but also benefits too like if you have young
children it's very appealing like lots of churches will do daycare programs you know where you feel
safe right as a as a young parent like you're gonna bring your your your toddler and you're
gonna leave it in the hands of another adult not as a Christian and so you start getting all
sort of caught up in this web of life and before you know it everyone around you is part of the
church you know so we did a lot of bible study small cell groups we led for years because you
know i i got really deep into like i i just loved uh i'm still very fascinated by christ
scripture so i would i'd be the guy to you know put together a study and like you know pass out
you know little handouts and you know and then we got coffee and we've got little snacks and you
know you're doing community and we had lots of friends that uh you know we eventually lost later
when we moved away from church but yeah it becomes life yeah and what kind of what kind of
christian were you and this was this is a big thing for me because um like i don't know if i was
i would say i was judgmental as a christian but for me like i was very serious about
like lukewarm christians and i i was always paranoid that i was going to become a lukewarm
christian i thought that the bible clearly said that you know you would take up your cross daily
and follow and you know follow jesus you would pray for the sick you would you know it was all
consuming and i'm getting the vibe that it was all consuming for you as well did you did you were
you in a part of a church that did like speaking in tongues uh did you do healing like to do laying
on the hand the healings or anything like that uh yeah so it was uh certainly around the speaking
in tongues was um sometimes you hear a pastor uh do that from stage and um i never felt like i had
the urge to speak in tongues so it wasn't really part of my experience in fact in my own personal
learning i um i accepted this perspective that you know the uh these charismatic gifts
or the spiritual gifts were something that was just meant for the apostles this is known as the
cessationist uh perspective on spiritual gifts in that it was meant for them you know and so uh no
wonder ended up going to the allosteological seminary because they're they're very big on this
cessationist perspective about that so can we like take a little tension on that and just
explore that a little bit because because i i have friends and family that are kind of going
down that route who have who have been previously been like miracles and speaking in tongues is all
all good um there's just one verse that i get confused about just just put on your christian
hat again really quickly and just like explain this to me um i think it's um uh is it the
jonin comma it's the um it's john i think it's in john where it says like uh you will drink poison
and uh is it but is it is it the one about the snakes you can handle snakes i think so it's
it's it's like the idea is like because i asked the Jehovah's Witness this once uh and i said
i looked in their bible and it says um it says in mark uh 16 uh 15 he said to them go into the
world and preach the gospel to all creation whoever believes in his baptiles will be saved but
whoever does not believe will be condemned and these signs will accompany those who believe
in my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes
with their hands and they will drink deadly poison and it will not hurt them at all
they will place their hands on the sick people and they will get well so i was like how i don't
know how that perspective tell me how does that have a perspective how do you explain that yeah
yeah so at seminary they quickly would shut that one down because i don't know if your bible
will tell you this but if you read between verses eight and nine there should be a little asterisk
that will say the earliest manuscripts blah blah blah so what that means is very likely that part
of the passage that ending um in fact the whole post resurrection encounter here in the in the
gospel of mark was is not part of the earliest or the oldest manuscripts available and so what's
what's believed among scholars is that it was actually added later so we should have no reason
to trust this is divine inspiration yeah unless they really seem like they're getting super powers
yeah yeah it truly does and even like the story of axe and you know the disciples and the apostles
yeah okay well i mean we could do a whole whole episode just on that but um going back to your
story um so you go through you go through bible college you go through seminary what do you start
to discover in well i don't even know do you start to discover problems when you go through
seminary bible college or is it only later that you say yeah for sure i mean it can go either way
you know i had friends that graduated from seminary and that they are pastors they're all in
have been for years and then there's been some that have left ministry um and so
so for me i started noticing things because you know they teach you greek and hebrew so all of
a sudden you can read you can interpret the scripture by checking this original language
thing you know and so in seminary they teach you how to handle it how to translate you learn about
syntax grammar you get a bunch of tools you know you bought i bought scripture software
where i can map out the syntax on any given verse and have access to a bunch of books and
you know i i bought so many commentaries because i'm like you know what i hate driving down to the
library and i've got young children at home so i've got to have tools you know so you get all
these tools so then if you start using them you notice that there are some issues and that not
everyone agrees with with your um your fellow your professors your evangelical profs yeah you're
learning this stuff from yeah do you know what's incredibly frustrating is i got a strong school
chord and so i was like this is it this is all you ever need oh you understand the but and then i
was like and then someone's like no no that's not you got to get the interlinear so i got the
interlinear right i spent all this money on the interlinear it's a hundred dollars or something
like yeah i got the interlinear and then someone and then dr kipp's like no i think it was dana
clonin was like uh dr dan he's like i think you need the software because if you really need to
like you you got to get software and i was like ah and then i was talking to kipp and kipp's dr kipp it
is like oh there's really no substitute from learning the languages yourself because you
need to know the context i'm like ah damn it like there's just no easy way to unlock this like you
have to really like get into the weeds you can't just look up a word and be like it says day so that
means it means day in like the seven-day creation account for example yeah i mean you say uh
strong's concordance but yeah when you start when you you know what a lexicon is uh i know the name
uh huh so it's just a fancy word for a dictionary but it's it's a dictionary for like the greek and
the hebra so there are these two well there's several but you know you you got to work with
at least these two major ones and so you could look up any word in the original language and then
see what the lexicon says what it means and then you learn that there are all these different
usages like there's never like this one straight uh answer like yeah this means that you know and
that's it there's like all this ambiguity and like there's all there are all these debates
as to which usage of what you know and so it just it becomes a game it's it's it's actually it's fun
you know to to discover things yeah at least for me it was you know entertained it's what
blows my mind even more what what blows my mind even more what up when i learned about this was
there's all these debates about their manuscripts right and like the greek
but jesus didn't speak in greek he spoke in aramaic and these were recorded by god knows who
no one like and they're anonymous authors 40 70 like 40 to 50 60 years after the fact
in a different language by people who probably never even met jesus and like it's like it's
it's so far removed uh i don't know if you can trust anything that's like word for word maybe
like broad strokes you know there's a guy named jesus he died he was resurrected people believe he
that he rose from the dead maybe but like i don't know if you can like take like a like section of
what jesus said and be like this is what he said in english like i just don't i don't know how that's
possible yeah no in seminary they taught us about this thing that it was an event uh known as the
the jesus seminar oh yeah you've heard of this when scholars sat around and they voted they would vote
verse by verse like what's the likelihood that jesus said that and so when it came down to when it
came down to it there was really not a whole lot left you know like the red letter bible that's not
you know that's not anyway um you know accurate you know yeah so yeah you do begin to learn of
different things like for me it started with um the you know the first five books of moses
i don't know if you've heard of the documentary hypotheses yeah so we will learn that in seminary
well tell us a little bit about the documentary hypothesis and why i've heard that it's completely
wrong from apologists and that moses wrote that with a ballpoint pen um yeah so that's not what
like mainstream academics say so it's actually the other way around it's it's very unlikely that
a there there was actually a historical moses and that b that he wrote these things so what it
really does seem like um and that's where the documentary hypothesis which it doesn't just
come from one person although um uh if you google search wellhausen documentary hypotheses
you'll find kind of like the main guy um and so you can learn from him that there were actually
different sources that can be accounted for you know all five books like even genesis is not coming
from one uh from one desk you know there's several voices present throughout the text that at some
point they became compiled together and now we get them you know genesis you know cover to cover
but you know was it easy did he write the book um i'm sorry for interrupting you um but did he
write the book uh the bible with sources revealed um i don't know i think
have it somewhere i have it somewhere it was a really expensive little book but
it's got all the like what you're saying it's got like um the different scrolls and different uh
like was it like j a like the bible with sources revealed it has like different uh scrolls that
we use and like you read the bible but it like highlights them like the red the red letters are
from um the specific scrolls and the green letters from these specific scrolls and then you can read
it and then it actually makes a lot more sense um apparently i haven't spent the time to actually
read it yeah that's that seems like a nice tool if it's the one that i'm thinking here that one's
from um richard freedman perhaps it's the same one uh yeah that sounds that sounds about right
there's one uh online source i think it's called digital penitouk as well that i oftentimes consult
for when we're doing a bible study but yeah that's exactly right you've got like uh several sources
that are like uh sort of web together and then so scholars are looking at uh differences in style
different vocabularies uh different perspectives you know it really does sound like it's a patchwork
you know and that's that's what they're arguing so you're like you're all right so there's no
it seems like didn't come from one source and seminaries teaching us that you know this is
divinely inspired you know that ultimately god is the source of all this and that this guy moses
was chosen and that the exodus was historical but you know when you look at our what archaeologists
are saying about what's in egypt and what it's not and um what modern day um scholars of like
ancient near east are saying such as uh kip davis joshua bow and joel bayden well he's more of a
heber bible scholar but they're like you know maybe there was not even a historical moses
and there's always evidence about that and so you're like wait keep going then you look at the
gospels you know and that's another world of issues there with the um you know the gospels and
there really are different stories yeah you know we all kind of grow up thinking that there's one
harmonious life of christ you know and that's that's in fact the name of the one of the one of the
first courses that they teach you in bible college is the life of christ because they want you to sort
of like uh know the bible with this sort of uh unified narrative you know where everything
synthesized together but in reality when you look at each gospel critically and um and it's it gets
a lot of fun like we've done where you know if you read the birth narratives in mafio and then you
write down everything that happens and then you do the same for luke these are different stories
um so what's going on here it's it's very it's very frustrating for me because
when you you you can bring these to an apologist and there is an answer for everything there is
an there is a way around it there there really is there's an there's a way around everything
maybe something's metaphorical maybe something was like uh not historical but deliberately
not historical like it could be anything like we're talking about people who literally believe
jesus is coming back when he told his disciples three times truly i tell you this generation
will not pass away until all these things happen i mean that it's uh there's just a way to to get
around everything and and where you can can you tell us where you where you're at at the moment
are you in uh in america like what state you're in yeah i'm in texas yeah so okay i'm in the
sunshine coast in australia and coins in about now and north of brisbane uh if i told you like i'm
gonna walk to your house right and i and i've told this analogy before but i'm gonna walk to
mark's house and then tomorrow i'll rock up and i'm like i walked here right and um and then you
know later in hundred years there's a religion of deep drinks like david actually walked all the way
to mark's house and then people like no i don't really think he could have walked because like
there's a whole ocean between australia and texas like it's impossible to walk that far and then
and then an apologist comes up and a deep drinks apologist says actually david was trying to teach
us about deep vein thrombosis and it's important to walk up and down the aisle on the plane you
see he was he he was actually teaching us science there's science in deep drinks and you know there's
a way there's a way to make that work but i don't it's just not honest it's just on like to me it's
just it's dishonest and it's uh it's motivated reasoning and it just doesn't work to me yeah
because essentially their job is to defend what's already been considered dogma that you cannot
question and and that's how you gotta live your life one of the things that i did is i learned
from other students in seminary i thought now i think about it is pretty awesome and just straight
illustrative of the mentality of uh an evangelical bible and is that um so i got this little bible
that was you know a little pocket uh small you know preachers bible and the seminary would pass
out these we believe uh little booklets which what it is is the is is their creedal statement you
know all the different articles of faith like what they believe about the scriptures the godhead
angels the dispensations about creation salvation like what essentially this is what my professors
had to sign he's saying yes i believe all this in order for them to maintain their you know get
a job there and maintain their job and so a good scholar that i was i would then keep this
little thing inside my little bible case why because i'm i'm gonna make sure that whatever
i'm interpreting from this that it it matches with the dogma of my institution and so that's you
know when you're doing it that way when that's how you're interpreting scripture well you're bound
to make some mistakes along the way you know i think you're muted
sorry i was coughing my lungs up a second ago so i'm muted but that seems like incredibly dishonest
to me like it seems like very i just don't know how someone can look at that and go yep
this seems like an honest thing to do is to to like make everyone like subscribe to these
tenants and you can't like people pick on the catholic church for this kind of stuff but then
evangelical churches and young earth creationist organizations do the same thing uh yeah i i i i
remember they had me take a test before i got admitted into into my program and it was a theology
like what you believe and there was a at the end of my degree i remember having to write a
research paper on my like a personal doctrinal statement is what yeah a doctrinal statement
and it's just like they're making sure that you're coming in with the right theology and you're
leaving with the right theology and did you did you leave with the right theology because you
mentioned that you started to to question some of the things like speaking in tongues and things like
that how did your effective shift over the course of your education so i don't think i had enough
time to to really process everything because like i got hired as a pastor like my uh the year i
graduated so similar to me i think yeah you hear all these things you're like yeah i was a youth
pastor but it's like you hear all these things and you're like i'll just put that on the shelf to
like dissect later because you don't have time because you're doing assignments and then you're
becoming a pastor and then like yeah yeah that's right yeah so i had all the all the right books
on the shelf that eventually helped me later come out of that you know deconstruct my own way but
uh it was a process you know so jumping right into ministry um i was there about a year and a half
or so didn't last long at all and so that i would say coupled with what i had already been thinking
about and kind of wondering about at that moment i wouldn't say that i was becoming a skeptic yet
but i was certainly thinking that hey perhaps perhaps this whole um um you know the scripture
is infallible idea is not all all right you know nonetheless we're gonna trust you know that god is
gonna lead us and he has a plan for for us oh it was not until like later though that i started
like fully deconstructing but um i don't know if i if you have uh if it's clear enough so far before
i start talking about ministry but i can talk about some of the things that occurred there that
yeah continue that snowball yeah yeah okay so as a pastor first of all it was um we were
we're all in you know like we were living in one side of the of the city of the metroplex
and we uprooted our family over to this other city uh so that we can be close to this church
so we completely like just moved away from like you know in-laws and other friends that were close
to us to be at this one church and we get poured ourselves into this community
and um i was hired as an associate pastor where the the senior pastor was a fellow
student with me at seminary so we knew each other in seminary and he was already part of this ministry
that was a hispanic ministry within a anglo english-speaking megachurch and so they hired me as
an associate pastor and i start working in ministry coming to find out uh i'm i'm over here like
not necessarily doing theology or writing sermons or writing books but just more like
operations i'm working on the stage i'm like coordinating with the volunteers and
i'm doing all this other stuff that i i didn't think that was prepared for in seminary you know
i didn't learn how to do all that they wanted me to do like essentially marketing for them
you know i was doing translating sermons from english to spanish and also fulfilling other
ministry related things like uh fulfilling prayer requests and doing um like marital counseling so
i was in there like monday through sunday you know and it became my everything and so i'm like
a year in it's like you know i i miss my family i don't you know as a pastor i'm i'm hardly ever
home because you're there in the morning and then you're there until late and then you're expected to
be part of like extracurricular activities as a pastor and like visiting small groups and like
you know leading workshops in on saturday it's so draining it is really can i just
get on to butt in there quickly and just i had i had the associate pastor tell me he asked me
how many how many hours are my leaders volunteering when i was a youth pastor my volunteers and
i'd be like well you know there's this person does this many hours and they help set up on a
friday and they do half a day there and then they and you know maybe like 14 hours a week
which was a lot for some and then he's like well if you're expecting them to do 14 hours
volunteering you should be doing at least 14 hours on top of your job so that's how they
like get you like it's like and then and there's things like tuesday night prayer meeting or you
know like that's that's just seen as like a thing that you go to not like that's not considered
volunteering you're just being a part of the church family so it becomes i can feel you so
his hips all encompassing like really quickly like your whole life becomes the church yeah yeah and
not to mention that you know you've got to go out and do evangelism you know and so it it becomes
like where you're never you know you're hardly ever home you don't have a weekend i was used to
having a weekend because prior while i was good working on my way through seminary i i was already
in the dental field and i was a lab tech and doing a lot and i had a professional work environment
experience prior to working in ministry so a lot of my friends they they never got had a job
elsewhere and so i don't think that they could like compare apples to apples you know i just
felt like man the church experience is so different the politics are so different uh it just doesn't
feel like like the american dream you know this is something different what they actually asked
what's a pastor's salary and it's great to see by the way it's great to see i kill bill d
pragmatic crystal um sharyl it's great to see so many of you guys carry it's so many
carry in so many good so many people who keep davis so good to see everyone in the chat
but what is a pastor's salary in america yeah so i mean if you're like a hired pastor like an
associate pastor that i was are you probably making anywhere between like 40 70 a year if you're
if you're lucky um now if you have your own church i'm not so sure and i don't even know how that works
but yeah um yeah so money is not necessarily proportionate to the work that you put in my
opinion yeah oh 100 i was on i was on like 18 dollars an hour so minimum wage um and i only
worked i only did two days a week and then i had to do an extra two days volunteering
as well so i was pretty much working almost full time but i was only getting like a couple
hundred dollars a week kind of thing right yeah and that's australian dollars that's like that's
dolery dues that's oh yeah yeah yeah and then you've got a tithe oh yeah yep um and they really
do frown upon you if you don't you're not giving your 10 like that's that's expected 100 percent
i i heard of i heard of this church who did they passed around the um the the basket and they
did it every week and then one week they added a person with a camera so it was like a camera and
the basket and they they um as a like a as like a um as a sermon and obviously the tithings like
quadrupled like it went like through the roof that week and they were talking about how god sees
everything like you know like it's like it's like so it's like it's just so so manipulative
it's it's wild yeah oh yeah one of the things that was a very a shocker for me to experience was
you heard of like these uh uh capital raise uh campaign where they're raising money for some church
thing we went through that yeah so like we're gonna remodel the the main auditorium and build
more classrooms and expand children children's ministry you know 20 million dollars later kind
of and so as a pastor you have to promote that so we were basically coached into organizing small
small groups and so where we can go there and discuss and and get people enrolled and and
sign up as many pledges as possible and it was disgusting yeah um we bring consultants from
consulting firms about this like there are experts that come to churches to provide you
know best practices to organize this whole campaign to raise money and um i remember at the end like
they wanted um from us anywhere between 10 20 000 dollar commitment um and yeah and we ended up saying
no we you know we just can't um and i think i you know we say you know from you like do you mean
from your team or do you mean from you and just like us personally yeah oh whoa yeah so i'm like
you know i'm still paying uh school loans for seminary and uh we have two young children you
know and it's like yeah we just can't like honestly we just can't give more yeah that's
insane that's we didn't experience the the worst thing that i experienced um have you have you seen
the wolf of wall street the movie uh huh yeah you know that scene where um jordan balford is like
are you are you behind in your payments great pick up the phone and start dialing you know are you
is your landlord going to kick you out pick up the phone and start dialing i went to a plan to
shake his conference and it was literally like that this guy had money and he would put it on the
stage and you put it on the stage and you'd be like um are you are you wanting a new um new uh career
or you're wanting that promotion at work good start tithing and he puts he's like this is for
my promotion he's like do you want a um healthy relationship here more this is and he's just like
kept putting more money on the stage and like stepping it back as he put money on the stage like
you want a beautiful family here put money on he's like start tithing because if you give to
god's house it'll come back seven fold and everyone's like ah give me all the money after
they spent thousands of dollars on the tickets and and merch and cds and dvds and and all that it's
absolutely insane yeah and it's not like something that just takes place over a weekend
like a months long campaign where they're just you know pushing it on your face
and uh i remember like my pastor um my my supervisor he confronted me about it he's
like hey what's going on you're not uh you're not gonna pledge this i'm like no like personally
he approached me to confront me about that i'm confused with this how do they know what how
much you're pledging or like how much your role is they just put cash in the bucket they kept track
of everything another thing that shocked my world was learning that my pastor the lead pastor knew
who was our top payers our top top tithers i remember one day he asked me hey do you know who
our number one tither is like who gives the most i'm like what it's like yeah you know who it is
and he gave me the name like how do you know that well you know we keep track so they know
they have metrics you know um yeah and that's the other thing it's it's all about the numbers too
you know i was charged with increasing church attendance you know it was my responsibility
um and so yeah i mean you have ushers that are clicking everyone that comes in every day
because they're like making sure they're they're tracking all the numbers so it just becomes it's
it's really much a business you know very much like i don't know maybe a fancy gym or a spa
fancy spa that's selling memberships people come in they get you know lured into this
and you know it's that's how you do it these churches become mega churches yeah
one of the uh one of the churches it's not really mega it's a couple of thousand people
probably last probably like 500 on sunday um in brisbane my my my boss actually went there
and he said i think it was like four or five times he got introduced it's the same guy introduced
himself to him like hey how you doing it's great my name's x it's great to see you and he's like
yeah we we chatted last week and like there's this fake like welcome to the family you know and like
but they're not even remembering your name or your face and like you're there every week and it's
just like you just get introduced the same person comes up to you like they've never met you like
welcome yeah yeah and that's all like you train your volunteers to do that yeah i was in charge of
that you know we put people like outside the church already greeting you before you come in
and then as you come in and that whole ushering of it that's all that you're trying to make these
people feel super special yeah and so it's all programming it's all it's all predetermined
and yeah and it works and and and that's the thing is it works really well and and even like i had
friends i was never musically talented or anything but i had friends in in the in the band and they
would go away to band like worship camp or whatever and they would learn how to be good worship leaders
and they would say things like you want to use this chord if you're writing a song you want to
use this chord and then go to one of these chords or you want to do this and then do this because
that will get someone's emotional state ready to receive god and people will people there aren't
going like oh this is a scam this is a great idea they're going wow what beautiful talent and gifts
that god's given us to you know open people's hearts towards god i was told as a preacher that
my job as a preacher was to get people to walk to the end of the diving board and then jump off
into god into jump off into god's spirit into god's presence and that that was the whole whole
goal so if i was going to be a bit manipulative in my old school and classic one is going i want
everyone to close their eyes and like i want you to raise your hand if you feel your heart beating
and that's god that's god calling you i'm going to count to three one god loves you he's he's
perfect for you like he right now there is this angels in this room and they're surrounding you
if you feel god calling you in your heart that's that's that's uh that's the holy spirit two um
this is the most important decision of your life you know and i'm doing the countdown doing all
these like little things and that's okay because i'm just getting people to walk to the end of the
diving board i'm getting them to move past their flesh so they can move into the spirit and so when
you look at it from the outside it's like so manipulative it's like it's like gaslighting
in the entire congregation and if you're really good at it you're like you know that's that's the
people who sell books and pastor mega churches and become friends of justin bieber and like you
know that's that's it yeah for sure i mean it's and it's all by design all of that is by design i
remember um so for every for every um sunday service for every yeah every weekly service
we would have a midweek sermon preparation meeting and so i was part of this meeting on a weekly
basis and i got to see you know how the church kind of goes on about getting ready for that
weekend service and it's it's amazing it's just like an executive meeting you've got the senior
pastor you've got the worship minister and his tech assistant guy and then you have
communications director who's an expert in like marketing and brand the whole thing about the
brand of the church she's there and then there's a couple of other people my supervisor and they're
going through like all right this is how the service is going to go and you know the everyone
knows already like what the message is going to be about and like what the series is and they've
already pre-decided like what kinds of music that they're going to be using in that for that series
the color schemes that we're going to be designing the stage on everything that's going to be
published online or you know handouts all that is already pre-designed and and like when it comes
to like the music choices and all that is all by design like all right so if the message is
going to lead me to compelling people to surrender to christ we need to make sure that we have this
kind of song follow or while i'm doing the prayer play this immediately after you're going to play
a that song and then you and then the worship minister is going to lead them to prayer and
do this about and then emphasize this aspect of it and it's like it's all of it you it's a it's a
it's a theatrical it's uh yeah it's show business but it's you know when when you're kind of in it
you're like this is great this leads people to god this is like these are just we're just doing
things well to to leave do you i have to ask before we jump into like your deconstruction and why
you started deconstructing do you have a preaching voice you know i hated that actually
yeah i never got into that that's why that's why you didn't laugh long you had to have a preaching
voice um i was told like yeah you'll find your voice and everything but i just i never really
cared about the theatrics of it i was more like um you know i want to be able to communicate
the message and i want to do it correctly and i want to do it to the best of my ability honoring
the god that inspired it yeah and you want to be good at it i want to be accurate i want to be
effective and you know it shouldn't be up to my own preachy uh self it should be about the message
the message itself should be what's transforming lives not how i'm saying it um but yeah i never
really cared for the preacher voice i never i never think i really got a preach the voice but
we went to a recent carols on the river which is run by some local churches and it's mainly secular
that there's there's a jesus message in there sometimes and this year it was run by the local
hill song pastor and um or he was doing the message and i apologize i'm gonna i'm gonna try and do
the voice but he gets up on stage and you're like who's this dude he's like wearing cool
clothes he's like a cool looking motherfucker you know what i mean and um yeah he gets up and he goes
i've got what he's um what who he called out but he goes he gets up on the mic it's really quiet
let's just finish some carols and he goes billy and there's a big pause and then he goes billy
again there's a big pause and he's like billy a third time and then he's like you see my my
cousin billy he'd always run around and he'd be looking and climbing trees and we were looking for
billy and then like you talk like that right and then he's like and when billy was really young
we one night we we couldn't find him he wasn't in the bed and we looked outside and we saw him
and he was on the chicken coop so we went outside we're like billy what are you doing and he was
reaching up to the stars and he's like dad if only i can touch the stars i'll be able to touch
heaven he wanted billy he said billy wanted to touch heaven but what billy didn't understand is
that the only way to get to heaven is through jesus and like it's like that whole like yeah
fucking and it makes me like i'm getting goosebumps it makes me cringe i hate it so much
but it was like i watched this and i was sitting there like oh my god like i was i was feeling
internal like feelings that i haven't felt in so long it made me kind of calm it made me kind of
anxious and made me like conflicted and like i really i didn't like it but i knew it was happening
to me but but it was it was effective um in this message but that was such a such a classic australian
like youth pastor style preach if you want to know more about jesus we've got people here that you
know like and it's just like fuck you can shut up like yeah oh god isn't that hill song is that
that's an australian uh thing yeah yeah hill song started in sydney but we've got churches all over
the world now and you know there's churches in new york and stuff and and there's the nusa church
we got friends that are part of the nusa church and the nusa church was running that that section
i'm sure the pastor's a nice dude or whatever but he's just in the source you know i mean like he
just he's good at what he does he talks in the in that accent in that way and uh and tells like
a deep voice yeah yeah yeah just like uh i mean the american style is a little bit different isn't
it it's like a bit more like
like it's very like um like yeah that sounds like no one can touch my god like it's very
like titty jakes very like you know like that's the vibe like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the
yeah that's that southern thing you know the southern rap oh wow um so so you've you've like
now gone through um in your story you've gone through bible college you've gone through seminary
when do you start to doubt and of course you know you're you're a beautiful wife
apostate and you've got children together she's a christian at the time how does that how does
that work how do you are you deconstructing together what tell us a little bit about that
yeah so well i feel like i should kind of maybe say a couple of things about the ministry experience
and then we move on to the deconstruction and apostate and uh so at the church a couple of
things happened one um was the whole thing about the money and i've me feeling like they you know
they just really cared more about the money than cared about me and stuff but then i had a i had an
incident with with a director of technology guy like the tech guy the main techie guy and this was
like maybe about a month into my tenure there so i was brand new and uh there was something i was
giving a directive like hey you know this sunday we're gonna need choir risers and so but um i'm
like okay so what do we get those and then he's like you talk to this guy and then he'll hook you up
or whatever so i contacted him like hey uh you know this sunday we're gonna need choir risers at the
hispanic auditorium so can you help us out he's like yeah sure don't worry and then um coming to
find out he meant for me to go get them myself and then install them at our stage but i thought that
he was just he would just say you know because he had like assistants and a whole team of people that
did stage stuff in this situation i had to go to get it myself so i ended up not knowing that i had
to go get it i just assumed that they would drop it off is what i did probably and then come in to
find out on sunday they weren't there so i'm like hey um the choir risers they're not on on stage
he's like yeah you gotta come get them i'm like okay um like i'm preaching in 10 15 minutes like
there's no way and so he came out and confronted me personally to like explain to me the situation
i thought at first but he got really angry at me and like um got it on my face and and made a fist
like that like he got terribly insulted because i'm like hey i thought that you were gonna drop
him off or something like i was just trying to clarify my misunderstanding of what he you know
how things work here i'm brand new and he got real defensive and mad at me and i then confided
to my senior pastor like what happened i'm like hey this situation happened it was a misunderstanding
he got really upset with me and threatened me you know by getting to my face and making a fist at
me like hey you know um i forget exactly what he said but um so anyway as a result of that my
supervisor then got in touch with his supervisor and organized a meeting for us to hash it out
well i show up a little bit earlier to the scheduled time and it was enough where it was
like maybe 10 15 minutes early and i'm like sitting there waiting and i noticed that they were already
meeting with him like my supervisor was already with the guy that i had the incident with
and his supervisor and they were already talking uh for a while so when i got there and to share
my side of the story they had already it seemed like they were just circling the wagons on
because they made it pretty pretty clear that you know i it was i was out of character or something
like that is what they were charging me with so it was kind of disappointing because i felt like
hey i'm kind of like the whistleblower here i'm the guy who just got like you know bullied and
and it was my fault you know so that was that was pretty bad um but then you know ministry
continued on and you know kind of water under the bridge situation and then towards the end
of the year i end up getting fired but or let go for some other reason and well the reason
that they're going to tell me is perhaps not the real reason i may not know the true reason why
they let me go but long story short at the end of the year we have like this retreats where we are
like with the elders and we're talking about next year and like what worked this year and what you
know what we want to do for the next year and one of the ideas that i championed at this meeting was
hey we really should hire a full-time worship pastor because at the time we had a part-time guy
that you know i felt like he you know he wasn't really you know doing a service like the quality
needed to improve like i'm in charge of uh keeping people on the seats i'm in charge of the numbers
like it's my responsibility to fill the pews and it's like okay i think we need to improve in these
areas and one of those we need a someone that's gonna be more of a professional to run the worship
ministry and which wasn't necessarily widely accepted when i voiced it but later after the
meeting and everything he they ended up deciding like now this is the elders and the main senior
pastor that they were indeed going to hire a new worship pastor but that there was not going to be
enough budget for myself and him and essentially what they were going to do they were going to hire
someone from out they ended up hiring somebody from out of town that was uh kind of a famous dude
because you have these superstars in evangelical worship ministry that are hired in different
places they brought someone from out of town and now they can't afford us both and so they're like
you know so we're sorry we know we're going to have to let you go because we can't and you're
welcome to continue to be part of our ministry and be part of this but we just can't have you on staff
and so we're sorry and i was like major shocker and you know it destroyed me because i'm like
i'm thinking here i am like a year later after i have rooted my entire family we bought a house we
you know like i said we poured ourselves into this new community and made all these friends and
we did the ministry thing and so now we need to look elsewhere um because i you know i need i need
a salary you know so but that wasn't it though if that was the only thing maybe i would have just
guide hired somewhere else because you could understand you know money is real so but they
were like um but here's the thing though we don't want you to say that and and so here's what we do
want you to say and if they had they gave me a piece of paper and it had written basically what
i would eventually read sunday morning and i'm like okay um and so the statement read like something
like um i was leaving the ministry to pursue other interests and that's why we're saying goodbye
so there was no mention of we're gonna we don't have enough funds there was no mention of
we're going on a different direction hiring a full-time worship pastor
instead of an associate pastor it was just simply that um i had other interests and so i was leaving
and saying goodbye and so yeah so dishonest so dishonest well sure it's just a lie it's just a
blatant lie blatant lie yeah it was i mean it wasn't um it nothing remotely close to the situation
boring for jesus yeah and um apocet and felt horrible like she felt disgusted by it
she didn't even want to because they made us well i say made but they were like yeah
we want you to this was on wednesday when they let me go they're like we want you to come back on
sunday morning so that you can give we so that we can give you proper goodbyes um and that's
when i would read that statement and say goodbye she didn't want to be part of it it's like i'm not
gonna go upstage i'm not gonna do that and uh i ended up like almost like not forcing but i'm like
let's just do this and get out like because i didn't want people to think that there was anything
wrong or going um going bad between me and my wife because that's the first thing that a lot
of people think is like who some sin happened yeah are you getting fired you're getting you're
getting fired you did something yeah and so i don't know especially if you're on the stage
with you it's like oh it's a it's a it's an infidelity sin like the sexual sin or something
yeah exactly if she's not there with you then so she was um kind enough to do it and she you know
we all went upstage and said goodbye to this congregation um and so that was very hard for us
we we at the time we hadn't fully we hadn't even thought about deconversion or anything about
that we were just like what are we gonna do what am i gonna do you know i've i've given you know the
last um nine ten years of of of bible education that um i just don't feel like i want to be in
ministry anymore like that just doesn't seem like something i want to go back to but let's give
ourselves some time and you know we gave we gave us a couple of years because we felt like i don't
know maybe maybe you know maybe you're just burned out and you need some time need some space and then
you can get back into the ministry and so we did that and then tried to go back to a church and
it just didn't feel like anything was the right fit for us anymore because we felt like um
even if you're in a different church like you see the same things you get the same energies of
just manipulating people yeah oh man yeah so that that is it's actually making me quite emotional
because um it's so similar to to like not exactly but but like when i because i was only
youth pastor i wasn't a youth pastor for long maybe even less i probably think less than a year
but the way that it happened for me is i was hired by the senior pastor given to the care of the
associate pastor the associate pastor told me from the start who's now the senior pastor
that he doesn't think that i'm ready for ministry i was too young i was only 19 fair enough uh and so
i i think he started like essentially a campaign to to kind of remove me sounds conspiratorial
but he probably gave me a few few chances he gave me books to read and things like that and i never
did like probably commit to it i guess to his like style of leadership but i remember specifically
one time uh it came to um this like we had these weekly meetings and he said well you know you need
you need adults around you to help guide you and i was like totally totally there like and he's like
we need to like turn you into the youth pastor you need to be to take on this youth and i was like
yeah yeah exactly yeah and he's like so why don't we get like a team of adults around you he's like
cool he's like who do you have in mind i was like well these people these people these people
chose a bunch of people he chosen people and we had this like team of people that would like
come in like sit in on meetings and like kind of like just be there for me and we could like work
stuff out um help plan events do things um and then only a few weeks later he was like hmm
if all these adults are helping you Dave why are you getting paid and they're not getting paid
and then i was like oh yeah true and i was like yeah that's a that's a very good point and he's
like you know if we really want to want to like get this ministry going like that that feels unfair
right i was like yeah it does and i was like and then he essentially talked me into resigning
so i resign with the idea that i'm resigning so the youth ministry has more money um with my wage
and then i'm working as a volunteer as the youth pastor but in a team of adults right and i've never
told this story before on publicly and then we go to our first wednesday meeting and i'm my first
leaders meeting with the the all the leaders there and i'm like all right guys and i'm stepping
up to the plate i'm like here's you know this is this is time for me to step up the plate i'm
going to really show everyone that i can do this so i start running running a meeting and this other
person starts budding in all the time i'm like what are they like what why are they just like
constantly like like trying to kind of run the meeting and i'm trying to kind of run the meeting
so i went up to them afterwards i was okay i'm a little bit confused with what's going on
and they said oh yeah the um you know i won't say his name but pastor told us that we'll be
taking over the youth ministry i was like no no that's not that's not right obviously like this
it was very clearly i i chose to step down to help the ministry and then us as a group of adults
would help run the ministry until i'm ready to kind of take that role again like i was i was very
naive in believing that they were telling the truth so i was like let's organize a meeting so we
have a meeting we come in and i'm like pastor uh they they seemed to you know i was like we had a
bit of a an issue the other day at this leader's meeting where you know they were they were trying
to run the meeting and i was trying to run the meeting um and i was like you know but like are
they across the board and we start this meeting and i still remember they said this person this
pastor said well you know the position of youth pastors really up the effort anyone to have
and my my jaw like dropped and i was like what do you mean and then i realized that he'd been
talking to these other adults saying hey maybe you might be able to take over the youth ministry
and then he'd been telling me well this is what i assume anyway and then telling me that you'd be
taking over the youth ministry but what how was like told to me and why i stepped down from my
position was it was like you just need some more training you need these adults to come um around
you and all this stuff and so yeah like long story short i got kind of like slowly weaseled
out of that position and uh eventually you know the youth ministry when i took it over was like
120 people coming on friday night uh it would drop a lot because we lost a lot of people and
change of leadership you know we've got down to probably like 70 or 80 people and then you know
shortly after when i lost the job and was no longer in the position of youth pastor was no longer in a
position of uh leadership eventually it was like 10 or 15 people coming on a friday night and there
was like facebook groups of these youth starting like petitions saying bring back dave and like
all this stuff and i was just like oh that's cute but it's not going to happen um not because
anything i wouldn't do but it was heartbreaking it was like horrible uh it was like it was uh i took
it very seriously like ministry i i really truly believed that um i had a vision from god for whether
youth ministry was going to go i believe that i told all my leaders this story like this like
this is where we're going there's green pastures over the hill like follow me we're doing this like
let's do this and we're walking through the mud and then i was forced to leave the mud and all the
leaders are sitting there going you you promise us green pastures and now there's like we're in this
mud and i felt incredible amount of responsibility incredible amount of um uh pain like i went through
years of pain a lot of pain because of that um yeah so it's yeah breaks my heart hearing your
story i can totally empathize yeah yeah and i think um i too was heartbroken about it because
you know you come in thinking i finally made it i'm working with like the people of and you
know the men and the women of god and you know this this should be different right
it should be at least very different than the world the cruel world that i was also
and so uh but that's not the case you know there there there's no mercy like uh
it's it's really it comes down to the numbers comes down to the money uh if that's okay the
numbers are good the money is good then and we're good but the if the money and the numbers are
not good then no one's good and so yeah so um we tried and it just didn't feel right
and then you could fast forward maybe five to six years later uh we're still not going to church
we're still not uh i'm not pursuing ministry at all i'm not even thinking about it i went back to
the field of dentistry that i was working while i was in school and um yeah never looked back
so when did you start deconstructing or when did you first start going maybe this when did
because you mentioned having this i can't mention it but like having these ideas that you don't have
time to look into when you're a pastor that you learn in seminary ministry college
uh bible college when did you start to like i guess unpack those things again and go let's
let's have a look at this yeah i'd say like right around the pandemic maybe that's starting
to be a cliche um but yeah i have to be honest i started um listening to podcasts about bible
studies listening to um matt de la hunti as well because yeah i mean does god even exist
because you're you're thinking well uh it really seems like this book is not divinely inspired
it may be just a work of men so naturally let's wonder if even there's even a god behind all this
some way somehow uh but even philosophical arguments they there's just not enough evidence for
or i'd say anyone to believe that actually there is a god you know so along that um i'm listening
to the scholars that are being featured in myth vision uh oh there's your second mistake
yeah and so see that was in seminary they you know they warn you about these liberal
yeah these liberal scholars that are to be avoided at all costs
Bart Ehrman and Leighton Pagel like oh where the yeah oh yeah Leighton Pagel's here yeah um
put on drum of ear and then get back to work yeah yeah um but i remember that in um
i think it was uh one of those introduction to the New Testament Gospels
courses that i took by Daryl Bach he was uh he's like one of those evangelical
historical jesus uh academics in favor of the historical jesus from Dallas Seminary he um
as part of the course he assigned Bart Ehrman's introduction to the New Testament
oh yeah and so i started reading that and i'm like you know he definitely has a different
perspective on this and so what's that all about i mean it's got the oxford public you know publishers
you know on on the hardcover so it must be it must be good that the stuff he's saying it doesn't
line up with what they're teaching me here and so i think that sort of fit my interest to to look
elsewhere at the very least um and then and then it's like all right well let's really let's let's
dig uh dig deep as to what they're saying because you know i think it's worth it right so then i'm
getting books by you know other um academics and it's like yeah no they don't seem to agree and
it really does seem that the only ones that are believing that this is true are like my
fellow evangelicals but once you go outside of theological seminaries like at the universities
that's not the case anymore um they're not trying to necessarily
promote their dogmas their dogmas they're thinking like historians or they're thinking like archaeologists
or they're thinking like language experts they're not trying to just say yeah this is true
and these are the reasons why so yeah i mean um slowly but surely i came across a lot of other
insights that perhaps um put this you know that's the stamp of approval i would say
the stamp of certification you would say
um did you have did you have a moment was there a moment when you're like oh
should i don't believe anymore i did yeah i did have a moment where i'm like um you know
i just don't think there's a god anymore and i remember like we we were having a conversation
because usually what would happen is on a daily basis i would come home and play a video or um
reading a book and and then i pass it and and i would like circle back and be like all right so
what did you learn today and she would tell me oh i learned this and that i'm like yeah and i also
read this and so and so said dad and we would just like have this uh dialogue on on the daily
and one day we just looked at each other and like you know what you know i because she really
hesitated because she felt like for the longest time i was just very much like this fundamentalist
bimbal thumper guy so she was like scared to tell me
but then when she says something like you know what me too i think that's i feel the same way
and um and so then from then on it was just like yeah um this is this is obviously um
this is obviously problematic yeah well
that's incredible man it was it was it was good yeah it was really it was really good for us
as a couple too because we wrestled with a lot of like you know like those biblical concepts of
like hierarchy at the home and leadership yeah you know yeah and and and so we always struggled
with with that like i never felt like um it worked you know like you other are being a tyrant to
your wife um and so yeah i mean for us to find out that hey you know the way that we've been
raised and you know and with the way we learn how to think about
marital relationships and people and like politics and all that has been tainted by this
fundamentalism that's very toxic and so we changed i mean i was along with being an evangelical i was
i was a conservative political politically speaking i was very hardcore uh into all that
and and and that also changed too so yeah it's been life transforming
yeah i just relate so much to your story like it's uh it's um i think the first time i came to
aim you with anything was i i think i was i read the book love wins by rob bell oh yeah back when
but but this is before i was deconstructing i was just like i'm gonna read the secret text
the text that got him to you know to i know it's fake you know it's not real but i'm gonna see
what his arguments were and i read it it's not convincing but um but but at the time it was like
huh and i'm almost saying to Amy i was like what if there is no hell or heaven and um Amy's my
wife and um and Amy's like um i don't like to think about that i don't want to think about that
like that i don't like to think that there is no heaven or hell or like i i and it's funny
because just that thought that one question and thought and and Amy's reaction we didn't really
talk about that but like a couple weeks later Amy was like you know what if this is our one life
i want to like live it to the fullest i want to like you know i want to see as many musicals as i
want to see i want to exercise i want to climb mountains i want to travel i want to have kids
i want to you know i want to like embrace life because if this is all we have you know what's
the what's the downside because not all we have what's the downside we just live an amazing life but
but i think that the trap is when you get caught up in the ministry world and the church world is
you start to treat this life like a a doormat for the next life you start to treat it like a
doormat that you wipe your feet on before you go into the next life you don't necessarily worry
about um like retiring you know about having a good career i told my i told my younger brother
who's just finished his career now but i told him like 15 years ago uh i um i said what good say uh a
university degree in heaven leo and he was like good point this is fresh out of school good point
Dave and didn't go to university and now but you know 10 years later he finally decided to go back
to go to university and get a degree but like dumb advice like that is just like rampant in
like oh yeah i got that advice too like hey you don't need to go to seminary be a pastor
yeah yeah yeah you know um but i think some of them they know like maybe if you learn too much
you're gonna get in trouble um you know like if you go actually and learn stuff um at the
you know a higher education level that you might be convert like i think some of them they
share that perspective that you're better off not uh receiving a higher higher education
because of that reason do you uh before we before we uh because we're coming up to 90 minutes but
i want to quickly plug a couple of things and i've got some more questions and can you go over a
little bit if if you don't um yeah yeah yeah yeah cool uh so first of all everyone should go check
out your podcast um the apostate of mind podcast it's really really cool um good stuff and i think
this is where i first saw you guys um oh matt pal oh he's he's he's the best i really appreciated
your video on i don't think i finished it but i like what you were putting down the isai isai 53
episode um i'd love to talk to you more about that but that's that was really good you can see
i watched a fair bit of it but um go check out the apostate on mind podcast it's linked in the
description of course and you also have a spanish um youtube channel for people who are spanish
speaking and um and that's here as well so that's also actually i don't think it is linked let me
just drop it in the comments down below um yeah in fact um i'm kind of a johnny come lately when
it comes to not only when it comes to the having deconstructed but um starting a channel so we
we've only been doing this for about a year but before i started my own channel i was part of
nuestra experiencia at tea and uh there are more than just a channel it's a community on facebook
and we're like friends now with a large group of people um that speaks spanish and it's our
atheist experience and i'm there live every sunday we do bible study for example we are currently
in our study of deuteronomy we've done we're completing the first five books of moses
and so deep you can see that uh that's our 77th episode so we've done a lot of bible study there
is it is it in spanish or english it's all in spanish yep yeah cool um and then we do a live um
broadcasts where we welcome we have um a panel of a guy who's so so so smart his name is uh
rafa and he's like all into philosophy and and then i've got another guy nathan that's uh
a historian and he knows a lot about christianity and religion um and then there's a couple of
ex-jehovah witnesses that are part of the team tell is the vtuber guy who's the caricature
he's an ex-jehovah's witness and then there's alma who's also an ex-jehovah's witness and she's
so bright and so it's it's a great panel of people and that we do that every sunday so that
that's awesome so if you speak spanish check out that and then there's also a positive mind
for us um english speakers which is also great as well and sort of post it in on there which is
great too um yeah cool as well as well links in the description and links in the chat um
but i i actually i i really wanted to ask you um a question that d actually just posted as a super
chat so thank you so much d for the super chat this tenor super chat um d was one of the original
deep drinks um 12 disciples on patreon um so she's all she'll always have a special place
in my heart but did leaving the church change your opinion on social or political issues how did
how much did your brain shift after leaving the bubble yeah so as i mentioned i was very much a
republican conservative uh conservative and um and um i think i you may have voted for trump
his first uh you know
a burning shame shame yeah drastically drastically changed so it's it's funny because
because mine i was the same i wasn't necessarily like staunchly conservative or anything uh i'll
remember being shocked to find out that it was the christians who had the guns in america
i was like what do you mean the guns are evil like i'm australian though like i just couldn't
believe that anyway um but uh that's just my dumb australian perspective but for me i was the same
i i actually uh there's something that i said to amion this is this is kind of what i want to
jump off with you is how did it affect raising your kids because for me when we had when we were
planning going through ivf and planning to have a kid and we eventually had atlas before that i was
writing down all these things like oh oh no like oh shit like what what are our values
because we can't just point to the bible and say stealing is wrong anymore so like is stealing
wrong like i wanted to get really fundamental and it's like what is what makes a good person like
what's what do we value in life um for me was you know i actually wrote a list of things like
being kind to people um which i don't always do all the time on twitter um you know um uh honesty
integrity um facing your fears things like that like these these were all like things that i
i thought were good virtues i'm being honest i'm telling the truth uh but like how did you know
like there's this this this perspective that when you leave christianity or when you leave a religion
you just you just like you drive straight from church to your local orgy and you have an orgy
for a little while and then you murder some kittens and then you you know drive to go do heroin
and like the back of some like van like essentially like what do you where where you well how do you
like where do you get your values from now where do you get your morals from like what do you teach
your kids uh so i mean when it comes to like morality and everything um i think that that
still kind of remains the same um but i think it's it's improved i think our morality has to improve
in the sense that you know you know you're no longer thinking that you need to do something
a certain way because uh you're gonna displease a god you know you're gonna end up getting sent
to hell if you're thinner uh whereas now it's more like you really are just considerate of other
people and their well-being and it's not a matter of my consequence my eternal consequences
but more like you know what is just what is good for others and myself so i think it puts
it in a different healthier perspective that's certainly a less selfish uh perspective which
is something that you wouldn't you certainly wouldn't see it that way if you're in in the church
you're thinking you're honoring god and that's your job and that's your call to do but you're
just really trying to please or you know um so i think that makes things better when it comes to
our children i'd say that it did affect greatly in the sense that i remember you know they're now
13 actually 14 and 15 so when we when we when we started deconstructing they were right at that
age where i think they in school perhaps they started like wondering about things like sexuality
and stuff like that like one of my kids went through a phase where she thought that she was by
who and i remember that um i i gave her like a haircut that would like fade the back of her head
it's kind of a tomboy type of haircut uh that she ended up like wearing and her you know she
changed clothing and she was a little more tomboyish and that's something that i would have never like
allowed as a christian like no like god you know very binary yeah it's shameful for a woman
to cut her hair right oh my gosh so but fortunately for our kids like we had already we started like
you know getting rid of all that garbage and so we were very i think we were very supportive of
their face and and and helping them figure out you know who they are and what they like and
all that stuff so um i think they greatly benefited from us changing it was a shocker for them because
like we you know we were like church people and then in a matter of like three four years like it's
all behind us yeah we baptized our kids in our backyard um it was that kind of you know yeah
family i was uh i'm the oldest of my cousin so like my family my grandmother always like looked up
on me and like she was like the family pastor you know and so like i felt like i always had
the responsibility for like leading prayer like getting people together like organizing
christmas and thanksgiving you know i was involved in all that stuff and it's like okay well no i'm
not doing this anymore don't even ask me to pray yeah um and that kind of thing so
yeah you know the family adopted when we have friends over now um like just non-religious
friends we're about to have dinner if we're if we're sitting around a table or grab everyone's
hands and like what i'm like let's say a prayer and i'm like dear neil de grass ties thank you for
giving us the scientific methods like amen and it's just like i was like what the hell super weird
but um but yeah i like a big thing for me too was um lgbt uh right and like i realized like oh
shit a lot of my a lot of like what i subscribe to for most of my life was causing great harm
great great harm to many people just just having the ideology um and when i started to
to like not i wasn't ever like anti uh gay or anything or whatever like that oh
actually i'm catching myself maybe i wasn't high school no definitely wasn't high school
surface level though not like deep hatred or anything i just was a classic teenager but
in australia which is sad but i've tried to like really become an ally to the um lgbt community
because i just i just see the harm that churches have done and and still do uh we we recently had a
local church um walk all through our community like through our streets like they passed it going
i'm starting a church like making a little video i'm starting a church and i commented and i said
you know will your church be accepting of lgbt folks and um and he private messaged me because
he said these things can get complicated and he wrote this big thing about like some people you know
they they find that god calls them away from their homosexual lifestyle and i said that that's
cool and i said but what about slavery you know like would you would you vote slavery back in
you know and then of course they just disappeared but but like it was it was realizing the harm
that i guess for me that like the christianity had done to the lgbt community islamist doing
and christianity is still doing to the lgbt community what religion does um and how it
actually affects them um you know is uh it made me kind of sick my stomach so i try very much to be
uh an lgbt ally in fact i even say um the old joke is i say if atlas our little one-year-old
if he grows up to be straight i'll love him anyway like i you know i'm so i don't care if he's you
know gay trans whatever like he's totally accepted totally loved here i even try not to use like
gender affirming like um language with him like you're the best boy ever i'd be like yeah best
little dude i'll say or like oh how strong you are but i try not to i've maybe i've gone too far
but i'm trying to like balance out the world that's you know that's around him at the moment but um
but yeah so yeah i'm i'm the same i i've caught myself saying things to my kids like yeah so when
you do decide to settle down with a girl or a guy whatever right yeah i would never say like that
you know i would never i would never say that to my kids it's it's funny because you have to
you have to like i'm like it was like that sign felt episode where it's like oh i heard that they're
gay not there's anything wrong with that like you have to like it's like that so like i also kind
of catch myself i've purposely tried to be like um you know like i'll make like really crude jokes
you know about like oh when they're 16 they'll be running around you know having fingering people
as i'll say a fingering girls whatever i'll ever said once so like to my boys and then someone's
like all boys was like yeah true you can think we're fingering anyone like when they're 16 years
i'll run around you know so i mean that's a bit crass but the joke is like yeah you've got to
kind of correct these like perspectives because like yeah it's important but um mark i really
appreciate having you on and and you're you're a uh like from just what i've seen on apostate of
mind that you're a treasure trove of um of of content around the bible and we didn't even get
to touch really onto onto like some biblical scriptures and stuff so i'd love to continue
having conversations with you because i find that super interesting um and i really appreciate
you coming on and just for anyone um who didn't catch the start i have been sick last couple
weeks i apologize um in a couple of days we have a recorded episode that might be live for patreon
and then it'll be um sent out because the hosts don't the people i'm interviewing don't necessarily
want to go live um and it'll be about the resurrection not the resurrection the second
coming of jesus and how it never happened which is my perspective and then of course dr kip davis
is coming on soon we haven't set a date and d from the stasis month podcast and we're getting some
more people as well but stay tuned support us on patreon and of course check out the apostate of
mind podcast subscribe to it before you leave here today is there anything you want to say
my before we wrap up this interview um so i want to just say something that you touched upon a
little bit earlier um regarding just perspective on this life and having this one life one of the
things that really um caught my attention like it's still with me is i heard someone say and i
forget who forgive me i'm not knowing the source but something like you know we all have two lives
okay two lives but you don't start living the second and final one until you realize that
you have just the one and so that was really true for me because it was not until i realized that
this is really it this is it this is all i've got that i'm like well let's start living life then
and and now you now you become to now you start appreciating what you have more more so than
ever before and that's what i'm referring to as the second life because my former life was really
not not it that was something else that was actually death instead that's actually
really that is so profound i love that paul paul has just said carpe diem motherfuckers i love that
that's that's good um beautifully said thank you mark for coming on it's been an absolute pleasure
and thank you guys for bearing with me as i fight off um fight out of the grave of sheol i don't
know if i'm there yet again i did see that ben Shapiro was making rap music videos now so i
don't know what's going on but see you guys all in a few days love you all bye
you
