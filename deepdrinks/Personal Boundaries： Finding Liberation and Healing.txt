And it's an amazing moment of liberation when you can say, no, no, no, you don't get the key to my private spaces.
You don't get to tell me what I do or how I do it.
And I do not give you permission.
That's a moment of real liberation.
It's sometimes very difficult to get there, but it's important that people do get there.
Because once you're able to do that, your whole world opens up.
And I think that's when real healing and liberation can begin.
Yeah, for sure.
I'm so glad that my partner and I didn't have that problem with not being sexually compatible.
We just luck in the draw.
But I know so many people who, yeah, it must be so hard for them to end up in the bedroom, not know what to do and then hate it.
Like that would be a nightmare and what a horrible way to start a marriage.
