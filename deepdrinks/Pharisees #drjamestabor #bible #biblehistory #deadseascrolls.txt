Take Pharisees and Sadducees.
Not one single thing that I named of these 12
would apply to a Pharisee or a Sadducee.
So if we can profile a group in such a specific way,
these are not minor things.
These are literally like, what are you doing?
What are you about?
What do you believe?
Who is your leader?
What's your mission?
And Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls fit all of those.
