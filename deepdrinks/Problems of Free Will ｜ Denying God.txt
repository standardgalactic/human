Imagine being an Israelite, camped around Sinai,
for I forget how long it was, but it was a good amount of time.
And you're seeing every single day,
God in a pillar of cloud.
And every single night,
you see the raging fire outside the tent entrance.
And you see Moses' physical formation changed
when he comes down from the mountain.
And you see the ground open up to swallow up.
That like, you cannot have this existence and continue to,
and by the way, arguably the worst people in the Bible,
this particular first generation group of Israelites
that rejects God over and over and over,
that worships false idol after false idol after false idol,
that continues to pick up sticks on Sundays or Saturdays.
Like you cannot have this generation
who knows God so intimately,
who was brought out of slavery by him,
who rejected him and then say,
well, if we knew about him,
it would ruin our free will.
