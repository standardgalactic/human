the masturbation partner thing was a story that a friend of mine brought where the pastor wanted
the men to have an accountability partner. So if they felt the need to self-pleasure,
they're supposed to call a buddy and say, pray with me. And that's supposed to produce a cold
shower effect. And now you look back on it, you think this is so offensively inappropriate.
The permissions that the religion and the church elders and the parents and the
pundits and the pastors and the congregants, the permission they gave themselves to peer
in everybody's window and pass judgment upon them is just astounding.
