I was raised Baptist.
Very quickly picked up on the messaging
of where I belonged as a young girl and woman.
I saw all the women in the nursery or in the kitchen.
No women speaking, no women teaching,
no women preaching that was not acceptable.
And so I very quickly try to become that good girl.
You were exactly who they told you to be.
There was no room for your voice or your autonomy
or your own agency.
And I was like the poster child for purity culture
throughout the 90s and even into the 2000s.
There's a lot of trauma that purity culture
and just conservative religious upbringing had on me.
But for most of my life,
I tried to adhere to the dogma that was passed on to me.
And now being where I am today,
it is like the most beautiful sacred thing in my life.
And I'm so glad I've returned home to my sexuality.
Obviously, you know the story of the prodigal son
turns home after sinning.
So you kind of flip on your head.
You're saying, no, I've returned home from church.
Like I've left that environment.
