possible annual derrick knows everything christmas special so feel free to ask questions throughout
welcome derrick lambert what's up dude can i go ahead and disclaimer i don't know everything i just

how's things been it's man i am working i'm always working um with myth vision and it's snowing here
in washington state we don't have the greatest tires on our vehicle so my wife actually the
day was trying to get in our driveway and like the car has a mind of its own because of the snow
and ice and so she she's sliding down the hill of the driveway then down the hill in the road
and being uh someone from the south and just knowing how to drive through mud and crazy stuff
i was like watch this baby i got she was crying actually i was like watch this watch this
i'm going sideways pulling my car up the road and doing crazy stuff just trying to show off you

yeah thank you honey all right i know you can't see this that's why i want to lie to all of you
and just pretend like i'm doing something here no legitimately i don't think you can see that but this
is a list right and when i go to email academics it's like a job i look at it like you're getting hired
because they have something i want they have an insight they have a knowledge a skill set that i
want and i know that thousands of people they may not even know that they want it but next thing you
know they hear it and they're going wow i didn't know was that good so i'm going out here looking
as denis mcdonald one of the academics i interview says you're like uh uh what do you call me a fox
he said we scholars are groundhogs we did deep down in the ground looking for things treasures in the
earth but the fox runs around and finds out what the groundhogs have but he goes all over hunting
various groundhogs to discover what riches they pulled up out of the earth and he said you could dig
and go down and find them yourself and you do that from time to time but mainly what you do so well is you
discover all the other groundhogs works and you try to get the groundhogs to communicate
so i'm going to briefly as fast as i can blast through i've got islamic study highlighted here
which is dr shadi nasir shan anthony marayman putin hytham sidki robert hoyland steven shoemaker

morality and whether it's objective he's changed his mind over the years and then he also is the animal
guy who's big on like yeah equal for animals he wrote um he wrote animal liberation a fantastic
okay yeah and then last of course lorence kraus michael schermer andy tomson and john wathy which
these are just like i took one and it was like hey let's promote this thing let's put root off on the
front here um but that's just like the tip of the iceberg because many of these academics i've interviewed
multiple times multiple so that we can learn what they have to offer and that is my flex that is my
look at what i've done but it's really also like take us seriously and this is why i
sent it and many of the scholars right back oh my gosh look at what you've done how can i be part of that
so they want to join and do interviews and stuff it's it's it's really incredible and i see that
you've like you've even talked some guests on like you've had uh was it um sorry dr paula
frederickson i had no idea who she was i mean i'm not huge on the biblical school like i'm not
i'm not there like looking up the bible scholars every weekend i kind of i'll
read barter and stuff like that but i saw that and i was like i was like you what you went to a house
and you filmed some actual interviews is that right or like you flew over to her yeah so with paula
she's never interviewed with anybody um like what i did she's been on the news where she's had like
abc nbc whatever come to interview her especially back when she had uh when christians were jews i believe
or when one of her books that was an earlier publication like really i thought you meant like
old testament like when christians were jews no no no yeah no that's the interesting thing right
because we think of christianity like everybody's welcome it's a christ everybody jesus died for everybody
kind of thing but when christians were jews when you get really down into the detail the scholars are
saying the earliest fossil of christianity that we kind of think was a jewish sect
and in order to be a follower of christ you had to become a jew so like paul's opponents
are saying paul's wrong and some people argue that his opponents were the apostles or possibly
connected to the 12 in jews and they were saying no they need to circumcise and they need to follow
the Torah in order to be a christ follower i think i think without paul i've heard this before and
and this is why it's called sorry just before when i said that it was derrick came up with a name
that was obviously a joke i come up with a name but this is why i said that derrick knows everything
podcast because i feel like i've i've heard random things throughout the year and i i feel like
i'm just like fact-check them with you and you can tell me what the experts say so it's like
you're like my you're like my jesus to the god like the scholars are like i'm a mediator yeah you're my
mediator yeah um so um with with uh i've heard that if it wasn't for paul christianity would probably
still just remain a sect of Judaism like um this the pharisees or the pharisees is that right
is it possible it's it's hard to say if christianity would have not gone extinct completely because the
earliest sect went extinct well so did the pharisees and sages season stuff right like they don't
well there's still continuity to the rabbinic tradition so while one might argue that these
particular schools and groups stopped existing this is why people would say well christianity of
course didn't cease to exist because it evolves like all things um what what oh yeah yeah cut your dick
and follow me and i was like that's very funny i'm going to elation says in galatians five i can't
remember what verse this is what paul says he's like if you're gonna circumcise because the opponents
of paul are trying to convince everybody you if you want to be a christ follower you must do this
and he says if you go to cut the tip of your dick he's like paul says cut the whole dick off
he literally just says because wait where is he that's not in the is that in the new testament i've
also read past that part do we need to open this up and show you that our bible teaches you this
holy crap paul i should have i should have got this so wait before we jump into looking up down
verses on cutting our dicks off um i do want to say that we are thinking um we are drinking uh
delicious coffees this i got coffee in here yep yeah so um last time you're on uh derek you went
through we went through your journey um which had to do with your sober you know but people can
go watch that if they want to um and and you know what uh something has come across like i think deep
drinks has caused me to drink more than i'm i guess i'm comfortable with so starting next year
we're going to be doing dry january so the first two guests next year dry january um and i i guess i may
as well now i'm talking about i might as well just quickly uh plug the channel as well um so for
those who don't know deep drinks podcast we have conversations with the guests and we drink drinks
that the guest chooses and that sets the tone of the conversation sometimes chan and q comes on and
she makes us drink lots and lots of rum and that ends up being funny and sometimes there's a
deep conversation over coffee which is just as good um but coming up in january we have two awesome
guests we have um katelyn who is a expert in shintoism so i'm going to be learning about shinto
we're not shintoism sorry that's the wrong she's already correct me and i haven't even had a romp it's
just called shinto so we're going to be talking about shinto and anime which is going to be awesome
uh and then we'll also have uh becoming a d converted with setha andrew's the thinking atheist which
will be really awesome to uh find the interview someone who was uh such a um an important part of
my um deconstruction experience so he's a great guy too yeah met him in texas oh yeah cool yeah great
great guy very soft spoken just really fun that's good that's good yeah yeah he's um
so okay so i'm playing along with you here i'm purposely egging you in this okay because you've
called me the guy who knows everything and that's not true but go ahead go ahead no no so um sorry
oh for me for me everyone this is it's 4am for me um and i i for some reason um uh got to sleep
like two hours before i started to get up so like i'm a little bit loopy so you have to forgive
me if i'm not like following everything so well i'll watch this in the future i'm like wow
derrick was amazing so yeah where was i but let's go let's go into the bible it was okay
let the scripture man let's all right man turn to our turn to galatians five twelve brethren
all right all right all right this is the same bible i used through ministry college by the way
still got it strong going strong although i've forgotten where galatians is apparently
is before oh yeah got it galatians what sorry five verse 12 and read that yeah okay you gotta get
the context around it but go ahead it's it's feel free to all right i'll go from verse 11 brothers
i am still preaching circumcision why i'm still being persecuted in that case uh the offense of the cross
has been abolished as for those agitators i wish that would that they would go the whole way and
emasculate themselves cut your whole dick off yeah paul says it he's pissed off because his opponents
are telling his believers you aren't in christ you aren't you don't believe the true gospel if you
don't go and cut your dick head off now meaning wow circumcised so and then i've asked a deeper
question over the years because galatia the location where the this letter's been written to the
galatians in galatia there was a god named atas and anyone who knows the myth of atas there's also
a mystery religion here mystery cult and the cult of atas surrounding about the god atas who
literally cuts off in the story the dick involves the whole nine and bleeds out to death right in this
narrative and many of its i guess you'd call them priests shaman type priests that follow within the
tradition would do this they'd go into a frenzy and they'd emasculate themselves and i wondered i asked
myself okay look if this is the region this god lives in and he's speaking the gentiles that are converting
gentiles would have known about atas is this kind of a double edged sword
is pulsing like screw these guys these judaizers who are trying to make you circumcise and cut your penis off
you might as well go all the way and be like atas i wondered if this was a joke and then you'll bleed
it's like almost like like you bleed out as well like you'll die as well like you death you might as
well yeah he's saying because if you go that far too circumcised you're he pretty much points out you're
literally making the crucifixion of christ null and void like it doesn't even count because you're
you're over thinking the law is what's going to do this and it's not interesting interesting yeah
well that that's actually this is why i love going on and it's fascinating i'm someone said how many of
you guys are squirming right now uh we're starting off strong here talking about cutting off dicks uh 17 minutes
into the dick things podcast server is just scratching the surface and this is what i love about you
because you have like this the stuff that like i i listen to you talk on the show and on myth vision
podcast and i i'm i'm like you must have so many little hooks in your brain when someone says something
you're like it's like a domino effect you're like it's like you just you just have such a broad like
i said like i made it up in at the start that said you talked to more people on the um with these
expertise and anyone in the on earth but that that was i think a pretty would you say that's an accurate
assumption i don't know anyone else that would talk to so many it's such a i think there's more
there's more people out there that talk to more scholars than me but i mean no there are but it's
probably not in this niche the way that i'm doing it no yeah yeah yeah in your niche you have to be you
have to be the only well at least producing content on it because like it's just like i'm sure there's
there's like a board or something that oversees like scholars or something that you know they're
probably talk to more but you're like producing you you have so and they're such a wild you talked to
like richard carrey he's a mythicist he believes that that jesus never existed in a physical way right
that the jesus story and he's a historian right and then you talk to people who have written books
like against mythicism like barterman who's not a christian but he's he he's like no jesus was a real
historical figure like right so um so i'm i'm uh i'm wondering like how much we need to go in to detail
on on all these things i see we've got a lot of people in the audience today and a lot of them
obviously do we want to let the audience kind of sway us because i like to look i we can go wherever
you want right um just i'm not cutting my dick off i'm just telling you right now man yeah i know
you were talking to me before the show about making that happen on yeah yeah yeah yeah we're trying to
try to plan out something but that's yeah we're gonna start on only fans if that ever like if you
get a certain funding exactly here's the question you could you could ask some uh peter singer you know
how he has that book a life you can save do what you know have you have you heard about his book
a life you can save so it's the concept of like you walk past like someone drowning and like
but like to save them like this child drowning you you would have to risk your life right is it like
morally are you morally obligated to do so and it's like well no you're not like it's probably
morally virtuous but you're not obliged what if it's something you're only going to ruin your like
fish doll a pair of shoes and it's like well then you're probably morally obliged to save this
this this child and then it's like well you can save a child if you if you give 50
charity blah blah like that that's the whole idea so um and he's a utilitarian i'm pretty sure when
he comes to his ethics so the question would be that he asked peter singer is how much money
would we need to get on only fans um that it would be moral would be morally obliged to cut
our dicks off too in order to get that money to put towards charity i have no
derek has left the show no okay let's get let's get into let's get into some
some um let's use some juicy content but first yeah the most important question and um i shouldn't
do this because this is taking a soft drink again but are you who are you voting are you voting for
ye eating for kanya in 2024 that's the most important question how the hell did you know man i mean
isn't it crazy it's crazy right it is world we live in where kanya west is asking donald trump to be
his vice president that dude that whole thing recently i'm just like you know if it's not one
thing with the with the liver king right coming out as a steroid juice and guy when we already knew
he was always so surprised yeah yeah this is so shocking this guy looks like a modern day
hercules but he's not on steroids always on steroids what to what kanya went off the deep end
and this is sad because i work in mental health with helping not like professionally but
with the addiction side of my life i don't even need to get a doctor to recognize there's
some stuff going on and people are giving this guy a platform instead of trying to get him help
like that he really needs and i understand that you can't make people do stuff but i really think
that they're just kind of taking advantage of this because they know that he's gonna get views and stuff so
it's a sad state of affairs because who knows what he's saying if in a month or two if he is
medicated where he's like damn i shouldn't settle that like i don't know why i did that you know
yeah but then not only that is it's like if he does get like locked up quote-unquote like
institutionalized to get his like that that plays into all the conspiracies he's been talking
about so it's like a really really dangerous like it's really yeah it's not good it's not if it's
good but it is a similar qanon type it's like in that same vein it really yeah the race realism
kind of like yeah dodgy stuff yeah okay so now we're actually i'm gonna actually swing it right
back bring us back onto actual track and i've got okay questions for you okay so this let's do rapid
fire and then we'll see where we want to go with these all right do i need a yes or no or do i give
a quick give us give us let's let's just go let's if you feel like it needs an explanation
let's go into it but if not we can circle back around okay so your quick position did jesus exist
historically yes okay do you want me to like i'm not well yeah go go into i this is my conclusion
right now um yeah yeah and and i think yes there was a guy um i am like i totally get why people
would say no or think no um i've read on the historicity i've read robert price i've read richard
carrier um and i've read the other side and to me it was very mundane simple things that made
me think okay we have like a bare bones basic monday guy and might people go why would someone
do that with some monday figure here you could almost say as there are gospels that
are being written about this guy that are written by people who've never met jesus who don't really know
jesus they might have heard stories that are passed along about him and they're writing fictional
narratives that may have some really maybe have kernel in history but really it's when you get to paul
and paul talks about him being crucified and born of a woman born of a flesh uh born under the law
born of a woman is a is a hebu idiom or jewish idiom and this was something they found in the
dead sea scrolls about real people who were like of women born right even the gospels mentioned of
women born john the baptist no man is greater than john the baptist which jesus said this so it's like
is jesus saying john the baptist is better than him these are other questions that go down the road but
anyway point is is it was monday and things like okay like romans really crucified so many jews
and it was a common thing that they crucified jews jocephus jewish writer philo jewish writer paul jewish writer
all in the same century right and can almost contemporary philo and paul mentioned crucifixion of a jewish guy
and i don't see any clear text in paul that gives it now this is where mythicist will disagree with me and they go
wow i'm sorry i don't draw that conclusion i beg i beg to differ i think it's more common
the thing like to say this stuff happens on earth you need for me you need the evidence to explicitly
say it happens somewhere else like outer space i'm just like someone's crucified okay that happens
a lot to humans so just to just to explain a little bit because i i got into a um big argument
with godless engineered we're friends now like i love john huge friends but at the time i i posted
something like on twitter about like it's clear to me that mythicists are just mythicists for the fields
and i thought and then we got into like and we he jumped i really came on i came onto this show
and we had an argument and it was great i got put in my place but my understanding of mythicism was
essentially like jesus didn't exist lol like i thought that's what mythicism was no where where
it turns out it's like i didn't realize that there was this whole different cosmology around it where
it's like no no it's like what the bible is describing so for people who don't know who maybe aren't
in this sphere and they're just like what are you talking about um so the stories of jesus were
recorded in the gospels and then in the new testament and there are there are people called
mythicists who believe that essentially those stories are are like almost parodies of what's
happening in the spirit realm is that right it's like a good way to describe it or like um how would
you describe it it's like it's like something's happening so i'll just i'll just tell you what mythicists
yeah yeah yeah the versions were finding mostly in richard carrier's propositions but also i think
there's overlap with him and and uh rubber price on this mythicists are positing that the earliest
christian cult believed that jesus was a pre existent figure it's not just mythicists that
i mean it's in paul's literature so even a historicist or a mythicist both think that he's a
pre existent figure we find this also with alexander the great like some of these figures were
pre existent and they came to earth like almost like they were sent to earth in a way and then they
go back right you see this with romulus uh he goes back you know anyway um he's a pre existent
heavenly figure that they believed according to mythicists the mythicists don't believe this the
mythicists some might there are a few believers that are mythicists that's a different can of worms i'm not
going into because they actually believe in this stuff uh but that's like not the category we're discussing
they believe um well the mythists say that paul and the earliest christians believe jesus was a
celestial figure pre existent angel in heaven he was a celestial figure in heaven he comes down
is made or manufactured flesh of a woman or really the idea is that he is a mortal he is
now a person a real person in the mind of paul and other people in heaven he is attacked
and crucified by demons in heaven below the moon he is crucified below the moon in heaven
he is buried in heaven below the moon he resurrects from the dead in heaven up there in heaven
right and then ascends back up through the seven layers if you will or do all the layers of heaven
to the highest immortality form where god dwells and such and ascends back up and they believe
that he never actually came to earth like here on earth whereas i just go the step further of
saying like no i think the guy was here on earth um and he actually got crucified by real people
that are romans and if paul's talk about the arkans here which he believes that these are actual demons
and spirits and gods or daemons whatever you want to say i say these are humans controlled by these daemons
it's not like paul blames the humans only he says he says we do not wrestle against flesh and blood
but principalities and powers and rulers etc so paul like i and what convinced me was elaine pagels
on the origins of satan book she points out that in early christian literature i've got that back there yeah
christians called each other children of satan now does that mean that they were literally
descended spawn seed literally of satan or that they were christians called themselves christians called
other christians you know like today you're not a true christian you don't have the right gospel
they're part of the satan's camp right like even the book of revelation implies when he's right to the
seven churches in asia you know like some of these churches he's condemning or rebuking and they're
kind of practicing satanic things like the prophet of baelum whatever the point is is i'm not taking this
it's all demonic and it's all spiritual uh i think paul has the world around him is ruled by invisible
he doesn't think non materialistic things like we think invisible means doesn't exist
they think they have material in some way but that these demons are controlling humans satan can enter people
i mean like you see judas right satan enters judas judas ends up going to betray in christ the point is
paul i'm convinced is writing in a sense kind of encode he can't go those damn romans here's a letter
to the romans those damn romans he's gonna get killed or this is not gonna continue so he's not
gonna explicitly say hey these are the people this is my my my perception um so i'm convinced that this
he actually comes to earth whereas myth is to say this all happens only in heaven and um this gets into
the question dualism is on earth things happening on earth also being what they claim that they're
happening in heaven is there some sense that you know there's like a mirror image of what's happening
here on earth happening in heaven i'd say that model would still work with historicity so well
that's the thing i actually reached out to john uh godless engineer i asked him i was like what is the
you know what's the like some good evidence and he will not good evidence but like so why do you
think this um because he's a strong mythist obviously right he said personally i think that
jesus is the result of a first century jews creating a uh hellenistic mystery cult using
pre-existing ideas in Judaism christianity has all the classic marketers of a mystery cult
so a few things he said like jesus figure um is highly mythologized um with the other
with other historical with little historical evidence polio is our only independent source
so they reject the gospels um as historical some people cite q apparently um which you might
we might have to explain that but um but it's hypothetical and major ideas around jesus's existence
in Judaism which clouds the historical account so he's saying that like because there's these like
because in the gospels there's these things that are clearly written in from the old testament
to make it fit so for example the classic that barterman talks about a lot is you know
how many times did the the um the chicken crow or the rooster crow and it's like three you know
there's there's a book that that said it crowed six times because in one gospel it says it crowed
three times on one day and then another gospel says it crowed three times another day and then
the reason was is because one was trying to fit it in with the old testament scriptures
and so it's like the question is is when did the chicken crow right not super relevant
but it is actually relevant right so um so what do you think about some of those points
especially like can you maybe talk about q what is q oh it's a hypothetical source material for
where they think that some of the gospels get their ideas from but q or no q um and really it's
what also q i mean depending on who you're asking this because the q might be different like
denis mcdonald might even grant that mark might know q some scholars try to posit q into the picture
because there's there's common material between matthew and luke that isn't in mark and like where
did they get this material and by the way i think i am not able to say certainly or i'm not
going to hinge any proposition i make off of q but when i look into it it look at it like this if the
modus operandi of luke and matthew is to copy mark they're copying mark right and you notice there's
common material between matthew and luke that isn't mark and like there's identical material there
or at least it seems like they're overlapping if the modus operandi of luke and matthew is to copy
a book called mark or we're just calling it that for the sake of convenience um then why wouldn't
the modus operandi also be to copy any other source that might be where they're getting this other
information from so it's like if they're already doing a practice of something i don't see any reason
why they're not all also doing it to some other source we just don't have um but even then here's
let's scratch that because the synoptics are all relying on mark and mark seems to be aware paul the real
question we should have is um and it should be an open thing intensive we shouldn't be dogmatic and i also
don't think we should be closed off to this idea and acting like paul is the only source of anything we
have of early christianity that is reliable in any way shape or form to give us the notion that people
know of a jesus tradition because i would say even though the gospels are extremely highly historical
fiction um i would say that you know even marks getting stuff somewhere other than just paul i wouldn't
imagine that well everything's just paul and we have to rely only on paul as if that's the only place
i can't prove like there's no evidence here if you're trying to be a scientist in a lab i have no
chemicals like important to attest to be like hey here you go like no that doesn't work i would say in paul alone
combining it with what we learn from these other sources and stuff
to me it makes perfect sense that this guy gets mythologized and yes i do think also the mystery
religion stuff is paul talks in mystery language so i'm a historicist who thinks everything he's pretty
much saying here i can go i can get in on and even with the gospels inventing him in a way they're
creating him they're they're making him more than what he is if that makes sense and if you go and read
like i've been bringing this up a lot lately but if you go read sutonius lives of the caesars and you
read the story of augustus from his portents of his birth to what he did they're like they're taking
stuff from alexander the great they're taking stuff from julia caesar there's there's earlier stuff that
they're kind of tacking into the narrative about augustus and you go well you know this augustus figure
has far more data and we know he existed there's good reason high confidence to say caesar augustus the
first emperor of rome yeah this guy existed we have a lot of reasons a lot of evidence that we don't
have for christianity but looking at it literarily i'm not convinced just by reading literarily that
we should draw the conclusion jesus is a completely fictional figure in the minds that they think are real
of paul and the early christians in outer space to me it would i'd be a mythosist to put it point blank
david if if it was clearly written in paul that jesus was crucified under the moon in heaven not on earth
see mythosists needed to say on earth in order to be convinced that this is somehow here and that would
make them more like oh historical figure they would they'd be more convinced if it happened and it says
paul says this happened on earth like here for me i don't need that because everything in human
existence typically happens here on earth if the evidence said it happened in heaven i'd be convinced of
mythosism you haven't heard of the celestial julius caesar or um or i'm just kidding no sorry yeah no but but i
definitely know that they go to heaven they they get taken and so they end up ascending and what's funny
to me is like while the gospels are highly fictional they literally right out the back put jesus on earth so
there has to be a conspiracy involved between paul and the gospel of mark which is using paul according to mythosist
and they believe this text portrays him on earth being crucified so if he's using paul and this mark
guy and he's like hey all right we're gonna have him crucified on earth haven't you read paul dude he says he's
in heaven i thought mythosist day why is mark not placing him in heaven being crucified instead he's
crucified by romans which was this apparenday of the first century romans crucified jews so it's like
almost for me i know it's not this super complex oh my god you're blowing my mind it's really
akam's razor and less ad hoc to me to just go where do the simple question back up from the new testament
back up from mythosism back up from historicism how common was it that jews were crucified on earth
first century and then ask the question how common was it that jews were crucified in outer space
this is a simple question that led me down a path that made me go oh snap
how do i reconcile the arkans that paul talks about and i looked at elaine pagels you have mythosists who
say they're full on demons and never mortals never human like as if humans aren't even involved
it's these celestial demons in outer space and then you have the other side that
historicist who kind of want to go the opposite direction to say these arkans these rulers are all human and only human
because arkan and greek the the term for the ruler is simply a term that is well known in the greek
roman world to mean a human ruler someone who's in charge a political figure someone who's in control
and i said hold on maybe both of them are right and it's not either or the demons paul believes in the
supernatural we call it today world where this world the air is full of gods and you know all the stuff
yeah so the humans that are obviously kind of doing the things they're doing are really controlled
by the powers that be if that makes sense that's what i take that that that's very interesting
um i i'm to be honest i'm i haven't like i've i've read half of rich carry's book i've talked to john
i've i've tried to wrap my head around both sides of it i'm not i'm not i i i learned from all of them
just so you know that's we can't i don't think we should shut our minds off no of course not and that's
something that i learned because i because like i said i thought it was just um mythosists like jesus
lol or like sky daddy i thought it was like a cringy atheist thing like that um yeah so i see everyone's
questions everyone um we we will get to them um hopefully but i do want to read out james's question
because it's kind of related which um which experts should uh should james ask about when
let me just pop it up um when the jews or christians change from thinking the sky was a solid dome
holding back the vast ocean to thinking out of space was the thing so so when did flat earth and the
cosmology of the bible kind of change do you know i don't know and i don't know what uh scholar to ask that
i do know that i have done some episodes with this weirdo in the chat named digital hamer abbey
this is such a strange guy i don't tell him it is he's very he's very strange i mean he has this
book that i can't stop reading because he's such a weirdo and it's only on my desk literally
right here next to my computer it's he's so weird i have to read it he is weird he's gonna roast us
in the uh just just watching he's he'll come in he always does this just watch but he's i've got both
his books handbook to the old testament handbook to the new test uh old testament one and two
and the slavery indoors the old testament fascinating man um yeah fascinating weirdo call it yeah because
you know yeah because like i read it because to me it's like comedy it's like i'm laughing at it
because like your scholarship is just dude nobody writes so simple and clear in fact i always underestimate
dr josh sometimes i'll be like all right i'm off to another scholar because i'm doing so much of that
and then i read his work or elicit on audible again and i'm like bro what the hell what this is
so good um but he's so weird remember that don't ever forget that i love i love i love josh and
negan they're both amazing but what they are something that i don't know if maybe you can tell
me dr josh if um if you probably don't so i i don't think josh appreciate these jokes but for a while
i was going on to all of josh's posts about on twitter um but he'd say like some complicated
argument and then i'm like and i'm like hey just talk to my christian friend they said you're wrong
so i'm sorry bud i'm all like uh you gotta go get your uh you know my johavist witness friends
said that actually jesus christ fard on the stake um sorry i'm sorry i didn't inform you and my
joha that he wasn't liking the the post so i'm guessing my jokes went landing but um i thought
they were funny i laughed to myself and i'll tell my wife and she looked me like that's not funny
sorry bud yeah he's got like like a list of degrees and i call him um i think what i call him
something really stupid like daddy assault daddy a seriology or something like just like he's the
expert in that field uh and he doesn't like it um he talks about this cosmology question though
in terms of he obviously knows that the heber bible teaches us he understands there might be
some reason to think and i don't know this because we talked about this briefly when we were jabbing
back at um who's the guy that mike mike uh i can't think of his name you know the christian pastor
lakona no no no no i actually like lakona even though i think you know he draws his confusions
he's one of the only christian people who emailed me back when i yeah i like him i actually
like mike um he's i think he's trying and i really do i gotta give him some effort for trying
within that bubble that he's in um mike's winger yep winger someone brought up none of us you
deserve 100 points in heaven um yeah so so we talked with that and we wondered if
like the new testament still carries over this cosmology i know that in rabbinic tradition
they kind of talk about some of this i've heard in passing but as far as an expert that says
clear transition like they start to think outer space is there's no solid dome i don't know when
and i don't know if there's a fine line because maybe certain traditions or certain rabbis are
you know thinking this while other ones might be more into the philosophy of the greeks and seeing
that it's not solid i don't know i don't know hard for me today someone said uh james said relating
to my prior question the same person actually two great questions james uh when did uh the heavens
go from meaning the sky to a golden city related to his prior question when did heavens go from
meaning the sky to a golden city i don't you know how like i don't know the answer well you do you
know everything you just gotta make it up it's i gotta make up okay well if you want me to make it
up what happened in um 342 ad um during a guy named haka shaka makaha he said that uh
see how like you're speaking in tongues is then it was don't but by the way you gotta translate
that if you have the gift by the way last week we i had emily ferro passes waithon and she's not
really big in the atheist space like she doesn't like she doesn't she didn't know who matt delahanti was
just to put but she went through her own deconstruction experience and things like that uh and
she will talk about that she didn't know a lot about me and she will talk about tongues and she said
she would have bought a honda something like she would have bought a honda would have like she made up
some like phrase yeah and i thought she was actually trying to speak in tongues so i start
speaking in tongues as like oh yeah i can speak like in tongues as well and she's like her mind is
like blown and she's like wait so and then she's like so what do you think's happening there and
then i start going on and her her face like you can watch in the view she's like what fucking podcast
i'm on because she thought i was like defending she's like wait and she's like so you don't believe
in god but you still you still find tongues works for you and i was like no i don't think it's real
like what what no i was just what she's amazing it's a great it was a great episode
i don't know that answer i ain't look if i don't know i'm gonna tell you flat out
um because that's something that i've been learning as well too like don't pretend just say
i don't know nobody gets hurt by it in fact you hurt yourself if you're just like i'm not sure
um and that goes back to the question did jesus exist i'm not sure but i am more convinced
more convinced on yeah based on the way i'm approaching this it i can't prove but nobody can you
know so wow so um so that was the very that was a very long quick position and i loved it so
i had to give you that because you know you gotta give no that that's that's it sets a good foundation
so okay here's here's here's the next here's the next uh slither of the
historicity so first you don't know you used to be pretty strong christian right and and now
you're not a christian so um and people want to learn more unless you've changed your mind but
if people want to learn more about your journey the other podcast is amazing um it's still one of
my favorite but next question was jesus crucified yeah like i don't know why that question would
be asked honestly the only reason i would say is it's coupled into the previous question of did jesus
exist yeah it's the like it's like the next it's like if he did exist because a lot of some people
will say that jesus did exist but he'd look nothing like the jesus we account we have he might have
been like a teaching a teacher or a philosopher and then we met up these stories about him being
crucified but this is the thing even mythosist i mean if you get down to their position they would
say no it's a figment of the imagination of the early christians that he wasn't really crucified they
believed he was crucified but if you grant the mythosist proposition they believe that paul believed
that jesus really was crucified so the earliest christians believed that jesus was literally
crucified they just say it was up there rather than on earth yeah and so i would say it happened on
earth and i don't see any reason to think that a jew wasn't crucified when we have
tremendous amount of evidence to suggest as far as literature goes and then we even have
ankle bones with literally like jewish asuaries where the bone boxes and there's a special period in
time where jews buried themselves like that awaiting the resurrection very apocalyptic time in history
they thought the resurrection in the end was going to happen soon like we found bones with real nails
in the ankle bone they were crucified i don't see any reason why that doesn't make more sense and have
more weight in this argument and now that i'm not a mythosist i see that it's kind of like when you
look back and you go how come that doesn't cause people to go over this is my opinion but okay that's
great i'm gonna add another i'm gonna add a question in between the question just then and the
one i was gonna ask was there an empty tomb i think that's legend i can't say with certainty
wait wait the empty tomb or the resurrection because the next one is did jesus rise from the dead but
i'm going back to was there an empty tomb i think the empty tomb narratives that we find in the
gospels are legend i believe that paul when he says that jesus resurrected right from the dead
this is implying he's not dead anymore some way shape or form different scholars tackle this differently
so james taber doesn't think the flesh matters at all in this in fact james taber says the body could
have been right there in the cave and they would have still believed he rose from the dead not a literal physical
other scholars think no um this is the it's a common trope that if people die and then they just
believe that they ascended and went off in heaven i'll give you a few things too that i think is interesting
acts in act 17 this is not paul this is the author whoever luke acts is writing much later i say early
second century i'm with shelly matthews richard pervo um steve mason many other academics i think
the right that this is late because luke acts knows jocephus in my opinion but i'm giving you this to say
in act 17 paul is creating this gospel narrative he's kind of a socrates paul in his real letter says
he has a speech impediment he's not good at speaking but in act 17 they fictionalize paul and paul's like
ladies and gentlemen jesus like they make up this narrative but in it there's something that kind of cues you in
on something i think is interesting about the author and he says that these um what was the name of
the group they believe that zeus was buried but zeus's body isn't in there and that he is alive forever so
there's like i don't know if it's the name of the what the name of the group was the cretins liars cretins you
find this also in a pastoral pistol later that zeus was buried and dead he analogizes zeus and his burial
which most of the greeks would say no he's alive forever he's he's a high god he's never gonna die
uh or can't stay dead if there's a narrative out there that might have existed that he died he can't stay dead
so they mythologize and say that tune you say he's buried in he's not buried there and you wonder
why they're doing that when he's talking about jesus and comparing it to the resurrection
so i think it's a legend and it's a common trope in the Mediterranean that if a body is missing
that the god he has become a god the whole reason really yeah the whole reason the body isn't there
by the way my mythosus friends would 100% agree with me on this like we all and this is
it's not like i don't even know i'm bringing that up because of the previous questions but my point
is like we all recognize like this is doing damage control like doing damage to like like hey man
mythosus mythosus are also here like we'll also love you like yeah well look i do damage control
because there's so much tribalism and people take it it's like why are you why are we being so
anim like the animosity is tense why it's legend no it's because of people it's because of people like me who
like literally make stupid comments on like who don't know enough enough about it but like thank
thank like goddess engineer was so good that he brought me on he set me straight like we had
a little it was a it was a bit of a fiery back and forth but it would be ended as friends it was good
but i like i like goddess engineer because you can have a conversation and stuff but yeah it's that it's that
i mean it's just it's like a typical it's like the shitting on shitting on mythosus mythosus are
like the vegans of the um of the um scotly space i guess you know what i mean like everyone likes to
like rip on them and it's like yeah yeah but i mean not rip on vegans either i'm it's a back and forth
thing where like both sides are just doing this to each other i think the simply answer is
i don't think there was an empty tomb but this is what i do right so what i do is i go but if there
was a body and the body went missing how and why and where and what that's what i get into so while
i think right it's for me i'm lost in the detail like i'll read a scholar serious academic one of
their answers is and i can't remember the name of the guy he said well the disciples stole the body
and you go well hold on the gospels literally tell you that by the way the accusers the jews jewish people
say your disciples stole the body this is in the gospels they tell you the answer this one real
serious scholar says they tell you the answer and he goes to back up this claim even though i don't
follow his conclusions he backs up the claim by saying these guys were fishermen in galilee on the
lake of tiberius which then got monopolized by the emperor tax collectors are collecting tax for every
fish they bring out of that damn lake they don't want to go back in labor for the rest of their life
they're getting paid by these christ following little house churches to feed them and giving the money
they're not going to want to go back to this construction work for the rest of their life kind
of thing when they're getting fed and and taken care of by just preaching a message so they would they
would lie by stealing the body now i don't draw it but to me i'm giving you analogy in detail here
if i ended up on your couch tomorrow i told this on james apperson show which he's on in the chat
and um spoke to jay a buddy of mine the other night if i appeared on your couch in 24 hours
and i was dead you can't ask me questions i'm using an analogy the first thing you're probably
going to think is derrick got a flight how did he get here he flew here how did he get my address
he probably found it online or something or talked to one of my friends or yeah common sense would
lead you to this conclusion the last thing you would think is i teleported yeah that i have a portal
in my my like in this office that i could get to you the last thing christians want you to believe
the last thing is the most probable that he rose from the dead because people believed it as if people
aren't superstitious or aren't like wishing and hoping this stuff is true yeah and the and yeah that
i'm i'm with you with that i i want to um i want to read a little section of the bible again
forgive me um but this this this is what really stood out to me is um when i was doing my video on
the bible like the other new testament's historical i was really i found out mark was the earliest
gospel right mark was written what is it 35 years after jesus died or like 40 years or something
let's just say we don't know 35 40 years it's not i would just say after the war in 70 at least
okay cool yeah so it's at least 35 years right so this is the earliest gospel right so so everyone
i want you to pitch yourself like so you this is 30 years after like this is the time when you know
the life expectancy was about 35 years anyway um you 30 35 years ago there's these stories and
someone finally decides to write down an account and they want to tell the whole story they leave
out the virgin birth they leave out like that whole part of the story and this is how they end
right so jesus died on the cross he's been buried in a tomb and says this when the Sabbath was over
mary magdalene mary mother of james and salami brought spices so they might um anoint jesus body
very early the first day of the week just after sunrise they were on their way to the tomb and
they asked each other who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb but when they looked
up they saw that the stone was um which was very large had been rolled away as they entered the tomb
they saw a young man dressed in white robes sitting on the right side and they were alarmed don't
be alarmed he said you were looking for jesus the Nazarene he who was crucified he has risen
he is not here see this place where they laid him um but go tell your disciples um tell the
disciples and peter he is going ahead um of you into galilee there you will see him just as i told you
trembling with bewilderment the women went out and fled from the tomb they said nothing to anyone
because they were afraid and that's the original ending of mark it has nothing about the
jesus encountered with the resurrection disciples it has nothing that's it it doesn't have the part
where jesus levitates up into the crowd that's the original ending of mark and you can look
in any bible it will say well most bibles will say the most reliable early manuscripts and other
entry witnesses do not have mark 16 9 to 20 so it's like it's like wait like if you're if you're
going to be talking about like the most basic like some of the most basic stuff you're not going
to mention that jesus levitated into the clouds not going to mention that jesus like showed himself to
500 people now i know some people i think uh inspiring philosophy says this he says that
there was that there was an original ending and we've lost that original ending what are you
no no i'm with delcey allison jr and he's a christian says no i'm with many many scholars
recognize that mark ended in this spot i know there's a case people can make because well it
is so shocking you don't need to tack on an ending to recognize what it's trying to tell you
he's not here anymore he's a god that's the whole point of him not being in the tomb
he's a god now romulus gets taken and they're like what the hell happened and it ends up being
later he appears to one of his faithful followers and shows up and is like hey it's me go and tell the
people of rome blah blah blah like he appears to him later he disappears and they're like what
happened and there's rumors that he got killed by the senate which what happened to julie cesar you wonder
if that happened after julie's really was killed i don't know um or that he's completely gone and that
he was taken by the gods because they couldn't he couldn't be here anymore god the gods had to take him
um he's gone he became a god this is clearly the fictional narrative of mark he became a god and even
though you don't have the story of him ascending right you have more of a detailed narrative in acts where he ascends
that trope is a trope romulus ascends in a cloud jesus ascends in a cloud like it's just uh
it's fun writing and people who are taking this stuff so serious like i did for 15 years
like of my life as a youth like just we're missing the reality of the bigger world at large
and we were downplaying other figures and not really considering because i just didn't know them as a christian
i think if i'd have known what i know now sooner about all these other gods and figures if i didn't have
this is psychoanalyzing forgive me in advance i'm cool with michael jones i really am we get along
um oh yeah he's yeah yeah but like i don't know if he would or could right now for reasons of supporting
his house or what he does through his channel if he could go the full way of you know letting go or
something so i don't know if he's holding on because these he knows he sees these comparative figures
um it just seems like special pleading in double standards when you have to say well ah romulus didn't
really do that and this stuff preceded christianity like you have all these fake tropes that you wouldn't
say actually are true and you wouldn't say they actually happen but then you get to jesus to say it really did
but then after jesus comes well well let's find a way to say that didn't happen either or that copied us christians
which is the true thing and that's the fake stuff i mean like where do we draw the line and i'm trying to
yeah i had um when i had michael jones on um and he's been on twice now and the second time
we discussed the problem of evil and it was fantastic um i introduced him by saying
you know i love you know i love michael not because i think he's right but
better because i think he's the least wrong in the group of like apologetics like i think i
don't know any apologists who i think is more wrong uh less wrong i think he's the least wrong
like i think it was a friendly it was a friendly bandit because like he's
i consider him a friend and you know we always talk all the time but but um but yeah like he's
definitely he's he's more honest than the average like apologist especially like the ken hams and
he's playing with the same toys that the series academics i have on my channel like dr josh and
stuff are doing i just think sometimes he's trying to find the most scholarly on the position of
the christian worldview and then like going there like let's find michael hyzer what's michael hyzer
say let's go with him john walton let's find what john walton says and let's go with him he's
still a christian so somehow can i get as scholarly as possible and still remain in this bubble of my
particular position and so i think and that's fine i commend him for that you know yeah i actually
and that's what i tell people is i is i say to people um not to make this an inspiring philosophy
moment like our but but i always tell people like my my understanding of what michael does is he goes
like okay like i have this faith i want to try and fit it into like the scholar scholarly resources
where a lot of apologists do this tap dance of like no i'm a christian because all the evidence of
but it's like no you're not you didn't start you didn't look you didn't sit down and analyze the
evidence of like every religion go well christianity has moved you had like emotional reasons for why
you were a christian and then you're like oh no this doesn't work with evolution this doesn't work
with all these other things let me find reasons to like make my brain okay with all that stuff like
yeah no one no one arrives at christianity because of apologetics i've never met a christian apologist
going with what you just said who before they were ever a christian or an apologist went and examined
all of these cases of dying and ascending and rising and miracle workers and stuff like that
comparative mythology and things and then arrived and went you know after examining all of these things
i think the most plausible and the realistic one is this one here never i've always found
that a christian apologist once they have been seeded into the faith they then are going out of their
way to find evidence or try to make their view right and they then they're willing to go oh i can read
romulan i can read about this i can read about that and somehow factor that in yeah so that my world
view is still right you see what i'm saying it's like it's like post talk instead of like following
the evidence where it leads yeah um this actually leads us into something i do want to talk about
but man we uh like it's very easy to talk to you and we've been chatting for over an hour now but
um next year for yeah no this it's really really enjoyable but um uh so
you would obviously know about um satra saibaba right um i haven't really started i know of
him but i don't i haven't really studied absolutely definitely a con man like he does like a lot of
hand tricks and people are like oh he's spawning gold in his hand like gold necklaces and he's
like doing like stuff and then giving necklaces to ladies and stuff but when he died i think there
was like a people went into his compound they found like hundreds of like gold watches like with
like from boxes and stuff but there are people a lot of people who say that he did like legitimate
miracles and he had like there are testimonies that you can read online of him raising people
from the dead three years after the the like the body is smelling like i'm sorry three days
okay my gosh three days um i always misspeak i apologize oh you're fine the so i was going
to read out the whole like part of the story but for the sake of time essentially someone called um
uh radha krita krishna died and they were there for like like three days and they were
saying let's let's bring him here's first of all satra saibaba was an indian guru and this was in
the 50s so 1956 and um i'll just read the last part uh gently ba baba asked the tearful woman
and and the sorrowful son-in-law to leave the room so this is a testimony that's written online
as they left uh he closed the door behind them uh they did not know and no one knew what happened
in the room where there was only the baba and the dead man so this dead man been dead for
three days after a few minutes baba opened the door and beckoned the the waiting ones in
there on the bed um raka uh raka radha krishna i'm just let's see i was looking at them and
smiling amazingly the stiffness of his death had vanished and his natural color was returning
baba went out stroked the patient's head and said to him talked to them they're worried um why worried
why um asked sorry worried and perplex right krishna said why are you worried i'm right here uh
swami turned to his wife um i've given you your husband back he said now go get him a hot drink
so that's like a testimony in the 50s um now there are a lot of people who follow like 500
thousand people went to his burial and saibaba predicted his death so this is this is where it
gets interesting this is where i feel like there's some analogies right so you have 500 000 people who
went to his burial a lot of them believing these stories of resurrection and this wasn't the only
resurrection account that he had by the way but um and like i said i think he's a con like at least a
little bit right um but but still there's people who believe this 500 000 people attended his burial
saibaba predicted that he would die at the age of 96 and would remain healthy until then
but after he died some um but he died at the age of 84 but after he died some devotees and see if you
can see a parallel here suggested that he was referring to many to different luni years as counted
by to luigi speaking hindus rather than solely years and using indian way of accounting for age which
counts for years to come as part of a person's life other devotees have spoken of the anticipated
resurrection reincarnation or awakening so they're reinterpreting the ideas of like well you know
and you can see this happen with one of my favorite subjects um and inspiring philosophy is doing a video on
this is why hasn't jesus returned yet because he told he's told his disciples i'm i'm coming back
people standing here will not taste death until you see if it's on the main returning so right right
and he's going to do a video uh inspiring philosophy is going to do a video or he's arguing that it didn't
fail i'm like so curious or that jesus didn't really predict that it was going to happen immediately
and he and he said del see allison jr um may have also switched his position on this i don't know
because i'm in direct contact with del and del's written many books where jesus failed and i mean i've
got him on my back shelf here so i'm curious what do you mean failed he's a failed apocalyptic
prophet like he made predictions that didn't happen um it's interesting what you just said i definitely
see a pattern in jewish thought yeah he revival i mean like reinterpreting with danuel the calculating
the 490 years all that uh i see it with christianity right out the gate already trying to understand
like what's this mean and then second peter three trying to change time a thousand years is like a day so
maybe we don't really know what the hell this means and therefore you know it didn't fail because jesus
can't be wrong you know so yeah but that's the thing and to me so for my for me personally i think
that what happens is people have like people have experiences i don't know what these experiences are
and people have like teachers profound teachers um philosophers religious leaders who they respect
a lot and they go through some wild stuff and then they have these like whole i mean the early church
sold all their belongings right like they really believe what they're what they're believing so it's
like you can see after 30 lifetimes 30 40 50 60 years after the fact people are people are writing
these stories and trying to make sense of this movement and you can so see how
an empty tomb in mark turns into oh well actually jesus came back and then the bodies
raised from the dead and you know and the zombies walking through all through jerusalem and i know
michael kona who's a christian said that didn't happen and lost his job because of that so
yeah interesting and but yeah the thing the thing with the jesus returning thing
is and this is what i said to i i said um michael and like i said we're friends i said to him
on twitter i said you better make it good or i'm coming for you and he said what if it makes you
cry um i was like i'll be i said hashtag saved um so uh but the thing is like jesus has a few
things he says surely i tell you the truth this generation will by no means pass until all these
things take place the son of man returning on the clouds another part it says the son of man will
come in great glory with his father and his angels assuredly i say that people standing here shall not
taste death until the son of man coming in his kingdom and like i've heard christians like interpret
this to be like well there was a second death in heaven like a spiritual death and there's like
and like all these like post hoc rationalizations or or my favorite this is always my favorite
you know what derrick we can ask him when we meet him you know yeah yeah i mean you're
you're hitting the nail on the head i have nothing else to add to what you're saying on this because
this is it's the most obvious to me yeah okay okay well um so we've done the whole we've pretty
much done just the quick positions which was supposed to be like five minutes and we're almost
at the end of the podcast so i think what we'll do is um we'll let's let's move into some q and a
and i'll just throw some of these like other ideas i have because it's been this has been a
really enjoyable conversation and thank you everyone for coming out to the last episode of
deep drinks for 2022 this has been exciting year and next year is going to be even better
and we're going to have some some some cool things happening soon and obviously you can see down here
once we get to a thousand subscribers we're doing a charity stream because i can mean like
i can monetize the channel thanks derrick it means we can do we can monetize the channel which
means that you know like um i can get better guests on and i can do some um some stuff and you
know like we're we're currently spending a lot of money on like you just see a booze captain
because each guest wants a different bottle of alcohol and it's just like this huge thing and
the other day i was making like cocktails by myself and i sent a photo to thomas holy cool aid
westbrook and he said oh because i made his drink which is essentially a long island ice tea
did not recover good anyway everyone subscribe if you like this content but more importantly
than to subscribe to deep drinks make sure you go subscribe to miss fish and podcast this like us
guys if you this is not like it's like video after video after video after video of like
these big questions and like really into the weeds like some of the stuff that you talk about
it's just like like i've just gone i've scrolled down well like 20 videos and we're only like a month
ago like you put out how many videos a month a week do you put out like i mean i pretty much post
almost every day that's it's crazy and these are like two like some of them are like 20 minute
videos some of them are like two hour videos it's it's really cool and of course also make sure you
if you like what derrick's doing you go patreon and people can go get like direct questions from
you they can talk directly to you and they can get a bunch of different perks and and also ask
questions to these scholars on your patreon which is awesome and you also have a your courses coming up
yeah mvp courses can you tell us a little bit about that yeah i wanted to take the academics that
i interview all the time have them systematically teach whatever they specialize in a particular course
and like you were taking a college course at yale or harvard or oxford or whatever might be
princeton a lot of these scholars actually taught or are still teaching at some of these colleges
and um it'll be an online course where anyone from the convenience of their home for an affordable
rate can literally take the course and they have the course for a lifetime so they can have
their whole families come over or friends whoever's into this stuff and be able to like watch it and
whatnot and learn because i want to take this stuff that's in the ivory towers of academia
and not just in books so many scholars publish try to make more popular books and stuff but we're
going toward mp4 as well so it's not like this is just an online college class where you might
hear a lecture these are high quality edited 4k videos where we're giving you like what you would
get if you went to one of these massive great colleges for a good price and right now i've already
done recordings with im david litwa richard carrier i've done uh james tabor and delcy allison
jr which i've mentioned earlier about the apocalyptic jesus he does one on the quest for the historical
jesus i've got uh this january coming up denis mcdonald's coming up kip davis is coming up to
stay here to record i mean everyone's coming here and they stay here and we record and do the courses
and i'm planning on doing this with many many academics it helps the scholars especially making
an income you know doing this and it'll be residual so anytime anyone ever purchases the course
you're helping that scholar they get a commission effort every cell but also it makes it's affordable
right so and it's really a lot of work goes into making each course with the editing and stuff so that's
that's not for me yeah and and for my my christian friends like when i was a christian i i would be
terrified to watch a channel like yours because you're not a christian right and so like i would think
that you'll probably i don't know have some demons or something or you or whatever but what i love
about your channel and what i try and do with this channel um like i i bring christians on i bring
people of all different religions belief systems on and i'm trying to have good conversations sometimes
there are episodes where i'm like making fun of christianity or not christianity but like the bible
or certain things right like if i find it immoral um but in general i try to make this an open inclusive
inclusive for everyone right and that's what i love about your your content is you do the same
thing but more from more an academic standpoint um my channel is a little different than i try to
have like just deep conversations about things that aren't uh like not not academic like i don't
have as many scholars and stuff on um that's why you come on you you come on to teach us the
academics and everything that you know but what i love about yours is it's it's not you're not like
preaching a certain narrative you'll have like you'll poke questions at the the guests and ask them
what they think about certain big topics so that's what i really appreciate about it i try to be kind
of a huge fan you know to not get too much in the way you know of the conclusions but i openly
tell people my bias so it is what it is yeah and that's good um so guys um if you got any questions
feel free to shoot me in the chat i'll try and go through and ask um some of the questions that
i've missed um but i've got a few questions i want to ask first um and these some of these they maybe
you can just give me like very give give me sentence responses to these because um yep these uh and
these uh if people want to hear more about these these are literally answered in some of your most
recent videos so are there other virgin births besides jesus yes and i know it's already
i mean disagrees but yeah oh okay all right and i take his student his student proves otherwise
but go ahead okay all right uh god had a wife question mark well you know come on man you already
know the answer to that one right i mean oh she's i i i i love francesca staff before like
i've i've i've loved it before that book came out i was watching interviews and like yeah
she's sassy that's why and she knows her ship she's an expert um what are any books uh that you
that you think should be are there any books that you think should be in the canon
that aren't and are there any books that you think shouldn't be in the canon
and when i say canon for those who don't know it's like when the bible was canonized
300 years after the writings uh no i mean maybe well i think the canon isn't big enough
sure they should include all of this literature i mean because what what the problem with having
a canon and i'll shut up like you want to short succinct is christians don't read wide enough
and they don't get the implications i think often and i'm not speaking for every christian
there are some that are more liberal and progressive in their approach but it's like
read wider like i don't think we should shrink i think we should take all of the literature
and understand what is this what is the phenomena here um not systematically harmonized though so
ascension of azea or looking at um inak one inak things lots of stuff lots of stuff so anyway yeah
so um great great answer uh i want to quickly swing back to the words topic i want to talk about
miracles so when i was a christian i believed in miracles i believe that um i would tell people
i saw miracles but when i think back to it now i'm like was that really a miracle was so what i did
is i i i tweeted out to my 450 twitter followers and i said um serious question for christ hashtag
christians what is the greatest miracle or act of god that you have personally witnessed um and i'll
be discussing miracles with derrick tomorrow um and i and i added inspiring philosophy captain
christianity apologetic student five and a few other um apologists uh and i got no reply from anyone
none not a single like anybody at all no one i haven't even a response at all not even response
but not only that i then went on instagram uh and uh facebook which has a lot of my old church
friends who you know swear by this stuff and i asked and i posted it and a hundred people saw it
and no one went to the anonymous miracle form to just tell me their testimony it's literally
literally i was just opening the floor for us to talk so well actually this is what we got
i uploaded a cricket audio file but we literally got nothing and i was actually shocked
for that i was like wow like this is the this is a chance for christians like my christian friends
and stuff to to to say like this is like this happened to me this is the miracle happened i know
this was an act of god like and i'm sure i've heard stories of like people and i was looking
you know videos of people getting out of wheelchairs and stuff um it is a rather christian
a christian like faith healings seem to be a christian centric thing like a lot of other
religions don't necessarily have physical healings like faith healers but i want to get your
perspective what do you think about faith healing well i think it's a psychological thing mostly
placebo and the environment and i don't think that they're literally doing any miracles i don't
believe and if you go into look into the miracle accounts and i know people who believe miracles
modern miracles are happening and stuff and they make case they try to find cases where this is
like the case and like once again did i teleport to your to your couch or like did it happen somehow
and honestly we aren't sure but you're drawing your conclusion um there are miracle claims all across
the world not just christianity there are miracles that are healing things like that and in fact before
christianity is celebius there were temples all over the mediterranean world he was a healing god
he supposedly resurrected from the someone from the dead zoos got mad and killed him his father apollo
got angry at zoos zoos resurrected a celebius back from the dead and then of course had him
become a god up there on mount olympus i'm making the point that like a celebius is the original og when it
comes to like being in the mediterranean and doing healings like that you could argue that healings
happened earlier through these prophets like elijah and elisha uh there were miracles or possibly
looking at other figures but if you're like gonna try and look at some contemporaries competition a
celebius would have been the competition in the city in the world i've never i'll have to do some reading on
a celebius oh yeah we still use the symbol you know the serpent symbol as our medicine our medical
ambulances have the serpent this is still something that goes back rooted in the medicine and and of course
the celebius you know plays into some of this stuff but um you see serpents all throughout the ancient
world they they have kind of a divine essence and they're mysterious and stuff and they they shed
their skin which looks like they're immortal because they regenerate it looks like they're brand
new once they shed their skin they're like reborn and that's why you think mythologies like the
the mesopotamian mythologies have snakes stealing the the the plant that gives gilgamesh eternal life or
the plant that gives adam an eve everlasting life and stuff or that you know stealing the
plant in some way plays it's a different narrative but it plays a role in like taking their immortality away
and they end up being mortal and dying so there's all sorts of stuff to look into man but uh
i when it comes to miracles i i really love what daddy hum says um david hum daddy hum uh he says
and i'll say this slowly because it is it is a mouthful no testimony is sufficient to establish a
miracle unless that testimony be of such a kind that it's falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact
which it endeavors to establish we must always decide to favor the lesser miracle always accept the
lesser miracle and i i love it's like it's like what's more miraculous that you flew to australia
got on my couch or that you teleported right so it's like and if i told people if i told you i'm
gonna teleport to your couch and then you actually believe that i teleported because i'm on your couch tomorrow
24 hours later um no you might be a little bit shocked but what if you found out hold on there was
there were flights that did take place here whatever if you examine it and we know so many other
people take flights in the world to get the places in short periods of time this is that prior probability
stuff that like i'm not going to get a calculator out and i'm not going to pretend that i have a way
of factoring in the proper numbers just from basic experience when i talk about prior prior probability
people fly places and get there in convenient amount of time and so it's like which one are you
gonna go with it's the simplest thing is and then if you see other figures who die or who supposedly
walk on water like buda walks on water um you know various figures this one's the one
um dude there's also yeah and it's it's like when you go to kind of like i love what uh
what chris phichan says and god is not great he says he says like if god if jesus can heal a
blind man why not heal blindness why not cure it why not cure it yeah kill blindness pull together
just remove blindness like heal cancer but i don't cure it yeah it seems it seems malicious
or like he says like what's so good about like driving out demons to send them into a flock of pigs so
they jump off a cliff i mean send them into some flowers or something that doesn't have pain receptors
or something you know i mean like don't throw it into like an animal that's sentient i don't know um
so but yeah it's it's it's yeah it to me and and i'm sure you've heard of um the car sagans the dragon
in the garage analogy right have you heard that yes yes every time god becomes unfalsifiable
yeah yeah so so for those who just quickly for those who don't know if i say to derrick derrick
i've got an invisible i've got a dragon in my garage and he's like wow let's go check it out
and we go in there and there's no dragon and i say oh it's actually invisible and then he goes
i'll put i'll put flour on the floor so we can see the footprints oh it actually can't move flour
oh okay well i'll use heat detection actually it's a perfectly temperature eventually like
if you keep and keep looking for this god and like this god or this dragon and you kind of
literally avoids every form of detection eventually that dragon or god becomes uh
becomes exactly the same a universe for that dragon or that god looks exactly the same as
the evidence for a god uh oh my gosh looks exactly the same as a universe with or without
god right so like yeah um so let's uh let's answer some last final questions from people
some um i have a great question about islam and the holy spirit jews and christians
say the holy spirit is part of god and i think mainstream muslims say the holy spirit is gabriel
is this a mistake or difference and what did the um the old muslims think about it i have
not investigated that i honestly couldn't tell you i don't know i mean i'd have to look that up i don't
know that muslims equate gabriel the angel with the holy spirit um but then again maybe they do maybe
this is just a different tradition that they've people been building off of and came up with something
different i don't know that i've never looked at it and seen that so okay awesome uh james
coming in with hot questions again um are you a santa mythicist or a santa hysterist
well saint nick right was a guy um but is santa obviously i don't think santa existed um
so the question is did they mythologize this guy and create what we have today and so yeah i
and is is everything that we're hearing today actually stemmed from the guy this is another kind
of like the complexity of jesus like is everything that's mythologized something that really stems
from the guy no like they are borrowing stuff they or at least when i use the word borrow people
go with plagiarism or this and that there's no copyright on this material this is just in the
world that they live in if someone makes a hip hop song right now would you say he's copying
tupac or he's copying biggie or he's copying him and him yes not necessarily not necessarily
everyone copies biggie in two but no but yeah yeah and it gets it gets pretty uh details like you
can get lost in the weeds okay awesome that's that's a great question um great answer sorry um so
in the last 12 months what if anything have you changed your mind on last 12 months um well
because i'm imagining i'm imagining that i'll ask this again so this will be like if you see those
like billy eilish like one year interviews that happen like every year she asks us i'll ask this every
year so for the next 12 years that when you keep coming on the show on the derrick knows everything
christmas special um we'll ask the same question and we'll see how your beliefs change well i think
there's a couple of things i could say obviously the mythos thing where i've become convinced that
historicism makes more sense um the other thing is i think and it's not necessarily my mind has
completely changed it's just my focus has been more in this area of seeing how i can have common
ground as much as i can with people who are of faith and trying to understand the physical
science behind why people believe the brain things like that um i'm trying to i'm trying to bridge
a gap there where it's not like they're believers and i'm non-believers like we're both experiencing
this world we live in we call it life and instead of doing tribalism all over again like the early
church did to each other or every group says you're not like me and i'm not you know you're demonic
and i'm not we have the right thing i'm trying to find common ground with people who are believers
it's just tough when it when you're dealing with fundamentalism which is what my real
motivation is to try and get people to be non-fundamentalist um i'm sure there's many other
things that i've like started to do and in fact i would say also my views as far as um just becoming
more a people person more liberal in my approach how do you how women have been treated in things
after reading the history the way that the the language the language in the ancient world the patriarchal
language that is built into these structures i've really started realizing oh my goodness like
even the crucifixion we've been talking about this whole episode i've asked saline lily and other
academics who've come on and these are feminist scholars who who see are and are sensitive to the
language they understand that roam was known as the impenetrable why do you think they penetrated
when they crucified they were the ones who penetrated they were not the ones being penetrated
so they it like sex is built into warfare into everything in the ancient world when you think about it the
reason they're crucifying is they're penetrating the people opposing roam and if you look at the
iconography on some of the statues they've had roam is always a man and it's like there's like 30
there were 30 templates in emphasis in one of the temples that were in the first century around the time
the mission was emperor and there were women in every one of them and the women represented the
nations that roam conquered and in one of them you know they'll have a knife to the woman's throat
it's a it's a rape scene and it was actually encouraging wow because roam was dominating and
penetrating nations so yeah when you start to see this you start to realize it affects you
politically it affects you and how you're going to be sensitive to people today and giving voices to voices that
weren't given those voices unless you were a you know the queen or the like super high up someone
a power in elitist you're not going to get heard if you're female and so i'm realizing that i do
appreciate i did actually notice how many because i wrote down like a bunch of like people i recognize from
your channel when i read out that list but i love the diversity that you you have i mean
like you know it's not just a bunch of like dudes yeah like it's like you know you got like i love
like um i think i think i fell in love with elaine pagle when she first came on i was like this she's so
lovely and she has such a good story um yeah oh and another thing i would say that that drives
into the female thing it also drives into race right the whole idea of blacks and whites and stuff
and seeing that in academia like i'm trying to give more voices to people who aren't white guys like me
you know females obviously i'm trying to find people who are not like me and in fact i'm interviewing
another jew soon so i'm trying to be diverse in the approach they won't they won't be voting for kanya but that's for sure
no i don't think so sorry to bring it back to that i shouldn't talk like he doesn't need any more
attention um someone asked this uh on uh in the discord and there is links to the discord if anyone
wants to join we have great conversations over there what time um what limit do you have for those
with ignorant beliefs do you have like a cutoff oh yeah i'm sure i do but like academically like
let's say you had um i mean you're not really in the political space but like yeah let's say someone
want to come on and talk about like a race realism or something i'm yeah i mean i don't want to get into
like as much as i can i try to keep it within the topics i specifically discuss for myth vision
i mean it is an academic thing that doesn't mean i silence my scholars who might jab their views
from time to time in here um but yeah like race realism that that's something completely different
i thought you were talking yeah but i'm just i was just trying to think of yeah racialism was
a thumb but i'm just just thinking of like something disgusting uh but like let's say there was
like the race realism equivalent of like a historian who came on and thought like i don't know
like he was he was making an argument that um i don't know that certain ethnic groups were dirty or
disgusting like there's okay so this is something that i've never told anyone i've interviewed people
didn't go live because i already was wondering especially after my learning experience from past
academics that i've had on my channel right you kind of learn um that i've never published
i've purposely avoided publishing because they said things and i wasn't just gonna edit out edit out
those things they say that i found like really and they weren't really uh phd some of them some of
them were really just popular authors in other countries and i just didn't publish them i'm not
gonna name name but i'm just not yeah they're just never showing up on my channel i've even had
to take down videos and i'm not talking about robert price that's a whole different thing i've taken
down videos because i've put disclaimers up before and the guy was so upset at my disclaimer and
saying i don't agree with many things that this guy specifically espouses he was so upset he's like
just take it down then you don't have to tell me twice yeah you know like yeah that's yeah that's the
thing i i and just for just for everyone who's interested you can go to deepdrinks.com slash disclaimer
and um because i have and this is derrick you know i'm a small youtube channel but derrick spent
he spent hours on the phone to me talking about this stuff because there was a big question of like
how do you how do you do you choose to platforms about ideas so for me deep drinks um deep drinks
isn't a safe space like to me deep drinks is like we explore ideas and uh and i try and label the
the idea the the concepts um the episodes people can skip ones they don't want to like it's not no
wonder what if you if you've got like religious trauma syndrome you probably don't want to watch an
episode but the christian apologies so or like purity culture or something right so i try and but i i i try
and be as open as i can to talk about the most ideas um and try and try and platform them responsibly
not that i've had anyone crazy on but like we are doing some like in the new year uh nuria kahn
who i know you've had on the channel all the humanists who she's amazing um she we're going to be running
potentially running a panel on iran right which is talking about human rights violations and stuff
and i don't you know i don't want to just be shooting on islam or or anything like that in in the
panel but obviously like that could be quite offensive to some muslims because you know we'll
be talking about the religious laws in iran um that you essentially come from the Quran so
it's a fine line of like how do you have these tough conversations without being
kanya you know we're having a dickhead um you kanya that i don't think you can compare i mean it's
it's sorry yeah i can't keep bringing it up yeah no no no but you know being critical is a whole different
thing but i'm like that too so i just um opened up my my bible and i found this that i put up up here
uh i can't see it let me just it's probably gonna focus okay uh yeah there we go okay
unhappy plus jesus equals happy to the power of eternity i wrote that in
wrote that in bible college anyway last question absolutely last question and then we're gonna go
and this is a question i didn't get to ask you last time um but uh i ask every everyone this question
now um i try to what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in
i'd want and uh now i'm gonna sound like jordan peterson for a second here uh oh
it'd take me three days to answer that question the question like like like i want to be on the same page when
you say true like like what does this mean historically true or like because they're all
they're all every one of them from what i understand have legend they're all like using narratives to formulate
their particular issue i guess if you like had to like if you like if let's say you had like this magic box
and this magic box said one of the world's religions is actually accurate it's true it's true and you've
got to guess which one because it's important which one would you choose oh man dude okay which
one like Lawrence would reality the best honestly i i couldn't i don't know if i could answer that question
and be like honest but i guess i would i maybe i'd go back and go with something like that's animism or
some form of pantheism or something like that before i would get lost into some this particular god and
this guy you know because what ends up evolving philosophically speaking we keep it's like kind of
science in a way philosophy keeps advancing to the concepts of god god gets pushed to outside space in time when
there used to be layers in heaven now it's like outside of the existence of this universe is where god dwells
because it's like the dragon in the garage um so you kind of wonder like if and i've said this i'm just
going to say it like this because i can't say any specific right um is nature the divine let me well let me
let me just let me just preface this right so like you don't believe in the bible right so you probably
don't believe in the book of Mormon because that's like a third book on top of that right so it's like so it's
like Mormonism is probably a little more silly than Christianity in your in your mind if you don't accept
the bible you don't accept the third book as well so it's like so you know you're thinking like maybe you
go back to like clay tablets and like clay clay statues and i don't even know about i mean all of them seem
human and so it's it's more about i guess if i would if you were to put me into what i think makes
the most sense the thing i today would wrestle with is ultimately is nature and existence itself
something i can't put my finger on it beyond just naturalism so like is existence something i'm just not
aware what it is it doesn't seem to be a being or a personal entity or something like that but this weird
thing that we call life that we exist in is that something other than naturalism that that meaning it's
all natural it's laws of nature and that's it or is there something to it beyond that i don't know
that is about as honest of truth that i could get at in terms of what makes the most sense to me
as far as a being i understand people want to project their consciousness on to something else higher up
they want to say there's a mind because we have minds but this is also why drawing that particular argument
could say well god has a dick because i have a dick um god likes to have sex because i like to have sex like
why not continue because that's exactly what the ancient text of the bible says god is just a reflection of us
i knew you i knew you're referencing i knew you're referencing um francesca this is but that's where i'm at
like bro like we're animals we are yeah it's it just i don't know this is a hard question you ask me
because i don't think there's any world religion there are certain philosophies though about like buddhism
and meditation and stuff that i like there's philosophies of stoicism that i like there's things
that i like that's why i asked if you mean true as in like there's something that is that rings a bell to me
something that i think would be good practice as a human as a as an animal right in this world
that i live in sure but as this one's the truth bro you know don't don't put me in that category
because i'm just like uh well that's this is why it's a great question because and and it's interesting
to hear different people's perspective i think i'm not sure i think michael drone's chose like an
eastern religion which is really interesting um but you can go back and you can listen to like you
got atheists you got agnostics you got christians you got different it's it's a question you can ask
almost any religion because it makes them analyze beliefs critically and it's it's it's it's it's an
interesting question because it gets you to process the idea of faith differently but i like what you
said there about like maybe there's more to naturalism and i think you and this actually ties in really well
you would probably get a lot out of the shinto episode which is the first episode of 2023 um
that i just need to plug this quickly yeah hatelyn is like she so she helped a whole series she
was a co-writer for the whole series on religion for breakfast um uh i think it's religion for
breakfast oh no i should have i should have double checked she is like a phd candidate she
is written in this book the bloom bag handbook to japanese religions i have a hard copper copy coming
and shinto is really interesting because like it's seen throughout like anime seen throughout um
it's like japanese homegrown religions like there's like a bunch of gods of like rice right like
everything has like a life force there's like a life force and everything uh and oh no i want to
learn more about it's gonna be a really cool episode um so if you like this kind of content
make sure you subscribe um so you can um watch that and ask questions uh jojo freelancer in the chat
says uh maybe judyism that includes new testament the koran you can go ahead and check off like off the box
abrahamic faiths to me like you can just check those and put those as in they are not the truest
that's where i'm at yeah so this is just no i mean i understand people want to project
their things but like it to me every step of the way in it is man it's it's human it's all human
so you know and i think the same even of the eastern philosophies too like what we're you know so
anyway i can go on this and yeah and i love that you are going on and on about it um i hope
you're okay just going over a couple of minutes um we are wrapping up though and one one one thing
i did want to say um as well is i did mention that no one rose to the challenge to tell me a
miracle they've experienced that wasn't it was a diss it was a diss you know i was dissing but
that i understand why people might not want to have done that because they might
thought that i was like pulling it apart however if you have had an experience something that i'm
doing um i'm playing with the idea of is doing deep drinks quick sips so i'll do like a 10 minute
interview with with an interesting idea concept and if you like that kind of stuff you can post
your miracle into the form um which is um here you can get an access to my twitter and you just
tell us about like what like a story that you've had and i might interview about it and put you on
the channel um and um the other thing i just want to mention before we before we wrap up is next
year my wife and i are having our first kid through IVF so it might be a little bit around
january 20 time it might be a little bit chaotic so i hope you bear with me but i thank you thank
you so much everyone for coming out subscribing and supporting myself and derrick make sure you go
over and and um support derrick on miff vision um and derrick thank you so much for coming on it's been
an absolute pleasure is anything is anything that you want you want to say um before we leave
um keep going break through the barrier of your right even now that i think that these
religions are false or not literally true i find truth this is why i mentioned uh in many stories
i find truths when i watch iron man i watch truths in dc comics i i find truth in real
historical events i find truth in myth and legend and and i think to paint the ancients as idiots
is wrong i think what we should do is understand that they were in their own space time and this is
what their world looked like to them that doesn't mean i'm saying they're morally right and even in
their own space they might have been morally in the wrong there's stuff we can learn that's what i'm
saying and i think we yeah what sorry and i keep saying we're gonna wrap this up but i keep
this is so interesting you know you know how like a lot of christians will say um slavery was
gold was just working inside the paradigm of the time zoroastrianism forbid slavery and they were
around the same yeah i mean i've got a fact i've got a fact check this i saw this on like and this
was an actual uh it was um one of hank green i think it was i'm really suspect of that i'm not gonna lie
i'm very suspect i would speak to someone who knows the history of it was it was on crash court
it was crash course history that i was watching so yeah i need to check that out i'm kind of
i'm kind of suspect that they didn't have slavery at all um most empires literally survived off of
yeah well that's why they mentioned it is that they mentioned it because it was like it was
that way outside but if okay if that's true that's big that's a huge right yeah that would be big
demolishes that argument but anyway keep wrapping up sorry i got yeah no no just um i find too often
i'm gonna speak to the skeptics out there i find too often that we you could tell people are hurt
by the religion to the point where they just want it to be false rather than like
trying to get the therapy they need the time that they need so they they can actually enjoy
this stuff for what it is because it's not what i'm saying christians have monopolized new
testament canon um jewish people have monopolized he revival i'm saying go and read this stuff as
literature go and read this stuff as legends in the first century and and investigate it like you'd
read sutonius like you'd read the greek mythologies read this in the genre that it is and stuff have fun
with it because once you see all that other stuff it really rips the fear of like oh is this true
like am i gonna go to hell if i don't accept it you're like read it far and wide keep reading
i love this stuff and i want to get people who are atheist skeptics agnostics theists that are more
liberal man i have people who support me who are christians but they're not fundamentalists
and they're like of course same we love what you're doing yeah so one of my discord mods is a christian
one of the two discord mods i have is a christian um wow that's awesome yeah i mean and i want to show
that more right like we're not a community of atheist we're not a community of you must be like us
