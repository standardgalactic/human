I don't think you can go soft on that. I am not going to condemn the man. I'm going to condemn the

Abrahamic ones, have been a culprit of 15% of the creative working population on this earth
to sleep saying you're only good at home. You're not good for anything else.
Ideas don't have human rights. If it's wrong, you got to call it a spade a spade. It's wrong.
