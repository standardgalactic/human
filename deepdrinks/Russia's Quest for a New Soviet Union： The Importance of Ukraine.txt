So half people basically brainwashed,
don't understand shit, especially elderly people, I would like to say.
And some of them are just straight up like fascists at this point.
Ideology wise.
So there's that.
And there is, of course, like maybe 15, 20 percent if I'm charitable of people
who understand everything and who are deeply ashamed and but feel like they're
helpless and there's nothing they can do to like affect anything.
