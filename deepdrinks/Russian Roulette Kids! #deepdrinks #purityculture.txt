When you use a condom, it's like you're playing Russian roulette.
There is less chance that when you pull the trigger, you're going to get a bullet in your head.
But who wants to play Russian roulette with a condom?
So the next time that somebody wants you to go to bed with them, with or without a condom,
then just picture that you're actually going to bed. It's not just you and him or you and her.
It's that you're packing along a loaded revolver with you when you go.
When you use a condom, it's like you're playing Russian roulette with a condom.
