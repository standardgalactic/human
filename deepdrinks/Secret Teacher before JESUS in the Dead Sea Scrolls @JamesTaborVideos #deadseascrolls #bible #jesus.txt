So it's like we found their New Testament, you might say, if you understand what I mean by that.
Because we've got their actual writings. In the case of the Dead Sea Scrolls, guess what we have?
I think we can date this teacher to maybe about 100 years before the time of Jesus,
maybe 150 years. We don't have an exact date for him. We don't know his name, but they call him
the Teacher of Righteousness. That's what you're going to hear most.
But also, it can be translated, the true teacher, meaning the right teacher. Rabbi means teacher.
This is the true Rabbi. And so they clearly think he's the one. They say about him that God has
revealed to him all the mysteries of the prophets. So this is an amazing figure to them, who's like
a new Moses. And again, the new covenant and so forth. They think they're the children of life.
