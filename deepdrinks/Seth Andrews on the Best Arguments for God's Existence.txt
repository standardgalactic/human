What are the best arguments for the existence of God?
I just get a litany of crap.
You know, Hitler was an atheist.
I hear that one, and that's crap.
That's totally bogus.
He invoked God in mind-conf.
He had God with us on the Nazi belt buckles.
He claimed that the extermination of the Jews
was God's good work, you know?
Where do your morals come from?
You can't have morality
without the objective moral standards.
I've heard the complexity of the I argument
that proves an intelligent designer.
The Bible is true because there are specific places
mentioned in the Bible that exist today.
