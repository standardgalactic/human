and what, like, we couldn't have had a better episode to start with to learn about a religion that I know.
Almost nothing about Shinto, so this is going to be really good with Caitlyn terrified.
But before we jump into it, I got two quick announcements we are doing as a deeprink family we are doing dry January,
so everyone knows we drink a lot on this channel at one stage.
Water.
me drinking, you know, straight vodka or rum at 10 am. So it is, it is quite, it's although
it's acceptable to day drink in Australia, I think sometimes it's good to add some balance.
So to be responsible as part of the deep drinks community, we're doing dry January this year.
So today we're not drinking alcohol, but it's going to be all good, all the same type
of awesome conversation that we normally have. And we just make sure that if you are noticing
that you're drinking too much, just it is good to have a break every now and again,
just to make sure you're not developing any unhealthy habits, because obviously it's very
easy to do because drinking is a good time. The other thing I do want to mention is we are
going to be doing some deep drinks panels this year. So I did a panel on hell and the history
of hell in the Christian, in Christendom, in the Christian denomination, in Catholicism,
and where the roots of hell came from and where and how to deconstruct the fear of hell for people
who may be still struggling, even if you are a Christian or an atheist or whatever you are,
how to how these fine folks help get over that fear and also learn about where the history of
hell came from. So I did it on my main channel and I went down really well and I thought let's
bring this to deep drinks. So we'll be doing deep drinks panels on every witch concept you can
think of. So look forward to that coming up this year on deep drinks. But before that's it for
the announcements and let's just jump straight into the interview. I need to introduce Caitlyn Eugretz,
who is an anthropologist of religion and a PhD candidate in the Department of East Asia Languages,
sorry, in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies at UC Santa Barbara.
Caitlyn specializes in Japanese religion, globalization, technology and media. You can read
her work in the Bloomsbury handbook of Japanese religion, which is like a textbook that I don't have
because it didn't come in time, but I have read the PDF version. I have ordered it though and it is
an awesome read. It's got many different authors and you can watch her work on the religion for
breakfast popular Shinto series, as well as a YouTube channel Eat, Pray, Anime. Welcome Caitlyn Eugretz.
Hi everybody, Akemashteyo, Melodokizanas, happy new year. Hey, how's it going?
Hey, good, very good, very good. Thank you so much for coming on. It's a real treat to have an anthropologist
of religion on deep drinks. You're the first. I think you're the first, at least with that title.
Thanks for having me.
So what are we drinking today, Caitlyn? We are drinking Genmaicha. If I'm not lagging out.
No, it's fine. It's fine. It looks fine. Okay, it's a little laggy on my side. So we're drinking
Genmaicha. A little bit of history about Genmaicha. There's a lot of myths about how this tea was created.
Basically, it's green tea with some brown rice that's roasted in it.
There are a lot of myths about how Genmaicha was created. There you go. Shout out to my
favorite tea provider, Adagio. It's really good. You can get this pretty much anywhere.
Yeah, well, I mean, it took me three weeks to get delivered from wherever it is, but that's because
I live in Australia like that. But it smells delicious and I'm about to have my first sip. Yeah,
so tell us about the history of it. Yeah, so Genmaicha, otherwise known as
brown rice tea or the people's tea, is made with green tea and also roasted brown rice. Sometimes
it's called popcorn tea because when you actually toast the rice, sometimes it puffs up like popcorn,
but there's actually no popcorn in it. And there are a lot of myths about the start of it.
One of the popular ones is that there was a servant serving his samurai lord and the servant's
name was Genmaicha, which means brown rice. And he was pouring tea and he was maybe stealing
some rice from his employer. And a couple of the grains of rice slipped into the drink.
And the samurai lord had his servant beheaded for sullying his tea. And then he decided he'd
like sit down and try it out. And then he decided that he liked it. Oh no, can't put the head back on.
Probably the more historically accurate legend is that a very savvy merchant was trying to stretch
an expensive supply of green tea that he had and so they added rice kernels.
Interesting. Which gives it its like grassy notes from the green tea and like nutty flavor
from the the rice. It's really delicious. And so because green tea was expensive,
stretching it out using just a little bit of green tea and then more rice made it more accessible
and affordable for commoners. And then this kind of tea, they used the green tea that's harvested
later in the year, which was also less expensive. And it caught on and everybody could enjoy a cup
of nice tea. So nowadays people think that it's, aside from being delicious, is good for like digestive
health. It's really comforting with this like nutty flavor. And it's also favored by people who are
fasting for religious purposes. So there's your little legend scoop. So hang on, we're like what we're
like a few minutes in and you're already educating us dive hugely. Yes, this is awesome. I'm loving this.
This is actually delicious too. Oh, I'm glad you enjoy it. I got it. I took my wife some special
little tea cups out for this. But it wasn't enough. So I got my man mug on the side here. I got two cups
going. So later in the pot, I'm going to break out this green tea flavored soda. We'll see if it's any
I've never had it before. So it's actually super interesting because because I think I remember
hearing that prawns were the same thing or you might call them shrimp over in the US where oh really
they weren't they weren't see is they weren't seen as like a luxury thing that was seen as like
if you you know something you could just get if you could like the poor kind of drink and it's like if
this was stretching out you know it's trying to make tea last longer it's like the same concept now
it's seen as like it's expensive like compared to just like a tea bag. So it's interesting how
how things change our cultural perspectives change around things like that. Definitely yeah the kind
of green tea that we're drinking now is sencha which is actually like a nicer form of green tea.
You can even get it with some matcha green tea powder added in which they never would have done
you know in the pre-modern period when they were probably around the 1900s so the modern period
they were drinking this. You know the whole point was to make it cheap and now it's yeah it's its own
cultural thing so they they make it bougie we're drinking the bougie version of commander's tea.
Yeah nice so is um if we if do you drink at all like i'm alcohol uh on oh yes life.
If it wasn't dry january we would have been having sake. Okay awesome awesome i i've only spent
five days unfortunately in japan when my my younger brother was um living there we went to visit him on
the way through to europe and um when we went to europe for the first time and we uh we had sake and
and it was very delicious um and i don't remember much more of the night well i do remember it but
there was it just goes it goes from me having sake and with a few other things to everyone chanting as
i was sculling a big um and they call me davis davis davis davis i'm like that's not my name but yeah
so it was a good time so um so you've been pretty busy we've been chatting back and forth on emails
what have you been up to lately before we jump into the history of shinto sure what have i
been up to lately well other than being on the job market and trying to finish my dissertation
i've been working on my youtube channel eat pray anime where we uh talk about japanese religion
through the lens of popular culture so oh there it is there it is my channel oh my face yep so
i haven't come out with any videos in a couple of months my most recent one is actually an exclusive
interview with comic book illustrator extraordinaire peach momoko who's been working on a wonderful
series for marvel called demon days oh it's me so um peach momoko although she's very famous
is also extremely just like humble and a little bit shy so we we speak we talk in japanese during
this interview and she instead of having her face on the camera draws us an exclusive illustration
of her character from demon days for marvel comics which was super fun so cool i have a new series
that i'm working on which is why nothing's come out recently on uh shamanism and japanese religion
so myself and a couple of my friends are putting together the videos for that so the first video
on an introduction to shamanism through the anime shaman king should be coming out in a in a month or two
interesting that's that's awesome i
sorry i have these two two books is this a good book for shamanism i picked it up
oh elia day yeah so he's the og in terms of uh studying shamanism from an an armchair
religious perspective so uh we might be critiquing elia day a little bit okay
uh one book that i can recommend actually is indigenous religious traditions in five minutes
okay there's only maybe two articles in here very short one to two pages on uh shamanism and how
it relates to uh indigenous religious traditions but my friend and simpson who wrote uh one of the
pieces on shamanism will actually be my first guest in the series so elia day he's definitely
in the canon he's one of the the major scholars that introduce uh you know the concept of shamanism
to the field i didn't catch what the other book was uh maybe who does a really good job this isn't
shamanism but it's something i want to talk about later it's called yeah ghostly japan um and it's ghost
stories from japan uh yes one of them is that my noriko reader uh la face la feisteo herne
oh la feisteo herne okay yes you can definitely talk about him but the the the song the uh the personal
karma which is about the nalpi i read it down um it's a famous like play i think um in japan
where did i write it um boton doro peony lantern oh okay yes yeah so that that thing i read that one
night and i was like january i was like this is this is a cool story this is spooky
as yeah so yeah um so let's jump into but before we do we have our um our first comment
from uh digital hamarabi are you kidding me dav mcdonald again he can't substantiate the
necessary ground ground for all instantiation for the pre conditions of ultimate providing
impossible possibilities impossibilities keep running scared david so he's a friend he's that's
that's dr josh he's uh isn't a serial just he always likes to come in and just uh and quote uh
big talk it's a it's an internet meme but it's always funny to read it out right lord i'll
know i know it's so um so let's talk about let's talk about let's talk about let's talk about
shinto so what is shinto we've just an introduction because we okay so i'm i'm i'm a abrahamx faith
konaboy like i know about um i know about christianli judeism um at islam i know a little bit
about hinduism like i've read the bug of agita and stuff but but when it comes and i've read a little
bit of buddhism but i haven't i don't know anything about shinto so please tell us what is shinto
and when did it start i wish i could tell you what shinto is this is one of the the the deep
questions of of the field of shinto studies what is shinto um if anybody figures out definitively
what it is please please let me know um this is one of those things that scholars will go back
and forth about for forever and we can we can kind of unpack that later but so my personal informed
definition for shinto is that it is a ritual tradition that started originates in japan
that is dedicated to the veneration so the worship for for lack of a better term of
these deities called kami so uh when you when you hear me talking about kami i'm not uh referring
to uh communists i'm talking about japanese deities a lot of people like to comment like oh
those kamis i'm like the cold wars over people talking about japan well you'd think that the cold
wars over but there's a lot of kami is popping up online at the moment so so yeah so generally
shinto is a ritual tradition that focuses on these deities called kami so kami are thought to live
they're imminent so they live in the world around us so you can find them in forces of nature
like thunder and fire uh there are particular kami that have kind of names and personalities
we could talk about mythology a little bit later even people can be kami uh there are a few notable
examples such as uh this one kami tenjin who used to be a court official and scholar
in the 1100s who died and haunted the court and then people were just so
uh beset by the spirit of of this guy who had been exiled and then died in exile
that they decided to worship him as a deity and even the emperor of japan um is or has been
thought to be um a deity so the the kami are these deities that are originate maybe in japan
but we can talk about that a little bit more later when we maybe when we talk about buddhism
yeah okay because i was i was going to um yeah in fact i will i'll i'll bring us to the buddhism thing
and bring us back but just touch on that when buddhism first arrived in um in japan there was
is a true that i think this was part of your series because i watched a lot of stuff
really in preparation for this but the series that you did with religion for breakfast um
which was fantastic by the way i recommend everyone goes and watches that so
people consider there were certain clans i think that's the right word or groups or cool
clan that that's that's that's all buddhist um deities as part as kamis and then there were
other people who said no no no the the it's the other way around is that right
yes uh so this has been a long historical conversation in japan so uh sorry you i'll
start at the beginning so you asked me um when shinto started let's let's start there
because it'll yeah let's go let's go back let's go back around yeah yeah sure so it's really
hard to talk about the origin of of shinto uh because the that these uh ritual traditions
that are focused on the kami have uh been around since before we have records in japan right
in sort of ancient period right but we only have the the term or the the chinese characters
used for uh shinto used uh later in like the seventh century um or the eighth century in in japan
and when those characters are used uh scholars such as uh john breen have argued that they don't
actually mean shinto as we think about it today and that uh this this religious tradition that we
kind of think of as a semi coherent whole doesn't really pop up until the modern period so
we can talk about kami worship and uh kami cults small c like no scare quotes cults just like
small groups of religious traditions um early in in japanese history but it becomes very difficult
to talk about shinto as a kind of united self-identified tradition until later in japanese history
earliest like 1700s okay so that being said there were uh people worshiping kami uh when the
buddha and and buddhism or buddha's plural came to japan in the sixth century so in the 500s uh
buddhism comes from india through china through the korean peninsula all the way down to japan
and at that point when you have these kind of native deities meet these foreign deities
uh people basically said oh well these these foreign deities must be similar to the ones that we
have they're just foreign kami and then the buddhas had to explain no it's a little deeper than
that you know we have this whole tradition uh and so this was the beginning of over a thousand
years of history of people who worship kami and and buddhists who are often the same people
um discussing like how they could be related yeah okay so i i've always found it interesting
that you know there's the argument that buddhism isn't necessarily a religion or the buddha wasn't a
religious prophet but he was more like a philosopher um who was who gained enlightenment whatever that
means in this context and and the reason why there's you know inside of buddhism there's reincarnation
and and all all of all of those things is because that was the cultural norm inside of india at the time
that's what they thought that's what the the general populace thought um correct me from wrong um
that's how i i've i've heard it talked buddhism we talked about is that similar to the kami in that
there wasn't like this organized like this is shinto when we follow shinto of course you mentioned
that that word shinto didn't even arrive until you know only 500 three years ago or something but
the the idea of kami worship has been around for much much longer is that right yes um so you know the
issue of whether buddhism is or isn't a religion is also an issue that we see in shinto as well
so it's important to recognize that like the term in english you know religion um it didn't have a
an equivalent in the japanese language until the modern period so one episode in japanese history
that was really a turning point is um in the mid 1800s when komidor mathew perry who is an american
naval officer comes to japan and says hey you know you need to open up to trade and other things
because we would like to buy and sell with you and make lots of money and at that time the shogun who
is the military leader of japan uh always you know thinking it over and part of the the terms of the
treaty that eventually was uh agreed upon between uh the american you know naval officers who rolled
up in their gunships and were basically like hey you know we're gonna blow shit off if you're not
gonna open trade to us uh one of the terms of this treaty between the shogunate the the samurai
government and uh the american navy was religious freedom and suddenly in this kind of legal and
military context uh the the the government of the archipelago that we now think of as japan
um had to suddenly figure out like uh what qualifies as religion and what doesn't and this
question continues through uh the the middle 1800 until 1868 when the meiji government um which is
kind of the the beginnings of the modern state of japan we could talk about the japanese government
at that time took over and in their constitution in the 80s they also had uh the article for
religious freedom and so suddenly as uh jason joseph's storm in the invention of religion in japan
uh excellent book 2011 and uh julian baraka thomas's book faking liberties which really you know
dives into the issue of uh american and japanese relations and the issue of religious freedom uh
the japanese government had to decide what was religion and what wasn't so at that point uh we have
the translation of the the english term religion into japanese shukyo which basically means like
sectarian teachings um so the term like kyo had been applied to uh buddhism previously buddhism in in
japanese is bukyo you know the the the sectarian teachings are the doctrine of the buddha but shinto
is is not a kyo or a doctrine it's a it's a dou like uh the dao daoism the way or any kind of
martial art tradition uh like aikido judo kendo that dou is the same and so shinto wasn't really
didn't really fit into this idea of doctrine um but it was kind of religious enough that the the
government had to decide whether or not it was a religion and so at that point the government
had decided what was shinto at this point we can talk about shinto um in those terms and then it kind
of separated shinto into sectarian or religious shinto so at this point they're thinking of religion
as a a private or a personal faith and separate from that was kind of civil rituals so uh rituals that uh
are important to the emperor and um the sun goddess amaturasu who we'll talk about would be get to
mythology i don't want to get too deep but basically and that is what we do here i'm so sorry
deep dreams for getting deep really quick yeah uh the government had to decide what was religion
and what was not shinto was split between religious shinto and like national patriotic shinto so some of
it was religious and optional and some of it was patriotic and like not optional so uh prior to this
whole debacle in the 1800s we can't really talk about the term religion um in japan uh in terms of
shinto or even even buddhism this was a really new conversation for them they just didn't think about
these ritual traditions and deities uh in the same way that uh western empires did
interesting there's so many parallels i'm doing a lot of research at the moment
into aboriginal australia um as you know like a really old culture i think the oldest culture
um in the world and i've got this this map at home and it's like all the aboriginal nations and
language groups i know none of them absolutely none of them i know nothing about aboriginal culture
and it is one of the oldest in the world and it's the like the country of which i'm born in
you know and it's like i know nothing about and i'm like that's really sad that i know more about
greek mythology and everything else then and it's kind of like it's kind of like i think the reason
is is is kind of what is is is i can kind of empathize with the japanese people it's like
the outside world comes in they're like hey we do things this way and they're like scrambling to try
and make sense of like okay well how do we fit our stuff into these boxes um you know what is religion
what is ceremony what is ritual what like and having to try and fit their way of life into the
outside perspective and i think unfortunately for aboriginal australia um it hasn't gone too well
because they it hasn't hasn't been adopted or or and i think it's a real shame um but when it comes
to when it comes to shinto is there is there do you see a difference between because what you do is
um is participant observation right so you you run you help run ceremonies and things like that over
in japan um is there is there a do you see a difference between the rituals that maybe someone
might do for good luck or to pray to the kami as part of a tradition or like saying grace before
dinner when your family's not really religious or something versus people who have like a deep
other people have like a deep spiritual connection with this concept of shinto or is that not something
really relevant to shinto um i hope that the question makes sense no it does yes um so yes
i think uh what what i hear you saying is that there's a spectrum of sort of like cultural
and um just like not really civil but like everyday rituals that people do whether or not they
have deep feelings or personal investment in a particular tradition all the way over to um you know
more personally invested in a particular tradition in a great example might be like mobster
where's that word come from but like the mafia will they'll do like uh like you know the russian
not russian but you know like someone who may be practicing catholic traditions like confession
and stuff but they're they're like you know killing people or whatever like they're they're
doing things like they're doing rituals to help themselves or praying to certain saints and stuff
doing things but they don't have necessarily this like this like deep internal like conviction
towards the religion they're just doing it as part of a tradition is there is that is that
dichotomy in shinto is is there a dichotomy like that in shinto or is it is that not even a question
that's logical to ask in the concept of shinto that's a really good question um so like figuring out
degrees of belief or or like personal identification and um investment in like particular ideas or or
spiritual powers is a very western religious concept right um so i do think that we see this
spectrum throughout japan there are some people who will just stop by a shrine um because they have
something going on in their life and who doesn't you know appreciate a little you know boost in luck
um and then there are people who go to shrines you know every single day and have a very personal
relationship with particular kami um and and really feel that that presence in their lives
more strongly so i think that we see this this wide range of responses and investment in shinto
from the laity you know folks who aren't shinto priests uh we see that we see that in japan as well
because of this kind of really baggage heavy history of like the term religion and what it means to be
religious you know as a kind of foreign concept in japan uh sorry if you can hear my dog that's okay
we're dog friendly stream my dog doesn't great when you ask people if they're religious uh
they they tend to say no because when they think of religion it's kind of big are orthodoxy
they think of doctrines and founders and sacred texts which is not really something that shinto has
but if you ask people uh and and these are backed up by surveys like do you go to shrines
do you give offerings do you uh you know pray to the deities a lot of people will say yes they do it
once a year at new years which is a very special time in japan or at particularly
trying times in their life at milestones that type of thing um so when you're talking as an
anthropologist when you're talking about any you know large group of people there is a huge
range in how people respond to things so it's hard to talk about you know shinto as one huge thing
there's a lot of uh diversity um but generally speaking because shinto is primarily thought of
as as a do as a way of living your life as a set of customs and traditions um you do see a lot of
people in japan that that participate in that and and might not think of it as you know religion
interesting interesting that's that's uh very interesting i i'm not sure if i've ever
shared this this story um on on the stream but i'll share i'll share it in the future but part of
my part of my experience but when i was a christian is i went to these shinto shrines
in in japan and i noticed that people were doing certain rituals like they were putting
incense in and they're blowing the smoke on their face or they're putting the smoke on their
face as like a cleansing uh that would have been a buddhist temple uh okay that was outside the
asakusa temple um which is i think has shinto connected to uh i'm not sure i'm not 100% sure but
i remember i remember for me that was a really stumbling block in my faith because i saw these
these people doing something that i considered not part of like my religious um worldview and i looked
at that and was like and i thought to myself like are they really being cleansed like of the of
whatever's happening and then if they i grew up in a very pentecostal speaking in tongues everything
demons kind of church so i'm looking at that going are they really being cleansed and even if
they weren't being cleansed or whatever is happening to them doesn't matter like if you could prove
to them that nothing was happening doesn't matter and then i was like what about my beliefs and then
i started questioning like what exactly so that for me it was a big moment for me i'll go into that
story one one time in the future because that's a big part of my journey but um not in this podcast
but another one but yeah there's it was really interesting to see that but i did enjoy going
to the there was one shinto temple we went to in tokyo where you like you wash your hands at
the start um i think it's uh the really popular one near um shibuya the big one um yeah i forgot
what it's called but it was i should have got the name for it but yeah it was it was really good one
there are so many of them is is the tricky part right yeah um was it in the middle of like a big
forest oh yeah and it was like barrels of of sake yes i know exactly what you want that is
actually uh that's meiji jingu meiji shrine meiji grand shrine that's right yeah in the middle of
tokyo um it's it's beautiful it's stunning and you're in the middle of the city and then all of a
sudden yes bam you feel like you're in the wilderness and it's like it's really cool i loved it
that's one of my favorite examples yeah um so so how long has uh
um shinto existed in not shinto i guess um kami worship how long has kami worship existed
like when does the first when can we trace the roots of kami of this tradition back to like
estimations sure oh okay so this gets into archaeology which is yeah not exactly my field
um but so it's definitely kami worship is thousands of years long the the tricky part
is that the written documents that we have from japan only start in the 700s so when you're
thinking about the ancient period uh you know bc there could be thousands of years of when did worship
of things that could have been coming uh when did writing start have stuff in japan i'm really bad
with history i'm trying to learn but uh that's a really great question uh it's it's hard to say
so i am more familiar with the beginning of uh writing that's based on chinese characters
that comes to japan you know from the asian continent a lot of stuff moves through the asian continent
to uh japan in you know the early uh hundreds ce okay okay yeah so we know that there was more
writing in japan prior to the 700s but it's likely that a lot of it was lost in uh fires
earthquakes or just degraded you know the the materials are are natural they made out of you
know wood a lot of stuff was inscribed on on bamboo uh slats or slips um and you know the difficult
part about uh archaeology is that that stuff breaks down over time so uh the first written works
that we have are from uh 712 and 720 ce which are actually kind of related to shinto mythology
but we know that there was writing prior to that because these texts you know reference
things from from the past but unfortunately they're lost so there's a lot of um debate in japan
japanese archaeology and ancient history about when uh kami worship started it was either in the
the jomon period or the yaya period um so i guess are you a little bit i don't know i don't know
i don't know when they okay uh so uh hmm have you seen avatar of the last air bender
no i haven't but this is like okay this is like explain explain kami to like a sixth grader
that's what you're doing right now so like when is that sorry so uh there there are these these two
ancient civilizations in japan uh the the jomon people are thought to be like the the indigenous
people of japan the so the jomon period the period that this culture is is uh believed to have
but lived in is from 6000 ce to 300 ce wow okay i mean it's really hard to say anything about
that period but archaeologists do their damnedest and i'm not an archaeologist so i'm not going to
speculate about what happened during that period but uh a major turning point in ancient ancient
japanese history is uh when the yaya period starts so the yaya people uh again you're the
whole audience will remember this come from the continent through the korean peninsula to japan and
mingle and displace uh with the the jomon people and they bring with them wet rice agriculture
so bringing uh this type of uh agriculture is really a sea change in the history of japan
and this is when we start to see um you know more people coming together in villages and then
eventually the yaya people um found a state the yamato court and then from then we have a lot
more historical records because the court likes to write down what they're doing uh which goes back
to shinto mythology so it's hard it's really hard to say how far back kami worship may have started
with the the jomon people but we have a lot more evidence uh starting in 300 bc when the yaya way
kind of take over okay interesting and that's condensing like tens of thousands of years into
a nutshell so yeah yeah read more about it i i appreciate it and i can see why you're interested
in this because it's so diverse um and what i really appreciate about appreciate about um yourself
and people like dr josh who is trolling in the chat before is um you guys always well he's he's a
he's a um seriologist um phd and you're you know going to be a phd sure assume sure um is is um
is you'll always say i'm not an expert in this in this area and you'll you'll leave it you'll you'll
always you'll never step outside of your a kind of um area of expertise which i've noticed you've
said a few times you're not expert here i'm an expert here which is really interesting because
um i find that that's a that's a huge dichotomy from some of the um alternative kind of histories
that you kind of see online that like are like you know um fringe ideas about like certain groups
or whatever they'll always say they know everything you know um hey d hey it's nice to see you
and i really appreciate that you you you do that you say we're not an expert in this this is what
i'm an expert in and you try and condense 10 000 years of history into like a just to speak okay so let
me try and um wrap my head around this a little bit so um very complex uh how long shinto has existed
and um the worship of kami has existed um what is shinto from like a religious perspective so let's
say you're talking to in the average australian who may not know anything about buddhism or anything
and maybe they're a christian or something how does how does shinto different differentiate from
say christianity as a religion or another type of religion sure wow that's a big question
that's what we do sorry if any of these questions are too just pivot pivot to something that's more
that's okay um as a as a protestant christian myself um i'm presbyterian this is you know
something that i think about a lot um so some of the basic ways that shinto is different from uh
let's say abrahamic faith uh we can we can talk about you know westard big r religion pretty pretty clearly
so christianity tends to be transcendentalist um there is you know a god that is you know outside
of and kind of you know rules over the universe let's say where in religious studies terms whereas
shinto is more imminent so the the deities of shinto are thought to kind of live
around and and beside the the people who who worship them as i mentioned earlier a lot of
the kami are are tied to natural phenomenon um a kami might be thought to reside not permanently
dwell but maybe temporarily in a really old tree or a really impressive rock um one kind of early
phila uh more modern philosopher of uh shinto um uh motorino niaga um
he said that uh you know the kami provoke the sense of like awe or wonder um that is you know
in in the natural world that being said kami are not all natural so a lot of people like to boil
shinto down to a nature religion um but that's not really what it is i've had a lot of the folks
who i've talked to who practice shinto outside of japan and might not be japanese themselves
compare shinto to catholicism in the fact that they're both very ritual heavy so in shinto most of
the energy is is put into how to do certain rituals appropriately in order to uh live in
harmony with these kami so the kami have the power to either punish you if they don't like what
you're doing or to kind of bless you um if you uh propitiate them and are are grateful for
their blessings kami are thought to have like this generative power so for example people
conduct rituals in shinto um for a good harvest um at the beginning of the rice planting season at
the end of it at certain periods during the year um so you know kind of cultivating uh this good
relationship and then you know the blessings that are are consequent of this happy relationship but
the kami is really important um so there is a lot of ritual involved in in shinto so one view of
western religion is that you know they have a particular founder and a sacred text like the bible
or the koran and uh you know some kind of doctrine you know what uh adherents of the religion believe
shinto doesn't quite have any of those you can't uh trace these rituals to the kami back
to any one particular person there are a variety of traditions within shinto uh from one shrine
to the next or dedicated to one god to the next um there's no sacred text really there are prayers
that have uh called norito which have been handed down to the generations and there's mythology
but there isn't like a single text that people um think there's like a sacred you know inspiration
behind um that they need to really like memorize and live by and uh in terms of doctrine there isn't
really anything you know hard uh that you need to adhere to in order to practice shinto uh generally
some of the concerns within shinto are you know living in harmony uh with the kami and um maintaining
uh personal purity um which i can unpack a little bit if you like yeah let's unpack it unpack it for
sure sure so you mentioned earlier that when you went to meiji shrine you had to wash your hands
right yeah when you enter under the the tori gate which is the it's usually big and red it's not
always big it's not always red uh it's not even always would um uh my next project is all about
tori gate so i will not go down that rabbit hole um after you enter under the tori gate that's a
marker of sacred space you're entering into a a pure space in which the kami reside when you enter
this space uh it's thought that like you have uh you carry with you impurities from the mundane the
profane world that you're stepping in from so you've been walking through the city all day um you
know maybe you went to a restaurant or whatever and so you're coming into the sacred space you need
to purify yourself in order to be in right relationship with the kami uh purification can happen
in a number of ways in shinto one way is uh through the use of water uh when we get to shinto mythology
eventually uh i can i can talk about the origins of of harae oh beautiful yes that is meiji shrine
yeah so this is us uh i don't want to show too much stuff because i don't know what's on here
maybe you might have a picture of you washing your hands yeah it will be one of us washing our hands
somewhere yeah you gotta take a picture i have so many of them but yeah it was a lot you're looking
for that there's usually like a a water fountain where oh there's the sake barrels and the wine
barrels um you have to wash your hands so using running water is one way of purifying yourself
there are two types of so the opposite of purification purity is pollution right there are
two types of pollution uh according to shinto thought there's my dad um the first is uh kegare
which is uh i relate it to to dust or dirt it's just something that you pick up from
living in the world you don't become impure from anything wrong that you did it's just you know
living in the world you get a little dirty when you come to talk to the gods you need to
clean up right maybe you wear a button or shirt or whatever you got to wash your hands so uh kegare
is is this type of just pollution that comes from living in the world there's a second type
to me sometimes it's uh translated as sin but this has a lot of you know like christian baggage to it
but basically it comes from the violation of a taboo so it could be a social taboo it could be
something that pisses the kami off uh so it's something that you did that was improper uh and in in that
case uh that also causes pollution and so shinto is really focused on uh purifying oneself at regular
intervals as well as when you enter sacred space um in order to talk to uh the kami so that's all about
that on purification is is there like certain because i know that obviously in the abrahamic faith
there was there was a lot of especially in the old testament there was a lot of um of the
Hebrew Bible the old testament of the christian bible there's a lot of uh if you're you know if
you're if you've got certain physical disabilities you can't enter the holy of holies um if you're
you know it's i'm happy to say that your church you mentioned before stream that your church is very
LGBT friendly um but there are a lot of churches that that aren't because they reference certain
scriptures uh is there anything like that uh in shinto where um or is there misogyny in shinto
or anything like that or any of these i guess um not to be rude but old yeah moral ideas i guess from
before before when we had toilet paper kind of thing like very old concepts i've never heard
that that's a really interesting way of marketing time before we had toilet paper yes before we had toilet
paper uh disability um as well as being a woman uh we're we're considered sources of of pollution
uh potentially um really yes uh so one source of pollution is for example uh contact with death
yeah um which anybody can have another source of uh pollution is uh blood
um so uh menstruation women priests yes you're ahead of me um uh have to deal with this notion of
you know menstrual blood can be uh polluting or childbirth can be polluting uh my colleague
dr dana mersalis um is uh turning her dissertation into a book specifically focuses on
women priests in you know the shinto priesthood and how they deal with both misogyny and also
you know more uh theological ideas of of pollution um because shinto is a is a ritual
techni tradition and has these kind of ritual technologies to deal with pollution women and
other folks have found ways of purifying themselves um so that it's it's less of an issue there like
there's basically like a ritual hack for that now okay cool um and other people don't see it so much as
an issue um my my friend dr mersalis has talked to women who say yeah you know i don't really think
that's like a contemporary thing i don't think the kami are really worried about that but then
she'll talk to somebody else at the same shrine and they'll have a very different view of it so as
anthropologist uh i'm very wishy washy about like what people think because as soon as you find
somebody who thinks something you find someone else who believes the opposite you know but yeah um
disability and also being a woman um definitely enter into these discussions of of pollution
impurity uh sometimes women in uh japanese religious traditions including shinto but also
like shugendo which is a mountain ascetic tradition that's related to shinto but not also
there are certain like mountains or areas that women are not supposed to like enter into
uh right for dudes
d said god made us gross yeah we can would we like to okay i know there was a question
or two yeah let's get to let's get to there's two questions um thanks for turning out guys i know
that we've had a couple weeks off so it's good that it's good that some of you guys have come back
to say hello um so the first question is from palma mech math uh is there any relation to
i'm not going to pronounce that german period okay yeah okay can you read that question
yes okay hello everybody hi palmer thanks for all this hope you could answer my question here
but is there any relation to jomon period dogu figurines and shinto practice or regalia
um so no to the best of my knowledge dogu are not related to shinto practice um i'm not an expert
in dogu i'm sorry uh other than um their pokemon manifestations i have no idea what you're talking
about but this is if you if you google uh i recognize that i recognize that pokemon i recognize
that pokemon right that's not it's not a pokemon but i recognize the figurine that look yeah that's
interesting yes so um ball toy and clay doll which are these two pokemon sorry if you don't play
pokemon um are related to these figurines uh called dogu i am not a specialist in dogu so i'm
very sorry um yeah i'm not quite sure none what they're for um they're they they were definitely
related to some kind of ritual tradition um but no one's entirely sure like what they were for
even the experts like they have their own ideas um but it's not like 100 sure uh some of the
shinto uh material culture the you mentioned the term regalia um that we do know pretty well
of are the three imperial regalia so there's the the sword the mirror and the jewel so again when
we get to shinto mythology maybe we should do that next we can uh talk about them but uh they were
very quickly they were gifts given from the imperial ancestors the great great great great great
times a million grandmother of the japanese emperors they were gifts like sacred treasures that
she gave to the emperor as signs of his power so you can maybe see them in museums but there's a
lot of uh argument over are they the real ones are they facsimiles do somebody have a secret
real one somewhere else it's kind of like national treasury and these appear in anime a lot okay uh
they asked how closely is shinto related to the japanese imperial family quite so good good
question uh so we've covered that a little bit um so this is where we get into some of the modern
history of shinto so in terms of like the long tail history of shinto there is this myth that uh
the shinto deity the goddess amaterasu goddess of the sun who lives in shinto heaven is the great
great great great great great great great great great great grandmother of the current japanese emperor
um so that she basically her grandson founded the imperial uh family of japan
in uh the yamato court that i mentioned earlier um kind of carries that on so these rituals to the kami
that are associated with the imperial family are a part of shinto however um during world war two
uh particularly you know the americans and the british and the allied powers in general made a lot of
uh the relationship between um shinto and the imperial family and the imperial family
did the same thing again uh check out faking liberties by dr julian baraka thomas from the
university of pennsylvania uh 2019 i think it came out it's it's so good um so shinto is related
to the japanese imperial family however that part of shinto is not important for a lot of other folks
who who practice shinto so just because you practice shinto doesn't mean you have any particular ideas
about the emperor these days but it is um you know like one key aspect of shinto throughout uh history
that was a lot i condensed so much there i feel i feel like i'm leaving out so much we
i feel like we need to have you on again because i feel like i can't even
we i feel like i'm not even scratching the surface at like how this topic is obviously way bigger than
um than i initially initially there's so much like i feel so unprepared now about like like i thought
i was like i did my research but i feel so i'm like wow you did you did all right so let's see um if you
want to learn more about the history of shinto and if we want to move more into like anthropology
or mythology or something um then you can check out my series for a religion for breakfast on shinto
it's five episodes now it will be six soon a bonus episode will come out um and you can learn more
about the historical relationship between the imperial family the japanese modern government
and shinto um in the third video which is called when shinto became a quote unquote religion
and we break that down like a little bit more um this is a that's the first video yeah this is the
first video and this is a thank you so that will give you like an overview of like what is shinto
where did it start um what is it now and then we break down yeah sorry go ahead i was gonna
say we needed like a like a like we needed everyone to sit down and watch this whole series
before dumping in here so we could like have some because i watched it and it's still i still
feel like i can't sink my teeth in like there's so much to learn um i'm just i'm so sorry so no
it's not your fault i i just come from a very different you know um uh it's interesting because
i come from a very different perspective with the abrahamic faiths and and not knowing much about
japanese culture um and japanese religion obviously um but this would also be a good sorry go
what were you saying uh we're taught a lot about like the abrahamic faiths and like some of the
quote unquote world religions in school right um but sometimes we hear a little bit about shinto
and sometimes we don't hear anything so when i'm when i'm teaching folks about shinto and unless
they're like uh a pretty hardcore japanophile or they've visited some shrines they maybe have
heard of the term before but they they're not really sure like what it is my seventh grade history
teacher which is when you usually learn about like world religions in the america um he did not
do a very good job because he was on drugs so i never learned about shinto until i got to college
really and some folks have heard about it in middle school some folks haven't so um we're we're
always kind of at a disadvantage learning about shinto we just don't have like the same cultural
yeah on ramp that we do about a lot of other traditions and that's why and that's why i'm so glad
to have you on because it's it's always good to learn learn something totally outside i feel i feel
like i can't there's nothing to hold on to i feel like i'm very lost which is which is good i'm so sorry
yeah for some rituals and the kami and you'll be okay so uh i also want to promote obviously you've
got you've written um a few chapters or one chapter and the co-chapter in the bloomsbury
very handbook of japanese religion i have ordered one and it's on its way um that i've read i've read
some of the start of this book and i've read your your chapters are really good of course your
website as well if you want to learn more about kaitlyn and what she's up to you've got links galore
and everything that you're currently working on as well as your amazing epre love epre anime channel
which is which is a good one as as well uh i do i do want to um uh touch on shinto mythology
i want to be careful of your time though because i also want to fit in the anime tier list um at some
stage yes just so just so just so we can um get people fired up in the chat because i know that
everyone will disagree with everyone and it'll be funny um and this is so dangerous so i have on
record our anime pics yeah so let's let's um let's talk a little bit about um the uh
shinto mythology uh let's let's touch a little about that um and then we'll wrap this up with a
um we we only got through like a quarter of what i what i hope to get through but
and then we'll do the anime question and then we'll finish off with some questions so if you guys
have some questions um leave them in the comments and we'll touch on them at the end but um thank you
everyone um let's jump into the mythology and the anthropology sure sure sure okay tell me the
mythology and the anthropology are two completely different things but the the mythology okay here we
go um i will dive less deep this time so shinto mythology when people are talking about it they
usually reference um two texts i mentioned these earlier uh the well i didn't mention them by name but
so the kojiki or the record of ancient matters and the nihon shoki the chronicles of japan
are commissioned by the yamato court which was established by the yayua people see now we're
like cooking with steam we know some things yeah yeah yeah yeah in uh the 700s and 712 for the
kojiki 720 for the nihon shoki we get these imperial histories that are written kind of in
the style of of china so china had these dynastic histories um like the the the book of han from the
han dynasty the book of tang etc they were writing uh similar books themselves because they were
trying to legitimate you know the uh the the emperor and the court of various noble clans
and part of that legitimation was using the mythology um that they had about the kami that
they said that their clans descended from so basically the emperor and all his buddies said
that they were descended from shinto deities the kami even though shinto is not an idea right now
but we'll use a shorthand and they said you know we are very powerful and special because we descend
from these deities and here are their stories so these two um documents the kojiki and the
nihon shoki start with the age of the gods for the age of the kami and they tell certain myths
that were curated um to legitimize their rule so there were probably lots of other myths
about different kinds of kami but the only ones that got recorded and you know reproduced
were these ones related um to the political elites and so uh we we're gonna talk a little bit about
you know what is the shinto creation myth um this is uh tricky because you know it's it's one story
perpetuated well a few stories perpetuated by uh the yama court i need to stop you there actually
the the the shinto creation myth okay so we have creation stories from many religions
and we have um uh islamic young earth creationists who take it the the story of a
adam and eve literally supposed um christian young earth creationists things like that are
their shinto are there people who don't see it as mythology are there like people who see
the story or are they just accepted gen gen like is their young earth shinto um creationists or is
the no not really um that was important to like a couple of dudes in the 1700s and then um
was important to and then and then the modern japanese government felt uh that it was important
to have the creation myths in their textbooks for youth um to kind of support the the propaganda
of the state but nowadays and prior to all of that kind of national um fomenting uh it wasn't
really important whether or not they were you know true or that you believed in them very
strongly um but they would you know they would they would tell the story and it gives you kind
of a handle on maybe where everything started um but where everything starts in these shinto myths
that were recorded um is really nebulous like literally um so you have these um creation gods
three of them that kind of appear out of nowhere and then after these three creation deities more
deities just appear and um the the the koji key for example talks about how um the the the land
or the earth was floating in this like liquid like oil floats on water and that um eventually
kind of like you know these oil droplets come together and start to form the land and it
differentiates from heaven um but this is very ambiguous and amorphous later in the mythology
we start to get some solid ground like literally um there are two deities izanagi and izanami
uh he who beckons and she who beckons which are a uh sister brother wife husband duo um
which we see in in quite a lot of mythology they create the land just to interject there yeah go
ahead um have you played minecraft before i have not played minecraft this is gonna sound
this is gonna sound so cringe and nerdy now oh no tell me about minecraft when i
well when i started a i started there's a group of villages in um minecraft and i bring them
to my part and they're wearing they're wearing red so they look to me um like they look like
i guess um asian um not i guess in the clothing style i guess so i bring them in and i called the
two the the mother and the father even though there is a lot of biologies um izukami and whatever
izanagi and izanami yeah i named i named and i named those two and i like they're there
they're the two then and then i bred all the villages and then that's where all the they're like the
prototypical yeah they're the they're the mother and the father and i made sure they stayed alive
they didn't they died but anyway just thought i would i would tip tip my fedora to the
anyway the actual mythology yeah some kami in the wild right yeah uh so there's a lot that goes on
with them but long story short uh they use this fancy jeweled spear they dip it into the the
turbid waters of the world and the the silt that drips from the spear creates the islands of japan at this
time they really don't care about all of the other land so like in the 1700s they were saying oh no
like they created everything not just japan but at that point they were really only worried about
the islands that you know the folks live on right and uh eventually uh izanagi and izanami
create many other kami as their children and giving birth to uh some very painful deities uh
the some some fire kami izanami unfortunately dies and she goes to the land of darkness uh
which is called yomi uh sometimes called shinto hell but it's it's not really hell
and um so then you kind of get an orpheus and uridisi type story where izanagi goes to the
land of yomi to ask the kami that are kind of uh lording over yomi if he can have his wife back
and it's really dark in there and izanami says uh i'll go ask them you stay here don't try to look
at me and what does he do he tries to look at her so he strikes a match basically and uh sees
that she's like kind of a zombie she's a corpse she's rotting she's infested with maggots and um
he has kind of shamed her and so he she chases him out of of the land of yomi there's more stuff
that happens because he's uh come into contact with pollution he needs to purify himself and so he
goes to a river flowing water and performs misogi which is how you purify yourself with water
and out of this uh divine act of purification he creates three really important diaries in the
shinto pantheon amaturasu the sun goddess the ancestress of the imperial line in japan uh susano
which is a kind of a god of like storms that that's up for debate and uh tsukiyomi who's kind of the
god of the moon and so from this act of purification we get the sun goddess and then because she's the
ancestor of the imperial line who commissioned this book two books about the mythology the rest of
the mythology kind of focuses on her and her descendants i'm gonna stop there because there's
a lot more that is amazing that the zombie park that's creepy i love creepy that i have a video about
that through the lens of naruto so if anybody want two of them so if you want to learn about
izanami and izanagi and then amaturasu susano and tsukiyomi these are my uh two first videos
you will see me looking like a deer in the headlights in this very kitchen before i had a
production value but yeah well we'll talk about naruto there's me in the middle of the pandemic
you can learn more that's awesome and i will be doing that um i'll be definitely learning um that because
i haven't watched neuroto so i didn't watch that episode but i've watched i've spirited away so i've watched
that episode that you see me izaki um so that is so what what is that part of a holy text that
someone can read or a part of a or like where where can someone find that story where do like or is
are you are you combining a bunch of different sources or is there like yeah because i think because
i first reached out to you i think in 2000 i don't know it was on facebook and i reached and i said hey
i saw you in religion for breakfast can you recommend a shinto text i can read
and you're like kind of kind of sorry my answer is always kind of yeah that's okay um
scholarly uh have it um yeah so you can read these these these myths um so the the kojiki
and the nihon shoki the kojiki is easier to get your hands on uh so there are there are three
translations people argue about which is the best one some of them translate the names of the kami
which a lot of people folks find really confusing so like the sun goddess amaturasu if you translate
it it's like shining heaven person uh and so if you want to keep reading like and then shining
heaven person said to rushing raging man blah blah blah even me like i've been studying shinto for a decade
right i'm like who are we talking about um so it's a little tricky um you can read one translation
of the kojiki for free on uh sacred hyphen text dot org they have um the translation by basil hall
chamberlin up there um there's a more recent one by gustav helts but he translates the names
so that's a little tricky but then the rest of the translation is a lot more readable than some of
like the ye olden translations um so if you want to read it for free on the internet here you go this is
it awesome 1919 um wow awesome okay well that's good so um so let's because we're we're all we're
running very quickly out of time and there's so much more i want to cover but that's okay i can
stay for a little longer if if you like um but you've got you know you want to go eat lunch i
mean no no it'll be like i we could be here all day um i think i think what let's not do that if if um
when you're a famous professor you're gonna have to come back on um and hopefully next year and yeah well
yeah hopefully next year but let's let's jump into the anime stuff um yeah because because let's do it we
will be um it would be i'll be in very big trouble if i didn't do the anime stuff so um okay so
now keep in mind i don't know half i don't know any really much of these animes but i asked my
younger brother to create a tier list of 25 animes um and he said he said what do you want and like
he had a million questions so i was like i don't know pop things that are popular things that are
cringe things that aren't cringe like just give me a broad spectrum so uh let's do this so i'll add
this to the stream and i hope you can see that pretty well i can yeah pretty well okay cool okay um
if you can tell me the titles though okay when we get to them that would be helpful awesome so what we'll
do is are you familiar with the tier list yes okay so s is the best d is the worst um so i might get
these names wrong as well um but he wrote them down for me clanad after story so question are we
ranking these in terms of personal preference or like shintoiness let's let's rate like personal
preference yeah but okay you can give it bonus points for whatever you want but let's go look
this is your what you think you think a good and you have to you have to you see one of my favorite
books is ready ready player one right i love ready player one yeah but when i reread it now
because that was the book that got me into books but when i reread it now i'm like oh man this was
so juvenile compared to what i like i still like it but it's a little bit embarrassing when i'm
as well because it's like it's one of my favorite books but so you have to be you have to take all
things into account so although you might find some of these cringy now yeah yeah okay so clanad
clanad after story yeah you know i've never read clanad or or watched it i'm sorry guys
i'm afraid i'm gonna not if you haven't yeah and if you haven't there's so many
enemies but if you haven't seen that that's cool we just won't put it on kill kill kill i kill i like
kill i kill uh oh a i feel like that's a range okay okay cool dragon ball dragon ball z
ooh not uh i've never okay so i've never watched it um i'm like the the od pokemon generation
uh i was born in 94 so when i got to the period where dragon ball z was popular um boys were
annoying and gross so i i naturally dislike dragon ball z but it's not anything related to the actual
series but i'm gonna give it a d sorry guys okay that's cool that's cool um my dress up darling
oh i've never even heard of that one okay i hope he hasn't thrown in some like really messed up like
hentai or something or something i mean why x family oh yeah s that's a good one yes okay
10 out of 10 recommend this is giving me doesn't have anything to do with shinto
okay that's okay season two is coming out it's great love it okay awesome i'll have to
this will give me a good understanding of where i should start because i'm not a huge anime
watcher myself but i i will say that i love i love anime i watch a fair amount but you know
being a phd student i don't have a lot of free time so a lot of this i watched in like middle
school high school college yeah i'm a little out of date i'm sas no i get the vibe that you're quite
busy um when we were talking you're like well i'm in this country here i'm doing doing this and
doing this and like you'll just travel you're like in this month i'll be in this state i'm like
potentially unavailable yeah yeah uh so once again thank you so much kimmy me sure uh
dodoke i love kim ni to doke i am an unapologetic shojo fan i'm going to give that an s
because is that this one everybody needs some like wholesome shy people
you know live their lives and and are happy uh energy is that is that that one of the
topic that i put there um i i can't really see but let's see uh i i don't think so that looks like
chainsaw man okay is it this one there you go that i recognize that that's okay that's
kim ni to doke it's very okay chainsaw man slow burn shojo oh chainsaw man is really good uh
yeah i i would i would put that as an s oh wow i'm getting a lot of s's um i either love something
or i've never seen it yeah i hate it stains gate oh i've never seen that one but i've heard
like really good things so i'm going to give that like a b it's probably like an a if i have seen
it but i have not okay um or rimo um he wrote or no imoto ga konami kawaii wake ga nai i don't know

because most of these are um s tier uh if you could what's your favorite studio jibbly film
ooh princess mononoke is my favorite uh yeah that's that's got a lot of kami got a lot of kami in it
and uh it's it's like a little darker it's a little more sophisticated than spirit it away um but i love
i love both of them and toro yeah uh and pretty much all of the other ones but yeah princess
mononoke is my favorite a few that you didn't have on there um i would recommend uh makoto shinkais
two uh most recent films uh your name kimono nawa very shinto e and then uh weathering with you
which is also very shinto e um okay yeah okay cool he's kind of the new uh hayo musaki oh okay
interesting interesting wow oh that's that's a big that's big is he's still is uh he's still making
films musaki yeah well yes um he keeps like retiring and then doing more stuff
so um i heard that he's working on something now and then he promises he'll retire
but we'll see yeah we'll see yeah well um okay so that we've gone through a huge
like kind of crash course into shinto um so many more questions i'd love to get to you with
and i might just drop them in with some of the audience questions but um i really wanted to
touch on you know the religiosity of japan as well as the influence of shinto which is
really arguably your expertise um so i'll ask a few of those questions but um it might be good to
jump into the um q and a from the audience so we had di who said is the ancestor worship in uh shinto
yes there is there is ancestor worship in in shinto um however a lot of the ancestor worship
today is kind of rooted through a buddhist ritual tradition rather than than shinto tradition
shinto tends to focus on like this worldly life that we're in now and then after that buddhism
kind of takes over but there are shinto traditions for for folks after they die
and uh some some kami are also ancestral as well so yes uh ancestor worship is part of shinto
but i wouldn't say that shinto is ancestor worship the same way i wouldn't say it is uh nature
religion um but those are two components uh that make up shinto yeah yeah uh i think it
was in the series that you did it's it's the old saying people are born people in japan are born
shinto and di buddhist um yeah that's that's generally true today yeah cool uh thanks for the
answer there interesting um there isn't any obvious connection i was wondering that since um masquerade
is shown on dogu figurines perhaps there wasn't influence on later rights oh masquerade
masquerade hmm i'm not quite sure um but i'd love to look into that more so uh feel free to email me
uh yes please give kaitlyn more homework uh how did buddhism affect the shinto religion
or didn't it um a lot um so i a short answer is check out the video that i did for religion
for breakfast um about you know what's the history of of buddhism and shinto it's an over
1000 year long relationship between buddhism and shinto uh so when buddhism came in uh as we
mentioned in the you know the sixth century that kind of started a conversation where they were like
okay we have these deities from outside we have the deities that we already worship here what's
their relationship and lots of people had lots of the answers for that over time um and sometimes
people said oh well buddhas are just foreign kami and then later people said kami are just
manifestations of the buddhas and then they went back and said no the buddhas are actually
kami like the kami started and then they went everywhere else and then they came back as the
buddhas so there's kind of been a a fight for supremacy um but historically speaking buddhist
temples and shinto shrines were very related in fact a lot of times they were on the same ground
so we would call them temple shrine complexes and so buddhist priests might be uh or monks
might be performing rituals for the kami shinto priests might be you know doing stuff related to the
buddha um this is why uh there was a lot of like syncretism between buddhism and shinto uh and
that's the short answer okay so yes it affected shinto shinto affected buddhism there's a whole thing
yeah yeah i i love that they seem to commingle so well like you'd never i don't know you might
actually but you'd never really see like a mosque and a and a synagogue next to each other like
it's sharing the same complex where maybe you do yes but you do but you do but you do see
that within you know shinto and buddhism it's like yes we have seen that historically um in the the
meiji period which i mentioned earlier so basically like in the middle 1800s the government
like made a law that the the buddhist temples and the shinto shrines had to be separated so that
separation was very violent because they had been commingling for so long and actually it led
to a lot of violence against buddhist temples and monks and they burned things down and they like
melted um bells to make like guns and stuff like that um and there was also like a lot of fighting
between buddhist monks and shinto priests historically and i'm i'm not gonna like get too far into that
so it's always been kind of a tense relationship between buddhism and shinto
but they have been interrelated and there isn't like a an exclusionary relationship between them
you can do shinto and buddhist things yeah sure uh i'm gonna get you to read this question
because i'm gonna pronounce everything wrong ah okay that's fine so uh p says asks amaturasu as
dainichi nyorai which is the solar buddha uh what does that speak on shinto's ability of
assimilation at least before the meiji era before state shinto came along thanks yeah okay so this is
a really complex question uh we i do talk about this a little well uh andrew mark henry who's the host
of religion for breakfast talks about this using my words um uh in uh several of the videos so yes
amaturasu the shinto kami was related to or said to be like a manifestation or an avatar of the
solar buddha dainichi nyorai um so this is part of the syncretism between buddhism and shinto um there
was this idea in in um japanese buddhism called honji suijaku which means uh the the roots and the
traces so basically there was a very uh fairly dominant idea in medieval japan that uh the kami were
actually the local manifestation of buddhas from from elsewhere and so they said oh well amaturasu is a
sun deity she's an avatar or a manifestation of the solar buddha um this was a very popular idea at uh
some really important buddhist temples and shinto shrines we even see this idea at ise which is a
complex of shrines that are dedicated to amaturasu and other really important deities but the inner shrine
of ise um is is like the main shrine of amaturasu we even see this idea of a dainichi nyorai uh there
so what does that speak on shinto's ability of assimilation um priests you know like buddhas and if
we can call them shintoists during the medieval period although that's really debatable uh had a lot of
different ideas about how they were interrelated uh there was kind of a reverse movement a reverse
honji suijaku where some people said actually amaturasu is the start and you know the solar buddha
is the manifestation of her elsewhere so there's like a lot of power plays um so i wouldn't say it's
assimilation um but it's what my uh polygon advisor fabiel rambelli calls a combinatory paradigm
so they're combined in different ways and there's kind of like a push and pull back and forth
between different ideas um prior to state shinto yeah i'm gonna stop wow
we've been talking so much history i i promise i'm an anthropologist so good this is this is so good
this is such a good uh i guess jumping off point for a lot of people because they'll hear
something that catches their attention and they're like what is that and then like it's a giant
invent you know trip to wikipedia and then hopefully to some books um to find out more and to your series of
course yes anybody would like to learn details send me a message i'll i'll i'll give you a book
recommendation awesome awesome uh how does shinto deal with morality oh um
as opposed to other religions yeah yeah so we've talked a little bit about uh purity and pollution
and how certain um acts that are like uh against social norms or you know against uh uh the the norms of
the the kami as well when those are violated um bad things happen so you could you know kind of
talk about that in terms of morality um but generally speaking shinto doesn't have like a
code of morals that you must follow there's no like 10 commandments there's no like people are
innately good or evil or anything um it's really just about like ritual relationships with the kami
and um depending on how those go good things or bad things can can happen um bad things can happen
to good people good things can happen to bad people so there isn't really like a uh a moral doctrine
involved with shinto but shinto priest will tell you like don't be a jerk try to be harmonious
yeah yeah don't kill people uh that's a taboo with so this is a question i always get asked since
um if i'm having conversations with um my religious friends is they say where do you get
your morality from because i'm no longer a christian yeah where does a shinto priest get their morality
from is that is there like cultural norms or or have they got other belief systems or
is all of japan utilitarian or like like how does like like um yeah like how
i mean there are there are some ideas of morality um baked into to shinto traditions
that have kind of come through the centuries even shinto mythology um you know we talked
about izanagi and izanami um before they have children there's this moment where they're trying
to decide how they relate to each other um izanami the woman speaks first and then they have uh
a disfigured child so then they decide oh the man needs to speak first and then they have a
an able child and then they decide that's good um so you know you can you can pull uh moral lessons
out of some of the stuff you know living in harmony with nature um not killing people is like an actual
taboo in in shinto for example uh you can pull morality out of that but i would say that most of
the morality of of shinto priests and and other folks in japan um comes from you know social norms or
from buddhism has more you know doctrine that explicitly tells you like you should do this you
should not do that or this is the way that you should live your life um so so yeah shinto is not
too overly concerned um with with morality yeah this is this is what i was hoping and also
fearing is that a lot of the presuppositions that i would go into this conversation with wouldn't
necessarily be relevant it's like it's like i'm not even i i'm not even it's hard because it's like
i'm not even asking the right questions like it's you need to you need to think very differently
about about you do that's why it's so fun yeah yeah that's my experience um but yeah most of the
questions that we come you know equipped with like all right i'll you know ask these five like who's
the founder when did it start uh a lot of the times i'm just like i don't i don't know
sorry yeah uh you know there's a lot of room it's just just like the gods they just appeared it just
appeared yeah um take it as red this is a quish question that i really wanted to know about um
are there shinto superstitions concepts or ideas that are prevalent in modern western culture
that i've like maybe trickled in and modern western culture okay so i have to do the
religious studies uh scholarly say yeah the preamble say that uh oh keep it short i promise no no
so superstition is often set apart from religion and that like religion is this codified thing that
society has agreed upon is like an okay tradition right more or less um superstition is somehow
like bad and anti-modern and like a holdover from ancient times that we should like get rid of you
know this is kind of like baked into conceptions of modernity uh and what it needs to be like a
modern civilization so there's a lot of baggage with the term superstition right uh sorry all words
are bad that being said um there's not really a lot of superstition that uh or you know ideas about
things that will happen that have come over from shinto yeah i mean when you go to a shinto
like if you're a tourist and you go to a shinto shrine you might pick up an oma mori which is
like a protective amulet that you're supposed to carry on your person um i have one in my backpack
actually i have a few in my backpack people keep giving them to me they're really fun to collect
um so some people yeah i gotta catch them all uh oma mori definitely i have a video about
oma mori if anybody wants to learn more about those um but uh people don't tend to hear about
shinto much at all in in the west i think what we hear about more is uh yokai or these like
supernatural creatures that are sometimes related to shinto and sometimes are just part of
like japanese folklore um so you might hear about like fox spirits or raccoon dogs called
tanuki um they're not actually raccoons and they're not actually dogs but that's how we translate
tanuki um so you might hear about some of those but no i don't think a lot of superstition has
has come over um from japan but i hope people learn more about yokai and shinto and uh i'm always
surprised by like what people pick up from from anime so maybe more is coming over okay i got um i
someone suggested i grabbed this book yokai attack um oh yeah yokai attack is really fun hiroko yoda and
and matt all are are fantastic i would also recommend the yokai books by uh zak davison uh he's a
friend of mine he's a folklore expert comic book geek uh writer um he actually wrote zak davison
um he actually writes uh demon days with peach momoko i've been uh chronicling their series so if
you want to learn more about yokai and zak davison's work check out my videos about uh demon days
now they have a second series i haven't made the videos yet for called demon wars that's more fun
um yes zak davison has written several books about yokai um there's one about yude there's one about
like cat spirits um he's done a lot he's also worked on star wars i mean what doesn't he do
uh he he's also a translator he's worked on um gegegen o kitaro uh like spooki uh kitaro is a very
popular manga and anime that he has translated um and then like kind of the og yokai scholar who
you can read is uh michael dylan foster okay there's more there's like a bunch of people about
yokai uh that's a good place to start if you do um have a reading list on your website
something i'll post it in the um in the chat down below so people can oh yeah i did have a good
read i've kind of fallen off with update oh but i i'm the one he suggested you get the good
reads years ago i was like yeah i need to know what you're meaning uh i will update it at some
point i can't tell you um but the videos that i have about yokai so far also have reading lists
in the video description so cool awesome okay we'll do uh so uh let's wrap up the interview
with two of the questions i always ask most most of the guests unless it's inappropriate uh first one
is because we talk a lot about religion and obviously you're a presbyterian uh but you also
study shinto what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in
oh that's hard it's a hard one right because the most plausibly true religion that you
don't believe in um i feel like i have to say shinto i feel like you can practice shinto
and do no harm and live oh yeah but also buddhism yeah okay cool maybe maybe that
shinto buddhism syncretism is is pretty alright i do i do like uh i'm not sure if this is mainstream
but i do like the buddhist concept of hell which is which is that when if you go to hell it's like
it's it's a temporary place to burn off your car yes and then and then you go back to enlightenment
you get enlightened after it but it's like you can you can get out of it yeah which is a nice nice
kind of hell i have some videos on on several there are many buddhist hells um i have some videos
about some of them coming up oh wow your channel is gonna blow up it's gonna be awesome um
when i when i find time when you have time yeah uh so uh last question uh if you could choose
a religions afterlife and then afterlife would immediately become true what would you choose
as an anthropologist as an anthropologist i don't know i'm like really attached to christian heaven
personally yeah yeah no i get it um but uh the pure land in terms of um like pure land buddhism
seems like pretty good so is that better than i don't even know about what that is what is about
like non-existence oh that's a rabbit hole that we don't have time to go over okay next time um uh we'll
do that next time or if you if you got time to come on once again you're always welcome um
it's been a lovely conversation but i just want to shout out uh your stuff once again everyone go
