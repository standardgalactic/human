Hey everybody, welcome to Deep Drinks podcast, the deepest podcast on the internet.
Should we deep platform people with harmful ideologies?
Does social ostracization help stop the spread of harmful ideas or cannot leave those ideas
unchallenged making them worse?
What if we did not deep platform anyone with vulnerable community members have to deal
with more hate than they already do?
Do harmful ideas spread quicker and more quickly and larger?
Today we aim for an open dialogue to discuss these important issues.
I'm delighted to introduce Chrissy Hansen, an independent researcher with a talent for
contributing thought-provoking articles to various academic journals.
Chrissy has a strong passion for New Testament scholarship and is particularly interested
in the Christ myth debate.
She is a proud Norse pagan, bringing a unique perspective to her work.
Chrissy describes herself as on the radical left.
She played a part in bringing to light some of the unsavory opinions of Dr. Robert Price.
We started our friendship when we got into a little bit of a Twitter spat and Chrissy
was kind enough to jump onto a phone call with me in which we ended up becoming buddies
by the end I would say and we ended up talking for an hour and a half and the conversation
was so good that I invited her on to continue the conversation here on Deep Drinks.
So today we're discussing should we deep platform harmful ideologies?
Welcome Chrissy Hansen.
Hi.
Thanks for coming on.
Thanks for having me.
I'm always excited to talk about controversial things and get myself in trouble.
Yeah, let's both get cancelled today.
Like on different sides of the aisle.
So before we jump into it, we were going to drink orange juice but we had some issues
grabbing some.
So what are you drinking today?
I'm drinking my favorite canned water, Dasani.
You.
Dasani.
It is excellent if you want a water that tastes like the bottle it comes in.
Oh awesome, that's fantastic and I've got some orange juice which I'm lucky I had a roommate
run out and grab it for me but otherwise I would have been in the same situation.
So before we jump into the conversation, can you just talk a little bit about what kind
of scholarship that you're kind of doing and like how you kind of got involved in the scholarship
side of things.
So I find that super interesting.
Yeah, so I got involved in doing academic scholarship while still doing my undergraduate.
I just recently graduated.
I began primarily with interests in biblical scholarship.
I got into that at the time actually because I was dating a pastor's daughter and the pastor
happened to have a PhD in Old Testament from the University of Chicago.
So I was very influenced by him and I became particularly interested in Deuteronomy 32
8-9 which for people who don't know it's a whole passage that's debated upon for its
very clear in my opinion leanings towards polytheism and the indication that Yahweh
was not among the was not the highest God in the pantheon at one point in Israel's history.
And so I started getting into writing on that subject.
It did not end up being my first article published though.
My first articles were all on the Christ myth debate which I got into mostly because I found
a whole lot of things to be really bad.
It's like that.
There's so much drama in the myth.
We said we're not going to talk about mythosism.
There's so much drama in that area of the internet right now.
I'm just I'm staying out of it watching from a distance with popcorn but but staying out
of it myself.
Yeah.
My current research is going into other topics now I'm I've got an article that should be
coming out soon on whether or not we should accept the story of Jesus being baptized by
John the Baptist as historical.
I'm arguing in the negative and I've also started work on the question of whether or
not the epistle to Philemon is authentic.
In addition to that I now have I have an article published just a few months ago on Tacitus
is Annals 1544 which is the famous passage that talks about Christianity and Jesus and
also the Neuronian persecution and the great fire and in that article I contend that Tacitus
actually can't be considered an accurate source for the Neuronian persecution and in fact he's
probably partially inventing that narrative for his own political purposes.
Yeah.
And following that I also have a sequel coming out fairly soon which is going to be specifically
whether or not the Neuronian persecution happened at all and I'm arguing against that and there's
one more I have submitted right now which is arguing that Paul was never murdered.
Paul was never murdered.
A specific favorite of mine.
That's super interesting and can people read your work if they go to the link that I just posted?
Yeah you can go there and you can shoot me emails I'm happy to help out some of them are
not open access but most of the stuff I publish I try to publish open access so that people can
just really read everything.
Yeah it's super super interesting you must have you must get to do so much research just
and and not be kind of pigeonholed in because you're not like you know you're not with the
universities here you can just study kind of what you want to study which is really cool.
Exactly I don't have any limitations and so I get to just do whatever is currently on my
hobby horse schedule which also means I get to research a whole lot of other side topics
while doing this and I also through various networks can get access to a whole bunch of
really fun articles in different languages as well so you won't be surprised to find
my articles have citations to Chinese academic work and Japanese work and especially also Soviet
scholarship I'm very specifically interested in the Soviets and their work on early Christianity
as well so a lot of that appears throughout my work.
It's it's really cool I'm very impressed let me just say that you just published so much
and so niche of a field as well for a non-doctor in the field you know like that's so cool.
Yeah and I have also published outside of New Testament as well I've published an article on
JR Tolkein and his instantiation and conception of gender in Middle Earth specifically through
the lens of the mass of spiders in his world and Goliath and Shilab.
No way that's so cool the more I learn about you the more interested I get yeah.
And then I also I also published an article oh I was just saying I saw somewhere that you were
like Pagan and I was like you're Pagan like a message I was like you're Pagan you're like yep
North Pagan I'm like damn like you just get more interesting the more I learn about you.
Yeah and I'm actually I've also published an article on the grievance studies affair which was
a hoax that a bunch of right-wingers set up to try and make feminist journals look bad.
They would essentially just send hoax papers over there and say look how bad their standards are.
So I did an article on that I also did I've been doing work as well on a 19th century and early
20th century Christian movement a millenarian movement called the Pentecost bands they were
an out shoot of the radical holiness movements and also an offshoot of the free Methodist Church
directly. Interesting yeah there's um I've got I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to
bug you for some of your papers I mean that aren't unless I can get them
open access because it'd be super interesting to read about this stuff.
Well getting into the conversation that we're here to kind of talk about is the
concept of platforming indeed platforming. I am here to learn as well as to play devil's advocate
and to try and challenge your ideas I hope your ideas challenge me I'm hoping that at the end of
this you know I have a better understanding of the reasons for and against because like I'm still
there's still areas of it where I'm kind of I'm constantly learning and debating and I saw that
amazing piece by Contra points on JK Rowling that that actually shifted my opinion a little bit
and I've had some conversations with friends as well so what I want to do is everyone answer
the question into the chat right now and then we're going to re-answer the question at the end
we're going to re-pose the question at the end and see if anyone's shifted in their opinion.
Should we de-platform harmful ideologies so just put a yes or a no in in the chat or maybe we can
do should we do like a zero to ten um ten being absolutely yes zero being no um no we shouldn't
de-platform maybe we could do something like that I think zero would be more would be really
interesting to do yeah okay let's do zero to ten so zero um is no we shouldn't de-platform
harmful ideologies and ten is yes we should um de-platform harmful ideologies cool so Kerry
answers ten we should definitely de-platform harmful ideologies uh and and the people who promote them
and so or if you don't want to write it down just remember your answer and then we'll you know see
for it just by the end of this because because to be honest I'm not sure where I can't kind of well
actually let's let's let's let's hold out let's hold both have each a file where do you stand on
that question if it's zero um I'm I'm around an eight an eight okay and between an eight and a nine
um I do think that there should we'll get into this I do think that there might be a little leeway
on occasion um yeah I I'm actually not that I know I'm I'm worried that we might be in alignment a
little bit um I I would say that I'm close I'd probably say maybe maybe I'm gonna say probably
six or seven so like just a little bit over a little bit over the hut like the on the fence
like towards favor of um of de-platforming um and the reason the and the reason for me that I'm
I'm on that on that side is because something that was pointed out to me is I stand in a very
strong place of privilege I'm an assist white heterosexual person who doesn't have to deal with
like I have a debate with someone it's like a fun chess game for me but for the people who on the
people who are watching who may be um of the topics I'm debating with I'm debating with a
homophobe or I'm debating with um a racist or something for them there's real world consequences
to the to the the the the changing zeitgeist of the ideas um so um so that's why I lean a bit
more towards the platform because I recognize my privilege there so I guess um should we start with
talking about how this all came about or should we jump into just talking about the subject um
I'm I'm fine with either or okay well um so I let's talk about let's let's give you a
let's give a bit of history first so do you want to so historically how we became associated online
is you tweeted to me because I was having uh Elliott Saxton on the channel and Elliott Saxton
was doing some stuff like he was he looked like he was being friendly with Robert Pryce
and Robert Pryce um and he was defending Robert Pryce was he or something I can't really remember
yeah so yeah the situation with Elliott at the time um he's supposed reportedly getting better
about this so Lee leeway um but at the time um Elliott and I had interacted a few times um I had
specifically tried he had first reached out to me over email um and asked me to come on his show
I took a look at his channel Robert Pryce was on there I have a uh pretty no tolerance policy
when it comes to Robert Pryce for the most part and I didn't want to really be associated
so I told him I wouldn't come on um and then months passed uh uh at this point I was admin
I became an admin for a historical Jesus Facebook group um still admin over there I do ban hammer
so okay um and at that point uh there was a some showdown going on in the mythic circles because
practically every single person who's in the mythicist camp is problematic at least like the
big names are um in some capacity so I put out a statement that I was not going to be going on
uh channels that were um going to be platforming certain figures
and Elliott chimed in on it he uh wasn't too keen on that stance that I took
and I brought up uh hey um you realize the people you have on your channel are
really sketch like you've had bob price bob price is on record on a live stream saying
that he thinks it would be okay to shoot 10 year olds who are in a riot
um in addition to the other uh comments that he's made yeah on top of that he also had other
characters like Robert Spencer this is not to be confused with a different well-known
Spencer who is also a nationalist wait so it's not the popular not the popular no it's not it's not
our favorite one who got punched in the face unfortunately it's a different one who's very
similar to dusting um this robert spencer is an anti-muslim uh apologist he writes hate
screed books um promoting all sorts of violent propaganda about them uh he is his work is the
favorite of some particular mass shooters who cite him in their manifestos yeah is it like the
um he's banned from entering the he was also banned from entering the uk for associating with white
nationalists not see another nationalist or other way supremacist nationalist movements it's wild um
and these are the people that elliot was having on his channel right and it also had
then another guy uh ralph ellison there as well who is an open racist and misogynist it's it was
becoming a pattern yeah um and so i told him i i don't really want to hear about it and so
several of us began not associating with elliot over it elliot uh then sent me a facebook message
he tried to apologize to me and then had ralph ellison again so i didn't take his apology i
did not take his apologies as meaningful um because he obviously wasn't learning and then after that he
was talking about wanting to set up a go fund me for a bob price after all this was going down
so then i saw elliot was appearing on your channel so i was trying to get your attention
multiple times actually about that and then it came on through twitter i i had tagged you on a
twitter post uh specifically with all the stuff about elliot and shannon q got on there and a
bunch of others who know me um for those that don't know i kind of just exist in the undertow of the
community and yeah i kind of am acquainted with just about everyone yeah um at some point every
everyone meets me and knows what i do i know on top of this i've also garnered a reputation
right after the david fox situation for dredging up dirt um i i i helped dredge up
the fact that david fox was using like vanity presses to publish his monograph and other
stuff like that and uh also i um ousted his discord server um and a bunch of the misogynistic
and homophobic stuff that was going on in there as well yeah um lesson uh sometimes you might want
it if you're a bigot you might want to keep your discord private so yeah so uh and so you
reach out to me and look i get a lot of messages i i get you should see some of the mental illness
that comes dripping through the comment section on both twitter and youtube and like some of the
stuff i get is just wild so when i got your messages i had no idea who you were um and
yet i was just like i saw your messages i was like what what i'm like i'm like this and i went on to
ali's channel and i saw he did an apology saying hey i didn't realize the harm it was you know having
robert on and blah blah i'm not gonna associate with him anymore blah blah and i was like oh cool
like he's he's put it to the but also i i was like he's not robert price he's a person associated
with robert price and he's apologized for that association and i'm just having him want to talk
about something completely separate so i didn't think it was that big of a deal but um but we
ended up getting into a bit of a twitter thing um people were like you know i think you know people
like be careful um you know shonen q's like if um if if christy says something i listen and i was
like oh geez i was um being cancelled for all of like 30 minutes and i was like this so i i
messaged you and i was like look can we just can we just chat on a phone call because i don't i don't
want this like i like you know you can read text wrong so we ended up talking for ages and it was
good conversation um i actually had um some people uh like pull out of coming onto deep
things because of that conversation i've since messaged me actually this morning and said
you know i'm happy to come on again i understand your perspective but i think what got me into
actually when i had when i had um i think when i had ali it on i got there was like comments from
ge's partner i think it's katlyn saying like i wouldn't harbour someone on that's a nazi or
something i'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa like just in the comment section on like what's going on
this is when i first got introduced to the drama of the uh of the online like i guess pseudo politics
that goes on behind the scenes i didn't realize there's a lot of it but this is the disclaimer
that i kind of sent out um to uh to you and this is something i wrote a while ago when when i saw
Robert Price getting pulled off um myth vision and by the way great like i'm not saying i'm not
trying to defend Robert Price but i didn't know anything about it at the time i just saw a lot
of people saying he should be cancelled um and stuff like that so i was like oh damn i need to
write something i need to get my thoughts down so i wrote this down and so this is the disclaimer
that i put at the bottom of deep drinks um deep just does not endorse the fusel statements of any
guest um stars have deep deep drinks podcasts the stars have deep conversation this includes
harmful idea or do you discuss responsibly so i just want to clarify too this was my stance i'm
reworking this and this part of the reason we're having this conversation my approach uh deep drinks
is on a debate platform my goal is to provide the best faith interpretation of the guest's ideas
i can see here that could be a problem now especially if i'm giving the best faith interpretation
of like holocaust denial um or something like that um why discuss bad ideas i believe truth
christians scrutiny and harmful ideas should be discussed i worry that australization tends to
push those australized further into the heart dangerous ideologies and groups my stance so this
is just me i reject all forms of bigotry racism homophobia and transphobia and aspires partisanism
and believe that all ideas should be evaluated based on their merits i endeavor to engage in
honest discourse and will not treat um someone differently for immutable characteristics and
safe space deep drinks podcast conversations can often um distress the listeners as a result of a
subject matter mental illness religious intolerance homophobia bigotry etc and a result and as a
result view discretion is advised i do my best to give consent warnings and label episodes and help
viewers decide on which episodes to listen to so this is really important to me this last one because
i have a lot of conversations about people who deconvert and deconstruct from their faith and
part of that includes having conversations about what they went what they go through
so i could never have deep drinks as like it's a safe space for the guests but i could never have
deep drinks as a safe space for uh for everyone because people's journeys are different and if
say if i am interviewing um a sexual abuse survivor or something like that that conversation
may be very triggering to someone who's gone through sexual abuse or something like that
yeah um so that was my that was my current that was my stance and the current disclaimer for deep
drinks but but for for but i'm hoping that i can i can develop those ideas a little
little more through this conversation so what are your thoughts should we do platform harmful
ideologies what are the pros and the cons for doing that in your mind i think there are several
reasons why we probably should um i think it also depends on the nature of the person it gets a little
bit uh tricky so just like some more general arguments from a practical standpoint i actually
don't think that debates like having uh debates on these different ideologies and ideas actually
work in the majority of cases i don't think that they're actually very productive um what we have
found is the cases when people have deeply held beliefs the more you challenge them the more
you entrench them actually um so for instance several studies have been done on um uh vaccine
deniers like anti-vaxxers and how presenting them with the evidence presenting them with why
those views are just scientifically you know hokum aren't they they don't stand up
actually just further entrenched them in their beliefs against vaccines
well that's that that's a problem with all that's a problem with um yeah well and it's
the same thing we've also found in religious studies as well as the more you challenge believers
on their belief in god and stuff the more entrenched they become in that and i think that
this is specifically the case when we have very deeply held ideologies that are also very hateful
because usually those ideologies that are are expressly hateful like
being anti trans in the current climate going on about you know trans people are predators and
stuff like that uh comes from a place of viewing them as a threat and there's no and you're not
going to be able to get them to stop viewing trans people as a threat even if you convince them
that you aren't personally that's not going to change how they view the majority because
they can always compartmentalize the an individual they will not they aren't here to compartmentalize
a majority yeah i i would agree with that that you're not changing the person you're debating
is mine but i i would push back a little bit and say let's say you have like 15 year old
bob and bob doesn't know which site he kind of comes down on uh are you okay that it looks like
it's your interest there can you hear me stop yeah yeah i can hear you um yeah it's my laptop
froze up for some reason uh okay um so um it looks like you're very tired and bored of the
conversation so oh no it's good so i was just gonna say like it's like as i'm talking you're
just like this is boring yeah i'll i'll try and get this worked out as we go awesome so so let's
say we have like little jimmy right and jimmy's like 15 and he doesn't know where he stands on
on the conversation um the by watching a debate he can kind of see i guess both sides nut out
their ideas and someone being held accountable and holding their feet to the fire so a great example
of this is um because what we spoke in our previous conversation that it's really a better
thing to do is create like a video essay and like pull apart someone's idea through a video essay or
some sort of publication that just just attacks their idea but doesn't give them the opportunity
to like spread misinformation um so we could talk we could talk about um nazis we could talk about um
transgender identity one of the big things that i see is a problem today um it is a problem with
this is you get things like um matt fucking walsh which is he's sorry it's saying his name is like
voldemort to me i i fucking hate that person to my core um just he's such a piece of shit bad
faith actor sorry a little triggered that but he he um he creates this documentary what is a woman
and in it is just this is dripping with um you know uh it's it's doing exactly what a
propaganda documentary piece is supposed to do and it's incredibly convincing to almost everyone
who watches that who doesn't come in with a preconceived idea if matt walsh was to actually
sit and debate someone on these subjects he would fall apart in fact he even on joe rogan
joe fucking rogan got like challenged him and made him look like an idiot when talking about
homosexuality joe rogan yeah and it's like if you know if you sat got matt walsh and he got him
to sit down in the debate most people who watched that documentary and saw the dumb ideas that he
portrayed and the misinformation that he was just kind of spreading and like the message that he
was pushing out and you you would have a challenge so you'd get all of his little followers coming
along and um you know going like oh this is going to be exciting and we're going to see matt walsh
like totally smash this lefty and then you see them you'd see matt walsh get torn apart he won't
do debates because this is exactly why he won't do debates because his ideology will fall apart
and he's motivated to keep it the way it is uh so yeah that's the that's that's an issue I see
with the the idea of not because I think that debate debates do influence like there's um
I know you're not a huge fan but destiny often says that um you know there's 20 percent of people
on either side there's like 20 percent of people on each side of the fence that will be swayed with
the opinion and then there's like the rest of people who would just always go for their team
but it's that 20 in the middle on either side that you're hoping to sway with good arguments
and I've definitely seen um destiny like come up against some like extremely bad people like um
right wing nationalists and and um and you know nick fuentes and kind of just wipe the floor with
them and do radicalize a lot of people um but on the other side you're kind of spreading their
message a little bit to people who have no idea what they're talking about yeah and I think this is
also it's easy for destiny and people like destiny or people like wash to say things like that because
they also aren't doing that many like comparatively they aren't doing that that many formal debates
on these topics instead what they're doing is they're usually just arguing with some random person
they find and the average random person doesn't know how to actually do a debate they don't know
they don't because debates are primarily first and foremost an art of rhetoric they are not
factual showcases of reality and they're not meant to be this is not where you go to cite papers
and this is not where you go to give a lengthy analysis and spiel of a specific passage somewhere
and the evidence for why an interpretation is correct this is where you go to specifically
try and formulate the best talking points that make your case convincing to an audience
and that is where things actually are very different while destiny will have some more
success because he's largely arguing with nobodies who can't actually effectively argue back
this is a very different case when you're arguing with someone who's actually going to be
debating from a position of being trained this is why Ben Shapiro actually does really well
Ben Shapiro is was groomed to be a to the stage he knows exactly how to make someone look like
a fool with rhetoric that's why you constantly can find these Ben Shapiro owns people with
backs and logic compilations and stuff like that or Miley Annopoulos was the same way before he got
ousted sorry have you seen Milo's sodomy clock you've seen that
no he's got like a little clock he's he's recently converted to Catholicism and
become non gay and kicked his husband out of his house and stuff and when he said become
non gay he's not actually non gay but he's got this clock that he posts he's like it's been
a thousand days since I've done sodomy and you're like this is the wildest thing I've ever seen
someone post online like I'd rather see watching someone do sodomy than see a sodomy clock like
what is that that's so weird anyway he's walking self parody at this point he really is yeah but
no this is and we also see this in like the atheist community people like Richard Dawkins people like
Sam Harris are raw and others are very good rhetoricians an excellent at doing a debate and
making people who are on the other side look pretty foolish really quickly
it's it is an art form the problem and this is why I don't like debates is that not everyone
has that art form so what while it's you know cool and great for us when we can find the the
Nazi that doesn't have that and that's effective for us it's also quite consistently the case
that there are people on our side who also can get shown up pretty easily and in fact we've seen
that is seen that be the case with people like Vosh actually there are occasions where he just
does not do well in a debate at all there's other times where he just makes himself look
pretty awful there are times destiny hasn't done well in debates and I'm pretty sure destiny is
more than happy to admit to a number of them and that's because
there's also levels of that art form some people like Vosh and destiny are not used to debating
people who are much more formal or from a more trained perspective people who really really
know how to debate really well are Vosh and destiny are are not used to dealing with those
people they primarily deal with random people who have never debated in their lives so it stands
then that people on your side there's just as much likelihood that you can come across people who
are also going to look completely foolish and then also on top of this is that and this is
particularly a danger for people who are trying to be you know really intellectually honest and
trying to make really good cases against hateful ideologies is that we also have to deal with the
fact that we can't always deal with all the arguments that they offer all the time so for example
say that they bring up some kind some very very
for why they thought we should I don't know endorse eugenics some awful thing but they bring up some
very very very specific cases that you can't really put to because you don't know the specifics
that they're getting into at that point they've effectively won the rhetorical debate because
you can't offer a rejoinder you can't refute them and in the public sphere that's all that that they
see yeah so actually what it does is even if you're a trained debater and you know what to do
you open them up you open your audience up that is to seeing that maybe you're wrong because we
don't always have the ability to just think things through all the way and think about why maybe
something's wrong or why we shouldn't grant x points or why we shouldn't give this amount of
leeway to our opponents in a debate and this means that they can if you're not careful very very
quickly take the rope out of your hands and yeah and yeah exactly um that's why that's actually
sorry to bring this up again but this that's actually why I um what did I where did I write it
yet I wrote discussed responsibly here because I think it would be um it would be it's it's all I
would say it's always a bad idea to bring on someone when you're not equipped to challenge
their ideas so I would almost not have a problem and I know this this is gonna sound um
this is gonna sound weird um this is gonna sound bad but I would not almost not have a problem
bringing on someone as despicable at well I I don't want to hurt that I don't want I don't want
deep drinks to um I don't know if I would but let's say let's say it wasn't deep drinks because I
don't want to like I liked I want deep drinks to be like a safe happy place for everyone but
I would not be have a problem with discussing with Bob Price or someone as despicable as that
their ideas not around Jesus myth theory or anything like that or or any of their political
ideologies yeah I'd like to I'd like to sit down and challenge them on that because I firmly believe
that um Bob Price is wrong and I firmly believe that his just watches way too much Fox News and
he honestly he must just watch so much Fox News just the talking points that he has um his favorite
was Tucker Carlson oh really yep yeah okay so there you go so there you go so um so and I'd like
to sit down and just you know have a conversation um with this person um and not even a conversation
but just challenge them on their ideas I know my friend uh Hanny from critical faculty did the
same thing he was good friends with Bob Price he bring him on and he challenged me well he told me
he challenged him why did you you know why do you think this why do you think this why do you
think this and kind of how he speaks the fire on some of the deplorable things that um he said
in saying that there's a problem too of let's say I was to bring on let's say let's say um we had a
funny message by the way um from Andrew what 15 year old is named Bob that's so good or Keith
I have a friend called Keith and he's like I'm just being set up for when I'm an old man
but um so let's say let's say Bob let's say 15 year old Bob he's um he's now what what is a woman
and he's like a full-blown transferb he loves Ben Shapiro he loves Matt Walsh he loves Jordan
Peterson and he just loves being transphobic and homophobic and um everyone knows this about him
he's quite he's quite popular online for his transphobic takes he's now 16 and um I decided
to bring him on but I don't decide to talk about any of those those subjects I just talk
to talk to him about like Warhammer 40k or like Dungeons and Dragons or video games or
something completely irrelevant in sports the problem with that then is you're kind of sanitizing
the person you're taking someone who's seen in the public eye as like a negative person
someone you shouldn't be associated with and you're kind of sanitizing them making them
appear human um which they are human but it makes them it kind of it makes them friendly
yeah it softens it for people who who may be on the fence about watching their content
and then it's like a it's like a gateway drug or discussing for Warhammer with uh 15 year old 16
year old Bob is uh is a gateway drug to watching their ideas and and that's the that's the thing like
you know people like um uh Hitler were incredibly rhetorically effective that's why they got so much
you know in this part of bunch of other things but they're rhetorically effective they were very
zealous and they're very um enthusiastic and they grab a lot of people's attentions and they and they
promoted extremely harmful ideas and those ideas eventually ended up in people dying many people
millions of people dying so yeah yeah like no and I think that there's other harms as well
and also things that I think there are other reasons I would also contend why we shouldn't
platform hateful ideologies for the most part for example uh aside from the fact that you
were giving them a platform and you were giving them a potential you're giving them a platform
even if you are giving that are potentially you know there to challenge them and you are you know
somewhat effective at getting debunking their views you aren't really going to probably change
the people who are already following them as per what many studies have found
like and I'm sure plenty of people are going to be like well I get emails from people from
people saying that I changed their minds okay the 10 people who emailed you great now let's talk about
the 2000 who didn't and let's talk about the potential hundreds of others that went and looked
up their channel after it is like for every single for every single person that you are saying
you changed their mind on and gave you an email there's probably 10 more that didn't
and maybe you and maybe even more than that that shifted over to him because what we also find is
that right wing um and dogmatics are far more likely to be more stringent and hard line in
those beliefs than people who are moderate or left people who are moderate or left are more
likely to actually change their minds on things yeah I mean yeah I would I would that sounds
about right this and there's so many layers to this and this is this is part of why you know
because I because I can see what you're saying so I've written down some pros and cons like
for myself yeah where I was really going with that is that essentially is that people like
that do these debates specifically don't care if they win over you know huge amounts of your
audience or anything like that they're not doing they're not there to do that what they're there is
because they is to specifically utilize your channel to get a boost for their own
because there's going to be tons of you tons of viewers of your channel who are not subscribers
of yours or who are only subscribing because they like some of the content but don't really even hold
your values which is also going to mean that their views can get spread by more of those people who
are going to be you know like retweet stuff and things like that going to click on links to their
channel and then on top of that that then builds up a their channel as a recruitment platform
and is using yours as an extension of that they don't need to care if they win to use you as an
extension of their channel and that's the thing is that you're essentially giving them exactly what
they want they want you to engage in the debate and they want you to engage in the debate because
it gives them a faux credibility it makes them it makes it seem like their ideas are worth debating
to begin with and therefore have maybe something to them which makes people want to potentially
investigate them and then it also gives them the ability to let use your channel as a potential
recruitment center and build up their own simultaneously in effect it is always a win-win
whether they lose or not because most people on the right are not going to switch their views
they don't have much of a danger of actually losing their support and they have far more
possibility of gaining more what do you like but what do you so you banned someone on twitter right
hypothetically we banned someone then they jump over to like truth social or like you
banned someone on youtube they move over to god the second bitch you and those ideas like the people
in those communities it's essentially like banning drugs and now you have to buy your weed off someone
who's also trying to get you to buy heroin and meth it's like it's like you're putting them in
a situation where even though their ideas were harmful they're putting them in a situation where
there are a lot more more harmful ideas and they fester and they grow worse what do you think about
that um and then those people sorry yeah people go and vote those people go and vote they protest
they do they like real world consequences come out of those you get the proud boys you get the
you get nazis you get um people um like uh demonstrating like yeah yep uh no um i do understand
the reservations about that but one thing that we actually have found with like deep platforming white
supremacists in the past is that actually these methods are fairly effective because what it does is
it uh disables their ability to actually organize oh yeah youtube getting like yeah there's bitube
and there's uh and there's other alt platforms and stuff like that but they don't have even a
tenth of the viewership and support that these mainline programs do you get them off youtube
you've effectively cut them off from growth they might they'll they might you know grow in
in bitube and stuff like that but they're growing among people who already agree with them instead
of people who don't agree with them that are being flipped over they aren't actually building a larger
in the grand scheme of things so recruitment base is just from their own pool instead of from the
entire pool of everyone so they actually aren't growing technically speaking and it actually they
shrink and that's why what we are effectively finding is that when you the more you deep platform
the more you try and get rid of their avenues for act for growth to outside audiences the more likely
they are to actually just start shrinking because effectively all that means is that they only have
their own communities to pull from which also then means that the people in their community who are
looking out there's there there's have I only there's only two options that happen either they
stay in the alt the right wing community or they leave it so actually the only thing that's
happening once you've deep platform that when you effectively deep platform them is that their views
die slowly bit by bit well that the they do I don't think that's true there are attempts to go
underground and there are and that is where it is also important to very specifically try and
maintain eyes on that underground because when you don't then they can fester and they can get
worse and they can spread specifically we've seen this with white supremacist movements so while
we were effective in getting rid of their public platforms and making a lot of their ideas really
distasteful to a general audience what they ended up doing was going underground and because we
didn't heed warnings from like the FBI that warrant that our police our police force was
becoming infested with them we did it because we didn't acknowledge that and do something about it
i.e. continuing to just de-platform them and getting rid of the and starting to actually
police our police in that way it means that they were able to to spread secretly essentially or
without detection that's why it's important that when we de-platform we make it a totality
we continue de-platforming we don't stop with that one person we continue we actually make it a
activism of de-platforming so that they can never build up an infrastructure
well that's the thing is like i think that that i i don't know if i agree or respectfully i don't
know if i agree with your your perspective well that in in this case because like we see people
moving over to like rumble and kick and things like that and bitchute which have less less issues
and just over just over the last six months well from july last year july last year they had rumble
had 1.6 million monthly users now at the end of the first quarter it has 31.9 million it's rapidly
growing it's growing so fast it's going to be like a competitor to youtube soon yeah the the
question is why is that happening and also who all is moving over because not all those people
moving over all right wing and no no no they're not a large a large reason why that move over
is happening is very specifically because of the collapse of other programs going on elan
you know when you when you destroy one of the largest one of the largest social networking
platforms and you essentially how lose more than half of your advertisers and your marketing and
then your community standards just go out the window people leave and then go elsewhere and so
yeah it's not surprising that some of those platforms have been built up like that the question
now is what are we going to do now that those platforms are built up we push for them to
deplatform um yeah that's the thing is that we when we deplatform with the and you point out when
we deplatform they go to other they go to other platforms and what ends up happening a lot of
the time is that we don't pursue them now it's true that you know they'll go over to true social
where nothing will ever happen to them but also when it comes to when it comes to very specifically
these right-wing social platforms like true social true social is a mess
yeah yeah it's not going anywhere uh it's it it was a it even to today it's for the most part
dead it's a being kept alive by a core contingent of supporters and it's not rapidly growing at all
it's in my knowledge um this is unlike more public platforms that are more open to other
political leanings like rumble um rumble is seeing an influx of both sides and that is
in large part because of things like twitter going down the tube yeah thank you for city films for
becoming a member for being a member and also um for the Trudeau super chat the video to stop
like video to stop the deplatform of tea drinks i i'm not getting deplatform
no so where we're i think that we should push this is that isn't not just stopping with
deplatforming them one place continuing to do it deplatforming them as much as you can
because then they cannot build up the infrastructure and that's the big problem is when they when
they're spreading is because they've built up an infrastructure and a network whereby they can
actually reach people outside of their own groups if you stop them from being able to do that or
effectively cut them off from the means to do so it kills their platform and it kills their ability
to actually grow and we do have we have effectively seen this happen where we have effectively cut
off specific uh communities and youtubers or other figures and it kills their community completely
i mean one of the most perfect examples is leafy is here um yeah created one of the
largest communities of hate on youtube and it did not take long for him to not only then lose his
popularity uh very specifically there was not debates necessary for this no one had to go debate
leafy in order to get to completely demolish his views and upturn his audience you needed
people making him look like a fool i need to push back on this because leafy is here let's say
they had he had a committed audience members who were just your young kids who liked his content
and believe in in agree with some of his like harmful ideologies right he gets banned and he
gets like he gets ostracized those people are now way more inclined to hate the people who
de-platform the little champion it depends on how that happens and also well that's probably
true for a while what ends up happening is that eventually they're still on the platform and they
need somewhere to go so they end up going to places that aren't as radical and over time they become
de-radicalized uh yeah i just by just by just by you know working with by being in other communities
that are not as toxic um yeah what we what you ended up actually seeing with leafy for instance
is his community was uh most actually turned against him because what essentially what ended
up happening um is leafy was producing tons of really crappy videos uh you know his usual content
just terrible um drama drama videos and he was uh pulling fights with tons of different youtubers
and eventually became the target of um i dubs the thing with leafy's community is that they're
primed to be you know hateful people and to uh direct that hate at people
um so what ended up happening people like i dubs came in and he very specifically you know he
did uh what he called a content cop i do not suggest watching these videos uh i dubs is
really crass to say the least lots of slurs trigger warning beyond belief but he created
a content cop on leafy where essentially he decided to just pull leafy's own tactics back
on him uh he said he opens the video like i can hardly contain myself because today
we get to bully leafy and he's just an entire video of cyberbullying where he made leafy look
absolutely ridiculous um it's always people hide behind a cartoon avatar isn't it that that
like some of the most horrible stuff you go on twitter and it's like you know my friend uh
an assessor recently got like a bunch of um a bunch of uh like yeah communist essentially
saying that ukrainians were nazis and just tweeting at her like over and over and over and over again
um that uh like thousands upon thousands she had to meet her um twitter it was like a raid um
and every one of them she showed me first with just like cartoon avatar cartoon avatar anime avatar
anime avatar like some obscure 1920s black and white photo like it's just yeah oh yeah uh i i don't
want to i don't want to hit on all those people that do that paul apologies oh no but but um
no yeah no but it's typical with like leafy right always hides their face on twitter like yeah
and yeah and that was the case with leafy and so it turned it turned his audience against him
because he you he was able to redirect that anger and that hate and now that audience is
that audience in large part went to idubbbz where they became a lot less radical than leafy would
have ever made them a lot of them went to other places what this does is when you also destroy
those communities as people diffuse because they usually rally behind these demagogues and when
the demagogue can no longer give them centralization it collapses yeah um so what do you think about
what do you think about things like street epistemology then um and yeah like you don't
do you like street epistemology or or what about like what about someone like um uh like documentary
filmmakers like um louis ferro who you know go to like the west pope aptus church and kind of
show the world what their their ideas are about
i i don't have great thoughts about uh street epistemology i don't have great associations
with it very specifically because it's all thanks it's associated in my opinion uh largely with well
uh edgelord atheists okay the most ineffective kinds of atheists and also the kinds of atheists
that also breed more bigotry um i hate to say it i but the atheist community also has a serious
problem uh with this sort of thing where they have adopted a lot of these methods that are very popular
across the board and also a lot and also a lot of here both sides kind of think
and what's actually done is the atheist community is just proliferating with right wing people in
fact when you uh i don't know how familiar you are with gamergate um yeah i know a little bit
about gamergate yeah when gamergate happened and uh there was a very specific community that was
a noticeable part responsible for its popularity among the right and it was the atheist community
people who operate who have basically primed their entire channels and their um and their work
around fighting fighting ideas uh this debate me bro attitude um and a community that has also
been primed for a long time to accept right wing talking points uh it it's it's no surprise that
the atheist community became at the center of gamergate like uh tj kirk carl benjamin you know
sargon of cod armored skeptic and a bunch of others all jumped on this
because when you go back to like the foundations of our newest atheist communities
with like the four horsemen ew what's something that we're going to find from a from three out of
four of those horsemen uh some pretty horrific right wing type ideas um you know christopher
hitchens was a pro-lifer christopher hitchens was also a promoter of virulent islamophobic
rhetoric and ideas he was also a raging misogynist richard docan's uh previous richard docan's
previously was dismissing sexual harassment out allegations that rebecca watson and others have
brought up um they called an elevator gate um and just downplaying women's experiences
um and sam harris is a race realist and has been promoting things like the bell curve and
charles murray's absolutely racist uh ideas about like iq and stuff thinking that black people just
have naturally lower iq levels and things like that it's disgusting and these were like three of the
most foundational figures of the modern athiast debate me bro kind of uh position
i i don't know i don't know too much the some of the stuff i got a i got a portrait of hitchens on
my wall but some of the stuff he said about women and um uh we're just that like there's
some of the stuff he said that was just absolutely the worst stuff of of i would expect from him
but there's other areas where i respect him i guess what it did is it is normalized all of us
and even before that um a lot of the athiast organizations that were founded like american
atheists were founded by people like madeline mario here who was a holocaust denier and worked
with white supremacist move movements and figures she was an absolutely horrible person in every
single way uh and also she was anti gay she did not like having gay men in the movement
she was also and of course you know anti semitic and a million other things and also promoted her
atheist movement as more important than civil rights she i'm not kidding would
published an article where she claimed that atheism the liberation of the mind was more important
than black people being given the right to vote that is what is and that's what's and the foundation
of tons of these different athiast movements and primed them for this sort of thing and this is why
you know we we ended up getting what we did athiast movement has a huge problem with this
and this is why yeah deep platforming is important like if i i'm going to be honest
i don't think that this would have been even remotely as bad if people like docan's harris
and hitchhens had not been given as much of a platform like that because they primed them to
want to do this sort of thing to get into this kind of fighting deep platforming does work
it does work to deradicalize it'll um i'm not saying that we shouldn't have conversations
with people and try and deradicalize people i think there are other ways of having these
conversations and things like public debates where you inadvertently turn your platforms
into recruitment centers by um example i i think everyone deserves the leeway to grow
i i'm also x far right i was raised in a fundamentalist church i was a church that was so far right
it did not condemn the westboro baptists that's how bad we were um and i've said some pretty
horrible things online as well there's some there are some things that could be dredged up on me
yeah you uh i remember you mentioned that let me just um let me just get some some thoughts
out and i've also got a huge super chat i think this is the biggest super chat we've ever had
from d who is amazing thank you so much that's a huge super chat like i really appreciate that
deep platform deep platforming is very subjective as a news editor for atheist republic
i can say we are very careful about making sure the news that we cover is authentic
and still we abandon a few countries this topic hits home for me wow yeah um no yeah it is subjective
but this is why i'm also specifically arguing that we should primarily be targeting very
specific hateful ideologies so things like well white supremacists uh i don't think that any of
them deserve a platform on any topic let me push let me let me push back on that about the white
supremacist like this is such this is bad this is going to only be bad for me this conversation
god i just just and to be clear i hate nazis and and like i think they i agree with you
but something that i have um i've had a recent uh recent concerns with is um
so like i look at i look at nazis and their political power at the moment at the moment
let's just keep it in the moment um and they're not they're nothing they're a scary group that
you know that does some dumb stuff in public but they politically they essentially have no power
anywhere in the world um well who does have power and who is influencing people for the worst
are christians and muslims like that they're that these these groups have uh have incredible
influence and although their ideas are people saying what do you talk about christians aren't
as bad as nazis i agree they're not as bad as nazis for sure but like my friend and just to
quickly shout out if you're a member of the channel you can watch the interview i did
with pepe pepe on zimmer um pepe julien on zimmer who was a is a trans activist in Uganda
they recently created a um a new bill in Uganda that um if you get caught as a serial homosexual
sexual um you get um put to death um and you can go after 10 years in prison just for being gay
he's a trans man and he's an activist and this is us drinking a shot at for me it was 2 a.m i
got up for it uh like i woke up that was very early shot time to have a shot of vodka but
that whole thing there that whole uh jeez sorry i'm i put the wrong button that whole
like situation in Uganda is there's a direct line from first colonialism they used to have
like a by-king Uganda they used to have um tribes in in and kingdoms in Uganda that had um third
genders in fact his his tribe had that third gender that and that's why he's uh um you know
a trans man like it it was it like it wasn't an issue then colonial colonialism came and
bringing in laws about sodomy and then the christian riot loves to send their um their little
missionaries over to Uganda and have like directly influenced the laws and it's christianity that
are directly influenced the laws that have created these Ugandan um laws against homosexuality
then you have Muslims who denigrate 50 percent of the world's population women are 50 percent
of the world's population and there's verses in the Quran Quran 434 that breaks the ribs of women
in china and gives them black eyes in the middle east it says you can beat your wife it tells you
to that it's incorrigible to so like in regards to like impact am i not to have like a muslim on
the channel am i not to have a christian on the channel to debate their ideas because their ideas
like christianity on a grand scheme of things christianity and islam they're incredibly more
harmful to society like who's pushing back against um pro-choice it's the christians in the um in the
us right but like the people who the pro-life is mostly christian protesting abortion clinics
even blowing up abortion clinics um who are the people fighting against women's rights it's it's
nazis sure but it's also like the majority of them are people who believe that man is the
head of the household and that men is to respect and the women are lower than that it's it's religious
ideology so it's like my channel which i talk to religion christians and muslims and religious
people like am i supposed to not have conversations with them as well because their ideas are just as
more harmful right now to a huge amount of people i don't so i don't think there's
actually a line to really cross when it comes to white supremacy i think um at least in america
and most of europe christian christianity really counts as as a white supremacist
uh
moda um white supremacy mostly actually proliferates in christian circles
of course yeah it is and so and then when we're also talking about colonialism that is a
prime feature of the colonialism is the white supremacy a prime reason for uh targeting abortion
clinics is also not targeting women's bodies and wanting to control them and also uh
targeting the ability of people of color and their reproductive choices as well
but it's also but what about i'll let you finish there uh all all of these all of those things i
think are intertwined in ways i don't think we should really be separating um the vast majority
of nazis are christians uh to say that nazi does the and when it comes to also the most
dangerous groups out here uh all like you know the republican party is virtually all christian
and they're also all the fascists um i don't think that those two can really be separated very
specifically because of the way kenny agandah rashes uh i i don't think we should very specifically
because of the way that things like fascism are oriented fascism is okay set up specifically
uh it i really suggest people read uh robert paxton's the anatomy of fascism
paxton very specifically how or i know so um stanley's um how fascism works
um very specifically building up ideals of the family things that are very important in christian
circles or um just a sec sorry or something yeah i know i noticed the ticking um
well everybody super chat your questions day i'm just so blown away that's huge super chat
thank you so much make sure you like it helps the algorithm gods um you know uh there's like um
who's at the who's the new ceo of youtube but they they sit there with a crystal ball and whoever
if the stream gets many likes they promote it more so you need to hit like on stream guys
yeah so um uh anyways robert um yeah um essentially that these things are intertwined
and in lots of and christianity has always been instrumental to the building up and the
uh infrastructure of fascism that's why nazis that create why nazis very specifically instituted
you know positive christianity and also had had very specifically required people to swear that
they believed in god and stuff in their oath um religious institutions are always very easily
abused for these kinds of measures and quite often where these ideas foster and spread because
they also allow for demagoguism very easily especially things like christianity which are
hinged on the authority of the pastor or the authority of the bishop and or the authority
of the pope it very easily allows for central singular individuals to become
um guider the the guiding element of a movement so so should we should we do the
should we de-platform christianity i i don't think we can de-platform christianity as a whole
very specifically because christianity is a not a conglomerate but i do think that we should
take care to de-platform individuals in it um individuals that are promoting you know these
hateful rhetorics um i don't think yeah of course i would yeah i wouldn't um but i wouldn't i wouldn't
say we should de-platform all christians because not all christian movements actually uphold these
institutions i'm thinking very specifically of liberation theology um you know in uh latin america
um liberation theology was heavily it was heavily influenced by marxist uh work and it became this
was associated especially with catholism but it was this very anti-authoritarian
and anti-oppression movement and also very uh communistic in a lot of what in their economic
beliefs um you also you know black black liberation theology as well here in the united
states um you also have progressive movements within christianity that and you the same thing
also applies in islam as well you have tons of different progressive is islamic movements you
have tons of muslims of different uh different sex and movements that also do not practice the
things that you describe like you know believing that your wife and things like that and i think
and it's and this is actually part of the thing that makes it makes it dangerous also
for muslims in the united states is when we treat them like they all believe things like that
no i that as a thing and i want to make this very clear too that i think most muslims are
just as hypocritical as most christians so like i'm i'm glad that they don't follow the
quran like most what are most i wouldn't describe it as hypocritical this is how
people negotiate their religion their faith um it's not hypocritical that you don't follow all
the rules of your faith no one ever does but just as just as we have every single person alive has
specific intellectual beliefs that they end up not following it's uh and especially or that they
have to find negotiations for because that's how rules work rules are i understand what you're
saying but let me rephrase it like let's say that let's say there's someone let's say bobby now he's
17 and he's written a book bob 15 17 year old bob and bob has this book and it's mostly okay like
much of it's just nonsense but most of it's okay but there's one chapter in his book where he says
hey you know what it's sometimes a good idea to beat your partner um let's not even say
wires let's let's just say partner um and let's say that there's a large majority of people who
start doing this and start beating their wives um like and partners harshly uh and then bobby
wants to come on my channel and talk about how good his book is like that will be similar to a
muslim coming on and talking about how much um they love the Quran most people who read bobby's
book don't care about that that chapter and i'm not going to take it like take it seriously but
there are a large majority of people who do who do take the Quran 434 seriously and do beat their
partners there is a large majority of christians who do believe that the men is the head of the
household and that um gay people should be um uh are in abominations i'm an evening i'm an
steve ryan and these people i would actually contend against that though actually statistics
show that most christians don't think that most christians do not admit most christians do not
think that gay people are the worst thing on her are in abomination um most christians i don't think
that uh but it's not a majority it's not a majority anymore actually lgbtq uh very specifically
more like get acceptance of gay people and gay relationships has actually hit majorities in
most amer in america and in most european countries that i know of
um sans a couple that we could probably name like russia but don't you see is like that's the
driving force behind the ideology like the driving force behind someone hating gay people is not
just that they hate gay people randomly it's that they've been taught by that their bible is the
inspired word of god and it says that it's an abomination for a man to lie with another man
for a lot of people yeah but there are also other groups that also do not approve of this
either um and who are not pulling from the bible for this i can actually specifically point to
atheist movements that did yeah i know that there's i know of course very specifically on
principles of things like eugenics and stuff like that um yeah i thought it was like a betrayal of
the race something to not yeah just for disgusting and stupid but like i just don't see how we can um
we can like i can take such a harsh stance against something as deplorable as um
nazis or homophobia or transphobia i don't want to have any of these people on my channel anyway
but it's like if like a trend well it's hard to say transphobia so people seem to like it's
actually people there are real well things happening to that group of people which is horrible
i think it's also worth noting that there are some well particular differences um very specifically
um while we may have contentions about things that are in the Quran and and stuff like that um
you know and we can also say same thing of the bible the bible also advocates some pretty
horrendous things as well slavery uh yeah slavery uh just all kinds of violence against women is
driven throughout um i think that the same cannot be said that the people who necessarily believe
those religions are going to believe those things and then on top of that when it comes to at least
like here in the united states with muslims the vast majority of muslims are also not
mandating that anyone else obey these things which is also starkly different than what we're
going to get over in white supremacist circles and also with christians who are mandating a
theocracy a fascistic theocracy well what about if like there was a nazi who just liked the
socialism part of the you know the the nazi regime like he did he's like ah i'm not really there
there is no socialism part but i'm just there's a sleep yeah like it oh i i i don't know what part
there that there is i could ever be acceptable because every single part of nazism is also
just strewn through it is hinged on antisemitism uh among many other things so like oh sure he might
let i it like maybe we have that that one guy who's like you know hitler was wrong on these
things but he had some pretty good ideas here it's like no um all of his i all of his ideas were
hinged on some hinged on awful things if you accept any of them you're except you're accepting
some awful stuff and baggage with them there's there is no acceptable hitler but what about
if someone was just a fan of the nazis because they loved hitler's paintings they were just like
he's just a great artist i think that they should go to an art museum and look at
yeah good point that was that was just a bad joke that was a bad joke yeah yeah we got some
we got some amazing super chats um guys like i just saw like two two trips and three thank you
i think just from a practical standpoint like everything i don't see a really good practical
reason to not de-platform i can see why people would be hesitant to de-platform but i also think
that every last single thing they want to do reach out to people de-radicalize people may or
deconstruct right-wing beliefs can be done without platforming these people and in addition
if you want to have conversations i think that's it's fine to want to have these conversations
with people and to try and help them through things i would not be uh uh where i am
if it had not been for my friends personally talking to me about my beliefs and helping to
de-radicalize me note that did not happen online but yeah de-radicalization doesn't happen online
it happens back here so you can have these conversations but have them over your dms
yeah i think it's also better if we're also accounting for people's humanity and stuff like
that i think it's also even better for those people on the right later when they finally become
de-radicalized come over to our side i think it's far better that they did that without the public
eye watching them than having to go through that trauma and then like what's happening and then
also on top of that everyone fucks up in the past everyone has we recently and we have seen
more than once how easy it is for people who get really get angry to find your fuckups in the past
and dredge them up for no other purpose than just to be malicious this just recently happened with
Lindsay Ellis and it was awful yeah i remember yeah is she's is she back yet because like
she's on she did some videos on nebula recently okay cool but i think that in the long run it's
also just better that everyone do this not in the public sphere we de-platform them stop them from
being able to spread out to be able to build up an infrastructure and a recruiting base and that
stops them from spreading effectively and then we can individually reach out to those people and
also we can reach larger amounts of people with things like video essays deconstructing those
beliefs without having to platform them when they don't have a way to try and rhetoric their way out
of those out of our revivals when they don't have a way to get a sit a word in that undermines us
it's much more effective that's why contra points has been very effective yeah contra points like
that essay on jk ruling was amazing let me just read these super chats right wing politics and
religions have a fundamental assumption they share that there's a natural order the sub that
subjects gets one group of people and privileges another they're discreet on superficial stuff
rather than politics and religion have a fundamental yeah what do you think about that
thank you for the super chat jake i really appreciate it
uh i don't think that actually applies to definitely does not apply to all religions at all
um not even remotely hey my it applies to specific mainline sects of christianity
for sure and it applies to some you know different theologies and islam and and a few other religions
but um for example in the abrahamic faiths this definitely feels in my in my faith we don't really
believe that any particular group is being being privileged over another group yeah but my
we as norse pagans were in my groups we are completely open to everyone no matter what we
do not believe that gods are limited on your we're not focused focus believes that your religion is
tied to your genetic heritage and that's disgusting and gross uh we are not we do this about all that
we believe it's open to everyone regardless of their race gender sexual orientation being a whole
nine yards and we also don't believe that people who do not believe in our faith are uh somehow
underprivileged by not being part of our religion they're not going to some mystic hell or anything
like that and they are not obliged to follow the precepts of this faith and i think that uh
and i think that there's a you know i i think there's a lot of religions like that um a lot of
religions are more universal like that as much as people don't think that they are and so yeah
and i'll even a lot of modern christian movements are moving away from that kind of thinking
i yeah i would probably more agree with jacob in that i i would say that there is a fundamental
assumption um there but um that's that that fundamental assumption is like maybe not in
your religion i don't know enough about it which we should do another opposite of that that'd be
totally interesting um and i've been trying to get your ocean to kelto i've been trying to i've
i've been emailing him back and forth like for a while trying to get him on go i know you guys
buddies um but ocean's a good friend yeah he's he's and he's a cool guy um but um
we can talk about this for ages but essentially like you've got the like you know just historically
you got abrahamic you know the the historical um you got like the hebrus which were the historical
in group of god's favorite people and then you've got jesus and he's like saying separate yourself
from the world um and the world is you know friendship the world is enemies to god and then
you've got islam who literally believe that um you know that um that's you know in historically
that their book you know that they are the true religion and that everyone else like you can just
see when you go on tiktok there's so many apologists saying jesus was a muslim and you need to you
know convert to islam it's the one true religion there's very much an us versus them a fundamental
assumption that there's like a natural order of um that one group is privileged in the other group
isn't but maybe i'm reading to that wrong but um let me move on to the robot hate just super chat
the most and 20 thank you so much the most glaringly similar the most glaring similarities
between islamic fundamentalism christian dominion and white ethon nationalism are patriarchy and
authoritarianism are they not maybe we have deeper problems than religion itself yeah it's like
yeah you were saying you were saying christie like um i don't think i'm not sure i don't think
either patriarchy or authoritarianism originated in any of those faiths they originate out they
just became they just ended up infiltrating them and becoming very partially inseparable to a lot
of those of sex of them um well this is this is where i you see this is why i'll have i'll have
inspiring philosophy you know michael he's a good friend of mine um on to talk about his christian
beliefs i'll joke around with him but i i think some of his beliefs aren't like i'm not good i
don't think they're good but i try and i'm trying to have a public discussion so that hopefully
some of his audience comes over and they see um see me like kind of push back on some of his ideas
i even had one of his um one of his not one of his fans call me like message me on on on facebook
going and spending two hours with him on the on the phone talking to him about beliefs um because
he was you know he wanted to challenge me on stuff so i was like yeah let's do this but
i think it also benefit of it does also depend on the beliefs i don't think all hate i don't
feel all hateful the beliefs are necessarily made equally uh egregious in that they aren't all
equally likely to be harmful uh directly or to reach people as well um so for example um
um most christ most people today most christians today are starting to actually move away from
beliefs and like hell and stuff like that especially like the hellfire and brimstone
thing it's a really hateful belief it's a really you know not fun one to deal with i don't think
it's necessarily out of the question to have debates on hell uh very specifically because
no one i don't i i don't really know anyone who converts to christianity without being directly
raised in it and bombarded it with it from the start who convert because hell
hmm yeah i guess so but it's not exactly an enticing belief to come over to from
i'm you see this is the thing this is the thing i keep you in not what brings you in
the there's um sorry go super chat from river city films no 51 dollars thank you no question but
just want to beat d thank you so much i appreciate the super chat that's uh i'm saving up for a
camera um so thank you so much i appreciate that that makes a world of a difference thank you river
city um and thank you d and everyone else who's super channeled that's incredible um the thing
with me is i i don't actually care about someone converting to christianity i i wouldn't care if
someone converted christianity as long as the reasons they i don't like the beliefs of christian
i hate the religion love the religious hate the religion you know like you know love the sin i hate
the sin with the um but um but it's like but the i i want them to i want everyone to i'm hoping
that everyone makes decisions based on rationality and logic and not based on um personal experiences
that are like very subjective in nature or um or or things like that especially when
i always hope that they that they have a level of that subjectivity very specifically because
i can logic my way into awful things it is not hard to logic your way into awful beliefs and
that's what makes them really dangerous is because it's not hard to do that
um it's much harder to logic your way out of them sometimes
you yeah i don't really i don't how so like how how would you logic your way into being a nazi
okay so the precepts of of being like a i'll be broader fascist i'll clip this i'll clip
okay so their fascism usually arises in the midst of like of there being um sociological
turmoil especially economic economic turmoil has arisen what is the cause of the economic turmoil
there are multiple ways of going about interpreting that
okay so for example you can identify the fact that you can identify perhaps um
in the case of marxist we i did marxist identify one of the major economic
problems of economic disparity being that the fact that wealth is located in the
among the top one percent and is not being redistributed and workers are not being paid
for their labor but are being exploited for it causing mass wealth inequality causing class
divisions where all the power is being associated with the class with the most wealth and blah blah
blah okay i can logic my way into that here's another way of logic into it okay well i don't
know how well i don't know how to get to uh oh what how does that get you to being a nazi though
no well i that's one way of going oh yeah yeah the economic problem here's another way
so we're in the we're in germany um economic the economic situation in germany has completely
collapsed um people are poor it takes thousands of marx to bri a loaf of bread
where are now here's where people get really uh frustrated okay we're we're trying to figure out
what is the problem here marxists are saying the wealth is because wealth's not being equally
redistributed uh that there's huge class uh disparities that we're being exploited they
take that they are being exploited they realize that they're being exploited intuitively that's
just true who's exploiting them well where who are who are people who that are popularly being
associated with wealth wealth distribution and holding it
juice
hmm it's not hard to logic your way into what the solution is from there well i no i don't i
disagree and i mean no if it's been popularly believed that they are if it's if it's popularly
believed that one group is the one that's holding all of the wealth and is causing the economic
downturn that's leading to mass poverty starvation and other things
they're and that they're the solution to that is to forcibly take from them to target that group
yeah that that could be that could be um but that that that could have little to do with
you could so there's okay i'm starving all right i'm starving and i need food the logic
to that is if i can't get food anywhere else i might have to steal it from my family
right that's that's that's that that is the prescription that prescription
is people are for people aren't wanting a fix just for today they're wanting a fix forever
right but but saying the jews read today the that that prescription there is wrong that
prescription isn't accurate just because let's say let's say in germany and i don't know enough
about world war two history but let's say in germany every rich person was jewish for some reason
it still would not it would still not be a it would be a leap in logic it would be the non
non sequitur hour for you to go because they have all the money therefore they must be the ones
oppressing us like it that's and therefore we should take we should exterminate them as people
that is like a huge leap in logic that's that's not logic that's just like that's like emotional
i'm angry at the jew i need to go and this is this money this video is getting monetized
demonetized for sure but that's like you know um i'm angry at the jew and i'm i need to take
revenge on them that's the that that's not logic that's the opposite that's that's anger towards
a group of people for non-logic reasons non-logical reasons that's like anger can be logical
oh you see this is i think this is where we just have our fundamental disagreement there
there is no contradiction in their logic it all it does follow that's the the problem
when you want to say something's illogical you got to figure out where the actual where it's
actually invalid like where in their logic is it actually invalid i can point out where that's
invalid like yours that i can point out where your logic was invalid there where where did i
where did i make it where did i make it make it in a uh invalid argument you have to demonstrate
that the premises do not follow or that the conclusion does not follow from the premises
that there is someone for a form formally formal reason so yeah so either i'm like just denying
my antecedent or i am uh affirming my consequence something like that yeah so the it would be and
i could be wrong but you you stated a bunch of prescription descriptions of reality and then
your leap from that description to the prescription that there's no there's no like that that logic
it doesn't work well here let's do a syllogism yeah if society let's write it down i'll write
the premise one p1 p1 if uh there is economic uh disparity in society that disparity has a cause
if there is economic disparity
that disparity has a cause yeah okay if there if that disparity has a cause
we can locate that cause
as a cause we we can locate that cause yeah okay
so if there's economic disparity we can locate the cause
that is our well i don't know if i don't know if i that is our first i'm gonna i'm gonna hypothetically
grant p2 because i don't know if you can in world war two but let's say you could
hypothetically well you can't say you can't say there's disparity if you don't know what's
if you can't say that there's a cause to the disparity how can you say there's disparity
well i well i think what the what the nazis did is they said that the jews were the um cause
which are the jews were the cause no and we can disagree on we will disagree on how they
on that ultimate conclusion but what ultimately is the case is that it's still they can still
formally logic their way there now we can go through and say that well we don't think that
x premise is sound there's a difference between being logically sound and logically valid
but what's the conclusion like how do you go from p1 p2 let's say we grant those two things
well okay the conclusion was then if uh if there's economic disparity we can locate the
cause that is our first that is going to be our first syllogism it's a more going to be a multi
syllogism argument yeah so p1 is there uh if there's economic disparity that disparity can um uh
disparity has a cause that's not that wrong yeah p2 if that disparity has a cause we can locate
that cause is there another p or is there just a conclusion no here's and then here's a conclusion
and then the conclusion is therefore if there's economic disparity we can locate the cause this
is a hypothetical syllogism is what it's called but what about the yeah so where's the prescription
there we're we're going to get there we have to there's another another syllogism that comes
into play off of this oh okay okay so p1 is we read p2 we've read so p2 is kind of the conclusion
why um so okay so now p2 is not the conclusion p2 is the second part so the way hypothetical
syllogism works is that you are linking two premises together by their shared statement
so we can locate that cause as the shared statement that combines these two together into one that the
combined is the is the conclusion okay so
essentially then what ends up what's going to end up falling is if we can locate that cause
uh we must locate that cause
some okay for the betterment of society okay so will this be p3 or p2a
uh is well we can make this uh it would actually need to be like p4
because we're missing you didn't put in p3 here uh p3 what's p3 p3 is
if there is economic economic disparity then that disparity then we we can locate
the cause
combination of the of the two that's where the that's where that all falls then p4
okay awesome if we can locate that cause
it better if you run then we are obligated to locate that cause okay okay so now we have established
we are obligated to locate the cause here's where we're going to start doing that
i don't know if i don't know if we're obligated but yeah like i'm grown able to grant this but
it's a lot it it does it is so far validly following okay all right and if we can locate
that cause we are obligated to locate that cause if we are obligated to locate that cause then
okay
uh how do i watch this
so then p5 if we are obligated to locate that cause then we must also be obligated to overturn
that cause to fix society okay i disagree with that but i want to see where you're going well
it's the we will disagree with that that's where we're going to end up arguing that it's not sound
this is going to end up following complete in terms of formal logic this is going to actually
end up being completely valid okay we'll continue then to the conclusion so
then p6 we construct our next one therefore if we can locate that cause
then we must also be obligated to overturn that cause to fix society
so then here is where we're going to then construct everything into another
oscillatism that cause so
i'm not going to write this one in jet essentially it's going to take the form of modus ponens which
is a completely logical syllogism and it's essentially going to say that um the cause of it
of economic disparity is wealth being held by by the jews that therefore we must
take action against the jews premise conclusion and all that well and then all those are going
to be justified points because we've now located we've established logically
i don't want to write it because i don't need that taken out of context
about the the the clips that'll come from this where we had someone yeah i'm i'm not i'm not
going to have fun i said but essentially it's going to take the form of a modus ponens you know
if we if the uh if the jews are the cause of the economic disparity then we must take action
and to overturn that to against them to for to overturn that disparity even if i even if i
granted all your um all the premises there which i i would argue on most of them no yeah you would
we we can argue on all of you would both argue we can argue on the soundness on every single one
i agree but the point is that every single one of these logically follows in the sense that they
are all valid formally if i were to put this all into symbolic logic yeah like a mathematical
like a mathematical equation there is no formal fallacy that the the there would be a formal
fallacy on rounding them all up taking them to the Auschwitz and gassing them they they they
well there wouldn't be on taking their money there's a difference but like let's say we
let's say i'm not sure here well we can do the the specifics of the solution are not specifically
in here yeah but like let's say but the solution to all the premises would be to redistribute
wealth amongst everyone not to like kill them sometimes but what they would end up arguing
is that in order to do that sometimes the most effective way to take that wealth is to kill people
in which case it would mean communists definitely definitely agreed with that sentiment when they
when the soviets took over i mean i just historically just about every single revolution
ever has agreed with that sentiment i i just see the like i don't think that you that
that even formally they may agree with that sentiment but that's that's irrational
it was an irrational conclusion based on starvation i mean in world war two people
it well it's not it's not a rational it's formal it is formal it's formally valid
i don't think it is there is no there is no formal there is no formal fallacy being
committed here i did not come in denying and seeing it did not uh affirm the consequent
anywhere etc etc etc what about but how do you go from okay okay so i i agree that if you grant all
this just uh they don't need to justify the specific violence they take they just need to justify
a general violence the specifics will never violence in the acts and the forms it takes
is never completely rational in any way violence is all like specifics of violence and what violence
is taken is never rational no matter whose side it's on and no matter what logic goes into it
that does not therefore that mean though that there was not a logic that justified it in their mind
yeah i i agree but what i would point out to the nazi that is trying to tell me that it's logical
is that they're not being logical i'm pointing out that they're that that jump from it's a
non-secular jump from even if it was true that the jews had all the wealth and the jews were the
problem that we can then kill them that would be a jump in logic that is not valid
it would be if you're in a situation where you think that that's the only or the most effective
solution to redistributing wealth which is the ultimate problem
i don't know if it like i you don't know if it is but that's the but that's the thing is that you
can't make a logical argument based on what you don't know well i'm being i'm being i'm being
i'm trying to be um cordial i don't think it is like i i i agree i like i sure i am very anti i am
completely anti-nazi i want to make that clear yeah yeah coming in ourselves in a tricky situation
trans woman don't kill me um
but the point the point is that uh well very specifically uh do you think that there would
how do you think that a rat there would be a rational way to go from okay we've justified
taking we've justified wealth redistribution
and we've justified we've logically argued that we have a justification to take that wealth
and we are obligated to do that for the betterment of society
do you think that there's going to be any nonviolent way that happens at some point someone's
defending their wealth what what or at some point so i think this like i think this comes down i
think this this comes to the foundational area where i think we have a bit of an impasse because
i don't believe that that you can logic your way to something like that unless you're um i believe
it was sorry not you probably can but i believe what it was is i don't believe the nazis were
doing that i think they were acting in um they were acting in desperation they were
believing propaganda and misinformation i don't think they had a logical thought process behind
um it was out of desperation the same way it's like you know a heroin addict
that's the thing about propaganda and that's why propaganda is effective
propaganda has the veneer of logical cohesion it makes sense intuitively to people
that's why it's effective logic is a very easily abused tool
no one you can come to just about any conclusion that you want to with a with logical premises
if i exist the moon is made of green cheese i exist therefore the moon is made of green cheese
that is a completely logical formally valid modus ponens or modus pol yeah modus ponens
even even is it's not sound okay but we but that's the thing is that
no one will i'm not saying that the argument will sound i'm saying that you could and
well that's part of what i meant when i say logic okay it needs to be like you can argue
with a nazi and show that their reasoning isn't sound yes and that's what i think should be done
um yeah the problem is is that the problem is is where you're going to end up where where
in situations where you can't do that because not all because it's not always obvious where
they aren't sound that's why debates are really just really bad things debates are you can twist
logic to do whatever you want i can make lot twist logic to make it seem like the moon is
made of green cheese but if you can't spot where the soundness is a problem in the in the moment
of that debate you are screwed and that's why propaganda is effective because it can yeah
reach out to people before and they don't know where it's not sound but what they do know is that
it logically follows because it's valid they can look at the valid structure and see that
yeah these points follow they follow from each other i i um yeah i i guess and so oh jeez in my
in my view because the way that the way that nazis structure themselves even if you can prove
them wrong on one point they have a million others that you can't always address the way they
structure themselves is that no matter what the situation is they win that's why rhetorical debates
with them is a waste of time he said well i mean they don't lose them because i don't think i don't
think that like like so um yeah i i i don't well i haven't watched many debates with nazis to be
honest um everyone i've seen i've i've um watched them like fumble over themselves and and yeah
but you're not looking at people that are trained debaters it uh sometimes i am like nick fuentes he
like that's his whole job yeah and i've also seen nick fuentes unfortunately be pretty effective
that's why yeah i think yeah um yeah that's i i i it always it always depends and it depends on
it always depends on the interlocutors and when it's a situation where it is at best a coin toss
whether or not you're going to look good up against a nazi in a debate
hmm i think yeah no i don't like that's throw away like us like like i said i would not uh yeah i mean
i mean um yeah who's like why why are we giving them the chance to look good when we could just
create a video essay and they have no say because i'll tell you why i'll tell you exactly why because
his followers the all people who are just starting to follow him aren't going to watch
a video essay critical on him however they would watch him come and destroy some um bluehead
lefty right so like you want them to you want to get some of their audience as long as you're like
i'm kind of of the position that is this goes back to the beginning of this conversation though
people with people on the right would deeply help beliefs don't change their beliefs over online debates
i i i you can you can cite the five people that sent you an email
but that's an anecdotal fallacy okay well let me let me just let me just let me just kind of
conclude with some of the stuff i some of the pros and cons that i thought of and then i guess you
can give me some have you got a couple of minutes to chat yeah awesome um so these are the pros and
cons that i have and just and just hear me out that these are some of the things so removing
someone from a social group or ostracizing them from online um uh engagement right so like removing
them from coming on a talk show or something like that or not being on a panel with them
the pros of that is it deterrence is a deterrence so it's you the social ostracization of that person
they can then it might deter them from speaking out against against group norms right um number
two there's pressure to change that person has pressure to reevaluate their beliefs and decide
whether or not it's something they want to um to kind of look for hill they want to die die on
number three it protects vulnerable communities which i think is super important it's something
that i try and do on deep drinks even on the deep drinks server one of my mods is a christian
we're not an atheist server we have muslims hindu christians um atheists and all sorts on
there and we have this button that people can either click it to um say i'm not open to change
my mind in in that case no one's to challenge them on their beliefs but they're also not allowed to
challenge other people open to challenge my beliefs so for sufficient reasons so you know engage them
a little bit and i'm wanting people to challenge me so i'm giving people the option to even
be okay with engaging with their beliefs with their religious beliefs so i think that's important
even for people who aren't uh necessarily vulnerable but they might be muslim or christian and they
feel vulnerable i want to give them that um ability and then maintaining group values i think it's
another benefit of it is like safe deep drinks i started having like all kind of
nut jobs on here all the time it would kind of degrade the group values that we're kind of building
here which is an opening and inclusive place for people um where we discuss deep subjects
however the cons and these are some cons that i think um uh that i that i wrote down so alienation
so ostracization ostracized individuals who associate with harmful ideologies might push them
further into the fringes potential leading to a deeper entrenchment in their beliefs uh to a loss
of dialogue opportunities so we lose the ability to they lose the ability to be confronted we can't
confront them anymore because they're no longer part of our community uh three inability to monitor
them so this is a point that d brought up before is we don't know when there's going to be a terrorist
attack or when there's going to be um a riots in the street or when something's going to happen
because we can't monitor these people in these like with these fringe um crazy ideas and for
the perpetuation of echo chambers so these echo chambers build and they grow in their fester and
you end up getting things like um the january 6 riots or um the you you know you gandhan bill
the lgbt anti-lgbt bill over in america so um i think that there are pros and cons and for me
it's a it's a juggling act between wanting to make sure i can have conversations that are
challenging to the audience as well i don't want to just have this isn't just like the atheist happy
hour where we all circle jack about how dumb religion is i try to bring christians on to
have conversations about that i try to bring um people in with different perspectives to me but
it's a juggling act because i'm also trying to um create a safe environment for people who are part
of vulnerable communities um so they're the like the pros and cons that i um wrote down but i just
want to quickly touch on and then i'll get your thoughts so the first two in the removing from
social group of the pros were deterrence social ostracization and the pressure to change now this
is the part where i think we disagree i would a big part where we disagree i i would argue that that
even those two things that are pros the deterrence and the pressure to change are not necessarily
good things i don't think people should change because they feel pressure from the group i think
they should um change because they have come to the conclusion that their belief wasn't rationally
or logically justified i think that we should have um the ability that people in the group should
have the ability to pressure them to logically consider and rationally consider their um perspectives
but i would i i don't believe that people should stop believing something because the group doesn't
like what they have to say or they should they the group is pressuring them to change i think
that they should be pushed to logically and rationally examine that now but i'm of the opinion
that um i'm of the opinion that you you can't essentially logic and rational your way to
well i guess you can but i guess the be essential enough pushback to not not have like another
world war two or another um you know or the situation in ukraine the people supporting
Putin in my opinion aren't doing it for rational reasons they're doing it for a very irrational
reasons um so yeah that's why that's that's that's kind of some pros and cons i'd like to get your
thoughts on that so with those pros like your issues with them ultimately where i am at specifically
as a trans person in america is i don't care why people change their views i care specifically
about the harm they're doing because there's something i think that there are infinitely more
important moral things to consider in this situation than did you change your opinion
for the right reason i'd rather you just like i don't care why you changed your opinion as long
if you change your opinion and you're now functioning on the side of the allies cool
you can ration you can rationalize your way how like how you justify that later
but we need ally but but effectively in reality
why you why you chose to change your views matters far less than whether or not you're an
activist for good yeah um so i i i don't think that that's a particularly
no i don't i don't think it's a particularly um
problematic point there myself specifically in these since situations maybe if we're like in the
purely the purely academic world where it's just all all theory sure you're right but in in the world
where you know i cannot use a bathroom in florida without going to prison that's ridiculous well
actually that's a very good can i can i i know that i told you you would speak but i just need
to interrupt because i think you were so right and that this puts me in the position where i'm in a
position of um i'm in the position of um privilege here where like imagine me going to let's let's
use the nazi germany example again just to get cancelled a fifth time but let's imagine if i was
to go over to nazi germany and be like okay i'm going to interview a nazi and just see what you
know and just push back on some of the beliefs like no no no no they're fucking killing jews like
they're killing jews they're killing gypsies they're killing people um gays and lesbians like this is
not a conversation that we can have at the moment so in that aspect in the aspect of like
trans bathrooms and trans identity i think yeah you're there's there's it's almost a disgusting
it's almost a disgusting idea that to for me it's fun chess game to argue against someone and stand
and be an ally but at the end of the day i'm not affected by these laws and you are so i can totally
i can totally empathize with uh with that perspective a hundred percent and that's and
that's part of why i wanted to have you only have this conversation because i'm very torn
i think this is also then where we get um with the cons specifically you mentioned potentially
losing access maybe they festering their movement you know boils up over into um you know a january
sixth situation that is a very real possibility i acknowledge that on my counter is that on the
pro side if we deplatform and continue deplatforming we pursue them track them that doesn't happen
because then they can't organize when you when you strip them of their ability to organize
those events don't happen so you just continue stripping them you don't stop with youtube you
take away their twitter you take away their facebook you take away everything until they are
in the dark ages try mobilizing an effective fascist movement when no when no one will do
business with you it won't happen this yeah there's a um january sixth happened because they had
access to all sorts of things to mobilize around all sorts of different communication passages
but when i i do not advocate just you know oh you don't come on the youtube channel anymore
i i find that ineffective take away all of it so okay yeah that's that's that's quite interesting
what about okay so that's like an extreme they're we're talking we're very much talking extremes
right um but what about someone who just has like i know they're like they're the equivalent of
like someone who smokes weed but you know in the drug world you know it's like is it a drug
you know it's like it's like um it's like what do you think about someone who just has some
ideas that align necessarily align with the conservative party maybe and you know like
how many steps removed can we go like someone who's maybe a conservative but they are an lgbt
ally they consider themselves an lgbt ally they um yeah i i i do think that there are degrees and
i also think that there are degrees to which people are are or are not harmful um there are people like
uh he was a youtuber he was a he was in the nationalist camp's name was the golden one and i
everyone just universally thought of him as like a meme um uh he was a joke there was a there were
a joke he was also one of those bodybuilder types there were jokes about like keeping him as a pet
and things like that um yeah some people in the chat know who i'm talking about yeah he was um
he was uh back in the day he was a a favorite of contra points there were all they had a
weirdly respectful back and forth um on occasion it was really funny um there are people like that
they're just
they're ridiculous and there is an extent to which i think that
ridiculous individuals like that who affect cannot effectively promote their views and just
look awful um aren't worth the time to go about deplatforming them like that it's just not worth
the effort because they're just yeah there's also some where i don't think that they are
necessarily trying that they're not trying to be malicious or they're not that egregious
in compare like not so egregious i would ever i would say that ebd platformed or any or something
like that i do have some conservative friends um how do i do have people that i interact with
who are conservatives um james valiant uh is one of those people he's you know advocates for
own provenance and stuff in uh online but ultimately uh i i i don't think that their
views should go unchallenged for sure and i but i do think that people like that are safer to have
these debates with and have these conversations with publicly where at because they're people
that are going to be more amenable to actually listening to us and actually having an authentic
conversation with us nazis are not out to do that people on that site are not out to have an
authentic honest conversation with you matt wash is not out to do that we shouldn't be trying
no because we're just giving them i would although the same with like kent hoven but if
i was taking opportunity to debate kent hoven any day of the week just so i could troll him
until he rage quit like i would just love it so much it'd be so it'd be so enjoyable um i would
just say stuff like man your your body's slamming me in this debate and you know like you i don't
know anyway that's beyond the that's that's the that's a fantasy of mine but i uh we have a question
from d uh um sorry with the guests um with the guest subjects are being banned by right wingers
and falling into obscurity as she wishes others um yeah i don't really care what the right wing uh
has to say or if they ban me if they decide to ban me cool i don't want to be around them anyways um
no but like safe like safe you had some ideas like um like i noticed that you um well i mean
they would already want to deplat for me because how dare i support trans youth yeah i mean like
that's a that's an automatic one that would get me banned because how dare i you know i
advocate human rights um but well ban me ban me for being a decent person
yeah so i i'm i'm hurt like this is the other thing is i need i i legitimately just
don't care about hurting right wingers feelings so i i um i'm at that point in in my life and also
if i go into obscurity cool um yeah i in case anyone hasn't noticed i don't have a youtube channel
and i don't um go and i don't go out of my way really for the most part to become
some massive influencer either so if i go into obscurity that's whatever um yeah i well something
something this is actually a really good example right so um and and um please don't uh can i
well first of all i'll ask can i offer some um some subjective criticism of yourself
yeah sure so and i don't know enough about this so i'm kind of only speaking i'm speaking on behalf
of someone so um i have a friend uh uh anastasia her father was killed by russian missile while
standing on the balcony of his harkiv home in ukraine she she is very left um but she uh
grew up in ukraine and she has issues against huge issues with um the with uh people who use
the hammer and sickle so i noticed that like on your twitter you have the hammer and sickle
logo there next to blm and next and when i was talking to her on the phone the other day
i know that you have an interpretation of i'm sure you have an interpretation of the
hammer sickle that's nothing to do with what i'm about to say but she was mentioning to me that
for ukranians that is almost as bad or as bad as the nazi symbol for them it it um it yeah especially
the holodomor and type it in ten sites yeah so let's say that for some reason um the um and
once again i know that you don't have that for these reasons but let's say for some reason
hopefully anyway ukraine wins they kick russia's ass out of there and they and the world becomes
very pro ukraine this narrative starts to build someone goes back on your twitter they see you
have this and they go you were a um uh hammer and sickle person a nazi or something you need to
be banned and then they they ostracize you from the internet like would you feel like okay like
do you think that should be the standard that is i do think that's a fair reaction
okay um i
now i am not a supporter of russia as you also see on my twitter there's a ukraine
yeah let me just sign the ukranian flag right next to me yeah um we're saying how people can
i think that no i i have actually received that criticism for using the hammer and sickle before
and i think it is a valid criticism of using that symbol i think as a that is completely valid
and i would have i'd be completely understanding if ukrainian platforms did not want me on them
okay as a result and honestly i would be if people really wanted me to do that i would be
more than willing to remove that okay as well i understand i i do understand those criticisms
and i take it seriously that that is something they weren't criticizing you by the way they
were just mentioning that in in policy yeah no i but i i bring it up um i i think that is valid
and i think it's something that we need to be conscious of uh as leftist we need to be conscious
of the symbols we use we need to be conscious of the uh things the flags that we fly
including the associations that those have um i've actually been rethinking my use of that
symbol for a while now um very specifically not necessarily uh because of ukraine because that
symbol's been mostly abandoned uh in russia and other other domineering places but actually
specifically to do with china and its oppression of the Uyghurs yeah this is the thing i think we
both have very similar goals in regards to our um um perspectives i mean regardless we have very
similar goals but i think just now i think there is also an extent to which we have which
there are it is also commendable to try and also reclaim symbols as well
some symbols are beyond reclamation there's yeah no world in which there despite being
norse pagan there are reasons i do not publicly wear very many symbols of my faith and as because
they have been so in so taken over by white supremacists and nazis that it is an automatic
identifier to people who don't know who i am that i might be one um like for example thors hammer
milnear um is a symbol all throughout white supremacist circles it was on we you know the
q anon shaman guy who was at january six he had a tattooed on his chest and it is recognizable
to everyone uh yeah that that dude put like that dude is such a meme um but yeah but it's a you
know it's an instantly identifiable symbol that says to people potentially says to people
white supremacist there are times there are still there are people working on reclaiming
that symbol people in my movement are actively are working to reclaim that and to give it a new
image that is you know associated with progressive movements um and i think that
similar rehabilitation is potentially do the hammer and sickle as well especially considering that
it's not simply a symbol of russia it it has a long history long before russia
and long before the soviet union it was the it was the symbol of the international worker
it was the symbol of used of the labor parties uh the socialist labor parties here in the united
states like the communist party of the united states it was also used in the uk it was used
everywhere that symbol has a very long and very intimate history with workers rights
yeah same with um same with the the uh nazi symbol right like when i went to japan i was like
there's a lot of these symbols right yeah swastika has a very rich history in other places
and you know in other religions and in other places it's used in hinduism it's used in japan
it's used all over um i think that we need to be conscious about potentially trying to reclaim
some of these symbols some of them i believe though are beyond reclamation and i think that we it is
potentially a conversation that needs to be had like on the hammer and sickles is it beyond reclamation
i i've um so my beautiful wife has just brought in our little baby which means that um i went way
over time um but i i want to i got a couple of questions if we could just wrap up um christy i
and this has been this although you know we had some um heated moments i enjoyed this conversation
i thank you thank you for coming on um so first of all we asked the question at the start where
everyone sat from zero to ten um on whether or not we should do platforms so zero being um
no um what was zero oh my gosh don't do platform and ten is we do platform yeah ten is we did
ten is i'm in favor of just wiping everyone yeah so what is um so has anyone moved on that scale
at all or let's like because i'm i'm the kind of person needs to go and think about things for a
few weeks to kind of like massage them in my brain a little bit but um but i christy's definitely
given me some things to think about especially when it comes to your perspective on you know i
don't care why people believe something i just want shit to change i can see the same arguments
being made for veganism like a lot of a lot of vegans are just like look animals are fucking
dying this bullshit i don't care like we just need to stop it now it's about um yeah the number my
number one goal is the betterment of society and if you're going to help do that i don't care how
you get there so has anyone has anyone changed on that or again they can see themselves changing
and if so comment down below i'm gonna as we do that i'm gonna ask you a question and i'm gonna
get my little son and and i'm a little little boy um and show um the the world the debut of um
of atlas his name is but um uh so the first question i want to ask you christy and this
is this would be good for a for a polytheistic north pagan is what is the most plausibly true
religion that you don't believe in i don't believe in um that's difficult because i'm a hard polytheist
so yeah i'm pretty much willing to grant that everyone's gods exist right so like when you say
exist you mean like exist like how jordan peterson thinks that god exists or do you think
like where he's like it's actually his consciousness of the like i i think are okay yeah
peterson is a is a youngian archetypalist and i think youngian archetypes are pseudoscience
and i have virulent hatred of that kind of thing i have the red book up here and let me tell you
that's very hard polytheist believe that they are actually gods
uh okay i like very cute baby hello you just woke up i'm just just trying to keep you
entertained but till he starts screaming um also yeah no i believe that they are actual entities
that exist well let me let me rephrase it then if um what is the most plausibly true religion
so if you believe that they're all true if you weren't worship worshiping the north gods
and you have to choose a god that wasn't um in the same like gang i'll say um what uh what what
what religion would you choose victoria with a few but honestly the
the one that that outside of this that's honestly always spoken the most to me still is
still christianity outside of this okay interesting very specifically from the free
methodist branch but i would probably i wouldn't be able to really find a community there because
it's not to my knowledge really a progressive element from the free methodist church that's easy
to find um my family my my family's been in the free methodist tradition since 1890s so
yeah i had so many notes to go like to talk to you about um uh about like your your grandfather
and anita brian and like and oh we could there's some really cool stuff we could talk about another
time oh yeah um so and uh regarding your belief system so you said you were at like a um an eight
what will what would it take to get you down to a five
i would need like some serious heart data driven proof that the that public debating of this kind
is actually effective i've not found any data to support this i found a lot of data against it
for the most part yeah and i would ask you have you looked at the studies but i know that you've
looked at the studies like i have but if there's anyone who's looking at studies it's probably you
well christie thank you so much for coming on let's just see is anyone changed their position
um it doesn't look like anyone's commented um but
