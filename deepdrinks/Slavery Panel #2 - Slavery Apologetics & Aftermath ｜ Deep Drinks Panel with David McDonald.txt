All support is super appreciated.
Apologetics is quite literally a defense of a faith.
The Greek word apologia means defense
as a lawyer gives that trial.
This is important to remember by definition,
an apologist does not have the goal of uncovering the truth.
I will say that again,
an apologist does not have the goal
by definition of uncovering the truth.
The apologist's goal is to defend
what they have already decided to be true.
To continue the analogy,
a lawyer will often successfully defend their client
by winning over the jury or the judge
with trickery, semantic games, emotional appeals,
or fallacies.
Often we see the same characteristics in apologists.
I welcome everyone today to sit in the seat of the jury
to ask tough questions,
to pull apart everything our panel says,
to examine the nuts and bolts,
and to question everything.
Today we look at the aftermath of the previous panel,
respond to some slavery comments and apologetics
and take questions from the audience.
If you have something you really wanna have answered,
super chat it and we'll mark it as a top priority
to make sure I ask everyone.
Welcome everyone, this will be amazing.
Welcome everyone to the deep drink slavery panel
number two how's everyone doing good well thank you how are you doing all right
very good very good in this every month now so yeah it's it's always fun it's
always fun to hang out with you guys I'd begin to do it every month but it'd be
good to change topics I think because slavery is a little little dark if we
could go through everyone could everyone just introduce themselves and just
mention briefly what they've got going on what are they currently working on as
well as what you're drinking all right so right yeah I think we've got to kill
hi everyone I'm I'm Kip Davis I am a scholar in Second Temple Judaism
specializing in the Dead Sea Scrolls with the particular focus on scribal
practices as well as the transmission of literature many other things I also
run a YouTube channel just under my name Kip Davis I currently have a series
ongoing called the Dead Sea Scrolls unapologetically where I'm taking a deep
dive into the Dead Sea Scrolls their contents and the history of their
discovery I just dropped number three this last week I think it's pretty great
and you should watch it yeah I have to just butt in there and say the guys this
isn't one that you put on a second monitor and just walk away and like
listen to it this is like grab your favorite drink wine a coffee a beer sit
back and like this is this is really entertaining this is like entertaining
scholarship so thanks man and these so these map animations that you're showing
right now I'm very proud of this I didn't do this yeah you kidding I I got in
touch with with a great guy from Australia by the name of Lachlan Davis he
runs a channel called Bible Unboxed he's a PhD student in his final year and he
also does video editing and animations and so he made that amazing map for me
but people should really check his stuff out because it's really good cool yeah oh
and oh what are you drinking I got the memo so apparently we're all drinking the
king of beers today which is something I actually haven't drunk since I was in my
early 20s so so we'll see how this goes

a well I'm unemployed really but I tell people I'm a public-facing scholar of
the Bible and religion and I seek to combat the spread of misinformation
about the Bible and religion I enjoyed the conversation last time very much and
I am working on a handful of things I'm on tiktok I'm on Instagram I'm on YouTube
I'm on Twitter and I am at this moment uploading the very first episode of the
data over dogma podcast on our new YouTube channel youtube.com forward slash
at data over dogma we're looking at uploading 75% we've got a couple of
minutes left and and I'll make sure that goes live while we're in our discussion
I'm very much looking forward to having that podcast go live and as like some of
the other folks on the panel I have I have adopted a life of of beverage
celibacy I do not imbibe however I did go to my local Smith and find Budweiser
zero zero calories zero point zero percent alcohol so I am standing in
solidarity with the LGBTQ plus community and with Budweiser and laughing at
everyone going over to cores without knowing that they've been here that's
amazing I have to also apologize dr. Josh I meant to bring up your amazing
book as well when you are talking but definitely go over to Amazon I'll be
putting all the links in the chat as we go through to check in everyone's stuff
but I just want to also mention that we have that as well thank you talk to
Jennifer all right hi I am Jennifer bird my PhDs in New Testament and early
Christianity I am somewhere between the full-timer and the Dan on this so I'm
partly partly employed as a professor but I'm mostly working on doing public
scholarships so I have a YouTube channel also I do little does the Bible tell you
so kinds of five to ten minute clips just once a week or I've done a series
recently on reading the Newark Testament stories through economic and
political lenses those are kind of fun for me but not as sexy as sex but that's
okay I also have yeah I have a website I'm getting ready to start a series or
a series of classes actually doing a little bit of a virtual tour of footsteps
of Paul kind of a thing I've taken those trips I'm going to try to make them
available to people through like a presentation we'll see how that goes I'm
not sure if people want that or not I'm also doing a podcast called wild olive
the tagline is game-changing conversation about literature culture in the Bible
and I'm doing that with a literature professor from Chicago she's thank you oh
yep on it's on iTunes and Spotify anywhere you get your podcast the yeah just fun
conversations yeah she's she's been teaching the Bible is literature for a while so
when I gave away a bunch of copies of my of permission granted she snagged one and she's
like yeah this is good stuff for what I'm doing so we've teamed up and it's been really really
fun conversations for us and I'm working I'm gonna start working on my next book which will be
before reading Paul read this so you know here we go wow that sounds like that's a good title
that's cool thanks we'll see it's gonna be a long book yeah it's like what you need to think about
before you go and try to agree with them you can don't have to you know like what people
let's let's keep these things in perspective yeah yeah yeah awesome and at Bible monger
Matthew monger how you doing yeah I'm good thanks so yeah I'm Mott monger as the Canadians call me
and can we go with moat moat because then yeah then you're kind of and you're kind of bleeding
into dr kill yeah that was that was the whole word I was I was I thanks for calling my joke
so yeah so I am um well yeah I do have a job um I'm
he's the only one I'm the only one here actually but yeah I have a job I'm an associate professor
of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures in Oslo and uh and I teach yeah all kinds of stuff I've
taught uh recently taught Akkadian and Syriac and Aramaic and a lot of intro to the Bible classes
stuff like that and research you know that's I do 5050 research and do um writing on Dead Sea
Scrolls primarily but then dabble in the receptions of other stuff throughout the ancient Near East
and that's kind of what I do in on my YouTube channel Bible monger I'm looking at the
yeah looking at the receptions of earlier traditions in the Bible and so I've started with
some of the Sumerian Akkadian background stuff and looked at how that influences the creation
accounts in the the beginning of humanity and then um working on now a couple more of the
reception of the receptions of the creation stuff in later stuff so in in the New Testament and then
in the Book of Jubilees and yeah I'll just be kind of plowing through stuff I think is interesting
so that's that's basically all I all I do is talk about stuff I find interesting and try to go into
kind of word by word text by text discussions because I I notice a lot of times people
say well I've heard I've heard that that's there but I've never really I don't really buy the
connections and so I want to show people the connections they like that literally the same
words like it's not like oh there's a couple of different flood stories and they're like sure
anybody riding on a river would think it's a flood no it's like it's literally the same thing so yeah
that's my yeah that's awesome and um and I'm also drinking Budweiser you don't know how difficult
it is to find American beer in Norway um because people I guess Norwegians like that when they're
in America they laugh about it you know about how bad the beer is and yeah I mean you can't get
light beer here because just just a Budweiser is a light beer you know I gotta say I I don't know
why the Norwegians are laughing I mean their beer is moderately better than American beer
oh no I'm not saying it's great but there's German beer right there you go does everybody
understand the the reference to Budlight do you think who's watching I mean maybe everybody does
yeah I thought it'd be good to to to be honest I don't fully understand it except for I saw that a
lot of like right wingers were getting annoyed because I was like someone can can you explain
maybe Jennifer if you know anything about it or I think Matt or somebody else knows better I don't
know um so Bud Budlight has been sponsoring a um a trans person who's an influencer I actually
don't know who it is because I'm so far out of American media and context all I know is that
I saw a bunch of of people on on Twitter um and on YouTube shooting Budlight with guns
and saying um mean things about Budlight and so I've tried to figure out what that was and
and it seems like there's a uh that that Budlight is is been being called out for sponsoring
um trans rights and so we are calling out the calling out by drinking by
Dylan Mulvaney is her name sorry okay cool Dylan Mulvaney thanks so I have a couple of quick
super chats because last time I missed one and um it wasn't good so I just want to quickly read
these channels as a result of that I was lucky to be raised non-religious the atheists uh this
atheist is grateful to these brilliant panelists plus the hosts like David Derrick and Neil for
enlightening uh enlightenment in religious scholarship fascinating cultural stories thank
you so much JC I really appreciate that and Dr Dan I would love for you to make a video about how
you relate and read the book of Mormon and your faith that's actually a good thing to mention
because everyone on this panel has been on Deep Drinks podcast where we we we have a drink of
the guest choosing and we have conversation except for Dan and Dan and I have been in the talks in
the background and we are going to be uh Dan's going to be coming on the show so I don't know if
we'll be talking about exactly this but yeah Dan can you um talk about that for a second uh briefly
yeah I have talked uh in the past about how I recommend people approach the book of Mormon
to try to understand it as close as we can get to how it was originally understood and I've said
you have to situate it within a 19th century framework whatever one believes about the ultimate
origins of the text it was articulated for a 19th century audience and that is where you must
situate it in order to understand it and so to get a better understanding of what's going on in
the book of Mormon get a better understanding of early 19th century literature particularly
Protestant literature uh but in terms of my own faith that's something that's a boundary I've drawn
around my social media activity where I don't talk about my faith I don't talk about how I reconcile
faith and scholarship that's just out of bounds and that makes it easier for everybody involved
including me good for you awesome thank you well guys it's been uh what three weeks like
about three weeks since we did the first panel um has anyone been cancelled has any like what
what happens the aftermath been uh since uh since since the last panel I can tell you that it was
very exciting for me it was the first time I was a part of a tiktok was someone grabbed like four or
five minutes from the end near the end where I was you know that was uh Correa I think yes thank you
yeah she anyway so that was exciting for me um and then I decided to try to start doing tiktok
because of that so maybe that was a good development from you know that's that's all I got yeah awesome
has anyone else got any like has anyone had any uh like people I know that we had one hit piece not
hit piece video but like one eight hour stream uh someone uh demolished our uh panel uh is that
Brian it only it only took six hours I cried I cried that night for a while yes I'm sure you took
it all very personally I did too I I had turned it on and then I went to sleep and I woke up and
they were still talking and I cried too so
yeah so okay so I guess I guess no one like nothing huge no no like we didn't have capturing
Christianity like call anyone up and apologize or anything like that any apologies for any
apologies no yeah yeah that would require back to your earlier point David that they actually
seeking the truth instead of defensive and their truth so I mean to say kip and I have a standing
relationship oh no um a standing um challenge is the word that I'm searching for uh Eric Hovind
was on apology his channel yep and he made a comment something I'm paraphrasing but it was
something I can't do anybody that thinks that uh slavery in the bible I think he specifically
said the Old Testament is something like anything more than like having a job or paying off a debt
or something is just stupid and doesn't understand what's going on doesn't understand the time
and so I super chatted and offered uh my services and kip services to help him out
not sure if he saw the debate yeah Paul Paul had to had to end that stream early I'll say
there was also a um well the myth vision podcast just said let's be honest Dr Bird kicks up the
butt and Dr Josh's bowtie is more than fierce than Martin approaching T1 all Paul just tremble
at this side and maybe that's the maybe that's the reason maybe that's the it's the bowtie
it's everything else so maybe that's the reason why you know Eric's not going to ever discuss it with
you yeah maybe what were you saying uh myth vision thanks to you thank you myth vision yeah
what are you saying dr kill no there was also uh more recently Frank Turrick was on a um it's like a
like a pastors conference um podcast and and he did a he did a thing uh talking about slavery for
for a few minutes and you know retreating back into the into the tired traditional apologetics
for it that just simply don't work it yeah so yeah so last time I mentioned that we have this uh
we have this document that's um attached to this you can go to deep tricks dot com slash slavery
and put in your email and it'll get sent to you there's 29 pages of all the resources um and uh
what everyone has uh suggested um reading dr Jen has got some more things that we might be
putting in this so we might be updating it uh and that was my fault for not putting them in
seriously but we have these categories uh that we were going through last time and I thought maybe
we could start on them again I know we touched on the category it's not real slavery but did we
talk on the modern it's about the modern prisoners of war that slaves were just more like modern day
prisoners or football players than they were slaves did we talk about that last time
not thoroughly I would say I think we briefly talked about this idea that these were this was
how you prevented uh captured prisoners of war from revolting was basically putting them to work
I think that was something I've heard uh Frank Turrick say or someone say that this was this
was basically preventing an uh an uprising of conquered peoples which is is not biblical at
all in the bible if they were worried about that they killed them um and it was as simple as that
they explicitly says they didn't want the men to um to revolt so they just killed them
but still enslaved the women yeah oh yeah well the the women who had not yet known a man
that's because yeah they were the only valuable ones right right it's also interesting to me
how much that way of thinking just significantly underestimates the impact of being imprisoned
then or now and when I saw some of the comments in the the the teased out version of category B
if they really were likening it to being imprisoned today it just sends all the flags up right like
the whole issue of the same racism issues in this country at least right with the a white man saying
being a prisoner is in such a big deal um I don't know has he been to prison and has he tried to
deal with what it's like to live after being in prison and all of that like fallout like it's just
it's it's just uh gotta calm down so I can make it through the hour okay yeah it's just deeply
offensive on so many levels um to make such such calm uh statements that are utterly utterly missing
the humanity behind what they're discovering they're describing
you can't follow that sorry that's I was like I was waiting for someone else to say something
so um we actually I I think maybe a good place to to to kind of um jump off as well and I've
and I forgot I did this but I have a poll on uh on YouTube where I asked everyone like what which
which slavery apology would you like to see tackled um the the most and the highest um voting by 30
percent 30 percent of the votes went to that god was working within the system of time yeah so I
I don't know about you guys but I actually voted on the poll I did too yeah and this is the one
I voted for and the reason I voted for it is because this is this is where I see um most of the I
don't know if I I mean I would call it serious apologetics but this is this is where I see most
of the I mean arguments from from people that the I perceive are really trying to uh honestly
grapple with and and reconcile what the hell is going on in the bible with with their own
beliefs and I think this is this is invariably where they they they tend to end up if you
don't understand diacritics this is where you have to know
sorry and this and this is really no what did everybody else vote for I don't remember I voted
for like the third guy I don't remember it was he always picks me always picks
so uh so yeah what would you say to someone who just who who says you know that god was just
working within the system of the time I've heard uh apologists like my friend um uh Michael Jones
of inspiring philosophy he will say you know like when it comes to I guess this the uh um like women
women's rights in in um some countries of the Middle East you know we don't go in there and say
that women should have all the same rights as as uh as men we say hey maybe let them drive maybe
that's a good place to start just let them drive and then after they can drive maybe we can like
approach them like having jobs and then you know like we you know so you got to like meet them
where they're at what about the argument that some apologists might make that hey like gold was
meeting people where they're at well this this is a brand of accommodationism one
and you you can't really gin up any data to show where this is the case and where this is not the
case you just got to arbitrarily say I it works better for me to suggest that this is the case but
when god says kill them all what's what's going on there we're not working within that system we're
just saying oh kill every man woman child and thing that draws breath uh if god is required to work
within the system then what good is god and how can we identify those things that are within the
system from those things that supersede the system and are above the system because if god is limited
by our system then our system is in control and so it's up to us what god is allowed to determine
is moral like they're they're just so many problems with with trying to suggest oh that's
what's going on here but what about all the other instances where that just falls apart
it's silly yeah I I think this argument and again like people have written on it in the past 10 years
um I I think that it it hangs sort of on two things one is you have to see
progression like moral progression from the ancient nearystone law collections and what
you see in the Hebrew Bible that's step one you have to you have to be able to establish that
according to their their argument and I think that's incredibly problematic
um and I I have a whole comparative chapter now and did the Old Testament adore slavery where I'm
looking through all the ancient nearystone laws and the laws in the Hebrew Bible that concern
slavery and essentially making that analysis some of those are more progressive than the biblical
yeah and as well and and and some of the you know some of the biblical stuff is more progressive
right I what of course progressive I don't know I think we got to be careful with that
because when you have a text that's written later in a completely different cultural circumstance
like you know what how far can we can we carry that but um you know at least from the the
circumstance the historical circumstances of that power but um yeah I mean I think it's Bernard Jackson
has like a whole I don't know two full paragraphs on about apologetics in his book on um wisdom
laws but that's the first thing is you have to be able to establish um that superiority morally
particularly when it comes to slavery of the Hebrew Bible but the other thing you have to then
I think establish is moral superiority in the New Testament over you know the old
um and again I I also think and according to not my field and Dr. Barrett obviously could speak to
that much more um but I again I think terribly problematic um but I I think what ends up happening
is you sort of get these ad hoc rationalizations and I I think we're gonna play a game and I'll
be quiet but I think we're gonna play a game here pretty soon in uh in light of this I don't
know where we're gonna do it but it's gonna I think I'm just gonna call it uh the laws of
Bible and Babel um and we're just gonna read out a law and say all right is it from the Bible or
is it from an ancient Erestone law collection awesome we're just gonna see see how people do
I like it I that's actually super interesting one of my first video on when I started this
this uh online religious talking stuff it was actually I took a verse from the Quran and took
a because I read the Quran and took a verse from the Bible and I was like and I changed the word
like God and Allah and I just put them in the google form and I said who can tell the difference
and it's really funny like only a few people who were either in ministry or the Muslims could
tell the difference usually um but most people they they got statistically the same as chance
and they were quite shocked with what they found um they'll be really interesting Josh
no sorry I was good so you could do the same thing with the Dead Sea Scrolls too
yeah back when I used to go to church um I gave a reading one morning from the Choreo the
Thanksgiving hymns and I referenced it too I said one QH um you know 19 lines four through
you know 24 and uh and had people coming up to me afterwards going
you're gonna find this in my bible
yeah so it's in moses nine
I have a I even did a I quoted lord of the rings on that in uh in a commencement speech I did
yeah yeah so and it's the whole I deserves death I dare say he deserves death many live that
deserves death
and and people were like that's an amazing Old Testament passage where did you find that
when I was uh an undergrad I took a biblical law class and one of the things I still have
from that is um ancient Near Eastern and Eastern Mediterranean laws and it uh it arranges it
thematically so it just gives a theme or a principle and then shows uh all the different
laws whether it's Lipid Ishtar or Hammurabi or the Middle Assyrian laws or whatever and it's
fascinating to just scan through look at a topic scan through and be like this is all virtually
word for word you have it you know different words for who this is if it's a uh you know a
freeborn male citizen or what but um yeah it's all so parallel I'll give a difference I'll give a
quick teaser I guess um so I have two appendices in the in the new edition one is I give uh
translation and commentary for all of the A&E laws um and I organize them thematically
so that you can just go and look at them and then I have a second appendix that's all the battery
laws uh because they come up so often and I organize them based on body part and then I
organize them separately based on um the actual collection that it's in so that I can show which
body part each collection or which grouping each collection considers the most severe penalty
so then when you when you go to the biblical text and it says like 30 shackles of silver you're like
what does that mean when you can go look at the other collections and of course the
shackle might not be exactly the same but you can see you know it doesn't have to be you can see
exchange rates on this I do kind of get into that a little bit um but um but the other thing is I
I haven't seen anybody talking there are two laws one is fragmentary so it's sort of
a little up in the air but scholars have translated it um in this way but
there are two laws once from Ornama and once from Hammurabi in that middle broken section
that's what one of them seems to say that a master gets severely beaten I mean sorry a man a free man
gets pretty severely beaten for beating another man's slave which you know stands out um and the
other thing is there seems to be a law uh that at least suggests that a slave is not to be returned
if he's being beaten by his master uh excessively so you know that's sort of a problem
when you when you know for an apologist who wants to make a stand on something like Deuteronomy 23 15
to 16 uh you know it sort of throws a wrench into that so anyway I think there's coming I think I
can't remember it's the Hittite laws or the middle Assyrian laws but I think there's one where it
talks about prices for men and women I don't remember if they're slaves or if they're just
citizens for like being killed or injured or something like that there's one of them where
there is parity the the the price uh the fine or whatever between men and women is identical
and it's only let's say this is the one example in all of these laws where when there is a cost
associated with two uh equivalent men and women that they're the same um I need to look that one up
though I wanted to do a little shout out to the um the quote you put up just a second ago someone
playfully suggesting that maybe um legal abortion is god working with the system I think that that's
an interesting way of I mean I'm I'm happy with legal abortion personally but don't expect that
everyone is but thank you I mean back to the issue of law when it came up I was like oh
no it's great thank you know thanks Brian Stevens but but it's you know it's an interest like if
someone wants to talk about kind of back to it Dan was saying if someone wants to talk about
god is just working with the system will humans and the same people are also saying well but humans
are always treating each other badly it's like somehow you're not hearing how your own arguments
are actually defeating your own arguments because right we still have slavery it's not that we have
plantations on this on this country but we still have people enslaved in various forms around the
world like we are still doing that and so somehow this collection of scriptures has not led and
in particular Christians to go out and you know tackle the enslavement of humans around the world
like it's not working if god was trying to work with the system people aren't hearing it's it's
something to to bring up as well that this may seem really harsh like maybe legal abortion
is god working with at times I know a lot of people would be cringing and like be like oh that's so
like they feel abortion is an absolute moral wrong right but you gotta remember these these
people I will often um say it's okay to kill infants that are maybe under a year old like
in the Old Testament where god you know went to you know kill the Amalekites or the um come on guys
that are the other groups uh you know that you know go and kill the nations you know kill the
infants of the nations around you so like anyway um yeah yeah so it's like it's it's harsh but like
even if you consider this as harsh even if you're opposed to abortion you have to like well look
back at the what you know but if you say god was working in the time back then then yeah well why
can't god work in the time now like it it sounds okay it felt like a troll comment to me like a
funny like comment but it's actually a good point and if and if people are pushing for change who's
to say they're pushing for god's side or against god's side I mean that's always something that's
just arbitrarily decided on this is just whatever side your dogma puts you on that's the side you're
gonna insist is god's side but you have no way of of determining that and this is an issue I have
with people who who criticize me for saying oh you don't allow for you know the possibility of
prophecy that's what's wrong with critical scholarship is we can't accurately understand the text
because we don't allow for uh prophecy and my response is always once you allow for it anywhere
you must allow for it everywhere and I think it's a similar situation here once you say oh that's
just god working in the system you have you have given up your ability to say anything is not god
working within the system uh and and ultimately everything is going to be a retreat to identity
politics and this is what my group likes so that's what god likes uh and you can't engage with
the the data on their own terms it's always about uh as was introduced in the very beginning
there's a predetermined concept or or uh argument or position and it's just about it's not about
following the data where they lead it's about getting around the data to arrive at that predetermined
goal data over dogma podcast that's where everyone needs to go
really great question just just as you answer that but she asked what is the strange religious
law anyone has come across and maybe people can comment down below thank you D so much for 20
dollar um superchar I really appreciate it I was gonna I'd like to say a few things about um yeah
about this particular this this idea of progression um in the first place because it
brings to mind there was a um most recently there was a debate with between uh Aaron
Raw and uh uh commerce contender about slavery and uh and and this is the approach that uh that
William took that's that's a commerce contender and I feel like this is this is a place where
apologists often will pitch their tent is in uh this passage uh from the gospels about how uh you
know Jesus permitted or Jesus talks about the permission of of divorce um which is an indication
that uh you know this is this is not the ideal that we have to actually go all the way back to
the Garden of Eden to see what the ideal was um for people and there was no slavery
in the Garden of Eden which is just which is just patently wrong because I feel like
people people have a tendency because they don't carefully read the text they have a tendency to
to think of the Garden of Eden as a place that that Yahweh God created for people
and that's not what's going on there the it's his garden it's his place uh he creates the people
and the text tells us specifically what they're there for they're there to serve and to keep
the Garden and the two words that the word that that tends to be translated serve is is uh
is the verb avad which is the same word from which the noun evad or slave and avda for um
you know the feminine form are derived so this is slavery this is divinely mandated slavery by which
the people are enslaved to the land and you know it it's pretty clearly spelled out within this
story because if you read the story all the way through what happens is there's a transfer of
ownership in a respect from this service this slavery to the Garden itself uh what happens
when they leave the Garden is the people then become slaves of their you know the the land itself
by their toil they have to they they have to uh it's the only way they can survive so um it's
it's always frustrating when uh when people misread the text in an effort to make these arguments
um and and it's also frustrating to to see people enter these debates and talk about how
they read josh's book and uh he just agrees with them on everything so yeah that yeah one of the
big difficulties and this is something i think that is is worth pointing out here is that it's not
it's not easy to read um critical scholarship and just get it speak for yourself right i mean
obviously david but um the rest of us now i so um uh there's a book that gets cited all the time
and i'm thinking i've got it downstairs uh sorry but it's uh maybe maybe i have it let
me oh wait i don't have any books thank you as you're finding that book thank you skeptic
and scoundrels ding ding round two of this noble endeavor biblical slavery is such a
home run defeat against the idea of an omnibilibut at yaoi watching apologist twists into knots
defending it brings me great amusement um thanks thank you so it's this one
Slaves and Households and H neary's edited by laura culbertson it's so so one of the things
that happens all the time is that people say it's laura culbertson writing it and then they'll quote
anywhere in the book i'm not saying the converse said that but like there are other people i'm
thinking of and it's like andrea serri's article that they're quoting or something but um that the
thing is they're using they're using household as the um sort of as the framework right if you
think about the use of slave in the ancient near east there are all kinds of different contexts
in which slaves can appear right you know like a king can be a slave uh or a human can be a slave
to a god or you have palace slaves or you have household slaves and so what they're doing is
that they're they're trying to focus and say we're going to look at slaves in the household
that's how we're going to narrow this down so that we can try to in the same way that one might
say we're going to look at slaves in the old Babylonian period or want to look at slaves in
the new assyrian empire or whatever um but the the problem is that that causes confusion
one for a lot of people um just that point in and of itself but there's a there's a quote
in the introduction the introductory chapter by calbertson where she she talks about uh the
definition of slavery and how it's so difficult to define it and paraphrasing she says something
akin to um like we don't have a definition of slavery and that's often interpreted by people
to mean oh there is no slavery right right no it in the same way that there's no one definition of
run like what what would that one definition of run be right because that incorporates a
refrigerator running and a car running and a person running and a person jogging and a person
sprinting and your nose running like what is the one overarching definition that's that would be
really tricky to do i think um well if i may if i may butt in briefly this is this is the center of
a lot of research that i do the fact that the notion that we can define conceptual categories
is fallacious because uh traditional definitions the process of defining is a process of gathering
all the members of a given category and then trying to reduce them down to the shortest list
of features or conditions that are necessary for inclusion in the category and sufficient for
distinction from all other categories and this assumption that uh any category can be reduced
down to a short list of necessary and sufficient features requires that a category be built on
shared features and that's simply not how humans create learn or use conceptual categories there's
been there have been decades of cognitive research on this that demonstrate humans learn categories
by developing what we call a cognitive exemplar or a prototype and this is very close to Plato's idea
of a form by seeing things being used we gain all these experiences with things that are labeled
this way and we subconsciously develop this cognitive exemplar and then something is a member
of that category if we perceive sufficient proximity to that prototype which means category
membership is graded which is the the foundation of this research a bunch of researchers found out
hey there is fruit that is consistently considered a good example of fruit and consistently considered
a bad example of fruit like figs and avocados not figs avocados olives uh these tomatoes tomatoes
these are things that it's like man not really and and because we don't create categories with
these necessary and sufficient features and in illustration I always do have this when people
are like well you can't define that that means you know it doesn't exist whatever nobody I have
asked literally hundreds of people in over a decade to define furniture for me on the spot and no one
has ever come remotely close to any definition in any dictionary that I have ever read everybody
knows what furniture is but you didn't look it up in a dictionary you just have enough experience
seeing things being labeled furniture and what definitions do is they create boundaries around
something they say it is 100 percent the thing until this boundary it is zero percent the thing on
the other side of this boundary it creates a dichotomy a binary and that is very useful for
structuring power and so if you have a definition you can say here is the boundary the problem is
that is not how conceptual categories work so you cannot define slavery if you try to
really what you're doing is just saying I'm proposing we put the boundary here and that
boundary is going to be violated and when people try to insist that the boundaries are are firm
or strong or clear that's just saying I need it to be there in order for my structuring of power to
hold so I I when people are like we'll define that I go no you can't define it and that upsets
them more than anything else in the world but the reality is these categories that build on
social constructs these conceptual categories you can't really define them
effectively empirically objectively you can just assert that there's a boundary there so
that was my rant sorry about that no that was great Josh but I just wanted to give that little
when people talk about not being able to define slavery that doesn't mean there's anything wrong
with the category that just means it's a it's a conceptual category and just like furniture
or game or god or woman racism or any of those male you cannot reduce it to necessary and sufficient
features apologies go ahead that's that's amazing uh that guys we're we're going to this is quickly
the time is quickly um catching up with us uh we're only going to be doing about 90 minutes
today uh maybe up to two hours if we can if we if um maybe not all guests can stay
but I did want to say if you do have any questions make sure to super chat them and like this stream
let's um let's push the stream out to send this to your fundamentalist auntie send this to your
lazy stepdad you know just do do whatever you can and if you like the content like this um we
have some amazing panels coming up we have a panel on purity culture called purity culture horror
stories with this lovely group of people um which you can check out that'll be happening at the end
of the month and we'll be doing a charity stream in the future let me just quickly before we move on
to some q and a let me just quickly show a quick um trailer for this purity uh purity uh purity
culture horror stories panel
every man's battle I love that that's great I remember that book I talk I think you talk about
that book as well Josh has been your past I did as well it definitely ruined a lot of my life so
yeah isn't that where the eye bounce comes from that's where I think that's where I learned it you
know where you know what the eye bounce you're like driving along and there's a pretty girl walking
and you bounce your eyes over it I think that's where I got it yeah it's uh and what's what's to
be interesting about the panel not to keep going on about another panel moment on this panel but
I've noticed that having conversations on deep drinks there is a very different different
perspective between um someone like a woman growing up in purity culture and a man growing
up in purity culture it's very like and they both have their problems like I'm not saying one's worse
but the other like it's just it's but they're just it's just wild and um because it's so unhealthy
there's no way around it it's just so unhealthy so of course it's problematic for everyone you know
yeah yeah so um but thank you um I want to grab just something we're looking at the comments here
that that it seems like um not everyone is convinced by Dan's uh a very astute cognitive
linguistic uh explanation of categories um so I think we should take just take that and then look
back at the slavery thing so that we make it clear that we're not avoiding talking about slavery
or the word slave or or anything like that but that we're we're using um we're using cognitive
science to help us understand why you can't just write off the question by saying well my definition
of a slave is what was in the antebellum south yeah therefore what's in the bible isn't slavery
and so what we're saying is that by picking one definition that you decide what are the
necessary and sufficient uh items that will be in your list of things that then excludes the bible
we're saying that is not a valid way of using definitions exactly well and that was something
that came up I think last time the idea that it's not race-based right or something like that and
it's like well that so that's the person drawing that boundary so that they can leave uh biblical
slavery on the outside and that is a fallacy but by the way even the concept of race biblically
speaking is is being interrogated and is it's I think I can't speak to it entirely the Hebrew
bible of course but we do see the racialization of humans in the newer testament writings I mean
that's that's actually part of what's happening um in the creation of this group called christians
much less in some other things that we see in new testament writing so even when people say
you know in biblical times I won't step on Hebrew bible toes it wasn't race-based that's
actually also not entirely true well and that's a different conceptualization of race as sure but
not based on skin color but on other things but yeah that's I should have been more clear about
that racial yeah well here we go a perfect example of what you're trying to say right yeah I never I
never understand that it's shocking for someone to say it's not I mean so okay you have to define
race and then we get into the whole same problem but then if people are using the word race to only
mean skin color right that's not what yeah so and okay that's fine that if we're only talking about
skin color and their argument is you would never tell the difference between an israelite slave
and another slave because their skins would be similar colors that's not that's not
how I think of race but that's fine we can we don't need to find there if we want to talk about
inclusive or exclusive that's this right then the bible the old testament is very clear
your fellow israelites you don't make slaves for eternity but your other people's living
among you you can make them slaves man and and so it's yeah josh can fill in the blanks on my bad
there's still all kinds of othering that's going on throughout the heaver bible and I think it's
interesting that the once we get to Deutero Isaiah and we have expanded Adonis sovereignty to the
whole earth now we've got to grapple with oh great now everybody's included how are we gonna
reconcile everything that's come before which is very ethnocentric in a lot of ways
and then you've got a kind of well chosen people the peculiar possession all this kind of stuff
and that's and even today we've still got to renegotiate with all of this and you still have
christian nationalism I think is a reflection of people who want that ethnocentrism and are
finding it in the early parts of the the Hebrew bible and then are paying lip service to the
later parts of of the Hebrew bible and then you even have in revelation it's like everybody's been
killed and now we have this new Jerusalem and all the nations are pouring in it's like we just killed
all the nations this is supposed to be everybody everybody's already here and we've got these ideologies
that we're kind of picking off one at a time with these developing these these concepts and then when
you try to create an overarching systematic approach to it it just doesn't work and gives people fuel
for all kinds of different arguments I don't know where that was going that was not systematic at all
so please excuse me I love I love this this is what we're doing deep drinks especially yeah especially
when the it's the it's the but why people wanted us to touch on the christian abolitionists helped
end slavery as if that meant that well I'm kind of giving the answer away but as that meant that
because you know because there are some nice christians there that means that the Hebrew
bible doesn't uh condone slavery so can everyone get a touch on that christian abolitionists helped
abolish the slave trade so therefore yeah and this just this is what we already talked about
that that you're using the social structures the social movements of your time and you find your
god and your theology uh how you want it and so finding support for that in the bible wasn't the
problem just like finding support for for you know statements that god is loved and that's the only
thing that's important in the bible isn't difficult for people today this is that that's what the
argument is is that that theologies adapt to social surroundings and then pine their grounding
in the biblical texts it's not the other way around and there were there were christians on the other
side as well exactly it wasn't it wasn't just uh enslavers and abolitionists there were those who
were more I don't know what they call them incrementalists or whatever that wanted to
kind of slowly move away from slavery rather than just abolish it and all of them appealed to the
bible all of them had passages that they could use to uh support their case and so to say well
turns out it's all good because the abolitionists were christian is a little different from saying
turns out since martin luther king jr was a christian uh you there's no racism in christianity
there absolutely is because it was christians who were on the other side of that as well yeah
there's a great book by the way I mentioned it on a tiktok video recently called the book
that changed america has anyone ever heard of this it's uh it's a discussion of how certain
leading intellectuals in america in the mid 19th century were grappling with origin of
species and the relevance to the debate about slavery and the origin of humanity but um it's
it's a fascinating book uh talks about monogenism and polygenism and and different theories about
where humanity came from and how it and uh justifying the enslavement of black folks even
whether or not we believe they are humans or descended from adam and eve it's it's a fascinating
discussion wow you know in this in this same vein i've seen i've seen people bring this up that the
the slaves the slave bible uh which i which i believe is is there's a there's a copy at
the museum of the bible if i remember correctly but uh the the argument goes something like the
slave bible um had to cut like 90 percent of the the text which indicates that you know
so much of it is about uh is is about reform and is about freedom and is about but i feel like
you know it when people have have difficulty as biblical scholars this is this is one of the things
that i i think we encounter an attempt to to correct and help people see more often than not
is that a modern understanding of the text does not does not align with a contextual ancient
understanding of the text and even even texts in which we have come to understand as texts of
liberation oftentimes are are are completely uh antithetical to that um you know just just simply
off the top of my head so much of the liberation promoted throughout the heber scriptures at
least has to do with uh liberation of a specific people from a specific type of bond is just you
know it's limited it's always just restricted to a single group um it's never challenging the
structure it's always just saying it's always saying we want to be on the other side of it
yep yeah or or i would say that what happens a lot with the texts in the newer testament
people are taught to read them through a spiritual lens and this is all about a spiritual salvation
instead of i did a like four or five of the last videos i've done are on no jesus is actually
talking about physical exploitation physical financial exploitation of the most of the people
and we're taught to read that as a spiritual thing not as and make it into an analogy so
even some of the texts that are about like let's address these issues are are people are taught
very intentionally to not see them that way because that would be make for a lot of work
james is a good example of that uh pure religion and undefiled is this to to clothe uh the naked
and visit the fatherless and uh but that it gets subordinated to paul and he said right that's not
really what james is saying right um yeah yeah and paul is unfortunately yeah the king of redirection
from what actually got jesus i think if there was a person blah blah blah worked up right because
he's just reinterpreted the whole message through a spiritual lens and it's unsettling
dr sherrill uh who's one of the original 12 deep drinks disciples on patreon asked
what is the most problematic assertion you've heard an apologist say regarding slavery
well oh right off the bat um i think it's disgusting when apologists talk about how
great the slaves had it oh yeah yeah i think they were part of the family as paul copin says in his
book they were part of the family yeah i think i'm sorry go ahead oh that's what i was just
sorry you keep going i was just i was just coming we we recently had somebody say something about
most slaves enjoyed being slaves is that that was uh yeah that was a tiktok video or yeah
i think recently right just within the last day or two so it's better than our own social services
now kind of thing oh yeah i mean and again i think some of the some of this goes back to
um just how you know just how much people people misunderstand how difficult life
generally yeah was within the ancient world right right i mean we have we have i i mean this is
we live in a virtual paradise from the perspective of a first century you know person life um
just by the the conveniences of life that we take for granted today and you know i i tend to
think this plays into it a lot you know and i i'm i'm struck by i again i'm going to bring in the
whole kind of the same angle i'm i'm just struck by how many different times and ways these comments
that are being asserted um are seem to be ignorant of exactly what you just said right to say that
well the texts don't say anything about x y z so x y and z weren't happening right that's just
ridiculous right we know what happens when people are enslaved and we know the things that go on
and an enslaved person is at the ready and at someone else's service 24 7 there i there was
a comment about the security that the enslavement would provide excuse me security like that's the
last thing that you're getting you might have a roof over your head and you might have meals
that's but that's not the same thing as security in terms of your own bodily autonomy in terms of
never like constantly being afraid to turn around like the the constant being watched the
constant all the elements of enslavement and also what you know what we talked about on the
panel which is the the given of sexual availability of enslaved peoples throughout the millennia right
so you know like there is there is nothing in that that says secure to me right i mean
and and and so when just just because you're secure as well okay yeah right right right you
know but like just because the biblical and and also just because a biblical text says
that masters are not supposed to do this or that or they're supposed to give their whatever i think
that was crazy but uh they can only give certain kinds of work there's one thing to say that it
says something that that's a thing that says in the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament it's another
thing to just be like yeah right and you think that's actually gonna fly like that's actually
how things were working i don't think that that's actually true to human experiences
the number of things about the reality of people enslaved in the first century in the you know
the third third century BCE like the reality of enslavement um was anything but this simple
candy coated loveliness you know dr bird something that you um with the the last panel
i was thinking a lot about this this idea of the sexual availability of slaves and a lot of
comments that i've seen um from pastors talking about the bible as well as as just non-religious
folks on twitter and places like that talking about marital rape and how there's no such thing
i don't know if anybody else has noticed kind of an uptick in the number of people talking about
how women are supposed to be or are required to always be available at any given time place
circumstance but i've seen a handful of those videos recently that i've been thinking about
replying to but it it astonishes me the resonance of this idea of that the woman is always supposed
to be available to her husband and the sexual availability of the slave yes and equity yeah
and so if if people are defending this idea today that women their sexuality is not their
own exactly what is the possession of their husband we're talking about slavery we are
and oh i just want to end this this goes connects to category c the kanah the acquiring something
i'm just pulling from the notes that i took from your categories so you know i'm not steeped in this
the way in the same way that you guys are but that's just you know kanah the list of things
that people those apologists are talking about you know so-and-so acquires a woman that is exactly
what she is she is property 3 000 years ago and oh by the way as dan very nicely pointed out for us
in a lot of households around the country right i mean the fact that the fact that
that 15 years running i know i said this on the last panel but i'm going to say it again
because i don't know if everybody caught it or understood what i was saying
the tennessee legislature i know shocker tennessee the tennessee legislature someone brought forth
the bill to say that a man is not allowed to rape his wife 15 years running and there were
too many men in the state legislature who said i can do whatever the fuck i want with my wife
like that was at the end of the 20th beginning of 21st century yeah right i mean so yes thank
you dan i mean i don't know what i mean i'm thanking you because yes i'm glad you're seeing that or
whatever and it's the connection is there ancient women in the ancient world women were property
sounds dramatically similar to the way the slaves are being the enslaved peoples are
being treated in the hebrew bible yeah imagine that that that continues right has the system
changed right are we outside of the same system or are we still within the same no it's definitely
still within and there's something i i did want to give a shout out to one of my actually one of
my four after like almost 60 episodes of deep drinks which is wild to me but with one of the
first episodes i had alissa whitbig alexander on and she uh she was she brought up in a very um
odious uh uh environment very far more than environment and they didn't she in and i'm not
running on the modern church obviously but she grew up in an environment where she wasn't
learned about sex or anything like that and i think she first i think they i'm not sure if
they first kissed on their wedding day or they first but but they definitely went until um they
were together to have sex for the first time and she was googling on her honeymoon marital rape
because she the the the consent wasn't taught in how in in the environment that they were brought
up with and it's like this was this isn't like 50 years ago this is like five years ago this is
you know this this still happens today and you know i had another um uh someone who left a
acidic jewish cult and in that group the the men and women were only taught about what sex was
two weeks before they were going to get married they had no idea where babies came from until
like their education was so stripped this is in new york and like this this is part of
the reason why i want to do this purity culture panel that and just not to get too super dark but
a lot of the women who would uh in this in this cult when they would when they would discover
what sex was on their on their wedding night obviously the man didn't know anything about consent
the woman didn't know anything about consent there was very can be very traumatic there's this one
hotel where there's three women jumped off the roof um the day after their wedding night because
they were so traumatized by what happened during the they were like this this stuff is happening
today still it's it's not this isn't just like um you know you know one or two rednecks you know
50 years ago this is like it's still happening and yeah it's um it's it's part of the reason why
i'd like to interview these people because i want to bring forward this this kind of um
this kind of stuff so exactly yeah oh sorry go ahead real quick i was just going to say
there was a bill introduced in utah to require consent be taught as a part of comprehensive
sex education why we don't have comprehensive sex education in utah the bill was defeated quickly
so this is this is still a big problem in a lot of places and this is mind you this is the state
that's passed a resolution condemning crt the same week that a young black girl took her own life
because of racial bullying in her school she's super rough um and i was just my coaching we had
it we had a question just a couple minutes ago from the something um and a super chat i think
that that asked with the strangest religious law um was and i think we're talking about it right now
from at least right of like or i would say i mean maybe it's a lack of law but but just the fact
that that the that the religion is so strongly involved in in protecting the rights of someone
and completely denying rights to someone else and that this is then actually argued from a religious
perspective like that's the that i mean it's it it is so shocking that this has to be that
this has to be a reality it feels like it's something that you would that they would joke
about in a movie like the matrix or something like that totally um but but that so like for me
that this is where we are like it's it's not always the religious laws that that are strangest
or most shocking to me but it's that we can't make laws because of religion the norms of the
religious belief that's not even delineated yeah but it's just inculcated into the way people
think and are taught to to believe and interact right and expect themselves or others and then
when it's called out that there are people defending that behavior and saying no we can't make laws
to protect anyone because we like it that way and a lot of times we one of one of the things
that people work so hard to do is to turn some of these ideologies into identity markers if you
can get people to think that their fidelity to the social identities that are important to them is
betrayed by their position on a given prince on a given ideology or question then whether or not
they actually agree with that ideology they will defend it literally to the death because of how
deeply ingrained our how how important fundamentally to our survival as humans our social identities
are that yes and and so people are now strategically intentionally making things that like gun rights
like crt i think the this architect of this anti crt stuff explicitly said we're rebranding we're
freezing their brand and we are going to poison it so that every time they hear crt they associate
everything that conservatives hate with it that's explicitly saying we're turning this into an
identity marker so something someone usually wouldn't have a big deal with is now something
over which they are going to fight to the death and that is is just horrific that that these
things have have become that and it's hurting so many people it's interesting that a lot of people
i feel like i feel like most people uh they believe that what they're doing is helping people
right like i used to have and this is just a random aside but i used to have a lot of people
a lot of pastors or not pastors but people in ministry with me tell me that they were being
kind by telling you know the homosexual that they were going to hell if they continued their lifestyle
because why wouldn't you what you'd have to you know if you truly believe they're going to hell
that's not something you need to kind of shout from the rooftops right so it's like it's interesting
that i i wonder if um a lot of these people who defend such atrocities are actually they're on
the side where they think they're doing something like good like they're they're on the good they're
not you know they're they believe what they're doing is a good thing absolutely absolutely
yeah um so this is this is one that uh one more one more kind of um
another area that a lot of people want to hear about was where do you guys get your morality from
and i mean this is a this is a question that you know is so i roll great back it's so i rolly
for so uh for so many people um you know myself included where do you get your morality from
but i want to kind of still man the position because i and get a response from you guys because it's
like a lot of people have reached out to me and said how can you say that slavery is wrong
when you don't have a moral like an objective standpoint in which to measure all goodness from
like how do you do that like if you if we are just molecules in motion if we are just you know
um just there's no purpose life if there's no there's no no one's drawing a line on the
sand and saying this is okay this is not okay where do you get your morality from
and i mean there are people here who don't believe when moral molecules in motion obviously
we have some people you get some of you guys are religious so it's like it's it's not this is just
like uh i mean i just don't i just don't fucking know i really know
so i need a philosopher a moral philosopher to join the panel yeah so i'll give um i'll give
the answer that i give uh not being an ethicist um and that is well do you think slavery is wrong
um and and if they say yes they say well we we agree we can move forward now um like yeah i i don't
know uh i'm i'm not a moral philosopher and if you want why josh why yeah but but it it doesn't
matter right because in the discussion uh if they think slavery is wrong then that's all that matters
here right because you you're you're then having to defend something that you know an atrocity
that you think that your your book um that that is something that is wrong that i am saying your
book uh or your religious position defends um and so it doesn't matter if if i think it's wrong
it's irrelevant um it's only from your position that it matters um but yeah i start i mean
i start that's my i take that as axiomatic from from what i know i say yes i believe that rape
is wrong and murder is wrong and slavery owning another person's property is wrong right uh i
don't i don't lose sleep at night not defending that right that's the worst of my problems that
i can't tell you why owning another human his property is wrong like i'm doing okay right i'm
doing okay so i think like for me it's it's important to distinguish between um descriptive
moralism and prescriptive moralism i guess like if we put it in those terms like so for i mean i'm
not a more moralist no a moral philosopher uh as they're called or uh at the cister anything like
that either but i do think about this a lot because um i i do want to be a good person
like i i could i mean i can make that statement i would like to be a good person and then i have
to think about how i would define that and that's how i would define that and what that means
has very little to do with my thoughts about god and very much to do with my thoughts about
other people and so uh while i can say that sure i learned a lot of things from a christian
um upbringing and things like that i also learned a lot of bad things from that and and i see now
that i actually treated people pretty poorly in some times in my life because of what i learned
to do from my christian upbringing and so uh for me being able to think what what would be good
i don't need to reflect on any relation to an ultimate standard of anything i can look around
and experience that sometimes i do things and it causes much pain to those people that i don't
want to cause much pain to and and those things i think then are less good than the times when
i do things which bring um joy or goodness to those that i want to be good to and and i know
this is a very simplistic way of looking at it that doesn't solve all of the giant moral issues out
there but i think um owning someone causes great uh pain to someone even though it might bring great
joy to someone else like i think there's a situation there where there's just it's not it's
not good because it's bringing so much pain and and i and again like being a simplistic moralist
in this i think there are just quite simply there's quite there there are values that we can have
that are completely independent of whether or not those values are prescribed by a divinity
those things we can we can work out on our own and don't have to stand have a standard
other than our own and it may be completely subjective but that's fine for me like it's
well and it's subjective for everybody even divine command ethics is ultimately imposing
its own will upon what it's interpreting in the bible there's the text has no inherent meaning
its own people are are constructing that meaning in ways that are going to be helpful
or meaningful to them and so even even divine command ethics is subjective entirely um and
i mean if you take moral philosophy uh even in an undergraduate level it's that's stuff that's
going to be covered pretty early on that divine command ethics is just one of a number of ethical
frameworks and it does not have the corner uh on any of this but can i can i just point out
because i i understand again i understand why the question is being asked and i think it's
important to you know to think about it but in a discussion about this with somebody this is 100
percent a dodge it's a way of them trying to get around what the text says don't let them do it
don't get sucked into a discussion about where we base you know where we get our morality from
it's in this discussion irrelevant in my opinion and i feel like i've had a lot of these discussions
you tell them hey you want to know about moral grounding go find yourself and you know a philosopher
that deals with ethics and morality here you and i hopefully are starting on the same foot
that you think that owning another person's property is wrong if you don't uh like you're just
more dangerous than i thought um but if you do yeah now now this is where we go from here it's an
absolute dodge i i would totally agree the um dr josh but the the thing that kind of bothers me
about all of this is that it's clear that it's not like people don't get the morality from the bible
like at least like like the the whole field of apologetics is um i guess two what two things
i'll mention one moral philosophy is not a solved philosophy like there's still it's one of the
major philosophies that people argue about all the time people have different perspectives
but two um if i go up to an apologist and say you know what about you know take the virgin
women for yourself what about slavery what about um you know genocide what about flooding the entire
earth you know they'll they will go well and they'll make up an excuse why are they making an excuse
they're making an excuse or not an excuse but they're explaining it because they know it feels
wrong it feels intuitively wrong that if you were to they don't want to be slaves they don't want to
they think it's wrong to own another humanist slaves because of the society we've grown up in
because the culture that we've been brought up in because of all these different reasons we have
this subjective thing inside of us that tells us hey owning another person's property is probably
a bad idea it's probably not okay it's probably not something that we should uh point out i was
stopped in the in the street by a street preacher who just wouldn't let me get away and after i said
ask twice i'm not comfortable having this conversation you know they just kept pushing so i took the
kid gloves off and i asked them all these uh these these tough questions and um and then
initially they said no slavery is not in the bible and i said do you have a bible i pointed
exactly to where it is and then they said well and then all of a sudden it was it is in the bible
but it was and they started making excuses for it but it's funny that their initial reaction was
actually no it wasn't it wasn't in the it's not in the bible it couldn't be because my bible is
moral and i know it's wrong because i have empathy you know so it's like it's it's frustrating you
don't get your morality from the bible stop it it's yeah so i just i just no so i'll be quick i was
i just wrote something recently um and i concluded it by by pointing out that the
apologist i was addressing uh cannot read his bible without first reconstructing it to fit
with his view of god and with his view of reality and that's really i mean that's really
the issue here and that's what apologetics is about right and this just goes to show
i i think like like like josh and matt and everybody is saying here that when you get
right down to it nobody gets their morality from the bible it's already there what christian
apologists are doing is just shoehorning the bible back in to what they already know to be right or
wrong go jess well i you know i was thinking of what dan and matt were saying um you know
i actually can say that i am a i'm a much better person now that i don't feel like i have to
live up to what the bible is saying and i don't have to defend it when someone
points out to me something that's just awful in there i don't have to accommodate it and find a
way to make it better because i'm free to actually look around and have some eyes and listen to other
people's stories and understand what other people are going through and learn from someone else about
what this kind of lived reality was actually like so that i can have a better deeper understanding
of what humans are doing to each other so forth so regardless of where it's starting
it's defending an ancient collection of ideas first is not going to help me be a kind moral loving
compassionate person it it has not been the case for me i have become much more all of that now that
i do not have to make sure that i'm not offending something or someone well i think it's gonna say
like you're on a dirty heathen like some of us on this panel right like you still you know like
you're a theist right you be your christian right i've never said that i have never said that on
any live podcast oh okay all right maybe largely even i don't know i consider myself a humanist
actually oh awesome i stay away from any label involving the theos because i think that is a
non-starter because we cannot describe or define that theos that you're asking me if i do or don't
believe or believe in or subscribe to it's just off non-starter for me so erasmus was a humanist too
well i don't know everything about it i don't know everything about erasmus i'm i was gonna say
i was gonna add one of one of the things that i um that i rant about quite a bit on my social
media is the assumption of univocality if you think the bible is a moral guide for anything
you're already assuming it takes a single perspective and that is consistent throughout
and that is just laughably not true which means that in order to extract a single perspective out
of there you've got to negotiate with the text and that negotiation is usually going to be guided by
as i've said many times whatever makes the text most meaningful or useful to you and these days
what makes the text meaningful is you and useful is whatever is going to win some kind of argument
whatever is going to make your social identity better uh or help you to defeat another social
identity it's it's all this attempts to structure power and so these people's morality is guided by
identity politics it's guided by attempts to structure power it's not guided by the bible the bible
is a proof text and they negotiate whatever they need out of the text in order to win those battles
that are that are keeping their attention at any given time or circumstance and that's not even up
for debate the notion that the bible is univocal is just laughable i've i've challenged people all
the time demonstrate use data to demonstrate that this is anything other than something you one day
said i decided i'm gonna think of it this way and it cannot be done if the bible is univocal then
every working biblical scholar would be just as unemployed as the rest of us here
i think the problem though is with all of you is that you're liberal hacks right
you're not guided by the holy spirit so we haven't grounded our ultimate reality and the
substance yeah that's right another another panel like how we trusted any instantiated
pre-subscriptional pre-step gation sorry also necessary or foundational basis of grounded
preconditional primary no the hackney even see things yeah ramen right under the cause of raptor
jesus yeah we're luckily covered by the spirit so yeah but so but i've been this is kind of tangent
to what what i've been actually working on for for a paper i'm giving this summer at a conference
and because the the question was the or the theme is the authority in the dead sea scrolls that was
the theme for this european association of biblical studies section that i'm going to
and and so my question is really is there any authority in texts uh or what types of texts
can we think of as authoritative because i uh you know there's a lot of research on lived religion
and and folk religion that that show that people don't get their authority so much from text as
they get it from practice and they get it from from interactions in social milieus and they
they're not getting it from having sat down and read a text and therefore they say oh this is how
i will live my life um but that texts become popular because they are in some way supporting or
tangentially um taking part in this practices that that are authoritative author sorry authoritative
there's all this budweiser getting to me
but so and so i think that is one of those things that we um we have to be really really thoughtful
about when we talk about these things like slavery is that people keep saying things like well it's
not in the bible it's not in the bible or it's like this or it's like that but but we have so much
evidence that jews and israelites and roman christians and jewish or former jewish christians
whatever we everybody had slaves it was this is like this is such an integrated part of reality
and so if our if we could look to the bible and say oh it was this moral guide that and god had a
progressive revelation that he got us out like out of slavery well that it it didn't show up until
way too late like it's like nobody got it and it's it's uh so we like we can't look to the
scriptures to tell us what was authoritative what was giving people their guide to how they
should be living like there were other factors in play that were that were helping people decide
what they should do or not and and so we we kind of even if the bible was um very clear
that slavery was a bad thing and people were still practicing slavery what will we do
like what would we do with israelite practice all through their history was to have slaves
and one text in the bible said slavery's bad you know it would i don't know but it's just like we
we tend to overplay scripture i think in all these discussions as something that was
right um much more meaningful for a long period of time than it seems to have been and so we can
just throw out a unit on adler's new book about the about the Torah being being read yeah you've
got it right there great and really good book like if if people are gonna buy one book that
that is over all of our heads that we'll have to read a few times to really really get um that's
that's the one as uh dr bird has had i got has to leave uh to go enjoy the rest of uh her day
so i do want to quickly just shout out uh you've got this amazing book i recommend anyone reads it
as well as your podcast and your youtube channel thank you i miss the i miss the youtube channel
but it's all right that's all right i'm yeah so is anything else you'd like to say before you duck
out jennifer i am grateful to have been included in this in this gathering for the second time so
thanks for having me it's fun thank you so much for coming it's been really great yeah thanks bye
jen uh and we have some um more exciting news uh dr dan mclon just released his first episode
of data overdog my guys go subscribe data overdog my it's in the chat there we're at
we're at two subscribers i'm the second one so let's see what we can what we can push this up to
the episode here is um first episode is just i'm 30 oh what perfect timing awesome well i'm gonna i'm
going to uh re refresh this page later on in the conversation to see what we can what the deep
community can uh can bring this up to because it's i know it's going to be an awesome channel
uh can i can i yes so one of the things that i have found um is that there are lots of people
that go on to their own youtube channels and make these bad arguments about slavery in particular
um but they they either don't engage directly with people like us or we will not any longer
engage with them um and so i want what i want to make sure of uh for people that are watching here
or people maybe that are watching later um if there are ever arguments that you hear
from people and you're concerned hey maybe that's a good one maybe that's something that
you know actually has some teeth and i haven't heard josh or kip or dan or matt talk about this
um this right now would be a good time we're happy to happy to talk about those things
but even afterwards you know certainly email us or put comments in the video here and i'm
sure david can get them to us but if there are questions i'd be very happy um if there are
arguments out there that people are like i just don't know the answer to this man i'd love to tackle
them here if you want and that goes back to something i said at the start like pull apart
everything that's being said here like we're we're not we're not doing the job of defending
uh defending a worldview here where we're just trying to talk about what the text actually says
when we're doing the opposite of what some apologists or apologists do by definition
so yeah please ask questions not defending a worldview no but uh i think we would all agree
that what we are trying to do is make this world a better place right yeah so and there's another
dodge right there speaking of that kip right in the side chat right right oh well you know
uh the bible can't be i guess is the logic here the bible can't endorse it didn't endorse slavery
because the panelists we don't know if they're actively giving money to charities to end modern
day slavery seriously i mean that's some solid logic there way to go tangelo i am converted
idiot uh wait oh wow we have all the infamous
i think he wrote a book hey kneel to grass toss and bless you sir the shot of turin
amazing so um hopefully oh you operation underground is not what is being referenced
there because that organization is not really helping to end much of anything at all
i don't know if any of y'all know operation underground no can you tell us a little bit
about it oh um it's uh this is uh this is a uh somewhat notorious latter-day saint
operation underground railroad sorry oh you are um it is run by timothy ballard who
has been trying to position himself as a as a superstar who basically tries to organize these
raids and tries to set up sting operations for human trafficking and stuff like that but has
used a lot of the money to promote himself and has been accused by a lot of legitimate traffic
anti-trafficking organizations of actually exacerbating the situation and making things
a lot worse um and even like selling well i don't i don't know what all the accusations are but
there are lawsuits pending and things like that so when people bring up uh being anti
trafficking anti-slavery and talk about operation underground railroad that is that's uh yeah that's
that's not honest that's not uh helpful
thank you so much nitty i loved the presentation of early christian slavery in the first panel
also killing it with the definition explanations from dam thanks
it was gotta thank the the bud wiser zero yeah and uh and on to langelow i forgot i don't know
how to pronounce his name um someone that's right okay i debunked on to langelow on the shroud
he blocked me uh and it's funny because he's complaining about being muted i haven't muted him
but if one of my mods muted him great i don't care i want you adding anything to the conversation
um so uh mathew monkey you had something to present uh so that you've popped it up there
would you like to talk about that a little bit no well you can just pop it up on the screen go on
see how the guys react all right
oh yeah
give us the context give us the context t-shirts are coming soon yeah so this is uh
this is my new this is our new banner i think uh our new uh we're gonna say our new band
and yeah and that maybe if you're lucky um but so uh but yeah this was one of the things that
after the after the last discussion about the about the diacritics i i got the i got the thinking
so for those who aren't in the flow somebody had had uh had said that the reason why
man um means everybody in genus or in exodus 2216 is because there's a a diacritic
a little mark above the s in the word for man and uh transliteration of the word transliteration
of it and so kip made fun of that in a video uh very poor of course i think we should be nice
to people we shouldn't make fun of people in videos so bad kip um and and this there was a
response made about this and and it was about how well no actually this diacritic is is actually
there and it then it made it the argument again and um and it really perplexed me because he listed
up like exactly 12 references that he said and these are the only places you get this diacritic
well that's that's really weird because the transliteration of a word that's used like
like 2000 times in the bible is is going to be the same every time it's transliterated so it made
no sense and so i looked at it and and i just happened to have written my ma thesis on the the
diacritics in the hebrew text of the of the bible and and i i wrote about the the accents signs the
tamim that are that are used to um they're used to help you sing correctly and we get the right
melody basically but my my thesis was about that they have a more linguistic background and they
help you understand connections between words and things like that and and so i noticed i just did
a quick search on the on the that that diacritic on that specific hebrew word and that gave me the
list that this guy was was spouting off about so it turns out that uh one diacritic so one little
mark um taught a called a darga in the in the hebrew bible which came six seven hundred years
after christ so there were hundreds of years after the hebrew bible was uh was written the text
were written these things were put on so that people would sing the right melody and i think this
one's like a falling melody so you're like or something like that i mean it's like it gives
you the melody that you sing and and this is has no bearing on the meaning of the word so it was
just uh long story short it was it was just very nice to find where the list of verses came from
it was exactly the same but it's uh there there's no there's no meaning to it and so then um i got
creative one day and made a logo and asked these gentlemen to join my club so yeah he also asked
dan to to to make a make a picture for the logo but but i didn't happen i i said dan should draw
something and oh dan dan went ha ha and and so i think it's great and then i did and then i did
my own circle yeah i thought you were gonna say and this is what dan came up with no no this is uh
this is not my work but i apologize for i i was obviously uh paying attention to something else
when that uh whenever that happened and so i was being uh wasn't paying attention sorry
this just makes me happy that that you found something useful uh from your ma thesis yep
i mean bro i really never knew it would come in handy um it did one time at a conference too
when somebody said uh said oh i'm in masoretic studies and i went well you're in luck i do know
i didn't know something so um i i do want to bring up uh again o tangel is comment here i
think it's a great segue um can i just quickly just say without on tangelo he's uh he says that
i did bring up with the shroud i'm just answering um to the foolish claims being made here be carefully
on tangelo anyone who calls the brother a fool is in dangers of the fires of hell matthew 522 be
careful my brother you want to be gonna be careful but if you could leave it if you could leave that
up because i think it's it's it he you know self-burn right those are rare um if his answer
to our terribly foolish claims uh about the biblical text and the endorsement of slavery
is to say uh a two quo quay fallacy i mean hmm you know yeah well you know you guys do something
wrong too uh i don't know man if that's your answer i think we're doing something right so
yeah what did what did even say i didn't know that we're not actively giving he doesn't think
or he would bet that we're not actively giving to charities that would uh decrease modern slavery
at good answer otangelo to the biblical text and their endorsement of slavery good one
this is the thing in australia there's um these races in australia where a lot of horses die like
the um melbourne melbourne cup races and a lot of horses die and they get quite abusive for the
horses and stuff so i like kind of came up against it in um on facebook and i had someone
like arguing me for ages and eventually say wait aren't you uh aren't you replying to this on your
iphone i was like yeah and then it's like well uh too bad like you know that was made in a
sweatshop so therefore everything you say is silly like it's i'm having i'm having flashbacks to the
r and raw commerce contender debate as you see yeah but like i'm sorry go ahead no go ahead
matt because i think no i just see there's somebody in the chat that i'd also like to address this
motorhead one or mature mature hey adin or i don't know how to pronounce that um but but so
i just wonder if they're gonna disgrace lemmy's name i shan't be having it so i just uh i just
want to say just go back and watch the last panel where i did uh i've tried to squeeze into a five
minutes the evidence that jews were practicing slavery and antiquity like there's there's just
no question and so this person seems to say that in judyism there is no such thing as slavery it's
not allowed to ask any rabbi and just um and and sure this is i mean we all agree that that uh
modern people people in our contemporary society that have a brain generally come to the conclusion
that slavery is bad and want to then define away the problem of slavery from their own
contemporary culture and also from their past but but it is there is no bringing up the the
the sixth seventh century right and so yes Passover is about rejecting israelites being
exactly yes yes we all we all agree on that and and yes it is preached and it's taught that that
also jews should not practice slavery now but there was a very long period in antiquity where
jews practice slavery and this is miami that's why it's regulated in the Torah that is why it's
regulated in the Mishnah that is why it's regulated in the Talmud it is done because
people were practicing slavery and there there's a there's a strong case to make that's our biblical
texts our earliest manuscripts were transmitted by slaves scribes who who were enslaved certainly
yes and we would not have the bible that we have today if it were not for its transmission through
enslaved peoples it's it's it's not a super chat but it's a super amazing question this is the one
i wanted to yeah yeah question for the panel what do you guys think is the best approach for
Christians who accept the bible condone slavery um thank you for being honest but also want to
respect the text as scripture and i imagine they say holy holy scripture or reverend scripture
i i get this kind of question a lot and um the the simple fact is that everyone is negotiating
with the text there is no one who lets every single syllable of the text stand on the same
level everybody is centering and prioritizing certain texts and marginalizing reinterpreting
or outright ignoring other texts and so you can respect the text as scripture and negotiate with
it in order to um reject slavery and racism and misogyny and all those things that is not
in any way shape or form lessening the scripture any less any more than people already do it is
absolutely inevitable because the text does not present a single univocal perspective
and so i i understand that that's anxiety but it's already happening everyone is already
doing it and so just decide to do it in a way that is going to help people rather than hurt people
yeah i like the way i like the way um tom stark uh approached some of these questions
tom stark was a was a student of uh christopher rollston uh he wrote a really good book called
the uh the human face of god and uh in it he likens the human faces of god it is plural thank
you there we go there you guys in your book what's the subtitle can you can you yeah super long
the human faces of god what scripture reveals when it gets god wrong and why erency tries to
hide it yeah it's an excellent book um what what i really liked uh towards the end and tom stark
is also still writing from a christian perspective here too uh and at the end he he draws an analogy
between the problematic texts of the bible and you know the drunk uncle that everybody hates
who shows up at christmas dinner you still you love your drunk uncle he's part of your
family he's probably a trump supporter um but like there's some you come to a point where you
where you recognize that this is this is what we've inherited uh this is what we have to grapple with
we still it's still part of our family it's still part of our tradition and we have to
make the best that we can out of it but the way to do that is not to is not to pretend that your
drunk uncle is is is not an alcoholic the best way to deal with it is to uh grapple seriously with
the fact that it's it's a deeply flawed text which still contains a a lot of um you know
incredible useful spiritual insight for billions of people without having to insist
that slavery is part of that um i think it just it just comes down to in the end recognizing the
you know that this is this is a human book um written by imperfect humans and grappling with
the world the best that they could and not always getting it right yeah i i mean i i think maybe like
a maybe not a perfect parallel but a good way to start is to think about how you would read
the epic of Gilgamesh and you know you might you might read through it and find some really
great things that you'd want to pull from it right some really interesting and useful for your life
lessons you know something like the moment that um Gilgamesh you know Enkidu dies and Gilgamesh
mourns over him for uh seven days and you know finally this this you know young man who's been
throwing himself at danger you know up to that point and trying to find fame and and to get
his name to go down in history and all these things uh very recklessly uh now comes to grips almost
instantly with his own mortality and has this sort of fundamental shift and now goes on a search
where he's gonna he's gonna try to figure out how to how to do it uh i don't know in a much more
focused or intense way and and and sort of recognizing mortality in that sense or
you know seeing how uh the journey that he begins in the epic as the epic opens in the same way that
it closes i noticing that the thing that he's been trying to do the whole time was there at the
beginning right it's the it doesn't matter that it's the city it doesn't matter that he you know uh
killed a forest guardian it doesn't matter that he outran the sun through it's that none of that
none of that stuff matters if what you're trying to do is sort of rake and shovel right rake in
the stuff that is good shovel out the stuff that is bad and you you already have as was said earlier
you already have an interpretive framework particularly for something like morality where uh
you you know that's not good but this is right and and and i think that we do this all the time
with literature and i think maybe that's a good way to sort of start and to recognize there are
going to be good things they're going to be bad things bad things um but that you know if if god
is using flawed humans and this is the evidence of their interaction with the divine that there are
going to be good things that we can draw from it and there are going to be things that we should
probably look past right or or look past probably isn't right but um take into account uh and make
sure that we pay attention to maybe just so that we don't repeat it right i think that might be a
useful way to get started hmm that's good doc uh constellation pegasus said super channel thank you
so much uh for the super chat did keep just insult trump supporters i don't know did i you made you
said something that may be interpreted that way you said like your alcoholic uncle might be a
probably a trump might be there's probably some alcoholic uncles that are trump supporters
but what the fuck do i know i'm a canadian yeah but i i really liked what josh said just now
about gilgamesh and and um and i think like so i i remember studying um like the classics
in in high school like we had to read classic literature and and like and they were trying to
like the argument from the teacher who who was like i mean i think i think he had an m a in you
know in classics or something and so for me at that time was like oh my gosh you like studied
more than college oh my gosh i was so i was so amazed like i didn't know what what he could
be a master of at that point but but like i mean just the the whole point was like he kept saying
like but these things have eternal truths and that's why we keep reading them
like they tell stories that that give us something no even if we're thousands of years removed
like the the essence of these stories is still there and so like and so when there's murder and
incest and stuff like that that's just part of the drama like of course we're not going to learn
from that but what we want to learn is the like the tenacity of Odysseus or we want to learn about
the you know the greatness of this or that and and it's there's there's just so much to be said
for that as actually reading things and saying how does this impact me and does does something
inspire me to be yeah to be to think differently or to act differently and that's that's an amazing
thing to be able to be inspired and and enlightened by literature but like the same thing i mean
this is the same thing for me is that i'm i'm just as moved or may probably more moved by by Gilgamesh's
um reaction and quest than anything in the in the bible you know i mean there's there's just
when you're when you open yourself to that and understand that and think like what happened
what did you do as a kid like i mean a lot of us were probably readers right i mean i remember the
first summer that i read the lord of the rings and i remember the feeling of like i could not
put it down because for me that epic journey the everything that was happening was just like i was
so moved by it and and so then i started reading it every year you know it's just like it became this
cycle and and i think a lot of people out there probably have read something more than they've
read the bible and been more inspired by it how dare you no it's uh it's true though it's true
like i'm i'm i'm a non-believer and i was blown away by the bug of our gita you know when i read
that drunk poolside in barley with techno blaring in the background over the audio because it seemed
so and i was blown away by that so guys we're going to wrap up the panel now if there's any
any last questions make sure you get them in but i just want to shout out everyone's stuff one more
time dr josh's amazing book and you're writing the second version of did the old testament door
slavery which i don't know why did it try yes on every every page just 10 000 words of yes
um then you have an amazing podcast as well as your book if people don't want to purchase it and
they you know you put it online for free which i can't thank you enough for for doing that that's
so awesome and it's not like it's not like the five best ways to read the bible it is like a thick
bad boy like scholarly academic resource it's it's awesome kip's amazing channel um kip davis
is going through the dead sea scrolls 100 recommend get yourself a few favorite beverage sit back and
watch this it's uh super awesome um and matthew mongol oh my gosh your um where's the uh i've
lost i've lost the tab but it's too much but too much but it is your your channel um i won't
i won't say that uh i'm jealous i am jealous um it's blowing up in popularity um but i'm super
happy for you as well um that uh that uh that uh you've got so much attention because your work
is super awesome um and guys go check out the stuff here it's super great uh totally awesome
so sorry can i can i can i say something else that i forgot on monday i'm doing um i'm doing an
interview uh for a podcast called uh ketem uh this is run by some israeli journalists at globes
newspaper um they they have a very popular uh heber only podcast uh and they've just launched
this english one called ketem and uh i'm going to be interviewing for it on monday it probably will
will go through some editing and stuff first but i'm going to be talking about um uh why
the classification of the text in the dead say scrolls has deeply affected our understanding
of what's there and why it has to change nerd alert so like genre classifications
yeah more or less it's it's my my biggest thing is this distinction right away there's there's
when the when the first scholars looked at the Dead Sea Scrolls there was so much
material and they're they're working from what they knew so so automatically you're you're
separating text from biblical and non-biblical and non-biblical and then even even within uh the
non-biblical stuff stuff that we know like first day in octubules uh herabiblical stuff yeah that
stuff versus you know stuff we've never seen before and it's it's created it's created some
some enormous i think misconceptions about what the literature of the second temple period looked
like um and it has huge effects for the way in which we we look at and read our own bibles and
and we understand the bible relative to to what's actually happening at the time of jesus so
