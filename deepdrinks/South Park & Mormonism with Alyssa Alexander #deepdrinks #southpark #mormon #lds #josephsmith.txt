Is it true that Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Moroni and then Moroni said,
hey, Protestantism isn't right, Catholicism isn't right, I've got some golden plates,
go look for them. And he dug up his backyard or somewhere near his location, found these golden
plates and then he translated those golden plates by looking into a hat and using these
glasses or spear stones and someone wrote down the story as he dictated it to them.
Someone was not convinced of this whole golden plate business and then took away the
manuscripts of the original doctrine that was written. And then Joseph Smith went away and
prayed and said, God's angry at you, we can't use this original document anymore, we have to use
a different document which would be slightly different in detail but tells the same general
story. Yep, that was fun. Okay, so that's actually like legit, that's a real, I'm going to give you
the South Park rendition of the story and you just correct me, correct me where I'm wrong.
