It was the intellectual honesty that I think, like actually, and it took 30 years to get
to the point of saying, maybe that's because there isn't anything more than the psychological
effect going on.
So that's a big issue for me, and there's so much more there to break down.
So that's the answer to tongues.
But in general, everything else I was game for.
I thought I healed people.
I thought I got healed.
I was prophesied over.
I thought I was going to do great things.
I thought I saw prophecies come true to me.
My best friend had a series of prophecies that seemed to come true for everyone in his
life, except for the one he made for me.
But then it's like, man, it happened for everyone else.
And it's again, it's that weird doubt, or is it just me being more honest?
