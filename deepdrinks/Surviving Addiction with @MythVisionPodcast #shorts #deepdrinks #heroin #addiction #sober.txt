Addiction becomes an instinctual process, it literally taps into food, water, all of the
absolutes that you need to survive, it becomes fused into that. Well, I know that's wrong,
but I have to survive. So now you're making decisions and doing things that you would do
if you were starving. I remember I was feeding so bad that I made up a story about my dope dealer
saying that they were gonna shoot up my family. My mom was panicking because I literally called
harassing for hours to try and convince her that this is true so she could give me enough money
so I didn't feel sick anymore. She said, I'll do this for you if you go to this lady who's in
recovery's house to get clean off drugs. So I'm five days off heroin and I open my phone and I'm
watching YouTube videos of this kid who was withdrawing as well on YouTube. He documented it.
If he can make it to 30 days, then I can make it to 30 days. And if I can make it to 30 days,
I might just have a chance at beating this thing.
