So there's a siren, right?
There are explosions somewhere.
I get a message on my phone, that's air raid.
So either drones or rockets or missiles, or maybe shelling.
And my city, Harkiv, before counter-offenses began,
before we took all the occupied area in Harkiv,
there were like five, from five up to seven hits per day.
