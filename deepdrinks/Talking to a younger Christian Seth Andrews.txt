I would use a lot of questions.
I would never make my younger self feel attacked or unsafe.
I would come to them in a position
where we were just kind of being real together.
And I would use I a lot and say,
well, I've gone through this and I've experienced a few.
And I'm amazed at learning this.
And if you're curious,
I would love the opportunity to sort of pick your brain
and then talk about this.
And I would use very soft language
because the younger self encountering the older self
would have probably doubled down, folded his arms,
put the walls up and said,
you'll never change my mind.
I'll pray for you.
God bless.
That's probably what I would have done.
