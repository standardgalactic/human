Hey, we might think this question is silly,
but the ancients thought it was serious.
Did God create Adam circumcised or not?
The answer would tell us as much about God's penis
as it would Adam's.
I know, I know, you might be saying.
Abraham was the first guy to get snip, snip
of the old foreskin, but in fact,
similar language describing Noah as Tamim,
which just means he's worthy to walk with God
as a whole or unblemished person.
So rabbis had clever ways to solve these problems.
How about Adam though?
They say he was born from the earth in the image of God.
So of course he was circumcised.
This notion has ancient roots as Francesca expresses.
