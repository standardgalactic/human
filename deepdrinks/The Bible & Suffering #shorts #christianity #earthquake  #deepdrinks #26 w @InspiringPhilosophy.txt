Which of these is true? Either God is all-powerful, but he doesn't care, or he does care, but he's not all-powerful.
So when people bring up instances of suffering and say if God is all good, why does he allow suffering,
it seems to me they're implicitly suggesting a normative theory of ethics that would be
consequentialism or utilitarianism. Suppose that maybe the actual view of ethics would be something
like deontology, or virtue ethics. In that sense, God's goal is not so much to reduce suffering
and create more happiness, but to create more virtue. This idea, to me, seems to paint God
as a moral monster. For him to command the Israelites to take virgin girls, obviously for
marriage rape. If that isn't from God, at least why didn't God punish Moses for that?
If I was God, I could see so many eras of the Old Testament where I would, even if people's hearts
were hard and go with the safe ones, like, don't own people's property.
