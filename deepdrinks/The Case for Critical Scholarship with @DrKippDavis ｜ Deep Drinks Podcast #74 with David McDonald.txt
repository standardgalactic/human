Welcome everyone to Deep Drinks Podcast. It's been a long time. It feels like a
long time. It's been a week but it feels like I haven't seen you guys and your
beautiful smiling faces for a long time but I'm so glad to be back and we're
kicking off a new season on Deep Drinks here. The conversation you're about to
hear started as a discussion between Kip and I privately about the inherent
dishonesty of Christian apologetics. I had an Islam as well but we didn't get
into that but I have beefed with that as well. I had a problem with the logic
apologists were using online and Kip had some big problems with the scholarship.
When Kip and I discussed some of these problems I realized how big the problems
actually were. Not only do I believe apologists of apologetics of any kind
should be scrutinized but I believe that everyone of them should be seen as
used car salesman. That is to say that if you walk into a lot they will always
try and convince you to get one of their cars. The question of whether or not you
need a car or if they have the best car for you and your family is
irrelevant. They have made up their minds and their job is no longer truth,
honesty, discovery of facts or open-mindedness. Their job is to get more
people driving cars, especially their cars. It gets worse. I think that many
apologists are willfully and knowingly deceiving their flock, making up false
features over emphasizing fuel economy, not mentioning the faulty brake pads and
hiding the rust. Dear Deep Drinkers, this episode is kicking off what I am calling
the anti-apologetics arc, a season of Bible scholars and guests who call snake
oil for what it is. If this is your first time watching Deep Drinks I highly
suggest you subscribe because coming up we have some amazing incredible guests
that we're touching on these very subjects. I want to make one thing clear
however before we dive into this. This isn't an atheist YouTube channel. This
isn't... I want to make things clear that I am by no means saying that there is
no evidence for God or no reason or people can't have faith in their God.
I'm just pointing out that the apologists online are being sneaky when
they're trying to represent their faith. When you listen to an
apologist they are telling you an unbalanced and often dishonest
perspective. So with all that said I want to introduce my amazing guest to kick
off this new arc Dr. Kip Davis who is a philologist and Hebrew Bible scholar
who specializes in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Second Temple Judaism. He has
expertise on ancient scribal practices. Dr. Kip received his PhD in
Religion and Theology from Manchester University in 2009 and among many other
things you may recognize him from his PBS Nova documentary Dead Sea Scrolls
Detectives which documented his part in discovering the forgeries in the Dead Sea
Scrolls antiquity market. In preparation for today Dr. Kip and I both read The
Case for Christ and ah, Kip has some notes.
Welcome to Deep Drinks, Dr. Kip Davis. How you doing? I'm doing great. I'm so happy you
use the music I have to say. So I don't normally do like a custom introduction
but you are like can we use that music and that's a Christian band right? Yeah man
so that is that is trouble. They were one of the first Christian heavy metal bands
and as you can imagine they probably they had trouble in the Christian music market
because you know they wrote songs like The Bastards Will Pay and they had no problem saying
the F word and and and I and I think they took a lot of shrooms too so
well they were fun yeah fun. There was so when I was like in the when I was in high school there
was like an ongoing kind of kind of debate you know I mean these guys are these guys are Christians
but they're I mean are they are they really Christians but yeah yeah but oh I love them
they're amazing. I remember having conversations about fight pits at you like youth conferences
and stuff like like the metal bands would be up there before the praise and worship bands
and they'd be like circle make a circle and like some of my leaders were like no it's wrong and I
was like no it's like showing the world that we can be fun too like you know like it's just like
you know fun mosh pits you know like and yeah we had big discussions about that back when I was in
youth ministry. Guys hit the like button subscribe and favorite send it to your
fundamentalist auntie. This is going to be an awesome episode but before we jump into it
what are we drinking? Oh yeah so I have to I have to say
um my my plan was for my next appearance on deep drinks to drink uh baijo but then you had this
total poser on who wanted to drink baijo and I'm like damn it no I can't
so um but you know as much as I love baijo and I'm I'm just messing with you Aaron I love you
you're a good guy. Yeah maybe only just a little bit of a poser uh so uh but but for tonight this
afternoon um we are drinking my very favorite uh Japanese whiskey which is uh Nika oh yeah from the
barrel um which is a look at this look how small it is this is this cost me like a hundred bucks
and it's like so small but it's so good like I had a little sip oh man I so I've forgotten how good this is
it's a single malt whiskey and uh I uh I'll I'll tell just a just a little just a little story
to get us going I I first had this with uh with a good friend of mine somebody that you know
Dr Matthew Monger and I were hanging out he is a dangerous man we were he didn't know I said that
we were we were hanging out uh one evening in Oslo and uh we happened upon a whiskey bar
and asked the lovely server what was good and what she recommended and she recommended this
and we we each had a sip and we were like god damn that's good stuff so cheers my friends
cheers it's um oh it's so it's so fruity and oh I I often describe it to people as like
I I imagine that's what it tastes like to chew on like an old oak barrel yeah yeah yeah yeah it's um
it's got some like sweetness to it and stuff and you know last time you were on we spoke about
metal bands for 40 minutes and everyone got mad so now I thought we talked about whiskey band
uh whiskey did people oh some people loved it did people really get mad some people were like the
actual content starts at 45 minutes and I'm like okay my breath but honestly I need to before we
jump into it I need to digress with whiskey whiskey scotch whiskey it's all like it's so it's so
interesting all the color comes from the wood and where it you know where it is all the taste
all the texture the same chemicals that are in there are like some of the same chemicals you'll
taste and that's why you get like oh I can taste grape or I can taste coffee it's like the same
chemicals oh yeah in the wood for so long it's um it's an incredible process yeah it's um I was
going to say it is not to be trifled with yeah 51 the same 51.4 so which is which is why the bottle
is so small yeah and um the the Scottish word for for for whiskey is uh the Gaelic word is uscabella
which means water of life uscabella water of life I know this is Japanese but it's I think that's
perfect perfect for it yeah I as much as as much as I like Scottish whiskey I I gotta say I think
the Japanese have knocked it out of the park I mean Nick is my favorite but there's there's a bunch
of very very good uh Japanese yeah it's um it truly is a marvelous creation um how do you know
what how to designer so um this so this conversation um you know we went through pain stakingly um yeah
God it was it was painful but it all started when so I've been doing some video editing for
Derek from MythVision and um just helping him out because he's just under the pump at the moment
and uh I edited this clip and I I immediately sent you a voicemail saying like oh a voicemail
saying you were so spot on so I just thought we could quickly show that clip so people would get
the context of of where did the venom started coming out of my fangs and then Kip's fangs joined
and we just watch just watch it's great let's do it um attention to apologetics and to apologists
and I think it was in that moment that I realized oh my god this is a serious problem apologetics
in my mind is one of the worst things about Christianity because the entire enterprise I
wouldn't even call it a discipline because it is not a scholarly discipline uh the entire enterprise
is founded on um on on essentially uh uh placating the feelings placating the hurt
feelings of insecure Christians it is entirely in-house it doesn't the the the goal of apologetics
I am convinced uh is modern apologetics is not about saving souls it's about making Christians
feel better about being Christians and of course the only way as a biblical scholar
um with so much of the problems within Christianity especially the more fundamentalist or
evangelical brands of Christianity are centered on the Bible the Bible is a problematic book because
of the history because of the very natural uh origins of the text and all the problems
within the text it's incredibly difficult for them to deal with which is why apologetics is there
so it's all about helping Christians to get over their their their anxiety about the Bible
and I think I'll just stop there but but I think you just hit the nail on the head so well because
that's exactly that's exactly what it is um and I I was wondering if you could kind of go into a
little bit before we dive into the case for Christ you could go in a little bit into um why
like what what happened like you said you're part of in this video and people should go watch the
the video on Derek's um Derek's channel MythVision but why were you uh why did you
did you have that perspective because there was there was a professor at the university that you're
teaching at right that was essentially undoing what you were like not undoing but like and tell
that story like I think I think it's important for people to recognize too that this this is
stuff that that I was already uh feeling very strongly about as a Christian I worked at a
at a Christian university um and in in the last couple years of my PhD program I was uh I was like
helping out with a an instructor who held a an endowed chair in theology at our college at
the university and he was an apologist and he used his position and his his courses
basically just to disseminate apologetics um and it was very it was a very uncomfortable
position for me to be in because you know I work for this guy but I was also part of the biblical
studies department and we had major major problems with him because everything that we were attempting
to do in terms of you know providing a critical historical framework to the biblical texts he
was working to basically dismantle um through these these these trite uh ad hoc explanations
and harmonizations for the biblical texts which at the at the bottom of it just simply don't work
so I mean I think I think that's where that's where a lot of the frustration that I have
for apologetics began there with his recognition that uh that this is this is
the this is kind of where I started to to feel like this is this is not about
defending the faith at least it's not about defending the faith to outsiders who ask questions
about it no it's all about defending the faith to those on the inside who are questioning it
so do you think it's so would you say it's inherently like I have this perspective that
it seems to be um like it's it's inherently dis it's I don't know if it's inherently dishonest but
it's um it's uh it's like it's it's not it's not it's not interested in truth
like inherently I'm talking about like bad faith actors like ken ham and and ken hoven and
stuff like that I'm talking about like apologetics at its core it's not about it's not about like
uncovering the truth and finding what really works it's about defending something
yeah no exactly right so it's um it's important to to recognize this too um it's not an academic
discipline so the only place you will go to find departments of apologetics or where you
can get a degree in apologetics are at christian colleges and seminaries I taught at a christian
university and we didn't even have a department of apologetics I mean there were a handful of
apologists who worked and taught at the school but you could never get anything like that anything
like that to fly and I think that that says a lot about about what apologetics is and I think one
of the things that that frustrates me uh so much about it is the way in which the industry
attempts to package itself as an academic discipline um and you know attempts to make
the claim that they're providing serious uh academic um explanations to uh real um
philosophical historical scientific problems from the perspective of christianity
but the only way that they can get there is by basically manipulating the truth
yeah so and and and that you know this was this was a little bit of a um uh I will say shock
because I thought that for the for the most part apologists were just like on the other side of
the conversation like they were just but but but for me like realizing that they were like no no no
like this is a game like um it was it was quite wild um I have an example of um
in the case for christ of where this is blatant in my opinion this is absolutely blatant but I
was wondering if we should kick it off with that or if we should kick it off with you have a bit
of a preamble that you kind of um yeah want to discuss so I think uh I mean I I think it's
important to to to get into like what we're doing and why we're doing it here so I think uh you
you brought it up maybe just off hand because I had mentioned something in that uh in that interview
that I did with Derek about this book and if I remember correctly the thing that you keyed in on
about the book that what I had mentioned about it was that um so for anybody who doesn't know I'm
surprised if you don't but but if people are unaware uh the book The Case for Christ was written by
an apologist by the name of Lee Strobel it was published back in 1998 and the premise of the
book is that he is a former investigative journalist who used to work for the Chicago Tribune
um who ended up embarking on a in in his mind and in his words a serious intellectual inquiry into
the quote unquote case for Christ the the validity of the claims of Christianity in particular
uh was Jesus who he said he was how can we know it uh did he die and rise
from death so that this is sort of the the premise of the entire book um what a lot of
people miss uh and which I have always found a little bit duplicitous is that uh Lee Strobel
became a Christian in 1981 the book was published in 1998 a full 17 years I think 17 or 18 years
after his conversion and he does say this right in the right in the the introduction
of the book he makes a point of saying that this is a recreation of his initial investigation
um but it's not the actual investigation itself this is something that is that he's doing now
post-hoc right this is after the fact um in fact you this is a this is a very very good point
that you keyed in on and we'll talk about it in a minute here but uh so it's it's 17 years after
his conversion he's already been pastoring a church for over 10 years at this point so it's
he's he's a pastor at uh Bill Hybal's massive church in Chicago Willow Creek uh so um but
maybe maybe it helps just looking at my notes here this is how he begins the book I'm just
going to read a little bit from from his opening chapter yeah and he presents himself like this
for much of my life I was a skeptic in fact I considered myself an atheist
to me there was far too much evidence that God was merely a product of wishful thinking
of ancient mythology of primitive superstition how could there be a loving God if he can sign
people to hell for just not believing in him how could miracles contravene uh the basic laws of
nature didn't evolution satisfactorily explain how life originated doesn't scientific reasoning
dispel belief in the supernatural as for Jesus didn't you know that he never claimed to be God
he was a revolutionary a sage an iconoclastic Jew but God no that thought never occurred to him
I could point you to plenty of university professors who said so and certainly they could be trusted
couldn't they let's face it even a cursory examination of the evidence demonstrates
convincingly that Jesus had only been a human being just like you and me although with unusual
gifts of kindness and wisdom but that's all I had ever really given uh that's all I had ever
really given the evidence a cursory look I had read just enough philosophy and history to find
support for my skepticism a fact here a scientific theory there a pity quote a clever argument
sure I could see some gaps and inconsistencies but I had a strong motivation to ignore them
a self-serving and immoral lifestyle that I would be compelled to abandon
if I were ever to change my views and become a follower of Jesus so this is how he presents
himself right um it's key here I think he's he begins his story by by noting that the the first
kind of watershed moment for him in this journey was when his wife Leslie uh became a Christian
and this prompted according to him this prompted his investigation into what he calls the facts
around in the case for Christianity so here I'm reading again he says Leslie stunned me in the
autumn of 1979 by announcing that she had become a Christian I rolled my eyes embraced for the worse
feeling like a victim of a bait and switch scam I married one Leslie the fun Leslie the carefree
Leslie the risk-taking Leslie and now I feared she was going to turn into some sort of sexually
repressed prude who would trade our upward mobile lifestyle for all night prayer vigils
and volunteer work in grimy soup kitchens the the guy can write um let's give give credit where
credit is due he is an amazing writer like I I was saying I said this yes he's just fantastic
like he really knows how to like he's obviously had a career in journalism like he's it's it's uh
it's uh it's it's really really well written um a really convincing who if you if you look at it
face value but if you look under the surface a little bit that's where some of the problems
start to poke out out but this is exactly this is a great point because it's exactly the kind of book
that you know what this is this is a bit of an anecdote but when I was a Christian I remember
someone let me the book refuting evolution okay yeah and I didn't even know what the fear of
evolution really was because I didn't pay attention really in school so I didn't really
know even the basics of it right well I knew generally the basics but I didn't know like
the evidence for it and I read this book and then every time someone would bring it up
evolution to me as a Christian I'd say I've read a whole book called refuting evolution
I couldn't remember one thing from that book and that book was telling me like like it's it's
amazing that it just gave me the ability to hand wave away all the evidence for evolution
because on the surface it gave me this like this this this thing that was like oh it's been solved
this smart person says so and that's what the case for crisis is done for a lot of people I think
is is it's like well they're interviewing Bible scholars and and everyone does does this sneaky
thing at the end he always like of every chapter he's like you know I wasn't really fulfilled you
know fully fulfilled so I just had to ask him like how has your scholarship affected your faith
in Christ like you're worried that it's going to like and it's like oh it is the one common
question that he asks everyone in the book right and they're always like oh it's built my faith
and it's and it's kind of like the the clincher so um yeah so yeah no you're you're you're on point
here um so I just gonna I'm just gonna finish up this this this bit here that I've got from
from his introduction he says instead I was pleasantly surprised even fascinated by the
fundamental changes in her character her integrity Straub was talking about his wife
Leslie and her personal confidence eventually I wanted to get to the bottom of what was
prompting these subtle but significant shifts uh um in my wife's attitude so I launched an
all out investigation into the facts surrounding the case for Christianity setting aside my
self-interest and prejudices as best I could I read books interviewed experts asked questions
analyzed history explored archaeology studied ancient literature and for the first time in
my life picked apart the bible verse by verse so that's that's this presentation of what happened
now importantly he also notes that this book is not that it's not his initial investigation
this book written 17 years later is like a reenactment of that and I think there's some
so there's some important dates here that we need to we need to to to put out there right at the
outset so Lee says that his wife Leslie converted to Christianity in autumn 1979 in another um
blog post on his own on his own blog he says that his investigation into Christianity took place
over the course of 21 months from the 20th of january 1980 until the 8th of november 1981
so if if you're you're you're doing the math here it's like a it's like a four three four
maybe five months span between the time when his wife converts to the point when he decides
I need to look into this and I suspect I in in other other parts that I've read and things that I've
I've I've seen in talks of his that he's given it sounds like he started going to church
quite a little bit quite quite some time before he actually started his investigation
so this is already stuff that's that's percolating and then on the 8th of november 1981
Lee struggle converts to Christianity okay so it was published in 98 he says that the book is as I
mentioned a reenactment of sorts of his initial quest he says that is what this book is about
in effect I'm going to retrace and expand upon the spiritual journey I took for nearly two years so
very importantly the people whom he interviews in this book the experts that he interviews in this
book are not the people he consulted in his initial quest like in in his his dogged investigation
of the claims of Christianity we don't know anything about that so this is this is a reconstruction of
that yeah and imagine imagine it would be a mess imagine if you talk to critical scholars or scholars
who like who were non-believers but world-renowned like Bart Ehrman's the probably most popular scholar
in the world like with so many we're like for the popular level you know it's like imagine if they
talk you spoke to them like what kind of book would it be you know it's it's interesting because
one of the scott one of the guys in his book Gregory Boyd was actually a student of Metzger and a
contemporary of Bart Ehrman at Princeton Theological Seminary they were there together
so yeah but it's it's true what kind of an investigation did he did he actually embark on
in the first place I've mentioned this to you and if if Lee Strobel ever sees this I would put the
challenge to him what I want to see what I think the world wants to see is that book I think everybody
wants to see the original manuscripts let's see we don't want to see a copy of a copy of a copy
yeah exactly but isn't that just the New Testament for you yeah right it's it's I mean it is interesting
it is interesting so um let's what we're what we're gonna do is we'll go through some of the
chapters and just oh you one more thing so there's something else that I have to I have to say before
we get into that so um Strobel has been criticized and accused of being duplicitous in this presentation
of this material in the past most notably uh I'll share my screen here and I encourage everyone
to uh go and uh and and check this out um this is uh this is the New Testament Review podcast
by Ian Mills and Laura Robinson they started this when they were PhD students at Duke
they've both since graduated it is an excellent excellent podcast but in one of their episodes
they did like a review of Lee Strobel's book and this was uh one of their their primary criticism
what I I just pointed out that this uh is not actually the investigation he undertook this was
written years and years later so um Strobel actually fired back at this uh so he said and I
I think it's important to point out I agree with Mills and with Robinson in their charges
that Strobel's entire charade of an investigation is duplicitous I think it is but I think it's
more subtle and nuanced than than they they indicated in their podcast I think that most of his own
counter critique is fair because they were not careful enough to nuances to nuance Strobel's
entire project because he does clearly spell out in the introduction and in the conclusion of his
book let's be fair here he clearly spells out this is not the investigation itself this is a
recreation of that and they didn't pick up on that or or they missed it it happens um there are PhD
students undoubtedly absolutely buried by comps and everything else they had going on I don't
doubt they read the book very quickly so there's that um I also believe that they are not totally
on point with the real problems in the book Strobel actually wrote up a long uh response to them
on his uh website I think I sent you the link I could uh I could include the link to that in the
in the chat or you could um and in his response Strobel ends with this I'm gonna read this this
this bit at the end at the end of his response to them he's very upset at how much uh repulsion
they exhibit for apologists and apologetics and it it both Ian Mills and Laura Robinson's
are Christians and the reason they respond the way they do are the same reasons that I had when I
was you know working for an apologist at Trinity Western University when I was still a Christian
um because their feet there seems to be in underlying uh there are some some some points
within the whole discipline which are just dishonest so he's very upset at them for for
denigrating apologetics and this is how he responds to them he says I should point out
that in the midst of their scoffing these two critics Mills and Robinson completely overlook
the fact that this kind of evidence what he presents in the book was precisely what the
Holy Spirit used to reach me when I was still a God denying profane drunken and often angry skeptic
and he used it to bring me to the foot of the cross to genuine repentance
and to a life of leading thousands of others to find and follow Jesus the last chapter in the
updated version of the book I haven't read that one but he says in the last chapter of the updated
version of the book chronicles several of these inspiring stories so I have to ask
struggle says what was it again that these two podcasters are so dead set against my conclusion
intellectuals bicker all the time and that's fine and yes the scholars in my book are conservative
because I found the squishy claims of most liberals to be ill supported of course there
are going to be disagreements and I understand that podcasters want to attract an audience
nevertheless critics should be fair and relevant facts should never be deceptively omitted especially
by those who say they are brothers and sisters in Christ so here is where I believe apologetics
generally and strobel in particular are being misleading by downplaying the reality
of their own faith convictions because I think I think for strobel and I think for
Josh McDowell and I think for uh Jay Warner Wallace and I think for uh Mike uh Mike Winger
and all these guys it comes down to how Jesus makes me feel and the kind of change
he has made in my life it's not about the intellectual merits it's not so my criticism
is that by downplaying the reality of their own faith convictions which have much less to do with
the actual historical reality of christianity and much more to do with their own circumstances
this is misleading also strobel's outright dismissal of the squishy claims of most liberals
and this this word liberal this is this is a this is an invented word by evangelicals this is
something that scholars talk about there are no liberal scholars there's just scholars it's woefully
uninformed and exceedingly problematic it's obvious from the contents of his book that he does not
even have a rudimentary grasp of critical scholarship and by hand waving at it like all
apologists do he is in effect being either completely dishonest or just ignorant by instilling
within his readers a false sense of confidence in bad ideas about history so strobel says that quote
relevant facts should never be deceptively omitted well here we are to put his own arrogant
triumphalism to the test okay so my goal our goal in this review is to accurately and clearly
point out those places where strobel is just flatly wrong and how these errors completely
shipwreck the project of christian apologetics okay that was my sermon well that is that fantastic
amen it goes to an old school but honestly there's a few things i want to mention one
how funny is the word scoffers the word scoffers like who use like it's this clearly for the like
ah i love a good scott Christians use that word what is that word it's 2023 yeah okay it's just
from the bible right scoffers liberals it's you know this is this is christianity 101 right
this is what it is so something something you pointed out and this is this is so clear
is it is it and i want to make this distinction and i don't actually have any problem with this
there's belief in god there's this i'm i'm i don't believe in god i'm i'm no longer convinced of
the evidence but there's belief in god there's faith that is separate to scholarship what it feels
like right now is i'm i'm watching like a uh a high school drama and it's like you know there's
like i'm watching like the scholarship and scholars and the apologists are at each other's
like um throats and the rest of the world is kind of watching it well the rest of deep drinks
is watching on going like okay who's right here um who what's what's going on who who cheated on who
you know it's uh it's uh it's like a it's like a reality tv show right yeah man and so um but but
so you have a very different perspective obviously because you're you're kind of you're like doing
the scholarship but something i want to want to point out is the problem i have is not this belief
like someone's belief here i'm using different areas of belief i i don't have a problem with
the belief i have a problem with joining it with the scholarship and pretending like it's combined
i just to give an anecdote i was walking home one day um and i had a shopping bag with me and this
lady was frantic she came up to me and she was and she was really frantic and i thought she
needed help with something and she came up and she said and i said took out my earphones and she
said i i need to tell you about something i said yeah why don't you guys oh jesus blah blah
it's hard to talk to me about jesus and i said oh and i said look um i i i said honestly i don't
feel comfortable in this conversation i um i would like to politely keep keep going and she
refused to acknowledge that and just continue on with her testimony she told me that uh god
had saved her from anxiety and depression and that she had a severe eating disorder
that was healed when she came to jesus and none of the other treatments worked she went to hospital
she went she did all these things and none of it worked so i listened and i listened to her tell
her testimony for a long time um and then i said you know i can i ask you a question about this and
she said yeah sure i said now i'm not saying this is the case but let's say that um i said but that's
all convincing evidence for you to believe in your god right and she said yes of course like it's
it's uh that's that's why i believe it's because i had these experiences i said sure i said if a
third person was to come up to this conversation and they were to say hey they had a similar story
hey god saved me from an eating disorder blah blah but they were too attributed to a different god
buddha allah krishna one of the three thousand different gods that exist or or maybe ancestor
worship or something else would that be evidence of their belief system and she got real angry she
got like the the the the the there's she started saying things like i won't even answer such a
stupid question that wouldn't happen buddha does does nothing for nobody i'll it does nothing for
nobody and i'm saying well why why would it why is it evidence for your god but not evidence for
someone else's belief some it might not even be god it might be you know um counting to
certain numbers or some sort of superstition or or aliens or or you know my my dad's looking out
for me from heaven like what what why is evidence for you but only it's evidence for them and that's
the point is the point is is they have this experience and a lot of christians will have this
experience i had an experience and i'll you'll attribute it to something but what i find apologists
doing is they'll have an experience or they'll believe in god for whatever reason they'll move
into apologetics and then they'll combine them as a as if that's the reason why they believe
in the first place ask any apologists why do they start believing it's not because
well i oh you know i was a skeptic and then i read the column cosmological argument and
i was so like it's not it never happens it's either the parents that were a drug addict that
became came to jesus or they were yeah it's experience first and that's the point the the
experience becomes the lens through which they read everything else right so this is and this is
this is the problem that uh that i that i had as a christian i mean you've got
ian mills and laura robinson who are both christians saying the same thing the problem
with apologetics is that the veneer the experience becomes uh the lens through which the scholarship
is done and you can't do that because the minute you start doing that it's no longer scholarship
exactly exactly but are those christians liberal christians
sorry what are the christians liberal christians the the ones that are the ones in the podcast
like yeah i'm sorry i shouldn't have interjected with a joke because you had that was a really good
but um so okay just i promised this was gonna be funny so this is gonna be funny yeah
took takes a while to warm up but the whiskey's yeah yeah he's taking back so there's something
hey hold on can i can i just say how much admiration i have for you um to have abandoned
you know the corporate world to pursue your dreams of being a day drinker
and spending spending your days hammered on youtube
well i i my new boss is actually in the chat i'll be video editing full time but uh you know
the more it forces me more opportunities to work on deep drinks and uh and i can drink uh at early
times of the day um i am like legitimately worried though i'm like is there like a biological
click that's gonna happen and one day i'm just gonna be coming up like i'm i'm genuinely worried
about that like i'm like is like diabetes we have too much sugar and you're like uh oh you're like
is this a uh is there some special in in like like is this uh can you get some sort of some
special hazard insurance for this like and she like and she like uh it's like uh uh working
in heights kind of like life yeah exactly drinking well you know my my job requires me to be drunk
most of the time you know and what's funny is when someone when someone's like i want to do power
rate or like some sort of energy drink or or coffee or something i'm like oh yes i don't have to be
hung i don't drink at 10 in the morning like thank god anyway next time i promise i was actually
thinking about this i was like is there an is there an unalcoholic drink that i could enjoy
with david for the next time i i i do his his podcast no that's i i like i think keep episodes
straight whiskey is great for keep episodes same with inspiring philosophy like he drinks like heavy
but uh neil the 604 atheist we're coming up with a time but he'll be drinking water um so we'll be
drinking water together so yeah that's that's all right and unfortunately i not deep smoke uh on um
have my glass of ice water um because i know that um i've a few guests have asked if we could smoke
weed and i can't it's not legal in austria and also it's all right oh yeah when it's when it's
legal we'll get we'll leave in the next couple years but when it's legal um we can watch me have
a panic attack um on future time so uh anyway something i do want something i do want to bring
up is um yeah is something that just left out of left out of me before we we'll go through
the chapters one on one one on one but i wanted to just give everyone a taste of what i'm talking
about when i say dishonest um dishonest kind of reporting dishonest apologetics so so we're four
chapters into the book we will go back and we'll go through one on time but we're in chapter four
okay and i looked it up i looked i read it the word gospel is mentioned 111 times up to this
point in the book okay the control f on the pdf um and so you get the the idea that um
lee strobel is talking about the gospels and he's talking to a scholar and he does this
thing in the book that i find like um hilarious hilarious i i wanted to do a reenactment with
you and maybe we came on rubber drunk was like it's like i wasn't i wasn't too convinced of this
and then it's like well david but like he's just very like he comes across as like being skeptical
and the person presents that and he's like well that's not good enough and then the person presents
even more evidence and it's like whoa like that's what the whole whole gimmick of the book is right
but what he says here and i read it out he says i'll be honest with you i said demetsker when i first
found out that there are no surviving originals now remember he's been talking about the gospels
when i found out that there was no surviving originals of the new testament i was skeptical so
you see the word new testaments there instead of gospels i thought very skeptical if all we have
are copies of copies of copies how can we have any any confidence that the new testament we have
today bears any resemblance whatsoever to what was originally written how do you respond to that
and then um the person replied um mr sorry bruce mesca sorry replied we have copies commencing
within a couple of generations from the writings of the original whereas in the case for other
ancient copies maybe five eight or ten centuries a lapse between the original and the early
surviving copy now that's interesting because i was like a couple of generations what like
like what is that like that's not like he makes that like it's so close last night i messaged
the slavery panel and i haven't been able to like the we got we got a group message where we
send each other memes and nonsense and sometimes some scholarship but i'm and i was like hang on i
was looking for the first complete copies we had of um of the gospels and we're getting into
like the eighth century because like they've been damaged and stuff and like this but like
we're getting like way into the tracks and if you if you've been a community member on deep
drinks you've seen that i've been putting up some um some uh some community um uh like quizzes
all just have all quizzes yeah yeah you can do quizzes if when you get to a certain amount
and this is this is one of the so remember one or two generations is what he says it's so close
it's like in a line you know in a lifetime so i wrote this the gospel mark was written anonymously
it was it was the earliest of the gospels of jesus according to consensus scholarship when was mark
mark most likely written so it was written 40 years after jesus died that's the general
scholarship is that that's in best right kip yeah that's yeah that's if i say anything wrong just
yeah i don't want you to be like like message me in the private like you're wrong here
the gospel and so then the next post right so this is so we've already got 40 years after
fact so you got someone and remember it's anonymously written it's not mark the disciple it's not
someone it's it's an anonymous source writing in a different language in a different location
about things that he didn't they didn't see that we don't know that they saw
40 years after the fact okay well you think okay well when what is the earliest surviving copy
we have of the first gospel which is mark of this book the gospel mark was written anonymously
40 years after jesus had died but what was the earliest surviving complete copy of the gospel
so not that we have complete today but like the one that like this is the whole gospel in one thing
one truck 340 years after jesus had died so 370 ce the like yeah that that is that it is that part
of the gospel this is uh so no what i have on the on the screen is is luke but okay but this is
this is from cortex vaticanus which dates to about which dates to about 350 370 and and mark
the the entirety mark is in there so but yes you're you're you're absolutely on on point here
so and just to give you so so um the first complete copy of mark shares about 300 years
after the original was written the earliest fragment we have so tiny little fragment it's
four verses on either side two verses one side two verses on the side is called papyrus 137
and he's dated to 200 ce 170 years after and this isn't like oh we had a copy that burnt up in a fire
and like scientists knew about like this is what we've got for the gospel of mark which is our
earliest gospel which doesn't mention the virgin birth which doesn't mention the disciples encounter
with the resurrected jesus which has another ending tacked on which like it's like this is wild
to me like that like this is just missed um yeah so and well and we will we will get to that
right like when we when we get to the med school chapter we'll talk about we'll talk about manuscripts
and this is something that that i that i know a little bit about and and and we will but i just
want to recircle because think about that though like think about everything i just 200 c e our
first little fragment of the gospel mark and then you you you you go okay that's that's what
scholarship says and then you go well what actually what metska is saying is and and it's like remember
111 times the gospels mentioned and then we're talking about the new testament we have copies
commencing within a couple of generations from the writings of the originals now he's talking about
the epistles he's talking about paul's letters which don't mention the life and times of death
and resurrection of jesus he's talking about like church writings he's not talking and that's only
that's still a couple of generations but you know me so it's being sneaky it's being deceptively
it uh deliberately deceptive he can't be he can't he would he can't be he can't not be seen as deceptive
in this in this case in my opinion like this is the category of something that earlier where it's like
he's just being dishonest he's just being dishonest here like he can't there's no way that he didn't
know this and he's no way that he didn't know that his readers would would read it a certain way and
go oh yeah the gospels we have accounts you know copies like so when when people when people find
out about the the manuscript evidence that survives for the gospels and like to give you an idea
i will show you every single manuscript copy of the gospels that date to before the year 200
and the reason i can do that is because there's eight of them so but like we'll get we'll get to that
um but it you're you're absolutely right like the um there's there's a number there's a number
of preconceptions that strobel um depends on in forwarding his case for christ um and and from
the start of it like he he begins his book uh for those who don't know the book is divided
into i think it's 14 chapters and it consists of 13 interviews or is it 15 chapters and 13 interviews
with individual scholars the first is with um craig blomberg and he is careful at the outset
to set the parameters of his entire um investigation on a couple of very key
important points in the first place he wants to establish that the gospels the four gospels in
the new testament provide reliable eyewitness testimony that we can use to reconstruct history
and he also wants to establish that the authorship of the four gospels um traces back
to reliable eyewitnesses and this is deliberate because you will discover as you read through
the entire rest of the book once he thinks he has that then he assumes it for everything else that
follows and this is hugely problematic it's a massive massive mistake and uh and and i will uh
yeah i'll i'll point that out um when we get into it so um should i think we don't still
well yeah we'll dive in out there's one more thing i wanted to say and i apologize to everybody for
you know this very long preamble introduction but i think it's good it's a bit kind of necessary to
sort of set the stage here um and i'm almost have finished my glass of whiskey uh so it's important
to point out that um god damn it damn whiskey damn whiskey uh okay it'll it'll come back to me
in in a moment oh it was almost there this is so bad um shoot uh that's it yes i got it okay um
this is the first time i've read the book yeah same i think that's i think that's important
to point out and i even like in the in the interview uh so i'll say this like in the interview that i
gave on uh derrick's channel on myth vision i mentioned the book in the in the context with
in terms of you know the story of how lee strobel ended up becoming christian writing the book
i talk about that in in the interview i did with uh with derrick lambert um i had not ever read the
book at that point but what's really interesting is that i knew a ton about the book even before i
ever read it in large part because of how much the book has been integrated into lee strobel's own
testimony and his own public persona right uh i felt like i knew every bit of the book and there
was nothing in the book that really surprised me except maybe some of the unbelievably stupid
things he says um but the you know he it's become so much part of his own public persona and his
own testimony that i i almost didn't even feel like i needed to read it in the outset to be able
to criticize it and that's not a good thing um so and i'll just say one more thing what kind of
to give you an idea when um i mean i i have relatively recently uh deconstructed like within
the last five years or so and when uh this first started happening and i had a i had a very um
emotional conversation with my mother about this uh this is something that she mentioned to me
she said to me she's like well she's like i don't know she's like have you ever
you know have you ever talked to somebody who knows you know stuff that could could help you out
to which my first response was mom i'm a biblical scholar
and she's like well what about this like she's like what about this book um case for christ
by least or what and i don't think she's ever read it but she knew she knew that there's this
book out there right and having not read it but knowing a lot about it my initial response was
like one of unbelievable this guy like i just i'm like you've got to be kidding me i'm like
without ever even having read this book i know this guy hasn't the first goddamn clue
about what he's talking about so yeah i thought that was important to uh to sort of point out
before we get into this so maybe we should do that eh yeah so um so the first it's a little
do you want to jump into the first chapter the eyewitness evidence yeah the first point let's
do that so yeah i've i've got only one thing to talk about with this but i'll let you kind of
like you can kind of jump into it so i guess what we'll do because a lot of people may not have read
the book they want to care about the book it's an old book at this stage a lot of people have
it's built built their foundations off of this but we can use this as like a broader
uh conversation on the points that are brought up so the first point that i guess we could discuss
is eyewitness testimony were the gospels uh written from eyewitnesses was the death
resurrection and chris christ fiction resurrection of jesus eyewitnesses are from eyewitness accounts
when he floated up into the heavens and is um presumably still out in space heading towards
heaven because unless he's sped up faster than the speed of light he would take him 30 billion years to
get past what we've seen um so he's presumably still out there he's not returning because he hasn't
he hasn't made it there yet to return back so um yeah so was that all eyewitnesses testimony
yeah so the way the way strobel structures every chapter two i think uh is worth pointing out is
he begins every single chapter by recalling uh something pretty interesting about a case that
he had reported on apparently he he was maybe a crime reporter or he was investigative reporter
right for the chicago tribune so like he opens chapter one with this this story about this this
murder trial right at the beginning as a way to sort of set the stage for you know what an eyewitness
is and the value of eyewitness testimony and so in the uh in in the first interview uh in the first
place he interviews uh craig blomberg who uh is a new testament scholar and an apologist um he teaches
at uh at denver seminary uh he got his phd from avardine university in scotland i thought it was
quite uh it was interesting to me it was somewhat uh amusing uh strobel points out that uh that he
graduated um uh magna cum laude from his ma program at trinity evangelical divinity school
which is the only thing you mentioned like you know if if it's not your terminal degree
graduating magna cum laude from your your your previous degree doesn't actually mean anything
so i thought it was kind of funny that he mentioned that what is that what is that
so there are it's not used as much anymore but but it used to be these are these are levels of
honors so summa cum laude and then magna cum laude the summa cum laude is uh and i don't
remember what the latin uh means but the these are these are ways of of distinguishing um
graduates with honor and summa cum laude is is like a graduate with honor and magna cum laude is
a graduate with you know distinction so i got a letter saying i was in the top um
top like five percent or like even one or two percent of my marketing degree does that mean i
passed with some yeah you probably you'd probably be like uh like a summa cum laude god dear there
you go man anxiety got anxiety of failing got me through that bad boy and my marriage
took years of my marriage so here's a here's the direct quote he says that uh he was a
magna cum laude graduate from a prestigious seminary which is trinity evangelical divinity
school and the note i had here in the chapter was that i find it amusing stirruple draws attention
to blondberg's district distinction as a student at trinity evangelical divinity school which is
prestigious in the minds of only evangelicals it's it's it's an it's an evangelical seminary
you know in the world of academics it's like we really we really should it's nothing special
we really should nothing at all these apologetic universities like these well one of one of the
things you'll you'll discover throughout this whole book is an astonishing number of either graduates
or faculty members at trinity evangelical divinity school i guess it makes sense i mean
struggles from chicago and ted's is located in a suburb of chicago so you know it was close by
and as far as evangelical schools go it's is probably somewhere close to the top so
you know it makes sense for him to have gone there but for somebody with you know um a critical
eye and and who knows the field ted's is a nothing uh podunk um backwater
bible college i don't know it's it's graduating from trinity evangelical divinity school is not
something you put at the top of your CV it's just not so yeah so all right so i witness testimony
i witness testimony all right um first of all maybe before where the gossips
yeah yeah go what anything stood out to you in this chapter and do you have any questions
that first of all dive into this this whole this whole book like i felt like my eyes are gonna get
stuck like because my eyes are rolling so because i was listening to it as a roll oh yeah right um
um but um so not i don't have so many um notes on the chapter itself for the eye witness testimony
however i do want to get your thoughts on like why do some people insist that there were
that there was eye witness testimony when we know the gospels were anonymous okay so um
um at one point in the in this chapter so strobel asked the question quote how uniform
was the belief so the the the one of the key points of this chapter is to establish um in
order to establish that the eyewitness testimony that there's eyewitness testimony in here and
that it's reliable uh strobel needs to first establish the the the authorship and blondeberg
affirms the traditional authorship of the gospels matthew mark luke and john all of which are anonymous
and then he asks this question how uniform was the belief that these four matthew mark
luke and john were the authors and blondeberg responds by saying there are no known competitors
for these for the three gospels matthew mark luke apparently it was not in dispute this is so this
is what what he says about the authorship and something that that he points to to establish
this fact is a statement made by the church father papias who apparently uh wrote sometime around
130 so this is 100 years after the death of jesus um so papias is very important for evangelical
scholars because he mentions specific gospels composed he says by matthew and he says mark
translated the memoirs of peter it's important to note this is not direct evidence we only know of
papias's work through eusebius who is writing about papias sometime between 312 and 324 so
now you're like a couple hundred additional years removed from even the life of papias
papias is purported to have been to have actually known uh john who was john the the the disciple
of jesus so but this is this is what papias actually says about the uh uh or this is what eusebius
says about what papias says about gospel there's like a vinn diagram it's like anonymous gospels
matthew mark luke and john written at least 40 to 70 40 to 90 47 years after the events occurred
and then from that you've got like a string that goes to like this guy called papias when
was he around once he writing in like one 130 ish 130 so that would be what's what we're yeah
so we're talking 100 years 100 years after the death of jesus um if mark is our earliest gospel
and was written in and around 60 i think is the the conventional dating so like another
70 years after that papias writes this he says mark having become an interpreter of peter wrote down
accurately though not in order whatsoever he remembered of the things said or done by christ
for he he neither heard the lord nor followed him but afterwards as i said he followed peter
who adopted who adapted his teaching in the needs of his hearers but with no intention of giving a
connected account of the lord's discourses so that mark committed no error while he thus wrote
some things as he remembered him for he was careful of one thing not to omit any of the things which
he heard and not to state any of them falsely and then a little bit later talking about matthew
he says concerning matthew uh this is this is eusebius now says concerning matthew he papias
writes as follows so then matthew wrote the oracles in the heber language and everyone interpreted
them as he was able so there's a couple of problems at the outset here and they they they stem
them very very clearly on this matter of language this matter of language is is is a major issue
um for christian apologists because uh when you read the gospels which are all in greek
and when experts in languages uh deeply probe the texts of the gospels which are all written in
greek they come to the same conclusion these texts were all written in greek none of them were
translated from aramaic or from hebert i mean we you can there are there are indicators within a
translated text which can you know tell you that this was translated from another language i think
it's much more difficult to detect that now but in ancient times it was it was quite a bit easier
and everyone is unanimous on this point the gospels were composed in greek now why is this
a problem so this is a problem because the eyewitnesses to jesus's life and resurrection
were aramaic speaking jews there were aramaic speaking jews from galilee which was in the
northern hinterland of the region and what this basically means is that there is almost no chance
that any of them knew a lick of greek and even worse most of them were probably illiterate if
they could write anything at all it would have been in aramaic um and of course we know that because
the gospels were not translated from aramaic then no there's just no way that you can get these
back to eyewitnesses okay so that makes a lot more sense so this is if i was a um you know
still a christian you know i would say it's a miracle that noah zark could do what it did or
whatever you know it's a miracle like god can do anything um is it possible and this is something
i heard is it possible that in their later years traveling the world preaching the gospel that the
aramaic speaking um disciples ended up in greece and decided you know what i'm going to learn greek
and write this down um like what's the chance of someone in their middle age doing that so that's
extremely low just by virtue of the fact that you know language or learning how to read and write
was an incredibly specialized skill um that belonged almost entirely exclusively to to the
wealthy and even if they had learned to to to read and write greek you could still tell
that they were they were they were they were they were translating this translating from a
and aramaic from in a semitic uh background and mindset i mean it was in their writing
can you uh what is semitic sorry can you um semitic is so semitic languages are like heber
aramaic um um i believe like old egyptian so it's a it's a language classification uh in which
both heber and aramaic both heber and aramaic are semitic languages greek is not a semitic
language ah so you're saying that if they did if they did learn to write greek you still would
have been able to pick up some of the you could you could tell um so now one one of the things i
will point out one of the things that scholars do when they look at the gospels is there are
now it doesn't come through in in the construction of the literature but there are a couple of very
small points in actual quotations of jesus like where he's speaking where there are remnants of
aramaic and this uh this is is is given scholars an indication that these are things that go back to
you know a very very ancient uh this is like very ancient core material maybe was something
spoken by jesus himself just because it it preserves what we call aramaisms but they're
just within like the sayings right they don't they don't expand into the actual
uh construction of of the gospels themselves so this is this is a serious problem now uh
something else i wanted to i i wanted to point out here is i mean this raises a question about
attribution like when do we know of blumberg says that there's no dispute of uh of gospel
authorship that that nobody else is ever uh suggested as an author like for instance you
know for the gospel of mark nobody ever actually says no no no this is the gospel of peter uh
for the gospel of the nobody ever says no no no this is the the gospel of that yes or whatever right
so it's it's uh what what he says is true but it's important to kind of track how this works
historically so what do we know about gospel attribution about the the the attribution of
the traditional authors matthew mark luke and john to the gospels and how early does this happen
so working from the beginning like working from from the oldest text that we have uh i start with
the dk which is uh which is a a very very old christian text written in greek probably around
the year 100 maybe later but the dk actually quotes texts from the gospels specifically from matthew
chapter six um and it's but it cites it only as the lord commanded so it never names matthew
it just cites it as something commanded by the lord and it's a saying of jesus right so that's
as early as 100 so the epistle barnabas was written about 130 it also quotes matthew but again
doesn't ever mention matthew's name it just says it is written justin martin might be our most
go ahead i was just gonna ask the epistle barnabas was is that one of the um epistles that was argued
to be in a canon but didn't end up in the canon okay interesting yeah so and probably because it's
a little late although there are you know scholars are now now suggesting that there are you know
contemporary stuff within our new testaments with the epistle barnabas so i have a question
you said you've recently deconstructed with not in the last five years have any of your
opinions on any of these matters changed since your deconstruction or this is just
scholarship through and through this is scholarship okay okay and what was the sin that you chose
what was the sin that got you to leave christianity it was a scoffing it's always porn come on it's
always porn that's why so many people are walking away it's the pawns it's the pawns that does it
all right no my favorite scoffing i love a scoff yeah okay so justin martin is maybe the our most
important uh early church writer just because of how early he is he's writing it about 150 so mid
second century this is if we're using the gospel of mark as as as like a starting point 90 years
after mark supposedly wrote his gospel so justin martin quotes from matthew mark and luke
and he quotes extensively from them so he clearly had these gospels in his possession so we can be
pretty confident that at the very least matthew mark and luke were already written by 150 um
however he calls them the memorabilia of the apostles
and of mark in one place he says he calls it the memorabilia of peter so now is that now maybe
that actually uh is a challenge to blondberg's claim that there is no nobody else was was uh
suggested as authors for these texts i don't know um but importantly i think it's important to point
out that justin martin writing in 150 does not know that matthew mark and luke wrote the gospels
that are attributed to them john yeah he doesn't quote from john um yeah ever okay so he apparently
doesn't know about john which is another problem all right next we have tation who wrote the diatisserie
in around 180 now the diatisserie is an amazing text it is a conflation of the four gospels so what
tation did tation was a was was a student of um justin martin and he decided to sit down with all
and he had all four of the gospels uh so including john and he decided to like combine them all together
and basically in like a chronological order so he pieced them all together as one large single
gospel just by combining all the elements of the four so and in so doing he omits doublets so
things repeated he doesn't repeat he just he just harm he just just like kind of massages those
he harmonizes some discrepancies into a single narrative but importantly again he doesn't seem
to know that matthew mark luke or john wrote any of these texts he makes no mention of them okay so
that's we're at 180 at this point so now we're 120 years after mark wrote his gospel and still no
mention of mark the moratorium fragment uh is an important list um of of new testament texts
it's dated to sometime between 180 and 200 and it for the first time knows of four gospels and names
luke and john specifically um and it mentions that there's a third and fourth but doesn't
actually name them so scholars tend to point to this date sometime between 180 and 200 as
like the first place where we have actual mention of the gospel authors so again yeah wow so
and before that i think it's very very important to point out what's very important to point out
what which blondberg does not is that the gospels are quoted extensively by justin barter by the
epistle of barnabas by the dita k but they're anonymous so they don't they're not attributed
to anyone prior to the first time you see when i read when i read the case for christ um
it it really came from case for christ right yeah it didn't it painted the picture that
it didn't paint the picture at all and paint it paints the opposite picture right like
exactly i'm so i'm so confused because
this is okay random aside what do you think's going on here do you think that like um
bloomberg and lee strobel are being deliberately deceptive or do you think they're like putting
a best case like they're kind of rose tinted glasses like that you know what do you think's
going on here i think i mean i think strobel's strobel's strobel has is just just following the
lead of the experts right so he's just gonna believe whatever blondeberg tells him blondeberg
should know better um and the way that he has couched this and i guess i mean you know how much
of strobel's interview with blondeberg is crafted for this particular chapter
you know when blondeberg says what he says which um here i'll i'll read it again when so when
blondeberg says um there is no there are no known competitors for these three gospels
apparently it was just not a dispute um you know did he did did he say yeah but you know
we're talking about 180 180 200 ce and we don't really know anything before that we just don't know
right um so blondeberg is either being selective or um strobel is is you know
manually he's he's he's uh redacting his his quotations his interviews so um yeah it's it's uh
so it is so yeah gospel attribution is a huge problem and uh i mean we'll talk a little bit
about manuscripts but is one of the things that uh that that is also important to point out is
you know in the manuscript evidence that we have for the gospels which is very sparse um until
you get a couple hundred years after they were written uh you don't even start to see gospel
attributions i think the first time you see it is in p66 which is admittedly an exquisite copy
of the gospel of john that dates to about 200 but that's the earliest right it's the earliest
could you so could you show us these these these eight manuscripts that we um do you want to do
that now i i'm i'm very eager to get to that aren't you yeah because okay because we're all right
because the manuscripts i i think it helps paint the picture of what we're actually talking about
yeah so i mean people should know there's there's a chapter there's you know strobel does a whole
chapter on on manuscripts that's chapter three um do you see it yeah so maybe explain this explain
this website so um maybe even throw a link in the chat because i think this is something people
should note about this is the center for the study of new testament manuscripts and at this
website you will be able to find pictures of um i don't know if it's every new testament manuscript
but it's most of them and it's all of the important ones so i mean there are thousands and thousands
and thousands of new testament manuscripts and um we probably don't have pictures of all of them but
you know there are tons and tons and tons of pictures of new testament manuscripts on this
site so on the on the left these are all liberal um potchments um yeah yeah there you go so on the
left hand side i'm kidding on the left hand side you'll see a bunch of uh a bunch of um
filters that you can use for your search so you'll see here i didn't even bother clicking
papyrus because everything prior to like 300 is papyrus i just said show me everything in the
second century start and end in the second century and show me all the gospel manuscripts do you want
to just click on that again just to show every click on the start again click on it uh not again
so just click on the start like where it says second century so right here uh yeah click on it
there's no first century started yeah look at that so there's no first century it's important for
people to know there are no first century new testament manuscripts none none none there's
not a single one okay so but when you put all the information in this is what you get gospel
manuscripts dating to at the very latest 200 here is the list you see this what does it say here
at the very top david how many results were found seven so you lied to me you said there was eight
you lie you liberal school no i no i think
some some of the there's some some i think some there's possibly a a disputed second
third century manuscript which which would be included in this list right so so here's i'm
i'm just going to show you what we're looking at here okay so p 52 is our very earliest new testament
manuscript hooray it dates to sometime between 150 and 180 ce and this is the whole thing it's
two sided right and it contains texts from john chapter eight and that's it great wait so again
let's let's break us down when was john written it was 90 c 90 ish probably 90 90 you see so
so 60 70 80 years later 60 70 80 years after jesus had died it's written no no no no 60 70
80 years after john was written oh no no no i mean sorry i'm going back in first i'm saying
jesus dies then 60 years later is 90 ce yeah the original john is written and it's writing about
things that will happen six years ago in a different language a different location on earth yeah um
about things that happened 60 years ago and then the earliest copy we have is this credit card
size another parchment 60 70 years and this is all we have yeah this is it that's all of it so
and for people who are interested this is from john chapter 18 this is um uh jesus appearing before
pilot okay so that's p 52 and by the way this manuscript is that the university of manchester
hey that's that's where you got your phd yeah man that's right so okay so that's p 52 p 66 is
this say even bigger how big is that it's uh so what does this say here like if you if you
look at the oh um if we go back to this one you can see can you read great or isn't right
or you yeah i can read great yeah yeah so if you look here you can see the ruler here at the bottom
so those are centimeters and uh i guess if you're a philistine or an american you'll you'll
how many qubits is that inches i only measuring qubits so like that's that's about two centimeters
by five centimeters and that's uh john chapter 19 okay so there's p 66 but that's so actually i have
to say that's that's uh it all it belongs to this manuscript and this is an admittedly
very impressive manuscript so this is a codex from around the year 200
and it was once an entirely intact copy of the whole gospel of john that is without
to speak so hooray year 200 we've got the whole gospel whole gospel of john well um
presumably p p 60 um oh my gosh what was the first one with the p 20 p 52 presumably p 52 would be
from a whole copy of john presumably right or is it it's not how it worked is that a bad bad
assumption i think that is a an unfounded assumption okay yeah all right because i'm just imagining
yeah because nothing about it maybe there was certainly sections and yeah okay that makes sense
right because i have this but i have this perspective that's like they're writing the
eternal words of like i still have this christian perspective it's like these are the eternal words
of god that will live on forever like we're forgetting too that a lot of these um these
these these christians believe that g well because jesus said it that he was going to return in their
lifetimes they didn't think they were going to die of old age they did or they got killed or whatever
they they thought so there's no need to write me this down it was something until what three
70 or 360 or something where we actually canonize this like sometime in their third century or fourth
century sorry we canonized um the bible fourth century yeah yeah just like jeez he's uh taking
his time coming back what is it a day it's like a thousand years a thousand years like a day oh that
works out for us uh so it's been yeah so it's been two days um so you know lucky you know but it's
funny because jesus did actually say explicitly like he meant he's like he's like i can't be
in clear people standing here today will not taste death until they see the sun man coming on the clouds
and like he can't be any more clear but somehow he's being symbolic there or or or they won't
taste the second death as in like well you know who knows i mean that's um yes you know that's a huge
problem so anyway so this is p 77 p 77 now you'll notice uh these fragments these survive from
codices which are books so they have writing on the front and the back um you know i i work with
the dead sea scrolls which are scrolls and you only write on one side of the scroll
and you know when you have writing on two sides that's how you know it's a codex so um
but this is what you have this is p 77 and it preserves text from matthew 23
just matthew 23 uh so i thought you were gonna say matthew 23 at matthew 23 i actually thought
i was going to say more than that too so that's that's that's all we have all right so p 77 uh oh god
i shouldn't click that button sorry i have to do this over again so second century and it's easy
because you know this is all we have from the second century and we're just doing gospels
all right so that was p 77 here is p 90 it's a little bit bigger right a little bigger
and it comes from a codex so it's two sided uh it looks like um artwork from the early 2000s
it'd be on like a t-shirt if it was like oh i would i would wear that if it was on a t-shirt
yeah damn right so john 18 to 19 thereabouts that's what's text from we have preserved uh
or hang on on this particular manuscript hang on yeah yeah uh we actually have uh we have someone
who's actually solved it all for us um nitty oh good trust me brah yeah man trust me is legit
there we go so uh thanks nitty do we end the stream he's just probably
people are going god yes please end the stream
all right so uh so that's p p 90 next is p 103 so this is second or third century
so we're not even sure like this could be a third like like we date these things
based on the handwriting so you can imagine that there's a very you know there there's
there's a range right so it could be as late as like 220 230 so comes from a codex
math you yeah so okay so that was my question is like so we date these is a primarily
only with handwriting analysis or yeah or are there like other like do we do any carbon dating
with this stuff is that not accurate enough we we uh no the reason the reason manuscripts
aren't carbon dated is because um you have to you have to emulate the material so you know uh people
are are kind of antsy about uh destroying portions of their very very very valuable tiny
little bits of papyrus and parchment as you can imagine so um now i will say that there are
manuscripts that have been carbon dated and the carbon dating helps to um calibrate
or paleographical uh right so when you're when you're when you're dating the handwriting
if you use that calibration based on the carbon dating it's usually pretty accurate so
what we just want to go to get a degree you know also like get expertise in paleography like that
seems like uh oh there's places you can go it's very very niche so um i could be like a cave in
norway or something like it'll be like so niche that like you get trained by monks who only drink a
beer or something we could be the my my dirty little secret is that i don't have an actual degree
working in paleography i had to learn how to do it um from people who do it so i work with uh people
like uh michael legua and like uh daniel stucco benesra um and um who else uh mostly those two but uh
and lots of reading and lots of practice uh to learn how to do paleography and and i don't do
greek paleography i'm just depending on what's been provided here by uh the center for new testament
manuscripts all right this is the last one okay so matthew chapter 21 through all right i remember
for my own video i made i use this very much was that right and look at look at this look at the the
the verso side sorry the recto side no the verso side of this uh of this manuscript
and how much ink has survived there wow it's just very badly damaged so but now so now i have finished
congratulations everyone on this stream has now seen the entire extent of the manuscript evidence
for the gospels that dates to before the year 200 probably and that's it that is all of it
you will notice there is not a single fragment from the gospel of mark or the gospel of luke
um lots of john lots of matthew and very small fragments and that's it that's it
and i think i mean as uh i think this is a major problem um now i don't have reason to suspect
that the texts that we have were dramatically different from the time they were written to
the time of these manuscripts in the second century but importantly i don't know
we don't know right we just don't know
i have a question and i may have asked this before i've asked this definitely on stream
but i'm not sure if i've asked you but but i'll ask again maybe the whiskey will change your
answer if you have already answered it but um let's say let's say you know in a few years we
discover the perfect manuscript it comes from before any of the epistles are written and it's
it's it's a it's a new gospel we can date it perfectly it's preserved perfectly it's more
complete it has all the other gospels perfectly everything but in this gospel it has explicit
information about how the body was put into the tomb and then they decided to hide the body
right and they're like why the fuck would they write that down but let's say let's say they're
like hey look this is a secret we've got to hide the body this is where the body is located um and
we go to that location and it gives the reasons it has these reasons why they hid the body
of jesus we go to that location and we go and we and we dig it up and we find there's a body in
there and it says this is jesus christ of Nazareth and in this like it can be perfectly dated everything
is like legit is as legit as every like the holy grail of what apologetics would look after
how much how many apologists do you think would change their tune how many christians do you think
would change their tune and go oh jesus didn't rise from the dead do you like give me a percentage
or do you think that and and and i think and how your answer will will determine um
like it further emphasizes my point from the start that it's it's in a feeling then you
go looking for the evidence not the other way around i personally think not a lot of christians
would actually change their mind i think it wouldn't matter no i i agree with you i think that uh
there would be very there would be very few christians who actually changed their mind on the
basis of this i was going to say david that this sounds like a terrific plot point for a novel
the next national treasure national trip to three well but i i hate to break it to you um
that novel has already been written and it is called uh skeleton in god's closet uh written by
a christian apologist by the name of paul elmire uh so
wait what so yeah what this happens all the time i haven't read this this happens all the time where
i'll have a dream and i'll think it's real or i'll read a book and think it was my idea like
but this i haven't i'm sure i haven't read this book maybe someone told me this but like it's
somewhere there must be yeah but it's just such i think this just just goes to show what an
what a what a ubiquitous um idea this is right so uh but paul elmire like i said isn't a christian
he's a christian apologist and he wrote this novel um it's actually like like it's an okay it's
it's a pretty good read um and the story is about the discovery of a two uh with a body with bones
in it with an ossuary in it uh and the titillus uh for those who don't know the titillus is the uh
the the inscription that hung above uh jesus when he was christified here is jesus king of the jews
written in three languages that's like a strip club titillus it should it it's a strip club somewhere
right it's a wisdom if it's a porn site i haven't found it
oh god the whiskey the whiskey
god the mother ever my parents yeah i know i don't know but uh so the story
is like they found a tomb and there's the titillus in there i'm sorry i can't say it now
but and then there's there's like a written confession oh we're we're so bad us disciples we
we stole the body and uh and we we hit it again and uh and we started this rumor about uh jesus
rising from the dead and but it turns out good news in the novel it turns out that this is all
been an elaborate forgery from a very jaded atheist who's just mad at god right yeah there you go yeah
so it's like the um there was that there was that fake there was that fake fossil um in paleontology uh
or oh yeah like pilled out man and yeah pilled out man yeah but i yeah so there's something
i wanted to share with you i said that i said um that i wasn't sure if i should share this but i
i um i thought it was i told you that i was going to share it when i was talking to you
about doing this stream but last time we're on i showed my family our stream together and i said
the funniest thing about the stream was just the difference in the start to the end so we were
drinking rye and for two hours and 47 minutes um and i just want to show everyone so this is the
start and uh i'll play the audio you can hear us i specialize in quiet texts we can't put together
we look you know we look all right all right now let's just skip to the end and you just hear our
words a little a little bit more elongated the edited they're not particularly reliable and
usually my face is a little like in that comment are we both during our speech i think we're both
so you know i think that's what's happening uh that's what's happening here as well no man
i am i am stone cold sober right now i thought you were gonna say you're stoned um no that's uh
neil the 604 atheist is probably stoned right now he does like yeah like uh a smoke i've
ever heard miffusion asks us keep ever checked out the first century novel by chariton and oh
in book three chapter three about the empty tomb no this is a first century novel about the empty
tomb i don't know right but that's that's worth every year every year we do the every year we do
the um the derrick knows everything christmas special where because there are so many holy
interviews i bring him on oh god i just get him to tell me what he's learned throughout the year so
we get the whole of miffusion in one year and uh last christmas it's gonna be if there is if there
is a first century novel about the empty tomb i have to know about it uh but yeah i i if i i
think i suspect he's probably got something wrong either in the date or in the content because that
would be something uh so but the point can we get to the novel about yeah sorry get to the point
no no no all right so the point is that we don't have good attribution for the gospels
that date back before like the very late second century and what this means is that we have no
assurance that these are the reports of eyewitnesses and i think this just this just this just
compounds the point i made earlier that these were texts that were all written in greek
they weren't written by people who witnessed the life and death of jesus they're not
they just are not
so there's um
no i could continue no i was gonna say like i mean so we'll go through the book but honestly
strobel leans into this so hard through the entire rest of the book his entire line of questioning
just presumes that the gospels are eyewitness accounts and that they're
in effect historiography and maybe this is a good way to kind of segue into the the second problem
with uh the the whole uh first chapter by blomberg where blomberg is blomberg's whole
point is to establish uh that these were gospel authorship is important because it's only through
you know the the attribution of matthew mark luke and john that you can trace these back
neither to eyewitnesses matthew and john or to associates of eyewitnesses supposedly mark
was the translator of peter right and luke the physician companion of paul who was also not an
eyewitness uh but but this is how can i can i just interject quickly um so we're talking about
like who wrote the gospels are they eyewitnesses you're saying probably not um no they're anonymous
they're anonymous they're anonymous yeah but were they you know based of eyewitness and they were
written in greek probably not yeah so yeah but i and feel free not to answer this because this is a bit
of a um a bit of a topic going on at the moment but what do you how do you feel about uh in a few
day uh not a few days um so uh we're actually yeah in like you know a couple weeks you mentioned
your we're drinking beautiful nicker um and it's like um eating an ochre barrel um might the guest
that i'm about to mentioned um chose the froig which i've heard be described as like kissing a
cigar smoking walrus um and i would say that's that's pretty accurate i love it it's denis mcdonald
so oh yeah so i want to ask you see this is perfect this is a perfect segue
well this is what i do well my what do you think about my mesis what do you think about the idea
that the gospel writers were trying to retell parts of the greek although trying to tell the
story of jesus based on like ideas but spinning it with greek narratives um because they were taught
great so um so this is the second point that uh blomberg wants to make right or that strobel
wants to make in his discussion uh and i will just i'll just uh am i on page yeah i'm on page
27 so uh here uh blomberg says uh with regards to to whether or not the gospels have a theological
agenda so the presumption is made at the outset and i think this is a huge huge huge mistake
made by christian apologists without any good reason and without any
evidential basis is to assume that these four gospels matthew mark lukin john
are just historical retellings of the life of jesus that their biographies they've been described
by a number of scholars as greco roman biographies or bios is the is the technical term and i i think
that's that's perhaps the the best way to classify them relative to you know the the the large
fascinating world of greek literature but i just don't think there's problems like the gospels are
kind of an oddity they're sort of a unique type of greek literature and one of the reasons for
this is i believe because they're based on um uh either jewish sayings or maybe even earlier
jewish texts so they're greek they're part of greco- roman literature but by the same token
they're they're they're an unusual category of literature and importantly they're not histories
they're not biographies they're theology the primary purpose of the gospels is to communicate
theology it's to communicate ideas about what christianity is so i was just in one of the sections
in this first chapter uh where where uh strobel interviews blomberg he asked the question of the
gospels theological agenda uh and this is how blomberg answers it he says that matthew mark
and luke each had very distinctive theological angles that they want to highlight luke the
theologian of the poor and social concern matthew the theologian trying to understand
the relationship of christianity to judaism mark who shows jesus as the suffering servant
you can make a long list of the distinctive theologies in matthew mark and luke so
denis mcdonald i think has rather clearly demonstrated that there is a foundation within
all four of the gospels
in greek myths that these are uh riffing on old greek myths in the retelling of the life of jesus
and i think he's right about that and i think this reinforces the point which is very important
this is greek literature written by greeks to greeks now the reason that's important is because
the movement that jesus spawned in his life and after his death was a jewish movement
it was a sect of judaism and it's something about which we know almost nothing because nothing has
survived from that period very quickly this movement of jesus from the time of his death
emerged within judaism and we know a little bit about its existence thanks to paul
who is writing in like the fifties c e so like 20 years after jesus so we know about it
but we don't know anything directly from it and the reason is because in 67
the jews en masse revolted against rome and entered into a war with rome that lasted for
three years before the the roman general vespasian finally crushed the jewish revolt in 70 c e and
he entered the city of jerusalem and he completely destroyed the temple and carried away all the
treasures from the temple in the city um most scholars as far as i know will agree
that this early movement of jesus this jewish movement of jesus which was centered in jerusalem
died when the city of jerusalem was sacked and the temple was destroyed
and what emerged after that was this international movement that paul the apostle had started to
found in these greek speaking centers in corinth and Ephesus and rome and in galatia
these were greek speaking jewish communities that uh he used to forge this early version of
christianity but this is all that survived of that and it's a it is a greek speaking
movement which is why all the literature was written in greek
so do you think it have you seen the um stuff with like um
the like the sailing to uh an island in the greek uh yeah what do you think about that
like that seems like really oh i i mean i think so i did um uh
my i i didn't really know anything about denis mcdonald until uh derrick a couple of years ago
asked me actually to to work on a couple of videos that he did with denis and he asked me
because i know a little bit of i know a little bit of greek so he wanted me to be able to to
kind of work through stuff that denis was saying and make nice visuals for it so this was kind of
my first exposure to denis's work and i was particularly convinced by the way that that he
he navigated uh the gospel retellings of the crucifixion and how they compare uh to the death
of hector in particular i thought was was pretty remarkably convincing and in the bits that i've
read of his work i've got his book now um but in the bits that i've read from other portions of the
gospels i tend to think yeah he's totally on point here this is greek literature significantly
the way people in the first and second century learned how to read greek was by reading homer
that's how you learn how to read greek and that's why so much of homer shows up in all
sorts of greek literature including the gospels now um i think i think importantly though and this
is something like i i love denis mcdonald and i think he's totally on point but it is also
significant to note that as much as these are greek texts they are also um employing old ideas
from early judyism within these texts as well so i would say and and this is this is the the huge
huge problem with what strobel and blondberg are doing where they take for granted that these are
just straightforward historical retellings of the life of jesus no that's not what these are
these are theological texts that are riffing on the old testament and then through the lens
of the greek classics in a way to make theological points about christianity
yeah that that makes sense to me you know and and at that point you can't even talk
about eyewitness testimony you can't even talk about the historical jesus really on the basis
of what's in the gospel just because there is no interest in these texts in history
none like there's just none it's all about promoting ideas of who jesus was in an effort
to emphasize what the the writers thought was important for their individual communities
so um do you have a bible handy i do ask your question and then good hold it hold on to
keep it handy for a minute but yeah the bible i used in ministry college beautiful this is actually
a painting by my sister in law of me and uh my wife and your dog my wife and yeah very um what's
the dog's name uh well he's a lot he was our last dog but his name was butters yeah he passed
yeah we do his name is mani and he's a beagle he looks very similar um but we didn't give him
that name he was um his real name was highway man but they called him mani for short so i don't know
we rescued him um kind of um but what i was gonna what i was gonna say so this is this is my non
biblical scholar mind like thinking about what maybe could have happened i love psychoanalyzing
people times things i don't have any qualifications to do so i just enjoy it so uh when derrick and
neil came on um the show we talked about this very thing and and these are the differences between
you know um Odysseus nine and you know um and ten and mark and it's it's crazy right like there's a
lot of like it's incredible um it's incredible oh my gosh so this is a video gosh there's a video
here i did called christianlies lost diversity you can check it out on the channel it's really
really incredible what i would think possibly happened here this is my this is what i what i
think could have happened and this has no merit but this is what i can see maybe happening is that
jesus was like some sort of a teacher rabbi like you know some sort of uh apocalyptic preacher of
the time and he went and had an interaction where he he set a insane man on the straight and narrow
he uh he stopped him from being catastrophically naked and bashing himself rocks that story turned
into you know um turned into the story of jesus casting out the demon and you know and there's
and there's some some mention of some pigs and stuff and then the person retells it tells it
in this story of like well you know this is the greek gods this is what the greek myths talk about
well i'm going to retell it in the style of that same narrative but i'm going to add parts into
the history so you've got like this very natural situation turning into a spiritual thing through
the course of like 40 years um you know for things to mythologize and uh and everything
like that um oh and just quickly um i i have a i have a special guest who's just going to pop in
if that's okay just two two seconds is that right does he get a does he get a trouble intro
so this is let's let's keep let's take this as a quick intermission uh derrick has been blowing
up my um i'm too drunk to to work to to do this for you derrick so i was like just come on
he's just gonna spend five minutes drunker than i am to talk about this um this empty tomb that you
were talking about um okay dude so oh god what the hell is this okay i'm not here to trick you i
am dead serious but here's the problem i'm on my phone so i can't see that's so fine a print
he was so he was actually in the bath when he sent me a photo of himself i'm literally
gave a dick pic i sent him a little itty bitty peter pic and and he you gotta pay me for that
david you gotta pay me for that um so what does this say here says can you read that okay surely
someone asked for examples of the ancient literature that contain well let me just give
you a summary real quick then i think it's worth reading so this is on riddhar okay which he's
pretty cool i really enjoy reading his stuff um because he's pretty skeptical he tries not to draw
conclusions but he's like really on the critical side chariton is an author a roman author like
he's writing a roman novel in the first century ad this is not about jesus however in this novel
book three chapter three i think it is and we'll read the section there's a part where the characters
in the novel named charius and color ho or caliharo however you pronounce it that's the woman
that he's in love charius is in love with her she gets like captured or something happens in the
novel where she has a tomb and they think she's dead and they bury her in the tomb charius is like
i don't want to live anymore we're going to read that go ahead and zoom in let's let's read this
this is super powerful i think kip's going to be blown away when he sees this someone asked for
examples of the ancient literature that contain motifs echoed in the biblical narratives i'll
post a few beginnings beginning charitons novella charius and caliharo i do not believe that we have
a any reason to think that there's any genetic relationship between the following extract and
the gospels the similarities arise entirely from a shared cultural and thought world it appears to me
that the event evangelists were drawing upon stock literary tropes when they related their
respective empty tomb scenarios a mourner comes very early in the morning to the tomb where his
beloved was placed the evening before he finds it open he is fearful and confused others come see
but none dare to go inside when the body is found to be missing the first thought of the mourner is
that he had she has been taken up to heaven as a living goddess as per otherwise unknown variants
of the myth myths of ariadne and simile who were made divine after apparently dying i have highlighted
the passages that remind us of the gospel empty tomb narratives one of the more interesting details
i think is that the first to arrive at the tomb do not enter this is i think in one of the gospels
um where's it at i'm sitting here trying to do not enter until someone else arrives later and
does so compare the gospel of john sequence of peter and the beloved disciple as for the data
charitans work bp reardon whose translation i'm copying thinks it belongs to the mid first century
ce now let's go to the blue charitans employer may possibly have been okay you went really far down
um all right no you know what let's just read let's just read the narrative because look he argues
okay the tomb robber robbers had been careless in closing the tomb it was at night they were in
a hurry at the krakadon chariots turned up at the tomb ostensibly now notice this is not the only
novel or story where at the krakadon people appear at this tomb or at a tomb in jesus's gospel same
thing at the krakadon chariots turned up at the tomb ostensibly to offer wreaths and libations
but in fact in fact with the intention of doing away with himself he didn't want to live anymore
he could not bear being separated from color caliro i pronounce it caliro and i looked it up
online there's several ways to pronounce it and thought that the death was the only thing that
would cure his grief when he reached the tomb he found that the stones the stones had been moved
and the entrance was open he was astonished at the site and overcome by fearful perplexity
at what had hold on one second at what had happened rumor a swift messenger told the syracusians
this amazing news they all did i say that right uh anyway they all try to keep going they all
quickly crowded around the tomb but no one dared go inside until hermocrates gave an order to do
so the man who was sent in reported the whole situation accurately it seemed incredible that
even the corpse was not lying there then chariots himself determined to go in in his desire to
see caliro again even dead but though he hunted through the tomb he could find nothing many people
could not believe it and went in after him they were all seized by helplessness one of them standing
there said the funeral offerings have been carried off it is tomb robbers who have done that but what
about the corpse where is it many different suggestions circulated in the crowd chariots
look toward the heavens notice something real quick this is what the scholars like richard c
miller and others are saying at that time when the person who was a noble person their bodies
went missing after death it was assumed they were they were a divine being if it was a woman it was
a goddess if it was a male he was a god and this is why in the greco-roman world the gospels greek
literature even though it's highly emphasizing jewish materials it is living hellenistically so
chariots look toward the heavens remember now the body's missing and they're all trying to
figure out what happened chariots already assumes divine look toward the heavens stretched up his
arms and cried which of the gods is it then who has become my rival in love and carried off caliro
and is now keeping her with him against her will constrained by a more powerful destiny that is why
she died suddenly so that she would not realize what was happening that is how Dionysus took
Ariadne and theses or from theses how Zeus took simile it looks as if i had a goddess for a wife
without knowing it someone above my station but she should not have left the world so quickly
even for such a reason thetis was a goddess but she stayed with police and he had a son by her
i have been abandoned at the very height of my love what is to happen to me what is to become
of me poor wretch should i do away with myself and who would share my grave i did have this much to
look forward to in my misfortune that if i could not continue to share caliro's bed i should come
to share her grave my lady i offer my justification for living you force me to live because i shall
look for you on land and sea and in the very sky if i can reach there this i beg of you my dear
do not flee from me at this the crowd broke out in lamentation everyone began to lament for killer
caliro as though she had just died now in the novel you find out she's not actually dead
she doesn't resurrect she's actually alive and was taken captive and literally like by pirates
there's a whole it's a novel dude and it's it's fiction it's fiction it's great fiction so
i wanted to throw that at you just to get your thoughts because you're having so much fun
diving into this i thought that you were trolling at one stage like i thought like i kind of left
it and i thought you were talking about a first century novel about the empty tomb of jesus i knew
i i kind of click baited you with that that uh yeah i'm pissed
look i love you kid no i mean so i mean what darin points out though is important for people
to recognize that this the missing body um is an important well-worn trope within like great
literature and you know the the resurrection of jesus the well greek roman yeah you could
hellenize literature so and especially mark like how does mark end the women come to the tomb
the stone is already rolled away the body is missing and there's a young man there who says
you know he's risen from the dead he'll meet you in gallilee and then it says that they they
went away and they were afraid and they told no one but this this ending and i think this is part of
why scholars tend to think mark is much earlier than matthew luke right john you know one one
of because this fits within this uh this this this greco roman missing body trope right exactly
all of this thanks for thanks for showing up darik um yeah but i mean it just it just underscores
the the broader point here that these are not history no this is literature it's literature
that doesn't mean there can't be as you pointed out when you did the recordings just the other day
well the day before yesterday with josh and me or was the day before that either way um
just the whole notion of you know you have very similitude there is realisms but
like that does not mean these are histories so um it's really really interesting the whole
thing is really interesting to me because i tend to think the empty tomb is is complete legend
narrative i do too but i have really played with the idea if it isn't that there's a couple
different options that i kind of play with and one of them could be the disciples really did
steal the body not only because you know go ahead i was just so people should know i spent a couple
days at darik's house um last week with uh with dr josh bowen and uh and this is something we we
talked about uh well we were there and and darik suggested this you know i think there's there's
some you know we need to give stronger consideration to the possibility that the
disciples stole the body and i thought about that and i'm like well you know when you look at how
it's reported in mark think about this it's an empty tomb there's like a kid inside the tomb
when the women come come to the tomb and the kid's like he's gone go back to galilee yeah like
like this could be this could be a a a straightforward report of something that happened
and not have been a miracle right right right i just like it's i just want to say quickly um
darik congratulations on getting to 100,000 subscribers. Yeah man that's awesome man you got
a plaque another thing is i wanted to share this image um i love that this image because um
because kip you look like a pirate a metalhead pirate and um and dr josh looks like bill nye the
science guy with that bow tie i just love it's it's like it's so good is this the best like i'm
looking forward to seeing darik looks shocked that both of us are in his basement i know so good
but you know i can't wait to see those courses that you're doing and this is probably actually
a really good time uh to mention um i've just become a um a affiliate uh for yes for mid-fishing
courses and you have a course uh dr kip davis on here the real ancient israelite religion so if
you sign up the link down below and you do this course um we'll you deep drinks will get kickbacks
and you'll be helping kip you'll be helping darik you'll be helping myself um keep these
kind of shows running so if you do like um what what uh professor kip davis has to say um you've
got you know this is uh you can um check out this course can you tell us a little bit about this kip
as we um yeah absolutely so this is uh the course is real israelite religion's facts on the ground
and propaganda in the bible in which i explore uh the the the way religion is depicted in the
biblical text and extrapolate that and compare it to what we know from the archaeological record
in what i think is a really interesting and compelling historical investigation
of the people and the um the powers that uh promoted uh the various types of israelite religion
so it's a history course it's a religion's course and it's a bible course and i i think it's pretty
damn great and if you buy it then david can go and buy more bottles of nikah because honestly it's
god damn expensive so i will actually i will actually say you know thank you everyone for the
superchats because like with all the drinks that the guests are asking for we're running in the
red big time like denison mcdonald's $150 bottle uh $120 bottle kip $100 bottle uh that uh captain
dadpool like $80 bottle like this there's just you know his beer isn't it it's expensive he's
wanting um he's wanting uh a special uh rum um let me let me just plug this thing about kip's course
because i edited that that course and it was tough getting through because i was there for most of
the recording well let me say why it was tough to get through it wasn't it was tough to get through
because i was already there to hear you record a lot of it to begin with then i had to go and edit
it and let me just explain to people about this course specifically yours i love all the courses
we do some i like a little more than others yours is not only amazing but it's 18 lectures
and we calculated it like 14 hours of material at 4k so it's like it's like most of my courses are
like four hours long this is why i've been helping direct edit because like he's got he's so busy
oh my gosh mine is mine is also the only course with heavy metal in it that's true
that's it's heavy metal and yours is got like clips from like amazing shows and stuff that
have found their way in so game of thrones life of pie walking dead all sorts of good
yeah well um derrick thanks for popping in um thank you i appreciate you getting in well

we're while we're while we keep before we jump back into it you've got a youtube channel as well
that is fantastic um and you've got a um a patreon people can sign up to if they want to help
support your work and of course people can find you on twitter um the the funnest thing to do with
kip is just to tag him into tag him in um debates he loves to just come in love you roasted someone so
bad someone was what did you say it was it was amazing um was that uh was that uh someone was
someone was challenging me on about slavery and then you came in and i see what the problem is here
you can't read you can't read yeah so uh yeah all the links are in the description of course and
yeah check out the your stuff let's let's jump back into it back into mischievous so okay so
speaking i i wanted to i wanted to talk a little bit and you've got your bible handy um just to
give people an idea because one of the things that that greg void and lee straw will lean into
hard is this idea that the gospels are like these straightforward retellings of history
kind of like um you know uh inner newspaper interviews with with eyewitnesses to a car crash
i i seriously think that they would they would offer that as an analogous description as to
what's going on in the gospels and the point being that oh yeah there's there's dramatic
differences between the gospels but this is okay because these are just different perspectives
from individual eyewitnesses of the same things that are going on and that is just the totally
wrong way to read these texts so um just by way of example like i've suggested already that these
are theological texts they're not history these are very intentional retellings of the life of
jesus maybe even inventions of numerous aspects of the life of jesus but in order to fulfill
a theological model an idea of of what you know at this point what the correct observance of
Judaism should be or what early christianity ought to be so in this sense you tend to get these
varying pictures of jesus because he fulfills these various ideals i like to contrast in
particular the way so the way this works the first gospel written was math uh was mark uh we've
already said written maybe sometime around 60 as early as 60 could be later um but could be as
early as 60 uh this is the very first retell this is the first constructed narrative of the life
of jesus which incorporates various teachings of jesus into a theological picture of who he is
and what christianity ought to be so both matthew and luke just took mark and rewrote it and when
i say that what i mean is they took the gospel of mark and they literally took like cited large
sections verbatim like they just copied it directly and then when they encountered
something that they didn't like or something that contrasted with their own theological ideas
they made changes but we'll talk a little bit about that in you know when if we ever get to get
to the second chapter but like this happens both matthew and luke are making direct changes to the
gospel of mark which fit their own theological agendas but importantly and you brought this up
with uh with denise mcdonald the the critical thing to realize is that all the gospels are
theological literature and they're grounded in these older stories on the greco- roman side
there's numerous parallels with uh the stories in holmard in the iliad in the odyssey you can see
denise mcdonald has has catalogued dozens and dozens of literary parallels with what with what's
going on there and that makes sense right because when you learn how to read greek you use homer
so this is already ingrained into the writer's thinking but there's more to it you also have
stories from the old testament in the gospel of matthew matthew is trying to portray jesus
as a new moses you know if you think about his birth narrative he
you have a reflection of the slaughter of the innocence which only occurs in matthew but reflects
the story in exodus chapter one about how babies under the age of two were all slaughtered by the
pharaoh in egypt jesus actually only in the gospel of matthew has to go to egypt uh to escape
you know hered's persecution and then he comes out of egypt just like moses jesus delivers
his version of the law in the sermon of the mount just like moses there's all these parallels that
matthew is intentionally trying to make with the life and teachings of moses and you can track this
all the way through his retelling of of the life of jesus but this is totally different from what
luke is trying to do luke is attempting to provide a more international flavor to his gospel and in
so doing sets his focus on the lives of the northern prophets elysia and elysia from the
old testament specifically from first king 17 to second king's chapter 13 and the excellent
new testament scholar who's now deceased thomas brody spent his entire career
tracking the relationship of the gospel of luke in particular to these stories that take place
in uh first and second kings featuring elysia and elysia so just to give you a taste of how this
works um thomas brody tracked uh the following from chapter first king's chapter 16 through
17 and compared that to luke chapter one through seven in particular chapter seven so
um for example in first king's chapter 17 you have a story of elysia
saving uh a woman who's been you know doomed to die and then in luke chapter seven you have a
story of jesus saving the centurion slave uh in verse 17 to 24 elysia raises the son of the widow
from death in luke chapter seven verse one to 17 jesus raises the son of a widow from death
then in there's this kind of an interlude in chapter 22 which features the prophet makaya
in luke chapter seven it features the prophet john then in second king's chapter four versus one
to 37 there's a story of an indebted woman in luke chapter seven versus 36 to 50 there's the story
of an indebted woman in first king's chapter 18 versus 20 to 38 you have a story of all of israel
which makes mention of 12 stones in chapter in luke chapter eight versus one to three there's
mentioned there's there's uh the ministry of jesus to various towns and cities there's mention of
women and the 12 so what basically what uh and and i wanted to to go into one of these stories
in a little bit more detail but basically what thomas brody is pointing out is that whoever
wrote the gospel of luke had this uh this story of elysia and elysia open in front of him from the
old testament and he's basically writing the story of jesus to align with the story of elysia
in an effort to present jesus as like a new elysia a new great prophet from the nation of israel
so and he tracks this all the way through luke and through ads it's pretty remarkable so but
i think we should see i i want to i want to illustrate in closer detail how this works so
you got your bible handy right david i want you to open to luke chapter one is that the new testament
or the old testament that's in that's in i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding so and we're
gonna we're gonna compare this luke chapter one here's chapter one verse five so in chapter one
luke begins his gospel with this large preamble where he talks about um the fact that he's drawing
from eyewitness testimony and how reliable his account is and how important it is to write this
down because previous accounts of the life of jesus have been wanting in some way shape or form
so this is like a revision of what's come to us previously and when you write a revision
it's because there's problems with the earlier version i think that's important right yeah
so he starts with that and then in verse five he begins his story now if you could just read
like the first sentence in verse five in the time of herod king of judia there was a priest named
zachariah who belonged to the priestly division of abadja abadja abadja yeah abadja yeah all right
good thank you so um now brody suggests that what luke is drawing from is in parallel it's a direct
parallel with the story in first kings chapter 16 and the very beginning of of chapter 17 so
first kings chapter 16 verse 29 says in the second year of yosaphat a chav son of omri began to reign
he reigned over israel in samaria uh 22 years now a couple things i think that are important to point
out uh first of all yosaphat is the king of juda in the introduction that you read david
it mentions herod who is the king of juda right judia yeah yeah judia exactly so it introduces
ekab who is the son of omri who rules in samaria you'll notice in chapter one verse five he talks
about a priest by the name of zachariah who is of the priestly lineage of who you said abadja
abadja yeah so in greek it's abiyah now in greek the name omri is omri
and the difference between them is a single letter so when you look at them in greek
they're very very similar to one another so you've got a king you've got reference to a king of juda
in herod in luke chapter one verse five in first kings chapter 16 verse 29 it references it provides
as a as a time marker the rule of yosaphat who was ruling in juda and then you have this
this very similar name okay continue by reading verses five the rest of verse five and then all of
verse six uh his wife elizabeth was also a descendant of aaron both of them were upright
in the sight of god observing all of the lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly good
okay so there's a couple things going on here i'm going to read from verses 30 to 31 which
follows in chapter 16 of first kings now ahab did what was evil before the lord
he was more wicked than all who were before him and it was not enough for him to go in his sins
of yereboam salam nabaat and he took a wife yesabel daughter of king yethabaal of the sedonians
and went and was subject to baal and did obeisance to him now couple things to note first of all
in in the story that you read it mentions that zakariah has a wife right at the start
and her name is what elizabeth elizabeth in greek it's elizabeth now this is kind of it's it's
kind of flipped in in in the version so at the end of the story i read it says that ahab took
a wife and her name is yesabel it's very similar and when you see them written down next to each
other they look very very close to one another says that she's the daughter of yethabaal king
of the sedonians now what it says when what luke says about both um zakariah and elizabeth is that
they were righteous and that they walked this is important it says that they walked in the ways
of yahweh right in the ways of the lord look at what it says about ahab and his wife jesabel it says
ahab did what was evil before the lord he was more wicked than all who was before him
and it literally says uh when it says that that that he was subject to uh the baal and
did obeisance to him it uses that same word he walked in the ways the the wicked ways of his
ancestors so it looks like at the outset that there is an intentional reversal by luke of what
the author of first kings is doing here so but is is so you mentioned that they're the
spells the same just quickly wasn't similar in in in he in hebrou and this was in greek so
i would suggest that what the the author of uh luke is doing is reading from the greek translation
of the hebrou okay which is fairly different right yeah so and i'm what i'm doing here is
actually reading from the greek translation so it'll be a little bit different from the hebrou text
so and this is this is part of how we know what he's doing because it matches so closely
to the greek translation of the hebrou um even though again this is a translation of an earlier
text right so go ahead and read verses eight through to eleven okay once then zechariah's
division was on duty and he was serving as uh priest before god he was chosen by lot according
to the customer of the priesthood to go into the temple of the lord to burn incense and then when
the time for the burning of incense came all the assembled worshipers were praying outside
include verse 11 or not yeah include verse 11 then an angel of the lord appeared to him standing
at the right side of the altar of incense good okay so here's what the text of first kings chapter
16 verses 31 to 32 says um sorry uh yeah okay so he said oh um he went and was subject to baal
and he worshiped him and he set up an altar for baal in the house of his wickedness or his offenses
which he built in samaria and akhav made a grove and akhav added to do provocations to provoke
the anger so that his life might be destroyed he did more evil than all the kings of israel
who were before him so what's going on here you'll notice a couple of things i think the dimension
at the end of in verse 11 where it says that uh an angel of the lord appeared where
did you catch it he appeared on the altar of incense
in the uh it's a standing right side of the standing on the right side of the altar and
it's unfortunate if you know break you can see this uh when it says that akhav erects an altar
to baal it's the same words it's the the setting up for this standing of an altar to baal so
i know right so this is incredible so
okay so so yeah the writer of luke is reading this text and he's just kind of rewriting it
but featuring jesus and as we'll come to discover john the baptist right like this is
this is a foundational text for him he's riffing on it he's using it to construct his own narrative
and i'm making this point as as an important feature to illustrate how this we can't read
this stuff as history it's literature it's the artistic development of earlier texts into a new
story um but there's more so uh read verse 13 through i think that's verse 16
okay but the angel said to him but the angel said to him do not be afraid zachariah your prayers
have been heard your wife elizabeth will bear your son your son uh and you will give him the name
john the name john he uh he will be a joy and delight to you and many will rejoice because of
his birth for he will be great in the sight of the lord he will never uh he is never to take
wine or other fermented drink and he will be filled with with the holy spirit even from birth
many of the people of israel will will bring back to the lord they uh he will bring back to the
lord they god and he will go on uh before the lord uh and he will go on before the lord uh in spirit
in the spirit yes of elijah yes turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient
to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready the people prepare the way for the lord there you go so
he ends it's very important that how he ends that that uh that verse right he talks about how
john's going to be a new elijah and then what does he say he says he's going to turn the hearts
of the people back to god right so all right here's what what what it says in first kings
chapter 16 verses 34 it says now it makes this an odd sort of term um and it's contrasting it it's
it's using this as a comparison of how bad a have was says in his days achial uh of bethel
built jericho or rebuilt jericho and he laid its foundations with avrion his firstborn and set up
his doors with his younger son sego of according to the word of yahweh which he spoke by the hand
of the asos son of now now you're probably wondering at the outside well what the hell does that have
to do with anything um i would suggest in the first place this is a narration this is a very
polite narration of child sacrifice when it says that he laid its foundation with his firstborn it
basically means that he sacrificed his firstborn in an effort to provide him enough power and
influence in order to complete the task at hand now you'll notice this is an account of wicked
fathers sacrificing their sons for wicked purposes whereas at the end of the passage that i asked you
to to cite regarding elijah what is it saying about him it says it will turn the hearts of sons
back to their fathers and of fathers back to their sons so again it's like a reversal of this terrible
story which takes place in first king's chapter 16 and then at the beginning of chapter 17 it
introduces none other than elijah the prophet the tishbite from teshbon of galad and he said to
ega ahav the lord lives the god of hosts the god of israel before whom i stand if there shall be due
and rain these years except by the word of my mouth so i i bring up this particular text as a way to
illustrate what the author of luke is doing he's riffing off of these old stories about elijah
and then elijah that appear in first and second kings and he's using them in his construction
of the story of jesus and you can see it clearly it's it's particularly obvious when you're reading
the greek text but i think even if you're comparing with the english with with a careful eye you can
see oh yeah so he's deliberately constructing this stuff to emulate something that's earlier
so all that to say when when strobel and um what's his name craig blomberg go to great lengths
to demonstrate that the gospels provide eyewitness testimony to the life of jesus
this is nonsense the gospels are literature they're greek literature they're anonymous greek
literature that was written very late compared to the life of jesus and they literally had nothing
to do with the actual life of jesus and were much more interested in in uh providing uh
force to their own theological points and their own emphasis
hmm wow so the i can't believe we're at three hours and i know right and we're only on point
one um that's amazing we'll have to do more of these let us know do you guys like this kind of
stuff as we're we're we're diving deeper into scholarship and we're talking about the apologetics
let us know um if you like it like you got 50 viewers right now yeah i i know um so thank you so
much thank you everyone who's um you know like and share and favorite and send this to your
fundamentalist brother-in-law but just um you know um deep drinks community is like the best
community i love i love you guys so much but something i wanted to mention about the only
thing i had to mention about the eyewitness testimony this was a problem in um in what i
call logic so well when i say when i call logic jeez this this alcohol is affecting me um so
something that i found really interesting good so i found really interesting is they'll use
eyewitness testimony and be like the gospels were eyewitness accounts this is what they'll say
or they'll written bottom eyewitness accounts and so therefore trustworthy right the problem with that
is we have like eyewitness accounts of not to get political but january 6th uh and people
strongly disagree about what happened there and we've got cameras and videos and reporting and
like and people are you know we've got a highly emotional subject policy politics yeah um and
people have just made up narratives out of it has nothing to do with reality they're looking for
things that that aren't there and they find them um on i want to take a side here i'm just
even newer january 6th happened in 2021 oh isn't that's what i said yeah narratives that have
you know been been forwarded out of that something that happened two years ago
yeah it's crazy and there's there's camera angles and there's like yeah this is um and
and there's there's different narratives right and these are from eyewitnesses so but something that
you know so i don't think eyewitness testimony is like all is cracked up to be i'm not an expert but
however something that i thought was really brilliant when when barna ermin was talking
to an apologist he mentioned the book of mormon because the book of mormon you know joseph
smith the story is goes joseph smith was uh had an angel appeared to him in 18 in biblical times
1826 whatever it was 18 something 18th century take your way back to biblical times in the promise
land of new york state yeah yeah in uptown new york so um so you know and he dug up these
god he said i've i've written a third gospel you know um everyone loves a trilogy so go
dig it up it's in you know somewhere around your backyard you dug up these golden plates you could
it had some form of um ancient egyptian on there that you could read with these special
glasses like sphere stones and you could and he rewrote the uh this this third gospel um the
book of nephi and then and elie i think that's anyway drunk and i'm not i don't i don't have
larmic story i think it won't have been anyway but but these yeah yeah but these these golden plates
were like these were the things that he found and they're not only were there eight witnesses
who testified to seeing touching holding playing with these golden plates um they when they left the
church they still said yep i've left the church but the golden plates are real like 100 not only
were there eight witnesses there were three witnesses including not including joseph smith so
four in total that said they saw an angel hand the golden plates or just hand the golden plates
of the angel and i think one or two of them left the church and and still said that they
they still agree with what they saw this that i think like it's like i know people people left
the church but nobody actually recanted from what they claimed they saw yeah so like we saw the angel
we saw the golden plates and but there's the christians the tiktok christians and these
apologists they won't accept the golden plates no way do they accept the golden plates or more
of the claims of modernism so for me it's a double standard for me it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa you're talking about 40 years after the fact written by non-eye witnesses and like written by
anonymous sources in a different language you're telling me that that's more uh more accurate than
like what the narratives of january 6 or the um you know or the uh you know book of
Mormon like that that to me that seems disingenuous um so to me the eye the whole eyewitness thing
even let's say they are eyewitnesses it falls apart it still doesn't work it still is not like
an open and a shut case it's still not like therefore like even let's let's grant it let's
grant their eyewitness testimony let's say all four gospels were written by the four disciples
like it adds a bit of weight to it but it's still i still don't think it's even if you even if you
get that far it's not like a slam dunk you think it is it's not the flex you think it is no it
absolutely is not so um maybe the because because we're probably gonna we're we're probably going
to have to wrap this up and pick this up at another time yes but maybe let's um maybe so we finish
we finished the chapter yay i i think the other ones would go go quicker um but i think it's
important too one of the uh i'll stress this again when it comes to lee strobel's book
so much of what uh grounds his discussion and his investigation all is totally dependent on these
two ideas that the gospels provide eyewitness testimony of the life of jesus and that the
gospels are reliable because the authors were either eyewitnesses or closely acquainted with
eyewitnesses and critical scholarship says no on both accounts yeah i mean i think we've done
enough here tonight to completely deflate this balloon this is literature it's mythic
and it's anonymous it's serving a completely different purpose than biography or historiography
and i can say that when i'm drunk and it would be even more forceful if i was sober follow
kip on twitter and you'll see him if he renegs uh the um tomorrow morning when he's hungover
um yeah there we go hey man i just have uh super chats yeah i was just gonna say let's go through
some super chats um we have a few and you know i really appreciate um super chats coming through
the nitty said the gd manuscripts when i saw the real chart of completions i was furious getting
fleeced by the apopigists um those are supposed to be apologists i think aren't they yeah apopigists
yeah it's um it bothers me so much like that they just get away with with murder you know well you
hear um i so if if people are interested i did a uh i did a documentary i think it's still maybe the
best thing i've ever done on youtube i did a documentary about uh josh mcdowell on my channel
and he leans hard most apolitists lean hard into the sheer numbers there's a lot of new
testament manuscripts but what they fail to do at every turn is to talk honestly about the date
and the contents of those manuscripts something else i should also point out um i haven't done
the legwork on this but there's uh uh uh camille greger who's on youtube he is a uh he's finishing
his ma and just starting his phd but he is an excellent resource uh who who is active on youtube
he has been doing some work looking into uh a number of uh these issues with not just new
testament literature but also with the manuscripts excuse me he put together a chart not that long
ago showing uh where the new testament manuscripts that we have were found relative to their dates
and what's really shocking in that is you you come to see that all the new testament manuscripts
that we have that are very early they all come from the same place so not only like how confident
can we be that this is representative of christendom as it was practiced in Ephesus and Corinth and Rome
or is this just representative of christendom as it was practiced in
Alexandria yeah the situation is that all of these really early manuscripts come from
the same place this one place and you think about the diversity of christianity like
back before the canon oh man marcian and the yeah like all like it was it was as wild
oh thank you nitty mithvision podcast said you guys just want to sin um thank you like i said
like you're porn and i i i like porn but i think my favorite tonight is scoffing
i went to facebook message of david so this is uh yeah we did okay so uh dj frank 68 said
why do you know scholars seem to have an issue i suppose my witness accounts written in third person
with an omniscient narrator oh see this is i think this is this is a uh i think i think
this is an indication of the power that apologetics has because scholars absolutely
do have a problem with this and it's tragic that we don't hear more about it scholars on
all sides of the spectrum are unanimous about the issues that the anonymity of the gospels
provide about the fact that they date that the manuscripts date as late as they are
are this is a consistent problem within scholarship that is completely ignored or just glossed over
by apologists um yeah 100 and it's just
yeah like you just said it perfectly it's like um i said this one on a swim the other day
but like we went to china we came back from china and we're showing some of our friendly
and fam my gosh family and friends um footage of the buddhist temples and some of the buddhist
temples in china that we went to in jeng zhaji they had like a buddha of the past a buddha of
the present a buddha of the future and they're all standing and it's like right this one takes care
of your past this one takes care of your future this one takes care of you you now and then there
was a wooden one but i'm explaining this all to everyone showing them all the footage of our holiday
and someone stood up abruptly uh angry to get a drink of water and said oh how can anyone
believe this crap and i was just like and i thought to myself like dog like you kind of believe in
like a god who sacrificed himself to himself to serve as a loophole for rules that he created
that he couldn't circumvent you believe in like zombies rising and marching on jerusalem you believe
that like there's going to be trumpets that can be heard across the entire earth as the angels come
down and like like you believe some wack stuff too my dude like if you if you look at it from an
outside perspective it's oh pretty bizarre so we'll get i i mean it's it is astonishing and we'll
we'll we'll probably mention it at some point but uh one of the things that strobel says within this
book is how much the gospels don't provide details of fanciful or miraculous or outlandish
uh events or occurrences and i'm like what i think and i think this is a product of how
much we by and large within western culture have been desensitized to what's actually
in the bible right what's actually in the gospels um so when you know a normal person
uh heals a man who's been blind from birth that's a big deal but when jesus does it it's just well
you know that's just that's just jesus he's just that's what he does it's you know so but i think
this is this is kind of we carried that forward and it it's it's kind of ingrained to the point
where we don't even see it anymore right um yeah it's it's it yeah um and lastly the last super chat
is i killed earl um i saw it earlier you said you know it's great that i'm live streaming and i'm
you know i'm i'm glad to see you in the comments again it's great to see a lot of um you guys and
some it's only been a week but it feels like forever the line is having a live stream call
enough on uh fundraiser for recovering from religion tomorrow starts at 4 p.m central

go i love the line i love those guys so yeah go um i might be there if i can um i might even call
in if i can and uh and help raise money um and uh and fundraise for recovering from religion
which is an excellent organization thank you i killed her for the 10 dollar super chat so
will you troll the line david i might i should try should try the line
i i've never i've never trolled the line before but i've been tempted
yeah that'd be great um we should uh we should do a group uh group one well um
yeah the deep drinks community comes out to troll the line uh to raise money um we should do that
it's it's it's however i mean the the the money raised is the important thing right
yeah exactly i know that uh back in the day um one of the most interesting calls on the
atheist experience with meadow hunting was his wife calling and pretending to be a troll and
be like have you looked at the trees have you looked at the trees and he didn't know and he's
like he's like what do you mean he's like it is it's really it's really funny um he's he's ex-wife
but um yeah i've often wondered i mean yeah no i don't know i've i've often wondered uh
what an apologetic would look like if i attempted to do one from the perspective of
everything that i know now oh maybe i'll do i do actually want to do an atheist bible study where
where we're doing a bible study but we're not allowed to say anything snarky we're not allowed
to say anything rude or or point out problems we're just to talk about the beautiful parts of the
bible and oh i could totally do that yeah yeah i think it'd be good because there's some good
stuff in there i think it'll you know i think if you're still sometimes like if i was in my
angry atheist edgelord stage i'd be i'd have problems with it like everything but i think
i've grown up a little bit and i think that you know i can i can i can get good stuff out of it
same with the koran or whatever even though it has some horrible stuff uh everywhere else so i
