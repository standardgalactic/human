I think this is where kind of like a difference between polytheists and atheists kind of comes into play
In that with polytheists will if there is a seeming that it is that there is a
Root of an experience external to oneself
We will embrace that and explore on that level
With a lot of atheists what I think happens is that they wind up seeing this kind of thing and they go and they conclude
therefore
This is something that is happening internal to my mind or my brain
Depending on the atheist right get mind brain conversations, but
That this is happening internally and therefore I'm going to explore it on the basis of that level
