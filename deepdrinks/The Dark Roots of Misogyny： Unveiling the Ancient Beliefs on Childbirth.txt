in the biblical world and antiquity,
and I'm sure it's more than just those in this region,
the man conceives, the women just carry,
they're just vessels.
So they imagine that the seed of the man
is actually what makes the child.
And like the woman just somehow was like
putting it in the oven for nine months and like,
oh, but if a woman can't get pregnant, right?
There's a whole lot of weird stuff that goes into this.
But if the woman can't get pregnant, it could be a demon,
a female demon, tell me there's not some misogyny
going on in antiquity here.
That like-
The Bible and misogyny?
No.
No, I know.
Rubbish.
