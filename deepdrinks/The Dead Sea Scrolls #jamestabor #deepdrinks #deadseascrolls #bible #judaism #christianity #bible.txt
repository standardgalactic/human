Dead Sea Scrolls. Everybody's heard of them, but very few people have read them. And I mean just
people out and even people that follow our channels and study a bit. You know, they might be able
to tell you about when they were discovered 1947, you know, 75, six years ago, and a few things.
But if you ask, well, have you ever read them or looked at them? So in this course, we actually
look at the scrolls and we answer that question.
