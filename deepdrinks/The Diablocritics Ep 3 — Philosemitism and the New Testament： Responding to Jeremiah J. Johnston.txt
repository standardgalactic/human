big feelings uh about about politics especially with what's what's going on in the uh ancient
Near East and in the modern world right now uh but our our purpose today is really specifically

looking for that that get promoted apologized apologized is a new word that i learned uh
i learned in the last few weeks and i i quite like that one um but yeah so uh so that's that
that's where we're at um i i guess maybe because we jumped right into this if if people don't know

wow all right so um today what i've uh what i've queued up for us is uh is a is a video
um on a show i'd never heard of before called uh i believe the channel is is just ali ali
beth stucky have you guys heard of ali beth stucky before not until okay it's the week oh okay new
new to gen but before i before i previewed the video and anybody ever heard of heard of this
person before dan have you heard of her yeah yeah uh i have been seeing her stuff being shared on
twitter uh and occasionally on instagram so somebody who's who's in that um in that evangelical
apologetic sphere and i've been seeing criticism of her stuff from inside and outside christianity so
i don't know a ton about her though okay um i i know nothing about her beyond beyond what i've
i've now watched on this show that she has uh i think i think several times a week actually called
relatable on her um on her channel and her channel has uh almost i i think it's almost
half a million uh subscribers it's a big it's a big channel right so i thought i thought this was
timely i thought it was pertinent and i have to confess um uh because it featured uh jeremiah j
johnston um i i took particular notice have you guys before before uh uh seeing the video had you
had you ever heard of uh of of dr jeremiah j johnston before i have not i've uh actually
uh made a couple of videos responding to some of his videos in the past no kidding yeah there
was a video he made where was that no go ahead um he made a video a while ago talking about the
the the 10 biggest uh discoveries in biblical archaeology there was an interview between him
someone else you remember that one and um i i found it the reason i was interested because he was
talking about being at oxford or well being in oxford in 2009 and i was like i was i was
doing a degree at the university of oxford in jewish studies in 2009 so i was like i wonder
what college he was in i would like to see who he was studying with and and um come to find out
that he was not at the university of oxford he was doing some program where he was located in the
city of oxford with all right this is where have we heard this before but but he he repeatedly
makes reference to being in oxford but never clarifies not at the university of oxford um
it's it's pretty sketchy uh the attempt to kind of um lull people into thinking that he was uh has
degrees from the university of oxford uh which is so listen yeah i did i did a i did a uh a video
response to to one of his appearances on on show mcdowell's channel with uh uh with our our
friend paul agia and uh and this is something that uh that he and i both picked up on but it's
something jeremiah certainly wants everybody to know about him i've just i've just got this little
this little clip bit here as an expert in apologetics you know here it is content that i
researched when we lived in oxford shan when i was in oxford if i'm gonna do what i was taught at
oxford living in oxford i heard all of the iron clad uh arguments that he was my examiner uh in
oxford so yeah listen if there's if there's one thing if there is one thing jeremiah wants
everyone to know guys he was at oxford yeah so yeah when i studied at the university of chicago
uh you know i was in the stacks i opened up a book and i i read something so i studied at the
university right just so so just so everyone's uh aware too like because i've done a little bit of
digging on this uh jeremiah did his uh his program at uh let me pull this up so i get this uh this
right uh he did his his degree is actually from middle six university which is in london and i'm
sure it's a fine school uh he graduated in 2012 but he was at a place called the oxford center
for mission studies and this is a place specifically designed for people going into uh mostly going
into foreign missions to give them like a year of a year of experience hanging out in the city of
oxford getting access to the uh oxford libraries and and some so you have to like you have to
memorize all the great commission passages that you're just like that must be in the king james
that's the key yeah so uh jeremiah's phd was uh was the resurrection of jesus in the gospel of
peter a tradition historical study of the ang uh sorry the akmim gospel fragment um i'm not sure
what that one is on another interest a note of of interest for me particular is that uh jeremiah
also did his ma at akadia divinity college or akadia university which is here in canada way on
the other side of the country in uh nova scotia uh but he worked very closely there
i think i think they must uh there was a there was a long time i i got i got pretty confused
about that when i was a kid uh for a long time so they have kind of a cajun accent is what you're
yeah and an acajun acajun i think is is how it is over there
all right let's get to the point yeah we've got some stuff to hurry uh yeah so jeremiah also
studied with uh craig a evans oh yeah uh who left he left trinity western uh a couple years
after i finished my ma to go to akadia divinity college um to to work on their program there
but anyways uh that's just some background of jeremiah uh shall we uh shall we start watching
this video so as always just uh let me know where i need to stop it i've got i've got four sections
sort of set off um but uh i'll i'll play and until someone tells me that we need to stop
not every christian understands the significance of israel and obviously that's been in the news
probably more than ever in recent history at least um so talk to us a little bit more about
the biblical significance of israel why christians need to care about it we care about israel because
our g our savior the lord jesus christ is a still a jewish man we follow a jewish savior and so if
we care about jesus i'm i'm very bad at this stuff this will not be unlike our other great videos in
the past so yeah that deserves the show today is no exception to some of the great work that
i've done in the past there we go so uh there it is okay so everyone can see it can't they yes
now we can okay all right good i'll press play why christians need to care about it we care about
israel because our g our savior the lord jesus christ is a still a jewish man we follow a jewish
savior and so if we care about jesus we should care about jews jesus is a jewish man he is born
in the line of juda this is one of the best established facts of the ancient world i would
say it this way alibeth if we can't believe jesus is a god i'm sorry like that when i heard that
i just thought it's one of the best established facts in the ancient world that jesus was from
the line of juda yeah just think about that for a second yeah there's a lot of conflation going on
there i think and and i just i'm gonna say it now instead of waiting until later like also
why do we need a reason like this to care about jews like they're humans that's why we need to
care about them his reasoning for caring about jews is a part of the whole anti-judaic thing he
actually has going on and so i'm just yeah no you don't care about jews because jesus care about
jews spoiler alert that's right yeah yeah it's yeah it's it's a weird it's it really is just a
just a weird uh way to uh to set your priorities i guess right but um it's it's not unlike um
you know i've got a black friend it's it right it's it's partly that but it's even worse given
the what else he's gonna say about it all right you know it's it's true yeah it's true so um but
maybe should should we say something about uh about the the established facts of jesus
certainly relative to the existence of the roman empire how confident are we about uh about the
fact there was a roman empire you're no you're not head yeah am i yes you are maybe not uh oh
should i you jump the head but we can talk about the juda thing right yeah let's let's talk about
that yeah where where are the historical facts that point at a tribe juda yeah so so what do we have
we have the secondary yeah matthew look the secondary accounts they're not in mark because
his lineage wasn't relevant to the earliest traditions uh it wasn't until they later decided
we need to go back further that we gin up two different uh genealogical backgrounds uh and then
yeah so yeah it's just a laughable claim about just remind you dan best established fact in
all of ancient history well i mean not to mention just the other issue of which guy are we even talking
about that is this jesus you know like the historical jesus thing in general much less
the biblical tradition yeah right but i i think i mean for for us it's the most important thing
here is just that when you're talking about historical facts like one of the one of the
first things that you would question when you're reading chronologically through through the
gospels is like wait where did this genealogy come from and what's its purpose and how did it get
right and it's very very firmly established consensus that these are not actual genealogies
but that are constructed for the place that they're in and they don't match right so it's it's
just such a silly thing to say that this is the best the most firmly established historical fact
of and right and other people are gonna just repeat that because he said it right additionally
the the whole point is that jesus was jewish and somehow this establishes that like you don't
have to be from the tribe of juda to be jewish and and this kind of to me there there's this
this creeps into dangerous territory with kind of bloodline ideas about you know pure jewish
person or something like that i mean he's identified as as jewish throughout the text is in the right
time in the right place to be a jewish individual what other data is necessary right i mean um you
know we're getting into like real jewish person kind of territory by saying uh we can establish
that he descended from the house of juda yeah yeah yeah that's true so um i thought i'd just give a
shout out here to a friend of ours uh paul agia says jeremiah now gives him intellectual uh ptsd
and uh i'm i'm sorry about that paul i really am um so yeah but that's uh let's continue yeah to see
what he has to say here okay all jesus death by roman crucifixion his life is burial his death
we can build these facts which we have about 60 to 65 facts historically within 100 years of the
life of jesus before i ever open my bible so i'm not just waving my bible around on your program
i'm appealing to roman historians like tacitus swatonius lucian other artifactual remains
here's a cool one did you know that jesus's name is known to have before we continue i have to just
tell everybody that i had a dream last night that uh that swatonius was actually the correct
way of pronouncing
i i woke up in a small spot
oh dear how were his lifetime of course he was in the gospels remember jesus's disciple said
master you know people are casting out demons in your name should we stop them and jesus said no
let him use my name and you wrote we just because of our historical distance cannot overemphasize
and even understand how important it is they're using jesus's name for miracles and for exorcisms
while jesus is alive yeah wow if he's not a jew then why are jewish exorcists using his name
and why do we have artifacts even curses that they might not know the gospel but they knew
there was power with this name jesus i mean we read the genealogy of jesus yes matthew can we can
we pause this uh if you don't mind i think this this might be a reference to one of these artifacts
from that uh ten biggest artifacts there was a cup that was discovered um i think under water
near alexandria and uh it it has the word um oh gosh you make me remember this crap um
it's supposed to be prepared ahead of time dan i don't even want to talk about how busy i have been
yeah i was gonna say dad this is all you guys i have to i have to google my own video so i can
remind myself oh god um yeah there are top biblical archaeological discoveries of time
wait for 15 seconds we had to play on my own video but it's it's a cup that's uh that says like
i think it has the word um crestoy or something like that on there that's not entirely clear
that's a reference to yeah but it's uh it was it's dated to like 40 or 50 c e and he's like this
demonstrates that it christianity was already in alexandria and all this stuff but um wow
and it's not it's definitely not a reference to jesus it is another ad
and this is on me because i'm like yeah mid roll ads go ahead
but uh and it's uh it's about a magician or something like that according to uh to his
reading and it is yeah he's misreading the whole thing you have to um assert that
certain letters are completely different letters and then that they've misspelled stuff
and well and he's yeah the fact that he's saying again he's referencing passages in
in the gospels as if that's historically accurate as well i mean you know of course
he's gonna do that because that's his part of his thing but he is doing that again and it's
it's just kind of embarrassing to okay so here we go we got ho he stays via christo uh christo
and he translates it as the chanter through christ uh but uh christo is is spelled uh
he wrote uh eta sigma uh tau omicron um epsilon and so it's an eta not uh an iota for one and it's
also um the i think something is uh we've the chanter is actually uh i i think a plural uh now
and what they have but it just it doesn't work at all but um and the way he presents it it's
very clear that his greek is rusty at best no maybe maybe he should have spent a little
bit more time at oxford yeah so um yeah there's no way for that to make it to turn into christo
so what is so what is this where he he he says um he's making this connection right we know he
he's jewish because other other jews are using his name right what's that about like i have no idea
i i think it's a reference to this cup the the idea that this is a this cup is is some inscription
that a jewish person commissioned or or so it was found in in like a jewish i think it was found
in a shipwreck off of alexandria and and well no you it's um it's circular reasoning if you
interpreted as jesus then it must have a jewish origin or something like that because because of
how early he dates it he's saying this is before you have christianity uh okay there's a separate
movement wow yeah but i also agree kit that's just a we it seems like a weird thing to say that
because in the gospels there's stories where people are said to have used jesus's name
therefore jesus was a jew like it's like the logic
i mean i don't know i'm just saying there's 65 facts and artifacts you know i wanted to
know what the list was i yes and there i think there's another conflation right i think he's
taking like 65 because i hear this often from uh evangelical apologists 65 uh like independent
sources for the the life of jesus or independent mentions of jesus probably mentions and probably
mentions and probably not treating the overlapping oh well never mind that doesn't apply if you're
well if you're talking about outside the bible i mean you've got you've got jocephus you've got
tachytus you've got uh pliny swaytonius uh yeah blue suede tonius uh and within within a century
he said and and if you want to go beyond that you're you're just making stuff up you're you're
i just i wonder if it's like what titus kennedy does if you guys have read his book like um
you know he'll he'll say oh you know like look we have the lament over the destruction of sumer and
or and he'll have like a page and a half about it and then he'll say at the very end and this is
likely the time of abraham and that's right that's it what oh yeah exactly okay excuse the genetics
yeah okay
meghead uh should we continue yes please there's there's there's quite a bit more there is
historical documents right and so i i don't know there's probably something a little sinister
behind any motivations right well there's anti-semitism and it's been around sadly for a long time you
actually have a coin that i gave to you if you don't mind holding up the bronze coin which is the
larger one ali beth i want to just make sure our audience knows palestine is a word that hadrian
the roman emperor in the second cemetery renamed the land of israel as i never used the word palestine
when i talk about the land of israel after the third which was a bloody jewish revolt under simon
barkokba that'd be that's 132 to 135 ad if you're following along with us hadrian lost so many in
the roman legions at the hands of the jews he renames jerusalem to aliyah capitalina which is
called essentially the capital of jupiter and that bronze coin which is very rare was in circulation
in the second century we didn't have social media in the second century right so if you wanted to
know what was going on you looked at your coins who won the battle who was in charge and we know
from that coin that hadrian renames the city so it's no longer jerusalem and he renames the region
palestine so that is a pejorative term i never refer to israel as palestine or the palestinian
right and um when you were flying excuse me yes i like watching your facial expressions
so wait but is he is he saying that that he thinks that hadrian is the first mention of
palestine is that i mean am i or am i interpreting right so does he not know that herodotus says
that in the fifth century bc like yeah or that it's mentioned a bunch of other times and including
by jocephus and right i mean i think what he's fifth century bc we have mentioned of that as
palestine well i think we even have don't don't we even have issyrian stuff that that uses a term
for the region that looks like a cognate of of palestine i'm pretty sure we do
yeah it's not like a i don't know how strong the argument is that that it's a uh a cognate but
but i do but by a herodotus yeah absolutely they are referring to parts of this territory
probably syria and the coastal regions there is there is an inconsistency judia is a name for
around jerusalem but at the same time there are people who seem to be referring to the whole
general area as as palestine as well so there's inconsistency it seems to me he's trying to suggest
jerusalem specifically was never officially named palestine until hadrian therefore it is
um and imposed pejorative designation so he doesn't want to call it those other things
also uh cap capital lina uh what's what's the term that uh that was used for for Jerusalem that
that hadrian applied to it capital lina um aioli capital lina aioli capital lina that that doesn't
mean uh that doesn't mean jerusalem of jupiter jupiter i mean it's as far as i know um that
as far as i'm aware this is this is a family name right that uh that hadrian adopted for himself
uh and he called a bunch of different places um hey alina whatever jerusalem was just one of them
um yeah i don't know a lot about this history alia alia yeah yeah this is this is a plebeian
family in rome which flourished in the fifth century bc until at least the third century
ad according to wikipedia so but yeah jupiter is not jupiter it's not jupiter
it's it's not jupiter people also i mean there was a lot like i know that it's it's um
people like attaching the name change to the results of the jewish war right the the second
jewish war but i mean there was a there was a lot going on there um the uh and the province i believe
was was named syria palestine wasn't it by uh by hadrian yeah to include syria right because
i don't know because the jewish war that doesn't that doesn't track that doesn't make a lot of
sense to me i think i think we all agree this is just uh bad everything so it's pretty bad
you noticed that and i think we have a picture of it that they don't even the airlines don't even
put the anti-semitism on some of american airlines one world partners is something i want to call out
it concerns me i love american airlines i'm an executive platinum i've ride the american
airline systems to speak i'm on stop stop stop and you know how you're sitting you're
he's an executive platinum right yeah right for the number of because of how often he travels i'm
assuming right when you get a degree from oxford you know you just had your your executive platinum
car with your degree right yeah i don't understand how that was relevant at all but yes no he just
the keep right i just i get that really caught my attention i'm impressed i i had great admiration
i've retract any mean thing i've said i'm a gold member at alvi i hope he'll give me a free
upgrade sometime if i run into him at the airport we we have a costco card
it's too late anyway sorry sorry sorry sorry the board out of your mind and all you can
do is sit and look at the map in front of you right and i'd be kind of like jostled i said wait a
minute it says we're flying over the palestinian territories and if you look at this image it
doesn't even say the land of israel as if israel doesn't even even exist and there's over a hundred
airlines that's what they that's what the palestinian activists say from the river to the palestine they
won't stop until that happens it's even so we see that anti-semitism creeping in and this is why
back to your original question every believer in jesus christ should support israel does that
just say i mean i don't know that we'll have time to play the the piece you had recorded with
visha is that her name vishanti vishanti i'm not familiar with her but you know she pointed out
that the river to the sea is talking about you know the the region of gaza from the jordan river
on the east to the sea on the west it's not about not it's not about saying israel doesn't exist it's
about talking about a swath of land for palestine it's people misunderstand misinterpret that i think
is part of what she was trying to highlight for us on that and i feel like yeah made that implication
at least that or she did when she talked about from the river to the sea um as if that means
no israel but that's not what that phrase is about i'm not deeply informed on it i was just
taking that cue from pretty sure now i think this has been like i think this is this is as as all
slogans are this is this has been been picked up and used and abused in all sorts of ways right
but i think what what you're getting at jen is is exactly right that the spirit of it in its origin
is about uh oh i mean i yeah it is about um just establishing palestinian independence
vis says give us you know just yeah just give us yeah what everybody else has right so it it um
from the river the jordan river to yeah to to the Mediterranean sea but um i maybe i'll i'll just
i'll just wait until the the conclusion of this clip and we don't have time to go through the
whole thing but i'll play a little bit uh josh had a uh a a very sensible idea uh approaching
today's stream since not one of the five of us is is jewish it's always useful to get to get
you know a jewish perspective on topics related to anti-semitism and to phylo-semitism
so i reached out to a mutual friend of several of ours uh vis shanti she's active in our community
she's active on youtube and she and i had a had a one hour conversation and i might put the whole
thing up on my channel at some point but i i i pulled out some some clips i'll play one of those
when we're done here but she's got some some very pertinent thoughts uh about exactly what's going on
here so maybe i'll just uh we'll continue with this to the end of this section here
modern state of israel absolutely not i don't agree with everything in the modern
united states government do we we certainly don't but i do support the jewish right to exist
so and the conflation there between the jewish right to exist and conflating that with israel
it's just it's basic just under informed way of talking right
it totally is i just i i'm i'm i'm i'm jones and to get to some other stuff that we had that
yeah so i think i think before we do i'm just going to uh i'll play a clip here from uh from
from the talk that uh that vishanti and i um had the other day and uh and then we can we can
continue here we're loving loving any culture is part of that from a quote on quote christian
worldview is also bearing the gospel right yeah you know we love you know we love the we love the
jewish people so much that were were duty bound to try and convert them it was impossible to see
while i was still a christian but the longer that i'm not i'm not it becomes easier to see
just how completely irreconcilable these two things are christian conversion of jewish people is a
form of it's a it's a form of cultural denigration as much as anything as charged and looted as the
word is right now mass converting jews to christianity is a form of cultural genocide
being jewish has some pretty firm red lines around it like the way that we've defined ourselves
does not include jesus is the messiah outsiders don't get to tell us well actually yes you could
still be jewish and recognize that jesus is the messiah because he's jewish and like he's your king
so like you should accept him you don't get to tell me how to be jewish and you don't get to tell me
what being jewish is if you're not a jew there's such a historical failure here too right because
it's pretending that the the religious political situation in first century palestine is something
that we can just transplant into the the 21st century right without recognizing that christianity
and judaism as they exist in the modern world have been defined over centuries now millennia
of development through this yeah spent 2 000 years defining who they are and who are who they're not
and they're still going through it because christian and christianity is known for its schisms
if you want to be a jesus believer go for it i'm not going to stop you you're welcome to do that
live your best life but leave us alone if you were to try to convert jews in mass you're literally
saying we want to get rid of jews because if they all converted to christianity there would be no
jews left that's right so um there's there's lots of good stuff in it so i think i will uh i will
probably just just publish the whole thing at at one point but she makes a number of of
uh i think pertinent observations about and and it's the sort of thing too where
um one of the things that we see in in modern evangelicalism in the united states in particular
is is this uh this strong notion of returning to some sort of jewish roots of the religion
um and people just i think people just fail to understand uh just even even what early christianity
looked like and and i i don't know like it it what what do you guys think about that about the
plausibility of of returning to like or or even knowing what an what an early jewish form of
or we even what was that the the the early jewish forms of christianity it was greco roman
jewish to begin with um there's there's a wonderful book written by my um my thesis supervisor
at the actual university of oxford uh his name was uh or it still is timothy michael law he wrote
a wonderful book called when god spoke greek which is about the influence of the septuagint
on the the context for the rise of christianity and i i've heard different names torah observant
messianic judaism uh hebrou roots stuff uh these are these are attempts to try to
appropriate basically jewish cultural features for christianity even though the earliest christians
would have uh been speaking uh greek or if not greek then aramaic but uh overwhelmingly greek
yeah and and i mean i think this is one of those things that is really easy to um to to
misunderstand or to confuse because there's been this idea that there was a massive jewish movement
of jesus followers that then went out into the world and and and you know made these
disciples of all nations or whatever um where where when you read the the new testament carefully
and look back at early church history what's really happening is communities are developing
pretty much all over the place that's not it within judaism and the early christians are those
those communities right and so like there there is some early jewish christians
that are that the christianity is coming in in some jewish communities but the vast majority
are happening in in syria they're happening in in asia minor they're happening in the roman empire
in other places like dan said and and so it's it's not always easy for people that are trying to
make sense of their new testament and their christianity to understand that this wasn't
that that this wasn't just a jewish movement but it was very very very quickly a movement of
some people who uh had been or who were jews telling other people within the roman empire hey
listen this and those people were from their own cultural perspectives uh joining this movement
and that is why all these debates happen in early christianity about how one should interact with
judaism do you have to conform to the to the laws do you have to become circumcised and follow
kosher laws and all that right so it's it's really important to to actually think about what's going
on in early christianity when we're trying to talk about early christianity as a jewish movement
right yeah right it's a converse yeah it was a react bringing others in that weren't behaving
according to such you know those laws and those practices that was being welcomed this new group
of people yes and what does it mean yeah missing also missing from this conversation i feel very
much so is just the tone deafness with regards to you know 1500 or 1800 years of christian history
and jewish history right and and just how how you know how much the persecution of the church
of jews for hundreds of years uh deeply affected and shaped their own theology and their own identity
and and worldview i you know i can't help but also want to say
that the the definitions that paul put forward ultimately end up being very anti-judaic right
the the ideas that christianity is founded upon right and so when you have someone who's a super
conservative evangelical trying to say that he loves jews um he's very ignorant of his own
theological like the implications of his own theology he's ignorant of the church history
he's ignorant of a lot of things that have gone on that are that if you can look at it a little
from a just you know step back a little bit um you you just you don't get to say
like i don't you know i know there are people who identify as messianic jews and
or um yeah right messianic jews and jewish christians and i understand that but i also
think that those are spaces that are not well informed on what the two or three different
ideas that they're juggling are actually saying on their own terms so that when they're mixing it
all together they they aren't aware of the contradictions or the you know and and that's
fine if that's what they want to do but it just yeah okay i think what is is my microphone better
now okay yeah i was one of the one of the settings had gotten messed up um it it seems to be kind of
an identity marker these days that this uh filo semitism and it seems that people are seeking out
rationalization and reinforcement for the legitimacy of this identity marker even
if they have to reach two folks who are not qualified to speak about this and and they're
going to reinforce that this identity marker using uh false claims about archaeological discoveries
very thin very sophomoric readings of biblical texts and and they're going to appeal to
pretty blight anti-semitism along the way to try to to prop up this identity marker of real
christians love jewish folks but we love jewish folks in a real christian anti-semitic kind of
way exactly so it's it's about trying to gin up some kind of authoritative reinforcement for
our anti-semitic filo semitism yeah and i you know i know we haven't gotten to this point in the
video but i'm just i'm just dying to get it out there so i'm just going to just just bear with
me um because he does he's he talks for a decent amount of time about romans 9 to 11 which i just
have to be very honest my next book is on paul and i am dreading dreading having to deal with
those three chapters um right and so those in that in that section is where it talks about
all of israel being redeemed or being saved and this this premise that christians have
over the centuries clung to that no no jews really will come around to to loving jesus and i'm
i'm going to put a link in the in the in the comments because you know martin luther of
reformation fame believed just what we hear daramaya johnston saying here which is the
jews are good and love and god loves them and they are going to be saved and and martin luther
believed that at the beginning of his minister well i think he started out headed into the priesthood
and by the end of his life he was writing horrific things about the jews so i shared a link to
some segments of the jews and their lies and and just even the the pieces that are clipped
in that on that website are they are so disturbing it is unnerving to me he talks about you know
burning synagogues and he talks about destroying these people this is martin luther right like
16th century we're not talking holoca right so i just i was so i was like vibrating as i was
listening to jeremiah talk about these things because it's like yeah you don't get it you
not only is it on a like just linguistically and definitionally he doesn't get it but this is not new
this has been what christians have been doing and saying and believing and nobody right so i
i always try to make sure students know about that like the the some of the things that are
described that martin luther put in writing in the mid 16th century look like what some of the
things that were happening during world war two and during the holocaust like this is right so
serious implications that's what i've been dying to say i'm muted yeah well maybe let's let's uh
unless unless someone has has anything else to to finish up with maybe let's just move on to the
next section here right so we need to make sure we read the bible we don't let other you know learn
from everyone but don't let anyone think for you good be a good bible based christian form your
worldview from what the scripture actually says yes and amen all right let's talk about the scriptures
and the reliability of the scriptures can you tell us why we should rely on the 66 books of the
bible why not the other books like the book of thomas or the apocrypha why do we have this canon
and why should we trust it now you may not be aware but i have a phd so that means i know a lot about
a little in my area of specialty ali beth that i know a lot about the little end is the second century
what some kind of call apocrypha what i call the extra canonical gospel so my area of specialty
is actually all those books that didn't make it into the canon i spent three years of my life
reading them there's the catholic apocrypha which is depending on how you count them 11 12 maybe 13
books that are in intertestamental books these books are excellent books you should read them you
heard it right you should read them they're excellent books when gerome includes the intertestamental
apocrypha which is different from the jewish pseudepigrapha and even more different from the
new testament apocrypha okay so this is why these distinctions are important um he includes these
books he says they're helpful but not sacred it's likely that jesus would have read all of the what
we call the catholic apocrypha for these are books like first maccabees second maccabees ali
beth these are super inspirational text if you're a jew and late second temple judeism with the roman
occupational but not inspired exactly inspirational not inspired inspirational not inspired guys
i mean i agree i'm not he's not wrong they're inspirational they're not inspired
you would broaden the scope of that though be well and i think that's actually what his
doctoral dissertation was i don't i'd just check to see if i have it real quick but i think it was
like a uh a thorough defense of why the 27th book uh new testament is exactly uh right and all of
those really are inspired and all the others are not if if i recall i i don't think i have his um
his dissertation saved but the title of it i'll just i'll just remind everyone what the what the
title of the dissertation was um oh there it is uh the resurrection of jesus in the gospel of
peter a tradition historical study of the achmeme gospel fragment so it's but yeah maybe it was another
master's thesis or something like that he has written on on the canon yes i just i i can
yeah sorry and actually sorry it's a little it's a little off topic but i think important
and jennifer i'd like to get your opinion on this um every clip that we've watched and maybe it's
because he we've sped up the the recording and maybe that's why it comes across that way i'm
not sure but he really seems to be talking down to her do you do you pick up like can you hold
that coin up yeah go ahead hold that coin up you know like it's um i don't know it it just feels uh
i don't know uh you you may not know this but i have a phd it just i think we should all practice
saying that by the way because you know it's an important thing to do when you get interviewed
it's like saying uh if you have to say if you have to tell somebody you're a superintendent
you're not a superintendent right like if you have to tell them that you're their boss then
you're not um that's what that felt like to me but do you do you feel that or is it just the
recording the way that we've sped it up or am i on to something here i think it's a little bit of
both i think because i read him trying to kind of pan like reach people in general by the way he
keeps very what is sometimes within evangelical space is seen as a very relational thing to do
which is to constantly refer to the person's name and you know be very you know always right this
kind of but um so i don't know that i necessarily actually had a strong reaction to that as you
did but i think of it more as a function of that space in general but there is there's certainly
some of that for sure yeah he is a he is a pastor at a at a very large mega church in texas by the
way he's oh so then i think definitely is that yeah i mean i think i tried to ignore it the
condescension so since you've asked maybe the more i reflect on it i'm like oh yeah i guess it did
bother me but i just knew i wasn't gonna like what he was saying in general so yeah i mean i can
imagine that you see this every day all day maybe a reason people talking at me it's just not the
worst that i've seen today so oh dear i can i interrupt what i saw one just one comment and
it could be just but one person did say no ton i'm a prog i hope you teach your students that luther
was not a racist anti-semite you are misrepresenting him otherwise and i just want to be clear that the
link i shared is has has clip has pulled out like i didn't create it right someone else has created
it but you can go get a separate the whole writing yourself the jews and their lies and just from the
name itself should tell you something about how anti-judaic it is um and then the writing in it is
terrifying right it's it is so i don't know where that person gets the idea but my understanding is
when you are speaking not just hateful things but also untrue hateful things about a group of people
that is what we call an ism of some sort that is the very definition of anti-judaic behaviors and
beliefs is exactly what you see in that writing it's a great example of anti-judaic or anti what
people call anti-semitic but i prefer the word anti-judaic um writing and thinking and it's very
dangerous i think yeah and he hated the the the anabaptist too as a as a menonite background
believer redaptizing people he didn't like you oh man so we grew up with all these horrible
stories about luther and then i moved to norway and went to a lutheran seminary and everybody
would love luther and and i remember one time somebody had this big talk about like the how
um how luther really wasn't that bad uh and i was like uh by the way have you read what he says
about the anabaptist and the jews and it was all and everybody was all like um i don't know it was
like yeah they probably hadn't that's the thing they probably yeah yeah they're not not real
interested in that part so yeah so the 66 books of the canon guys the the 66 books
inspire inspirational or sorry uh other other jewish literature inspirational but not inspired
i don't know uh i i've certainly spent quite a bit of time matthew as well
uh working on questions of this nature right what did what did the landscape look like
in early judyism with regards to ideas surrounding quote unquote scripture
authoritative writing canon which is a terribly anachronistic term to apply to the period which
is why nobody does anymore um yeah it's it it's it's just such a i mean from my perspective it's
just such a sign of historical illiteracy and and no idea about the conversations that have been
taking place for the last 30 years 40 years at least so well and for them it's about the the
language of inspiration and then being inspired is is sacred you know this the you know the belief
in every word is as god directed in a very channeling kind of a way without realizing
that it's a channeling kind of a thing you're talking about but specifically the protestant canon
oh that's true right yeah so so people are aware there there are several there are several
different church canons um yes you know the the catholic church has one the eastern orthodox
the the opian church has their own it's it's it's it's it's pretty broad so yeah well i can i bring
it can i bring attention to a comment from jay pasick because i think it's sort of is is really
important here he says uh digital homerabi takes five of you to go after this johnston
he must be a real threat it's all your liberal scholarship and this is it right uh nail in the
head right um yeah saying the saying the quiet thing out loud thank you
that's it um i'm eager to get to the part where he's talking about counter there are
no contradictions in scripture i you know is that uh is that in the next section or is that in the
third the one after that well let's just let's just keep going let's transition out of the second
century gospels like thomas you just asked about the gospel of peter um these texts um the first
thing i share with my students and always pastorally but have you actually read them before you asked
me why they're not included in the library called the bible that's what the bible is the bible is
a library of 66 books have you actually read any of the but the quote unquote gospels have you
actually read them because the gospel of peter which is late second century it's written in greek
we only have one copy of it it's been lost it's called p kyro set 10 759 it was lost in the kyro
museum um some believe this was the first gospel ali beth and here's some of the features jesus is
a giant so he's like a member of the avengers team he's like the hulk when he comes out of the tomb
the cross follows him out of the tomb the cross talks there's polymorphic christology and polymorphic
angelology that what does that mean that's kind of a weird big word it means christ gets bigger and
bigger and he's even taller than the clouds um you actually have jews that are having a spending
the night in a cemetery waiting to see what happens at the resurrection you can see immediately
this was a very unsophisticated author who knows nothing of the land of israel knows nothing of
jewish customs and yet the liberals the skeptical scholars these are groups that come out of
helmut kester school in harvard divinity college i wouldn't send my dog to go to school there i'm
sorry to say that on your show but i'm not sorry not sorry so i i just have to say i'm i'm i'm
betting that his dog probably couldn't get into harvard divinity
i mean it's yeah it's just an odd insult really
they think these are these reveal something of the historical jesus they don't they are
wonderful windows into second third fourth fifth century christian communities but just because
they say the gospel of thomas do not rip out thomas who thinks that the speaking cross has
something about the historical jesus like nobody takes that part of it seriously
helmut kester evidently that inanimate objects talked in back in the first century okay yeah
what's going on i think i'm so confused like by what he's trying to argue like that these are
he's saying this might be the first gospel and it was already a legend
but i think i think what he's saying is is we have our 66 books and people who think it's
anything else are idiots who think like helmut kester that's the gospel of peter is historical
so it's appealing to the most ludicrous example to try to characterize everyone
oh yeah i'm just trying to say that you're all idiots if you think anything not in the bible
is true yeah is that yeah i think he's trying to make a qualitative difference here too between
the the four gospels and the and the rest of them in terms of you know them being uh really
dominate historical whereas you know the four gospels are like totally yeah and the relevance
guys the relevance to the rest of the discussion i have no clue right right they did shift gears
for sure at that they sure did yeah so and he has a tendency to do this yeah but i mean kip i think
we see this right like um this is sort of standard operating procedure we did that 86 hour stream
the other day uh about about slavery right and it's just it's all about look at all these terrible
laws about slavery and the laws of hamer abbey and and all these terrible uh ants about them
stuff but look the hebron bible these are the like these are the best are they ideal no but
they're the best so yep no i i think it's right in the same vein that you're right josh all right
well peter they're not written by peter so have you actually read them
why do we have the gospels in the bible the big g gospels matthew mark luke and john
because they exhibit what's called verisimilitude that's a really cool word i want your audience
to get to know veritas latin you've said that word on your show similitude it's very similar
how do we know what truth is truth corresponds to me can we just pause it because i want to
let the audience know something this guy's real smart you haven't picked up one real smart
but he totally misrepresent veritas you've said that yeah but wait he says verisimilitude means
they're very similar i know and that's not what verisimilitude means tell us dan what is verisimilitude
me having the the appearance of being true they they to say these two texts have verisimilitude
or these four texts are very that means they're very similar is uh fundamentally misunderstands the
word do you think maybe he just looked at that and said oh it sure sounds like very similar
i i think that's exactly what happened but i think but he's like he's just trying to pave
the way for what he's gonna do later right yeah he's just he's just trying to build this kind of
like the line of authority or of um cool vow they have um sorry my Norwegian's flying out
not the english word it's like reliability like he's he's trying to say that there are reasons why
and because then he's gonna do like yeah maybe we'll get there but he's gonna do the whole thing
we're like because then obviously only these books are inspired and then he's gonna say and thus then
we should like believe them and all this it's accurate and so he's like has this like line of
logic he's doing and i think he uses this like i think i don't think he's doing this like randomly
right here i think he has this in as a as a ploy you know to get you on board he you use the big
words and you get people to understand you know what you're saying and then you move through these
steps that that you kind of can't question so yeah yeah you you got to gin up a sense of authority
so that by the time you drop the hammer everybody assumes that you can drop it without arguments
and be right yeah right what you're talking about so very similatutely
comes from very similar dude right yeah i'm pressing play put up matthew mark
luke and john everything i read about it from the geographical nature the names the places it's all
accurate here's a cool thing alibaba i would summarize it this way when you go to the land of
israel there's about a hundred archaeological digs these digs only happen twice a year because you
recruit college students who come at their own expense to volunteer these are very expensive digs
okay like you got to make sure you're digging in the right spot and so there i am at one of these
digs and most of the digs are sponsored by secular organizations so there's no christian bias in fact
there's a bias to not believe not in the bible and yet i began to notice that the archaeologists
who are jewish agnostic leaning towards atheists they use six books to make sure they're digging
in the right spot you may have heard of some of these six books are you ready for these
matthew mark luke john the book of acts in flavius josephus so if they're not reliable
why in the world are jewish atheist archaeologists using them to make sure that they're digging
in the right spot because they exhibit bare similitude with jesus and judaica in other words
they are reliable historical sources oh he used it right there again i'm yeah i think he used maybe
he was yeah maybe he was uh his explanation was was toying with the way they sounded the same but
he intended something else yeah but yeah that i promise you no archaeologists in israel are actually
carrying these six books around and saying they're saying we're not digging in the right spot we got
to go dig in the other spot what the i mean you know i can go ahead josh i was just like should we
point out historically the problem perhaps with thinking that archaeologists do this
with you know the whole bible in one hand spate in the other the albright
of uh you know let's let's use the heber bible to go out there and dig and then realizing as you
do so throughout the 20th century shit we talked about this in the very first episode we did yep you
know the so where where probably not the flex yeah this is probably not a path he wants to go down
yeah probably not probably not no that's true a historian so right now ali beth and i are not
getting in some kind of religious trance as far as i know we're just doing history we're talking
like two clear thinking people we're not we're not doing this based on emotion or feeling if i
want to know something of history i want early eyewitness tradition i want to get as close to
the event as i can and i want to find artifactual remains what do we have when we open up the
gospels the very same thing within 50 years we have letters that are circulating remember the
letters of paul anti-date they pre-date the gospels we have thessalonians it's probably
the first book written in the new testament probably in the 40s i read a pure reviewed
article this week at the time that we're recording holy week that mark might be dated as early as the
40s or 50s i'm not saying i agree with that but i wonder where that pure reviewed article was
published yeah me too just just just saying can you believe that why do we second guess the books
of the of the bible because we have this hyper skepticism towards them and so when you study
the 5800 greek fragments of the new testament as i have you can go to mount aphos by the way
there's a thousand greek fragments there you'll see that he's the gospels begin trying what's
that he studied all he studied all he didn't study all of them and the overwhelming majority of them
come from more than 800 years after they were initially composed right but you can chart the
5700 give or take greek manuscripts of the new testament like there are maybe there are less
than half a dozen from the second century there are maybe 20 from the third century and then
the overwhelming majority of them are from 900 ce and later and nobody studies those because they
don't have text critical value your their their copies of copies of copies of copies from centuries
later um that yeah that this this is just propping up one's uh one's authority and by the way somebody
says i completely misrepresented his very similar to thing i did because his his initial representation
of it was uh was making it sound like he was saying they were very similar uh because he said
very similar uh but yeah i was i spoke too quickly there about that i was wrong so
well he was more clear the second time yeah i mean he was that's yes let's give him some
credit for that but you know the first mistake was made traveling together at the earliest stages
you mean we have fragments Jeremiah like the chester beady papyrus that are in Dublin Ireland
you can go see it second century these books are already traveling together by the way that's
long before constantine we have an embarrassment of riches when we look at the historicity of
jesus and i often say this and i say it that's why i hope you'll encourage people to get my body
approved bible study because i really want people to know this if i can't believe in jesus of nazareth
from the historical documents that we call the bible i shouldn't believe in the roman empire i
shouldn't believe in alice here we go here's a great comparison alexander the greats two primary
sources he's never questioned over here at our state universities arian and plutarck alibeth
they're writing 400 years later after the fact can i just can i pause for a second yeah um i shared
my screen would you mind just sharing that for a second because i just want to just want to point
something out um so that people kind of have a feel um this is and i just i just pulled this is
the etc sl the electronic text corpus of somerian literature i think matt probably just got a little
excited um i got i got chills it like is it kind of was one of those big ones you know so uh this
is somerian that my uh my dissertation i mean my um phd advisor paul down there wrote on these 10
texts uh called the decad and this is i just pulled the first one up shulgi a um and they're
they're pretty well represented they were part of the scribal curriculum they date to you know
1800 around that time just sort of go around there um and and this this is just the first of the 10
that were copied and these are just the ones that we found okay um if you go down to the bottom
you'll see the manuscripts that we have that have been used to put this together they start
right here with cuneiform sources
this is just for this text so everything what you're saying josh is everything in those texts is true
obviously because look how many there are right right so i mean like and and these come from 1800
bce right that they're they're 1800 so they're much earlier and they're you know these are these
have like lots of these have like um many of these cuneiform tablets will have like thumb prints in
them of the of the this tribe right so they must be truer i mean i just and so but josh is this the
one where he's he's um born born by a dragon and yes uh yeah this is yeah so this is true i mean
so yeah it has to be yeah that's great yeah so anyway just thought to kind of put that out there
like just because we have lots of little right manuscript fragments you know for particulars
likes yeah doesn't it may give it more verisimilitude but um and also the uh the alexander the great
argument it's it's one thing to say that the main sources we use for his life are date too much later
but we have coinage that date to his life yeah like we can point to stuff that and and i think people
who who hear that oh these sources different so much later are probably not aware that scholars
have been arguing for generations over what to accept as historical and what to reject
as ideology as dogma the exact same way they argue about the gospels and what should be accepted
as historical and what should be rejected as ideological um fabrication so the these things
are all being treated with the same methodologies uh we just have a lot more uh material remains
that point to the actual reality of alexander the great right right leading an army that kind of
thing just has a little more of an impact on well and and then and also like i mean it's it's just
really important that we that we remember that this kind of reaction like he has like oh but
you know this is so stupid nobody talks about that exam the great nobody talks about a vermin
empire but whatever like yes they do and there are conservatives in the field of history or
classics and all that kind of thing that really upset when revisionists come along and say hey
wait a minute how much do we really know about alexander the great or about homer or about the
roman empire and start revising history looking at the sources and and do the critical study of it
and so we we are doing those things and the problem is that when that happens people still
end up usually saying well okay sure yeah there was alexander the great like homer doesn't maybe
come out as well but you know it's questioning the roman empire there i'm like what what world
am i in that you could even like how do you what makes such a suggestion yeah it's not so and and
let's be clear what he's what he's pointed out so far right is that whoever wrote the gospels knew
some geography yeah like that's basically that's basically the argument right i i could look if i
have uh if i have a whole collection of uh daredevil comic books i can probably find hell's
kitchen you can use that as a map getting around your city right yeah you can you can say hey that's
from that daredevil comic book but that doesn't mean that dare that matt murdoch was an actual
superhero uh this but but he was i think right wasn't he pretty sure he was yeah and i know that
we need to get on to the question so i'm just gonna throw out there he also throws in that comment
about his key compares um the different the time distance between the passage of time between
jesus and the gospels to writing about uh world war two now or 50 years later as if there's any
kind of text like as if anything about that comparison makes sense right well and and it's
a really i i mean i love that um that because we have a case here in norway right like the
past few years where there has been someone who has gone back and looked at sources and and gone
through stuff and has been revising what um like the the way jews were treated in norway
during world war two and and we see that there is this really big change in thinking because for
the first you know generation generation and a half everybody was like of course we did everything
we could for the jews yeah and so that it was all this optimism about that of course and then
she went back and said ah well actually we knew quite a lot and people probably knew quite a lot
about what was going to happen and didn't do anything to prevent it yes and and so when you
read then rewriting the history of what those actions that were done were and the motivations
and suddenly history looks very very very different within 50 years and so there really
is that kind of thing where you can say oh we have we have first-hand evidence and like yeah
sure you have first-hand evidence you have artifacts you have facts but history is the
interpretation of those facts and this and there's a significant difference in terms of the
collection of data that this person had to work with from the middle of the 20th century versus
the way that information was passed and copied in you know 2000 years ago i mean you just look at
luke and that's within that's within a century um ostensibly of of jesus's birth and and entirely
flubs the relationship of the census that could not have taken place before six c e and harrod's
reign which could not have lasted beyond four b c e i mean just being you know however many years
off that may have been 60 70 years up to a century doesn't mean you have that is more accurate every
this is something i get all the time uh every occur everything needs to be interrogated on its
own terms on a on a case by case basis and and trying to use generalizations to overrule the
data to overrule the the individual idiosyncrasies of of a given uh claim i i think is is bad scholarship
yeah well i think no go ahead gen no god i was just gonna say i think we we should probably
we're we're not going to be able to watch uh through the rest of this because we should
probably get to some some super chats and questions so really quickly then since we're
going to do if you don't mind because one of the things he does he makes kind of a big deal of just
trying to just um ignore um discrepancies as because he has a need for the for scripture to
be in errant and he makes a big deal of scripture being in errant and i i really i you know i thought
i would plug this particular book of barts because of ermans because it does he goes through really
helpful examples yeah can you pull can you pull it up again gen there we go it he goes through
very helpful examples of of you know contradictions that that's just what they are right you have
you know eating the final dinner what is that final dinner jesus eats with his disciples and
it's and he just has a whole list of them and it's okay and you know evangelicals and
in errantists are not you know like can't handle that but let's just be honest about it and
hear a whole bunch of examples and then that just kind of helps you start to see things
differently i think because so yeah new word testament examples so does does anybody have
else have have concluding thoughts or things to say about about the video in in view of the
fact that we're not going to be able to get through it so i like i want i was gonna say i have one
thing that that uh that we didn't get to but but towards the end uh jeremiah brags about um you
know posting stuff from his his private his his private artifacts collection on on social media
and at one point claims to have a 1000 year old toro scroll which you know is not really believable
but also that's that's bad right right and it gets worse because he then brags about how
this 1000 year toro scroll was looted out of war torna rack yeah and hidden in a tire to get out of
yeah yeah like it's nuts um so and this i mean this this is this is a this is a sore spot with me
quite a bit guys like material culture uh archaeology it's it's not your it's not your sandbox it's
not your playpen it's not it's it's not the place that you go uh to get cool stuff
yeah that your friends don't have um i don't know like it yeah anyways anybody else yeah but
yeah no i but see i was gonna mention the same thing that i think like there was this there's
just such there's so much um authority grabbing that's going on here and the whole thing like
you i mean you you name this phylocemitism in the new testament but like all really he just
uses that as a ploy to be able to say the new testament is super perfect and everybody should
listen to me because i'm a doctor uh and i know things and i have things and like it's like this
appeal to the artifacts he's talked about these amazing digs that are so you know and so he does
all these kind of little weird like tricks to get you to believe everything and and then but
but especially those tourist scrolls really got me got me uh interested because they're they're
what they're only like they're only like five or six maybe like four i don't know four or five scrolls
from a thousand years ago like there's not a ton of stuff available and so
codex i mean the sassoon recently sold so i don't think that's the one right we have we have i mean
we have the aleppo codex i'm guessing he doesn't have the aleppo codex um you know like i mean i'm
not sure what he what he has but it's i mean like and i'll put this out there like if you
watch this dude show us we we're very interested in your thousand-year-old tourist role yeah it's
just embarrassing absolutely yeah like somebody should he should probably tell someone you should
show it yeah and and and tell the authorities because they might be interested right they probably
would uh it's it's uh it's like when i ask my um some of my friends and family the evidence for
flat earth because some of them are flat earthers and they can't give it to me i'm like please i
want to know tell me about this like i want to know for on a flat earth like give me the evidence
and they can't present it so yeah and i think that's a that's an important point to make i think
this is pretty standard apologetic argument by assertion where they they're not going to be
questioned on the overwhelming majority of things and the audience for whom they're performing
this conviction and this knowledge and this expertise isn't gonna care anyway and so they
can just say these things to the public they're going to achieve the rhetorical goals of saying
these things and folks like us are going to point out that this is riddled with with fallacy riddled
with with false claims riddled with attempts to try to to puff up their qualifications and all that
kind of stuff uh and they don't care because they they're performing for an audience and as long as
as they achieve the the rhetorical goals then they've done what they're they're there to do
and they don't care about the rest of it yeah i was looking at the notes really really quickly
and he you know he continues to go on to make a big deal of there not being any contradictions
and things like that and so i'm going to point out another book that i love um which is which is
the gospel parallels it was a i'm on it jen yep are you there we go thank you thank you um i got
to use it in my undergrad class and she had us highlight like where like each of the ideas
and traditions were different so we have like this is the synoptic gospel parallels so just
matthew mark and luke and you can see we had the color code based on like what they had in common
and what was unique to one or the other and and it just becomes a way of showing you that
there are it's you know they're just are things that they have in common there are ways that they
use the same story differently they have they add in they do this and they they end it differently
to a different point and it just seeing them side by side is actually really helpful for those of
you who are interested in that kind of thing who's the editor of that book this is throck morton
burton throck morton junior yeah like you can i believe that there's actually a free pdf of that
book online cool so you can color it when it's online that's very fun to have cray to have
colored pencils
sorry tonight i'm going to have bad dreams about not having colored pencils we
am i my old work i used to print off hundreds of pages of like scholarly work because i couldn't
afford the books that's a little secret i'll just let out the internet anyway we have a few questions
here our first first one i think this question is essentially um is there fluidity in the dead
sea scrolls because or in lxx because rabbi said the old testament is uncorrupted god's word
how wrong are they and that's from jesus lord thank you for the super chat
i i think i've actually seen this question on on some of my videos before already um it's a huge
topic uh and i think what he's what he's basically asking and what he's getting at something i
mentioned earlier in the stream was uh just the nature of the the texts the the the jewish text
that we now call scripture uh what this looked like at the time of the writing and the collection
of the dead sea scrolls um which presents our our best uh collection of evidence um yeah there's
there's a lot going on there there's representation of every text type that we
we have um and some that uh that that that looked quite different from from what we thought we had
and then this is you know dramatically uh affected by by the the fact that scholars classified
documents originally relative to uh the bible and in so doing lots of texts that you know are
are close to but but or or look similar to biblical texts but are quite different just
didn't even get treated as quote unquote bible for a very long time uh i don't know do you have
anything to say about that matt yeah i mean i think like my my thinking on this is just that we
have two different ways in which um things are are not um stable like there's the one that's
the canonical instability where we have we have literal differences in the kinds of texts that
we find collected together compared to what one would have expected if it was only the 66 canonical
books or whatever or even the the the larger canon or whatever like what we find in collections
is just widely different than what we would have thought but also that we have no two manuscripts
that are like and so there's just like even you talk about fluidity like on on some level
there's always something going on um but but that we do see true literary fluidity
among the Dead Sea Scrolls and especially when we looked at the comparisons with that with this
up to a gen so so like we like we like i don't think any more scholars at least scholars of the
Dead Sea Scrolls have now basically moved to a new way of thinking that we're the fluidity is the
rule as well and and what we're doing is trying to question then what what does that mean for
for how we understand the literature of the time so it's like corruption isn't anymore how we talk
about what was going on but we just talk about fluidity and and textual pluriformity and that's
just that's just what we have yeah but thank you for the question no go ahead then i would just
suggest that i'm i and i hope to pursue this more in the future but i i don't think you have a
developing concern for freezing the shape of the text the the notion that the locus of authority
is the text itself i think doesn't begin to take over until like around the second century c e and
so prior to that the message is the most important part the text is just a manifestation of that
message and so the the authority is not in the text and so it's not as important that the text
exactly match as long as as the message is uh is gotten across and so i i think you see a kind of
taking over of the inviolability of the text rather than the message around uh second century c e and
i think you see this in uh the hebrew bible as well as with the new testament where we're
moving towards the locus of authority settling on the text itself and that's why there's a move
towards standardization in that time period and away from fluidity and we're just looking back on
the fluidity part through the lenses of the text is the locus of authority because that's how we've
always thought about it yep exactly and let's talk about the project sometime was that sorry just i
just as a as an aside here that the self in the side chat if you could stop uh proselytizing
that would be great thank you that'd be great i was gonna say some some rude stuff but i'll
i'll leave that for my own channel uh archival blob uh thank you all for your work you make the
bible really interesting um thank you for the super chat uh what happened to the old logo
the eyeball because it's a cool new one by the way so um i'm i'm i'm we're testing this out uh i
have a uh i have a uh uh we have a fan who uh was so excited about the show that he he took it upon
himself to uh uh he's he's in he's in in marketing and he took it upon himself to uh to design uh
a new logo for us i think it looks pretty cool and it's uh uh it's it's very it's well within the
spirit of the show the the the logo itself is uh is is is designed from from diacritics which is
super cool but uh but yeah i see the comment near the beginning someone commenting on the angry
oh oh yes i saw that
does it represent new life or something like let's find some biblical meaning
well you know it's all everything for the person is right there in the it's all about the
or this yeah yeah exactly uh thank you for the tender super chat dan in a live chat you
talked about tom holland's book and how it misrepresents scholarship on enlightenment and
renaissance uh lit can you recommend these apologists are constantly citing this book
i don't remember exactly what i said about misrepresenting scholarship on enlightenment
and renaissance i i mentioned that a lot of people are citing holland uh to the effect that
like the bible or christianity is responsible for uh for all of these good things the development
of the idea of natural rights and all of this stuff and i think my point was that
when you look at the the scholarship on enlightenment and renaissance and reformation
the the bible is certainly not the driving force behind it in fact a lot of the
enlightenment rationalism that is developing is actually challenging uh biblical perspectives
and the the inspiration and the revelation in the bible um oh gosh there there are a
handful of of texts that i think do a really good job of talking about this and the enlightenment
and the renaissance but and i talk about it a little bit in in my dissertation or at least
a chapter that i cut out of my dissertation but i i don't think i could name them off the
top of my head but i think my main point was just that this notion that that christianity
or the bible was a driving force behind the development of of the renaissance and enlightenment
rationalism is not how scholars talk about either uh that and and i yeah i've got holland's book
i've read bits and pieces of it i haven't read enough of it to be able to um to say exactly what
holland's getting at and where i think he's wrong but in terms of how holland's is is leveraged by
apologists um if that if they're accurately representing his argument then then it's an
awful argument but i'll have to i'll have to re or finish reading holland's book before i can say
anything about his argument in particular because the bible and and christianity are not what are
driving the development of of natural rights and and enlightenment rationalism and they're
participating sure but not the driving forces thank you that was from viscount julian uh
next one from linda peterson just want to say thanks for everything you all of you do
thank you supreme scientists genesis 1513 prophecy for us slavery i was told this i can't
know that's for josh surely surely you covered genesis 1513 in your
this is your your your your children so shall be slaves in a foreign land isn't it i mean i'm
unsurprised that supreme scientists just heard that know this for certain that your offspring
shall be aliens in the land that is not theirs and shall be slaves there and they shall be
oppressed for 400 years i mean i guess it seems like there's a proximate target of that
prophecy i'm trying to how do we say this how do we say this kip depending on one's interpretive
model that could be a prophecy is that fair i once had i once had had someone tell me that
aliens could exist because i think it was jesus or someone said i have another flock of sheep in
a faraway land and it's like so maybe that's yeah yeah so i mean i i i wondered that when i was a
teenager too yeah well that's how that's a lot of insurance rationalize right yes the jewish folks in
the americas right uh as sure as that's an olive branch the the laughing philosopher thank you
is this uh an analogy useful jesus indian guru paul indian american popularizer
gospel implicit context usa gospel explicit reference indian okay i need some help
yeah i i need to i need to take some time with that yeah i yeah indian is too handy and i know
people reference saying you've spent some time in india before he did this thing but i i think
it's just an analogy yeah it's just to say like if we consider g's like about the authenticity
or the claims being made that that um that you have kind of you might have an authentic guru but
then you might have this paul being the popularizer trying to make americans like the indian stuff and
then the the gospels are written for the for the american context not for the indian context but the
references are still oh thank you that was a helpful explanation but i still say that philosophy
i've studied you know okay i whatever helps you whatever helps you make sense of it that's i
i can under i understand the logic and what we're doing but i'm not sure it's like well i fundamentally
read it differently i read the newer testament and the development of early christianity differently
and i might you know you all might not agree with me on that but i think of what paul did is
just radically different from and actually ignore i mean i have i talk about this all the time on my
live streams i mean he actively ignores what jesus stood for and did that got him killed
and just focuses on the death and makes that salvific so like they're not even they're not
even on the same page you know so and he creates something significant um so maybe on that level
indian american populizer and it blows up here perhaps but i i yeah he's not even
anyway i still remember when uh dr francesca stablaka pool who was on the talk show
someone asked what parts of the bubble do you remove and she said paul and i was like oh
because it's it's she's like he's just so down on humanity and i was like that's pretty that's pretty
accurate uh discovering ancient history sorry if i may jump in yeah david before you get to the other
one i do i feel bad about not being able to um to give sources for that previous question
from that generous super chat so i did just pull up a handful of books that i know that i referenced
in my dissertation that i think probably you're gonna find discussion that's going to be relevant
in these books uh one is uh s j barnett the enlightenment and religion the myths of modernity
which i think uh will be a great discussion uh wane hudson from 2009 enlightenment and modernity
the english deists and reform uh harrison's book religion and the religions in the english
enlightenment is uh there's a good discussion god indian enlightenment is an edited volume by
william bullman and robert ingram that has a number of discussions that are going to be relevant
toleration in enlightenment europe by grell and porter is another one that's going to be great
and then i think this is a just a great book all around and and is relevant to some degree
william cavanaugh's book the myth of religious violence uh talks at at some length about those
periods as well so there's going to be stuff in there that's relevant to how religion and
enlightenment rationalism are are interacting with each other that i think will will help contextualize
the discussion a little better so sorry for interrupting us great uh discovering ancient
history of alonja doctor joshua bowman the doctor of slavery he'll cure you of your slavery
i just i just don't know why josh is so obsessed with slavery that's
i'm bound by it in some way so so we do so they're all the superchats before we kind of
off but there are a few that we could probably still get to so i'm just going to before we have
to wrap up but so i'm this is the next one boring turtle tenders do you think the people of the era
had a notion of suspension of disbelief that seems like a core part of verus militia and i suspect
it's anachristic anachronism is my gosh so i i think there's some of this like i think
the idea of suspension of disbelief is starting to to creep into some of the early
early earnest attempts at writing histories right um you know one of the things that the
herodotus does is start to develop models of analyzing source material in an effort to
to to to make determinations right about what we can believe in not um i don't know
it's an interesting question though
it is i think i think that part of me wants to say with no no sources or this is not coming
from discussions i just want to suggest though that if we do then they probably did too
i mean to a certain level but i you know because they're humans just like we are they were humans
you know like there's a part of um just because we have access to more resources and ways of
in texts and things like that which is what we focus on here we have more of those but
but i think it's um i want to be careful about talking about ancient people as if they weren't
as intelligent or aware in this you know in the ways that we can point to because we have
things that talk about it more clearly i don't know if i'm making sense i just
anyway i'll just stop talking there's a possibility let's just say i mean there's a possibility
we have a great comment from mjr schneider you previously argued that there was no
extra biblical sources for jesus not derived from the traditional from tradition about his
resurrection why would jocephus's account of james the brother of jesus not count
i think is i think that one's for dan right uh it it seems like it probably is uh
previously there's no extra biblical source for jesus not derived from the tradition about his
as resurrection um so jocephus is talking about james and just says uh who's the brother of jesus
who was called christ and that's not really much that's not much information beyond just
that these two men had a relationship but i don't recall when exactly when i said there was no
biblical source not derived from the tradition about his resurrection
but if i said something like that then this would would be a source for at least knowledge of
his existence but i do think that the tradition about jesus's resurrection is also
there jocephus is not saying this in the absence of a tradition about jesus's resurrection jocephus
saying something about james and then bringing in information about jesus based on the tradition
that spread about his resurrection i don't think he would have said anything at all if he had no
knowledge of a tradition about a resurrected christ but importantly unless you're unless
you're gary havermass you also can't marshal jesus had a brother named james and jocephus knew about
this into jesus rose from the dead i think that's right right you just gotta have faith kip uh
constellation takes this uh what is a demon in judyism can't really find a concrete answer
judyism seems to be an incomplete religion an incomplete religion i don't like that last part
but that's an interesting question to stop yeah um
i i think you don't really in the hebrew bible you don't really have a word for demon the closest
you get is deuteronomy 32 17 which just refers to shadeem which is probably just a category of
regular old deity uh you have for instance in the um uh the dirala inscription a reference to the
shadein which is an aramaic ish plural of probably a related word uh and so it's probably between
the persian period and the greco roman period that there's the influence of these concepts of
malevolent divine forces you have them in mesopotamia you have them in egypt you have them in elsewhere
where you know they get in through your ear and and menstruating women are particularly susceptible
to uh to demonic although they don't use mean we would translate only while we're menstruating
okay it's when the the um the boundaries are the thinnest and so when uh women are particularly
susceptible um and but yeah i don't think it gets picked up in judyism and in the greco roman period
and yeah probably some influence from zoroastrianism but yeah then christianity just runs wild with it
and i just want to also follow up on that to saying that that makes judyism incomplete it's
like really having demons makes a religion complete isn't is not a claim i would agree with
i i think that represents a pretty evolutionist view that's what we have now is complete and
full and right and anything before is a particular strand even right because buddhism has no concept
of um demons or angels really so yeah it's interesting because every religion sets their own
requirements so like islam will say we're the only religion that does x and then christians will say
we're the only religion where god came down to us and then you know like it's like you're setting
the standard and then saying where we meet that standard uh solving problems of their own creation
right yes right okay well there's uh there's a scholar named brent nong brie who's uh who
does a lot with new testament textual criticism where my colleague your colleague wrote a wrote
a great book called before religion which shares one of uh a a strong consensus view that actually
the william cavanaugh book i referenced also argues for which is basically that the concept of
religion as we understand it today is primarily a production of the renaissance reformation and
enlightenment and there's an argument to make for medieval islam also developing a very similar
concept with their word din but um and what what nong brie says is that religion today is anything
that sufficiently resembles protestant christianity and so the lens that we tend to look through when
we're thinking and talking about religion is what protestant christianity says religion is which is
basically protestant christianity says we're the the pinnacle of religion everybody else's
they're just uh wannabes and so that's that this seems like a manifestation of that's
presupposition of a protestant christian view of what religion is supposed to be
i mean there are reasons when you look at a world religion textbook for instance like people have
conversations about what makes a thing of religion in general and there will be lots of different lists
of descriptors or or elements of a of a tradition that well this is and this isn't does that mean
make it a religion or not and and they're the fact that there are various lists to begin with
that um tells you something and and the fact that you'll at the end of the day they'll say but you
know if it's like more than half of these we'll call it a religion and that's you know and call
today like you know there's a maybe you know this guy too kokovan stook rad does that ring a bell
nomad not another colleague okay so he has a wonderful paper about the discursive study
of religion and this is something that i've shared many times and it always freaks people out when i
say it but the only there's only one necessary insufficient feature that is found in every last
thing that is labeled religion and only in those things that are labeled religion and that is that
they have been labeled religion and so i was like what this is just this is an actual fact
there is no other feature you can point to that is possessed by everything that is labeled religion
and only those things and so kokovan stook rad's argument is that for a discursive approach to the
study of religion we need to understand religion as societal arrangement of knowledge about religion
in other words that religion is whatever a group decides is a religion and yep that's the end of
the discussions yep so is diavolo critics of religion yes i can clearly want it to be whatever
you want it to be okay so uh my uh jenny and joe nox thanks for the tunnel super chat my husband
and i geek out to you all thank you and we'll end on this last question thanks jenny and joe
yeah that was very nice as a classicist i think that even philologists living in the printing
press era tend to underestimate the textual fluidity of ancient texts no question we agree
yes yes so that's um i think it's it's nice to hear a classicist say that because uh right
um it's i don't know it's i think in the in the in the sometimes i don't know sometimes we uh
who play in the like new philology side of things tend to like straw man the classicists and say that
they kind of are you know stuck on the old philological paradigms and don't like fluidity
and stuff like that but so thank you rebello 178 it's uh it's good to hear your your your comforting
words yes and if and if you haven't seen it before go check out the video i am the very model of a
biblical philologist yeah yes but do you not know that one no i don't oh well that is i will look at
it so great so um we have we have uh with the remaining time one of the things that
that we've committed to doing is is talking a little bit about current work uh new work
that we're we're looking forward to stuff that um stuff that we're doing um in the in in the actual
the real world of scholarship i don't know if we should call it that so um yeah maybe why don't
you uh why don't you start matt tell us what's uh what's going on at mf yeah in our way yeah no it's
good so um yeah last month we had lauren stuck and brook uh at mf he was here working on his uh
his edition of ethiopic inoc and i just kind of was over here uh kind of not because we have
resources to give him but because uh a few of us know him and uh and he was able to find a quiet
place to to work at mf so i had a a good time having sharing meals and and nerding out with him
while he was there it was here so it was great um and yeah i'm uh i'm working on two two books at
the moment so i'm just i sent off a couple chapters of my book on script sacred scripture
for our for our bachelor program that's written in norwegian that we're working on um and uh i have
now a kind of an agreement with gorgias press to uh publish my book of syriac biblical riddles
which i'm sure will be a a bestseller um when it when it does come out so um yeah this uh working
yeah writing a lot these days so yeah nice nice uh dan what's going on
nothing what's going on with you i am uh i'm gearing up for a conference that's going to be
taking place at brown university this next month isn't it of of um may uh it's called the the
meanings and ends of religion religion oh god of monotheism but it is inspired by uh william
cantwell smith's book the meaning and end of religion and we're going to talk a bit about why
monotheism is not an analytically useful framework for looking at the bible and we've got i think
we have ten scholars ten ish scholars who are going to be speaking uh looking forward to that
i just have to finish my paper um and then i was i was going to say i think i saw david bernett in
the in the chat today um yeah i i i got a message from him a couple uh texts from him uh while we
were chatting yeah he's uh he's i he and i are organizing it with uh some other friends including
sol olian uh and uh yeah it's gonna be a great time and there will be a publication coming out of the
other side of that and then i've got two other books that i've got to finish before the end of
this month one's a trade volume so uh it's supposed to be coming out uh early next april so um we're
all like prepared to be very annoyed by me um once i have a cover uh might as well just mute me
because uh i'm gonna be intolerable so fun fact sol olian was the first ever uh scholar that i had
sent an email to what were you asking him or saying what was he actually did he actually did work on
a Dead Sea Scrolls fragment while he was a student at harvard and i was working on it for uh for my
ma thesis so but uh yeah but i it literally it took me like two days of breathing into a paper bag
typing out 16 giraffes of the email before yeah and uh joceia bissby is the other uh person who's
helping us with it and he's a phd student uh with sol at at brown right now so i'm looking very much
forward to uh being in providence i've never been there before nice cool jen what's up um i'm working
on the audio for marriage in the bible what do the tech say recording that finally trying to get
that out in the next month if i can and um doing a couple pieces on the same for bible and interpretation
a website that's meant for a lot of people who are watching this um for general audience who's
interested in kind of the kinds of things conversations we're having so it was nice
to be asked to do that um and i already mentioned the the podcast the official like we actually
pay people to do tech nice technical work on our podcast not just a youtube live stream or whatever
wild olive game changing conversation about literature culture in the bible yeah that's awesome
yeah i think every so um everybody will will uh share links and we can we can post links to all
this stuff in the in the descriptions oh there we go that's cool i can i can bring that up so everyone
sees it too i'm kidding there we go do it okay thank you yep that's awesome
um so all right josh hey doing what's new yeah so i am writing a book currently homosexuality
in the bible a fair and balanced approach uh which is going to take into account all the
engineers to material which hopefully will be good um i am also uh going to be teaching learn
biblical hebrew uh which kip i probably should have told you about before i said this starting
in either may or june but i think the class will start in june it's a 10 week course sort of going
three semesters uh we're going to be using chillman let's say i'll spoke but uh yeah um
so more to more to come here in the next week or so on that i'm we will definitely talk about
that's exciting that's cool in the thursday readings groups yeah sure that's awesome good
all right so um i'm just uh i'm i'm still plugging away at uh at my book i have crested the the
midway point that's for sure i just finished a chapter on uh on family relationships dynamics
property and uh and and jennifer's wonderful book on biblical marriage which is very badly
overexposed in my camera uh was extremely helpful uh for that so thanks jen i appreciated that um yeah
uh dav what what are what do you do in these days well i'm studying ancient no i'm not doing
anything important i we have i say that and then i say this dr kip's coming on deep drinks tomorrow
so everyone should go over there and watch that uh this can be awesome we're gonna be talking about
real i'm so glad you said that because i totally forgot it might be tomorrow but it'll be sometime
with the next episode we'll discuss this after um kip but but yeah that's what we're doing i have
deep conversations over a drink of the guest choice and we've been a bit sparse lately because we've
been working on a um a couple of cool short videos and i've been incredibly busy with work but
things will be picking up soon and it's going to be awesome excellent that's great so um
we're gonna finish on time i think so i think the first time ever we're we're going to finish on
time uh everybody who who sent super chats that we were unable to get to those i'm i'm sorry uh
about that we have uh we have determined from from here on forward that we're really gonna try to
stick to this this two hour limit so uh i hope that you continue to uh to to bear with us as
