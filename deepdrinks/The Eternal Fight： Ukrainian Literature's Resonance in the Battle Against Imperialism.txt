When I read some Ukrainian literature right now,
for example, our famous poets and authors,
and I read the words, they say, are still on the money today.
You read a person's feelings, like in thoughts,
from centuries ago, and they resonate,
like, if it was written today, because exactly for that reason,
because it is the same fight.
Those people, a lot of them, our famous authors,
were executed by Russians, Russian imperialists stayed, I mean,
so they were thought they were imprisoned.
A lot of our famous writers spent their entire life in prison.
