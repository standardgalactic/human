It just so happens, even today, as advanced as we like to think we are,
no matter who they are, someone might go,
I'm being dealt a horrible hand in life right now.
Well, they might go speak to a shaman in South America.
They might go and talk to some palm reader,
or they might actually go to church and ask God, what is it?
Like, I think that the human has always tried to get to the unknown
and the much bigger than them and not understanding what this is
and kind of the God of the gaps idea,
and trying to seek out something there.
People aren't going to ask, where do you go when you die?
Because humans naturally, when they die,
one of the most common things is they hear or experience their loved one
and they've been gone for years or months.
