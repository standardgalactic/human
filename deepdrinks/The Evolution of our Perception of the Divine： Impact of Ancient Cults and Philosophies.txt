What I mean is, is we're dealing with a God in the Bronze Age.
And this God in the Bronze Age is just so happens
to be in the same region of the world
that God's in Egypt, that God's in Ugarit,
that God's in Mesopotamia, that God's all around here.
Walk, talk, have sex, have kids, create with sex,
all this stuff.
We have to admit that's a later idea.
Thanks to Plato and those within the Greek world
impacting it.
And so now we have a different perception of God
and Stoicism and Platonism in Christianity
and the different various pagan cults and whatnot
and philosophies that were going on ended up shaping
the idea of God that we eventually knell down.
And that's just the honest truth.
If they wanna say, in some way I can imagine
a sophisticated theist going,
our perception of the divine has also evolved over time.
It's just, you'd have to have a very loose
interpretive model about God.
And like.
