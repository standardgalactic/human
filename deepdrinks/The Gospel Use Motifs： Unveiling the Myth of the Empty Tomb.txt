Like we can't forget the Gospels are literary like no matter what their literature and what I mean by this is they're telling a story
It's basically an ancient biography
It doesn't take all the boxes of ancient biography, but it ticks like born and dies most of the time
And so I think we have to really keep that in mind
Because something like the empty tomb is a motif and it's a motif that existed before the New Testament or the Gospels
It's a motif that you see persist
