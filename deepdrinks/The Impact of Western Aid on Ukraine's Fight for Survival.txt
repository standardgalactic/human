But we know at the same time that our successes highly depend on the supply of weapons and aid from the West.
So people know that, of course, they're slightly terrified that you guys will abandon us and not give us any more aid.
And we will have to fight with everything we have now, and we will continue.
I would like to point out that even if you stop giving us anything right now, we will still continue the fight.
This will be much bloodier, even more civilians in Ukraine will lose their lives.
This will be like a partisan war, maybe, or whatever it is else.
But not a single person, I talk to many soldiers, to many people, like I volunteer, I know, I also saw statistics of people's opinions in Ukraine.
And pretty much 90% of them will not say we should not back down at any circumstances, even after a fucking nuclear strike.
