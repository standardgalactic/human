So this is a major issue in the first century.
Every coin is stamped with an image of Judea capta.
They build the call, what we call the Colosseum
in celebration of the destruction of that temple,
not war on Judea.
Everybody's curious about these things.
So when you have a biography emerge of a Judean,
Jewish, holy man who's teaching the Jewish scriptures,
everyone's kind of interested in that,
walking around the Galilee,
everybody's interested in that territory,
infused with some of the other aspects
that we know are popular.
And the general Greco-Roman pantheon of the time
or imagination of the time he's the son of a God,
he's a miracle worker like Asclepius,
he's the son of a God like Alexander,
or Octavian Augustus, who's the emperor when Jesus is born,
calls himself the son of a God, calls himself a savior,
refers to his Pax Romana as a gossip.
There's actually very little within early Christianity
that you can't find in the broader Greco-Roman world.
