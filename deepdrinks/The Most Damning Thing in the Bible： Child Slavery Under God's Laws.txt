I actually think it's the most damning thing in the entire Bible that a child can be born
into slavery in the Israelite tradition under God's laws period.
You know, that's the workaround is if you had an Israelite indentured servant who you
could beat and do all these horrible things too as long as they didn't lose a tooth or
lose an arm or whatever the rules were.
If you wanted them to stay longer, you know, the workaround was, hey, get them married.
And if they have a kid and or a spouse, they are now permanent indentured servants.
