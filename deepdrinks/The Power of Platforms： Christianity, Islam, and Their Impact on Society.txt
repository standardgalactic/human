If I'm not to platform a Nazi, like Nazis are doing,
they've got no power in the real world.
Christians and the ideology behind Christianity
and the ideology behind Islam are causing incredible harm
to like a vast majority of people, all of Uganda, all women.
You know, so it's like, at what stage do we, it's like,
you know, is it just because they're so popular?
If Christianity was like a fringe group,
would it now no longer be appropriate to platform them?
Or is it because it's so popular that it's okay?
That's my question of where clearly the line is somewhere.
I'm not.
