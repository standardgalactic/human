There's a saying I learned in graduate school
that has all kinds of application
is that map is not territory.
And what that means is that when we look at a map,
we're not looking at the territory itself.
We're looking at a reconstruction of that territory
that serves certain purposes and omits most of the information
and only includes what is considered relevant
in order for that map to serve its function.
And that's true of words and their relationship
to the ideas in our minds.
That's true of conceptual frameworks we develop.
It's true of science.
The map is not the territory in science either.
