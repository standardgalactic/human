The anti-trans movement right now is louder than it's ever been.
It's larger than it's ever been, even though there are more accepting people,
because in the past it was more neutral people, or people who just didn't know or didn't care or whatever.
You can definitely argue that the past was worse for trans people,
because trans people felt more like they had to be in the closet in the past.
Whereas now, the opposition is worse than ever, even as the acceptance is louder than ever too.
