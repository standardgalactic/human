Fox Parham was a renegade Methodist preacher. He was kicked out of the church. He was very
focused on the Holy Spirit and on healing and he went on to form his own healing home called
called Bethlehem healing home. So he and a small group of followers had an all night vigil on New
Eve of 1901 and they were praying. They believed you know what was written in the Bible that if
they just stayed up and fasted and prayed that the Holy Spirit would come in their congregation
and eventually that night it did. He came to a woman called Agnes Osmond and eventually over the next
few days the Holy Spirit descended I think on most of the congregation including Parham himself
and you know he was absolutely thrilled by this discovery but he did continue to get a small
following. He was a pretty compelling character if not a particularly nice one.
