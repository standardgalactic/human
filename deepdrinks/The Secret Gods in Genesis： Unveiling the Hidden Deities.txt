have in Genesis 3 the serpent tells Eve, you're not going to die, you're going to be like the gods
knowing good and evil. That's verse 5. In verse 22 God says, oh, the human became like one of us,
basically confirming that the serpent was 100% correct back in verse 5. So who are the one of
us? Sounds like it's the gods. Then you have in Genesis 6, the Bene Elohim, the children of God
went down and took wives from the daughters of humanity. And you have in Genesis 11,
God again sees they're building a tower and says, let us go down. And so just in
the primeval history, Genesis 1 through 11, you have a bunch of very explicit references to multiple
gods.
