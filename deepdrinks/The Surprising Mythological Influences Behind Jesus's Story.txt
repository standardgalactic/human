Those are the major three in the Greek and Roman world. And of course, in the Jewish world, you had Moses, Elijah, Jonah. These figures were huge and they would imitate them using some of that Alexander the Great, Romulus and Heracles mythology and incorporate and others as Scalepius with the healing Dionysus with the turning water and the wine.
This is clearly a trope. But Jesus and it's real.
