And we have that in Deuteronomy 32.
In the Bible, we have El-Yan, the most high,
when he apportioned the nations, dividing them up,
pretty much giving a deity, one of his sons,
rulership over the 70 nations, one for each,
he gave Israel as an inheritance to Yahweh.
So Yahweh was one of the lesser gods
who received this people called Israel.
And that is spelled out in Deuteronomy.
It's without a doubt.
And it's polytheistic.
No matter what Michael Heiser and them want to try
and tell you that it's not, yes,
all of these deities play a role,
and it just shows how polytheistic it was.
There's several people who've written tons on this,
but it eventually moves toward something
like a henotheistic worldview.
