Can we say that Jesus existed?
Is that something that we can say historically?
I think he did.
And I know this is a, it's a really at
minimum a good thought experiment,
but it's a really interesting question.
Because I think what shocks people sometimes is
once you start to find out how relatively thin
the evidence actually is for this person.
Because, you know, we don't have anything written down
by the disciples themselves.
You know, the Gospels are much, much later.
Paul never actually knew the historical Jesus.
But I think we can know that he was there for a few reasons.
