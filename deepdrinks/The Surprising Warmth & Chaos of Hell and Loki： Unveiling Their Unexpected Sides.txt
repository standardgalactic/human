So hell, in one saga is referenced as a demonic queen.
In Greta's saga, she is Loki's evil daughter, right?
But when looking at her,
as far as like from a practitioner standpoint,
and looking at other stories of her,
including Snorri's story of her
in which she is a aggressively protective caretaker
of the dead,
there is another like warmer maternal image
that comes from like worshiping her.
And that practitioners that include hell
within their practice near universally state
that there is a warmer presence there
than what is often described.
