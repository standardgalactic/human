Most of us who work on the scrolls are convinced that the Thanksgiving hymns they're called
are composed partially if not all by the teacher, but the core may be like a dozen or so absolutely

That is, well, I'm definitely going to be there with bells on as soon as I can.
That is very exciting. Guys, if you want to sign up for this course, the links in the description,
it's the first link at the top of the description. Join me, I'll be there and I'll be there in the
hangout. So it'd be awesome to see the community take part in this because this is incredible
stuff. This is not a course you want to miss out on.
