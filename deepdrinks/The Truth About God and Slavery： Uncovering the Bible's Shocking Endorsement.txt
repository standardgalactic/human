The final thing I remember was I really, really, really, really tried to get a final answer
on the slavery issue.
And it's not like I'm a one-issue de-converter.
It wasn't like, oh, I can't excuse slavery, and therefore God's not real.
No, he could just be a God I disagree with, or there could be something I don't understand.
But on top of everything else, with everything else I already had an issue with and could
not explain, as soon as it became abundantly clear to me, and this is a hill I would die
on, that 100% the God of the Bible condones and endorses chattel slavery.
I see no way around it.
