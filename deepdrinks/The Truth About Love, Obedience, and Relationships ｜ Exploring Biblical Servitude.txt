We're commanded to love God, which is to obey Him.
That's how Jesus describes what loving Him means, to obey me.
So, you know, we have the same slave-servant mentality,
even as Christians with Jesus.
We're commanded to love Him, and that looks like servitude.
And professing your love for your master
so that you can stay with your wife and kid is such.
It's on to death as well.
Yeah, it's like the most abusive thing,
like, hey, bow down and kiss my feet if you want to keep your wife.
And you know, look, you wanted this.
You love me.
