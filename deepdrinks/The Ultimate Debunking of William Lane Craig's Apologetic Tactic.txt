If you're going to make the argument that it had to come from something, then so does
God.
Well, not God.
He's outside of that.
Why?
And there is no why, except that you want him to be the first cause, because that answers
your weird, creepy little apologetic tactic.
And it simply doesn't work.
I think they get the most attention because you can dress them up like the, you know,
William Lane Craig's cologne is, it's simple with its premises, but when you actually hear
him explain it, he's using so many philosophical terms and really impressive language that
you feel like, how do I, how do I fight this?
How can I break this down?
But all he is saying is my God is the one exception.
And it's like, that's not an answer that doesn't answer anything.
