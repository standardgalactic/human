always interest me when I was back in church that the Bible says, you know, those who talk to the
dead or those who try and talk to the dead or or like it's they forbid talking to the dead
as if you can actually talk to the dead. And like the or, you know, I shall have no other gods
before me, not not idols or not like statues of things that aren't real, but gods. The Bible
seems to argue, at least in the early in the early scriptures, that other gods actually do exist.
Right.
