There are a bunch of ways that our society has developed
what are actually just rituals that are intended to signal
to others that they belong, shaking hands,
smiling at somebody you walk by,
not muttering to yourself as you're walking down the street.
There are a bunch of different things that we do
basically to signal to the rest of the people around us,
I'm one of the good ones.
I can be trusted, I belong.
And so ritual extends well beyond what we label religion.
It is a part of what helps societies stay together.
