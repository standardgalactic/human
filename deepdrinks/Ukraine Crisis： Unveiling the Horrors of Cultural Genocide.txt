We cannot surrender to it because what we're surrendering to is annihilation of our at least cultural genocide.
But as far as Bucha and Irpin and Hastomel and Dizum and Mariupol shows and all the other areas,
we will liberate and found new mass graves there.
I have no doubt about that, new torture chambers.
And we will discover that because this is what they're doing.
And I don't understand how people can pretend they care about Ukraine and say,
just surrender to someone whose whole idea and they do not hide it.
They say it out loud on their TV is to eradicate you as people.
