But according to Paul, he saw Peter and James in Jerusalem.
So James, Jesus's brother, Peter, we all know Peter, the rock of
the church, et cetera.
So one of his followers.
And, you know, if you were going to say somebody, the word is
interpolation, fake that part of Paul's letter that he's in
contact with these guys and they're having what's called the
Jerusalem Council where they basically, I mean, on my reading,
James and Peter are like, this Paul guy, you weren't even
there. Like, you don't know what you're talking about.
This is a Jewish movement.
Go be a apostle to the Gentile, whatever you want to do, like
we're staying here and continuing what we were doing.
Um, later, the later church goes to great strides to try to
resolve what was that seeming historical conflict between
these, these Paul and Peter and James, for example, uh, you
didn't need to create that conflict to then have to resolve
it. Do you know what I mean?
