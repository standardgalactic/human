When we look at how they thought about sexuality
and how they thought about same-sex intercourse,
anciently, their understandings of the way
the human body works and sexuality works,
their understanding of why this may be good,
bad or indifferent, their understanding
of the effects of these things wildly,
wildly outdated, irrelevant to today.
