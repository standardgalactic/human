How would you answer someone who says, that's all great, Ocean, but it's unfalsifiable.
How do we falsify anything of what you're saying?
I've opted to kind of be like, because a lot of people hate solvers and conversations,
I tend to move towards idealism instead, in which, yes, there's an external world and
what is being engaged with is external to you.
But it's the content to it is more of mind rather than of physicality.
And something that can get very headache inducing is saying, well, physicality in and
of itself is also unfalsifiable at the end of the day.
There's a lot of pretzels of justification that a lot of these ideas are belt upon.
