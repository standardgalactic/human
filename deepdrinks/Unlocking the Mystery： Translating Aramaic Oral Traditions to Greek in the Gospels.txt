wrote this down on my notes.
Another problem I have with this whole focus
on the reliability of oral traditions is language.
We can detect some of the traditions
tracing back to Jesus or the first Christians
on the basis of surviving armingisms,
but the Gospels themselves were composed in Greek
by sophisticated and fluid Greek speakers.
What happens to Aramaic oral traditions
that become translated, right?
This is kind of the point that I'm getting at
that you're going to see,
they would have a much stronger aramaic flavor
to them if they were taken whole cloth
from eyewitnesses through interviews
conducted in aramaic.
