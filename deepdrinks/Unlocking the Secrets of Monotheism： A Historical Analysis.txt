I gave a paper at last year's annual meeting
of the Society of Biblical Literature
where I argued that you don't have monotheism
until you have, well, the term is invented
in the 17th century by Henry Moore.
And it is a very specific philosophical ideological package
that Moore is referring to.
But this package is really how Moore describes us
as opposed to them, us good, them bad.
And so I would argue that monotheism
has always been an identity marker,
a way to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys.
