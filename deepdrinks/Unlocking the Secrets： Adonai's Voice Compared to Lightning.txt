places that are named, and they are all places that are not in Israel, but are further north in
Syria, which is Baal's territory. And so a bunch of scholars thought, hmm, it sounds an awful lot
like this is other literature that probably originally was dedicated to Baal and then was
taken over by Adonai. And it may have been as simple as just trading out the names,
or they may have doctored it up a little bit more, but they left the place names that are
all places that are further north where Baal has sovereignty.
