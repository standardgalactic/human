What I would say is maybe reconciliation
shouldn't be the goal.
Maybe the goal should just be to learn from this
and figure out a way to make yourself a better person.
Whether that means abandoning that map
or whether that means just recognizing this is just a map
but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not useful to me
or it does not bring meaning into my life.
I think since the Enlightenment,
since the Reformation and the Enlightenment,
a lot of people have begun convinced
that religion is entirely about truth claims
and a lot of people think of it that way
and that's another situation where the map is not territory.
The cognitive science of religion,
I think makes a pretty strong case that for most people,
most religion is about a sense of meaning,
a sense of community, finding purpose
and a bunch of stuff in addition to what the truth claims are.
