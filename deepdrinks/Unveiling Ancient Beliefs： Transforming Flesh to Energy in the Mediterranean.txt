You see discourse across the ancient Mediterranean,
again, not exclusive to Paul or Pharisees,
but anybody who's engaged in ancient physics,
which at the time was really controlled by stoicism
or informed by stoicism,
talking about this idea of being able to transform
from flesh to a spiritual flesh,
a pneumatic flesh is the term.
So could someone resurrect into a pneumatic form?
Yes.
