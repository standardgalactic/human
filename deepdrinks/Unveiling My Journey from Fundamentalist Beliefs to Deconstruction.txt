you know, growing up in fundamentalist churches,
you see all kinds of things that reinforce this belief.
But man, probably at the end of the day,
my excuse that I fell back on was,
okay, if there's issues with all of this,
it doesn't change the fact that I know this guy, Jesus,
as well as I thought I knew like my best friend or my mom.
It was just that foundational.
