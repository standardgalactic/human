First Timothy wasn't written by Paul,
it was just somebody who was mimicking Paul,
but it's there as well.
We have an entirely different idea of human sexuality
that is more influenced by Greco-Roman social mores
and philosophical thought.
And there are these hierarchies of domination
and penetration that were active anciently
and were a little more systematic
in the Greco-Roman period.
And so we do now have a condemnation
in Romans 1, 26 of female same-sex intercourse.
But Paul's sexual ethic is even weirder
than the one we find in Leviticus,
because Paul is a dogmatically celibate man
who thinks that Jesus is coming back too quickly
for anybody to worry about like procreation.
He doesn't care about procreation.
Everybody should just be celibate
and you should only get married if you can't hack celibacy.
