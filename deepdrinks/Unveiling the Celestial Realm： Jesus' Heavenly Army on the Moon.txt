I think Paul shares, it's pretty clear to me from his letters, but the moon is supposed
to kind of be the clearinghouse for souls.
So they think that there are these celestial winds that kind of strip away and disentangle
the, they call it the noose, but the mind from what we would call the soul.
And so then the soul is just free to move about the universe and that creative fire
goes back into the sun.
So Jesus, when he goes to heaven now, remember Paul talks about going to the third heaven
as well.
And he has a lot of language about this.
He talks about different kinds of celestial bodies in 1 Corinthians 15 and he breaks it
all down.
And it seems pretty clear to me that Paul thinks Jesus is up there between the moon
and the earth and he's just amassing his heavenly army and these, these souls.
