So when it comes to early Christian history
and to the scriptures for Christianity specifically,
I think that, again, regardless of what you think
is the ultimate purpose or source of those narratives,
they are gonna go through a process of people
not only mediating the content in terms
of what they find important,
but also in terms of their own,
sometimes access to grind or biases.
And I don't even mean that necessarily in a negative way,
like someone's trying to manipulate other people,
but sometimes, I mean, you see it in the Sinovite Gospels,
for instance, there are different points of emphasis
and different scriptures that even the gospel authors
might cite to contextualize what they're trying to claim
or other purposes that they see for their narratives.
