At that time, physical bodies that would transport or teleport or go through things like that,
and yet remain physical, was evidence of them being God.
And we see this in Matthew, because when you go to the Gospel of Matthew, they come to the tomb.
The stone is not rolled away.
The stone is there.
And yet, Jesus is not in the tomb.
Well, then how the hell did he get out?
Because once they roll the stone away, he's not there.
So it's proof to them that this man is divine.
He's divine.
And this all the way through the Gospels, the evidence of him being divine, the body going missing,
is a well-known legendary fictional trope.
