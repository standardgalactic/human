a fallacious argument means you have no way to tell whether the conclusion is true or false.
That's the beginnings of that, getting used to recognizing logical fallacies and seeing,
oh, can I construct an argument for what my position is? Do I have good reason?
After that, it's digging into broader principles like, you know, epistemology and the philosophy
of science, where, as I mentioned, Karl Popper's notions of false viability,
a hypothesis that isn't testable is useless, and a hypothesis that isn't falsifiable isn't testable.
Falsifiable just means there is, in principle, some way to show this is false.
I'm getting ready to do a video probably next week because I got in an argument on Facebook
with an individual who posted a meme that said deism is unfalsifiable, but theism is falsifiable.
