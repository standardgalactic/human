So that's the first piece, you know, like what what would it mean if these Gospels were not written by
communities but by authors who were writing within an authorship network of these what I call elite cultural producers
People who are actually literate reading other kinds of literature competing in that kind of landscape
It ships the focus from how are these communities competing with one another with their Gospels?
And how do we reconstruct them into a whole different space?
Where it's literature and authors debating with one another or overriding each other or you know
Appreciating one another and expanding their ideas like other kinds of ancient literature
