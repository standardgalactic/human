It is literally a figment of human imagination.
But once you get that sense
that there's something or somebody out there in the world,
whether it is some kind of creature that might be after us
or whether it is our deceased child
or deceased mother or deceased spouse,
and you combine it with that overactive imagination
that so many humans have,
you start to share stories around the campfire
about these unseen imagined agents
that are out there doing something,
the more personal they are,
the more meaningful they are to people,
the more they stick around.
