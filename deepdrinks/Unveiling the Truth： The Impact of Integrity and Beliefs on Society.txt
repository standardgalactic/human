So in my notes, I said, we simply do not have any reasonable evidence to suggest that they were people of great integrity.
I, it goes both ways, I think.
Yeah, like, it's just, it's just, you just throw it out there, right?
It's an assertion.
But also, like, what does, like, even if they had great integrity, there's so many people who, who die for that.
They were like, you know, I mean, one of the best tragedies in America was like, people who were so confident in their beliefs, they flew planes in the buildings.
Like, like people's beliefs, you know, you know, doesn't necessarily mean they're true.
