This was supposed to be saved for what I met you in person, but Jimmy, go fuck yourself.
With all the love in the world from Venus, go fuck yourself, Jimmy.
Go fuck yourself, Jimmy.
Go fuck yourself, Jimmy.
Hey, Jimmy, yeah, you, go fuck yourself, eh?
Hey, Jimmy, I know we don't know each other yet, but here's my introduction.
Go fuck yourself.
I'm Derek.
Go fuck yourself, Jimmy.
Go fuck yourself, Jimmy.
Hey, Jimmy, it's me.
You have no idea who I am, but I still think that you should go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself, Jimmy.
Jimmy, go fuck yourself.
Jimmy, sweetheart, darling, go fuck yourself.
Like compliments are uncomfortable for me, and that intro is so sweet and such a kind
thing that I'm beginning to hate it.
It's like, it's like, it's gone.
