I'm going to make my own shit up Christians than to have a world
full of Westboro Baptist Church.
Yeah, the map pals on the West.
Yeah.
But they're not more rational.
They are in fact less rational because Westboro Baptist Church
is looking at the plain reading of the text and saying, here's
what it actually says.
And here's what it means.
And when God says this, he means it.
This other person is I'm going to reject whatever parts I want
and accept whatever parts I want.
I have no method or mechanism.
I have no criteria for determining whether or not my beliefs are real.
