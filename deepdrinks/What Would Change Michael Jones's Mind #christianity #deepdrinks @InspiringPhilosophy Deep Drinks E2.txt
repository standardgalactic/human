What evidence or argument would you need to change your mind?
So, I mean, I look at this as sort of layers.
First, you get a deacon very much for Christianity,
and I feel like I need a naturalistic explanation
for the resurrection that's less at hawk.
And I've been around this block hundreds of times now,
and I just feel like there just isn't.
But I mean, that doesn't mean someone could come up
with something.
Maybe we'll find more evidence in the future.
Maybe we'll find some more documents
that really start to put the nail in Christianity.
Get me away from God's existence.
I don't know, a very cogent,
Graham Oppie-style argument for naturalism.
But even then, I'd probably still be more like a Tom Holland
or a Tim O'Neill-type atheist like Christianity.
He's not true, but it's done a lot of good for the world.
So I don't think I'd ever be like an anti-theist
just because the historical facts are so strong
in that sort of, in that at least that area.
But change my mind, it'd be that kind of stuff.
Those kind of layers sort of breaking things down.
