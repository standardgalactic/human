this is going to be a good one i'm very excited because ben said the magic words i'm drinking tonight
so i'm going to have more than one so i'm like awesome i'm going to join you so this is going to be
this is going to be a fun fun fun episode before we start we will be voraciously i don't know
if that's the right word muting trolls in the chat but welcome all good faith questions because
we'll do a q and a at the end but feel free to ask your questions throughout i have my mods ready to go
so make sure your questions don't sound bad faith uh because then we'll be muting you um ben
so just introduce ben ben is a fourth year medical student a trans man and is currently in
service with the united states military ben debunked pseudoscience and snake oil-esque nonsense on
his youtube channel um that is when he's not co-hosting one of the many call-in shows which
include truth wanted the transit banning call-in show talk heathen the line and many more let's
jump straight into it welcome student dr ben hello how's it going very very well i so i have a quick
quick first question as we talk about what we're drinking when you i've got a degree in marketing
um when you become a full doctor what's going to happen with your branding are you going to be
dr ben yeah i'm i'm debating kind of in my head a couple name choices we might be going family
dr ben because i'm going into family medicine uh and that makes me sound like a nice person i mean i am
a nice person but it gives me that you know i have a small town doctor type type field to the
channel and that might be what i want to do um but we'll see i that's kind of what i'm leaning towards
at this point dr ben yeah that's cool i like that i like that awesome well um what are we drinking
we are drinking a manhattan today so we had talked about lots of different options
of things to go with and i was going to go with an old-fashioned initially but somebody else was
also going to be doing an old-fashioned and uh these are very similar drinks with instead of the
sugar used in an old-fashioned we have sweet vermouth in the manhattan which gives it a little
bit more of a of some depth of flavor so i figure you know it's a great cocktail it's simple
it's very uh balanced and you know it's a great drink if anyone out there also wants to join us
and yeah for sure what what what is everyone else drinking um and also you mentioned another drink that
we didn't get around to i couldn't find it um in australia like all of australia i had to
order it online um and i left it too late like an idiot so i feel really bad but it was like
aquavit or something um i had to have this like a norwegian spirit uh yeah akavi akavi akavi yeah
it's super cool um it's it's kind of like vodka in that it's either potato based or grain based
um and not a lot of flavor on its own but it's flavored with spices like caraway and
that kind of thing i think caraway is like the most forward flavor which makes it savory and
really interesting so we are going to try to do that but it is more i screwed up i screwed up
we'll have to have you but if we have you back we'll have to do it because i was so excited to try it
and i was so bummed that i'd left it too late um and i was like why didn't i order this even if i did order
it takes about two weeks usually um australia is a bit of an island um but yeah so um so i wanted to
start i wanted to start this with a bit of fire i wanted to start this getting some venom out because
last night i uh i in preparation for this actually um because we titled this what is a man i obviously
watched uh matt welch's amazing piece of sophistry uh what is a woman uh oh it was worse than i thought
um it's horrible and i just wanted to can we just can we just sink our teeth into that just
quickly because i know a lot of people watching this might be clicking just from the name so
let's talk about this it was garbage like it was like i'm surprised so many people are like
celebrating it um because it truly like even if you take a minute to think you just it just makes no
sense what are your thoughts on it first of all yeah first of all like my main point about this is
that trans people that i know should should not be watching this it's just it's pure vitriol it's not
even a documentary it's just hate propaganda and unless you are out there to debunk it specifically
on a show or something i don't think trans people need to watch it it will do more damage to a
trans person than uh it's worth to really debunk for them um so like be careful if you're trans
and wanting to watch it it is hard it is hard to watch um but also it's it takes some very
uh bad arguments already and off like it seems to make them worse than they already were
which is hilarious because they're not going with any good arguments and it's all cherry picked
the experts they even okay i don't know if you are aware of how they picked the trans people to
interview on oh i can only imagine like they baited they baited trans people and they really gave the
assumption that it was going to be a fair uh honest inquiry of a question and so they baited
all of these trans people to appear on this show and then just brought them in to to trash them
and to make fun of them on screen yeah it's it's it's um it's interesting because what is a woman
that question is actually really complicated uh it isn't if you got like you know four brain cells
or something or like you're thinking about it from like a grade two level like you're telling
like your child like oh that's a woman that's a man like and pointing to two different people
but like the actual question is quite hard right because um because like and people answer
it in the documentary um but he he just let me just pull up something actually um i think we just
so there's something that i so i was so the big thing that they always talk about is like um
is like transgender bathrooms right that's the big thing they didn't they didn't talk too much
about it in the documentary um but they always bring it up like it's some sort of like a
like a like like trans people are going to be running around like checking out people in
the bathroom and stuff like this but they don't they don't ever consider like the the flip side of
it right so it's like so you're telling me um so so matt is saying i want to see this person
in the woman's bathroom i want to see my little girl go into a change room and buck angel is here
with his big tats bald head been trans for like 40 years um and he just he just like walks into
the cubicle like that's the the the the alternative space um but they don't ever consider that as like
like it's like i want to see this person when i go into a woman's change room or or men's change room
um for the other way around it's it's crazy um in the bathroom thing often it targets cis people
more than it does trans people out of the time because you have a range of people and in like you
can be even assigned female at birth and have very different expressions and presentations and
certain people's body features surprisingly overlap like there isn't this straight uh black and
white this is a masculine person this is a feminine person even with regard to biology there's
so much overlap and you have mostly when you target trans people uh in the bathrooms you're
targeting cis people too uh a lot of cis women with more masculine facial features or broader
shoulders or that are taller might be mistaken for a trans woman and they get kicked out so
now where are those people gonna go it when you're targeting one group of people you're not
thinking about who else are you catching in this and it's clear that they want a very simple answer
for something that absolutely is not simple and like uh an analogy that katam on gummary uses and
i'm stealing this but at least i'm giving her credit is that uh one time on transatlantic she mentioned
like if you were to try to answer the question what is the definition of a woman like take another
example of a chair and can you think of a definition that includes all chairs and excludes all
non-chairs yeah you really can't do it no it's it's like and you and you go you could ask someone
like what it's i'm just asking what a chair is you use them every day what's a chair like and then
the person's getting flustered and you're like come on like what just tell me what just tell me
clearly what what a chair is like oh so it's it's a thing that you set on oh so if i sat on the
table does that make the table a chair or did i put my food on my chair does that make it a table
it's like you can do this with almost anything and so it's a dishonest argument to to say well
this is nebulous therefore it's uh you're not answering my question and and you can even turn
this back on them uh like i would have loved to sit down with matt walsh and say what makes you a man
and see you stumble yeah because this is what i i wanted to ask you like if we can do like a game
like let's let's use what we imagine melt walsh's idea of gender is let's just use that and let's
try and work out is matt walsh a man like can we do it because like from my understanding we'd need
to see his generals right because his his ideas his concept or his chrome is well you need yeah
you need to have a combination and you'd have to see their genitals their external and internal
you'd also have to see their uh genotype so and you'd also there's a like it's constantly moving
the goalpost with what they determined to be your sex and a lot of people have decided upon
your gametes or your gamete potential so we'd have to also see that he is able to produce sperm
and that the sperm are functional that's that's what we'd have to to see here or at least that he at one
point had the potential to produce sperm so ben Shapiro is his boss right at the daily wire
so he doesn't know like ben Shapiro he doesn't know so he ben true could be girl boss like girl
boss ben Shapiro woo woo like yeah we didn't know he hasn't grabbed ben Shapiro's salty little balls
and and gone these are like natural balls to me like it's just right he doesn't know how to make us
walking around life like in ben in matt's mind he's walking around life not knowing who
like i don't know who's who like that that could be a man or a woman that could like my wife like
he he found out on his wedding night whether what are the not what gender his wife was like come on
like it's so silly yeah even they rely on self id and they're gonna their whole argument is
anti self id well you just can't you can't just declare what you are but
that's what you do every day uh like if i walked into to you on the street odds are i would refer
to you as male and i'll use male pronouns for you without even thinking about it um and
it like i'm taking you at your presentation for it i'm not looking at your karyotype i don't know
your exact biology um and if you said yeah i'm a man like i would have no problem
agreeing with you there so why is it so much of a problem that uh i present in public and
the same things that you wouldn't see uh for me you wouldn't see from me because i'm not showing you
anything in public how come we can take david's word but not mine in public for and you're going to
assume i'm male anyway they already do assume that i'm male so i'm not even asking you like at least
for me i'm not asking you to abandon your assumptions a lot of trans people like the way
that we're going in this conversation is yes we want to be more inclusive and that's why we're
using pronouns and that's why we're asking is because the assumption isn't always right so that's
that's all we're doing is just saying it like if you have a a masculine presenting cis woman
and you say how are you doing sir and she says actually it's ma'am
but they're not trans that's okay they would apologize say oh i'm sorry ma'am and move on
but if this was a trans person it's all of a sudden why do you get to define yourself as
a woman like but you're doing the same exact thing i know i know and it's it's like i don't know
what this like i don't know what this thing is about like being the arbiters of truth where you're like
show me your genitals like i want to like know what you like were born as like i just don't
like he said on when he was on dr. phil uh gender is a linguistic term you can have whatever
self perception you want but you can't expect me to take part in that self perception but
like his name is matthew walsh he asks people to call him matt like he's he's like birth
certificate name i call him matt walsh because that's how he wants to be known in the world is
it so hard to be like yo dude like i'm i'm i'm actually a woman and you're like oh okay ma'am like
is that so hard like i i just don't see why it's such like a such like a um a big issue um you know
it's just it's it's nuts um and for most of it like for most of it like unfortunately because i
i don't um i don't personally have to deal with this like the constant need to um kind of defend
my identity um like i'm sure yourself and most trans people have to have to constantly go
through so so when i was watching the show it was a mixture of like anger i just had stupid the
arguments were and laughter at like the insanity that i was seeing i wasn't necessarily like
emotional about it i didn't actually consider that you know a trans person watching this might
be quite harmed by what they were they hearing but one part did get to me one part got to me
i paused the documentary and i went looking there was that um that person the trans man
that was on and they said they've been they've been studies that say transitioning helps mental
health they've all been retracted that's not true it's so not true that's not true and also the
it's funny when when they bring in these grifters like that that trans man in the video or
people like buck angel or blare white or any any of those trans people that i've decided to side
with the with the transphobes and there's some interesting and i brought him up for a reason for
that reason by the way i knew he was part of the yeah and and like he so he didn't transition
as a kid and and they in the documentary they're using him to say this is why you shouldn't
mutilate children which that's a big piece of misinformation because we are not doing genital
surgeries on children we do not do that in fact the people that want to do genital surgeries on
children are the ones advocating for assigning intersex kids to a sex before they're of the age
of consent so it's actually their side that is doing the unnecessary harm to children we are not
advocating for that in any way but they're saying like look at this this person's forearm scar from his
falloplasty we shouldn't be doing this kids we're not he transitioned like in his 40s so he made that
conscious decision as an adult to do that and you have every right to do that and and you have every
right as well to to detransition and there's an important point with people who there are
about 2% on average it's what we're seeing from the studies of people who want to detransition
or who don't who decide that that transition was not right for them and we don't disown these people
i think the detransitioners are evidence that gender dysphoria is a real thing you have people who
maybe it wasn't the right move for them and they got dysphoric from transitioning which only shows
that there is some part of you that that has a sense of gender and that you want to be comfortable
with yourself and most of the trans community will happily accept you as a detransitioner
as long as you know you're you're saying that this is my detransition but there are other trans
people that do not regret their transition but you get certain people like this this one guy and
there's another one on on twitter not too long ago who you look into their story and they go on this
well i transitioned and it sucked i hate it and then they make no effort to detransition none like
and they even one of them even said like i'm very happy living as a man but i just don't want to make
people uncomfortable and something it's like so so it's a social thing and you don't want to
detransition you just that you enjoy living as a man so maybe this is right for you and you're just
trying to get sympathy from from people and it turned out that this person on twitter um
it was complaining about being bald uh after starting tea which looking into the story he had a
history of pc os which he was already going bald before tea so you start looking into the details
and a lot of these people that are grifters are not communicating the whole story and if you had
all of the information uh you can't really use them as examples in favor of the transphobes they
actually give more information as to to why we need to take care of people better and and be more
inclusive so it's um that guy uh the specific in the video that yeah so when that when he said
that i was like okay like this is a new documentary i'll look up the studies like i'll look up because
you know i'm i'm familiar with we might talk about vaccines like i'm i'm familiar with um uh
andrew wakefields 1998 lancet paper and it's still there like you know the the illuminati aren't
hiding it it just has a big retracted stamp across it right and like you can still look at it it's
but it's like it's obvious that it's retracted i look for these retracted studies that he spoke
about i couldn't find any um given i didn't go through every medical journal but um but what
i did find was uh on korn kornel dot edu i found a systematic review and i'll just read it here
we conducted a systematic literature review of all peer reviewed articles published in english
between 1991 and june 2017 that assesses and um the effects of gender transition on transgender
well-being we identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic of which 51 so 93
percent found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people while
four seven percent reported mixed or null findings we found no studies concluding that gender
transition caused overall harm and this this like this is all just there like and to me the fact that
that matt uh well should just decided to leave that that point in the documentary but didn't fact
check it uh well he probably did he has to be a bad faith actor at this point he like oh yeah
there's no way that he can be like i'm making an honest documentary and then doesn't look up like it
took me five minutes to find this quote and to see all studies listed and i clicked and i opened the
first line of studies to check that they weren't retracted they're all there and this the findings were
all there it was all it was all up to date like it it it blew me away um yeah there's one study
that they they like to cite frequently which does not say what they think it does uh they use it to say
that gender affirming surgery uh or people that undergo gender affirming surgery have higher rates
of suicidality and mental health issues um but actually with the study you said it was not comparing
trans people pre-surgery to trans people post-surgery it compared trans people with cis people
so yeah we know that trans people have higher rates of suicidality and mental health issues
of course usually related to societal treatment of trans people and lack of access to care and other
facilities but you can't cite that and say that this is about post-op trans people when this is about
post-op trans people compared to their cis counterparts that never had gender dysphoria to begin with
or those other studies that uh show one of the studies that they try to use to show regret rates
for trans people um included gender non-conforming kids so even if you had a boy that identified
as a boy and played with dolls or did some feminine activity they would be labeled as gender
non-conforming and thus included in the trans group for the study so many of those people would not be
included they would not meet inclusion criteria for uh first study on trans people so they're citing
studies that have obvious flaws to them and it's very easy to debunk these points because of that
and it leads often often these um these talking points um lead straight to the conclusion um that
their progressive um progressive side is pointing to like we should be more inclusive we should
you know be respectful of trans like if trans people have a high rate of suicide it's like well let's
let's do everything we can to stop them from you like killing themselves like this like
like but that's not the conclusion they arrive at they arrive at some like
wacko like like other worldly like conclusion it's it's it's bizarre um or like the other one uh
they just i just want to mention the study the twin study which had a botched um circumcision
and so a doctor convinced the parents to raise the botched child twin sorry those two twins as
a woman as a as a girl um and they quote they could and and he says it's like it's a point
they could never accept their gender it's like yeah because the gender was male it's it's evidence
in favor of our point that that you have some innate gender identity that even if you take somebody
and change their genitals it does not change what's in their brain yeah and so the points that
they think are proving their point are not they're proving our points that gender dysphoria
is a real thing and that conversion therapy doesn't work because that's what essentially you did
to that kid like you forcibly assigned that kid and then use conversion therapy on him and it didn't
work yeah so how's that gonna work on anybody else the whole thing is just a big like it's one of
my favorite um it's one of my when i'm debating someone who's a bad faith actor um i turn off the
good faith as well um i'll usually meet them where they are and i'll i'll throw the burden of proof
back on them the whole time burden of proof just i'll never take i'll never take anything i'll just
i'm giving away my secrets here but that's essentially what the documentary is is him just going
like it's so funny too because i've recorded myself watching and i'm i won't release it
anywhere i don't think but he says um he says something like um like you know these people
don't have all the answers so i'm gonna go to a university and i paused and i was like let me like
they're gonna find the most like feminist bluehead like you know professor that they can in the
world sure enough next like press play bluehead like gender study is like of course like they're
not finding they're fine that i think they probably did like a hundred times more interviews
and they just like whittled it down to the people that they could make look like they had the most
extreme position on one side um and then he comes in there's like that i just like to go fishing you
know i just a normal man i you know i wear flannel it shirts i tuck them in and i'm just trying
to work it what's going on it's like no you're not you're a bad faith actor also like why do you
why is your opinion of someone who's never studied sociology or psychology or medicine or any of
these uh fields that are relevant to the conversation why is your perspective
given equal platforming to a doctor of sociology and gender studies like why are these they're
obviously these two opinions are not equal and i hate that the desire society and and like
as one of the downsides of having a democratic republic where people view their opinions as
being equal because they have an equal vote like no your opinion is not equally valid to somebody
that has studied this in depth and has learned the nuance of the conversation like they want to be a
nuance free conversation and this is the same argumentation that we see from these uh on a lot of
these these shows that i'm on and uh all over twitter they want things to be a very a conversation
devoid of nuance and um like if you get into a a debate with somebody about creationism uh oftentimes
the theist will go to a but it's just much more simple to think this way it's like but simplicity
is not like because the argument is simple does not mean that it's true and and i think that that's a
similar argumentation point that they use here is that well our definition is simple and and so it's
true like no it's it's devoid of nuance and like they'll they'll say well but basic biology well basic
biology is only okay until it's overturned by advanced biology like if you haven't understood the
advanced biology yeah true then it's like basic biology is so dumb down to a point where like it's
it's for beginners you start off with the beginning until you can learn to recognize the nuance and
understand the more in-depth process like you you take this with any any field of study at all you take
a high school course on it like yeah okay you're getting a very watered down version but that's
appropriate if you're a 15 year old kid you go to college you study the same thing it's a little bit
more in-depth but still not not quite there you get a master's degree you add some more like okay now
you're starting to feel stupid because it's a lot more difficult than you thought it was and then
you enter a doctorate program it's even worse and then you go in your field and it's the same it just
gets more and more in-depth and and you learn what misinformation you you had yesterday is false
and so they're stuck at the the college level biology like the the gen bio level biology and saying
they're not even there they're not even they're still in grade three they're still in like grade three biology
like but but basic biology well but well hold on the advanced biology disagrees with you so you
can claim for basic biology but your basic biology is is wrong and that's just that's just a fact like
it's not it's not like i'm expecting everybody to go get a doctorate i'm not saying that but if you're
not looking into that level of detail then you can't be the arbiter and what's true and not and i'm
not saying either that a doctorate is going to be the arbiter because they're all constantly arguing
with each other about their field of study and that's why we have peer review but it's just
the the dunning kruger effect is is so real and so incredibly frustrating
but what gets me about the whole thing is like he's masquerading as he's trying to get to the truth
and he's masquerading is like you know science told me that a meal is this like he's masquerading
he's trying to be scientific and he does this like he does this big ass straw man when he's talking to
that um his agenda studies professor or the pediatric professor um yeah and she says something like
santa is real for my children and then he's like yeah but santa isn't real and then and then like we know
santa isn't real for my children and then he takes that straw man like takes that and he straw man
and then he's like this entire argument like what is a woman and like he goes and interviews a bunch of people
but it's like i the irony was like slapping me in the face about like his position starts with the god
belief that he has no evidence for zero like if he had any evidence it would be studied at universities
and in in like a form of like epistemology not just like theology um no evidence for takes it on faith
uh and then and then masquerades as if like he's not doing the same thing that children do with santa
like my truth your truth is like no there is just is truth where's your truth on the god claim
like just and then like if you put like if i could lock him in a little black room with me like a little
room with one little light bulb or we could sit down we weren't leaving until we agreed on terms
um i think that he would have to just he would retreat to faith when you pressed him on his god
belief like he wouldn't have an answer and it's like you're doing the same thing and like the irony just
just like it made me so happy and angry at the same time it was amazing like i just the the
feelings like the the um you know the right always talks about triggered lefties i was a triggered
lefty but in the best way possible when i was watching that um it was it is amazing um
um
yes i could go on about ranting about matt walsh this whole time but
but yeah his documentary uh could you sum it up in one word what would you say if you sum it up in
one word bad that's like i don't need a whole lot of a whole lot of fancy words like i
just say it's bad yeah i think i'd actually disagree with you i think it's really good in
like the way it's presented and stuff i just think if you if you've taken a proper look at it
it is very i would agree it's very bad i think the problem is it's actually really good like you
know jerry rogan the filmmaking the film yeah is done like it's good for a propaganda piece
yeah like in in functioning as propaganda they do a good job doing the propaganda so i will i will
give give you that yeah but in terms of being factual i'm sure mind calm was beautifully written like
mind calm was perfect but yeah but it's not good yeah i'd say garbage um like garbage points i'd
have to use two words um but that's enough about matt walsh um and i will use his preferred name
because we're inclusive here because we're nice uh yeah it's nice um uh so
so i did want to get into your story obviously um so you grew up religious uh and now yeah and
you're a trans man so yeah i'm sure that's a wild story can you tell us about it um yeah so i'm
actually kind of like a minister's kid so not like a full-on pastor i guess but in the us we have
a lot of these college ministries like these bible study youth groups that uh happen on college
campuses and i mean their main goal is to basically convert college kids to to whatever religion
and so my parents work for one of those so i've been around the church forever um like in
organizational sense and i was one of those kids this is actually interesting because
even from being very young like i never evaluated the claims of christianity because i was afraid of
hell like i was afraid of hell like even since i was really little and i throughout like my childhood
there'd have like these altar calls and stuff and while i had like accepted jesus at at a very young age
i still felt the need to re-accept multiple times because i didn't know if my first time was good
enough and i didn't want to go to hell because i i didn't do well enough the first time or i wasn't
sincere enough the first time and all of that like really really hit me hard i i grew up with a lot of
feelings of shame and guilt and i've never felt good about myself and
i i just kind of accepted everything on face value from what people were telling me
it was based on on that fear aspect so i i thought uh going into college like i was the super
academic person i was like yeah i'm gonna study apologetics and we're gonna like and i was a theater
major for the first part of college before switching to biology because that was actually a fun
story in that um i basically believed that uh you had certain talents and they were god given to you
and god had your destiny set for you and that's what you're gonna do and i was raised in the theater
so like my dad's a minister my mom is the theater director so uh being in the theater since age five
i was like yeah i've been gifted in theater i'm going to be i'm gonna go do acting and that's
my lot in life and then it turns out in college i realized that it's a choice like people that went
into medicine chose that like they're not any more special than me like god didn't give them
this particular path like it's they made a choice and they went for it and i said hey i could i could
do that too i can also make that choice and so i changed my major to biology and it's amazing how
long i held on to theism throughout that because i had no good reasons for it and and every time i went
to a pastor or somebody with the same concerns it was always like hey this argument isn't really a
good argument like we're and especially with regard to how they chose books of the bible and
things like what what made these books legitimate and these ones not like we don't like the catholics
obviously but like what makes the apocrypha something that we don't do but but they do
and no good answers coming for why we chose what books we did and and why we believe what we do
and it it gave me questions and then there's stance on gay people and trans people and i was i was
very closeted at the time like didn't even wasn't even really aware of myself at the time
just because i wasn't allowed to be i didn't know we were a thing um but as i kept going through my
biology degree i came to more questions and number one was human evolution is not at all what
the church had claimed it was like so they're already wrong on on one point like so what else are
they wrong about and and just as i discovered more about the world and discovered how unwilling
these people were to accept what was clearly science uh like i'd move from like young earth creationist
to evolutionary theist to like and at that point too like my my anti-vax beliefs were challenged as
well because my family is also very anti-vax and so that was challenged i found out that hey there's no
good evidence to demonstrate a harm of vaccines so i abandoned that belief uh and and as i was just
you know going through each of these claims i eventually ended up at uh watching axp and other shows
and i was like this isn't true like and there's no way that i can go back to believing something
that i'm not convinced is true matt dillahunty's evil spirit got you he got tate huskens he got you
he got myself it's just start watching ax you know the atheist experience and that's what happens um
did up it's a joke by the way everyone no it's funny too because my family i'm i'm sure by now
that they know i'm a host of toky then because like it's hard to hide anything yeah that's on the
internet from from your family um so i'm sure that they're aware they're aware that i'm an atheist
i was kind of forced to come out to them as an atheist in that when i was still in college um they kind
of gave me like an intervention of like you're gonna go to church or else and i was like i had to come
out at that point like hey i don't believe this shit and that's why i'm not going to church anymore
but um so they know i'm an atheist but like it'd be funny if if they knew the fact that like
they had raised me to to be this very religious person and now i'm hosting like the second biggest
atheist college on the internet but you know that's a different point they'll they'll find out soon
enough and maybe they'll call it i don't know what kind of um i have to know i'm i'm taking some guesses
but what kind of christian were you evangelical uh yeah okay so usually yeah like there's evangelical
because we don't really have evangelicals in in australia they're like more pentecostals i guess
yeah we weren't that far um all the churches i went to were non-denominational so okay
yeah just kind of was there like worship um sometimes prayer flags um like yeah worship
flags like speaking in tongues that kind of thing we didn't have any of that we didn't have any of
speaking in tongues like none of the weird stuff um but it was like we were one of those churches though
that like had the like the rock band for worship yeah it was very contemporary to try to keep you there and
like very uh you couldn't really define them as as being a specific denomination but it's clearly
protestant of the protestant variety and the like didn't have a whole lot of
polarizing views in terms of what branch of protestantism so
yeah right so so you came out to your family as atheists i remember seeing a show with you a year ago
or so uh where you they they didn't know that you were trans yet uh because you're only recently
trans right like over the last few years yeah i transitioned i started transition after my first
year of med school so i did a whole year of medical school before transitioning and i came out to them
a year ago uh in december wow okay so can you tell us a little bit about how that went
it was bad it was bad time oh yeah um but i i don't regret it still because i'm much happier
knowing that they know and i don't have to hide anything like they don't approve at all
and they said some very horrible things to me which i'm not going to say here because they're very
horrible things um but and it all come it all came down to like
they don't want me forcing my lack of religious views on them
like okay calm the fuck down that's not what i'm doing and like calling somebody by their preferred
name and pronouns is not forcing you to abandon your religious beliefs like calm down
and yeah they they're taking a like martyr stance that they don't deserve at all for that but
but you know it's the the old yeah they're just like sorry to so first of all for those who
don't know this show um we have deep conversations over deep drinks i invite christians on i like christians
i invite harry christians on i invite everyone this isn't just an atheist calling show
so excuse me as i rant just for a second about i'm christians but they have this like
intense persecution complex i find a lot of time some don't but some definitely do and it's like
you know you know it's like i remember when same-sex marriage the plebiscite was coming around
australia and everyone was voting on the right on whether or not um like members of the lgbt
community could have the could have human rights and be able to get married um they they were like
they thought it was persecution on them somehow and i i still couldn't but i was like
like has god instituted marriage so it's like so it would never be between a man and a man
and a woman and a woman and i'm like okay but i'm like okay so so so great so like that doesn't
matter then if the if they are considered by law because you wouldn't consider them as married so
that's fine right and he's like well i still won't vote and i was like but wait what like i'm so confused
like your church can still deny a religious marriage for them like that's like do whatever you
want in your religion but don't take away all of my options with the court like if i get a court
marriage like so be it but like maybe i don't want to get married in your church anyway yeah i'll ask
them like wait so so can atheists get married can satanists get married if it's ordained by god like
what like what like is it only a christian thing or like are they not considered married because
they're not through the eyes of god or like you know like what or can a hindu couple get married
and like um i remember asking um just asking like okay so let's say a gay couple get married
is it more of a sin for them to stay married or get divorced because like divorce is a sin
and like ah like brain does not compute and like they yeah it's like yeah so it just amazes me
or like i had a family member a friend's mother walked past like a poster in an airport that said
like love is love virgin australia or something and like does this have to be shoved in an earth road
every second of every day and it's just like wow like it's like that it's not it's just that like it's just
there and it's it's funny for me like funny not in the ha ha funny but like a bad funny like
you're gonna take this persecution complex and be like you're interfering on my right to be christian
it's like think about this like you have a trans person talking to you
like if we worked and i'm not saying that you should necessarily compare your miseries to somebody
else because like that's kind of meaningless but in this particular case like you have a trans person
have have you as a christian in the united states have you ever been given a death threat have you ever
been denied healthcare have you ever been denied bathroom use have you ever been called
a slur for for who you are like you compare these things like you're you're saying that you're
being persecuted because someone asked you to use a certain name and pronouns for them like i get harassed
on a daily basis like i get death threats i get people saying why don't you kill yourself
like so if you're gonna play that card why are you playing that card when you haven't experienced
any of these things in the face of somebody who does like yeah you are the persecuted one here
when we're the ones actively fighting for our rights to exist in like the state of florida
and the state of texas like and this is not an exaggeration want to get rid of trans people
they want to exterminate trans people by whatever means they can whether it be they go into hiding
and never come out of the closet or they end themselves they don't care they don't want trans
people to exist in that state or if they leave or people leave the state of florida because they're
trans they don't care by what means but they don't want us there so like you cannot compare
these experiences and it's an absolute slap in the face for anybody that says like who is not part of
an actual like a press group of people who is in fact the majority in the country still for now
to say yeah well but you're you're not letting me call you a slur so i'm persecuted yeah like
it's like society it's like hey we've noticed that you've got this like giant stick and you've been
hitting people with this stick for like a long time we're gonna remove that stick and they're like
how dare you take away my stick i was i loved hitting people with like i'm persecuted no you're not
persecuted society's taking away the big stick you've been whacking them wrong with like um
yeah um did you uh did you
i'm just trying to think of where to um of which oh that's right that's what i wanted to ask you
so one of my discord one of my discord friends they're like a philosophy
major and they're probably gonna go on to do some other stuff as well that every time i have like
deep questions especially about morality i'll like call them up
and talk to them about them so they have this question and so i know it's a good faith question
uh but i think it could be like a good place to kind of explore more of the more topic so what is
gender and how does it differentiate from sex yeah so this is uh definitely an interesting
conversation and i'm gonna add a third term in here so we'll talk about sex we'll talk about
gender and we'll talk about gender identity because there's slightly different things um so sex and
i disagree with a lot of the gender criticals or the transphobes out there about what sex means
um a lot of people will say that sex okay yeah i just i just want to interrupt i'm going to
what i'm going to do is i'm going to try and push back a little bit um through this conversation
not because i disagree with you but because i want to i want to see i want to push the
buttons to see what kind of falls out what we can kind of i'm i'm with you in this conversation
i'm just yeah don't yeah and because you people face this discussion and and how to approach
this kind of discussion in public so um with sex the way i see it is it is a combination
of biological factors so uh while a lot of people might rely on one keystone biological
factor i disagree with that because it is the combination that produces the result and one
factor in itself does not produce the result so people might say it's external anatomy but the
problem there is that some people can have external anatomy that does not align with internal
anatomy so like the penis or the vagina is a separate entity from the testes and the ovaries
and the uterus and the prostate and all that they they come from different chemical pathways that
trigger those so um you can have somebody with both male and female external anatomy or both male
and female internal anatomy or somebody who has male external anatomy and female internal anatomy
like they might have a penis uh and a uterus so i differentiate those two aspects of anatomy
there's also hormonal sex which is the hormones that you produce whether it's
testosterone dominant or estrogen dominant and then your genetics which would be either
x x x y x x y x y y any of those combinations uh usually related to the sry gene uh which can
translocate um so a sry is the testis determining factor which causes the testis to develop
which usually in a in someone who has all of their sexual characteristics congruent um sry would
make a biological male but sometimes that sry gene translocates to the x chromosome so you
can have somebody who is xx that presents with a completely male anatomy and hormone presentation
so it's that's why since there's so much variability this is why i i determine it uh to be a
combination of factors which then also accounts for the the spectrum of sex yeah so like um yeah uh
what's that term um i always forget what it is it's like people who are born with
like they're not they're not like there's like a bunch of characteristics that make up like male
or female and then there's someone there's like intersex intersex yeah okay so is am i correct
am i incorrect in assuming that like i've heard that there are like 16 characteristics this is old though
this is old news so it might be wrong but 16 characteristics that make up biological male
or biological female in human adults like roughly well probably not roughly but let's just say 16
because i forgot then maybe we forgot the real number but it's close 16 okay and um and that's like
you know hormones um you know x y chromosomes like genitals internal genitals things like that um
and there are someone for someone to be intersex means that one of those things doesn't
align and if you use that category use that category categorization there are more people
who are intersex than people who have red hair so this is like it's like a now given you wouldn't
be able to tell for the majority of intersex people so it's not like there are like people with
two different uh genitals and stuff running around um more than red hair people but along
there's some grouping of um of things like that by definition they would be intersex is that right
yeah so people with klinefelter uh for example who are x x y chromosomes so they are both x x
and x y they typically present as phenotypic males so their external anatomy is all male
their internal anatomy is all male the difference is they a lot of people with klinefelter do not know
they have klinefelter until puberty or until they get a fertility test because many of them
are not fertile so like you can go almost your entire life without knowing you have something
like this and it just pops up incidentally so that's why i say it's a combination um and that's
where i would disagree with with a lot of people that say that like people will say that there's a
keystone factor that determines like they might say s r y is the key factor that makes you male or
female well no but because you can have s r y and still be uh have some anatomical difference that
makes you testosterone dominant or estrogen dominant when you wouldn't be otherwise there's a
whole lot of factors that play into this so i'm not willing to give them one factor it's multifactorial
as is most most uh everything that happens to to human bodies there's almost never one factor
that determines an outcome it's multiple factors so that's why i think instead of saying that
there's one primary factor that we give credit to all of the factors that contribute so
so that's yeah right i don't know if you have any more questions or thoughts on that particular
no no so so yeah so i understand biological sex um and then i'm sure we're going to go
into gender but i guess what i've got a question on a first question i have about that is um is is
set is biological sex usually connected to gender or not for the majority of people yes okay okay
so what is gender so gender is the uh societal it's a way that you interact with society
according to a certain gender identity so we'll get into gender identity in a little bit but it's
this is gender is where you get the the roles the stereotypes the social norms and this can
change depending on society so you'll know like in biblical times people men and women
wore things that look like dresses they all a lot of them wore similar things and so it's while
a dress today might seem taboo for a man to wear in other cultures that might be deemed to be masculine so it
is more nebulous and it is more flexible based on culture but that's the whole point it's it's
where you've moved from sex which is biology this is now sociology so it is how you engage with
the society around you according to um your your gender identity so do you have any questions on that
because i know it's more nebulous um well i guess my and this is might might be a big one so we might
might save it but do you think like so you're you're obviously trans so but do you think if you
grow up and this isn't this is a white hypothetical but this is what we do on deep drinks maybe pour yourself
another drink um okay um uh if you grew up in a vacuum meaning you had no outside influence like
you were just this in this perfectly white room like the matrix or something right um do you think
you would have gender dysphoria or did you have gender dysphoria or do you think you'd be trans or
what do you think you could just express yourself however yeah i don't i don't know and that's
interesting because i i think i still would i would have my my preferences and my expression
but i don't think it would be as tied to gender because there would be a concept of gender if
there's no concept of gender i would just express myself in the way that i want to and i maybe say yeah
these pronouns sound like something that i like the word of or this outfit is something that i like or
this this is how i want my hair to look this is the name that i like and it i might end up the same
kind of person but the it might also be different because the way that i present myself right now
is with the fact that i grew up in american society in uh like the late 90s and in 2000s
and so my engagement with society is rooted partially in the culture that i grew up in and
that's that's part of any sociological concept right so so would you how do you feel about
gent this is sorry this is all we're gonna get come back to gender but yeah this is tangential
how do you feel about gender abolitionists or people who just think you know we should just
remove the idea of gender men can wear dresses women can yeah i don't know so it's an
interesting thing to think about because um i think it would it would work in a society that
already doesn't have uh thoughts about gender culturally because i really don't see a problem
with just taking away gender at all and just you being you like i think that's great um in terms of
you know yeah yeah but then in terms of expression like is gender expression is separate from your
gender identity so you can have any gender identity and still express yourself in a completely
different way that's not congruent with your gender identity so i think it would be difficult to
implement something like that in a society that has already established cultural norms
surrounding gender but if you if you took a society of people who all agreed to
uh abandon cultural gender norms like i wouldn't be opposed to that honestly
like i i i think that'd be fine it could be fun it could be like a fun um a fun society um
um right okay so i don't have any other questions on that tangent tangent tangent um
do you want to circle back to what you're talking about with gender and gender identity yeah so so gender
and gender identity are different in that so if we divide them all up by field so we had sex as
biology gender is sociology and gender identity is psychology so this is um how you view yourself
this is your uh your your self awareness your self actualization just your your view of of yourself
and this is where it gets very very nebulous because everybody's self is different and it's very difficult
to define the self and and psychologists have been trying to do this as long as psychology has
been a thing and even as long as philosophy has been a thing people have been trying to to define
the self what is the self and like something that at least with utility to society because
in terms of like if i were just a mentally masturbate on what is myself i could be here for
eternity without having an answer and some people love to think about that i i don't i like utility so
viewing this from a uh from a perspective of utility my perception of myself is that uh
i see myself as masculine i see myself as a man and that for me is going to align with uh wanting
to be seen in society as a man so this is where gender identity ties back in to gender so my sense of
self wants to be seen as that self by other people in the community so in doing that what uh
like let's take two equal things like and this is actually how one tool that i used to to
decide uh what my own gender was uh i like vikings vikings are cool a lot of people like vikings
let's so i took example of two vikings one had the body of a man the other had a body of a woman
and you cannot argue at all that one viking is more strong than the other one they're
equal in their strength in their capabilities all that's the same yeah the only difference is what
they look like and how they interact with society one's a he him one's a she her one abides by
some more masculine norms one abides by by feminine norms and those can even be flexible
but for me it was like if i could have the choice between these two people these two almost identical
people i picked the one in the male body every time yeah that's how i see myself and somebody
else might see them in in the female body and and so it's the the biology that i have does not
align with the biology that my psychological self sees which which causes a disconnect so it's
while it's very difficult to define what a psychological gender identity is you can pretty
easily think about it in terms of examples in the real world of like an even even foreign example
like this is something taking something that is more stereotypically feminine like there's
certain things in my life that are feminine that i i enjoy doing um yeah like i was a cheerleader
in in high school when i presented as a woman and i i enjoyed it it was a great sport it's fun
i liked performing i like dancing but i always wanted to be a male cheerleader but they do
kind of the same thing like they're both cheerleaders they're both doing something very feminine
with regard to society so expression is is is kind of irrelevant there yeah but one's a man one's a
woman which one do i want to be doing the same exact thing i want to be the man okay i think it's
solidified for me where i fall on this and and i guess like everyone in the audience if you want
to think about two identical scenarios and which one you choose maybe it tells you a little bit more
about yourself but i know there's a little bit of a rant but i know a great rant and um we always
love a good rant here it's usually it's me though um but the it's what i appreciate it but something
that story out to me is um something that i remembered sorry was when i was younger i used to play
skirm i still play video games all the time but i used to play skirm which is an Elder Scrolls game
and my younger brother he used to always choose well he didn't always but he would sometimes choose
to play as a lady like he'd build a lady character and play it and watch him and always be like why
like this is so confused like it made me angry i was like i don't understand why
but for him he's not trans or anything but for him um he was playing he was watching
it appeared as if he was watching someone else's story like he was watching he was playing
like he was watching a female play a game right where for me when i played skirm i was that character
like i made choices that in that game i never joined the dark brother hood i was always like
the good night in the game you know like i always did certain things um and so i couldn't relate
to my brother choosing like the girl because he because i was like but how do you relate because
we're viewing the game differently but it's just interesting that um that well i've learned to
to sense be able to play as a girl character i'm not i'm not weird but but um i am weird but
but i've but at the time it's funny because like it felt really funny to me to put myself
into the position of a gender that wasn't that i didn't align with and to pretend that i was another
gender that didn't feel that didn't feel like it just felt like i would rather just be the other
gender i'd rather just be the male gender um and i'm sure for you like i don't know if you
ever played video games but like this is a great story actually because this was pre-transition me
like back in in high school into college where like i would play these mmorpgs and there were times
when i learned i learned like as a kid that uh people on the internet don't they don't know what
you look like they don't know who you are you're in a chat bar on the side they don't know yeah so i said
okay i can play with my identity in the space where nobody knows any different and so i would
play as male characters and i would engage in chats saying i was a guy nobody questioned anything
and then i would leave the game and say if only that could be real life and for some reason i never
grasped that i was trans like it never clicked for me that like maybe that was who i was and that i was
only had the safe space in the video game to be who i was and then because i had times where i
play as a female character because i felt i was obligated to i didn't want to i felt like i was obligated
to and so gender dysphoria like displays like as you you saw there like with you in the video
game character that's gender dysphoria like you experienced that really i didn't i never considered
like considered that i i that that feels almost like um it feels almost like offensive to people like
people who actually go through like horrible well no it's it's accurate you you in trying to experience
uh another gender that wasn't you and feeling uncomfortable with representing yourself as that
gender that's that's dysphoria and that's valid and and like part of our argument here too like in
inclusion of trans people is acknowledging that cis people if if i were to take a cis person and
reassign them or have them go through conversion therapy they would probably get gender dysphoria
the majority of them would just like that twin that twin study you know yeah unfortunately you know i
i know that both of those twins died and i think the one of them died of suicide i think the
the transition one which is horrible it's a it's just i i just wish society this is considered
a bit hippie but i just wish the society would just like we could just like i don't know it just
except people for i guess who they are um yeah um there's there's an analogy that again
crediting katie montgomery because she has been in this debate space a lot longer than i have
i love katie by the way i don't i haven't like watched a whole lot of her stuff but every
time i do see her i'm like she's about us yeah yeah there's this one analogy that she gives that
is really solid and it's trying to to help cis people understand what gender dysphoria feels like
to a trans person especially a trans person who doesn't know that they're trans
because many of us go years without even batting an eye at the fact that we might be trans
but imagine you have two people next to each other and they're both on like some some wheel
or they're on a wall or like imagine like a medieval torture device where they're one person is
strapped right side up and the person next to them is strapped upside down and that's but they've
always been like that they don't know anything different than the way that they've been like from
birth they've been in this position and the person that's upside down says you know i think something's
not right and i don't know what it is but something's not right here and the person next to them
who's right set up says no i don't see a problem like this is fine well like of course you think
it's fine because you're in the right position and you have been the whole time but to somebody who's
upside down and they don't know they're upside down like it's hard to communicate what exactly is
wrong if you've never experienced anything beyond that but like for that person it's upside down and
that's the same way for trans people like for us it we we feel upside down and we can't always articulate
why we feel upside down but it's not helpful for someone who's not upside down to tell us no you're fine
just deal with it because you might be in the right position but we aren't and like it would just be
simpler to instead of telling us to deal with the where we're at like come over and flip us the right
way and then surprise we feel better you flip us over to to where our head is facing upward and and
suddenly suddenly i don't feel bad anymore that's that's the another thing that they mentioned in the
documentary but they like made it sound worse it was like people people who transition
have a um they have a higher rate of suicide than the typical sys people but like what is
suicidality this yeah oh yeah i can't imagine um what it would be like but the typical sys person um
no but typical but that sorry they have a much they have that not a much they have a higher rate
of like depression and suicide but it's way further down than than pre-transition um which is the point
yeah that's why yeah it's healthcare um you you actually this is this is something that is a little
interesting and if we don't if you don't want to go into it um no we're good i'm done i'm making another
another drink so i my inhibitions are are lessened even more so now i should have got
you to sign a consent form before you're sober um so there's uh so uh so you first um i had feelings
that you were gay right yeah can i clarify real quick before we get into the intense
discussion i got dorna up ahead in the side chat saying old fashioned from a bottle blasted me
it's not this is whiskey this is straight whiskey and this is and we're making
Manhattan's and this is vermouth so they're in bottles but they're they went into a shot glass
and then are going into the glass so okay there we go side grant over uh and uh and
angel i see a question we'll ask it at the end i'm for sure because it's a great question um
so yeah you originally you originally started and you thought um you were gay right but now
like you're a man so it's like are you straight is that like how like are you still like you're
attracted to ladies right is that i'm by i'm by oh so you're by oh you see well i wasn't always
it's funny because for me um i was only attracted to women until i started to stoster own
and now i'm attracted to men so it's funny that people will say that gay people are a result
of hormone imbalance and that uh i just wasn't into men because whatever like well actually the more
masculine i've become the more attracted to men i've become so i've just been destined to be gay
this whole time i don't know like no matter what side i'm on i'm gay well i've often said like
bisexual you get the best of both worlds you can check out everybody in this in the shopping
center which is yeah so have you noticed like i i've got no filter so if you don't want to answer
any of these just let me just say okay let's not i'm gonna answer that but have you noticed
since taking testosterone um have you gotten more i have no idea how it affects like your sexual
drive has your sexual drive increased because oh yeah testosterone okay true it's weird interesting
so is it the is it the opposite for like hormone for hate um i've heard i've heard for some people
for some people yeah um i think not for everybody but for some people it does reduce their libido
and it's interesting because the it changes the orgasm too a little bit which this is deeply
personal um but so what i've noticed with uh before testosterone it's a lot slower
and less powerful of like an orgasm of an orgasm yeah uh then when i started t it's a lot
faster and like more immediately powerful just for the orgasm that's great um wow that's
that's um it it's it's super it must it must be like beyond all the you know um you know trying to
get back to or trying to get to the state where you feel most comfortable in your body and stuff
beyond all that you know the the back kind of the the the baggage the high emotional highs and lows it
must be missing all that out like it must be weird to be taking certain medications that affect your
biology or your um your affects yourself so much like is is it like i've i've had experience
i want easy presence um that affects me a little bit but i can't imagine um all in good ways by
the way except for a dry mouth for the first two weeks but i can't imagine what it's like to take
something that doesn't affect you so much like does it oh it's great yeah yeah well everyone should
just take tea well no but i mean for me like my confidence like even the a lot of the physiological
effects don't take place for weeks to months to years on tea but even within the first week my
confidence level improved dramatically and it was the sense that like i now have some physiology
that aligns with my psychology and that's really all it was and it's powerful and i think that
like and i'm not telling people to experiment with hormone therapy like because it can do some
like if you go on it and you don't want to go on it it can give you dysphoria so like don't just try it but
yeah but you can tell like some people and i don't know why and there's no good science on why and i
don't even necessarily think we need the science for why uh because i think it would further limit people
if we just went into like why are you trans but the fact is that some people some people's psychology
works better with an estrogen dominant body and some people's brains and their psychology
work better with a testosterone dominant body and and i i don't think we necessarily need to investigate
why but the fact is i feel better and i know people who are trans women who feel way better on
estrogen and i will never understand them i will absolutely never understand people who want more
estrogen in their body because i can't do it i can't yeah but that's that's instead of me saying that
this doesn't work for me so you can't have it and your identity is not valid i think for me it further
clarifies the fact that i'm in the right place for me and that they're in the right place for them
like it's not that estrogen is a terrible thing to have some people really enjoy it some people do
well on it i'm not one of those people but if katie montgomery if febe if arden if they benefit
from estrogen i'm happy for them i'm very happy that they have something that like that estrogen isn't
going to waste that somebody benefits from the hormone that that made me want to die every day
i'm happy that somebody benefits from it and and that should be the approach that i think it should be
like a spot there should be a like a spot program where you just like yeah i wish but like if if if the
cis community could jump on this and and instead of taking somebody else's experience and using that to
hate them like you can use that experience to further validate yourself and say yeah i'm not this person
but that's okay they're a good person i'm a good person i'm happy with who i am i like where i'm at
and i'm also happy that they're happy with where they're at like you don't have to hate somebody
to make yourself feel better like in fact i felt the most joy from supporting other people
in finding out who they are i felt so happy doing that with them and going on these transition journeys
with my friends who might have different transitions from me so i wonder too like and i'm not
saying that this is true for everybody who are transphobes but like if you need to take
someone else's experience and hate on them in order to validate your own experience i'm not convinced
that you're happy with your own experience like what do you need to change to be happy with yourself
and maybe work on that instead of hating on somebody else in in there and i'm not saying that like
you need to just like buy into whatever somebody's ideas are because like if someone's happy in
anti vax like that's something that they shouldn't be but that's also not based on that we're talking
about they should go have a long hard look at themselves yeah yeah but but for trans people
or we know that the evidence is in their favor we the data's in we know trans people exist we know
that that transitioning helps people like instead of taking valid medicine and hating on somebody
for receiving care for for their own well-being like you can focus on your own and maybe you'll
be happier maybe everybody will be happier and i don't know people can be less assholes around
each other and that maybe would all be better yeah i love um this is what i love about you ben is
because you you seem to be able to wrestle with these these um talking points i said this to um
to shan q when she was on um she i i mentioned that i get worried that that there are you know
you get nine bad faith questions that's like something right i don't know like what's a what's a
stupid question you hear that's bad faith all the time like um um i don't know something right
were you there oh yeah yeah something like that yeah yeah something like that but like
in regards to transgenderism um or transgender um and they have um and then you have one person
who's actually heard these talking points from bad faith actors who was who is genuinely asking the
question this question that seems bad faith but isn't um and then they get yelled at or not yelled
at but they get like attacked because it's not the trans gender person's responsibility to defend
themselves wherever they go but they're like you know it's just like fuck off essentially um and
then as a result that they turn around and the alt right is there with open arms saying we told you
those those green head um feminist transgender people like they're all you know come here we told
you that they're crazy and the and the alt right is there with open arms and i think a lot of what
you're seeing a lot of the hate that you're seeing is people um being triggered by clips uh like
online clips of like lefties and it's the same thing for you know like i i said alt right i'm that's
that's me projecting my how i'm a little triggered at the dumb racist alt right people but i'm sure
there i'm sure there are some people on the right who are good people that's a bit of a joke but
i'm sure there are some people you know i think that if you set everyone down in the room and
they're talking about things like a lot of people would be more agreement than less agreement but i
think everyone is just reacting to each other and as a result that's where this hate comes from
it's like misdirection um a lot of the time not all the time but a lot of the time i would say um i hope
i hope that makes sense um yeah yeah no i'm i'm gathering where you're coming from and this is
why we have shows like the transatlantic call in show and because we get the majority of people
that call into that show are are in good faith and i will always assume that you are in good faith
until you prove me wrong um there are certain things that will that will prove me wrong in that
certain dog whistles certain dishonest arguments where people you can tell people are trying to make
you angry or people are just trying to argue with you um but for the most part i assume people are
just trying to learn and so i'll try to approach it very gently from the beginning and i understand that
people don't know all the the new information people don't know these arguments they're they're
seeing them for the first time and they don't know how to engage with it so my usual approach
and and even for people who might ask more invasive questions um typically most questions i'm
fine answering depending on the the setting if i'm on a show that is platforming um like you can ask
trans people questions absolutely if i'm on a show that is advertising this is the the topic feel free
ask ask your questions don't feel bad about it um like be tactful in terms of like maybe don't
go to my dms and dm me very specific questions maybe don't walk up to me on the street and ask me
very specific questions because i have boundaries for where i i answer certain questions but for the
most part even if somebody oversteps a boundary that wasn't clearly communicated to them before i'm
just going to i'm going to assume that they just didn't know and my usual approach is hey i'm okay
answering this question for you but maybe in the future um some other people might be offended
by this question so uh i would recommend that you ask for consent first or that you direct
that your question to this platform or or something like i i try to be gentle in recommending
like number one a good source of information that it will be happy to answer the question
and then also clarifying that hey this question might not be appropriate for everybody so just be
careful that because somebody else might not want to talk about um something more personal or
they're coming out story not not everybody wants to to mention that so and and i don't think that
everyone is that is asking for these questions means them harm but just yeah just trying to
to clarify like i know you mean well i know you just want information i'm happy to talk to
here's some other names of people that might be also be happy to answer here's the email address or
link where you can send your questions uh and then if you want to know more just be careful in
entering conversations with other people this is how it might be read and and hopefully it's just
a learning experience from there so um i know yeah it's some people might be taken aback by any
kind of feedback i know some people are are very sensitive to feedback but i don't mean it in
in a harsh way at all and i hope that it doesn't come across that way um unless of course if you
if i can tell you are using a dishonest argument to make me angry then like like you had said if
someone starts being dishonest with you all bets are off like we're gonna start we're gonna throw
down yeah and usually that's on live call in shows where i see that or it's on twitter so those
platforms those platforms yeah no all bets are off but but for the most part people have been
good about it and i'm not going to slam somebody into the ground when they just wanted clarification
i don't think that that's the right move for anybody i think if any trans person or whatever
they have full right to say that they don't want to answer a question and i fully respect their
boundaries but that's a case where on a day where i don't want to answer a question i would probably
just say hey i'm not in a good space to answer this i i don't really want to do this on this platform
here's where you can direct the question to but i can't imagine like like you know every second day
someone's asking about like my generals or like something like it i can't even fathom me like
or like i just can't i can't fathom like having my kind of existence question that much um
like all the time um like my identity it must be tiring and that's why it's good that you put
up like boundaries like i'm not going to talk about this to some random person on my dms or to
you know down the street or something um but i do want to ask you did you have have you had a moment
um where you just felt like baller in your own body where like maybe you went to the beach you
took your shirt off and you were just like yes or like maybe i don't know like or like you like you
just felt like yes i am in the body that i want to be in or are you still working your way there or
like what you know have you you looking forward to the experience like what where i'm i'm working my way
slowly but surely but um my muscle mass has increased dramatically since i started and a lot
of it has been passive um but something that was big for me is that there's a lot of rhetoric
especially around trans people in sports which that's a whole separate topic but um a lot of
the rhetoric behind trans men is that anyone assigned female will never be able to match somebody
who's born male that's the rhetoric and it's inherently misogynistic because that's not true
there's overlap with anybody there are women that will beat men at whatever sport that's it's true
people are individuals and um so i training brazilian jujitsu i started in 2016 so i was
presenting female totally like pre transition didn't even know as trans
competed in women's divisions and recently i started training again in jujitsu with
which i mean a lot of my time off has been related to med school and not necessarily to the
fact that i'm trans but i went back recently and at this new gym nobody knows that i'm trans
nobody so it's been great to just be like hey i'm entering this nobody's misogynistic to me
it's just they see me as a dude with experience that's it and i get on the mat with somebody
probably double my size uh for for some first first to score points and it was is great like i'm
i didn't wreck him by any means we're the same skill level but with a size difference like i held
my own with this guy on the mat like and he's double my size and that's it's a trend you see in
all of jujitsu where the smaller you are generally uh it takes longer to learn because you're constantly
up against big people that just smash you for no reason but your technique gets solid because
you're constantly against people that are bigger than you is stronger than you better than you that
you learn how to do it well and so nobody knew that i had only competed in female divisions
nobody and nobody cared but i held my own against this guy double my size because my technique was there
and my strategy was there and my physicality was there like i was doing it so that was something
that was very affirming to me that like my past doesn't define who i am like i can do things
just as well as as any other man can so i think i think that's my best example so far that's awesome
that's awesome i i don't know like i haven't looked too much into the um
the trans sports issue to be honest mainly because i don't care about sports um myself but um
one thing that i did remember i used to make video games i used to love making video games
i had a youtube channel when i made video games um uh and i'll teach people how to make video games
and one thing that i learned from a talk was it was essentially that sports is stupid
because they're they're based on genetics at the highest levels right like i'll never
there's no way i'll never be a pro basketball player i'm just not tall enough i i there's nothing
i could do to fix that there's nothing i could do to change that it's like at the top level my genetics
cap me and the same with likes you know i can never be a rock climber i'm short you know like i don't
have a good reach i'm short and i'm heavy you know so i mean the heaviness i could change
with the low reach i could change so when it comes to like the top fields of sports like it's it's
kind of like this masturbatory genetics game anyway it's like what's the best you know like it's
it's almost like you know finding people with that can reach that that upper potential we olympic potential
and then giving them the correct training so it's like to me it's it's all a bit of a
masturbatory like taking it yeah and in the um you have some financial advantage in there too
because if you have somebody who can spend their entire day training their sport instead of having to
work a job that adds more to it like there's so many variables to what makes a good athlete
in whatever sport that it's not it's never going to be fair it never was fair so to claim that
like you needed it to be fair for everybody across the board no you didn't
so it's it's an it's a fallacious argument from the get go it's it's not the
look and i could be wrong about this but it seems as though you know if a man if a biological
man goes through puberty they probably have a bigger skeletal stuck structure and muscle mass and
things like that even if they do start taking hormones and transition they might be at a slight
advantage or something so the data shows that it's because it's based on fat free
lean mass okay is what the studies are showing and and so if you took people of the same height
and weight um and and muscle mass like they're gonna perform equally so like the biggest issue
yeah people get freaked out people get freaked out about well well but we can't have Brock Lesnar
in the rain with uh Misha Tate well they're two different completely different body sizes
they would never be in the same weight class but yeah take wrestling or brazilian jiu-jitsu or or boxing or whatever
you take a a cis woman who's 135 pounds and you take a cis man at 135 pounds which is small
for for a lot of cis men but the point is when you normalize for size that's a fair that's a fair match
so so what i is what you're saying is if we had better ways or like if we measured things more precisely
and put people together based on muscle mass it would be a fairer well it's it's sport dependent
like if if you can take the data that says these factors uh make for different skill in the sport
then maybe you make categories based on that characteristic like even if you just made it skill
categories or or size categories height categories it's gonna be more localized than that and sure you
might have more cis women on the lower weight class spectrum but that's fine like and we see this in jiu-jitsu
children in jiu-jitsu compete co-ed like it's not until they hit puberty puberty is when they start
gendering jiu-jitsu oh okay yeah so yeah so so if you say that that makes that makes a lot of
sense but i guess my point is that is arbitrary and so is all the other categories in sport it's it's
essentially not categories i just i just what i don't like about sports is this masquerading of like
this person put in the work and they like they you know and they train so okay sure of course you
did like it's like it's like someone takes steroids and then gets huge it's like of course like when
you're on steroids you you train harder than you've ever trained in your life i'm sure it's like
one of the most brutal things that you've ever put your body through but you still got that big
because of the steroids the steroids still played a major part in that whole endeavor so it's like your
genetics play a huge part in the upper levels of like your your upbringing where you grow up your
genetics like it's all i wish but once again and i'm rambling a little bit sorry once again it's
similar to what you were saying before about how people want to take like a simplistic approach to
gender and i think people do the same thing with sports it's just like you know men should be with
men and women should be with women it's like you know why what's your reason yeah exactly it's
it's like to me to me it's just arbitrary and that's to me i've been quoted in saying my my greatest
fear in life is that my children will be into sports and that's a bit of a joke but but yeah
i'm not a huge sports person obviously um but um i do enjoy kicking a ball around with something
you know but well and something like along this like with trans men um like it's this belief that
women or anyone assigned female is inherently worse and i've seen this argument before is that
trans men will never beat cis men because they're physiologically inferior which a lot of these
arguments fail to address like sure there is the genetic difference in elite athletes versus
a casual athlete like they're they're more genetics that come into play whether you are a man a woman
whatever like again i i dare any cis man uh that is not an olympian to get in the pool with
katie ladecki and try to beat her time like good luck like you being a man is not going to make you
katie ladecki and swimming so her being a woman is not what is inferior about her uh so it's an
argument meant to suppress people that they deem to be female and and they're eliminating the
factors of training and strategy and timing and preparation and all that which which play into your
performance like if you take two athletes of whatever variety and they're both equal skill level
equal size equal strength everything else is equal but one person had a bad day and one person had a
good day the person with a good day is probably going to win and it's not because of some physiological
advantage but somebody had a good day their timing was good like there's a reason why you don't do
one fight and then say i'm forever better than you you have to fight multiple times because
your first fight might not be indicative of every other fight after that and like people don't
seem to process that there is no inherent better there is yeah this time or other times
and there are multiple multiple factors that play into somebody's winning of a tournament
so yeah i agree that makes sense but so would you agree though i i'm i don't know i'm not making
any affirmative statements here i'm just asking it is so would you say though like if we match for
muscle mass that's all good but for men for biological men to get up to that muscle mass is
much easier than for a biological female would that be accurate but but then you apply that rhetoric
to sports that are not related to the muscle mass necessarily so like people could say well
for weightlifting this is an advantage and yeah like i agree testosterone does give you
some advantage for for lean muscle mass but then to say you are superior in this one aspect of
physiology therefore skeet shooting should be gendered because of muscle mass you can't extrapolate
those two points and and other things people completely disregard other physiological advantages
like people see muscle mass as being a strength which it is but disregard anything that could be viewed
as feminine from being an advantage so things like flexibility or agility or even their studies
showing that women or like cis women and people assigned female have advantages in endurance sports
largely due to their fat mass because uh we know that endurance sports rely on
the citric acid cycle and beta oxygen oxidation of lipids so people that are able to concentrate
lipids uh that are available for metabolism by muscle and the larger concentration of type
two muscle fibers are going to have advantage in endurance sports so cis women are actually
at an advantage in endurance sports and in things like gymnastics in things with with some more agility
flexibility but those aren't seen as strengths for whatever reason and i think it's it's misogyny
it's people view flexibility as feminine and so it's not desirable so i don't i don't notice but
is so is the best so are the best gymnast in the world are they female or and the best
um endurance athletes or i can't say that the best like in in general but there is like a trend
there's an advantage there is there are studies done for endurance athletes and
women versus men and specifically related to to fat mass and that is that is what we're seeing and
i can't say for sure that this is a causal thing um because because the research is still being done
but that's that's what we're seeing so it's and something that saying that one body type is ideal
for every sport is fallacious because it's not true there are sports that that favor different body types
and so that's where like the the trans people in sports conversation needs to be had at a
sport level uh with regard to their policies so it's i'm not saying that there needs to be a
standardized everything and and again and that also needs to happen at the elite level versus
like the school level uh if you have children like if your 10 year old kid is on a co-ed soccer team
like why do we need to stop trans people from playing the fifth grade soccer it's that's a bit
ridiculous like just let the kids play at the elite level it should be a sport by sport basis
on what is acceptable but you also have to again consider that cis people might fall outside
of that bracket so if let's say if you set a requirement your estrogen levels or your testosterone
levels must be within these parameters you have to then disqualify cis women whose testosterone
falls outside of that range and we're seeing that with olympic athletes even we're seeing people
that are people are wanting to have disqualified for high t levels in cis women so where are you willing
to draw the line if you're going to have these definite boundaries where is the line drawn and who
are you excluding because you're going to exclude people that's interesting so it's like yeah so it's
like you're going to exclude people regardless so it's like it almost gets like philosophical like
who do you like why do you choose to exclude this group not this group like do we want an equal
society we want a non-equal society do we want to produce it's interesting it's an interesting
conversation um it'd be interesting to look more into this and to have another conversation about it
because um obviously i'm i just my my go to is sports is stupid don't take it so seriously
but that's wrong because sports aren't stupid but obviously i'm just not a huge sport fan
it's just it's just a nuanced conversation and and we got to take this conversation to a
nuanced level and not just black and white men or women yeah exactly um so we're actually like
we've been talking for ages and i know we would have fun yeah i mean i've been i've been enjoying it
but um we could go for hours more because i got so many other questions but i want to
i think maybe what we'll do i don't know if you'll you'll come back on but if you
do i will be happy to come back on like this is you inviting me back on i just hit me up
well awesome yeah like we'll have to have a round two because um there's so much of the stuff
you go into and we just seem to i find it interesting talking to you it's we can bounce
each other really well but yeah um i wanted to do two more things um before we finish up um
i've got a list that is just i'm going to call myth or fact and it's about medicine
and okay pseudo science yeah and then we can jump into some questions yeah uh so myth or fact
so what i'll do is i'm going to tell you i'm going to say something and you just tell me if it's
myth or fact or how mythical or how fact right there's a lot of these most of these are topics
from videos that i haven't had a chance to watch yet on your channel so if people
and this actually would be a good time to mention that everyone should go subscribe to student
dr ben um for sure you produced i don't know why it's doing that you produced some of the
some of this amazing content on like medical myths um you had a really big episode on
bottom of sea i thought that was yeah if you go to the lives you'll be able to see the
more of those content i yeah my lecture videos are a bit more intense with the science and then
the medical myths is a bit more lighthearted usually in terms of the content is fentanyl killing air
cops functional medicine the truth about cannabis featuring secular rarity um routine infant
circumcision featuring nate like it's just like i love that you take these like um why did god create
cancer featuring jenna oh i love jenna this is one of my favorite people these are all great people
i'll have to get you on and since you just invited me on on to your show live uh i'm happy to
extend uh and invite to you as well and i'm happy to move to an australian friendly time i've had
one other australian on my show before almost a doctor has been on before and i woke up early
for that show so i'm happy to wake up early for an australian
well i'm sure we'll work something out um i don't mind doing it um at whatever crazy hour um
but yeah i'd love to come on your show and we can talk about i'm sure we can find something
that's um um tangent oh yeah you picked the topic let's go well uh i i am a huge advocate for
antidepressants which is interesting because you don't hear a lot of people who are like that not a huge
advocate i just like to tell my story in that they work very well for me
like very well for my ocd um so but you never hear that story you always hear the horrible story
um anyway yeah i'll have to come on your show we can talk about stuff yeah we also uh just to mention
we have a couple cool episodes coming up on deep drinks um we have russell manza who was in jail
for 23 years um uh robbed banks and things like that and now he's reformed and he's like
he's helping criminals get reformed and it's going to be a really interesting story
big criminal in australia um back a few many years ago we've actually got footage of him robbing banks
which is crazy uh but he's a really cool guy and we're gonna have a virgin uh because he's sober now
we're gonna have virgin uh mojitos i think they are um oh nice and then we have escaping the
armish cult cult that mountain do zero yeah so apparently when when he left the armish cult
he tried um mountain dew for the first time and he just loved it um so he's like a really strong
christian now but he's like standing back against the the armish cult and there's like this thing's
like murder um you know all incest um crazy just just crazy child abuse like all the stuff he
talks about uh and then we're gonna end the year and i don't know if this will become a yearly
tradition but the derrick knows everything christmas special because derrick interviews so many people
friend of the show and uh we're gonna ask him everything he knows about everything um to do with
you probably biblical scholarships and it'll be i think derrick showed up in a side chat earlier
yeah he did yeah i saw that uh and if people like to listen to deep drinks they can listen to it
on the way to work just search deep drinks on podcasting platforms but um let's just get the
banner back and you can see uh whoop i know what's going on here sorry the banner here we
can see once we get to 1 000 subscribers we're doing a charity stream which would be cool and
coming next year i wasn't sure if i was gonna mention this but i think we're gonna mention it
now um i'm we're gonna we're gonna be having a deep drinks panels so not just the podcast so
we're going to have one hopefully about iran i'm talking to some journalists at the moment to talk
about about uh we're gonna have nuri akhan on holy humanist and a few other people um who are
protesting the stuff that's happening in iran and women's rights so it'll be good i want to do one
on purity culture i've got a lot of really cool ideas to come up and have a panel of guests on
um so yeah that's that's cool things happen to deep drinks you want to subscribe and you
want to go subscribe to student dr ben but let's do myth or fact ben um let's do it okay vitamin c will
it help you when you have a cold myth is that a full myth is that like it's it's um there's some
mixed data on that it might reduce symptoms but this is a correlation and not really evidence of
causation um if you want to to consume vitamin c when you have a cold it's probably not gonna hurt
you uh it'll be expensive p it might give you kidney stones in high doses so just watch for that
but um it's mostly myth okay will vitamin c help you beat cancer that's 100 myth okay okay i've
actually i used to think that i used to watch like a lot of those like documentaries about the
pharmaceutical industry and how natural medicine and i got really hooked into it at one time um but then
i recently found out that like with some cancers you what you don't want to boost your immune system
because it actually helps the cancer cells grow because it gives them and i was like what like
i don't know how true that is either but it's like it's like a typical example of like
what you told is exactly the opposite of what you should be doing um i don't know yeah there's no
evidence at this time that suggests that vitamin c uh cures cancer okay detoxing diets
uh that's a myth that's a myth okay uh you don't need that because your liver and your kidneys
and your lungs will do that for you you don't need a detox okay all right i can see so many people
getting angry in the comments i'm not like not in the live comments but i can see go watch my channel
they can they can watch it exactly and a lot of these videos uh um uh subjects in like a full
hour long live episode where you go through the studies uh is gluten bad for you if you don't have
celiacs no okay homeopathy uh absolute bunk this is a myth there's no way to justify homeopathy
being valid what if it's magic you don't you forget about magic ben it's not homeopathy is
absolute myth um is it safe to drink your pee now he wasn't going to write this one down but i
saw it it's not safe it's not bear grill says it's okay yeah the problem is and i go through in the
whole video you have to watch it but i go through renal physiology and like the first couple times you
drink your pee it might not be too problematic but the the more concentrated it gets over time
the more ammonia you build up and this is an issue and i go into the whole like concentration
of gradients of ammonia in the kidney and how that can get disrupted so um it's not a good idea
it's not what about okay this is this is this is this is gonna get this is gonna get weird um
what about like people who have like water sports finishes where they like to pee on each other
is that safe or is that not it's it's safe like yeah that's fine okay it's just not don't drink
the pee and then pee it out and then drink it again and then pee it out and drink it again because
that's where the yeah yeah okay okay um all right interesting i could ask you a bunch of other
sex questions but i'll i'll leave that um candida diet uh bullshit it's bullshit okay i grew up with
this one that was a um that was one i go really yeah hugely yeah and um yeah you know there's a
machine that that like you you touch and then it puts certain things they put certain things on
this machine and it's that it measures measures your electrical things i want to talk but i want to
talk about that because i've not heard of that before but i want to talk about not a medical myth
but apparently is an opportunistic pathogen it people can grow it um and it's it's usually grown
in people who are immunocompromised anyway so hiv patients cancer patients um are more prone
to candida infections or people with vaginal yeast infections caused by a reduction of
of bacteria in the area so it's an overgrowth of a pathogen that's already there so most people
do not have a candida overgrowth um and the way that the candida diet instructs they basically say
that all sugar uh grows candida is it's true but not true in that yes candida likes sugar
but in the amounts that you're eating on a regular day-to-day basis if you are not
immunocompromised you're really not at high risk for um candida overgrowth in your intestines
okay interesting um this uh i'll leave this one for the end magnetic therapy absolute bullshit
your blood cannot be controlled by magnets it's not true what about if you got the covid vaccine
i've heard that makes it magnetic yeah no it doesn't and watch the episode because the amount of
magnetism that they are claiming so what they did instead of actually calculating out the amount
of magnetism for them for the bracelet they took each individual magnet and then added them together
and said that the sum of the magnetism was the amount of magnetism you're getting
which was equal to 11 MRI machines which is not true you are not walking around with
11 MRI machines on your wrist because you would not be able to pull yourself off a car it's false
okay uh this is a big one um i have so i have a friend who friend of a friend who went through
who had cancer and went through dr simonshenes bicarb soda cancer treatment and the cancer
disappeared um so the this is the cancer is a fungus no cancer is your own it's your own cells
that have mutated and people that have a cancer uh remit like we know that spontaneous remission
is possible and we don't always know why because uh this is a fairly new field of study but
sometimes cancer goes away and we don't we don't have a good answer for it and uh it's not the right
answer to chalk it up to weird things like cancer is a fungus or this apple cider vinegar diet or
cannabis or whatever have you um the answer is it went away and it's great that it did we might not
know why so that's the most honest answer i can give on that that's the there's a documentary called
by vice called stoned kids and it was about brave mikaela who his parents were giving her mass she
was terminally had cancer i think i don't know if she was terminal but she had cancer and her parents
were giving her mass amounts of thc and she's still alive like 10 years later now whether or not
it was the thc or something else or it's the placebo effect or the spontaneous remission like
we need we need studies to find that obviously um but it is interesting that yeah it is interesting
yeah and there are uses for cannabis in in treatment of cancer particularly with uh
as an anti nausea medication we do use it to treat nausea in in cancer therapy but and if somebody
is terminal like i don't care what terminal cancer you have if you're terminal you should be able
to do whatever drugs you want because if you're gonna go out anyway why do we need to restrict
your fun for the last bit of your life like i i yeah i have um i have a i don't know who they were
they're a distant relative i'm pretty sure it was like an auntie or like a second auntie or
great auntie or something they lived in it was like 50 years ago or something and they lived in
they had terminal cancer and they lived in like the uk i think it was and they were going to die so
they actually they actually moved them to i think the netherlands where all drugs were legal
at the time or somewhere in europe where all drugs were legal and they gave them heroin
for the last like part of their life and they weren't like they weren't like knocked out of their
head they just had enough that they could like they were happy and laughing and having a great time for
the last part of their life didn't matter that they were going to get addicted they were going to die
and they lived the last part of their life in in pure bliss and like laughing the family and having a great
time right i i don't see why we could we couldn't have like a like a form that you sign that says hey i consent
to this at the end of my life like you could easily get around some some legal ramifications by by like
like yeah i at the i have an advanced directive that says if i am not able to live past if if my life
expectancy is less than blank i want to smoke meth and inject some heroin and drink a lot like
that should be your right to choose i should like your long term health is not relevant at that
point because you're already predicted to die within six months like if you're hospice so i don't see the
problem in letting somebody enjoy the end of their life so i mean that's just my personal opinion but
again like it's a personal consent thing like you don't have to consent to that if you say i don't want
to do that you don't have to you don't have to yeah but it's like for the people who want to
i don't see the issue here i don't it's like the it's it's the same thing it's like hey like just because
like trans people exist you don't have to transition yourself or just because gay marriage is a thing
doesn't mean you have to marry a man or marry a woman like it's like you can like if i'm gonna die anyway i want
to be happy let me die happy okay uh so jumpy got us some q and a questions aren't you had a great
question for um yeah question for ben how do you respond to people who say yeah but those are anomalies
when presented with the nuances of sex and biology yeah so here's here's my response is that um
eliminating people from the equation who don't fit your binary for the sake of keeping the binary
is dishonest in that um like you can think of any number of exceptions like let's say people who
uh have a uterus like people who are cis women who have a uterus there are obviously exceptions
in that some people get a hysterectomy for whatever reason and they cannot have children
or people get a tubal ligation or a uh they they tie their tubes they cannot get pregnant so to say
that women can get pregnant is uh false in that not all women can get pregnant because of any
number of reasons so while it's an exception it does not disqualify somebody from from being included
in the group so it's dishonest when people say a woman or let's say a man's easier to use for this
a man is somebody who has a penis so then if you're using that as your definition then
you have to say that someone who um does not have a penis let's say they had penile cancer and had to
get it removed that they are no longer a man because they had that removed so while there are
exceptions to the trend it does not exclude people from being included in that category so that's
that's my response like and if someone is going to engage with you in a in a discussion about this
that you bring that in like if you say what makes you a man and someone says my penis makes me a man
okay so if you if you went to war and your penis was blown off by a bomb for whatever
unfortunate circumstance are you no longer a man and more often than not they would say no i'm
still a man this thing just happened to me and i would agree with them so you take them them further
uh down that route and and and you get to a point where the anatomy does not determine
the gender identity and so that's even no matter how far you go down that pathway
you don't eliminate that gender identity and so that's the point that we get to
so um i definitely recommend if you engage on this topic taking a straight epistemology approach and
like because if people aren't receptive to just blanket yeah well exceptions are included because
they might not listen to you but get them to think that they made the connection and you might
improve you might win yeah yeah um great answer uh what's so what's the purpose uh sorry
um do you have to go what's the process of transitioning and do people have a different
place where they i don't know where i didn't finish that but what's the process of transitioning
like you say you say you want to start transitioning what's the process so uh i'll i think i know where
the question was going and where's the endpoint for different people is kind of where i think that
they're going oh yeah yeah yeah uh so it's different for everybody and that's what's what's
very great because you get to choose what happens to your own body and i stand by everyone's right
to choose what happens to their own body so um i'm a a binary trans man and so my my journey
has been very typical for what a lot of other trans men go through in that i came out to myself
first i i learned that i might be trans and then from there i socially transitioned so this
is a period where no medical intervention is happening at all uh and this is a completely 100
percent reversible process in i'm trying out new pronouns i'm trying out new hairstyle clothing
style maybe a new name trying different things out and then if i don't like it i can go back
and say hey this didn't work for me and then switch so so my first step was social transition
and then once i got comfortable with social transition i sought out medical transition and
i did for myself get a psychotherapist to make sure that i had appropriate mental health care
while i was going through it because i knew it was going to be a journey for figuring out who i was
and i wanted somebody to talk to while i went through that whatever happened so i did get a therapist
they were not necessary for me to get hormone therapy but i personally wanted them there just in case
i had certain things i wanted to process with them and so then i started medical transition
i went on hormones um and it gradually increases so it you don't get a full dose right away
you start off a very small dose and then you see how it goes for the first month or first even the first
three months because you don't really see a whole lot of level changes within the first three months so
you kind of go through three months on a low dose you reevaluate with your provider and say hey i like
this or i didn't like this and then you adjust from there um i liked it so i increased my dosage
and so i follow up with them every three months to evaluate where i'm at and to see if my levels
are appropriate for a cis man of of my age group and the next step for me is i'm scheduled to get
top surgery sometime in april and in fact like this is another shill but um i have a fundraiser
that i'm doing for my top surgery if anyone wants to contribute to it you can find it on my twitter
it's the uh the pin tweet there uh but for me it's absolutely i'm gonna i'm gonna post post that
yeah kind of the typical route is social transition followed by hormones and then top surgery
and then bottom surgery at least for a trans man i know for trans women it might be a little bit
different in that they have more surgeries that they often go through like they have facial
feminization surgery uh which trans men don't have to go through so many trans women that go through
ffs might do that before they go through top surgery or they might do it after that's dependent
on who they are as a person um but for a binary person that's kind of the trend that that we're
gonna follow for someone who's non-binary or for anyone that just doesn't uh want to follow the same
pathway you can undergo any of these procedures in whatever order you want and especially as an
as an adult over 18 you can consent to whatever procedures you want or don't want so you talk to your
your provider and um there's somebody else in the community i'm not gonna name names for privacy
purposes but other people who have undergone bottom surgery before top surgery and that's fine
like and if that's something that you want to do as an adult you can make that decision uh if you
want to undergo top surgery before you have hormones um that's also fine it's it's a matter of
what is priority for you and some people who are non-binary might never might never go through
bottom surgery or might never go through top surgery same thing with even binary trans men
trans men or binary trans women might never do bottom surgery because it's risky and you you face
some more uh complications potentially with it it's also very expensive so there might be
multiple reasons why someone might not choose to go through a particular therapy and that's up to you
so my my approach is like there's a general trend of what the majority chooses but
i will happily support anybody in whatever is best for them and what they consent to
awesome okay i had a friend um who lived in thailand and there were like a
a strong christian at the time they were over there doing mission work
and helping um like girls in sex slavery and things like that um that fun fact um she's one of
my best friends um and um she's now married to a lady so and not a christian so um she had
the she was the first gay wedding i ever went to i went out and bought the gayest socks i could
possibly find to wear underneath my many more shoes but um but she was saying that when she was
over there she was talking to her partner and she was who was ty and she was asking like hey this
person's clearly not passing as a lady like a lady boy was there why like it's obvious they
could just put it in a little bit more effort and they could then look like a lady but then they
don't and because obviously there are a lot of um a lot of lady boys i don't know if that's the
same but there are a lot of lady boys in thailand and um the her partner said to her well that's as
far as that person needs to go to make themselves happy so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
if they're passing or not they just needed to like go a certain they had to go a certain amount of
down the line of transitioning i guess or appearing that that way to feel happy and that's
what they did and that totally changed my friend's perspective they're like oh okay that's why
that's why you want to see someone and they're not they're they're transgender but they might not be
perfectly like i'll say quote unquote convincing right um without trying to be sound disrespectful
but it's just because it's a personal thing it's that's how far they want to go and that made
when she told me that they made so much more sense to me it's like it's a it's an it's not a
it's not trying to trick the world it's a personal this is how i want to look this is how i want to
be perceived by society and that made things a lot easier for me to understand
i absolutely agree yeah it's based on you and your happiness and
some people i know plenty of people who don't want to do every surgery and they're happy
and that's totally valid like you don't need to put your body through what you don't want to put
your body through and and i i stand for that in terms of uh being pro choice that you you should have
the final say of whatever goes on in your body and that goes for trans people too and i will support
whatever decision you think you want to make about that uh so okay um does every trans person
start with gender dysphoria is that like an innate thing in transgender not everybody does
so it's interesting there's a certain camp of trans people that will say that you require gender
dysphoria to be seen as trans and i'm not in that camp uh i know people who are trans
and who have not experienced dysphoria but they experience euphoria with a certain gender identity
and gender expression so some people say i i have neutral feelings towards being a woman
but i have very happy feelings being a man and so they might not hate being a woman but
they're not happy there and they might say i'm happier with with this presentation
and with this identity and and so not everybody's journey is the same uh i have dysphoria but not
everybody does and i will happily stand by anybody that says that they are trans whether or
not they have dysphoria because that's that's for them to decide yeah one of the things um i don't know
for now i'm just drunk and remembering parts of the documentary but one and this is related at all
but one of the things in the documentary was um they asked that person you know can you tell
what a cat is or you know like there's that book that he wrote us about being a moose or something
it's like um it's like how many documented cases do we have of people like killing themselves over
identifying as a moose like this isn't researched this isn't researched this isn't even taken seriously
this isn't a thing but how many people do we have who kill themselves because or at least
are extremely depressed or are struggling mentally because they don't fit the gender that they're in
this is well documented and this is well studied and this is there has been like transitioning shows
that there was a fact you know what i would even go as far as to say if there was like a huge majority
of people like a huge group of people who did identify as as moose or mooses or me so whatever
moose moose and and we found that giving them like you know fur implants and things made them
happier than go for it i don't care like whatever but that's not what's happening and that and that's the point
yeah um i have to hold myself back from ranting when i get this drunk um yeah what advice would you
give to someone who um what what advice would you give to someone as someone who is transitioning
to someone who's thinking about transitioning yeah uh it's it's difficult to really work in your head
whether or not you want to transition for someone if you've already reached the point
to say i want to but insert whatever factor here whether it be oftentimes it's a social
factor of i want to transition but i am scared of what being trans will do to me um and that's
something that i dealt with was i i want to transition but i am scared of being seen as trans
i'm scared if it goes in a way that i don't want it to go i'm scared of harassment i'm scared of
of being ostracized from my family and those are reasonable fears um my thought is if you already
know that you'd be happier doing this then do it um and and in fact with social transition you can
always go back you you are not ever committed to uh socially transitioning one one way or another
and if you want to say hey i want to try out some they them pronouns or she her pronouns or he
and pronouns go for it and if you have friends that are are good friends they will not hate you if you
decide later to say hey i i don't like these pronouns can we go back to what i used before
like if you have real friends they're they're not going to hate you for trying something
to better yourself um so it's actually social transition yeah go for it it's actually it's
actually funny so i've gotten to the habit of using they them for everyone right like or or even when
i i've got a gaming channel um and you know no one subscribes and no one cares and no one watches
but when i play it um i'll say like um i'll catch myself saying all right boys we're gonna and then
i'm like and then i'll change like all right folks because i want to be inclusive because like
you know especially in the gaming and part of the world women that like just shit on so i'm
trying to like be more inclusive there but what's funny in the introduction um i had a bunch of like
they's and them's in the um introduction when i was introducing you and i'll actually have to go back
i was like no and i changed the he and him and his um in in the um introduction because i was like
this is funny this is like the opposite case of where i try and be inclusive all the time but
i was like no no like the whole point of this is that ben is a he him like so i actually went back
and changed so it's funny how like um i caught myself trying to be inclusive that it would have
come across as maybe uninclusive or something so it's well and yeah for people who like if you if you
do social transition and and i'm aware that some people might not be able to do a lot of social
transition before they do medical because it might be dangerous to only social transition um
so there's a myth that is perpetuated as well well there's a there's a myth that's perpetuated by the
a lot of transphobes where you will instantly have physiological changes with hrt which is false
it takes weeks to months to get any kind of result from hrt and especially estrogen takes longer
on average for physical changes than testosterone does and i'm i'm a year and a half uh on on t and
my voice has changed my muscle mass has changed but there's still like i don't have i don't have facial
hair i can't grow a lot of facial hair that typically comes in like between two and four years on t so
the lie that are you gonna do you think you're gonna grow big my family doesn't grow a whole lot
but they can grow mustaches so this is growing in more than this is but we'll see what happens
but do you think what i'm saying is do you think do you think you're gonna rock it like
you think you're gonna like let it i hope it i hope it happens if it happens i'm growing it but
i mean until i go active duty military uh in july in which case i will have to shave every week but
yeah um but like if you if you honestly think to yourself that you want to do hormone therapy
you can you can do it without necessarily committing to the long-term changes uh in that like
i was afraid of this when i first started that in the first week i was going to get irreversible changes
and it's not true so uh it took a while for me to get any kind of results from it apart from the mental
confidence boost which was great that was immediate but if you want to try hormones
it's it's pretty risk-free for a good period of time so if you want let's say you're assigned
mail and you want to try estrogen you could do estrogen for a few weeks and see how it makes
you feel emotionally before you get any kind of physical changes so you can decide for yourself
there you're not condemning yourself to irreversible changes by doing hrt so if you really are
considering it i would say go for it and over the first two to three weeks if you don't like
what you're getting even over the first week if you don't like how you feel on it you can stop it
no one's gonna make you do it longer than you want to so that that's my recommendation if if you
want to try it then try it and know that it's temporary if you want to stop at any time uh once
you get longer like for for trans guys voice changes start happening at the earliest about a month
and it's a very minimal the farther you go the the more irreversible the changes are to your voice
so know that if you want to try it maybe a few weeks versus a few months for reversible changes but
try it try it and then and then you can always stop
okay to be honest the explosive orgasm thing we said before makes me want to try tea
well and i mean oh well and and for cis guys like a lot of cis guys have low t levels so i've
actually heard that it's like it's like it's like 40 percent uh it's very common like 40 percent yeah so
yeah that's um i don't know if i have like t levels um but um just you can always get a measure
like the word explosive orgasm just will not get out of my head um
so we didn't talk too much and maybe we can say this a bit for more of another another time but um
but you did mention like you eventually deconstructed your faith you're no longer
a believer in christianity um or in god um so i got two uh questions that i always ask people
on this channel so what if anything would change your mind specifically on the god belief on the god
belief um it's it's hard to specifically say what specific thing um but if somebody could prove a
causal relation between god and whatever the fuck is going on here on this planet um which there's
a lot of things you could like literally any causal relation if you could prove a causal relation
and not just a correlation i would consider i would reconsider
okay but i need math for that
you gotta feel it bro you gotta feel it that's the that's what i i need i need some math i need some
i need some other i need you to also exclude i need to find some way to exclude hallucination
from the differentials so yeah you can demonstrate causality and uh prove that it wasn't a hallucination
which is difficult to do then you know i'd reconsider um okay and last question um
is what is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in oh god i don't know
uh well okay well actually no um of the religions in the world like i
and again this might be a cop out because i don't believe in deities i don't believe in any deities
but uh zen buddhism is probably the closest to correct because of the lack of god claim yeah
yeah everyone says that everyone says that um so just wrapping up quickly i i do
want to mention that i really thank you for coming on um deep drinks ben this isn't a safe space for anyone
because we have deep conversations this is the disclaimer i put up um we have deep conversations
i'll talk to people about almost anything um as long as it's done responsibly um so uh
but i and i think that you know i i i always um put the right title on these videos so people
have a choice in whether or not to to have to join in these conversations or watch these conversations
because i realized that deep conversations sometimes aren't just like a um a perfect spot but
what i what i really appreciate is you coming on anyway and deciding to have this conversation um uh
and and but what i want to say is that although this place is in a safe space and i'll give
everyone i'll talk to christians or talk to people who i find morally reprehensible i want to
say personally that i'm an ally i've got green war my ally shirt i'm a um ally i love my trans
people i love my members of the lgbt community it was soft spot in my heart for them especially
because one of my best friends colon first episode of deep drinks spent 45 years closeted um so
although this isn't a safe space for everyone this is but we have deep conversations about all
sorts of topics that can be hard for people to listen to i just wanted to say that that my personal
perspective is that and also i wanted to shout out your fundraiser for your top surgery as well
i appreciate 2444 dollars raise of the 10 grand so guys let's get let's let's let's push that
number up a little bit um for the people watching um it'd be great to see you get to that $10,000
goal um be awesome to see uh so thank you so much ben for coming on deep drinks it's been
it's been really cool getting to know you man and um i'm there there is a panel that i'm supposed

going through a um it's super interesting it's on your channel as well right where we're going through
a purity culture book um yeah but but what you went through back before you transition so
you're coming from the perspective of like what the the gender norms came on like we'll push on to you so
yeah yeah so uh i'm gonna be on that hopefully uh if i can if we line up time but i'm i've got
there i've got the book ready to go and i'm super excited for that uh so thank you so much for
