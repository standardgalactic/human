Like, when's the first complete, I guess, copy of Mark?
Or how late is that?
We can cobble together almost all of Mark based on the manuscripts
and then the quotations from the patristic authors by about 300 CE.
But we don't get a full copy until we get to what are known as the Great Unseals.
So Sainadikus, Vaticanus, Alexandrinus.
And these are mid to late fourth century into the fifth century CE.
But we have, and there are some manuscripts that include the majority of these texts.
So I think we can probably account for pretty much everything by the third century CE,
but we don't have a single manuscript that contains everything for Mark or Matthew
or whatever until probably the fourth century CE.
