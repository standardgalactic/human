Anybody who has autism or has read about it is aware of like, when we say we love
rules, we don't mean we love being controlled quite the opposite.
We like the predictability of this input equals that output and for
there to be consistency, because most things, which are true, have that consistency.
And so at some point, the sort of like asking questions and getting answers of
like, you don't need to know the answer or something that's just so incompatible
with anything that's logical or reasonable, it wouldn't surprise me if autistic
people are more likely to leave religious belief or maybe leave earlier than
other people because the inconsistency and the incongruence.
