What is the most plausibly true religion that you don't believe in?
I have a lot of appreciation for Islam, and something that struck me while watching Muslim
debaters was when they were going after Christians on the Trinity, right? Now, I have a list of
reasons that I disagree with Islam that are honestly very similar to some of the reasons
that I have objections to Christianity. But, dear Lord, when I see Muslims and Christians
debating, does the Muslim win damn near every time? So as a result, I've wound up having just
like a lot of appreciation for Islam as a result of that.
