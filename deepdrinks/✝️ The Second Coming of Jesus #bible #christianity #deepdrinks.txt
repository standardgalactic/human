Did you know, Jesus was supposed to have returned by approximately 60 CE?
Well, that's at least what he told his disciples.
In Matthew, we find Jesus warning his disciples about future events.
Wars, earthquakes, famines, false prophets, the sun and the moon will be darkened, stars
will fall from the sky, then BAM!
Just as things are falling apart, Jesus returns on the clouds with an army of angels at the
sound of a loud trumpet call.
When the disciples ask him when will this happen, Jesus tells them, truly I tell you,
this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
The same story is repeated two more times in Mark and Luke.
This is huge because if Jesus is telling the truth, he should have returned 2,000 years
ago.
