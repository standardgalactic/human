A group of Christians called the Elk sites
The Elk sites were living in the Persian Empire. So they're not they're not Roman Christians. They're Persian Christians
they believe
that Jesus
After he ascended into heaven, he became a 14 mile wide angel
14 miles he's so big that when he comes to earth, you'll be able to see him from space and he has a sister named
The Holy Spirit I can't remember it might be Zoe but it might not
But he has a sister Holy Spirit who is just as big as him and there's these two giant angels in the sky that are 14 miles long
