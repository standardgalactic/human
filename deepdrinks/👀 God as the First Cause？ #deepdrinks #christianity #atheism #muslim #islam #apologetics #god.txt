I didn't even know what question to ask in order to find the answer like they will say that God is
the necessarily like starting point you know like that God created the universe and otherwise we
get into an infinite regression but it's like well why say that God created the universe when we
can just say like who created God I believe the universe came from the same place you believe God
came from and that is he and then you think if there is a God how does he not know something's
above him like the way we don't know we don't know something's above us why doesn't this God know
something's above him
