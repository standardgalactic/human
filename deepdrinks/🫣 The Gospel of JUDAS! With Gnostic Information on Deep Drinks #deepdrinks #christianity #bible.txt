There's also a Gospel of Judas, and Judas gets told beforehand,
listen, man, there's going to be 12 disciples, you're going to be called the 13th,
and they're all going to hate you and they're going to impose you for the ages.
But you are doing the most important job and you have to do it.
So Judas knows this secret knowledge and he has to go through with it.
