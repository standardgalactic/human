their view of the Roman providence theory in the New Testament and why Rome is all
over it and stuff like that. Well I have a special treat, the gentleman that we've
been talking to about Israel only is gonna join us, Jason DeCosta, how are you doing Roman?
I'm doing good man, how are you? I'm doing great, I'm doing great. I'm so thankful
that you actually came on here bro, to be able to share with us this view
because my opinion is this view is a very intelligent one and what I mean by
that is it takes things, you have to be able to grasp certain concepts and to be
able to have definitions understood, you have to have a vast knowledge of Old
Testament connecting to the new, to be able to get this thing and I have not
fairly represented this thing before scholars such as Robert and Christ, I
wish I had the opportunity to talk to Christ, to be able to explain this better
and I'll be honest I listened to your last show, your response to creating Christ
Guys and I did not fully get what Io was until I listened to that entire two
hours and fifty minutes and I said you know that makes a lot of damn sense man
so I thought why not bring him on here and let the horse speak for himself and
and do it so so I wanted to say first off how can people, what's the best way
people can get a hold of you? Yeah I mean I'm not on Facebook, I left for various
reasons a couple years ago and it just was not a healthy situation for me to be
on there plus when I came to Io I kind of ran for the hills because I knew I was
about to get stoned, you know I'm not there but people can reach me at my
email address which is my initials JD at R-G-P-E-R-G-O that's rogergeorgepaulergo.com
and or they can come to my YouTube channel and you know contact me there
I am at they can just search for you know my name Jason DeCosta Israel only and
I'm sure that'll pull up so those would be the main two ways and if there was
somebody who really wanted to chat about this stuff I usually try to find time
to you know do it over the phone and whatnot. Guys check it out if you're
watching this go down in the description I'm gonna have the link to his YouTube
channel right down there you guys go subscribe like listen to this stuff I
have to admit this is a very intellectual position I will I really
would like to see scholarship especially these guys are far more brilliant
than I Dr. Robert and Price Dr. Richard Carey. Yeah wouldn't we love to see some
of these guys actually see say you know what were these New Testament guys
doing because they knew they knew the Old Testament but we'll get into that and
I'd like to talk some more about that but first I have an important question I
think it's important people understand where you're coming from how the hell
did you get where you're at right so give us some background tell us a little
bit about yourself your history how you got into the Bible in the first place.
Yeah man for sure so I'll start out by saying I'm not a Christian just so
people know I Christianity at least two years ago roughly roughly two years ago
if I had to classify myself and where I stand today I probably I probably
wouldn't consider myself an agnostic certainly not an atheist but but not an
agnostic in the sense that I did have an experience that sort of changed me in
transformry a bit so I wouldn't be able to put myself in an agnostic category if
anything I would have to kind of go towards maybe like a warm deist who
believes that God does exist in some form whoever wherever whatever and he
chooses in his own will to interact at his own pace if he interacts at all you
know I find it kind of interesting that you know Christians think that this God
is so merciful and great and loving yet 99% of them have never even so much as
had any sort of experiential you know encounter with this God right he's just
kind of hiding out in the clouds playing hide and seek and and people are so
convinced that this is the truth so I would say I'm a warm deist where I do
believe that there is a God and that he sometimes chooses to interact for whatever
reason who knows right I don't mind me asking like just like a spirit of some
storm a universal bigger picture being of some sort possibly or energy or
something that that technically isn't exclusive only to a book called the Bible
but that is bigger that's bigger than any book okay okay I can I can dig it I
can dig it absolutely and I'm not even sold on the fact that there is just one
right I mean who really knows what's really out there you know and there's
so much information and so many possibilities that I'm not you know
gonna be dogmatic and say hey there's only one supreme sovereign God over all
creation right who really knows obviously that's the picture that the
Hebrew Bible paints but we'll get to that later but anyways my not so Christian
testimony if you will I grew up in a mild Christian home as a young boy I
attended a non-denominational church until I was maybe 12 or 13 and then I
stopped my parents were always kind of lukewarm I would say lukewarm
Christians they went to church and we prayed before dinners that type of thing
but we were far from you know religious nutjobs in high school and forward there
really wasn't any religion or thought of a God in my life I adopted kind of a
mellow atheistic viewpoint and I really had no interest or desire for spiritual
things I didn't go to church I had no Bible knowledge whatsoever I couldn't
have even recited one scripture beyond maybe John 316 just because that's what
everybody pedals right so you know I went to college after high school I
started the party lifestyle I lived very recklessly as many college kids do and
I left college a year year in I went down to University of West Florida and
Pensacola I wanted to just be here Panama City Beach man so I wasted my
parents money and went there for a year and then I left college and I traveled
back home to Rhode Island which is my hometown area and I found a job working
as a production guy for a medical equipment company I ended up taking on
the task of eventually traveling to a trade show for the company and doing
some sales in Chicago one weekend when I was about 21 years old and instantly I
was hooked I was 21 I was obviously girl crazy at the time who isn't I was
staying downtown in a pimp hotel in downtown Chicago I had a company credit
card per diem I was earning a decent living things were good right and we've
talked about this in the past oh yeah and I ended up taking on a more serious
sales role after that trip because it kind of went well for me and the company
you know started putting me on trade shows and I was doing about 30 trips per
year over the next five years and that and I still do roughly that amount but
the next five years after that from maybe 21 to 26 or 27 somewhere in that
range was just a cluster of drunken drug induced memories mixed together you
know yeah girls party rockstar lifestyle just trouble at age 27 I had my first
serious girlfriend and I say serious not because I hadn't had girlfriends in the
past but this was the first girlfriend that I actually tried you know and put
effort into and didn't cheat didn't do those scummy things that I was brought
up doing you know and so you know that was that was my first real girlfriend
and a set of circumstances ended up eventually leading to a horrific
breakup of course my fault but that's another story but this breakup really
kind of crushed me you know it was like a ton of bricks just coming down on my
back alongside of some other shit that was going on in my life it was just a
real dark period I was depressed broken confused heavy even suicidal just at a
real dark place and I know you know your story I've heard things and you know
obviously I got to give you kudos man for what you've come out of super
inspirational man you're a true testament to what you can do if you
put your mind to it so kudos on that but anyways I had a trip out to the west
coast to the Coronado Bay area in California and this was just a handful
of days after the big breakup and by this point I was really down in the dumps
I checked into a stunning waterfront resort room which overlooked the bay I
had no appetite obviously you know how you get when your heart broke and so I
ended up going to bed early to try to you know escape the pain next morning was
the morning when my world changed really and it sent me on a course for spiritual
things it was about 705 a.m. West Coast time and I woke up and I glanced over at
the alarm clock and I remember it like it was yesterday right 705 I remember
that time like it like it's nothing I woke up glanced over this was March 2nd
2011 so just over eight years ago the hotel room that I was in was bright the
sun was shining into my room through the big open windows and at this point I
hadn't cried yet I was kind of just toughing it out like I you know I got a
man up I got to deal with this pain you know no tears up until this point but
that morning when I got out of bed at about 705 I walked directly over to the
window where the sun was shining in and I just looked out and that's when the
tears just flooded you know tears just came on me and I stood there looking out
of the window and just cried and cried and cried and it was a moment of
self-reflection where I just recognized that I was at an all-time low point in
my life and I just didn't want to go on anymore you know I just I either wanted
to give it all up and just end it or I wanted to have some sort of a breakthrough
where I changed you know and I and I at that moment when I was crying I wasn't
thinking about changing I was just kind of having a pity party about my life and
the decisions I had made and sure you know I had a great job and everything but
at the same token I just felt kind of like dead you know what I mean and
and so after about five minutes or so I would say maybe ten of crying at the
window I walked over to the bed and just kind of got down at the foot of the bed
and threw up my hands and cried out to a guy that I didn't even think existed I
was desperate for relief man and that's all I that's the only way I can describe
it is that this was just something that whatever it was it led me there it drew
me there and that's the direction that I went without even knowing that I was
doing it you know yeah and I got to tell you immediately within seconds all my
pain was taken away all of it in a split second completely gone and the way that
I describe it because there really is no way to describe an event like that would
be if I use this analogy sometimes if you ever grabbed on to an electric fence
as a kid and you get sort of a zap right through your body right and and it kind
of scares you like oh shit you know but you knew it was gonna happen so you did
it anyway yeah that's exactly what it felt like it was almost like some sort
of electric currency or whatever it is that was just zapping for my body quick
it didn't last long I would say a split second if that and and it took all my
pain away and it replaced the pain so you know it's one thing to say that the
pain was removed right because you know I think for most of us time heals all
wounds for the most part but this was radically instant you know like it just
doesn't happen that way the pain was removed but what's even more amazing to
me is that what replaced the pain was pure joy ecstasy and bliss like I'd never
experienced before in my entire life so now here I am you know a kid a punk and
and I'm crying like a bitch at the window right and you know and I'm weeping
weeping weeping and I'm in pain and despair and dark and suicidal and I get
to the foot of the bed I cry out in a split second now I'm overwhelmed with
unspeakable joy right it just it just doesn't make sense so it was it was
totally unexplainable it was unimaginable and there's really no
other way to explain it besides being brutally honest and saying that I just
threw up my hands and asked for help in a moment of absolute despair and some
things somewhere answered me bro Jason you are saying my story in that moment
after the darkest deepest I was shooting up I was on heroin I was in the
depths I had no hope I had no there was no sunlight to come right and something
shined a light into my life and I cried out inside of my own mind and I said I
have helped me yeah I can't make it I can't do it and it made me able to do
it whatever the was man it cared about me whatever was it might have been my
higher conscious state it could have been some being possibly out there in the
universe it could have been collective people's energies and thoughts towards
me I don't know all I know is it really happened whatever so I agree man your
story is real I love this please keep going yeah definitely and so you know
like I said it just it was just light and fast pain was turned to bliss and I
kind of stood up and was just like in a moment of like pure awe at what had just
taken place right I was full of joy and it just excuse me none of it made much
sense to me it was very bizarre now I know people will usually don't believe
these types of accounts unless you've been there right hell I didn't believe
anything like that until it happened to me but to people who want to doubt my
account or claim that I was tired or my mind was playing tricks on me all I can
say is I just have to kind of laugh and smile and say okay we can leave it at
that because you know at the end of the day I could sit here and try to get
people to believe my experience but it really wouldn't do any good right right
it wouldn't change them and you know the only thing that would ever change
anyone is is if they had a personal experience of their own and hopefully one
day they do experience something like that because it's really transformative you
know it changes you and you know I know not to bash on them by the way I love
your show man you do an awesome job I tuned into some of them not all of them
some of them just I'm just not into but especially I like that when you have
price on I mean who doesn't right yeah yeah yeah the guys are genius although in
the midst of his rents I sometimes feel like I need a thesaurus or something
because I can't when he throws in the sarcasm it makes it even more
difficult because you're like wait a minute pause what did he just say was
brilliant guy man and you got a lot of brilliant people on there it's a cool
show yeah but I know you had a guy on the show recently and I didn't tune into
much of it because once he started saying these things I kind of was just
kind of like eh you know but he was giving an account or something of how
he when he was like a young boy he used to walk around the kitchen making
crock-pot pulled pork with Jesus or something and I do recall some crazy
claims by him you know about how he actually saw Jesus Jesus right walk
with him talk with him and you know what hey who am I to say what's really
truth it couldn't have happened maybe right but you know that sort of thing
I'm not promoting okay right right I got you right not at all someone might say
to me well why should I believe your experience when you say you don't believe
his and I get it it's a valid point but the only thing I can say is that my
experience was not a visible tangible type of experience there was no figure
taking a human shape I came into my room and sip the cup of coffee with me you
know my my experience was purely spiritual it was in the spiritual realm
something in a different realm reached down into my inner being and took the
pain away and gave me pure bliss and joy that's really all I can say and I can
only offer ideas as to what exactly it was or why it occurred but here's here's
the Christianity kind of twist to it initially when it happened my first
thinking was this is Jesus right this is Christianity because of course you know
that's what I was brought up on as a child and I have a mom and a stepdad who
are I wouldn't say sold out for Christ but you know they both love the Lord and
so all these years of me hearing like you know you've got to go to church you've
got to say the sinners prayer and stuff like that it just I think that was my
only logical next step at that point you know what I mean right and I couldn't
even think of any other option to be honest nor was I able to step back and
say you know what that could have been anything right it could have been
anything who the hell knows yeah but instead I forced it to be Jesus and I
instantly began beating people up over the head with the Bible for a time time
and half the time oh I thought I was Daniel so anyways after that I spent
about moving through different views theological theological views always
realizing that there was something kind of off and moving onward to a more
accurate viewpoint or at least trying to around three years in I discovered
partial preterism and I had a short stop there for about three weeks and then
immediately became a full prep as I had no doubt that all was fulfilled based
upon what the Bible actually states quickly Jason a lot of my audience is
not familiar with what full preterism is there are some who know a little bit but
it's sad to say that in order for us to even get to the IO it's very important
people even understand in a brief synopsis what is full preterism in
essence give a rundown if you don't mind it during this process at some point I
want to stop the story but it's important you know I mean no I'm sure I'm
going to touch upon it as I go forward but I'll give you just a quick something
quick to chew on here so full preterism is the belief that all things that the
coming of the Lord was when he said it was you know and it kind of stems from
Matthew 24 that would be kind of like the go-to point I would say where you see
the beginning where the disciples come and ask Jesus tell us you know when will
your coming be and the end of the age in other words that was kind of linked
together coming of the Lord was the end of the age and not know not the end of
the world there's no such concept in the New Testament it was the end of the
Jewish age it was the end of the law the end of the temple the end of the
sacrificial system the end of the Levitical priesthood it was when all
things hebraic history and law related came to an abrupt end and Jesus tells
them he says he well he goes through the list of things in the olive at
discourse that were going to take place in that last generation and then he
encapsulates all of these things and I believe it's verse 34 he says truly I
say to you all not some of these things not not most of them not a few but all
these things that I just got done telling you about will take place in this
generation so he's speaking to a contemporary first-century audience and
telling them hey listen all the shit I just told you it's gonna go down in this
generation right and if you backtrack to verse 14 of that same chapter you see
him say truly I say to you you know this gospel will go to all nations and then
the end will come now that's the same end that he encapsulates in that
generation so the point is is that the gospel in my opinion having come full
circle now was limited to that last generation it was a urgent imminent
message that was going out and permeating the surrounding nations to
gather in the lost sheep of the house of Israel before the shepherd came for his
sheep and that's exactly what we see kind of throughout all the epistles of
Paul and Peter and James I mean they all agree with Jesus they all preach the
same exact message and I know certain people would disagree with me on that
but to me it makes perfect sense Paul is saying hey you know live as though you're
not married because the time is short to the Corinthians Peter's saying to his
audience he's saying hey the end of all things is at hand James is saying hey the
judge is at the door you know and then when you get to the book of
Revelation of course you have some 20 some odd mentionings of soon near at hand
all this all this stuff is about to take place so the point is is that you have
this overwhelming body of textual evidence in the New Testament that says
that they not us were in the last days and that all the elect were going to be
raised on the last day and all those who belong to Christ would be transformed
and changed at his coming which again was falling in that generation so I'll
probably come back around to that but did you have anything to add to that or
to briefly give people just what you just said is this full preter's position
is a technically a temple centric if you want to know when the end was
destruction of the temple the resurrection the like culmination of
the resurrection of the dead this is happening at the temple the return or
the coming of the Lord that was at the temple so you have to have in mind
everything is wrapped around that there's a 40 year wilderness it's a midrash
concept in my opinion however I look at the text is like whoever compiled this
came after and they wrote this in such a way in my opinion I don't think it have
happened to happen before the temple that's just because I'm a skeptic about
this but but either way the author's intention is saying it's quite interesting
if you look at it because Joseph Atwell which is a total opposite guy on this but
he has an interesting point from the death and resurrection of Jesus I think
it's from the death of Jesus might have been from the resurrection I think it's
the death of the Passover from the Passover 33 to the Passover in 73 that
73 Passover is the end of the war 40 years to the day yeah the end of all
things takes place right that is a very interesting thing Jason that we even
stumbled across this and I want to say that to the audience there's no like
future into the world like he said there's no idea of actual literal
cosmological ending planet earth none of that so he's gonna touch on this along
the way I already know he will and this is gonna be interesting so he's gonna
tell you about why this is a message of preterism and the audience though has
always been the same okay and that's that's gonna be an interesting thing
to hear because that's a different take than what you've been hearing and I want
you to go ahead and keep going I don't want to stop you where you're at please
do yeah man so and one other thing that I'll add to the preterist thing before I
move on here with my not so Christian testimony I I will say that the the idea
of the final judgment in my opinion and what I'll touch on more is centered and
exclusively for the people who were under the law you know the if you think
about it I mean just logically when you think about a judgment right a judgment
can only be valid if there's a judge and if there's a law that's binding upon a
certain people right you don't have you don't go into a courtroom and have no
laws and no judge right I mean you might need to have some sort of code if you
will to abide by and to transgress in order to fall victim to a final judgment
and so when Jesus and Matthew 20 is it Matthew 20 I'm sorry what's Matthew 16
27 sorry just had a brain fart there Matthew 16 27 Jesus says truly I say
that that's just some of you standing here in front of me will not die until
you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom to reward each one according to
their works right so what were the works well I believe that Paul touches upon
this in 3 where he says as many as are under the works of the law are under the
curse right so Jesus is saying I will come and judge you according to your
works done under the law and that's what this is all about right right from the
beginning back in the book of Joshua I think it's Joshua chapter one Joshua
lays out for the people of Israel that they're to abide by every flip and word
in that book yeah right and if they didn't they'd be upshits creep without a
paddle and that's exactly what we see taking place throughout the whole story
Israel's constantly breaking the covenant and saying we don't need these laws and
you know we're engaging in idolatry so point is is that the this idea of a
universal judgment and universal resurrection and everything was foreign
to the minds of the biblical writers because to them it was it was more about
the restoration of the kingdom of Israel it was more about the promise that the
12 tribes who serve God earnestly day and night were hoping to attain and we'll
get more into that later but I just wanted to add that the wrapping up of
this whole eschatological ending in the Bible is the final judgment and to me it
was only upon the covenant people who actually had the law and had to stand
before the judge because that's what a judgment is right yeah and you're stuck
with the pickle here because if you don't concede to that then you're not
being honest with the soon time statements and if you are honest with the
soon time statements and you say it's already happened well you can't say a
cosmological ending took place so now you have to understand the meaning and
mode in which this is supposed to take place now you're redefining what you
thought you knew the elements will burn up the you know you have to kind of
redefine and understand and if you're already doing that with full
preterism then how much harder is it to redefine terms such as Gentiles in the
context of what you're about to present to us so I don't want to I'm not still
in your thunder I just want to say it's important to build this case and yeah
yeah I agree bro so yeah back to the quick test mode you wrap that up I then
you know as I came into full preterism I was so convinced with it that I
authored a book my first book it was called the Kingdom of Price and it was
published by the great inconsistent one Dr. Don K Preston and of course now he
no longer offers that on his site since my departure from Christianity as a
matter of fact the last time that I I looked for it on Amazon this was maybe
a year ago there was one copy of it available for like $850 I don't know
why that is maybe because nobody has it anymore because Preston pulled it maybe
they figured it you know supply and demand type thing but it was like $800 I
haven't checked since it's probably gone I have maybe it's not a whole half
dozen copies of it left if anybody's interested but that would be a book that
when I was in the inconsistent full prep position where I said yeah everything's
fulfilled you know Jesus already came the saints already inherited the kingdom
the resurrection already took place but we're still playing today you know what
I mean and right that book I wouldn't recommend to anybody other than if you
wanted to just get a good firm grasp on why full preterism and the time
statements and audience relevance is the real deal you know right and then from
there I wrote another book a couple of few years ago called the Genesis of
Israel which is still actually on Amazon and what that is that's basically a
collection a lot of different information some of which I'd surely
discard now but I haven't really made the effort to edit edit anything I just
don't care enough at the time of writing that one I was probably 75% convinced of
Israel only I wasn't fully there yet and still working things out but a lot is
transpired since publishing that book the book is still a good resource for
sure but I wouldn't hang my theological cap on it anymore and I probably if
anyone's interested I wouldn't really recommend buying the book I mean that's
interesting here's an author saying don't buy his book but you know it's a
book that if you want kind of a glimpse into where I was a few years ago in my
journey that would probably be a good spot for you to go but if you want the
more up-to-date Israel only full thought process just go to my YouTube
channel all the videos are free I don't run any ads so you know you can get
everything there and you don't have to pay a penny for it and also it's there's
no video it's all audio so you could listen to it in the car you could listen
to it while you're cleaning the dishes while you're getting to your house with
your wife who cares right you can listen to all my material so that that is what
I'll say about that many people have asked me to write another book on my
current view which is Israel only but right now I have no desire to do that I
also don't have the time to do it but maybe one day who knows but anyways about
18 months ago I realized that I was fully just kind of happened one day and I
was like wow that's it this this is the story you know whether or not the
story is myth or true actual fact that's the foundation of this story is
Israel you know and since then I've produced nearly 200 YouTube audios along
with maybe a half dozen podcasts and interviews kind of things and the
momentum that it's gained during this this time has been kind of cool to see a
lot of people have come aboard and I'm not on Facebook like I said but I do have
little birdies who kind of keep me up to date with the latest drama and it's
seen although I don't although I didn't come to Israel only with the malicious
intent to destroy full-brotherism it seems as though inconsistent full-brotherists
have taken a death blow of sorts since IO has come up come about you know people
have told me that their groups and on Facebook are just kind of dead and they
have nothing to really talk about anymore I mean like what do you talk about
once you realize internally that salvation was only until the lord it's
gotta be kind of tough right but anyways sorry to ramble but that's basically my
journey right up until this point you know with you bro I like that Jason I
see some I definitely don't see your journey ever ending just because you know
we've escaped that pocket-of-thought process where it was 66 books that was
cherished that was ours right we read ourselves into Israel no matter what I
mean I will admit in high school I read my first Bible I ever read through and
I was in ninth grade I began in tenth grade I finished and I was reading from
Genesis to Revelation in the King James version and dude I knew some words by the
time I got done reading that thing I almost spoke like I was reading a Bible
like I was like thou art bringing me my lunch aren't you like but I remember
there's something magical about the book though I have to admit whoever the
authors are at this point I find the Old Testament allegorical I find it
extremely mythological and allegorical that does not mean that there is not a
historical possible elements to this thing that is so mythologized and
enhanced and an allegorical and imaginary and purposefully poetic that you
wouldn't read it like you would read history not saying there isn't that
there but I could see you at some point utilizing the whole motif old to new
because we know that they borrowed stuff they don't say they borrowed it no
ancient you know culture ever said hey we got this from the Samaritans okay just
so you know but they're borrowing ideas from each other however we can't
conclude just because they're borrowing ideas from other cultures that that means
that they're now making the universal principle for everyone it's it's there
are universal myth motifs in my opinion but it's the context in which we're
looking at is an Israel story and I always ask myself how the hell did it go
from an Israel centric you're the apple of God's eye to Rome dominates the damn
thing and so that's that's a whole not their show I think I think in this show
we're gonna stick to these 66 books mostly into the New Testament you're
gonna be going back into the old stuff so just be on the lookout let's get into
the next question you don't mind can you explain to the audience what really
pushed you over the edge to Israel only conclusion because you said 18 months
ago it just happened you're like dude I just woke up was like yep that's it dude
I'm gonna stop kicking against the goads it's damn I oh yeah no well I am
that's a great question I'm gonna definitely get into that before I did
that I just wanted to make sure that your audience understands that you know
something because I know that probably many of them are of the missed
persuasion I'm in no way here to defend the Bible as being true historical facts
from cover to cover now obviously I think you and I would both agree that there
is historical fact in the Bible right I mean how would you deny it but I'm in
no way here to defend the Bible as being true historical fact the whole way
through I'm fully open to the Bible being myth in fact over the last maybe
six to 12 months of recognizing what it actually says and how the story actually
ends in my opinion which is huge I do believe that this is probably what we're
looking at some form of a myth created to insult or maybe a myth mythological
type tale created that someone was hopeful of what would happen to the
people of Israel coming back from all the places where they were you know stuff
of that nature but personally I just go where the evidence leads had you spoken
to me about two years or so ago that might have been different I may have
defended the historical accuracy of all these supernatural events mentioned in
the Bible I love it yeah but I may have grabbed onto my you know my comfort of
Christian tradition back then in whatever capacity I held to it but now
that's no longer the case I basically removed myself from Christianity all
together and I have no longer I don't have a desire to make the book about me
you know and I no longer feel the need to defend it really it's a real freeing
feeling to come out from all that shit and step into the obvious conclusion that
none of it had anything to do with me anyway I think what sets me apart from
other troops truth seekers and maybe other people that you have on the program
is my desire and attention to figuring out what the 66 books books actually say
alright specifically the New Testament as it relates to the story laid out in
the old now do I believe that only these 66 books prove will prove my very no
absolutely not in fact I'll mention a few outer biblical sources today that do
also jive with what I'm saying so I don't believe that you know hey the 66
books is everything it's everything we need to see it's everything that tells
the whole story there is a lot of just generalized themes that 66 books kind of
outlined but in terms of real specific deep detail it just it's just not there
you know so I just wanted to say that but I've placed a high emphasis on
figuring out what the story says first and although I know for a fact that I
haven't figured it all out yet I can say that I'm confident that I am headed in
the right direction based upon what's inside of the book now we can speculate
on what the story is or why it was created all day long but if we don't
understand what the story is actually saying first my opinion is that all
those speculations will most likely fall short some of them might hit just by
sheer chance but if you're not understanding the meat and potatoes of
the story and what the hell the final goal was right what the sum of all the
parts were then you know I think it's gonna fall short and to my knowledge
based upon the research I've done I haven't been able to find anybody who
has held a view exactly like mine in history surely there have been proponents
of similar views that agree with me in portions but when it comes to the full
blended view I've really found nothing you know taking the the preterous
viewpoint that it all ended at the coming which was the destruction of the
temple in the end of the age and blending that with the ironclad fact that
Jesus only came for Israel as he said and you come to a really clear and
logical perspective so again I'm not against the myth you just wanted to say
that I have no desire to defend the Bible as being your accurate fact you
know my desire is to figure out what the story is saying like any other fiction
or nonfiction book there's always a central storyline and that has to be
my goal first and foremost then once I figured out the point and the conclusion
of the story we can start to then take some shots at figuring out who wrote it
why they wrote it for what purpose and so on I truly believe that there hasn't
been many great explanations for the story to date in terms of what it
actually says of course there's boatloads of shitty ones but obviously
I'm partial to my own explanation because it makes sense to me and I'm sure
not everyone on this channel will agree and that's fine but I just wanted your
audience to understand that I'm not a quote-unquote Bible believer I'm a Bible
student in the sense that I'm fascinated with the story and figuring out how to
place its puzzle pieces I'm fascinated with how many billions of people have
been duped by this ancient book yeah that underneath all the erroneous
opinions about it in my opinion lies a pure cohesive and exclusive story about
the salvation salvation of Israel from the law Robert Price actually said this
once in a debate he said since his childhood I believe he was a Baptist
minister at one point wasn't yeah but he said since his childhood he hasn't been
able to kick the Bible aside or something along those lines you know like
in other words it there's something about it that won't allow him to kind of
just kick it out of his mind and I can totally appreciate and relate to that as
I'm sure you can hell yeah it's like it's like what the is going on with this
story man that makes people so fascinated with it and then when you start to
actually come to clarity on it and you and of course there's esoteric type
things and you had midrash before and then you got I don't know if you've
heard of remis I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right it's what is it
it's remis R-E-M-E-Z I could be pronouncing it yes I've heard of it but
what is that again so basically remis is a rabbinical technique if you will where
they they would especially in the New Testament I see it used quite a bit where
the authors will reference an Old Testament text right but they don't
reference the entire text they'll reference just a piece of the Old
Testament portion right and what they're doing is they're not saying to the
people in the New Testament era hey everything that comes along with that
text from the Old Testament is being fulfilled right now right right what
what they're said what they're doing is it's a hint it's a it's it's it's to call
to remembrance a certain principle or a certain theme that was that the the
Israelites would have been familiar with from their Old Testament text and it
sort of calls to mind something and shows what's going on in their day so I
think a lot of people come get confused on when certain texts are mentioned in
the New Testament saying oh look now I got to go back to that Old Testament and
insert every freaking thing that's in that chapter you can't yeah just won't
work so there's a lot of that stuff that's being employed in the New
Testament and I like that yeah so but you know the point here is whether it's
myth or whether it's true historical fact right down to the type of bread the
disciples it's not really the question for me nor is it my intention to prove
one way or the other my only intention here today is to line up as closely as
I can to what I believe the story actually says and then the rest of the
chips will fall as they may so I wanted to just say that first man because I
know you know some people might be thinking like oh dude he's got a you've
got a Bible believer on the show what the hell's he doing you know but I just
want to be as accurate and as honest to the text as possible and then I can start
to work out what type of myth it is if it even is you know right that's another
story yeah I like that Jason and and just to to as Luther said on the last
show to cauterize the vein on that point because I think this is very
important the idea of the Midrash technique the Rimes like you just said
it's very very to me I'm beginning to be more and more persuaded on that
methodology I mean I'm all over the place bro but yeah like I've even heard
Richard Carrier and Dr. Robert Price these guys are both saying hey
Midrash is where it's at right and I'm thinking all right is that just because
these guys are mythicists well you start looking and exploring outside of that
and you start finding it too and you're going hold on even the historicist I
recently had on with Dr. Price he said if I'm gonna be convinced of a
mythicist position yeah it's most likely gonna be through Midrash the idea
that they're reusing Old Testament motifs and reapplying them into the new
and technically could have been a whole a whole cloth creation surrounding a
historical context of in my opinion the war that was so tragic to Israel and
they had to have something good come out of it right something good that came
out of that is the salvation of the elect and through the assholes the
assholes go down the guys who caused Israel the heartache however they had
to have a place for God's love towards his his elect and they found that in
this beautiful story I think and you're gonna go into detail about it so yeah
back to that question explain the audience what what pushed you over the
edge to IO and I'm hearing you man I like this so you know it really all
started for me when I realized the exclusivity of Israel's law okay that
was kind of like the whoa like mind-blow moment for me you know you have all
these fundamental Christian wackadoodles out here claiming that people are all
in violation of God's law on the hearts right yet nobody can explain what the
hell that law is right it is it the nine commandments because of course we
don't observe the Sabbath right is it the 613 laws of Torah now that would be
far too blind right so what the hell is the law of God that all these people are
in violation of breaking so much that's the question that I really wanted to set
out to find because you know I'm looking at this from my own perspective and I'm
saying okay here we are in America right land of the free the home of the
brave and we have these different ideals and principles and viewpoints on
what's right and what's wrong right for instance I'll give you an example I was
doing a trek through the Himalayan Mountains two or three years ago in
Nepal very you very cool experience man I I conned my fiance while she was then
my girlfriend but I conned her into thinking that we were going on a
luxurious and all vacation and when we got there I was like surprised we're
trekking through the mountains for the next six days and we're going to be
sleeping with spiders the size of tangerines oh so yeah it was it was not
I didn't really do for it she had somewhat of an idea but I think when we
got there and she realized just how brutal it was going to be and how we
were going to be roughing it she kind of had a little bit of a nervous breakdown
but lover to death she made it through and it was kind of like one of those
experiences that like it show that you can accomplish things and conquer fears
and I would recommend it to anyone super cheap to do too so but anyways while I
was there we were walking with our Sherpa who is you know the guy who takes
you through the mountains and he would carry our bags I mean these guys are
absolute animals for all they throw like hundred-pound packs on their bags and
they're just walking straight up steep mountains while we're in the back with
little water bottles like and these guys are just laughing their asses off
walking up the hills so but we stop at the end of each night and we kind of
gather around a little fire and these little huts and we eat the worst food
you could imagine and and so we're talking and this this one guy his name
was Krishna it was named after the God right wow
Krishna was telling us about how in Nepalese culture in the remote parts I
should say like the people who still live in these villages if you were to
commit adultery and cheat on your wife murder is almost well it is considered
an acceptable reaction to that and and he actually had some friends who were
serving sentences in jail short ones he said like five years they really don't
they don't in other words if you commit adultery you kind of have something
coming to you and and if it's death it's just kind of like almost culturally
culturally acceptable you know the way that he was he was explaining it to me
is that you know marriage is extremely sacred and should never be broken and so
the point that I'm getting at here is that to these Nepalese villagers out in
these these mountains to them there's really no condemnation in the inner man
or in the heart about killing an unfaithful spouse you know and and and I
think there's a lot of that stuff going on in the world where we're just kind of
isolated to the states and I've done a fair bit of international travel so I
see different things in different cultures and you know it's clear that one
size doesn't fit all okay you know if God was giving a moral heart law where
everybody had the exact same rules and everybody had the exact same guilt and
what's going on why are people eating other people in certain places both of
this day so you know that that was one of the things but anyways you know I
I would I would think that it would be wise that the God of the Bible would
declare his laws to all people so that they could know and understand them right
and actually abide by them yet all I could ever see were these weak arguments
for these ten commandments minus the Sabbath one of course but even then even
if you just took the nine or ten commandment thing and said okay that's
what we're under today there are still so many vile acts that are outside of
those ten commandments so now what are those permitted by God you know so
there's a lot of gray areas there but needless to say this was on my brain a
lot as I searched the scriptures to find proof that all humanity was under some
law what I found rather is the exact opposite I found overwhelming proof that
God declared his laws to nobody other than Israel bro the passages are
legitimately everywhere especially in the Old Testament but they're also in the
new such as the psalmist saying that he declares his laws to Jacob his statutes
and judgments to Israel he has not done this with any nation right and as for
their judgments they have not known them I mean what do you do with a passage
like that you have the psalmist clearly declaring that God didn't give his laws
to anyone other than Israel and then on the flip side you have these wackadoodles
today saying everybody's under God's law so what's the truth right am I to
believe what the Bible says about God's law or am I to believe what Pastor Joe
says about the law right so obviously I was starting to see things such as when
Moses looked at the people of Israel back in the Deuteronomy and asked them
quote what great nation is there that has the laws and commandments that our
Lord has set before us this day and what great nation is there that has their
Lord their God so close to them as the Lord our God is to us or perhaps Moses
instructing the people to take the law seriously because it was to do everything
to them they were to write it everywhere on doorposts on their foreheads they were
to speak of it when they woke up or when they walk by the way or even when they
lie down they were to write it on the frontlets between their eyes I mean
that's what the law being written on the heart is in the story man it's the
importance of the covenant people taking this shit serious right and and you know
even even Paul in Romans chapter 9 stating clear as day that the law
belonged to Israel in the flesh which of course is a covenant return term
referring to the circumcised weiner more so than it is a blood and flesh and
blood term when you when you became circumcised in the weiner you literally
became Israel we'll get into that a little bit later anyways what I found
is that there is legitimately nothing in the Bible says anyone had God's law
besides Israel the covenant people and I think one of the soul passages where
people pull this false idea from is Romans chapter 2 where Paul says the
following he says for when Gentiles who do not have the law by nature do the
things in the law these although not having the law are a law to themselves
who show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also
bearing witness and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else
excusing them in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus
according to my gospel so the first question I would need to ask is why
would a pagan by nature as Paul says it do the things in the law of Moses right
because that's Paul's entire argument here he's saying these particular heathens
these ones living out in the nations these prodigal sons are sometimes doing
some of the things by nature right naturally by sheer tradition by sheer
habit they're doing some shit that the law of Moses requires right right why
would they be doing things in the law if they lived on the other side of the
globe all right it just doesn't make any sense unless these are Israelites who
had been dispersed and been paganized but still sometimes by sheer tradition or
habit they held on to some of the traditions held within the law of Moses
the other thing to consider is if this passage was applicable today then what
Gentiles are sometimes doing things that are in the law of Moses right you see
the issue there I mean are you slaughtering a goat every once in a
while there no absolutely not yeah that was actually when I was watching your
your last episode I saw how you explain that part because there are differing
positions in IO and I even told this to a couple of my friends Ryan Provost I
told this to I may have mentioned this to David King I'm not sure they differ
they differ than your position and I actually agree with your position about
strangers yes foreigners okay that there were people but this is the thing I
like how you say this about the law you got to start with precepts before you
get into conclusions because it wasn't that hey we want we want to give this
law to every nation or another nation it was Israel however you could come in
foreigners could come in and we'll get into we'll get into the new covenant how
you guys you know how you your position answers that but they say hey no these
are literally you had to be like from and I say it again the nutsack of Abraham
and so I tend to think covenantly rather than biologically and don't get me
wrong it's just like we know the the the centric is biological okay we know that
it is that's like the main thing and that's part of it that's part of it for
sure right right and it definitely is you can't escape that because that's a big
push in this and I think that's actually arguments that take place in some
spots but please please keep going I just I like how you answer why who these
Gentiles were it's a good offer up and it's not just like a crappy explanation
right one person could say hey these Gentiles are authentic non-Israelites
this is why they look pagan this is why they're going toward people who are
never even a part of the old covenant in any way shape or form and so you
explain that in your last video and I'm still open to possible other
explanations don't get me wrong but I want to hear your position through and
everybody in the audience please check it out leave comments go to his videos
ask questions do Jason's on their active so he's willing to show you
scriptures that he believes you know he's willing to go wherever the truth
goes if you find a better explanation I know he's there however you've been
wrestling with this for a while and I have not so I'm gonna let the master of
this view keep going yeah man and so the one thing I will say about this whole
paganized Israelite idea well two things actually the first is that if you
familiar with what Moses laid out in the beginning in Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse
27 and forward he actually when he's when he's speaking to the children of
Israel he's telling them that hey listen in the latter days right you're going to
be paganized he literally tells them this he says you're gonna be paganized
you're gonna be scattered throughout the nations you're gonna be worshiping the
work of men's hands wood and stone right you're gonna be out there just doing
things you shouldn't do in other words not abiding by the laws right that's the
whole point and so you're gonna be you're gonna be out there doing these
things but right but this is what he says he says he says but the Lord your
God will turn and he will have mercy upon you and remember the covenant that
he made with your father's right now I'm gonna come to this again because this is
crucial but I'm just gonna call your attention to Galatians chapter 3 for a
moment where Paul is writing to both Jew and Gentile but obviously not outside of
the confines of the elect and he's telling these Jews and Gentiles
Israelites that if they are Christ it doesn't matter if they're Jew it doesn't
matter if they've become Greek it doesn't matter wherever they've gone if they are
Christ it is because they are Abraham's seed and what heirs according to promise
so Moses in the beginning says hey you're in the end you're gonna be out in the
nations but God's gonna turn and have mercy and remember the promise and here
he is in Galatians Paul is telling these elect ones these chosen ones that
doesn't matter where life has taken them if they're Christ it's because they're
Abraham's seed and they're receiving the benefit of that covenant promise that
was made at the start so not to get too much into that I have more on that later
but back to this law okay the second question that one would need to ask is
who had the law written on the heart in this story was it anyone other than
Israel well the answer is no take Isaiah 51 7 for example where the prophet
says to the people of Israel he says you people in whose hearts is my law or
Deuteronomy chapter 6 when Moses says specifically and exclusively to the
Israelites and these words which I command you today shall be in your heart
you shall teach them diligently to your children and talk of them when you sit
in your house when you walk by the way when you lie down and when you rise up
or even in Jeremiah 31 31 where the prophet is speaking of the new covenant
God would make with the two houses of Israel when he brought them back to
Jerusalem from all the places where they were scattered in the second temple
returned to Zion period and the prophet says flat out that God would write his
laws in the hearts of the house of Judah and the house of Israel there is
nobody else in that statement who's receiving the laws written on the hearts
other than Israel so we can see from those three passages along with tons of
others that I won't mention that the only people who ever had the law in the
hearts is Israel okay the law in the heart doesn't mean that God actually took
a sharpie and wrote it on a heart okay the law in the heart simply
represents the giving of the law and the importance of the law or in other words
it was how the people of Israel should have handled this law it should have
been everything to them it should have been when you put something in your
heart when you if you care about your loved one that that person is in your
heart right that person is of utmost importance to you right it's everything
to you same thing with the law the law was to be in their hearts they were to
observe it with utmost sincerity and effort and obviously they fail big time
the question on that if you don't want to ask you the writing Jeremiah 31 the
writing on the hearts the new covenant okay um let's let's let's touch on that
for one second and then I want to mention that that that key element that you
talked about when we were talking about Midrash and what was the name of the
other thing Remus Remus it seems to me correct me if I'm wrong that's what's
going on here as well it was almost as if there was a fulfillment of this
already in the Old Testament with Israel coming back northern kingdoms and yet
the New Testament whoever these authors were Saul Israel scattered in the Roman
Empire messing around with all these idols messing around with all these
different things and Paul seems to talk about these idols a lot too and here he
goes reapplying this principle Jeremiah 31 so keep that in mind audience keep that
in mind you're absolutely right and it's I think what is it Hebrews 8 or 9 where
where the author of Hebrews called a plot he calls attention to Jeremiah 31
and the people today Christianity in general says look that's our covenant
today but no that's not what that's not what the author of Hebrews is doing at
all actually if you look at what the author of Hebrews does there he refers
back to the time where God had you know called the people of Israel back to the
land and established a new covenant with them and what he says is he says you
know God I should have pulled it up but he basically says you know had the first
one not been flawless there would have been no need for a second one kind of
thing in other words the first one was coming out of Egypt the second one was
coming back to the land when in the return to Zion and you know and if you
just look at what he's doing there he's basically just calling remembrance back
to the fact he's using midrash basically and he's calling remembrance back to the
fact of when the Israelites came back to the land and I find that kind of
ironic because in the Old Testament you have the all these Old Testament
prophetic texts and predictions or maybe they were written after who knows
right of these of the Israelites coming back to Jerusalem right coming back to
the land the new heaven the new heaven new earth of Isaiah 65 and 66 my friend
that is not 8070 that is return to Zion second temple period right and if you
look at the contextual details there there is no denying that so you have the
coming back to the physical promised land Jerusalem for the people of Israel
then in the New Testament you have this sort of spiritual idea of the Israelites
coming back from all places where they were so there's a lot of comparisons
between the natural and the spiritual that I see there too but I mean doesn't
Jesus say that to the Samaritan woman you you you know you worship from this
mountain we worship it won't matter where you worship anymore don't worry
about that you're gonna come to the Lord but you're not gonna have to go to a
place anymore it's gonna be a new covenant however it's in his blood and
so this is a totally different they're using Old Testament concepts but they're
reapplying a totally unique continuation of the ideas with it seems to be the 12
so right and you see in the Old Testament they're coming back to Jerusalem
right where the prophet Isaiah says they'll be singing in the streets children
will play tambourines the old men and the young men will rejoice they'll be you
know sinners will die a curse there they'll be fruit and vineyards and
planting and it'll be joy in Jerusalem and my people of joy and this is all
about the coming back and and I always say that you know this this could have
been just predictions and hopeful expectations of the prophets it doesn't
necessarily have to be spot-on accurate like history says all this took place
right it could just be the prophet speaking like this is what he hoped
would take place when the people come back you know but but then when you get
to the when you get to the New Testament now you have this new Jerusalem not made
with hands in the heavens right so same kind of thing but but to me it's still
only the Israelites there but we'll go on with the law so as to not get caught
up there too much so the third and final question besides that the heart
question is that needs to be asked is about the law and the hearts for all
humanity is how right how could it be that this is the case when the Bible in
many different places goes above and beyond to actually declare the opposite
you know God is actually saying he didn't give his laws to anybody but
Israel so wouldn't this be a direct contradiction if indeed all humanity had
God's laws I mean God declares this fact repeatedly that nobody but Israel had
the laws and then everybody says despite that nope everyone without
exception is under God's laws do you see the problem which one is it would the
Bible be contradicting itself the truth is that I don't think it does we just
haven't been very good at understanding who these pagans were in the nations
alright Paul explained to them who they were in Galatians 3 when he said if
they were Christ and they received that Holy Spirit promise then that meant they
were Abraham's seed and heirs of course we know Abraham's seed is only ever used
for Israel in this story so we know that Paul is telling them that if they are
Christ it's because they're Israel and heirs according to the promise made to
their father Abraham but the bottom line is that God said he didn't give his laws
to anyone that for me that settles the issue the ones with the laws on the
hearts were nothing more than Israel afar off that Peter referred to in Acts
chapter 2 when looking at the Israelites Peter said to them the promise is to you
Israel to your children still Israel and to all who are afar off as many as
our Lord will call that's Israel near and Israel afar off people read that and
they change the context they say oh yeah he's talking to Israel he says the
promises for them and their children but then he says the promise is also for
those who are afar off that's other people no Peter's saying that the
promise is for Israel near and Israel afar off just like Jesus said I have
sheep they're Gentile that's right right okay got you and I and Jesus looked at
the Jews and said I have sheep not of this fold in other words I have I have
Israelites who are not of the Jewish fold who are not under the law who are not
observing who are so freakin dead in trespasses and sins that they don't know
which way is up technically no matter what the sheep is Israel so only sheeps
or you have sheeps either way you have technically using Old Testament idea
those who who wandered from Judah that were kind of blended they had other
gods they had and then you never got there however they got there that that's
what I meant earlier when I said you don't have a lot of details right I
mean we have the book of the Maccabees which obviously says that just a couple
hundred years before Christ Israelites were actually leaving the law and
joining in with the pagans right they were leaving the law they were
uncircumcising they weren't circumcising their children the book says it Maccabees
also reports that they were neglecting the Sabbath they weren't abiding by the
covenant I mean this sets us up perfectly for the time of Christ where you
have this mission going out to the nations doesn't it to collect in lost
sheep I mean come on right I mean but but the point that I'm trying to make
here is that you don't have everything just held out in black and white
sometimes you have to do a little deduction and kind of draw these
concepts out now of course there's many passages which you'll see shortly that
do specifically and explicitly state these things but for the most part I
think people kind of read over them which is why you have to be careful but
again the bottom line is that the Israel near and Israel afar off aka the law
observant Israel aka who was a Jew and the non law observant Israel like aka
the Gentile when the fullness of those Gentiles came in the result of that
would be all Israel saved all right that's the meat and potatoes that's the
sum of all the parts Paul looked ahead and said when the fullness of the
nations comes in all Israel will be saved he didn't say when the fullness of
the nations come in all Gentiles will be saved or all the nations go the fullness
of the nations coming in resulted in all Israel being saved and that was the goal
and the sum of all the parts and don't mind me stopping right there because
that's so important what you just said I have heard IO I've heard you I've heard
guys talk about IO and I never really understood what you guys meant by the
fullness of the Gentiles coming in yes now I do and I only say that because if
you're like me and I'm sure a lot of people out there like me you got to
repeat yourself and and and I listen and I listen and then it makes sense oh
okay yeah I always thought Gentiles meant actual non-Israelite total pagan
absolutely foreign to anything of Israel's precepts laws anything right
total non-Israelites all together however now I get what you guys are trying
to say so when we see references of Gentiles practically I'll say most
references I don't know if all of them because I haven't done research myself
to consider all of them definitely not all okay I see what they're thinking
yes okay because salvation is for the lost sheep or for Israel for his sheep I
came to save my people or he shall save his people from their sins Matthew 121
now when we see that that you're saying the mission all the way through Gentiles
are Israel therefore when you have Jew and Gentile and the fullness of these
Gentiles which is the fullness of Israel really the lost ones coming in you
have all of Israel now so now all Israel shall be saved it's the idea that the
remnant the elect that the the one-tenth that percentage idea from the Old
Testament where even then there was a remnant and so I get where you're going
with this yeah so like you know people people I see often conflate the term
Jew and Israel and that's an error right I mean because all Jews weren't true
Israel right I mean yeah you know in the cultural times time times of those days
if you referred to if you were saying Israel you were lightly referring to
the Jews right but but there were Israelites that were not you they were
not Jewish right they were out in the nations right and Paul goes into this
in Romans 9 very clearly which I'll mention here soon but Samaritans yeah
Israelites they were not Jews bold and blunt right there I got you so yeah
so cool man so anyways you know just to kind of wrap up the whole law thing it
really was the law and its exclusivity that pushed me towards Israel only the
law was the curse Paul said that flat out and Galatians chapter 3 he also said
that as many as were under the law were under the curse which again shows the
exclusivity of the curse you weren't cursed unless you were under the law and
if only had the law if only Israel had the law right and wouldn't you know it
the book of Revelation describes the curse as being no more when the mother
of all harlots was destroyed that being Jerusalem right there will be no more
curse okay and Jesus said every jot and tittle of the law would pass away when
heaven and earth passed away and when the temple fell so it makes sense because
you you can't have the law without a temple which was the epicenter of the
whole system and that's why they not us were in the last days and that's why I
believe it all was it was tied to the law and I'm gonna get into Adam a little
later on too which will sort of tie in some of that law curse motif back in the
garden but for now I'll leave it at that that's probably that the main reason
that kind of pushed me into IO was understanding the exclusivity of Israel's
law because if you're not if you don't have God's law then how are you
standing before a judge right how are you how are you coming under the
judgment standing before the judge how are the books being opened what books
were those well that's the works of the law the book of the law right in in
Colossians I think Paul tells them he says you know he has fulfilled the
handwriting requirements that was against us right handwritten requirements
so again how am I going to stand before a judge a judge in the spiritual
realm when I die if I never even so much as had any sort of handwritten
requirement by God right because I didn't you know unless you're gonna say
that the 613 laws are finding against me I mean that's stupid but yeah man
that's basically the singular fact that I think really did it and then there's
obviously an ever-sized mountain of scriptural evidence that I would say
as well well we've touched on some of the salvific New Testament text already
and so I want to delve into that question with you because I think it's
important you know go through a rundown of some scriptural reasons why you
believe the New Testament is about or only about the salvation of Israel not
about the salvation of all humanity like nearly all Christians believe you know
what I mean I mean they're always applying it to them don't get me wrong I
can reference right back to your personal experience I can write reference
right back to mine you don't need this book and say my personal experience now
needs to be inserted in the context of this New Testament or Old Testament or
any of this book in order for it to be true and I've told this to a Christian
in the Facebook group I said I don't need these 66 books right to know
something's up okay for me yeah and I said if the book was eliminated from this
earth because they're firm believers yeah would you still believe and you know
it's almost like they believe the book of God it's like you know so talk to us
about some of the New Testament references that really kind of say guys
if you thought it was universal okay think again because here is the
exclusivity the mission here it is Jason the constant yeah dude so some of the
main reasons that I hold to Israel only are obviously I've already kind of went
over but I'm gonna give you kind of just a basic rundown I don't know 15 20
minutes maybe more who knows there certain New Testament texts as well as
Old Testament texts that kind of just tie it all together for me the obvious
reason is because it's literally everywhere in the Bible I mean you had
said it before like how do you go through the Old Testament seeing the
exclusivity of Israel and God's care and love for them and then somehow you come
to the last days of Israel in the New Testament and that suddenly changes
right and now God's love is it or I should say Yahweh's love is upon
everybody right but all throughout the Old Testament everybody kind of got the
shit end of the stick unless you joined yourself to Israel right so that that
whole part of it didn't really make sense to me but you know some places in
the Bible it's explicitly stated such as Matthew 15 24 where Jesus says I come
only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel I mean dude as a parent would
you ever say that you only love your first son and you don't love your second
son or that you only came for your first son and didn't come for your second I
mean it just seems asinine to suggest that this savior of so-called all
humanity would make such a bold statement saying that he only came for
Israel if in fact he didn't only come for Israel right it just doesn't make
sense but then there's other places where it's stated in roundabout ways such
escalations for verses four to five which say he was born into the law to
redeem those under the law I mean that's clear as day we know it only Israel
had the law and it's Paul says Christ was born into that law to redeem those
specifically under that law Hebrews 915 also says he was his blood was for
sins committed under the first covenant so you know in other places you have to
do a little work though you have to kind of deduct the meeting and pull the
meaning out from the text such as what I mentioned recently in Galatians 3 verse
23 and forward which I'll read here this is so important this is the first point
it's Abraham's seed in that term and what it means Paul in the Galatians 3 verse
26 says this he says for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ for as
many of you were as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither
June or Greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female
for you are all one in Christ here it is and if you are Christ's then you are
Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise now when people read that they
automatically think look when I have faith in Christ it makes me Abraham's
seed right but no that's not what it says at all the text is actually saying
that in order to be Christ you must be Abraham's seed right that that's the
prerequisite for being Christ is that you're an heir according to the promise
right you don't just become an heir you you are Abraham's seed which was
another term for Israel which I'm about to go into but and that's the reason why
you are Christ because you're an heir according to the promise so in Galatians
323 and forward what I just read we see Paul tell this mixed bag of saints that
it didn't matter if they were Jew or Gentile if they were Christ it was
because they were heirs and Abraham's seed the mistake that all Christians make
well most of them anyway among bill among millions of theological errors is
that they redefine this term Abraham's seed to mean something that it never
meant okay if we allow the scriptures to interpret this phrase we would see
that it always without reservation refers to old covenant Israel that's who
Abraham's seed is in this story okay so what you can't do is you can't see that
Abraham's seed is referred to for Israel all throughout the Old Testament and
then suddenly come to the New Testament last days of Israel where Jesus comes to
his own and says he only came for his own and suddenly you take that term Abraham
seed and you say hey you know what I'm gonna change that now it's gonna mean
everybody everywhere all right you can't do that okay you know if we have to
allow the scripture to interpret the scripture all right for instance take
Isaiah chapter 41 I'm gonna give you one example here and honestly bro there
are hundreds I know I know I've heard you I'm like I'm not even gonna
reference these guys get your Bibles out and just go with him yeah man so and
I'm not gonna get into every single passage that uses the term Abraham seed
but I'm gonna give you one wham bam thank you man passage that's really gonna
say it all okay and then and obviously anybody who's read the Bible and knows
how many times this term is used in the Old Testament knows that it's it's
always Israel right it's Abraham seed is Israel okay so here in Isaiah chapter
41 verse 8 the prophet says this he says what you Israel are my servant Jacob
whom I have chosen the seed of Abraham my friend okay so I mean it doesn't get
any clearer than that does it no Abraham seed is Israel plain as day all right so
when we look at that example as it's just one of hundreds and we compare that
to Galatians chapter 3 where Paul says to these mixed bagged saints he says for
you are all one in Christ and if you are Christ then you are Abraham seed and
heirs according to the promise well Abraham seed is Israel so essentially
what Paul is saying there to this mixed bag of individuals is these elect ones
saying if you are Christ then you are Israel and in air according to promise
okay let me ask you something on that if you don't mind because I know there's a
few and I don't want to stop because I know you got a lot to go through here
it's important we talk about this difference between you and the other
IO or guys that I've noticed and correct me if I'm wrong because you guys are
usually like 99% similar in the way you look at this your willingness
consider that strangers foreigners could become absolutely they're not and
they're like hey no no no see right here Jason you're inconsistent they'll try
to throw that at you and go Jason you're inconsistent because right there's
Abraham seed that's talking about the nut sack okay that's talking about the
weiner okay that's no pun intended on can I cut you off
yeah let me circumcise your force here here brother all right so here's the
deal all right in the Old Testament in Genesis 15 to 17 we see God make the
promise to Abraham right and what does he say to Abraham he says that your
descendants will become as the stars of heaven in number they'll become so you
know numerous right multitude great multitude and in chapter 17 we see him
make the covenant promise right and what does he say to Abraham he says he
commands them to be circumcised into circumcised on the eighth day and
everything but notice where the covenant promise is in Genesis 17 it's in the
flesh all right and the whole point of Genesis 17 covenant promise is the
weiner schnitzel all right it's all it's all about circumcision brother so when
a foreigner circumcised the old Don Johnson in my opinion they became as
native born just like Ezekiel the prophet says right and so you have Israel as
more of a covenant term which represented those who had the old weiner schnitzel
snipped and that's where the promise was and Paul reiterates this in Romans 9
where he says that the promise the adoption the glory the covenants the
giving of the law all belong to who Israel in the flesh got it now now
that's not Israel in the blood and veins that's Israel in the penile all
right that's Israel by way of circumcision so to in my opinion when a
foreigner became Israel when they when they joined the covenant they were
circumcised and they became Israel and they became as native born and they
would have easily hands down refer to Abraham as their father I mean Jews
still do today right so so you have Abraham seed as being applicable to
those who became Israel by way of circumcision because again that is where
the promise was got it so when they say to me oh it's gotta be as you say by the
nutsack I say no it's it's actually not by the nutsack it's it's by the
snipping right so anybody could come into Israel and become Israel by way of the
snippety I'm digging it and I'm following you I'm tracking and then just
to tie on that the Gentiles that were not snippety snipped way that this is an
interesting thing yeah how it became an issue obviously for Paul you could tell
he was dealing with some some knuckleheads yeah and rightfully so this
is why we're trying to explain why are they removing the requirement right
they're becoming a spiritual circumcision of art rather than of the
schnitzel okay that is why Roman Providence is trying to go okay and a
lot of scholars are going this is a Hellenized message because you wouldn't
you wouldn't remove something like that unless you were trying to somehow
cooperate better with others okay this or okay here's another option if indeed
this is a let's just let's just call it a well I guess either way whether it's
fiction or nonfiction right if my theory is correct that there was a rapture
where the saints were literally caught up into the clouds ascended into the
clouds just like the first born of the brethren right if that is what this
story is saying whether it's true or false if that's what the story is saying
then indeed the law and every aspect of it including circumcision was about to
abruptly come to a screeching end okay and so if you have Paul in the in the
nations working with these Israelites who are not circumcised right who are
dead in the trespass of being uncircumcised in the flesh now remember
Paul says that why on earth would a pagan be guilty of being uncircumcised in
the flesh he never had the commandment right but Paul tells these ones in
Colossae that they were dead in the trespass in other words in the violation
of not being circumcised so the point is is that Paul's working hard like you
said becoming all things to all people because he realizes that there's an end
looming okay and the way I look at it is these are the accounts of the mission
being carried out and it would have made no sense for for Paul to say hey
everything's gonna end in 10 15 years anyway why don't you go get your wiener
snipped right it just to me it just doesn't make sense if the entire story
was coming to an end the way that it actually says it was and the end of all
things is at hand then then it makes sense to me that Paul wouldn't be trying
to get these these ones to come back in in fact I think it's in Romans or maybe
Corinthians where he literally says this in the letter he says stay in the
condition that you were called right does if you were called a Jew and
circumcised stay that way he says if you were called a Gentile and uncircumcised
there's no need to be circumcised right condition you were called stay that way
right and in other words what he's saying is the end of all things is at
hand here so just stay that way right so I get what you're what you're saying
about Roman propaganda and all that but to me if we're gonna accept the story
for what it says and that also that obviously includes the rapture of the
saints at the end right which of course makes this really probable to be myth
because dude people floating up into space I mean come on right although we
all believed it when we came into Christianity didn't we so and that's
because we took a plain reading of the text and we didn't think too hard on it
and that's what we saw but if we're gonna take that position and we're gonna
allow it to say what it says in my opinion and maybe if I have time I'll
get into the rapture thing a little later then we need to be consistent with it
and realize that it does kind of make sense if you if you understand that the
the law was becoming obsolete right the covenant the old covenant the age the
temple the sacrifices all that shit was passing away you know in some just to
throw out my my personal where I'm coming because I get it okay I'm just
just my idea yeah here's my idea about this myth and yes I say myth because I
really do think today I think that if there's any practical like in the real
world sense in which this this message is presented if there is any real
practical application of this text to Israelites that were in the first
century maybe even into the early second century is that and I only say this
because I'm looking at a historical angle of what was going on between Rome
and Israel is that they're trying to say the law is getting in the way okay it's
creating a division that is causing you guys issues with these other nations and
so it's exclusively for Israel to stop being such knuckleheads and start
spiritualizing principles that were fleshly that were causing issues with
the world at hand so the only thing I'm thinking of and I'm thinking how can
circumcision cause issues how could eating of non-clean foods help Israel
yeah it would in it would allow them to get along better with the world around
them because they were haters of humanity per Su Tonius and Tacitus and
and these Roman historians were like they were haters of humanity because
they were so exclusive that would be the only practical sense in which I could
see this message being good for Israel to the nations that are non-Israelite
however I like what you're saying because in the story at hand without going
beyond and looking at what's really culturally going on and historically
going on in the first century could they both be true somehow maybe I'm just
wondering and and what's interesting too is I think it's an axe and I'm just
going totally off the cuff on this but I read it recently in the in a study
where you know Paul goes to the Jews the Jews tell them like you know what is it
that you're telling these people that they shouldn't be circumcised whatever
and then he tells them something and then they come back and they come to an
agreement they say okay well let's just let's just make sure that they refrain
from idols and don't eat blood or whatever it was right right again
here's the here's the thing that must make somebody think it's like if these
aren't Israelites that are out in the nations if these aren't children of
Israel who should be abiding by the law then what the hell are the Jews telling
Paul make sure they at least do this you know I it just there's something there
that I think we need to dig in deeper on because if these were just pagans right
then why is why are there some law mandates that are being passed to them
by the Jews right to me it's because they were you know they were they were
obviously Israelites but and I know the other side says for them to even become
they would need something to show that they're following what we're doing but
I'm this is an I.O. show so this is going to be important and showing why your
position is way it is I'm just thinking out loud so please I didn't mean to
interrupt you this is good yeah so back to the whole Abraham's seed deal which
is extremely important to understand you know Christians today they really
think that they're Abraham's seed and in some spiritual sense like a spiritual
Israelite of sorts but the Bible never so much as even hints at this idea it's
just not there you know one common thing you'll hear Christians say is quote
God promised to multiply Abraham's seed like the stars of heaven and number that
promise is fulfilled in Christians today just look at us we're all over the
world there's millions of us in every country that is surely the fulfillment
of God's promise to multiply Abraham's seed but again this is nothing more end
quote I'm sorry this is nothing more than a clear display of the sheer
ignorance of Christians when it comes to actually knowing their Bibles if they
knew their Bibles better they surely would not be claiming this and the
reason they wouldn't be claiming this is because they would be aware of the fact
that this promise to multiply Abraham's seed like the stars of heaven in number
was actually fulfilled centuries before Christ supposedly walked the earth
check out Deuteronomy chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 for just one example and again
I'm just giving you the tip I like to just give you the tip as a teaser but I
don't put the whole thing in what she said that's right so I'll give you the
tip here in Deuteronomy chapter 1 verse 9 look what Moses says to the people of
Israel as they come there they're out of Egypt and they're headed their way and
he says and I spoke to you at that time saying I alone am not able to bear you
Israelites here it is the Lord your God has multiplied you and here you are
today as the stars of heaven in number all right so so so let me ask you a
question that that phrase that I just quoted from every blackadoodle Christian
on planet earth who thinks there's some spiritual Israelite or Abraham seed
spiritually because they've multiplied multiplied and there's 17 billion
Christians on earth whatever it is does that really make sense if this was
already fulfilled in old covenant Israel centuries before Jesus even came to be
it doesn't make sense right so yeah so Abraham seed is Israel in this story
that is exactly who that promise was for that is exactly who became like the
stars of heaven in number that is exactly who was multiplied like the sand on the
seashore all of these things were fulfilled in old covenant Israel all
right and and old covenant Israel blossomed and had grown into this
multitude that was so numerous right I mean just look at the book of numbers
man the book of numbers is all about Israel's numbers yeah this honestly had
nothing to do with anyone today nor did it have to do with anyone beyond Israel
back then then further on if we if we look in Romans chapter 4 here in
regards to the seed we see what Paul says in Romans 4 13 he says this for the
promise that he would be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed
through the law but through the righteousness of faith now I know when
people read that they they don't because of the way that it's worded they kind of
lose focus of what Paul is actually saying there but let me read it again
and I'm going to insert something in there just stays in context okay it says
this for the promise that he would be heir of the world was not to Abraham or
to his seed through the law but it was to his seed through the righteousness of
faith okay so do you see how just adding to his seed to the second part of that
kind of keeps it all in check because what it's saying basically is the promise
wasn't to Abraham and or Israel through the law it was to Israel through faith
so the promise doesn't extend beyond Israel as a whole there's just a remnant
of faithful ones within the totality of Israel all right and so we see that it
never extends and it and there was a remnant within and elsewhere in Romans
and for instance in chapter 9 we have more proof of this this is like like
drop the mic type stuff here Paul in Romans 9 verse 22 asked this question he
says what if God wanting to show his wrath and make known his power endured
with much long suffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction and that
he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he
had prepared beforehand for glory even us whom he called not of the Jews only but
also of the Gentiles so he asked this sort of rhetorical question like the
mercies even coming to the Gentiles right or to the nations and then look what
he does in verse 25 he quotes three old text portions and again we're talking
about Midrash here bro right but what is Midrash and Remes used for it's used so
that the recipients of the letter would call to remember in certain things in
the Old Testament that took place and would understand the direction that Paul
is going here all right so what he says is is God also having mercy on the
nations and then he goes as he says also in Hosea I will call them my people who
are not my people and her beloved who is not my beloved and it shall come to pass
in the place where it was said to them you are not my people there they shall be
called sons of the living God well if you go back to Hosea I Hosea II this exact
portion is there and it's only about dispersed Israelites out in the nations
the 10 tribes exactly here in as he proceeds here Paul and the next verse
look what he look what he lobs up here right so so remember he just asked he
said is God also merciful of the Gentiles right and if we just skip over
the Hosea passage look what he says in verse 27 he throws this up like a soft
ball pitch he says Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel all right right see
what he did so he's as Gentiles and Jews are Israel right here exactly and what
he says there he says though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand
of the sea the remnant will be saved okay they'll make a short work upon the
earth so dude I mean he just literally handed that one to you on a silver
platter and said hey the people that I just asked about those Gentiles Isaiah
also cries out concerning Israel though their number be as the sand of the sea
the remnant will be saved right is it fair to say if you don't mind me saying
this for my audience here is it fair to say that let's suppose just to just to
save because remember I told everybody here this was an intellectual
position this is not just somebody who could just easily grasp this is a
complex building up of Old Testament New Testament Midrash continuity mission
let's take a let's take a satellite real quick and snap down let's play a game
and say Gentiles are pagans no matter what what you're saying either way even
though you're trying to make sense of this thing either way you got a dead
stop situation that happens here right in front of us someone hits a brick wall
around 70 AD so what makes more sense the dead stop so that you can universalize
this message and have it in or and I can easily see even in these passages where
non-Israelites could take this and apply it I see how it can happen I could see
how Rome would do this easily misconstru these things I can see where
there's elements of even possible tainting of the text my opinion where
they may have played with things but my point is you're you're showing a mission
here yes is the mission to save the entire Roman Empire I think not because
I do think there were scattered all over the Empire and I think there is some
elements that is involved I think there is some elements that there is things
that still can fit this whole IO thing and still allow a Roman friendship so to
speak from Israel hey we're good with you guys don't you know we're the
remnant we're the elect okay we're cool with you these assholes over here
causing us problems you know they sick sick of you know Jesus sins the Romans
to kick their ass so it's like you know yeah no I hear you and obviously you
know my thoughts on the creating price because I've produced like five hours
worth of shit on it but but the main the main thing for me that that well
besides what the text states you know I would look at the fact of this is not a
new religion right I mean I think what where people go wrong in the New
Testament is they look at it and they say oh look you know whatever it is
whether it's truth or whether it's propaganda whatever it is it was designed
for all time to be a religion to unify people to whatever the case may be but
when you understand it in terms of its eschatological end of the age ending
right you can see that this was actually just the mission that's all it is it's
not a religion it's a mission to go out like Jesus said to seek the elect from
the four winds of the earth to gather them in before his coming for them and
then the end would come and and throughout the entirety of the New
Testament we have finality statements and conclusion statements that show that
nobody else could be Christ after Christ came for them right that was the end
that was when all those who were Christ were raised at the last day when all the
elect were given to God when the kingdom was delivered to God that's the end
right so if this is a religion that was intended to go beyond that then what in
the flying hell are we doing what what kind of who wrote this thing right hey
let's write it let's create a some sort of a mythological tale or story that
we're gonna unify Jews and Gentiles for all time but let's cap it at AD 70 and
say all those who belong to Christ basically Christians are completely
saved and and they're all delivered to God at the end it just to me those two
extremes just make it really hard man and I and I know you know we're not gonna
go into the whole creating Christ thing here but we can come on and maybe do
like a back and forth on that dude I I know you're you're very friendly too
and I know that that you obviously know James is and just have a dialogue but I
want to say something that's important on
preterism in this respect yeah this is why I think the New Testament is a
Hellenized Jewish movement okay and the reason why not only are they
removing certain prerequisites that may even fit into the eschatological which
it does fit into the eschatological endgame
yeah Dead Sea Scrolls that we discovered in the kumran
sect had and I was looking at this and I've been researching this lately it's
amazing yeah they had an endgame too but get this their endgame was
Rome is going down they were still holding on to
the uncircumcised Philistines okay they had this idea
that Rome was the enemy of God they were the sons of darkness and that Israel
their their group of Israel they even they said the the Roman sympathizer
Jews the Roman sympathizer Israelites screw those guys
they're going down too they had an endgame that was supposed to happen
during that time period as well of course it never happened
right because Rome ended up on top I think the New Testament
is the Jewish Hellenized Israelite and and I think that what you're saying is
very intelligent I'm telling you because I've been listening to a lot of stuff
and I love what you're saying Jason I think we can
elaborate even further in the real world of why
this mythological motif of this historical time took place
so and I'm open to it brother I like what I'm what I'm hoping
happens is that you know somehow we can collectively work together and whatever
you know dynamic that is and and come to
further clarity on why this was written the way it was right because
James Valin is a cool guy like I have nothing against the guy like he
like I've said in my audio it's like he's not a wannabe
right he's not he's not somebody who's gonna come and
and say oh you're going to hell because you you teach salvation was only for
Israel right he's he's one of us right I mean he's
he's a truth seeker he's super intelligent so like I have nothing
against him but you know I I just have to be honest to my
convictions of the story and you know saying that
saying that the Romans created a tale that exalts
Israel and and I'm going to get into this soon but you'll see what the final
picture of this story is and it's amazing to me that
it's well I don't want to give anything away we'll get into it but
no thank you okay yeah I'll get back into it here for a
moment and then yeah we'll come back to that so
but we were talking about Romans nine right yep and
and so Paul lofts this one up he says Isaiah also cries out concerning
Israel so clearly here's one of the places where Paul's like showing his
cards you know what I mean and then and then in the last verse he
quotes here in 29 he said and as Isaiah said before
unless the Lord had left us a seed we would have become like Sodom
and made like Gomorrah so in other words Paul asked is God
having mercy on these Gentiles as well and he quotes Isaiah saying unless the
Lord had left us a seed we would have become like Sodom so
to me that shows that there was a seed of Israelites out in the nations
and of course we know there were I mean Josephus even says
you know the 10 tribes are beyond the Euphrates to this day so
we know that there's there's obviously historical proof such as the Maccabees
and all this stuff that do show that there was Israelites out there but I
think Paul is kind of you know building off of that and very
aware that the Israelites were were there and of course he's writing to
Romans who forever for all intents and purposes these were Romans bro these
were you know these were Gentiles by every sense of
the word except for the except for the fact
that they were elect heirs according to the promise
however that works however the black and white
you know lines up I'm not here to say I have all the answers and that
everything's black and white but there is a framework that's laid out
and I believe that when you see what what the final story or the final scene is
when the when the curtain rolls up at the end
you have to understand that these conversion accounts and these elect
ones have to fit into that context Israel and whoever these Romans were
were aware of Old Testament texts whatever you want to say about them
they were they were part of this movement whatever this movement was
so yeah man and and then so moving right along to
Romans 11 another reason obviously we talked about this before Paul is
speaking and he says blindness in part has happened to Israel until the
fullness of the Gentiles has come in and in this way
all Israel will be saved and then he goes on he says as it is written the
deliver will come out of Zion and turn away on godliness from Jacob
or this is my covenant with Jacob when I take away Jacob sins
now notice of course he's using midrash again but again there's a reason he's
using midrash because he's he's conveying a point that's related to
what happened in their history and and so all Israel will be saved and he says
it's going to occur when the deliverer comes out of Zion and establishes a new
covenant with them and that's exactly what Jesus did he came out of Zion
according to the story I should say and he took away their sins and he
established his new covenant with them okay and that and notice how
there's no Gentiles there's no nations there notice how the
Paul says that he would he would establish his new covenant with Jacob
when he takes away Jacob sins right Jacob's not the whole world Jacob is
Israel then if we move on to places like
Ephesians chapter 2 and what I'm doing is I'm just giving you like a
little sampler from each of the books just to show you that the stuff is in
there obviously with your audience if they were
really interested in delving into this a bit more they could
find a couple hundred teachings on my youtube channel where I really go into a
lot of evidence but that's it only a couple hundred
I know right that's and I only started 18 months ago so you can imagine how
many I've done you got to stop that you got to
step those numbers up man that's how I'm just kidding
I know right I got to do one per day man that's like oh
it's a lot and as you can attest it takes a whole
you're a good teacher Jason you really are I like listening to you because
you're very clear you're very concise you say what you mean
we all understand what you say we understand what you're saying you're
there's no ambiguity right and that's why I think it's very
important someone like you is clearly given this to people because
you're helping free people awesome man appreciate that
yeah so back to Ephesians 2 if we look at Ephesians 2 now we see Paul writing
right and and so he says to these ones in Ephesians he says
therefore remember that you once Gentiles in the flesh
who are called on circumcision by what is called the circumcision made in the
flesh by hands now this is what we just talked about right it's like okay
what is Paul saying here is he saying that these ones
were once pagans in their actual meat soup like
they they're their skin bones and bag bag of bones was a Gentile bag of bones
no that's not what Paul is saying at all right
Paul is saying remember that you once Gentile in the flesh that means in the
wiener okay you were uncircumcised you were
like the Gentiles in the flesh of your foreskin
all right and you were called the uncircumcision by what is called the
circumcision made in the flesh by hands now I know people might be like well
that doesn't really make sense why would the Jews call the Israelites
uncircumcision well it's clear from places like John
7 that the Jews were very aware that the Israelites were living amongst the
Gentiles he Jesus is talking to them and he says
where I go you cannot come and they look at each other the
Jews do and they say where does he intend to go does he intend to go to
the the dispersion amongst the nations and teach them
you know in other words so they kind of had this expectation of this restoration
of the kingdom of Israel and I think that you know we're kind of far
removed from that but I do believe that they knew
well they obviously knew because they hated the Samaritans and we see that
very clearly and and that enmity that that that was there was over the law
go figure but yeah there's a lot that can be
said there but he says he goes on he says at that time you were without
Christ being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel
and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God
in the world but now in Christ Jesus you who were once a far off
have been brought near by the blood of Christ well isn't that interesting
because in the beginning when Peter in Acts chapter two
is saying who the promise is for remember he says
he says men of Israel hear these words the promise is to you
to your children and to all who are afar off as many as our Lord will call
well here's paul and where is he he's afar off
and and and he's saying to these ones he's saying but now in Christ Jesus
you who were once a far off you aphesian have now been brought near by the blood
all right and then in verse 14 we see him say this he says for he himself
is our peace who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of
separation having abolished in his flesh
the enmity and then he defines what that is he says that is the law
of commandments contained in ordinances so as to create in himself one who
manned from the two thus making peace and that he might reconcile them both to
God and one body through the cross thereby putting to death the enemy
and he came and preached peace to you who were afar off there it is again
and peace to those who were near well that's exactly what Peter says bro in
Acts 2 the promise is to you Israel and to all who are afar off as many as our
Lord will call here's Paul saying the exact same thing and one little note on
this law enmity if you look at the enmity between the Jews and the
Samaritans and the dispersion and there was just a lot of hostility there
and this is in my opinion what this is all about right when you
when you think of enmity from outside nations over the law
it doesn't really make a lot of sense going all the way back to Israel's
history we can see that for the most part the
outer nations did allow them to you know
live in their own state and in their own communities and especially even in
Babylonian captivity hell they allowed them to worship God they allowed them
to do the things in their law so and and then when we get to the Roman
Empire and the last days and everything you know we know that the
Romans for the most part allowed the Jews the freedom to
practice their own religion so I don't see a lot of enmity over the law
between the Jews and the outer nations in that regard as if the
outer nations were like oh dude the Jews have the law
we're pissed we want that law no it wasn't about that it was to me
was more about the the two sons right and that's
going to take me into my next point the prodigal son parable which I believe
I believe it's one of the most powerful proofs for Israel only that you can find
right I like this one yeah man the prodigal son parable
is very clear to me okay you have these paganized
foreign Israelites who are out in the nations they're dirty
they're unclean they're in the nations they're obviously represented by the
prodigal son but they eventually come back and the
father has mercy upon them just like Moses predicted the
Israelites would would have in Deuteronomy 4 just like Paul said in
Galatians 3 if you're Christ it's because you're in air according to
promise and you've been forgiven so we have the prodigal son coming back to
the father and when we tie that to Romans 9 where Paul
asks is God also merciful to the Gentiles right
we can see that who these Gentiles really were that God was having mercy
upon right they were the Israelites so the prodigal son who's out in the
nations rolling around with the filth represents the paganized
Israelite who was dead in trespasses and sins
right what happens here is that the son who stays home with the father
aka the Jews they were upset when the prodigal son was receiving mercy and
acceptance and we see that in the parable right he's kind of pissed off
about it he's bitter and is this not a perfect
match to what Paul says in Romans 10 where he says that the Jews were being
provoked to jealousy by the mercy that was being shown to their brethren
I mean to me it makes perfect sense that the prodigal son
represents the two houses the Jews who stayed with the father
the paganized Israelite who went out to the nations and they were being
gathered back in and God was having mercy upon them provoking
the Jewish side or the Jewish party to jealousy
okay then if we move along to Colossians
another example very good example here I mentioned it before in Colossians 2
verse 11 he says in him you were also circumcised with the
circumcision made without hands by putting off the body of the sins of the
flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism
in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God who
raised them from the dead and you being dead in your trespasses and the
uncircumcision of your flesh he has made alive together with him
having forgiven you all these trespasses so
here's these elect ones in the nations uncircumcised
dead in trespasses and sins Christ has forgiven them of these trespasses one
of them being uncircumcision and he wiped out the handwriting of
requirements that was against us now if God only declared his laws to
Israel then how are these pagans because Paul says
to these so-called pagans that God that Christ had wiped out the handwriting of
requirements that was against us that's the law
right and he says he has taken it out of the way
nailed it to the cross he disarmed principalities and powers and he made a
public spectacle of them triumphing over them he says so then let no one judge
you in food or drink or regarding a festival or a new moon or a
Sabbath which are a shadow of things to come
and let no one cheat you or of your reward blah blah blah all right and he
says therefore if you died with price from the basic principles of the world
why as though living in the world do you subject yourselves to
regulations do not touch do not taste do not handle well
bro the world that he's talking about there is the world of law
okay he's he's he's saying if you died from the principles of the covenant
world of law then why do you still subject yourselves to these
regulations all right and and so you know the world
and the law and everything that's just so apparently clear that it's
it's Israel because he came to his own for God so loved the world that he gave
his only son the world is Israel he came he was born into the
law to redeem those under the law but the point here is that this
Colossians portion here is very eye-opening because the ones that are
receiving the mercy in Colossae had handwritten requirements against them
and they were dead because they were on circumcised and they were trespassing
a covenant commandment all right in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 a very eye
opening verse 1 here Paul's writing to these so-called
pagans right and look what he says he says more over brethren
I do not want you to be unaware that all of our fathers were under the cloud
all of them passed through the Red Sea and all of them were baptized into Moses
in the cloud and in the sea so wait a minute
why is Paul telling pagans that their fathers passed through the Red Sea and
were baptized into Moses just doesn't make sense
the Israelites were the ones who came through the sea
and were baptized into Moses so Paul is writing to Israelites in Corinth
both you and Gentile all right Paul also says in in the same book I believe
that he was conducting a ministry of reconciliation
now why would a pagan need to be reconciled to God
he never knew God to begin with Amos 3 says very clearly that you Israel alone
of all the families of the earth have I known
so why would anyone need to be reconciled to someone who they never knew to
begin with that's like me saying that I'm going to be reconciled to a lady named
Nancy who lives in Australia who I never met before
right it doesn't make any sense all right if
this is the prodigal son again man this is the reconciliation of the prodigal
son coming back to the father you can't come
back to the father unless you have the father to begin with
that's what reconciliation is all about all right
Israel near and Israel afar off sheep here and sheep out of this fold
then of course when we move into the epistle of Peter and we look at verse
one we see exactly who he wrote to right he says in
verse one Peter an apostle to the pilgrims of the dispersion
in Pontus Galatia Asia Capodatia by Thinia
elect according to the foreknowledge of God so
Peter's epistles were written to the dispersed ones in Pontus Galatia in Asia
now is anyone going to deny who the Diaspora was I mean these are Israelites
right now I know some people would argue that the Diaspora here is speaking of
the Jews I would say it's more of a generalized
Jew and Gentile inclusive type deal where of course we know that there were
Israelites who left the Jewish practice and who went
out there because I just gave you a billion examples and of course we know
the Maccabees and everything so there were Israelites who were out in the
nations and I believe it's all encompassing when Peter writes to them
here well James does it too James exactly early
says to the law to the 12 you know exactly brother
that so this isn't just written to Jews this isn't just
you know the southern tribes this is the full body of the 12 tribes
which of course then again proves that the 12 tribes were still there
right and they had some kind of tie or some kind of knowledge or whatever the
case may be but but Peter addresses his epistle
to them and then what's interesting is in his second
epistle written to the same people by the way because Peter says
I stir you up a second time in this second epistle
and so he's writing to them again and look what he says in 2 Peter 3 verse 14
he says therefore beloved looking forward to these things we
diligent to be found by him in peace without spot and blameless
and consider that the long suffering of our Lord is salvation
now pay attention he says as also our beloved brother
Paul according to the wisdom given to him has written
to you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things
so Peter is actually telling his audience that
they received the pistols from Paul as well the same audience
right now I've heard all kinds of arguments and all kinds of
you know ways to try to wiggle out of that but it just won't work
right but Peter is clearly saying that Paul wrote
to the elect of the dispersion in these regions and wouldn't you know
he actually listed in 1 Peter 1 1 certain regions he listed Galatia
right we know Paul wrote to the Galatians he listed Asia
we know we have the seven churches of Asia we know Ephesus was in Asia we know
Colossae was in Asia so we have all these epistles of
these individual places that Paul was writing to
and we have Peter telling the dispersed ones that Paul wrote to them
right so just just something to keep in mind and I think it's very powerful
then as you mentioned there's the book of James which is written to the 12 tribes
it wasn't written to you or I although some people still claim that it's written
to them it was written to all 12 tribes scattered
abroad notice it's not written only to the Jews like you just mentioned
it shows that James was still aware of the existence of all 12 tribes in the
surrounding regions and ironically this matches John verse
I'm sorry John let's see I think it's John 11 hang on
um yeah John 11 the plot to kill Jesus right it says in verse 49 speaking of
Caiaphas and one of them Caiaphas being high priest that year said to them
you know nothing at all nor do you consider that is that it is
expedient for us that one man should die for the people and not that the whole
nation should perish now this he did not say on his
on his own authority but being high priest that year he prophesied
that Jesus would die for the nation and not only for that nation ready
but also that he would gather together in one the children of God who were
scattered abroad okay now scattered abroad so
Caiaphas prophesied that Christ was gathering the children of God who were
scattered abroad James writes his letter to the 12 tribes
scattered abroad so who in the hell do you think the
children of God who are being gathered in are they're the 12 times
and what you're going to see at the end when the curtain rolls up
is only the 12 tribes in heaven but we'll get to that in a minute
the book of Acts as well has much to say about the Israelites
some is confusing some is very clear we have to kind of look for it
but if we're aware of these things we can see it literally peppered throughout
the entire book in Acts chapter 1 verse 6 we see something
amazing that is asked of Jesus and I don't think we pay enough attention to
this all right they look at Jesus and they say to him
they come together and they ask him saying Lord will you at this time
restore the kingdom to Israel okay now that's what their expectation was
okay that's what their hope was and by golly that's exactly what's taking
place here all right let me read you something from
a scholar from the New Testament
he's a professor of New Testament from the University of South Africa
his name's J. E. Batha I'm pronouncing that correctly
he wrote this about John 316 and the world he says
the Jewish atmosphere of the conversation rendered in John 3
dominates the context if that is one would let the verse speak for itself
the participants in this conversation are Nicodemus a Jewish ruler a well-to-do
person a member of the urban elite and Jesus also a Jew a kind of rabbi
whom Nicodemus approached during the night to speak about what he was doing
the conversation itself centers around becoming a partaker of the kingdom of
God which was a Jewish concept by new birth a
subject and theme which specifically and exclusively encompassed
Israel the people of God God's reign over Israel had to be
reinstated and being children of God was something to be strived for
now that calls to remembrance acts 26 which I'll bring to your attention in a
minute where Paul says that the 12 tribes
served God earnestly day and night hoping to attain right
and then we have here the scholar continues he says entrance into God's
domain are taking in God's patronage experiencing new life by faith in the
Son of Man as but one precondition to be born anew
thereby acquiring a new birth status and consequently
a new honor rating and becoming part of God's kinship group
family or fictive kinship group the verse does not function in
in a context where the discussion centers around universal categories and
universal acceptance of Jesus it is firmly rooted in the context
of the salvation of Israel in general and the acceptance of Jesus by
Israel specifically references to the Son of Man
Moses raising up of the serpent and belief and unbelief in Israel firmly
placed this utterance in the context of Israel
and God and Jesus is dealings with Israel alone
okay if you want me to mention something about that because I think this is
important what you're saying I agree um you got what your your position is
actually a step further in explaining the further
details in the epistles and the letters as to what because this scholar
he's probably clearly hitting the nail on the head right here but later on
I bet if you read him and I hate this about this stuff because
they're trying they're trying but they get to these other places and then they
go oh yeah well these guys these are the
freaking you know these guys are really different but I like how cohesive
this message you're presenting is Jason I just want to stop
say this is very interesting how how cohesive this is so please keep
going yeah and so and um let's see I had something I wanted to chime in you
just made me think of something here um scholars uh
shit maybe it'll come back to me um hold on one second hold on one second
sorry yeah
sorry about that that's all right the wife is like how much longer you guys
have to go for two hours so okay let's oh yeah the wife's wanting me to hurry up
wrap it up I said don't worry we're coming close so yeah we're definitely
getting close I got just a few things and I'll I'll try to just kind of breeze
through it and if you have something that you think you want to really ask me
then just cut me off right well oh yeah go through that and then I want to get
into Adam so if you want to just flow straight from that because I know
Romans 5 everyone goes to Romans 5 everybody all in
Adam and it's important to know where to start in
order to know where to end and I'd like to go from whatever you're about to go
into just jump right into it I won't even ask
I just I think it's important people understand Adam if they're even going to
come to this because that's what the church does
usually you know you got some more intelligent positions but
yeah Adam's the he's the man the first man of all humanity right
absolutely not so much but yeah sure yeah that's what I'm saying so yeah
but um all right so we were we were talking about acts before I quoted the
scholar there and so in act chapter two we see
again like I had mentioned before um you know this
this last age Peter tells him hey that you know what you're seeing here is what
the prophet Joel spoke of and this is taking place and then he
goes on he says in repent let everyone be baptized and you shall receive the gift
of the Holy Spirit excuse me he says for the promises to you your children and
to all who are far off as many as our Lord will call
and so you have this this expectation that Israel near and Israel far off are
coming back which I spoke about then if we jump over to act chapter five we see
again here in verse 30 it says the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you
murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be
prince and savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins so
again very clear statement who christ came to give repentance and forgiveness
of sins to and no it wasn't the whole world it was
Israel then if we look in act chapter 13 uh let's see verse um
22 it says and when he had removed him he raised up for them David as king to
whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a
man after my own heart who will do all my will from this man's seed
according to the promise god raised up for Israel
a savior Jesus all right again seeing that it's for Israel there
and then what I just mentioned in acts 26 here's Paul standing before king of
grippa and look what he tells him he says he says they knew me from the first
if they were willing to testify that according to the strictest set of our
religion I lived as a Pharisee and now here I am I stand and I'm judged for
the hope of the promise made by god to our fathers
to this promise our 12 tribes earnestly serving god day and night hope to
attain well again that goes back to the scholarly
quote I just mentioned where we see that it was Israel's expectation
it was Israel's hope and Israel's kingdom restoration that they were looking for
and I think acts 1 6 really shows that but if we look about this promise here
that Paul says that to this promise our 12 tribes
serve god hoping to attain well remember Galatians 3 where Paul says
doesn't matter if you're Jew or Greek if you're Abraham seed you're in air
according to promise well there's the promise again
so here in acts 26 Paul says to this promise our 12 tribes are hoping to
attain and here's Paul in Galatians 3 saying if
doesn't matter if you're a Jew or a Greek if you're Christ it's because you're
Abraham seed and in air according to the promise
so again who were those ones getting the gospel they were the elect
they were the 12 tribes of Israel all right and so
that's about all I got for acts just to kind of move things along here
I know we went up we went over all this stuff here but
those are just some of the main reasons why I think that the Bible you know
really portrays what I'm what I'm teaching nicely
then of course you know when I when I talked earlier before we get into Adam
here real quick I was talking about the curtain rolling up at the end and
seeing you know the final scene and you know it's interesting because
you know people look at the book of revelation
and they kind of don't know what they're doing right some of them take it
chronologically some of them think it's obviously talking about the
future they just really don't know which way is up there
but if we look at the revel the book of revelation
we can see that this is different pictures of the same scene kind of
bouncing around and sometimes you might have a picture of
you know the mother of all harlots Jerusalem being destroyed
and then in the very next breath you'll you'll be thrown into the midst of the
throne room in heaven and you'll be standing there with the final
scene of all the elect standing singing salvation songs and rejoicing
because they've been redeemed so you kind of have to have a good ebb and
flow as to where this is going and not always like
take it chronologically you have to be able to jump around and say okay you
know what John's getting into a different vision here what is this you
know but revelation in the 14th chapter says
very very clearly and this is such an ironclad dagger man
it says that only the 12 tribes could learn the redemption song
it says that the 12 tribes were the only ones who could learn the redemption
song because they were redeemed from the earth now
if only the 12 tribes could learn the redemption song
then who are the ones being redeemed in all the epistles and all the accounts
and all the conversion accounts they have to fall under that 12
tribe 144,000 context does that make sense
oh yeah absolutely and i agree uh i think that's
very important especially when you start seeing the numerology
yes i look at i look at numerology too and
about 144 Jesus sent out 72 disciples according to Luke 10
what's 72 144 yeah and there's so much with that too like that's that's
something i haven't really sunk my teeth into yet
but obviously i know there's a ton of stuff there with all the symbolism in
the years and all that but um yeah but yeah i mean
Revelation 14 is just a locket drop it type passage where
you can't you can't defeat that right if it says only the 144k could learn the
redemption song because only they were redeemed from the earth
then we have to allow that to mold our understanding of the epistles and the
last days and understand that yes everybody who was saved fits into that
category if we look at Revelation chapter five it
shows them singing that song and and again remember that 14 says
only the Israelites could sing the song here in Revelation five we see them
singing the song and it says that God had called them quote
out from every nation tribe in tongue called out from is very important to
take note of because that was what the ecclesia was it was what the church was
it was the called out ones all right and they were called out from every nation
tribe in tongue God was seeking his sheep the lost sheep of Israel
they were being called out being called out from the nations is a lot different
than the nations themselves being saved all right
then if we look at Revelation seven it shows again that only the 12 tribes were
getting the sealing of the Holy Spirit in those last days
John hears the number and it's the 144k or the 12 tribes
that's very important to take notice of because remember we have in all the
epistles we see these ones being sealed on the forehead
and John in Revelation seven says the 12 tribes were the ones being sealed
then in the same chapter in verse nine he looks and now he sees that same group
and describes them as a great multitude from all nations standing in heaven
and they're celebrating crying out salvation belongs to our God remember
who were the ones who could learn the redemption song the 12 tribes
so who are these ones standing in heaven singing the salvation song crying out
salvation belongs to our God this is the 12 tribes
okay and remember these are these are portrayed as
I'm sorry I lost my train of thought there so I guess I should ask why are
these random foreigners singing a salvation song in Revelation chapter seven
if only the Israelites are the ones who could learn that song in Revelation 14
is that a contradiction no the answer is that they are not foreigners they are
the 12 tribes having been gathered in from all nations where they were
from scattered abroad this was the great commission to take the good news far
and wide before his coming and before the end came
to seal all the elect which are the 144k and when the fullness of those nations
came in all Israel would be saved also consider that if
Revelation seven great multitude is not the 12 tribes like I am
asserting then where the hell did the 12 tribes go
did they just not get the promise did they not receive the Holy Spirit
in Revelation chapter seven verses one to eight and then just suddenly not make
it to heaven because only the great multitude from the
nations is shown standing in heaven in the latter part of Revelation seven
nobody else is there so if two different groups of people
where did the 12 tribes go did they miss the cut
no they didn't miss any cut this is the 12 tribes
scattered abroad as James wrote they were gathered in from all nations and
yes that included Judea as well but that is an
all-encompassing picture of the 12 tribes and by golly that fulfills the
promise that in Abraham's seed many nations would be blessed
all right it's it's the it's the sheep of this
fold and the sheep not of this fold it's the Israel near and the Israel afar
off it's the sheep that he came to preach peace near and far
that Paul spoke of in Ephesians then of course there's Revelation 21 which shows
only the 12 tribes names written on the new city in heaven
nobody else has their names on it again the point is that no matter
what our view is of who is actually getting saved in the last days
the conclusion and the final picture is there for the taking and it's there for
us to see there's no secrets there the only ones redeemed
were the 12 tribes of Israel in the end the only ones who got the Holy Spirit
were the 12 tribes the only ones singing this
salvation song in the end were the 12 tribes and the only ones with their
names on the city were the 12 tribes so when the scroll
rolls up and the curtain comes up and you look into the throne room of heaven
at the very end of the story when all the parts are fulfilled and
everything's done and all the elect is sealed and Christ has come and the new
heaven and the new earth this year who you see standing with Tori's
you see the 12 tribes of Israel all right now moving right along here i'm
trying to speed this up because i'm also getting a little tired myself
well you're putting a lot of content down so
i'm gonna go into adam here and then and hopefully we can wrap this up
so obviously people would object to my view because of adam they would say
hey adam represents all humanity in some way
for one man sin entered the world right exactly but again remember now what
that world actually was but we'll come back to that
it's i disagree with their conclusions here although i haven't fully figured out
adam yet i'll be up front about that i do have an idea of what he
was or what he represented now there's no doubt that adam represents the law in
some way the giving of the law and the coming
under its wrath and combination paul in roman's chapter five in roman's
chapter seven sheds a whole ton of light on this as he speaks of adam
we can see obvious parallels between what he says there and what happened in the
garden paul says in roman's five that sin was
in the world before the law but sin is not imputed without the law
so firstly the question needs to be asked who was the world there
well it's obviously those under the law and nobody further
take for example two chapters earlier in roman's three
look how paul describes the world here he says now we know whatever the law says
it says to those who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all
the world may become guilty before god so we can see here that paul
qualifies the world as those under the law so would we dare think that his
definition of the world would radically change just two chapters later
and now include all humanity of course not the world was those under the law
for god so loved the world he so loved israel that he gave his only begotten
son for that that whosoever within the limited confines of israel of
course would believe would not perish but have
everlasting life paul also said jesus was born into
the law to redeem those under the law again we see exactly the world that god
so loved and since we know only israel had god's law in this
story we can then clearly see that jesus only came for israel and if i'm not
mistaken he said just that didn't he anyways back to roman's chapter five
it's clear that without law to impute sin there is no imputed sin for anyone
which means that the curse and the story of salvation pertained only to those
under the law notice what paul says in romans five
about what adam's transgression brought to the people
he says this for if by one man's offense many
died much more the grace of god and the gift
by the grace of the one man jesus christ abounded to many
and the gift is not like that which came through the one who sin
for the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation
but the free gift which came from many offenses which resulted in justification
now very important to take note of we see what adam's
offense brought with it don't we it brought two things
it brought death and it brought condemnation and i want to repeat that
so you remember those two things the at the offense of adam in the garden
brought with it death and it brought with it condemnation
right out of the words of paul and roman's chapter five
please remember those two things and let's take a look at second currently in
chapter three where paul is speaking about the law notice what he calls the
law here pay attention remember those two things death and condemnation
paul says but if the ministry of death written and engraved on stones
was glorious so that the children of israel could not look steadily at the
face of moses because of the glory of its countenance
which glory was passing away how will the ministry of the spirit not be more
glorious for if the ministry of condemnation had glory
then the ministry of righteousness seemed much more in glory now
what did i just show you there well i showed you paul flat out saying that it
was the law that brought that brought condemnation and death
yeah are you catching that yeah okay so paul says that uh the very same two
things that adam's offense brought to the people death and condemnation
he says that the law brought death and condemnation
so obviously to me this means that the entire story of adam is about the law
and it's about the death and condemnation and the burden and the bondage that
came with it adam broke the law and sin was imputed
that was the day that he died that was the day that condemnation began
take note of what else paul says in roman's chapter seven about adam
now notice how adam in the garden is all over this portion paul says this he
says for apart from the law sin was dead
i was alive once without the law but when the commandment came
sin lived and i died and the commandment which was to bring life i found to
bring death for sin taking opportunity by the
commandment deceived me and by it fooled me now notice how paul says that he was
alive once without the law sin was dead it had no killing
power at that time because the law wasn't given yet
this is the same time frame that paul spoke of two chapters earlier in
roman's five when he said sin was in the world before the law but sin wasn't
imputed that is exactly what i was alive
once without the law means paul is speaking in the person and
position of adam here and referring back to the time when adam was
walking in the garden before the commandment came
remember how adam was walking before the law came he was naked
he was unashamed he had no guilt his eyes were closed
he had no awareness of his offenses no imputed sin
no need of a covering all right and no the eyes being closed doesn't mean that
his eyes were sewn shut it just means that he wasn't aware of
this guilt because no matter there is no law there's no imputed sin
all right and paul said he would not even have had known what coveting
covet this was if the law didn't say thou shalt not covet
all right but notice what paul says when the commandment came he says when the
law came from god or when the commandment came
the sin that was already present but not yet imputed
sort of takes occasion opportunity by the commandment
and paul gives the illustration of sin sprawling up and pulling to life
and bringing death with it paul even describes the sin as deceiving him and
killing him interestingly i see a little bit of a serpent
motif there obviously this is almost a perfect
illustration of adam in the garden you have adam in the garden with no
imputation of sin walking naked not ashamed
eyes closed no guilt alive then the commandment comes
sin takes opportunity by it and brings the death
deceives them and so it begins the common theme from cover to cover is that the
law was bondage and it brought with it death and condemnation
ironically paul said christ was the end of the law to those who believed
again showing that christ was only pertinent to those under the law
paul also said that there is no condemnation to those in christ
well if the law was the ministry of condemnation as paul called it
then clearly those in christ would have would have no more condemnation
was also limited to those under the law we see that christ's death
and his his gift took away the condemnation and death that adam's
offense brought with it and if christ was the end of the law
and he did away with that curse then we can clearly see how adam's
transgression heavily was linked to the law so much more can be said here but i
urge people to check out some of my older videos on my youtube channel for
much more on that particular possibility
another possible option for adam is that he was representative of israel
you may have heard the saying adam is israel our buddy ryan provost has a
great video on adam that he shared early on and he proves
biblically how adam was israel i am very open to this
opinion as well although i'm not fully there adam
he sees adam as sort of a foreshadowing of israel or that he even was israel
for many centuries jewish scholars have noticed associations between the early
chapters of genesis and israel's history as it unfolds in the pentateu as well
as in the rest of the bible jewish scholars noted
textual and historical patterns from genesis one to three
replicated elsewhere in the biblical recorded history of israel
scholar paul morris wrote a pattern is forged in the bible linking the
precise details of the creation of the world to the creation of israel
based on associated biblical readings to establish that the world
was created only for israel i find that quote interesting
among many others that i have come across because it somewhat jives with
what myself and many others have been saying
i just touched upon this a few minutes ago as well
that being that when the bible uses the term the world especially in the new
testament it is usually speaking of the covenant world of israel
those under the law morris in that quote seems to also recognize that the
creation of the world is at the very least related to the creation of israel
as god's people by the way david king did a marvelous
audio on john 316 where he exhaustively shows just this
he sent me the rough draft audio and i wanted to share it because it was that
good but he wants to wait until he goes on ryan provost show
before i share that so anyways yeah he crushes that
that all the world argument and and all the objections to it
and he shows very clearly that the world that god so loved was the covenant
world of israel so stay tuned for that yeah ryan provost shows
or his youtube channel be down in my description as well as david king in
case you guys are wondering awesome yeah i know that's coming soon
but anyways moving right along the genesis rabah also has some very
interesting things to say about adam for those who may not be familiar with it
what it is it's a religious text from judyism's classical period probably
written between 300 and 500 ce with some later editions but it's
basically a midrash collection of ancient rabbinical interpretations of the
book of genesis particularly the early chapters and i've read bits and
pieces of it but some of it really jives with my position
adam's violation of the divine law and his punishment of curse and exile for
shadow israel's subsequent failure to keep the Torah
and their punishment of curse and exile i've been saying for over three years
now that adam and his story is one of a covenant creation
or at the very least adam was surely in covenant with the god of the bible
as is evident with the lush promised land the walking with god
the giving and receiving of god's law and so on while many agree with me there
many people have also object objected to that position as well
take this portion of the genesis rabah from chapter 19
verse nine for example it says quote and the lord god called to the man
how are you yesterday of my opinion but now of the opinion of the serpent
yesterday from the end of the world and until its end and now in the midst of
the trees of the garden rabbi avihu said in the name of rabbi
hanina it is written in hosea 6 and they transgress the covenant
like adam they are like the first man
what of the first man i brought him into the midst of the garden of eden and i
commanded him and he transgressed my commandment
i judged him with sending away and casting out and i more
for him how i brought him into the midst of the garden of eden
of which it is said i brought him into the garden of eden and i commanded him
of which it is said and the lord god commanded adam
end quote so this quote if you're a little confused it continues on about
adam's violation of the law and how it relates to israel but i think what's
important to take note of there is the fact that these rabbis in the first
few centuries ad did actually believe and hold to some
position that adam was in covenant with god so many people have fought me on the
hosea passage that explicitly states this they argue that it
doesn't actually say adam was in covenant but it surely does
and if you notice how the rabbis worded it there in that quote i will read it
again he says it is written in hosea 6 and
they transgressed the covenant like adam
okay there can be no denying that at least some of the rabbis held my
position that adam was in covenant with god
morris continues and says finally there is the related theme of the eventual
redemption of israel as the ultimate overcoming of the sin of adam
that's genesis rabah 21 uh and chapter 21 verse 1 there were many scholars who
saw the similarity many other scholars i should say who saw
similarities between adam and israel in the bible
some of them include joseph blankensaw who wrote
quote genesis 3 can be viewed as a mythological interpretation of
israelite religious history from the time of the settlement
i know you'd like that one or carlos boville who draws parallels between
the serpent and the canaanites and adam's mandate to conquer their land and
israel's mandate to do the same boville's primary
thesis was that genesis 321 and the garments of skin represent an
attempt on the part of the exilic writers to explain the
exile to current and following readers that israel had in fact become just
like the evil inhabitants of canaan they had not kept the Torah and
therefore they were no longer worthy of the land
or then there's scholar martin emirich whose work provides a rare attempt to
understand the temptation narrative as part of the pentate
emirich sees parallels between the gift of the garden and the gift of the
promised land as do i or brian toves whose argument was much
broader than others and that he argues that genesis one to four
is the introduction proper to the entire old testament and its theology
then there is william j dumbbell who notes that both adam and israel share
royal priestly roles both enjoy the conditional provision of a
divinely prepared land and both lose access to that land
due to their transgression and exile there are many scholars who might never
knew believe this type of view i found i found out about them when i
personally came to this conclusion myself it was one of those
hey did anyone else believe this two moments and of course it led me to find
many quotes and opinions on the matter mix that in with the fact that the
ancient rabbis also believed and taught that adam both had the law and was
in covenant with god and it seems like my conclusions are not far off at all
in a nutshell you have the exact same elements found in the garden story as
you do with israel you have adam in the garden you have israel in the land of
jerusalem the promised land you have adam's transgressing and and banished
from the garden you have israel transgressing the covenant and banished
from jerusalem god takes adam and brings him into the lush blooming garden
perhaps out of a formless and void world with no knowledge of god god takes israel
out from egypt and brings them into a lush blooming garden ironically the land
of jerusalem is actually referred to plainly as the garden of eden and the
garden of god by azekiel the prophet again leaving the door wide open for
adam and the garden of eden to be in some way symbolic of israel and the
promised land that god gave them anyways there's a lot of similarities there
which is why i remain open to that option as well adam is israel and the final
option that i'll talk about today just super briefly is that adam was the
first father of israel and the very first person that the jews referred back
to when they discussed the origins of their exclusive law we know that paul
himself took israel's law history all the way back to adam to the one man who
brought death into the world as i just showed you from romans five and seven
so it's not far-fetched to think that maybe the jews would have also taken
their patriarchal backstory all the way back to him as well we know that jewish
writings such as tobit refer to noah as the jews early ancestors uh i'm sorry
the the early writing tobit refers to noah as being an earliest ancestor of the
jews adam could also just be a microcosm of israel as well who really knows
but the one thing that i'm certain of is that it relates to and is certainly
involved with the law which was what brought condemnation and death
there is no way around that fact the law has to be a central part of the garden
story of adam and sure enough paul confirms that it was in nearly all of
his letters whatever the case may be though the curse went away at the end
of the story which was at hand when the book of
revelation was written and which was linked to the fall of the temple and
the end of the law so um i'm going to leave it at that bro but that just
gives you a little bit of my thoughts on adam there's a few different ways it
can go i'm still working it out um i am open to him being allegory for israel
or just maybe just a place to be israeli to refer to back in their history
because i i hold the um the uh view of genesis that it was written during
Babylonian captivity right all the exiles and i and i believe that um that
can be proved by comparing it to Ezekiel and Jeremiah who were other
Babylonian captivity prophets and we see so much of the same uh words being
used in those prophetic texts as we do in genesis the garden of Eden the garden
of god you know all these things it's a there's a lot of that in my book the
genesis of israel too um not that i'm plugging it because i you know
whatever but but uh yeah and so a lot a lot to be
said there but that's about where i'm going to leave it for your brother um
do you have anything you want to ask or add or do that uh that
there's a lot to search okay there's a lot to search and uh i like how you've
done a good job of being cohesive this whole show right here is to allow the
audience to chew they're going to need to listen to this and chew
if you guys can contribute in any way um maybe adding
more thought to what we've already talked about on the show or you might see
something you personally say hey i don't see it that way feel free to comment
however it's not going to hurt mine or his feelings
because we don't have any any stake in in this
however um this is this makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways i know Luther
my co-host actually takes a late date of adam or the genesis story he says
he believes that um adam is israel and he said that he has his reasons and he
also says uh he thinks it comes much later almost like the other stories
were older and that genesis is slapped on if you will later on
i know philo of alexandria uh he takes the allegorical approach
to the the old testament so there's so much to research jason
i'm glad you came on this is a very good show i believe full of content
anyone who watches this should have a lot of respect and say you know okay
it's time that we we start digging in and challenging this position because
the only way that you're going to better something or figure out the truth is
is to critique and i like this i could see a lot of
different avenues in my mind you know this makes a lot of
sense but i mean you know i'm going to keep an open mind
however this is this is this does a very good thing so
i want to try and explore other avenues using this uh this whole cohesive
cohesive story because it's easy to see
based on what you talked about with the gentiles talking about these people
who are non-circumcised like you start removing
removing circumcision start removing what you have to eat
okay start removing these things you're gonna get these uh
outsiders willing to hijack the stan thing and say hey hey that's talking about
us you know uh so i really appreciate it bro you
have any last words you have to say and i got to close out here
yeah man i don't want to get you in trouble with the wifey but um
i would just say uh first of all i appreciate you know you having me on and
giving me a chance to speak to your audience who
i see is growing every day you're doing awesome stuff man your videos are great
so appreciate that keep up the good work uh the other thing i would say is to
anyone who um maybe you don't you don't agree with me on
everything maybe you like some of the stuff i said and it
resonates with you and you get it and you want to you know follow me along in
my journey uh i would just invite you to subscribe to the
channel um i you know i started 18 months
ago roughly maybe not maybe less than that but
um i've got a few hundred people that have subscribed and you know in the
world of youtube that's nothing right i mean i'm a nobody in terms of
that but what i'd like to think is that the people who are subscribing are
the intellectuals the the ones who have a desire to piece this thing together
who haven't been able to kick it right um but but want the answers and want to
know more and so i would just invite you to subscribe um
engage in the activity uh you know in the videos
you know listen to offer up you know commentary whatever it is
the only thing i do ask and and you you know this i'm kind of an asshole
sometimes um if if somebody approaches me
in a condescending way i'm not like jesus man i can't turn the cheek you know
what i mean like that's and that's one thing i respect
about you particularly bro is that you know you people come at you and and
you know and i've heard actually you know who told me uh is michael
barris um who's a good friend of mine he said you
know people come at derrick and and he just he's so cool about it like he just
doesn't get mad you know and i respect that and i wish i was
like that for all of my italian temper and everything
it just you know so if you come at me with a sword
i'm gonna pull out an ak you know 15 and i'm gonna blow you away
47 but you know the bottom line is if you respect me with uh with your words
and and come on poorly i'm gonna give you the same
response so even if we disagree i just ask that if you are going to come at
and engage just be respectful and and you'll get the same level of respect
back from me that's all i agree i can take the punches better than
i'll tell you this like uh recently had a situation on facebook i'll leave the
guy unnamed but he came at um richard carrier
now i work with richard carrier yep i work with him right
you can talk about me all day i can take the punches okay you're not gonna
hurt me i know what i am i know who i am
yeah you can't fuck with me okay i've been in the darkest i've probably been
in much darker places than you can imagine so i'm like okay
whatever sticks and stones may break my bones right but when you talk about
someone else who's not there to defend themselves
you know and and you literally say hey i'm trying to sabotage this person or
you're trying to go out of your way to harm someone and i work with this person
right dude i'm gonna block you i have no i'm not dealing with you
however um look i know this shit strikes a bone was most
most people even those who are non-believers they say it's easy for
the man to leave the religion but it's very difficult for the religion to leave
the man and i really have seen that for those who
go around saying i'm an agnostic or i'm a i'm an atheist
but you can see remnants of things and we all are trying to deconstruct in some
way however like price said it's got its claws
we're always gonna probably be into researching this thing so
yeah but i i do think that we're in a unique period of history here where
you know we have all these resources and and and quite a good crop of brilliant
minds and and we're working together to kind of chisel
at it and i think that we're probably closer to the truth of the bible than
any generations before us right so you know it's exciting to
where it might go but uh yeah man i just i appreciate the opportunity and
hopefully we'll be able to do this again and
maybe next time i'll show my ugly mug hey that'll work
and and and by the way for those of you who are listening
you know if you see in the new testament
during the documenting of these texts that there's already
other gospels there's already antichrists
there's already a plethora of ideas going on
in the writing of these texts no wonder we have so much crazy you know
denominations and different eastern orthodox oh no roman
there's a variety of different christianities and and you all you got to
do is go to the text itself it'll tell you there's different gospels going on
already paul tells so keep that in mind um when when you
consider well which one is the one true i don't think we'll ever freaking know i
think we're just trying to figure it out and i think the closest you can get to
a midrash jewish kind of uh a hella nice jewish type of message here in my
opinion i think you're getting closer to what's really going on
jason thanks for joining me man and um go subscribe to his channel everybody
this is myth vision what can i say you know what i'm saying
we're just gonna evolve bro we're just gonna keep going with the flow and i
hope i have you back on bro uh i would like to have you back on if we can do
that man and now that you see that we really do
like you know we're like what's up yeah you know it's cool man it's just it's
just a matter of time and working things out so that uh i actually do get
married and don't ruin things before you
oh lord yeah man you know it and i'm i'm gonna lose my marriage if i don't get
out of here so go give that wifey some love in that
thanks brother
