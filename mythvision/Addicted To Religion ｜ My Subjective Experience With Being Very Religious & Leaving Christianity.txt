What's up everybody big D Derek Lambert check it out myth vision podcast and all my fans
anyone who's watched anyone who loves what we do thanks for listening I'm gonna kind
of roast myself today I hope you guys enjoy this because I'm actually gonna show you guys
from when I was extremely religious now I personally help people who are in recovery
or people who are drug addicts who struggle with drug addiction to get help you know to
to make it to a normal place in their life and I actually do believe personally for my
own experience that's all I can do is tell you that that I had an addiction to religion
helped me escape reality the world that we live in it helped me escape this place now
of course I was raised I had traumas everyone has traumas I think everybody's addicted to
something some way shape or form but I was using religion to kind of escape this reality
I mean imagine it's kind of platonic you know there's a world outside of this world you
look forward to to the point where I actually would have dreams as a fundamentalist Christian
that the world's gonna come to an end the rapture is gonna happen the world's gonna burn
with fire why would I want to have children bringing them into a world that's gonna burn
up right so you have that type of eschatology attached to the religion but there's so many
things I could poke at Christianity or even just religion in general and say there are
some obviously pros that maybe happen but are they pros because of religion or they pros
because humans recognized that really we gotta coexist we gotta try and get along with
other humans and try to be as best person we can to help other humans without getting
into all that this is not to be a technical video and talking about all these things
and going into belief systems and stuff I wanted to kind of clown on myself and let
you guys see the kind of stuff that I did like I grew my freaking beard out and the
way I looked it was it was crazy I mean I've done a lot of different things you know growing
up from punk rock you know hardcore heavy metal to hip hop to you know being a sports
jock to you know you name it man I practically done it it's it's I'm all over the board
and I was trying to find out who I was well I think I found who I am today and I'm still
learning who I am but I no longer have to strive to know everything I have to be right
that was a big no no for me I had to be right about everything I had to know the truth and
that was it and now I'm starting to realize how much I don't know and it's it's really
refreshing so let's look at me years ago when I was extremely religious and clown on
me a little bit here we go alright so here's the phases I went through I was first a fundamentalist
like a John Hagey type fundamentalist somewhat I mean not John Hagey so to speak but eschatology
wise and I was Zionist so you'll see of course I loved the art I still to this day think
the art's pretty cool some of these are not as old pictures somehow are mixed in there
but here we start to move up you'll see I had like a fantastic idea of Jesus you know
coming on the clouds and you know this revelation idea of Jesus well as I started to move on
and you could see like Jiu Jitsu right I was very fundamentalist Zionist and I move on
and bump into somebody who introduced me to Calvinism and showed me like how the doctrine
works it's systematic and such systematic theology starts to kind of try to make sense
it's a very good harmonization tool to try and make sense of these things and Dr. Bob's
like you know his whole point is not trying to harmonize not all these texts teach the
same thing same doctrines some are contradictory some are contradictory within their own text
that's a New Testament critical scholar for you now John Calvin you know Martin Luther
John Calvin other reformers I was big into this movement and you'll see that in just
a minute like monergism the idea that it's one work God does all the work and man's free
will has nothing to do with salvation whatsoever I used to look at acts right here 1348 as
many as were ordained to eternal life believed the idea that God preordains and makes sure
that those he chose are going to be saved etc. I got into that big time in fact you're
about to see like you can see my beard here like I got straight up Amish and shit like
I just I really went into this so deep I already showed you that book let me show you so my
brother and I like here's one right here let's see this is GK Bill the book of Revelation I was
big into into research in this stuff here's a church my brother went to like a recovery camp
trying to get off drugs and I went over here and like come on dude I'm posing for a picture with
my hands out and being so pious to pray in front of a camera but I really was trying to be you know
like a I guess a good Christian oh here's a good one check out my swagger man I thought I was hot
stuff here I was the Amish pimp like straight up let me get on my wagon and horse in this
B hatch let's see let's see let me pull up this one so you guys can see better look at this beard
I had so like I just freaking let it grow like wild and stuff let me do this
just just Amish pimp right there y'all I got my I got my wife's and we're off in the middle
of nowhere running our own cult you know I was a reformed Presbyterian at this time and this was
my pastor here I was excommunicated from that church I stopped going and the reason I stopped
going is because my like what I started finding out in terms of my research at the time was there
was a doctrine of full preterism and it's the idea that you know the New Testament teaches
these time statements that things are supposed to happen the Eschaton or the Perusia the Parasia
however you want to pronounce it it's supposed to happen soon it's not supposed to be stretched
out 2,000 years or happen sometime down the road and I finally cut my beard somewhere around this
time so I ended up going to meeting a guy Don Fortner in Kentucky so I just cut my beard it looked
like a five-year-old here's Don Fortner I always loved his preaching he was a hardcore
predestinarian Calvinist and he had all these books I used to love listening to his sermons I
would listen to hours of them every day literally until I've run out of sermons I made videos on
an old YouTube channel that I have where I actually took some of his sermons and gave him a little
music in the background you know enhanced him started going to Bible college of course I was a
Calvinist at the time look at me and my Amish I call it Amish maybe it's not Amish because I think
Amish actually cut the beard or the mustache but nonetheless I was hardcore about having a beard
and the only reason I grew my beard is for religious purposes it was not I'm going to just be a man
and wear a beard no I felt manly when I had it but I'm saying that's not why I grew it some men
might be on here who have a beard go what the hell's wrong with a beard nothing nothing's wrong
with a beard my beard was my religious symbol now I had my wisdom teeth taken out I relapsed on drugs
and if it weren't for my relapses I must say I would not have had pain and therefore would not
have growth in life and realizing man I don't have all the answers I was just like a big baby
dude they put me to sleep I just couldn't handle the dentist now that I've had all this drug experience
and done some horrible things to use I found myself in a situation where I ended up you know
I guess you say not afraid to go on the go to the dentist and have worked on
let's keep going let's keep going let's see what we got here started working for T-Mobile
I was working for T-Mobile here okay got kids turtles we moved to Raleigh Ryan had Caden
she got really sick she was in the hospital my wife was in the hospital with uh I guess she she
had to have antibiotics I can't remember exactly what happened my dad's special forces in the green
beret um somewhere around here I think I was starting to take um steroids again I think I
don't know I can't remember but I went through some phases this guy got shot okay we saved his
life literally and had the cops coming everything held held the pressure down so he clotted up and
didn't die my wife left me we were separated during this time we had a I had a really struggling
situation in this and so I always thought it was religion I always thought God had my back like it
was you know God this God that and years go by my niece's wedding years go by and as years go by I
end up starting to deconstruct and what I mean is is I stopped being so strict about what I believed
and so I went through this phase uh right here is actually part of a full preterist uh church helping
out with a speech uh buddy of mine named Michael Miano haven't spoken to him in a long time um
but uh you know and then there's Jim Fishburne and there is Joe Daniels and Michael Miano mean
we were all hanging out we had uh we had a little preterist I guess you'd say hyenas whatever you
want to call it uh that weekend now I'm getting clean again and this is the last time I got clean
oh I screwed up okay last time I got clean it wasn't too far back here this is kind of current
right here guys I I'm confident I'm full of myself and I don't have um the belief in God like I did
you know and I'm truly truly comfortable with that now that being said let's go back over here
and let's change up this lighting so you guys can see oops all right so here we are I found myself
technically realizing how many ideas there are out there about God about religion um the different
systems and I found out about astral theology mythology etc etc and when I started thinking
about celestial myths and how these are possibly celestial myths I held on to something still right
I still held on to belief in something and uh it was a good transitional phase for me to go the
mythological route going toward mythology uh rather than trying to go from a belief in the book to
like an anti belief in the book like a total absolute polar opposite it was a good transitional
phase for me because I don't think I would have been comfortable enough to going from believer to
absolute non-believer like that it allowed me to say maybe there's something more and possibly there
could be something more but I really think I was addicted to it because I was able to escape reality
in my research and my studying and the music that I would listen to of course you know a lot of
christian music has that mesmerizing type hypnosis style type rhythm with a repetitive type of
hooks and it just gets you in this in this mentality where you're kind of zoned out of reality um
and today I I actually no longer part of any of that and I at this point I'm looking for natural
causes I'm trying to explain things if we possibly can with a natural explanation rather than needing
to be supernatural or suppose anything in another realm does that make sense or another metaphysical
explanation or something to make sense of some of these things I'm trying to make sense of them
naturally that's what I'm trying to do I think we humans get purpose to things and
without us in our own frame of mind in our own minds these things may have purpose to other
things but they may not serve the same purpose we humans give them so uh I don't know today this is
where I'm at I don't know uh I'm very comfortable with not knowing if there is something called a
god or a god or something as we've been understanding god to be out there I very much doubt there is
by definition I guess you'd say I'm an atheist but I'm more of a I don't know to be fair is it
possible yeah and I had this pointed out to me recently when I was talking about do you really
think the 27 new testament books were all written by people of the same like doctrines and mind and
all that and I was talking about Bart Ehrman's book you know Forged and this guy's like Derek do you
think it's possible that um is it possible that there was an infallible book ever written in
history before and I said well I guess it's possible just as much it's just as possible though that we
live in a matrix you know like Elon Musk talks about we live in some computer so to speak and not
you know this is not real uh that's possible uh is it possible that there are metaphysical pink
elephants running around right now everywhere and we can't see them that's possible uh we can talk
about possible but what's really probable and I said give me a good example give me a good example
of something that is provable that says hey this is an infallible book this is an infallible text
or an infallible person or whatever you know show me show me an example or anything and I guess I'm
gonna remain doubting Thomas I'm gonna remain a doubting Thomas because I think that's a good way
I think the New Testament when it when it starts to praise those who do not see yet still believe
is a way of saying they're trying to get you to believe without needing to see I think and notice
Jesus didn't even mock Thomas in this text um I think it's good to doubt and to not think that
this is possibly real if it is I think that just like Jesus he'll reveal himself to you that's it
he'll reveal himself to you or God or it or whatever will reveal itself to you and make it
very clear and if not he doesn't care about you he only cared about them so there's a lot of
logical explanations that make sense to me I'm fully okay with being who I am today and uh just
wanted to roast me a little and show you guys I was a little bit uh wackadoodle you know drinking
the Kool-Aid I was really really uh religious and today I'm not I love you guys and let us know if
