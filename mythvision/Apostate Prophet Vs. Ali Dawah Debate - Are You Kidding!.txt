in a weird way I had to sort of just free myself up to believe that it was okay to be stupid or dumb
to be a moron yeah to be moronical exactly to be a moron I was observing during the live stream
on apostate prophet's channel when he was having this discussion with Ali Dawah everybody knows
you never go full retard and he made a few predictions that I saw up front which makes
me really think maybe ridvan is really a prophet
if you pay attention closely you'll see he's greater than Nostradamus when we are face to face
when we are face to face I can humiliate you in front of five million people and they will
laugh at you and you will get anxiety lol he emphatically states that he knows that some trick
some type of goofy I'm gonna try and embarrass you type of thing is gonna happen
but hey that's what these guys do right so people take them seriously I think not if you pay
attention closely during this discussion right out the gate when they actually start to talk
Ali Dawah describes exactly the reason why he is doing this curse fast if you after evidence is
brought forth you persist on disbelieving then it's very simple we are so certain and sure of our
religion Naghla subhanahu wa ta'ala says in surah al-alimran verse 61 that you bring your
children we bring our children you bring your family we bring our family and we do an open curse
pay attention closely because he is very emotional about this situation that a lot of Muslims
are being killed for hate crimes by non-Muslims people who hate Islam or followers of Islam
are out here killing them and he directly or indirectly is blaming AP for these actions
now the reason we're doing this is because from my perspective just to clarify
is because Islamophobia when somebody is an Islamophobe yeah like for example you have ISIS
ISIS when they come and speak and say certain things their full soldiers take action and kill
innocent non-Muslims on the road and the same thing happens with the Islamophobia industry when
they utter certain things and you have individuals like the one who carried out the New Zealand
Christ Church attack you have people who take matters into their own hands and see Islam and
the Muslims as their enemies and take the matters in their own hands by massacring 51 people so
therefore when somebody like April's who has done videos where his following is like this you know
general people as well but also those who have an anti-hate they have a hate towards Islam
they take the matters in their own hands my wife when she's walking down the road when her hijab
is ripped off when I am walking down the road with a beard or a phone and somebody tries to
run me over and I'm not saying this happened to me I'm saying these things that follow
this is a person who is outright directly or indirectly calling for the dehumanization of
Muslims especially somebody like April's who has done a video mocking the death of pilgrims
pilgrims who have no weapons in the trait of Hodebiah when they were going to Mecca
they had no arms innocent individuals who are going to do pilgrimage and this individual here
April's mocks the death of these individuals you have dehumanized Muslims to a certain level
where individuals who watch your video I believe the individual who carried out the Christchurch
attack if he was to watch your video would he say hmm I changed my mind about Muslims or hmm
I think I should carry extra bullets that is the reason why I'm doing the open curse because you
are an individual who I believe indirectly have caused the life of innocent Muslims I'm not saying
directly you do not go and say go out and kill Muslims so that is the reason why we're doing
the curse just to clarify he's clearly indicating that if his wife was walking down the road and
her job gets ripped off or if a hate crime happens he's constantly blaming AP for this particular
thing Alidawa we only have one rule when you enter into these kind of debates discussions everybody
knows you never go full retard as the show goes on I was observing the live stream and here's AP
talking with this Alidawa and Alidawa gets really emotional in suggesting let me tell you why we're
doing this curse fast he is serious he is adamant in fact his entire motives appear to emotionally
show up when he says you indirectly or directly are guilty of the blood of innocent Muslims that
are being attacked by anti-Muslim bigots that are out there in the world trying to kill Muslims
now the interesting thing is when Alidawa said this even my bullet boiled and I thought to
myself this is actually bad stuff that's happening in the world but I've watched AP for a long time
I've never never have I ever seen him try to promote that to try and act like people need to hurt
Muslims in fact the opposite has been the case but I can't expect someone like Alidawa to actually
pay attention to AP's material because he's on the other side and usually I'm sure whatever AP
says offends him and his god his religion etc about in my videos are you aware that I posted many
videos including one that is dedicated in which I explain that I do not hate Muslims that I find
it wrong to hate Muslims and that I condemn violence and discrimination against people are you aware
of that so you have blood on your hands indirectly or directly categorically you have not ever said
in any video that you should go out and hunt or kill Muslims I said you did not ever say that
okay sure but he specifically says this is the reason why I'm doing this he takes this whole
curse fest thing quite seriously is he a liar is he purposely deceiving everyone for what his
motives are here and I want you to pay attention to something of Alidawa's body language if you
watch this live stream he uncontrollably keeps eating food
now you know I've gone to the dentist to have my wisdom teeth pulled out a long time ago and
so afraid I munched on food just because my nerves were eating me up at the time I was afraid of the
dentist not going to lie but there was a time it you know in the future where I wasn't so afraid
it was kind of going through the fear that helped me he keeps eating uncontrollably and it's apparent
that he is nervous maybe he's met the prophet himself and realized ooh I need to watch how I
act in front of the prophet but seriously there's a psychological thing behind trying to distract
oneself so that it appears you're not nervous and in doing so you look nervous lots of police
officers and such have done the same thing for murders where people are suspects in a murder
case they come in to be questioned and they can't control the way they move or act and that seems
to be Alidawa AP explicitly claims and says I'm against violence I've never ever wanted violence
for Muslims or non-Muslims nobody did you or did you not make a video in which no I'm going to give
you a last chance did you or did you not make a video in which you said that people believe Islam
should be executed this we're gonna come to look I'm telling you you know what I would come to that
what I'm saying now is we have to do the mubahela I have very categorically and clearly said that
Islam has a law a legislation that applies capital punishment for people like you but guess what I
got prison for you okay so prison for you're gonna love so we're gonna come to that okay but you
can't say the same about Alidawa I know that from the past watching some of his content as well
you know I ventured into Islam recently just to study it these guys are horrible representatives
when it comes to actually studying Islam these guys I mean you Alidawa and at the end of the day
let's be honest you want apostates to be killed especially at least AP you've said so yourself
in fact you have said I am proud of that we're gonna come to that let me quickly respond to your
preaching and I am proud of that I didn't talk as long as I am proud of that okay let me quickly
respond to your preaching so so you preached lengthily and said that people like me because we
talk about Islam are somehow to be blamed for indirect or direct violence against against
most steps but as it stands when AP's responding just saying yeah you did say that you were nodding
your head no like and then you finally oh yeah because you're not listening you don't really care
to listen what other people have to say you're only there to speak I know a lot of people like that
cognitive dissonance works in wonderful ways it's quite interesting to watch it happen in live
person on the screen while I'm watching AP here you are giving me a perfect definition of such
matter I explicitly always oppose hating and harm and violence and I have never advocated for it on
the other hand Alidawa has never ever made such a categorical you know opposition or condemnation
of violence against people for their beliefs and ideas and all that on top of that he did make a
video in which he explicitly said that people like me who leave their religion should be executed
and that he's proud of that but I am the one who is indirectly responsible for taking people's lives
okay can I speak you even have a video of you saying people like AP should be killed I don't
understand the logic you don't want people to kill Muslims right I don't either but you really
are proud of the fact that ex-Muslims like AP should be put to death do you know who else is proud
of killing people the honorary killings that take place at the hand of Muslims because of their
cultural backgrounds that are in the UK the people over there are killing their own daughters
in honorary killings and they are proud of that I wonder if you're proud of that as well
that's a really horrible system I don't get the logic I don't think you get the logic I think it
really doesn't make sense unless you are okay with people just killing people because as far as I'm
concerned things will never change when people think the way that you think can I speak go ahead
you're gonna make me cry there I'll be honest I watched Titanic but it wasn't that emotional
as what you just said there I'm gonna start crying can you pass me a tissue please I need a
tissue right now you get that so let's just get this right guys yeah dramatic please do you see
me crying do you see me do you see me sad no anyways anyways anyways then you try to make kind
of a funny and even AP tries to make light of it because he's trying to carry on the conversation
but after you've technically made a death threat to AP you turn around and say get me a tissue
mockingly say dry up my my empty tears I have no tears I have nothing to cry for I don't care for
you I hate you you actually wish he was dead and that you're getting tears for your dry face you
know that is a sign that everything you say cannot be taken serious in fact I've seen the
people the Muslims who look at you in disgrace and say that you are nothing you are nothing
but a bad example for all of Islam I hope more Muslims see you and say I will never I will never
be like him we need to run in the opposite direction of people like you and those Muslims I seriously
commend you and I hope that more Muslims will see examples of him Muhammad he job when he acts like
a nutcase and all of the above and they run from them and stop following these ridiculous people
one second okay you got it's 831 um you can go and you have your time
or do you want me to go ahead right now with the with the yes please if you can please it'll be a
pleasure sure um since it has not been exactly clarified how it should be done I will uh I would
like to ask uh I'll laugh the all my supposedly Almighty God for um a curse that will be very
specifically I don't think it's too much to ask he's almighty he can do whatever he wants uh let's
do this so dear Allah who is the Arabian god of the can you do this can you do this no I I I can
do this okay how about that dear like this okay this is how I pray to Allah you can pray however
however you want anyways it doesn't matter like this yeah it doesn't wow you're the ex-Muslim and he
prayed like this no I pray like this Allah Arabian god of the Kaaba who took over the place of the
polytheists and who sent his prophet Mopus dear Allah I ask you if you are real and if Islam is true
and if I am lying about Islam if I am lying about Islam if I am wrong deliberately then please
right now take my life within the next 10 seconds within within the next 10 seconds okay now that's
good now guys did I stop you and did I dive but in okay it's way for 10 seconds 10 seconds are over
fine see no no I think there were two more seconds there one second why does Allah not what guys check
this out okay I'm pretty sure Allah will be okay with this he doesn't have to he doesn't have to
wait for us to finish right okay okay um everybody you're seeing this right you see the result I'm
not dead I'm alive I won't have time to go through every example here on this episode but I do want
to mention one highlight I'm reminded of a bible story in the bible you have Elijah the prophet who
comes to face all of the bell prophets all the bell priests and they come into the field there's 450
bell priests and there's one Elijah and they call upon their god that day and Elijah is saying where's
your god did he go to the bathroom did he fall asleep what did he go on a vacation is your god
not gonna show up because they they prayed to have him come down and light this altar on fire and of
course it doesn't happen then Elijah calls down fire from heaven god show him you're the one true
god etc etc and it happens but you know it is interesting even in the biblical account that
both of the participants are believers in some type of deity do you think it's kind of odd that it
doesn't work on atheists I think it's kind of weird because when you don't believe in no ghost
kind of strange how ghosts doesn't affect you that's been happening that's been my case as well
I think the way I perceive the world also creates the reality in which I'm living and the fact that
you came in seriously to have this cursed fast then to turn around and make it a joke even though
you're not you technically you're making a joke about the fact that Muslims are being killed
by anti Muslims okay people who hate Muslims are killing Muslims and you made a joke of this
whole thing because you said the whole reason you're doing this is because Muslims are being killed
by people who hate Islam and hate Muslims well that's strange because all of this is a joke to you
every single bit of this is a joke I would say grow up become a man gird up thy loins like a man
as the bible said to Job when God spoke to him okay wake up cut the crap grow up man this isn't
funny you're talking about people's lives and you're making it a joke and I'm going to be here
mocking and things like that it is interesting that ap himself prayed asking Allah to come and kill
him he admits come kill me prove that you're true kill me nothing happens but then again I expected
that because me nor him believe in your god or think he exists and at the end of the day he may
not even care about silly matters if he did exist on this you're probably not as true follower in
fact he probably sees you as someone who's really an apostate now guys this is how he fell in my trap
I got a surprise for you what is I know do you know that you know everything about
Islam do you not know that is actually done this you're not to claim that you was a practicing
muslim yes I do let's give that another tick we've got two ticks so far not bad okay do you
not claim you know more than 90 percent of the muslims yeah I'm not sure about 90 it might be 95
but sure around those make it 99 yeah no how about that I wouldn't say 99 no but 95 95 is okay
I'm happy no let's say 90 I'll be okay 90 the higher it goes better for me so you said you are more
you know more about Islam than 95 percent of muslims yeah yeah okay yeah maybe sure 95 okay no
let's give that another check I don't know I have to think about this but sure yeah 99
okay no now three ticks are better than zero ticks now the whole point was to trap ap to do the
mubahala that's so weird I don't know what that is I've never heard of such a thing and I bet you
90 to 95 percent of muslims don't even really know what this is some of the scholars might
some of the more devout followers but most muslims don't even know what they're reading I've had
plenty of people tell me that they recite or try to memorize and they don't even know what they're
reading so to know what mubahala is for the average muslim no I guess that validates ap's
understanding that he probably knows more than 90 to 95 percent of muslims that mubahala cannot be
done with an atheist oh really yes because why just keep in mind mubahala doesn't work
not only for muslims but I challenge Ali Dawah to look like a fool and do this with David Wood
David Wood believes in Jesus he's a Christian which the original mubahala with the prophet Muhammad
right did this with a Christian why don't you do this with uh David Wood let's see how things pan
out with you let's see if anything you say actually happens it's a battle of the gods and if it doesn't
happen what will you say about your god there's so much more I didn't cover in this episode it's
really embarrassing waste man waste man when did we agree to debate your topic why do you not want
to debate Islam you know we call you a little ute I think they don't want to talk about these things
because they are embarrassed about their religion which is why this guy has to sit here and listen
insults and discuss about theology when he doesn't even understand it I mean have you listened to
this guy's contingency argument it is the dumbest thing that I've ever heard he doesn't know what
he's talking about at least more people will realize how ridiculous these guys are they're
serious you don't know everybody knows you never go full retard
you
you
