we are myth vision welcome back ladies and gentlemen thank you for your
patience your host Eric Lambert and I want to invite someone special here
they have a YouTube channel he's a YouTube creator he plays video games like
me as well by the way that's not predominantly what he does here on this
channel but you can check him out there and we were just having a good
conversation about that Tom jump is that your real name yeah it's my real name
that's kind of the basis of my YouTube name T jump just the first letter my
first name on my last name that wasn't the greatest name to have in grade school
though I can imagine man yeah you've got a great YouTube channel you talk about
some of the interesting things that many people ask those questions what are
some of the subjects you talk about on your channel usually epistemology
philosophy and morality because the entire basis of my channel is I wrote an
epistemology and model of morality and the point of inviting on professors and
philosophers and apologetics to demonstrate how effective my models
can be even at the highest academic levels that was kind of the starting
foundation of my channel interesting man interesting so go over there make
sure you check it out T jump it's in the description of my video here and make
sure you subscribe show him positivity please YouTube world don't be pessimistic
about everything you know go show him some love and if you have questions
challenge him he loves a challenge he loves these ideas so stimulate the
thought go in there and join his YouTube channel as well we're gonna delve into a
few things I guess more personal and then we'll get into some broad topics Tom if
you don't mind me starting off with a question where you once a believer and
did you have a quest escaping out of that system what what's your journey yeah
so I was brought up Christian for most of my life my parents are both Christian
my mom was especially religious like reads the Bible every day go to church
all that kind of stuff and I was brought up in that culture went to Catholic
schools from K through high school K through 12 and was exposed to it pretty
religiously but after years and years of major depression because I was
diagnosed with that since I was a kid and and praying every day for that
personal being who you expect to be there to come up come be a part of your
life and help you out when you're in real need not hearing anything in return
eventually led me away from believing there was such a thing if you expect a
personal relationship with someone and they just ignore you eventually you
stop caring about that person that's kind of how I felt about God for a while
where just him not responding when I expected them to respond baby lack lack
of feeling of that emotional personal relationship that I was expecting as a
Christian and eventually it just kind of fizzled out to the point where I just
stopped believing the God even existed in the first place and became an atheist
sometime in late high schools junior senior year maybe the laughter that but
there's always like a little bit where I would be tempted to pray for something
when I wanted something to change or wasn't going through a hard time but
eventually it just became longer and longer stretches where I just didn't
have that feeling at all until the point where I just stopped believing entirely
and now you have a channel dedicated to discussing these type of things and
did you have a deconstructing like period and it slowly happened or was it a
aha moment?
Well my philosophy came years after I became an atheist so the reason I
stopped believing was just that personal emotional thing of not having any prayers
answered no personal relationship but I didn't know anything about the
philosophy of the arguments at that point a few years after I became or just
stopped believing I started watching debates by like Christopher Hitchens
Richard Dawkins Sam Harris those kinds of guys I got really interested in the
philosophy side of things I started to research it and I thought their arguments
those of the four horsemen were really great arguments when I started off and
then as I researched more in the philosophy like oh these are actually
really terrible arguments we should probably go a little bit deeper and try
and find the more interesting philosophy side and so that's how I got into the
philosophy of it and I started to have invite on professors local professors
from colleges that go to coffee shops and have conversations with me and those
went really well and I started to upload on the YouTube and that's how my YouTube
channel got started so that's how I transitioned from just not believing into
the philosophy of the arguments behind why we shouldn't believe in the first place
interesting interesting yeah I've always wondered that I enjoy watching videos where
even a scientist tries to take an approach and understand the human mind
why we're superstitious to begin with you know some of those interesting scientific
approaches make me wonder you know why do I have a curiosity about me when I
don't understand things I try to fill the void and I think he explained it one
time and it was just very basic he gave many analogies many examples but
and I can't remember who this guy was I'd have to find a link and put it in the
description if I can find it if not you guys might know who I'm talking about but
kind of like the eye where there's that blind spot and like in boxing they say the
best thing you can do is straight jab because there's a blind spot in the eye
straight on and any other like roundhouse or something or whatever you're going to
see a hook coming well the brain works similar there's a blind spot in the brain
we try to fill these these unknowable things kind of like deja vu what's deja vu oh I know
what deja vu is god knew what my life was going to be and revealed a glimpse of it and let me
know that he knew I mean that's so subjective to say that is it wrong I mean now you got to
talk about probability now you got to talk about what ifs none of that's provable that's
what your experience says okay that's how you feel about it okay but can you prove what you're
saying and I think you delve a lot into that and you're very respectful in the process which is a
good thing too often anti-theist or throwing dung at christians and they're just making christians
claw deeper into their emotional status with their faith and not like having a good dialogue and I
think pine creek does that too he might be a little humorous but I think he does that he
does pretty good about that so yeah one of the more interesting things is that if you are positive
and have more of a not just demeaning outlook on christians you can get a lot of support from both
sides and get christians then to watch your videos like I invite a lot of professors and
philosophers theists and as long as I'm not like demeaning to them I can get a lot of support
both financially and donations and subscribers from christian the christian side of things
because they really both sides really appreciate when you have an honest open dialogue even with
someone like Kit Hovind who is notorious for being not as polite as everyone else and people like
Aarang Ra who is definitely more of a firebrand atheist those people can get a lot of support from
their side but you don't usually get a good conversation and interaction between the two
sides which is I think a really important thing that is missing in the community and I like it
I really enjoy that certain kinds of people like me and the street epistemologists especially
Anthony Magnosko read nice wonder those kinds of guys are more into the polite open discussion
kind of a format which shows a deeper side of the conversation that we don't usually get to see
can we delve into some of that like maybe discuss some I guess conversations you've had recently
good conversations with theist and have you had any theist go you know what that makes a lot of
sense have you had that happen yet yeah it had that happen a whole bunch of times actually one of
the more interesting ones the ones with Chris Gadson Dr. Chris Gadson I think he's got a PhD
in philosophy where he was really considering the arguments especially the argument from evil and
looking into it saying oh I don't I don't really I have to take more time to think about that because
I'm not really sure how to respond at this point another one would be Rick Mattson where I did the
same thing with my argument for the problem of evil the problem of involuntary suffering is what I
call it and he said oh I really have to think about that I'm not sure how to respond to that because
I've never really heard it before and so I get that quite often in my conversations even at
professor level where they're like oh that's interesting not even I have to take some more
time to think about that that's always a good sign when they say that I mean and that's a nice way
of saying I don't want to run into this dead end here because uh yeah you seem like you you've got
your head wrapped around this so talk about some of these arguments if you will if you can bring
up some points on what what you discovered after becoming an atheist and your prayers not being
answered what was it that you started to research what was it that made you start to see a solid
position yeah so I was looking into just basic epistemology how do we know anything and I liked
I fell upon uh Rene Descartes I think therefore I am the cogito ergo sum and that was what I
discovered to be the most solid foundation for knowledge the first and only thing we can truly
know with absolute certainty is that we exist and then from that where do we go and I came
up with this there's some difference between my imagination and my experience if I like imagine
a unicorn I don't see a unicorn so there's some difference between the stuff going on in our head
and the stuff we see in the world so our uh conceptual interpretation versus our empirical
sense experience interpretation and so we need some way to distinguish between these two categories
is any one thing of the conceptual kind or the empirical kind because there's lots of things we
can see empirically that are also just a part of our mind with illusions delusions hallucinations all
those kinds of things and so for anything we see we have to create some kind of a methodology to
differentiate between is this thing that we think exists part of the world or is it just a part of
our imagination and the best way to do that is just science novel testable predictions you can
explain anything anything from the past or the present with just infinitely many ways to explain
it so like if you see a cup fall over what could have caused that to happen maybe it was the wind
maybe it was a squirrel or a bird psychic magic powers asteroid invisible aliens you can just
explain how it not how it was knocked over in any any of infinitely many ways but the best explanation
is the one that can say it was done by this and then if it was done by this I can predict here's
something we don't know yet and if we look we're going to discover this so if you can predict
future predictions that we don't know about yet and get them right consistently that explanation
is better than all the others so that's how science works is that we look at the data we try to make
predictions and say well if what my theory my conceptual theory in my head is correct it's an
accurate description of what's going on in the world well then I can probably make predictions
about what's going to happen next in the world and if I can get those right well then it's a pretty
good evidence that this theory I have isn't just something in my head it's describing something
that's actually in the world and so then we have a methodology we can use to differentiate
the conceptual stuff in our head that's just made up and the empirical stuff and what's in
reality and what's we have a reason to believe is there and that's kind of the foundation of all
knowledge right with start with this I think before I am there's some difference between
my imagination and my experience and then there's a third category which is what is the fundamental
nature of everything and essentially we don't know science does not have a way to apprehend that yet
so that we just we should just leave that one off the table for now that's interesting yeah I always
ask like even going back a fundamental question how the hell did we even come to be like what you
know and these are things that like you said we don't have enough to give you actual evidence but
does that mean we need to throw in something that we don't have the evidence for to make sense of it
let me ask you this a buddy of mine recently has been posting a lot of videos on Facebook
and I can't remember the guy's name but the whole thing is non-duality have you done a lot of
research on non-duality well there's a couple of things that can mean like non-duality in physics
is definitely maybe a thing and non-duality in consciousness not so much so like that's yeah
dualism where the position that there's the physical world and the mental world and there's
separate things that both exist that isn't supported most of the academic field doesn't
really take it seriously it's a very minority position in philosophy because it doesn't really
add anything to say that consciousness is its own kind of a thing separate from the physical
world we can always anything that can be explained by this separate conscious thing can just be
explained by unknown physical things so why add a new category we don't need it any unknown could
be explained by this supernatural but it could also just be explained by an unknown natural
and so if you actually wanted to say that there was this supernatural um consciousness realm out
there you'd have to make new testable predictions to differentiate it from again just being an
imaginary thing like how do you tell the difference between this being an imaginary or a real part of
the world you've got to make future testable predictions and dualism and idealism neither of
them can do that they're just uh explaining all the old stuff in different ways which doesn't
accomplish anything because again that provides no way to differentiate is this an imaginary thing
or if it's a real thing so I'll I'll pose one of the points he made and I don't know you've probably
heard this before but deep sleep do you remember deep sleep they always ask me this right and I'm
like well I I know I dream pretty hard and he's like no no no deep sleep you don't remember anything
like he kind of pushed me into that corner of like no I I guess I don't remember anything I said
you know I wake up after deep sleep I had a good rest he's like that's pure consciousness now he
started getting into this right he sends me this video love the guy to death I mean he's a great
guy you know and there's so many people out there that are like this so don't take offense if you're
watching this but I'm I'm listening to this guy and I swear to everything the his the language
the guy's using is so vague and it's so like it's non-concrete to the point where I'm like
what is he trying to say I just don't understand this vague non-concrete language this guy's
using to try and prove a point and the point I guess is um this guy kept making it seem like
consciousness that we had pure everything's consciousness okay and that we I guess you'd
say is like where does consciousness come from and I'm like doesn't it come from the brain or
like it develops with us as we would call what consciousness is is our awareness and so forth
and I said well why don't we remember consciousness when we were born or like when we're like
within our first year isn't the brain developing and now it's creating a memory and all this stuff
that all seems natural to me and he didn't really have much he's a deep sleep back to deep sleep
and I'm like I don't I don't know what what are your thoughts have you heard these type of things
before I've never heard that one like deep sleep just the fact that we can't remember things when
we're not conscious uh I don't know why that would be indicative of uh our brains being fundamental
of C or our mind some kind of non-physical consciousness I think it's actually the evidence
of the opposite like we can we have the way that our brains interact with the world of
physical bodies so I can interact with my hand and make it move but I can't like make
the TV remote float into my hand like I can't use the force to lift it up so it doesn't seem
like my brain can actually affect the world outside of my head but the other the opposite
is true so like if I shock myself with an electrode I can make myself see things that aren't there
or feel things or taste things or move my hand without my control so it seems like the physical
world has control over our brains but our brains our minds don't seem to have much control over
the physical world so it seems like we have pretty good reason to believe that um our minds
are caused or controlled by the physical world and not the other way around so it seems like we can
rule out idealism and dualism for the most part interesting yeah I this guy's uh throwing out new
ideas he just jumped on this new theory and he's been watching these videos I can't remember the
guy's name either uh I was watching one of them and I was kind of like this sounds very religious
it just sounds very like that's how you sound it so let's let's jump subjects Tom if you don't mind
uh Christianity okay like most of my friends and family are Christians um it's it's been tough
trying to even convey where I'm heading in my own life my personal journey on my research and how I've
deconstructed and um my mama always comes up to me and I say mama because I'm a mama's boy
and she's just always been mom and she's like remember now Jesus is Lord and remember now and
I'm like I remember mom like you know like I'm not gonna disrespect mom here but um when I started
researching it what I started to do I guess in my personal journey wasn't necessarily the prayer
thing because uh uh that wasn't something I guess when I prayed it usually was something I was already
driven to get or do so then when it would happen I guess I could easily explain well I was motivated
to do that thing like help me get clean off drugs well I could say that something in my mind snapped
and a switch went off and I drove myself to participate in a group of people that helped me
rewire my brain and that's what I really named my recovery channel rewired addiction um but in terms
of the text because I was a man of the book I was Protestant it was Sola Scriptura it was I was a real
hardcore reformer and I started deconstructing and started looking at eschatology eschatology was
the key component that started making me realize Jesus promised that generation all these things
would be fulfilled and of course Christians are like these things not not the final not not this
and I started getting really really into it to a point where I said the textual evidence seems to
suggest the parasy was supposed to happen in the first century you know James Stewart Russell wrote
a book in the 1900s on preterism and so I was a preterist for a believing preterist then I started
to see things and I was like hold on this seems like allegory there's too many copies of things
that are going on it just seems like Moses and Joshua Elijah and Elisha and John the Baptist
and Jesus or Jesus in the church there's this like pattern going on and it doesn't seem natural
it seemed like it was put there and that's when I guess that's when all hell broke loose for me I
started to go whoa hold on people are missing something and I saw myth I started researching
myth and I started researching celestial myths and things that how a lot of things are maybe
touching on astrological things that aren't to be understood literally when I did that I started
going well is Jesus supposed to be literally understood as resurrected from the dead and
so myth vision is born and this is where my youtube channel comes on the scene there's
so many ideas of did this guy even exist he may have if he did who was he what did he do
what are your thoughts on all of that I mean you can ramble man I took over some time so
yeah so the historicity of the bible is a really interesting topic because language is just a field
linguistics can be interpreted in essentially infinitely many ways to quote Carl Popper he
said it's impossible to phrase anything so that it can't be misunderstood so anything you phrase
because of the natural ambiguity of language can be interpreted in infinitely many ways and so
which is why you have this gigantic 30 000 different denominations of christianity because
the LA's interpret certain scriptures to mean one thing or the other thing and I think it's really
important for some reason and you can just interpret them in so many ways we don't really know
which way is right or which way is the the correct way to get you into heaven this this quote is
required for you to interpret it in this way and there's just so many variations there's no real
way to be sure and that field of uh hysteria to discover like what is the most reasonable
interpretation is this a reliable field how does how does this correspond to the archaeology
all of those questions are so detailed and so hard to really grasp if you don't have an
education in the background um it's it's difficult to have conversations without uh
with theists because they just take their interpretation and use that as gospel it's
essentially just a reflection of their own personal beliefs and what they identify with
and telling them that they're wrong well it's it's hard to convince them unless they already have
the background knowledge to take the historiographer methodology seriously if they don't do that
then you're not going to be able to present evidence to them to change their mind about
the interpretation because they don't acquire information in that way and so I usually don't
go the historiography route because it's more about language and reaffirming your own personal
belief system than anything and trying to change someone's mind on that is really really hard even
if you're talking with like the professional historiographers like uh Bart Ehrman and Mike
Lacona and Gary Hattermass and uh all the guys from the both sides with listening to them people
don't usually change their position on the topics because they don't understand them like I have no
idea what he said but he sounded smart and he agreed to my position therefore that's my opposition
so I think the historiography is a really interesting field but it's hard to use that to
compel people to change their position one way or the other so that's why I usually go more towards
the philophilosity route because it's something people can grasp like the universe began to exist
the universe has a cause most people can get that that's something that they can they can
understand and try to work their head around as opposed to something like well what year was
uh marked in John Luke written and what were the authors were they actually named that who
like who what is the Q source like where where where is this where does this go in their heads
like how do they process this information to come to the conclusion that their interpretation is
right or wrong like it's it's it's so hard to explain that by looking at the history historiography
of the bible that I usually go with the philosophy it's easier to understand wow I mean that makes a
lot of sense I totally get it I guess because I'm a fan of the topic I mean it had its claws on me
so much it still does but in a different way you know I enjoy the stimulating thought like I'm I'm
torn between minimal historicity and and mythicism um and I just I love the topic I love the ideas
I get where you're coming from and I'm gonna be listening to you more I probably have to have
you come on more when I when I educate myself more on the topic that you're researching because
I am open minded to these things I'm open minded to whatever direction these things can go now I
wanted to ask you something you brought something up uh and we've heard you know theists such as like
William Lane Craig you know the Kalam cosmological argument uh well I wanted your thoughts do you
think the universe could be eternal oh it depends on what you mean so I think there must be a
necessary something but what that necessary something means is completely ambiguous it could
be a past eternal universe it could be a cyclical universe some multiverse there could be a natural
thing that came before space and time and space and time emerged from some natural thing there's
some theories in physics that argue for that called emergent space time by Sean Carroll and Neymar
Connie Hamad could be a god could be polytheism with lots of gods or trans theism where there's
gods and there's something above gods there could be any number of things about what the
fundamental nature of reality actually is we have no idea I think that the most reasonable conclusion
if you want to try and say or try to label whatever that is it's to say it's probably just
going to be a natural something we just haven't discovered yet because everything you see around
us is natural why would we say this is a new category of thing for no reason you just you
only have natural things as far as you can tell we just extend the natural to the fundamental
nature of reality and say it's probably going to be natural so I lean towards that kind of
ideology where it's going to be something natural maybe a past eternal universe or a
cyclical universe or emergent space time but I tend to think it's probably not going to be
conscious because the only examples of consciousness we have are from brains if it doesn't have a
brain we have no example of consciousness so I think we can rule out the consciousness approach
and say it's probably just going to be a natural something with a law or a universe of something
so I'm going to get weird because you make me think about things in a way that I haven't
really thought of in a minute life like what are your thoughts on why life even exists I mean
isn't it a weird thing that that you know an asteroid would hit a planet suppose the theory of
us coming from the components the elements from an asteroid and here we are made mostly of carbon
and water and boom here's humans with conscious states or at least self-thinking brains and
machines inside of ourselves that are keeping us going what are your thoughts on all that and I know
this is way beyond the scope of us being able to prove like why this thing is but do you have a
personal opinion at this point oh yeah so I think that life because right now we're isn't the
concrete definition of what life is and in biology we have no idea what the cutoff point is between
non-living and living we look there's a really great TED talk where a guy shows a certain
combination of chemicals can seem like it's alive like it can act like a virus or a biological
system where it seeks food and energy and it moves around the system to try and find the food
and all it is is just a few kind of chemicals that have been put together and at what point do we
say its capabilities call qualify it to be a call of life we have no idea it's a kind of an arbitrary
distinction right now because we don't know the process by which life formed and so we don't really
know should we call certain kinds of crystals life because they can form and mutate and gain
information lose information and react in certain ways we really have no idea so in the case that
we see it as strange the reason we see it as strange is because we really don't know what
life is we give it this classification of its own kind of thing but we really don't have a way to
distinguish life from non-life because when we get to the fundamental level of what makes
something life it's just molecules and motion just like matter is so I don't think life is
particularly strange anymore than anything else it's just strange because we haven't we don't
don't know enough about it yet so we used to think lightning was strange it must be something
supernatural because of look at how strange it is yeah but really it was just we just didn't
know anything about it same with volcanoes and asteroids we used to attribute they'll just say
look how strange these are how do you explain those but really it was just something we just
couldn't explain and we just labeled it as being the super strange thing that's totally
inexplicable we really will just discover it later and then it'll just be oh that's so simple to
understand now hmm that's interesting I like that I really I really like that because that's how we
advance and and I think our science that's gonna be better for humanity period once we get to that
level I feel like life will be extended disease I mean you name it these things can be handled
but that's a that's pretty interesting and I thought of these things but the way you hit
that was really well like you're really well articulate do you debate um a lot I've heard
you debate before um like our favorite uh uh not flat earth I almost called him no disrespect but
young earth creationist that you mentioned earlier who loves to uh throw stones at atheist uh what's
his name again kept holding yes did you have fun with that debate the uh that last time you
guys were talking yeah I've actually debated him three times um and I think the third one I was the
most abrupt with him where I was just saying nope that's wrong that's kind of dumb the first two was
really more of a conversation style which was a lot of fun but yeah I do debates pretty often I do
I try to schedule one a week usually um and then I usually get invited to interviews and things
two or three times a week so I usually do about three or four videos a week on a good month um
but yeah I debated I've actually debated a few atheists too I debated um
Bob Price and I argue that Jesus did exist and he's he argues from the myth that this position
that Jesus didn't exist and uh yeah so I do debates on all kinds of topics usually physics,
cosmology, philosophy, morality, biology, Dr. Fuzerana on uh is there information,
intelligent design in living organisms that kind of thing so yeah I spread it out on as many fields
as I can and do stuff on modern day debates James has me on every once in a while so yeah I do I
debate as much as possible. That's awesome yeah so you debated Dr. Bob I saw that you had a show
with him and I started watching I don't think I watched enough of it to really get where you're
coming from do you take and I know this is complicated I just want to make like a general
base statement are you when you come to historicity of Jesus and I need to watch your debate which
means if you're watching this go to Tom's page T jump YouTube and make sure you watch it too and
go comment tell him your thoughts if you disagree with him disagree with him right he wants to
stimulate talk what do you do coming at that question I'm just gonna ask that instead of
getting deeper into it what makes you suppose you know what is it more likely because we can look at
other examples of mythologized people is that the weight of it that you say hey the odds of him not
existing based on all these things that is where I'm going off of probabilistic
you know situation here it looks like he probably did exist is that the angle or
sort of so I take the approach that uh historiography as a field has a much lower bar
for truth and like scientific fields you can't make test of predictions about somebody existing
unless you're like Caesar and Caesar claimed to have built this thing and we can archaeologically
dig it and find it oh yes this was here so yes he clearly existed but most people in history
have very very little evidence of them existing at all so most people who we think existed like
Socrates we have no accounts of him actually writing anything we're saying anything is a
direct account it's always Plato who's written stuff about Socrates or stories that Socrates
supposedly had with other people but he can be totally made up by Plato we have no idea
we just grant that he probably existed because the bar for what we consider reliable history is
pretty low though as a field it's not it doesn't take the same level of evidence as a scientific
physics or something and so most people in history that we accept existed essentially have no evidence
we have no direct or even secondary accounts of them existing they're just like I mentioned as a
third party of the secondary source and we say okay that person probably existed because it's like
if I told you I saw a dog yesterday you'd be reasonable to believe me because there's we have
lots of evidence of dogs and lots of empirical evidence of dogs like their taxonomy phylogeny
genetic makeup chemical composition we have lots of empirical evidence and so my testimony that I
saw a dog and it's reasonable because it's backed up by that empirical evidence the same thing applies
to like there is this person who existed at Timex no it's no different from saying I saw a dog it's
reasonable to believe because we have lots of evidence of people and so those simple claims like
I saw a dog or I saw a person named Jesus those are reasonable to believe just based off of someone
say so for the same reason because people have a huge amount of empirical evidence just like
dogs do but what's not reasonable to believe is when someone says I saw a unicorn like if I
told you that you would not be reasonable to believe me because it doesn't have that empirical
basis we don't have any bones of unicorns or chemical composition or genetic makeup of any of that
so it's reasonable to believe historical claims if they have an empirical basis so if I said
person X exists and person X has this name perfectly reasonable to believe just based off of
testimony but if I say they did a miracle like then it becomes unreasonable to believe the miracle
but it's still reasonable to believe the person existed so like I said I met a guy named Bob yesterday
and he can he can raise people from the dead and you'd be reasonable to believe I met a guy named
Bob but you it wouldn't be reasonable to believe that he can raise people from the dead the same
thing applies to Jesus like there are lots of people who claims to have seen Jesus in like Joseph
has tested us those kinds of things and they mention lots of people so it's reasonable to believe
the person named Jesus existed right but it's not reasonable to extend that to the miracles so I'd
say it's more reasonable to believe Jesus existed as a human for the same reason it's reasonable
to believe somebody if they said they had saw a dog it's just a claim of some a pretty simple claim
it's not really something we should dismiss just because there's lots of similarities to other
stories that may have been added on later right well let me ask you this probing a little deeper
on that point that you made it which is a good point it is reasonable um if if we do delve to try
and see all right because it it is reasonable to see that there is a person named Jesus my question
is what can we know for sure about him so that we can say hey this guy now I get it we're throwing
it up in the air you know at this point but that's what gets me interested if we're approaching it
at that angle and it makes sense it's it's a good point you're making what if it was written
after okay this war and they did bring up a propaganda there's some type of propaganda
behind this text that is creating this character and giving reason or weight as to why the temple
destroyed etc so I guess it could it be and I guess what I'm asking Tom I know you can you
can track where I'm going with this could it be that this guy was created so to speak um giving
way or reason for why this all happened the temple's destruction the destruction of the
nation of Israel practically everything and that I mean that plays the role through the
gospels but could it be that Paul's Jesus was angelic could it be you know there's so many
angles to come at this do you think there's any validity in approaching that kind of subject
that way or yeah completely ambiguous it's definitely possible but I think that if we
look at like characters like even like Hercules or the Greek myths like is it more reasonable
that this person was fabricated for nothing or is it based off of a real human who did something
that was just embellished over and over and over again like in that game telephone where
it just gets more and more grandiose and to the point where it's just like a mythical god figure
so I think it's more reasonable thing Jesus was a person and then that story was embellished to
make him a god rather than him just being fabricated from nothing okay and that uh that idea is
euhemorrhization I believe um euhemorrh came up with the idea that Hercules might have been an
ancient bodybuilder as Dr. Bob always likes to joke or whatever you know he always was like
uh Hercules was an ancient bodybuilder and they made him into a god and um and see there's so
many things that come to my mind on people that I invite on the show that make me think
more than that just that approach you know I get where you're coming from and I wanted to invite
um the other gentleman that's joined uh on Pine Creek uh he used to be a mythicist and he's now
a historicist uh we were talking about him prior to this recording uh Cam or Camille Cam
yeah he was a mythicist and is now a historicist I actually tried to invite Bart Ehrman as well
Dr. Ehrman to come on which he's probably not going to because he's so busy and I don't know if
you'd see it even beneficial I'd have to spend money probably to get him on but I wanted to
like test some thoughts and throw things out at him to get his opinion on this you know um
I I really enjoy the conversation because I can at one point say there's probably a guy
there's there's gotta be probably a guy my thing is if he was really a guy was he really crucified
if he was really crucified by the Romans for what purpose the Jews should have stoned him if he
claimed to be divine that's according to the law so it would be unreasonable to crucify him on
on the day that he's crucified and hold a trial the night before the eva and and have Rome do it
was he a rebel leader at that point makes me wonder if he was militant anyway did he have ties in
with Dead Sea Scrolls is Robert Eisenman out of his mind or is he someone on track and there's
different ideas that come around him makes me wonder I don't even think scholars like you said
it's it's a subject that's interesting stimulating but nobody I think will know concretely till we
can get some archaeology or something scientific you know to back it up yeah there's a lot of things
in the story that don't really make a lot of sense like why would they bury him why would they put a
big stone in front of him why would they put guards in front of them none of that makes sense the
Romans would not do any of that they just like bury them in mass grave just like everybody else
they wouldn't take him off they wouldn't give him to the family there'd be no reason to do any of that
Pontius probably wouldn't have spent any time on these people at all like what what is what is all
of this in the story it just seems like it's been embellished but because of things like crucifixion
were so common back then it's like if I if I told you I saw a dog it's just it's so easy for that
to have happened rejecting that as a possibility seems less reasonable than just saying yeah it
probably happened because it's so common at that time period that I think there are at least other
70 other people who claim to be the Messiah at the same time as Jesus that we know about from the
same kinds of writings of Josephus and the most productive time period so to reject that even
that occurred would be like saying no no no you didn't see a dog yesterday I don't believe you saw
a dog and that is a that claim has a much higher burden of proof than just believing yeah he probably
saw a dog so because history has such a low bar of evidence I think it's reasonable to believe Jesus
was probably a person that was just really embellished let me ask you this and and tying
into the crucifixion idea I don't I don't think and there might be some mythos out there that I
don't even know you can call a mythosist in the same way that you would call someone like
dr. Kerry or dr. Bob that may think that crucifixion never happened or something I don't know but
I don't think these guys are saying there's no crucifixion and approaching at that angle that men
who were rebels or that were leaders of some sort against Rome definitely got crucified
I don't deny that I know that's history I mean if you look at any of these historians especially
Josephus he's big on explaining what happened to Jews during that time and so if we take that
that path you're talking about it's easy to say this guy did but what if um and I I'm only
speculating here but I think it's a good a good point because this literature it's not like what
we're reading with the Romans it's like it's easy to see that you know they embellished some of the
things that the Romans the Roman caesars may have done and made them divine and oh he vespasian
healed the blind with spittle which is interesting that Jesus did the same thing um there's so many
aspects that make me think this is a this is more of a literature and that could this guy whose name
means the savior so to speak generically speaking like Joshua could this guy be created now I know
that you're saying it's it's more probable that a guy did exist I just wonder man it's an interesting
question to me that they would backdate a story 40 years to the day of the temples ending at 73
you know you've got Jesus dying approximately 30 33 years you know ad it's they put it roughly
nobody can prove any of this stuff but I'm just making the point like it seems more theological
and it's so theological I have a hard time wondering what is really concrete were men crucified
yeah absolutely no doubt um but it's like uh trying to find out the needle in the haystack is real
it's this big haystack that I know has so much theology and it's absolutely not true in so many
ways at least from my perception and then I see it repeat itself in the Old Testament and I go
well what the heck like that Joseph story when he gets sold off into slavery by his brothers
the brother who sold him off was Judah Judas Judah for how many pieces of silver so there's
a parallel here and he follow him into Egypt and he's in the he's in the Potiphar's house notice
he's he's a slave in Potiphar's house and here Jesus is in Pontius Pilate's house and uh or at
least under his domain he sleeps with his wife ends up in the dungeon here's two men talking about
their dream he says hey the three baskets on your head to the baker and then the three wine for the
great press or whatever well you got the wine bearer and you've got the the baker and he says
look in three days this means in three days you the wine bearer will be back up there with Pharaoh
but you the baker are actually going to be resurrected and killed you know your head's
going to be on a stake the birds of the air the fowls blah blah blah well that's the the the
Eucharist that's that whole the wine and the bread is the Eucharist and notice when the wine
bearer goes up Joseph tells the guy don't forget about me what's Jesus said as disciples do this
in remembrance of me and it's like this when you see the literature that way and I've been delving
into this for quite some time I have such a hard time Tom letting go of is this just purely fabricated
text here trying to explain why their Messiah never came to begin with and they put the Messiah
at this time in history during a time where they got their asses handed to them and I don't know I
just I just wonder like why this Jesus guy what did he really do to be that significant if he was
a real guy instead of Judah the Galilean who was a badass I mean that guy went down in history as a
warrior against Rome what did Jesus do and so I have questions that's all I'm just throwing
out actually I agree with pretty much all of that so I think that most of the story about Jesus was
essentially modified to make it fit the Old Testament they saw something in the Old Testament
that seemed like it could be a prophecy how can we make this fit this story let's add this in
like the tomb I don't think there was actually a tomb with a big stone and the the guards I don't
think that happened I don't think a lot of things that was planned like I don't think Jesus went into
the desert for 40 years or 40 days or whatever it was tempted by Satan all of that is just fabricated
to make it fit the Old Testament say oh here's this part this could actually fit if we add this
story in over here to make it look like he actually fills these Old Testament prophecies in some vague
sense but I think that if we think about it why would they add an extra person and not just use an
existing person who's crucified and make that person's life 50 stories because most of the
stories can definitely fabricated but why would they fabricate them from nothing instead of start
with a real person and that's a good point that's a good point so so if we start with there was a
there was a guy as you're saying my question would be and based off what you've researched because
dude this is something we can keep going on and on and I know this is a definitely an awesome
topic it's just I don't think we'll ever know for sure but I love stimulating the thought
so I want to ask you what do you think Jesus had that was so special for him to be used as that
person because if he was this person and they started said let's use him was he a perfect
example of someone that and nobody really knows about this guy let's just throw him in the mix
because he's just a basic common person in Israel so we'll use him as somebody crucified who was
really on the side the low the meek the this guy who's just a perfect example of a basic Jew
or was he somebody of importance that they said we need to use I don't know you know what I mean
I'm just throwing it out there yeah my thought is that there was nothing special about him at all
it was just because we know that there are like 70 other people who are confirmed who also claim
to be the Messiah at that time period and millions of others all throughout time of all
statues of rich and famous and powerful and meek and mild this guy just happened to be the one that
caught on you probably because of like Peter or his followers was really charismatic and outspoken
and could get people to follow them and that's kind of how he gained popularity probably and it
really had nothing to do with him at all nothing to do with Jesus and had more to do with his followers
being charismatic and trying to promote belief in that system and so I don't think there's anything
special about Jesus that just happened to be the one idea that caught on can we look at
besides around the world today like the silly the silly the guy who's claims to be the resurrected
Jesus in Russia today like why this guy he was like a traffic cop like what did he do to get
these thousands of followers it's just a random guy in the middle of Russia like I don't think
there's anything special about Jesus which is why it's more likely that he was a real person and
not just made up because if he was made up why would he be so mundane the fact that he's so mundane
means it means it's really strange to make up a character who's going to be a god and just make
so bland in so many ways and he just does everything that's already known like oh he was
crucified oh he was born in Bethlehem but wait what was this whole Nazareth thing we got to make
that fit like why is why even do that in the first place if he was a made-up character you just kind
of born in Nazareth or born in Bethlehem wherever you wanted him to be why haven't born in a different
city it makes so the fact that there's so many mundane silly things in there makes me think he
was probably based off a little real guy in some sense and then just embellished kind of just
the silly the Russian guy or Sampasibaba the Hindu guy they're just random people who have
random jobs who do stuff and talk nights and then they get really famous it seems like that happens
all over the world and the fact that it's pretty mundane makes me think it's more likely he was
a real person who just did the same kind of thing then he was just made up from nothing
do you do you also line yourself up with like what Bart Ehrman would say cognitive dissonance
and their extreme belief in that this guy needed to rise from the dead so they believed he rose
from the dead cognitive dissonance approach that they may have had hallucinations in a supposing
this is the approach I think even Richard Carrier takes that position but he does it on Paul he
doesn't do it on disciples of Jesus but he says Paul may have literally been trippin he might have
been a guy who's schizophrenic or who knows what do you take that approach that these guys were
really just they wanted to believe it so they I guess like what we see today with this Russian
guy who knows what he did he might have pulled magic stunts out of his ass and people saw it
like he made that person's foot grow longer like you never know right I think it's more
of like a bereavement delusion so bereavement hallucinations are a pretty well-known medical
phenomenon it happens to like 17 percent of the population where someone who is important to you
dies and you can see them or hear their voice or hear incarnations of them or you see something
happen and you can't explain and you say oh that was the person doing this or like you like you
mentioned before like there are things that can happen in your life that you say oh god knew about
my life and designed it in this way well we see this happen and the same thing happened to bereavement
delusion where you see some strange thing happened that seems like a coincidence oh that was my dead
loved one who did that so we have bereavement hallucinations when you actually see and hear
people who are important to you who have died and you can experience them as if they were still there
and that's such a common thing again like 17 percent of the population well documented the
fact that if Jesus did live and did die the fact that he was so important to his gospels and his
brother and Mary and all of those people in his life it's pretty reasonable think they may have
had a bereavement delusion because it's again so common in the case of paul I'd say that was more
of a different kind of bereavement illusion where it was just guilt like he's killed so many christians
he's just riddled with guilt and that guilt can see cause him to see an incarnation of what they
described as their being their messiah which was jesus and so he could have seen that bereavement
illusion in that way where he killed all these christians he interrogated them they described
jesus over and over and over again and he creates this idea of jesus in his head goes through this
bereavement delusion through all this guilt and he sees that description that he's made up in his
head from all the people he's talked with and he sees the embodiment of that in his bereavement
illusion and then he can then translate that to describe it to james and peter when he's talking
with them about uh he had this vision was this really jesus and they could have been convinced by
that because he had talked with so many christians and where do these christians get their idea
of jesus well they got it from peter and james so it makes it's reasonable to assume that he
got his vision of jesus from the christians he tortured which is why peter and uh james would
have believed him because that's essentially just second hand evidence of what they claim jesus to be
so all of that just seems to be classical bereavement delusions from my perspective
you notice something that um we started like any christian right the christians start with
there's a divine creator they start with this whole outside and then somehow they get from
because everything that has a cause has you know like they go all these arguments and next thing
you know they end up a christianity somehow and jesus is god and and well we just did the same thing
from a totally different point and we're like so do you think there's a channel universe
by the way what about this text you know what i'm saying so that was really cool tom so tell
people how can they contact you how can they get a hold of you how can they support you
oh yeah my main source of media is my youtube channel youtube.com slash tjump i do my debates

challengers on his show um you can support me on patreon i believe it's just patreon.com slash
tjump i appreciate any any donations so i can keep doing my debates it's my full-time job actually
as a youtuber it's pretty cool really appreciate uh this community on the atheist and christian side
they're both really generous and that's uh been a blessing thank god hallelujah
no that's awesome i'm gonna put all this down in the description so if you're watching you
don't have to worry about where it's at and if you really want to know just go to his youtube
channel hit that subscribe hit that bell so you can be notified when he has something go live
you do a lot of lives on youtube or is it all pre-recorded or is it both
usually they're all live i do all the stuff on my channel is live and then i
do the debates on modern day debates i usually copy those over so those are pre-recorded but
mine are always live well i can tell you you got a wealth of knowledge man you you've done some
research and i really enjoy this i gotta go watch you and bob go at it i wonder how bob
responded to some of these things or if you guys even talked about some of the stuff that way
i really appreciate you coming on the show man and and definitely would love to come
and join you sometime maybe have a three-way where you me and pine creek we could probably get some
more youtubers to come together and throw ideas around you know yeah cam get cam in there too
cam let's get cam i've wrote him and he's in the uk or something i'm i'm not sure
yeah he recently moved from like california to netherlands or finland somewhere in the europe
yeah he was his time was different he was working when it was like way too late you know i was like
huh um where are you located brother uh minnesota so i'm north of you on the opposite side of america
how cold was it up there it's freezing outside right now it was like six degrees yesterday it's
ridiculous man why i dude i'm glad to meet you i consider your friend and i love your approach
keep that um approach i really really appreciate and respect you for being kind to people who are
believers because the same way and i had one person i gotta get him on the show his name's
james i don't know his last name and even if it did i wouldn't want to throw it out there unless
he told me that i could he said that there's been a lot of research in terms of um having a mental
disorder okay you've got uh i don't know if it's a mental disorder or mental illness but he ties
one of those two into believing like religion and there's something there there's some science behind
it and a lot of uh a lot of uh doctors and scientists who've done some research over a long
period of time he sent me this list i did not even go through it was too long and i said okay if this
is what you think you got to come on the show sometime to share your research or what you found
out that they actually did not back when they were talking about this these doctors 20 30 years ago
a couple decades back didn't mention christianity did not do it for political reasons because they
would have been in serious trouble trying to throw out that there's mental illness attached to this
or at some way shape or form there's something there that's attached to belief in the way that a
lot of christians are looking at it i don't know about ones that are like what you're dealing with
because they're very sophisticated and they just they really are saying we don't know and i think god
you know or whatever my experience tells me that god is there i don't know man if i find out if he
if he'll do a show and he comes on i'm sure he'd be a guest you'd be interested in having a dialogue
with as well yeah it's a interesting topic um essentially religious belief fits every one of
the definitions of what a delusion is except medically delusions are not considered to be
things that are usually socially accepted and popular because it can just be a social belief
that's instilled in you as a child in which case it wouldn't be a delusion in that same way
but it's like it's exactly the same it fits the definition of a delusion exactly except for that
one feature is that it's socially uh culturally transitioned kind of a thing which gives it like
an exception in the medical literature that's crazy i mean that's who made that the norm bro
we need to get a time machine to fix some of this stuff because uh that makes me wonder about
slavery too and i know there's moral talks about that with the bible and stuff and how we view things
today looking back like was it okay to own humans like that i mean that's i don't know
i don't know well thanks brother i appreciate it and i love you guys thanks for joining in myth vision
