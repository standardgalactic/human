Don't hold back. Don't hold back.
Oh, I'm not.
I'm making sure we can.
It looks like
we're going to have to rent a road
to back us.
Maybe some underwear.
Maybe some underwear.
Maybe some underwear.
Let's see. Yeah, I think so.
It's a box.
It looks like we got a pay to go in here
to change into our white robes
so our cents can be forgiven and cleansed.
We got to wait to get one of those.
That's the dirt
that Jesus had to fill
on his feet at the bottom of the Jordan?
Yeah. I'm going dirty.
You just got to go like Jesus.
Yeah, you got to go in like Jesus.
Go in like Jesus. You got a pay
to go in there, I guess.
Alright, on a serious note
I'm about to baptize Nil
and my queen, Mrs. Mythvision
giving her an empowerment
of what we're doing here
on those river Jordan.
Hopefully somewhere
near the place where Jesus himself
baptized and was baptized.
Yeah, everybody else
makes it so
so exciting.
We got to baptize in the name of Mythvision
here.
So,
Nil,
you wrecked me.
You
can't I go off in my own little thing?
You can do your own little thing.
Good. That's what I wanted to know.
Because he's a wrecked little
wicked little thing.
He needs him.
No, Peter, look at his face.
His face is crawling with wickedness.
Listen, here's the deal, man.
Once you're done with this
I hope you understand
there's no going back.
This is like the crimson of blood, bro.
Maybe I do have some thoughts.
Maybe I do want to see it.
I don't think I'm ready.
I'm about to make you
I'm about to make you
You think if I do this I'll have more faith?
Does this work that way?
I'm about to cast the Spirit of Mythvision
in you so hard, bro.
My face will show up on it.
Yeah, we have like
Jesus is on our chest here.
But Nil didn't get it
because he's a real Evianite
and they don't like Jesus, you know what I mean?
We're going down to the river.
Only special people
live in a van
down by the river.
Here.
That's cold.
That's cold.
All right, look, man.
Let me tell you how it's going to go.
Is that fish nibbling on my foot?
Dude, the fish nibble on your heels.
I swear, bro,
they're like going for the little
Honey, this tickling
right now.
Hey, let's go right here
because this actually
well, you want to be in the open, don't you?
Yeah.
No, we're not. We're good.
Right here.
All right.
Dude, watch.
They're going to nibble your feet. I promise you.
Good. You good?
All right, we need your face.
Are we in the shot?
All right.
Do you need it?
Do you need to be in the shot here?
Or like you want your face like this?
The fish. Just fish.
Trust me. Okay.
The fish and fishers have met.
Here we are today.
Neil, you're 33 years
of age.
You're supposed to be crucified in just
a couple more months.
And you're here
to attain true gnosis.
I hear you're on a path. You're on a journey.
It is today, young man.
You give your life over
to absolute gnosis.
Bro, they're nibbling
my toes.
They sense the radiance
here. That's what's going on.
We are in the Jordan River right now.
And my son,
welcome to the cult of MythVision.
Are you ready to be baptized?
Are you willing to turn
your life over?
We are MythVision.
By grabbing your head and dunking you?
I guess.
We are MythVision.
Yes!
He saved.
Honey?
Come in.
Listen, it's going to be different.
You have never felt little fishies.
Dude, tell her.
Do you want to be here while I do it?
It's different, isn't it?
Bro, these fish, I swear,
I've never felt anything like this.
Jump a little more.
Keep them under.
Do you have the mic still?
Yeah, for her.
Come, my queen. Do you want to stay in the
Netherlands?
Honey, I'm getting
nibbled as we speak.
I'm going to need you to try, okay?
Like, the people in the camera
don't understand what's going on right now
on my feet. I have like 80 fish
nibbling on every
little portion of my toes.
Are you going to throw them like that?
I'm going to bring it in.
I'm not going in the water at all.
I will not do that to your mic.
Come on, honey.
Come here. Baby, baby.
Hold my hand.
Hold your cult leader's hand.
It's really cold.
You're going to want to...
This is so odd.
No, come on.
Babe, come here.
We have to baptize you
in the name of myth vision.
This is a once in a lifetime ordeal.
Salvation is for sale after this, okay?
I'm not giving it away for free after this.
It's cold.
Oh, my God. There's so many fish.
All right.
Come on, baby. Come on in here.
You're not.
You have to go under.
You didn't know that?
You're off the Jordan River.
You're going under.
Hold on. Sit still.
I want fish.
Hold on.
Come here.
You have to join me.
Come here.
You really have to join me.
I have to baptize you.
Honey, they're fish.
Be careful.
Listen, for you putting up with me
the cult leader of myth vision,
so long, Mrs. Myth Vision,
I now baptize you in the name
Wee.
I'm just going to put you under myth vision.
The fish are unbelievable in here.
All right.
Well,
that was fun.
Honey,
I watched them.
They were nibbling on my toes and my heels
and
I'm out here, my little...
Yeah.
I know.
I think I sort of want to dunk in the water.
I know.
I know.
I think I sort of want to dunk them in,
you know, like you did me.
Seriously, you can hold me under.
That looks like a damn snake.
It's not. It's just...
Trust me, it's not.
You sure? Yeah. Come over here.
Careful of the mic.
You're going to say whatever words you want
because you are queen of myth vision.
So you may...
So I can...
Yes, if you want to just...
You know?
Okay, no, I don't know.
Go ahead.
Whatever you want.
I don't know what to say.
You have dealt with my wickedness
in my wild, crazy butt
for 15, 16 years.
So say your piece
and slam me and drown me under the water.
Don't tempt me.
Go ahead.
Don't tempt me with a good time.
Hold your nose. I don't need to.
I know how to...
I'm casting the demons out of you.
I think there's a fish in my dress
in my gown.
It's cold in it.
It's a lot different.
It's a little bit more clean
and don't you think?
I feel like I'm part of myth vision
and it's my makeup all messed up.
No, you're fine, baby.
You look beautiful.
Well, real quick, just want to mention...
Can I give these to you, sir?
I guess we need these.
We've been getting congratulated
on our way out
and it feels special
to have been in the Jordan
and definitely did it under heretical circumstances
but...
it's different.
You're embarrassing me, stop.
Thank you.
