also up for purchase with the Black Friday Special. The Black Friday Special ends Monday,
so jump on it while you can now to get that discount. And next Friday, the gospel course with
Robin Faith Walsh will be ready for viewing. And I hope everybody checks them out and make sure
you sign up for the courses while we have the special out. I really appreciate everybody
working hard to try and bring more courses. We have some in the works right now that we're
trying to get. Joshua Bowen did a few courses with us. Karakuni Egyptologists going into creation
mythology and resurrection mythology in ancient Egypt. There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're
working on and potential academic courses that we're planning on doing in the near future,
especially the next year. Thank you, everybody. Jump on the Black Friday Special. The code
