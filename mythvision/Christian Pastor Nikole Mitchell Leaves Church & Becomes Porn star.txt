Welcome to MythVision Podcast, we got something new and different for you today.
I have a special guest, Nicole Mitchell.
Welcome.
Hi, thank you so much for having me.
Thank you.
And we have the Queen of MythVision joining my wonderful wife, Ryan, and I appreciate
both of you joining me today because this is one of those topics that if I was just
a dude up here talking about, it's like, hold up, hold up.
We really should get the voices from those who, the females, who are actually able to
express themselves in different ways than just typical guys.
But I'm sure that anyone watching can learn a thing or two from this discussion, even
if they don't maybe draw certain conclusions themselves.
But Christianity has really played a significant role, I would say, in how I viewed myself,
my sexuality, very damaging perception of myself throughout my entire career as a Christian.
And so let's have some fun.
I'm going to do my little intro and then we're going to have a conversation with you about
your story and allow my wife, of course, to maybe get her ideas out as well.
Great.
Or ask questions.
Yeah.
But yeah, everyone watching, they're actually lucky because Nicole, she doesn't usually
join us on Miffission until it's a topic that she really is into.
You know, like cults or this, you know?
It's either cults or sex, you know?
So basically.
Let's get the party started.
Son, do you want to know what the truth is?
After this, there's no turning back.
You take the blue pill and you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to.
You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland.
And I show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
all right that was so good i got goosebumps watching that thank you thank you yeah um
she helped me pick out the music too because we could we had it for a while but we didn't know
we didn't have the right kind of music the feels that go along with the experience we
wanted people to get and that is kind of the exiting the cave of ignorance video you know
yes thank you for that compliment so first question and i think me and ryan would both
think this is a good one by the way everyone in the chat who thinks that she's here to babysit
she could just be sitting over there in the corner to babysit you know but like that's what
i would typically do guys yeah just so you know in case you think there's babysitting going on um
but people are gonna think and no matter what certain versions of christianity are gonna say
you were never really a true christian okay this is obvious in their theology the way that they
express it they think the same thing of me but i'm gonna listen to your voice tell me about your
experience because i think that you're going to tell us what really was going on and the question
i have is were you serious were you absolutely sincere as a christian like was this really your
life i mean your pastor tell me about it yeah i get that because it depends what sect of christianity
we're referring to there's like the sect of christianity that says once you're saved you're
always saved so even if i've taken this big transition in my life they would technically say i guess
she's technically still christian and then you have the sect of christianity that like this is so
blasphemous there's no way she could have ever been and i just let them duke it out and i just
live my very beautiful life um but yeah when i was in it i was all the way in it i was the most
authentic sincere believer that's just who i am i'm very authentic in everything i do which is
i'm authentic behind the pulpit i'm authentic in my porn like it i'm still very much the same
and i i very quickly in a very young age drink the water right the lemonade of the community i
grew up in which is women are meant to be good girls we're meant to be good wives good mothers
and obedient and submissive and play small and serve in the kitchen and serve in the the nursery
was literally the messaging i got as a child and i wanted nothing more than to be the woman
that apparently god wanted me to be based on what all the men in my church were telling me
and so i that's all i wanted i want to be married to a man i wanted to have his babies i wanted to
stay at home mom because that apparently was the pinnacle of my entire existence and then i became
all that i married a man i had three children with him i was a stay-at-home mother and i was
absolutely miserable and just one of many examples where i felt i got duped where i was told that this
thing was true i finally experienced it for myself and it could not have been further from the truth
and it just forced me to sit with how long am i going to let someone else tell me what the truth
is how long am i going to live by someone else's script at what point am i finally going to say
enough is enough now i want to know what my truth is i want to know what my path is because i think
at the end of the day now i know this back then i didn't but i now at the end of the day the only
person who knows what path is meant for me is me but it's a very smart oppressive tool the patriarchy
is to tell entire groups of people i know it's best for you don't trust yourself only trust me
that'll keep someone powerless for a really long time wow i mean that's profound what a great episode
everybody liked the video oh this is a good way to kick it off because i feel what you're saying
i feel like i tell ryan all the time i'm like i feel like i found myself i've been told what to
believe what to think here's your book i mean in this same book the bible women to get salvation
in one of the pastoral's need to be baby making machines if you want to be saved come on right
yeah what about women who can't bear children what about women who don't want children
what about women who can't get married like there is this like now that we're outside of that bubble
and like can see see things from a completely different perspective like i realized so much
of what i believe will literally make zero sense but back then i'm like this is the greatest most
profound thing and so it's just like i have to have so much grace for myself because i could easily
go down a really dark hole like how dumb and how duped can you be but that was the that was the
whole point was if you want to convince someone of anything if you want to keep them under control
you convince them of really bizarre things so you feel isolated you feel like the martyr
and then when you get out of that and you realize how illogical um unethical some of these teachings
are it just dispels all its power do you have a question how did you get to that point though
to where you were confident enough to um open yourself up to those possibilities
yeah i was kind of like i kind of like my hand was forced i'm i'm a sincere believer i'm very easy
to like duped i like if you say something i'm like oh really they're like no nicole that was sarcasm
i'm like i'm just kind of like you're not yes i'm global i'm so global because i'm like i'm just
such a lover and i just want to believe you and i think especially after my upbringing where i was
never believed it is so important to me that i believe people so actually sarcasm is really hard
for me because i just believe you um but yeah i i my whole life i believed i believed i believed i
believed and it wasn't until really in 2016 i realized i was queer and my whole life i thought i
was straight and i had this reckoning of holy crap i'm in my 30s and i don't even know my own
sexuality what else do i think i know that i could be completely wrong on and that began this
journey for me of like unlearning and peel backing peel back peeling back the layers of like is this
my truth or is that what someone told me was to be true that that this is true is this my belief
or was this someone else's belief put on me and i had no idea what this journey is gonna lead me i
was actually really afraid because i felt like kind of the matrix i like woke up and i'm like whoa
take me back i didn't i didn't ask for this i was very happy my little bubble of my little life
i was so scared but also something in me had always wondered all along like is this really
it's like is this really the some total of my existence and that forced me to start
unpacking unlearning and it led me to realizing completely new but always been there truths about
me so this is an interesting thing i mean i'm going to be very transparent and i think it's
okay that i do that with both of you here and that is as a young man who hit puberty i discovered
playboy magazines in fact my dad used to give them to me in the whole nine and as a young man who
hit puberty i would watch pornography and i got kind of in this habit of doing it my whole upbringing
but i was it was a shame thing it was you're looking at a woman wanting the lust for her you
know the gist i'm sure you've probably preached the messages as a pastor in church at times probably
while you're saying it probably this is kind of dumb but uh um you know like we we were fed this
and i i in my mind i guilted myself forever like the whole time there was a shame and guilt
you feel disgusted with yourself um you just you just you take those passages of jesus you
almost want to interpret them literally cut your hand off and throw it into the fire if it causes
you to send pluck your eye out literally like you almost want to do it just so you don't have to
keep doing what you're doing to yourself and it's totally normal and natural and anyway you want to
comment on that yes like it makes my heart grieve so much that we are so afraid of pleasure
like we have this gift as human beings to experience so much pleasure in our lifetime
and yet we have so much shame and fear and guilt wrapped up in it that we will literally do extreme
things like that like separate ourselves from our loved ones because we're not supposed to have sex
with them before marriage right or like right like deny ourselves our own pleasure our own
release at night like i remember i would try so hard not to masturbate at night but i can fall
asleep like that if i masturbate and i'm just like all tense and i'm like again like i'm like
literally causing my sleep to suffer which causes my next day to suffer because i'm not willing to
take the short amount of time to let my body get endorphins to have a deep sleep like we deny ourselves
so much and it's been part of my job like since getting into this lifestyle that i'm in and i'm
also a life coach i help clients cultivate new levels of pleasure because we've spent our whole
lifetime denying ourselves it wow that's something i also forgot to do an apologies to you is to
mention your website you have your life coach you also are on only fans you have i mean you're
literally all over the place you have courses and stuff so tell us about your website let's do a
short little shameless plug for you and then we'll get back to discussing you're so sweet yeah i um i'm
a life coach i work one one with clients i teach live digital courses um i have an only fans for
all my adult content i have youtube videos that kind of document my journey um from going straight
to queer um addressing all the clobber passages in the bible and then just meditation videos that i
now make for my clients um as a way like i live a very beautifully integrated life between the
spiritual and the sexual the professional and the personal and i think it's really unique because
in either industry like personal development or the spiritual community or the adult industry
you are typically forced to pick one or the other and i refuse i refuse that i have to be one
dimensional we're all multi-dimensional so why can't i be that way in my business and career and
that's like my website kind of reflects that you're gonna find all my life coaching stuff you're
gonna find my adult content you're gonna find social media because i'm the whole package this
is who you are is what you're telling us yeah so two let's let's keep unraveling the onion here
there's so many layers to this amazing picture here you're painting because we we actually
i get a lot i don't know if you you get sometimes i'm sure but people will say
oh the reason you're not a christian the reason you're not you just want to send a call you just
want to live in the flesh and that's why you're not a christian now i understand that that is a
benefit to not being a christian is that you actually get to be who you are and enjoy being
without a book telling you these things but is that the reason you're not like a pastor anymore
is that what would you say oh my god if you're saying i don't like by living a life sin you mean
feeling good about who i am enjoying the life that i live experiencing incredible amounts of
pleasure and being completely shame-free about it yeah i've chosen life and it's a very very good
life but it's it's not like when i left the christian faith it wasn't like let me dive into it was
i was never that bold i was really timid and afraid because i was leaving everything i knew
i was leaving my community i was leaving my people i was leaving my flock i was leaving
all of my friends because all of my friends are from my church and i was like i felt like Elsa
like in this world this kingdom very isolated bubble and this whisper was saying but go there's
something out there or moana really spoke to me leaving her island when her parents like no this
is where you stay this is your role and she's like but there's something in the ocean beckoning me to
leave the island the place that i love and it is terrifying but you kind of reach a point where you
have no choice but to go because you just know you're not meant to stay where you are even though you
have no idea where you're about to go so i was very timid and afraid and i was constantly questioning
am i making the right decision will i regret to you know that i ever made this choice to walk away
what if my children resent me because when i left i took my children with me i pulled them from the
church as well i pulled them from their friends as well like what if they hate me like constant
questioning and i thought is this how i'm going to live the rest of my life always wondering if i
made the right decision and it took about two two and a half years where i finally reached a point
where i no longer question and i knew oh this is why i was called to leave because this is my truth
and now i have total peace and i love my life and i don't ever regret for a second walking away
anything for you um i did have a question so like when you got to the point to where you
realized you were queer what was the event that really took place that you know made you realize
that yeah or even like yeah yeah i wish i had a hot story like i actually made out with a woman
i like i wasn't like that but i was a song i kissed a girl and i liked it or something
yes oh my god i love that song i still love that song all these signs along the way right like i
look back now and it's all so obvious i have so many signs from what from when i was a little girl
that i was into women and i'm into all genders but um back then um it's actually i give credits
to my church because our head pastor is like something christians aren't good at is learning
the perspective of the other side we're so busy shoving our perspective down people's
threats we actually never slow down to ask them their perspective read their side of the story
look for their opinion so i did that i took a queer theology course online i started reading
books by queer theologians i started following the social media and everything clicked and made
sense of me and then i was like well i was never like anti-gay you know i was raised in an anti-gay
environment because i'm just a lover at my heart i that's never been me so then i'm like i'm gonna
become like the biggest ally so i um started supporting a local queer theologian in my town
and started going to queer events to be an ally and the more i went to these queer spaces
i'd feel this magnetic attraction to a lot of people in her room i'm like i'm just a lover
i just love people and i love humans and then it was like the third time i went to an event and i
felt that same magnetic attraction to a queer person and i was like oh i don't think i'm straight
i don't know what i am but this isn't me loving people this is me being attracted to different
kinds of people oh i'm queer and then it was like this moment where i was like i can pretend i
never admitted that to myself and i will take it to the grave because i look straight i sound
straight i pass the streaks i'm married to a dude like no one needs to know this this will only
bring pain into my life and then just being the authentic person i am i was like i can't do that
i can't take it to the grave and so i bravely began to bring it to my people and slowly kind of
embraced my queer life and it's honestly brought me so much joy it is there's pain that came with
it at first but i don't regret it a bit and i honestly wish i had known much much earlier in life
if we can poke into that pain a little and i know that you know you've healed i'm sure or
there may be things we're still working on for the rest of our lives but that that experience
of figuring out who you are and and all that comes with it you've found a way within christianity to
kind of come to this conclusion um what what was some of the issues you had to hurdle because i
tried emailing you a few years ago and you mentioned uh you know you were going through
some tough times i think the transition was happening somewhere around the time i started
this video where you were going from pastor to um being yourself yeah there's a lot at stake right
like i was afraid for my marriage um even though my husband like he was the one person i knew i could
come out to and he would love and accept me completely he's he was always very open-minded
back then and so i he was the first person i told and he was like so happy for me he like pulled
me in his arms he's like i'm so happy for you like i think that's totally normal and natural and i
can't wait to see what else you discover about yourself like he was so supportive of my freedom
um but i still had fears like what if i become too much for him or you know my family is was
raised in a homophobic culture so like what if i lose my family my parents my siblings over this
my best friends who even though we went to kind of open-minded christian church still homophobia
was the norm so it's like what if they think i'm a weirdo and they no longer want to be my friend
they no longer let their kids hang out with my kids so just even owning my queerness brought
up a lot of fear you can imagine how much more fear i had about creating adult content like that
will very clearly um let you let you know who is your person and who isn't who is your friend
and who isn't because it's either you love it or you hate it there's no middle ground with adult
content and so this is like am i willing to say yes to this calling on my life even with the the
risk and then knowing that i will probably lose everyone and i will have to start all over and i
i wrestled with that because again i'm a lover i want to be friends with all my people i don't
want to lose a single person but i also couldn't live a like a shallow version of myself like i felt
so like teeny tiny compared to this really powerful radiant being that i came here to be
and i felt like i was almost suffocating in the smallness of my life and i finally said i have to
follow this calling like i it's just who i am i'm just authentic and i'm willing to walk this path
for however long it is maybe it's six months maybe it's six years maybe it's 60 years i have no idea
but i'm going to take that leap and and trust and i did lose everyone right i lost my entire family
i lost my three best friends i lost my husband and yet being on this side now and having done a lot
of healing and finding my people now who not just tolerate me they celebrate me and all of my sexuality
and all of my expression and all of my power it has totally been worth it wow so how do i get there
he's ready to ditch me um uh yeah thank you for standing up for lgbt q plus people i'm gonna add
that at the end there but yeah um i really do appreciate the support and feel free to super
chat questions i'm more than happy to take them as we go along um some people might say
cool you you found yourself but you went too far uh you went all the way to full on adult
industry and doing porn and all of this porn almost sounds like a curse word because my whole
life right you're like porn oh no um but it's funny because the very thing we're talking about today
which is our sexuality and and how we express ourselves as humans is the very thing everyone
just about unless they're someone who's just not sexually i don't know they're not driven naturally
in some way um everybody wants it every it's like it's like food and water to people in their
lives they gotta drink water they gotta eat food at some point but it's don't talk about it but
they're all like probably going to your only fans or checking out your videos and like there's like
this oh no that's wrong but in reality how many of these people aren't actually watching porn or
doing something like that right right like i think most of us are sexual beings we i mean
there are asexual people that are very it's very real they're not sexually driven or don't have those
desires um but for a lot of people we do and i and i'm very very sexual i mean from a young age
in high school where i'd always joke that i was one big hormone with two little feet just running
around like i just like wanted to have sex with everyone was very sexual had a very hard time
finding anyone have sex with like no one was interested like now now that i'm regretting that
back then i was like i just want to have sex and i was afraid i wanted it and i was so afraid of it
but i think you're right i think um i've been given grief by people who i know watch porn um
and they give me grief for making it yeah like this doesn't add up you can't you can't you can't
say you're allowed to have access to it watch it view it get off to it and then tell me as a woman
i'm not allowed to create it like that doesn't compute but that's i've literally been told that
by guys in my life um and so when people say you've gone off the deep end i take it as a compliment
because i'm so done in the shallow end i'm all in on this life i've created i'm not trying to live a
safe life i'm trying to live my truest life and if the truest version of my life means going off in
the deep end and swimming and finding the depth there i'm all in i live my whole life being timid
and afraid i'm no longer afraid because i dove into the deep end and i found life there i found
love it's not as scary as people paint it it's not as bad yes like the scary it's the lead up
you know it's like when you when you're on a diving board i'm absolutely terrified of a tall
diving board at a pool but then once you're off of it you're free but the fear is all in the lead
up and once you realize for me at least that the fear wasn't ultimately true but there is so much
love and freedom and healing and wholeness and happiness and playfulness and pleasure in the
deep end i want as much of it as i can and not in an insatiable greedy gross i'll ruin anything
and everything to get it from like but from a deep desire of like i deserve pleasure i am safe
in pleasure i'm safe in playing i'm safe in exploring and the only way we as individuals
can find our line that's too much for us the line that has been crossed is oftentimes by crossing it
otherwise we constantly live in fear of an arbitrary line that probably someone else put
there but until i cross that line i actually don't know if that's my line and i can't tell
you how many lines i have crossed that were not lines for me and in fact i'm at a point where
like my the the line keeps getting further away i'm like this is amazing like i just keep going
and i'm like where's my line where's my line i you know in christianity it crossed a long time ago
but personally i've not found mine yet and i enjoy the freedom and the expansion of that yeah
wow okay um i got a super chat here you can you can even sense in this super chat um there's a
certain perception here so i i know that you can handle your your big girl you know how to handle
stuff so um yeshima the king says not an attack against nicole but when this being ran through
shameful can a line be drawn anywhere i'm having a hard time understanding a question
i don't know what ran through mean means i'm wondering that's what i was wondering if it was
if it was kind of in a way saying oh well you're being open and sexually being active with so many
people whatever um it's hard for me to read this but it's this idea it almost reminds me of the way
that men can sleep with several girls i'm not saying this is what this person's saying but
but you're a hoe or whatnot if a woman does it but if a guy but but imagine that they're saying
both right like if guys do what our girls do is just wrong because we've been told one man one woman
adam and eve you know this kind of story you want to debunk this in your mind for us yeah i just
love that here i am i make porn and i'm like what's ran through me i don't even know you know like i
love that thing there's no like and this is like my truth there's still an innocence to me there's
still a level b naive and i actually love that about myself like it comes it goes against what
we're taught that porn stars are all like ruined washed up rags of human beings and here i'm like
this cute little like almost like a sunday school girl like what's that mean like i don't know and
like i learned things from my audience like when my fans asked me like i remember a couple years
ago i had a fan asked me if i do dick ratings and i didn't even know if that was and i'm like what
is a dick rating on google like i learned terms from my people then i have to google and find it so
anyway my my question back to us this person is well what's the limit on pleasure who decides the
limit on pleasure because really this is about pleasure this isn't about a body count so just
because i have a wide capacity for pleasure i allow myself to receive what i want and i don't put
any judgment on it where why would shame ever come into that equation when this is what i want this
is what the other person wants it's consensual it's life-giving for me it's done from places desire
not like i'm trying to fill some like gaping hole it's like i just love pleasure and i love having
other people feel pleasure and then i love creating a pleasurable experiences and then i love filming
it so other people can feel pleasure for me this is a pleasure in every direction and like for me
and just because i know we briefly talked about this before the we went live like everything i
create is authentic never in any of my content will you see me fake anything because i i can't
tell them porn what's real and what's not real so my followers know anything i create is 100
authentic because i don't have time for fake i only have time for authentic encounters of pleasure
and if i happen to film it for you you're in luck because you are seen in a in an authentic
experience and encounter pleasure for the people involved and you get pleasure on it so to me i
feel like i actually dispense pleasure in every direction and because i feel no shame over it no
one else feels shame over it but it's the outsiders looking in who i actually think are genuinely
wanting it but they feel the shame and i'm trying to like bring them across the fold and say
there's no shame here there's a whole lot of pleasure there's a whole lot of safety
there's time for you to sit and ask questions you don't have to do anything you don't have to join
any and join in on any of this but i would ask that you sit with your feelings of discomfort
until they go away because life on the other side is so beautiful and free and full of pleasure
you should you should uh you should give some sermons on this
yes i know like it's not it's not as radical as people think like you know if you go in
the pulpit it's like you know shame sex and i'm just like let's talk about pleasure like we get
so in this black and white porn is good or bad wrong or evil and it's like can we even zoom
out to just focus on like are we as humans allowed to have pleasure who decides how much
pleasure we can have and that's you're hitting something so heavy because biblically speaking
you can find some clear passages about the flesh and how bad and anyway yeah you had something
yeah i i did have a question so for me um i'm the mother of three boys so i know that you're a mom
what's kind of i guess what's your method for how you introduce the kids to the you know i'm
assuming they're aware of what you do that kind of thing how do you go about doing that yeah
you're in luck i have five kids so like i have lots of experience with parenting so i have three
of my own and they're seven 10 and 12 and then i have two um bonus kids stepkids and they're um 14
and 16 and the 14 and 16 know exactly what i do they know everything they're they're teen boys
and they fully support me and they're always trying they're always coming up with ideas
of how i can make more money on my only fans and they'll tell me you should try this or you should
try this or have you thought have you thought about this and have you thought about it's like
it cracks me up these teen boys are trying to like make me more money and i've asked them before
and i've said like do your friends know what i do and they're like yeah and i'm like do they ever give
you a hard time but i'm like no why would they do that like and then they said why would we pick
friends like that we pick good friends so even like their radical self-responsibility that they
know they are responsible for the kind of humans they led into their life it's not on me to determine
like i don't decide that for them they decide that so like they're like we pick good people
and like they they don't care what you do and i think we're really fortunate this next generation
and we have really open and honest conversations even with my little kids like i have lingerie
everywhere i have sex toys everywhere i have magazines i've been published in like lingerie
there's no porn magazines that they that they've seen but they'll just ask questions and this is
such a safe home and they'll ask like why do you wear lingerie i'm like oh i'm a nude and lingerie
model uh and i recently my 10 year old because i have some pictures over here where i'm like
freshly naked i've printed in everywhere my house and then she's like is it weird mom is it weird
when the photographer she like that and i say no because they're professional i professional it's
part of my job i actually really enjoy these kind of shoes she's like i think it's weird i'm like
totally i would have thought it was weird as a kid but as an adult like adults do adult things
and kids do kid things and when you're an adult you're going to do different things and you do
your kid and all as well and we talk about consent and we talk about bodily autonomy and we
i have books everywhere on the house that are kid kid books about sex queerness um consent
i have a book called what is my vulva like very open and honest here and they are constantly just
dialoguing with me because i dispel my own shame i don't project any of that on my children and they
are able to ask me anything and i think that's what's helped them raise them to be really open-minded
grounded kids that are our results in these teen boys who pick really good people in their lives too
i think that a lot of people are handicapped going into it like with the way that
so i'm back to my whole youth right i'm only given my experience my dad handed me playboys
when he'd get drunk and condoms all right boys here you go and it was like
believe it or not that was still the cool thing and it was still better than not expressing any
of it to me and me having to discover it all by myself but um i think we could do better as parents
in communicating these things with our children young and going by the way that that natural
thing when you hit puberty and that you're attracted that you you are wanting to do this
that's normal and that way they don't have to live with what's wrong with me nothing's wrong with you
especially when society makes this taboo to even discuss so we have to break that what you're doing
is breaking through you're breaking through and i'm hoping that you're doing that here with this
episode for people that are watching of course there's some people who are going to have certain
beliefs that are just going to make them automatically want to judge or whatnot
but i think what you're doing is so important yeah it's like we're like we have so much shame
and fear around sex and then we won't even talk to our kids about it how does that help them
like how are we raising especially in the faith it's like we want to raise like really healthy
thriving young kids into who become adults and yet we won't talk to them about some of the most
important things and i always compare it because i i love money as well which is another thing that
people think i've gone off the deep end right and so it's like the two subjects in our culture we
don't talk about sex or money but you should be good at both and it's like that doesn't make sense
like if we're not talking about how can enemies we get good at it so that's why in my house like
all my kids are are readers and like so i just keep buying books about all these different topics
i want my kids to know about and i just leave them around the house and they will just naturally
pick it up and read it and they're like okay that was good mom do you have another book and because
i don't pressure them they're just constantly reading anything i put around and they're becoming
really educated and they'll ask like i'm like naked all the time my house maybe this tmi but
here's like a real like example of how i raised like shame free body positive sex positive kids
i was peeing a few weeks ago and my seven-year-old son walked by and he's like what your why does your
pee look like that coming out from down there just goes everywhere and he's and i'm like well that's
just where my pee hole is and he's like oh i remember one time he told me that you have three holes
down there where are they so i pull up an anatomy chart as i'm literally on the toilet and i have
like there's this animated drawing and i'm like here is the clitoris here is your uretha this is
where my pee comes out here's the vagina this is where blood and babies come out because he knows
like in my period he knows blood comes out and then this is your butt hole and then he's like well
what's this and i'm like oh that's the labia and he's like well why is there like two parts i'm like
oh that's the inner labia and that's the outer labia and he's like oh that makes sense because one's
on the inside one's on the outside i'm like yeah he's like cool and he ran off so instead of me most
parents institution like oh my god don't look i like don't open the door close the door how dare you
see me pee it's like i'm like oh yep this is just what it is this is what it looks like and he had
questions and i think kids are naturally inquisitive but when we shame them because we don't we feel
uncomfortable those questions never get to surface and then we temporarily feel comfortable because i'm
like okay i'm not supposed to talk about that but then now they have to go find out on their own
and we will that's why like someone who might have even so there's a sense in me right i'm
still coming out i'm still learning about who i am and trying to be a better human just to be a human
and there's a point in me where i'm thinking about how would i have that conversation with my kids but
then in my mind i'm like actually in high school sex ed they're going to say everything you just
said the difference is you you're demanding someone else teach your children instead of you
why not go ahead and teach them so that they're better prepared and understanding and and you
know can be i guess you'd say ready for when they are trying to experiment or figure out the
world around them because we all did it like yeah and it's not a one-time conversation and that's
the downside of sex ed in schools it's not like there's so much when it comes to sex there's there's
consent there's safety there's contraception there's pleasure there's orgasms there's positions
there's power differentials differentials between like men and women there's like trans sex there's
like there's so much to unpack that like it should be something we are constantly having
questions and conversations about and not ever putting off to like oh once our 13 hit period
off the top or once they're in middle school they'll have sex education it's like we should
always be talking about these things because there's so much to it and i want my kids ultimately
they're most of them are going to probably have sex right and if they're going to have sex i want
them to be safe and i want them to know what consent is i want them to know what contraception
they have available i want them to know when they feel ready to ever involve pregnancy or not like
there's so much i want them to be prepared for that i would never let leave that to the internet
leave that to simply porn magazines when i could be having these conversations they're awkward
they're uncomfortable but they get easier the more you do it right did you want to have some
okay so so so uh porn this is the deep end we're in the deep end conversation for those
who are here you're chewing meat this is no longer milk for the babes um you you found out who you
were and you found yourself able to do this what led you to become a porn star and i guess it was
a natural succession of things what was that i guess you'd say what when you left being pastor
discovered your queerness and all of this and your sexuality and just started flowering
what were the steps that got you to porn and a lot of people will say well there's a lot of bad
that happens in the porn industry therefore porn is bad uh can you tackle that myth as you're kind
of just telling us your journey into pornography totally and i you know i would have agreed with
all of that back in the day but it's funny i would have agreed with that without knowing a
single thing about the porn industry it was just labeled as bad but i didn't know any stories of
anything that happened the porn industry add zero stats zero research but we we held this myth of
like it's all bad and broken and damaging so it's really interesting when it got into it finding
out how life-giving how consensual how safe things are and and i have a lot of privilege which i'll
get into but when i started this journey it was not the end goal i had no end goal i had no idea
where i was going to end up um and i just i've always been very sexual i've always been very
expressive and my whole life i spent censoring myself i censored my body because i was covering
it up because i'm responsible for how men treat me apparently um i was afraid of offending anyone
by saying certain things i always censored myself in every way possible and i reached a point where
like i was done like i deserve a voice i deserve my truth i deserve wearing what i want saying what
i want being what i want and so i went on this journey of like of self-expression and so when
i learned about only fans i was like oh my god there's a platform where i can post sexy photos of
myself like this is like available i was so excited because for years my best friend had been taking
naked photos of me whenever we got together and i had nowhere to post them i would have posted these
photos on instagram had instagram allowed me so i started my only fans as a platform of purely
self-expression i wanted to post my sexy photos which were very very mild compared to what i make
today but for me they're really radical and scandalous like implied lingerie nothing you didn't see
me my bits but everything was covered but very sexy and i just wanted a place to post photos
i loved this was for me and if you happen to subscribe and enjoy it alongside of me you're
welcome but it is first and foremost for me and so the more i did it i realized oh i really
like being paid for my sexy photos and i've come to find out about myself i love when sex and money
is combined which is another thing that's important to help others follow your path here
how often honey when we're looking in the mirror and we're actually going to the gym like we should
and and we're looking and we're like oh hold on i like that six pack and my arms are looking good
whatever we are it helps us feel good about ourselves to know that we're taking care of ourselves
so you're just saying you're already doing that you love how you look you love how you feel
why not get paid to do what you already do and it incurred it actually helped you it almost put
a boost behind you yeah to do it even more to take better care of your whole to okay sorry just
had to make yeah being a nude model really inspires you to take care of your health okay like if you
want to like take care of your body be naked in front of people like it's going to force you to show
up for yourself in a way that if it's just for you you probably would never get around to so like
there's actually some like really common sense basic common sense about this industry like if
you want to take care of your body be a porn star right if you want to like become a really good at
having sex become a porn star like you just learn things i just learned things i never would have
learned had i not gotten into this industry but that's not why i started right it's for me to
express myself that i found this boost of like oh my god i'm already taking these sexy photos
now i'm making money off of it i think i'm cool with this and i just i kept just checking in to
find out where's my line right and the beginning of my line was like no no nude nude it was all
implied everything had to be covered but i'm happy to be sexy and alluring and flirting but i wouldn't
show and slowly like okay i think i'm okay being maybe topless how that and i would do it and i'd
see how it feel because i could have easily said i'm only okay with topless because i have girlfriends
like that i only do topless or i only wear thongs and i'm like no i like that too and then i showed
more of my body oh i let and i just kept going and going again give myself permission for the
first time in my life to do what feels right for me not right by my pastor not right by an outsider
right for me and it led to me expressing myself and i created solo content and then i realized
i am actually closeted porn star all along and like i actually really want to film sacks and like
and create authentic experiences for people to enjoy especially because in the porn industry
so much of it is performative and that's great it's adult entertainment it they are not required
to create authentic encounters but for me because authenticity is so important to me it has to be
authentic and so i feel i get to fill a very real gap in the porn industry like if you want
something authentic and if you actually want to be in touch with the person create this content
that's what my site is for because not only do you get to consume my content we can be in the DMs
every day because i am in the DMs every day because i actually care about the human connection
so it's just actually really life-giving space that people don't realize until they're in it
we judge it we're afraid of it we think there's a lot of shame around it and then you join the
space you're like oh this is just like basic human connection authentic intentional life-giving
sensual this is really beautiful don't want to step on it do you have anything because if not i
got something so one question yeah one one question she's giving you are a pastor of a church for
reason or at least you've pastored right so you you felt a calling to connect with people to teach
to help that was already before you have figured out life coaching um it must not be a very common
thing i suspect for porn stars to also be life coaches so you're kind of um you're the four
leaf clover i think in this kind of industry because for example i got clean off of drugs
seven years ago i was i was trapped on heroin and my deconversion out of christianity helped me
to stay clean and today i don't even like it's not even a thing i literally feel like i am
recovered as they like to call it where i don't even have i don't think i'll ever relapse and
it was that experience of leaving christianity that helped me to also take what i was doing
teaching people i was going to be a pastor i was going towards seminary the whole nine
you did seminary that's another thing so like it's funny the reverse is the case for you where
some people try to do testimonies of i was abused in porn and and i found jesus what do you say that
people like that yeah porn set me free it set me free from all the body shame and sex shame and
fear and guilt and judgment and it's funny like i have a lot of privilege because all so i'm my own
boss i'm my own production company i don't work for a porn company and so i there's no middleman
so i pick my prices i pick my hours i pick what i'm comfortable with i pick the people i create
content with i'm in total control i like that i don't know if i would do well in the traditional
the traditional industry where they make all those decisions for me i like being a very powerful
woman i like being in control of my life and like and and even christians i think would hear
that like oh she doesn't trust god but i think god lives in me and i think god is really powerful
we're all powerful so it's not like it's not that um but yeah just so i have this right you
have redefined your understanding of the divine and you wouldn't label yourself an atheist but
you don't know what it is you're just experiencing life thinking there's something but it it ain't
what i thought it was it's it's something else yeah i would say yeah i'm more of an agnostic
or um a deus you and her yeah there's something out there probably i could be wrong and that's
the other thing when you have a major life transition like we've had i hold my beliefs
way looser because i have been point blank wrong on things i was willing to like lay down my life
more and if i can be that wrong before i can be wrong again and so i just hold it very loosely like
yeah there's probably god but if there isn't cool if there is cool like i it's pretty arrogant of
me to be like i have all the answers figured out when like we have how many billions of humans
how many millions of years of existence and we still don't have a lot of basic shit figured out
i'd rather be really honest with like how little i know and i'm always learning and evolving and
growing and not get too attached to being right i want to be free i want to be love i want to be
happy and i want others people to be free happy and in love with who they are and what they're
so with my porn industry because i'm not i accept everything and i control everything
there's no harm here there's no damage here there's no risk here i shoot most of my content in my
house i pick the people i feel comfortable with everyone's bedded we have a very open up front
what are you comfortable with what are you not comfortable with like basic conversation
christians don't even know how to have their own spouses in bed what do you like what do you not
like are you okay with this are you not okay with this do you would you like to try this do you
not want to try this do you like i didn't even know what consent was until five years into my marriage
i did not know i was allowed to say no i thought i was required as a wife to always say yes now
that i know this i have a lot of rage about that to have that kind of lack of agency and autonomy
in my own body and in my own marriage and so i'm very committed to raising my children all my kids
know what consent is and sometimes like if like i'm trying to get them out the door and i'll like
put my hand on my son's back who's seven i'm like okay let's go he's like i do not give you permission
to touch my body like whoop you're okay i'm sorry that's your body i don't get access to it even as
your mom it's not i don't control your body you are your own person so because i was deprived of
that until i was 30 my kids all know very clearly what consent is and you never do anything without
someone getting consent or or giving consent hmm that's a healthy practice it gets away from
the rod spoil the child too because that's it just keeps the vicious cycle going doesn't it
my kids have asked like it's come up the way i was raised right and the belt was used on me the
wooden spoon was on me spanking slapping like and they like they'll bring it up and i'll say
this is why i don't do this to you it was so traumatizing to me as a child to be hit by the
very parents who are the ones who are supposed to love you and protect you and i swore to myself
i would never hit my kids if i ever have kids and my kids have turned out amazing and i'm really
fortunate that i've not had to do that but i've had honest conversations with them it says i learned
from my upbringing what i wanted to do differently and i hope if you guys ever become parents that
you do even a better job than me i want every generation to get better i'm doing the best
that i can and i think i've done really well in many ways but please take the baton and take it
even further and do so much better than me we can and we should be doing better every generation
anything no i can't think of anything okay if you get any thoughts yeah no she's just along
the ride yes sometimes i have questions and i forget yeah sometimes you're like so deep into
the discussion that you're like not thinking of like all right we need to address this whereas
i have to do that as a host i'm like always multitasking and um this way uh this was your life
thoughts on christians converting at corn shows i think they mean yeah i'm assuming even like
christians who go there to like save porn stars i think again that's a thing oh yeah they'll like
there's like they used to have i don't know if it still exists so there's like triple x ministries
like were you going try to save porn stars because that's what they're doing right that's the only
these people are watching porn and you know it there's just no way i told and that's what i say
like when i get flack from certain people i say you're just mad because i do in public what you
do in secret yeah right that's the thing if you have no secrets if you're just an open book
what can people use against you you know yeah there's nothing that you could say that i'm not
already telling you she's pulling the eight mile thing you remember m&m was so that's why i'm saying
do you remember when m&m on the eight mile movie at the end he'd like literally just told all of his
faults and then he calls out the other guy and he's like go ahead say something that i haven't
said already about me you know exactly if you own it it can't be used against you and the people
like what are you going to do when they leak your content i'm like i leaked it first boo like
there's nothing they can do yeah that's why i put it out there i posted it first so have fun with it
but that means you do have to make peace with that like when i got to the industry i was like
whatever you post online will be leaked that is the nature of the internet so i do i do i mentor
people who want to become adult creators or only fans creators and i say you have to be you first
have to make this decision are you okay with whatever you create being leaked right because if
you're not you need to sit and think on this a little bit longer if you are cool but you just
have you cannot go into this naively thinking no one will ever know no you they will all find out
even if you try to like cover your head like certain people are going to find out yes right
like yeah if you have tattoos or if you have so anyway so you have to go into it really openly
but when it comes to like converting at corn shows at corn shows um i think like it shows their night
how naïve they are like that they think someone like me is broken or i'm being forced or i'm being
exploited when it's the exact opposite and for me personally it's all empowerment i make the
decisions i call the shots i charge the money i make the money i pick my hours i am i run the whole
entire show there is no coercion exploitation trafficking abuse of any kind and so if you try
to come convert me at a porn show i'll just like you're so cute because you have no idea what you're
talking about so maybe instead of coming in with agenda to convert you should come in with an agenda
to listen listen and learn and see where you might be wrong i mean uh ryan we're talking the other
day in the car and i said i like once once upon a time would have all different perception of all
of this stuff right as a christian um but i thought that that sex workers or sex work period should
become legalized and i even encourage if the government wants to if it's going from illegal
make it legalized and have it be taxable controlled safe we're an environment where people are able
to be tested um so you know that there's no stds regularly there's a way in which you can protect
the women like all of that rather than having people go pick someone up on the side of the street
corner doing god knows what trying to you know there's so much and you see the same example it
almost sounds contradictory about drugs when we there are nations who've legalized certain drugs
instead of criminalizing it they have found ways to use it to help the addict to get off so i kind
of use this as an analogy but i imagine the same can be done for sex work what are your thoughts of
someone in the industry about this whole issue yeah there is a big movement of foot right now in the
sex work industry that we're not trying to get legalized trying to get decriminalized okay because
when you get illegalized it gets the government too involved too controlled and it it makes people
like undocumented immigrants like put some more at risk so like we actually don't want to be legalized
we want to be decriminalized no one should be punished for consensual activities it's really
backwards the thing about this adult and this adult have consented why is why is it being
criminalized so it doesn't make any sense like this isn't involving a minor this isn't involving
doing harm like this is what two consenting adults have agreed to and so we're trying to get it
decriminalized so that there we do have more freedom especially people who do it in person who do it
on the streets or in the clubs right they do the work in person they are safe so if someone
does harm them they can actually go to the cops and report it and not be punished and not be
criminalized because it's been decriminalized but the person who's doing the harming they're the ones
who are who will face the punishment because they're they've broken the consent they've broken the
contract they've broken the agreement agreement but right now because it is criminalized we can't go
to anyone for help right and in fact when when there's a big sting who's busted not the pimps
the women so we even when we try to fix it we actually harm the ones who need the help and
we free the ones who are doing the harm like the addict who gets arrested with the drug and the the
big kilo dealer isn't caught but you know they want them to rat on them but then they also have that
leverage on their family their place they're living their whole night so yeah the addict suffers yeah
the war on drugs literally causes the addict more more problems than it does any solution to the
whole problem yeah it's like we have it all backwards and that's why again like it starts
with every single one of us that's why I'm so glad you guys are who's this conversation because I
always tell people I'd rather you lean in to learn and to listen than to pull back out of judgment
and change because this pullback reaction even though it's like it's just a pullback that's what
people in office and empower are doing they pull back out of judgment shame and fear let's create
laws that punish instead if their first reaction is we wait but look I want to I want to hear this
person's story I want to hear their truth what got them into this what oh oh this is totally not what
I was told oh my god we need to rework this whole law of your boss like that lean in to listen would
change everything and if we want to change the law it starts with us in our everyday lives are we
willing to lean into and listen rather than pull back in judge wow okay couple here each a pod my
buddy's in the house I really appreciate you for the super chat my friend go subscribe to his youtube
channel porn was inevitable our consciousness plus empathy allow us to put ourselves in other shoes
vicariously causing or experiencing their pleasure pushing them to be or start pushing them or
being pushed to their limits thanks I love that okay so this is another great thing about porn
this is great about anything right like when I watch certain porn which is funny I create it but
I don't watch much of it so there's there's stuff like that we don't talk about I never really watch
porn until I start making I just love making it I love filming myself I love gifting into the world
and then if I do watch any porn it's simply my own like you don't we don't talk about that either
anyway but when I do watch porn on occasion I like watching porn that pushes my limits I'm like
ooh is that something I'm interested in doing and then I'm always curious how much of my fantasy
this fantasy is this just a fantasy I want to keep as a fantasy and never fulfill my reality
and which of my fantasies do I actually want to experience in reality we don't talk about that either
there's a difference between our we have different fantasies and so when we can watch porn it actually
gives us clarity like oh my god I remember thinking two years ago I have to have a threesome before I die
I will not live my entire life without a threesome that is ridiculous and then I'll watch like a gang
bang I'm like hmm there's something about that that turns me on I think I might want to experience
that but I think I'd be okay going my whole life without fulfilling that one it helps us just learn
our desires or me communicating to my partner or to like hey can we try this hey can we try that
oh I'm not open to that like it fosters a conversation that leads to more awareness of what we want and
what we don't don't want how is that not a good thing I think it's I mean the very opening porn
was inevitable right uh going back to the bible right we we have clear stories I mean the bible
not gang games okay there's so much yes I mean there actually kind of is gang bang but it's not a
good thing it's actually yeah it's actually a bad thing what happens in judges to the one prostitute
outside of the house like there's some horrific stuff in the bible but there's also like the story
of Judah in Genesis that goes he's trying to get his son's wife and that keeps remarrying new sons
one spills a seed on the ground like and then finally she pretends and hides and sleeps with him
then he goes you're pregnant we're gonna burn her alive this the law which is ridiculous um come to
find out hey dude I've got your signet and staff that baby is yours and it's like what how is that
a model though like where you're at today if I because you're so free if I took that picture
said no what do you think about this kind of being some sort of standard on how we should be
what would you say to a story like that yeah you know my first thought is that woman who did that
I'm like you're a badass you had to do you had to do what you had to do to fucking survive in a
very fucked up world wow like when I look back now I now I read I mean I don't really read scripture
but when I think of scripture I now interpret it through a very sexual lens even that I think is
it Rahab who hides the two men under her skirt to protect them I'm like that bitch had a fucking
threesome and she loved it like she like that's my story now like hiding them yeah hiding them
oh we like these men go back oh we hid under her skirt it's like no you're ass like but anyways I
read it from a very sexual lens but I think for women back then where your entire livelihood
and this was still true until very recently in modern society where a woman's entire livelihood
was completely dependent upon a man and if a man died and if someone did not take her on
she was screwed she would have to become a prostitute or homeless and starve to death
that's not for a powerful woman who values life you'll do whatever you have to do to survive
so she did what she had to do to survive because she knew they would not look out for her she had
to take matters into her own hands to fucking make it and that's her right to make it it's
shame on the men in society that created a world where she could not make it on her own
and that she literally had to incubate someone else's life for her life to matter
and that is still we see that today where the incubated life is more important than the person
incubating it that's a problem so we can't look back at scripture and say well that's when all
the problem was we have it so good today we still have so many of the same issues or even for me
when I got this house this is my newest biggest nicest house I've had yet this shit the agent gave
me for how much money I make because he looked at my income the past three years he's seen how
much more I make each year if that was a dude he'd be like bro you are crushing it you are killing it
what's your secret because I'm a woman that's suspicious I bet that's not gonna last I don't
know if you can handle this house do you really think you're gonna afford this house because look
at your even though my income is so much higher than where I pay he's they said that to you yes I
so many misogynistic comments from this agent this male agent as a woman and he did everything in
his power to make sure I did not get this house the only reason I got this house is I way overpaid
it I said you can put any price on it this house is mine and I don't care what you charge I will
win in the end and I outbid every single person in this house and I'm paid I pay way too much
but I refuse to lose because I won't play your game and I will win like but that's in 20
22 where I have to fight for a a roof over my head because I don't have a man's voucher
man he kept asking for a man went do you have a man can I talk to him I'm like this is my house
my money my move it has nothing to do with me he could not grasp but then he'd be like why would
a woman want this many bedrooms this doesn't make sense and I'm like your have you ever said that to
a guy have you ever like the misogyny we face today is still just as real as but by all times but
thankfully I have the means to take care of myself where I don't have to go fuck someone
else and have their kid to stay alive right there are some people who do though you see what I mean
and that's the scary thing you have to do you have to do and like that's why I live such a judgment
free life because I understand that so many people especially if you're from a marginalized community
you have to do what you have to do to survive who am I to judge that when you're born into a
broken world and into broken systems and then you blame and shame the person who's just trying to make
it versus fixing the broken systems so no one has to make a decision that they don't want to do or
I'll even go step further because some people try to renegotiate reinterpret the bible why don't we
start like not believing in this book and start changing and coming up with our own kind of like
you were told what to believe and who to be but you found you and I'm finding me and she's finding
her and the point is is we've been told from ancient standards and tradition but we know these
aren't good oftentimes I'm not saying there aren't lessons and there aren't good things we can find
we can do that with any scripture Buddhist literature you name it the point is is like
why aren't we starting fresh and knowing what's less harmful what is the what is the best
decision scientifically I mean like there's all sorts of things that come in but I'm sorry that
you had to put up with that I really really hate that for you and my wife has had to deal with a
lot of things herself you know and she's a little shocked this is like one of the few times she's
been on air but she's a little shocked at how I am like always vocalizing on trying to help women
or speak up and say hey let's listen to what women have to say on this issue things like that
because I never was like that I wasn't I was born into a house with a military father he was a green
beret so he wasn't just any army guy he was the elite he told me how he became a ranger he was
running back in football in college and then saw this commercial on tv you want to be the
baddest ass of all you know that kind of thing and he went in and that was my lifestyle and it was
gay is bad smoking p smoking pots for losers and you know like those it's just this really intense
life he was alcoholic too so it adds a whole different dimension of intensity in my life
and finally to come out and start realizing oh my gosh I've been looking at shadows on the wall
and thinking that was reality and not listening to anyone else and I finally started listening so
that's my little ted talk I guess is to have people start listening
yeah and like thank you for that and like it just shows like we all have the capacity for
massive change and it's not easy because we are all raised in very specific contexts and it is
really scary to break out of that context when it's all you've known but I think for what you guys
have found and for what I have found like breaking out of it to find what is the context that we
want I want my context to be one of love I want mine to be context of inclusion I want to be
mind the context of compassion and so if I was raised in the context of judgment and fear and
punishment then like like you said it's our it's our responsibility to break out of it and create
a new context not just for your life but especially if you're going to have children or if you have
children like we want a different context for our babies because it's going to shape who they become
which is going to shape the kind of parents they become and that's the thing like people can on
the outside can criticize me but I know that I am doing some of the holiest work I've ever done
because I have been willing to question everything and come to conclusions that are rooted and grounded
in love for a better future for not just me but for my babies and for their futures this is work
that a lot of Christians won't even face because they are so convinced they are right on everything
they don't examine anything and I'm the opposite I'd rather examine everything in case I'm wrong
about something and so I can do better I love that that should someone clip that that's a phrase
there you gotta put put Nicole's name there make sure she gets credit six this thank you for the
super chat I really appreciate it I didn't see a comment I hope I didn't miss it inquisitive
mind happy birthday Ryan from the ghost of myth vision well thank you thank you yeah actually
St. Patrick's Day but thank you yay that's awesome I love birthdays well I do have a question so I
noticed that you talk about SIGs can you explain what like what that is and about sex like S-E-G-G-S
yes is that what you said oh yeah so I censor it just for social media but is there actual
place that you go like a lifestyle club that you are referring to yeah so when I so far I only
do it out of state because I'm like I'm pretty protective of my local area and like don't want
to bump into like my friend my kid's friend's parents I don't know it'd probably be cool but like
just right now because sex cubs are new to me I've just been to one in Vegas and one in Florida
and they have been incredible experiences I highly recommend them and like it just shows like
my nature I'm a very curious person and I used to fear my curiosities but I found that
my curiosities often lead to courage to go after the life of my dreams so I now honor my
curiosity I'm like what do you do at sex clubs so the first one I did a lot of watching and then
I had sex with my date um and then on the second one I did a lot I was a way more active involved
and did stuff with other people there and it was an amazing experience and it's every time I do
something like this I'm like everyone needs to do this everyone needs to go to sex club
everyone needs to hire an escort everyone to try making their own porn like I just love all of it
and I find it's nowhere near as big as what we need it out to be and I walk away so happy I tried the
thing wow do you have any other questions no I really appreciate um you coming on I know that
there's going to be people in the chat who also appreciate it as well for those who don't I don't
care um I hope that they can learn from this though I really don't open-minded yeah be open-minded
maybe they're where I was five ten years ago and I would have told myself I don't care either so
don't worry I'm talking to myself here um we do have one more super chat here and then I do want
to do a shout out plug for you maybe you can tell us some things you have coming up this was your
life old testament law allowed Israelites to take female prisoners of war an apologist will say
that was better than the alternative like that sounds like OF would have been a better option
wonder if uh only fans oh okay yeah yeah that's a good point I didn't know I didn't know uh wonder
if god would support would support only fans then yes I love this question because this really
highlights the point like how convenient it is for male apologists let's be clear here right because
theology and the religious rules dominated predominantly by men and typically white men
power how convenient is it to be like oh yes I mean it was better for this woman to be raped and
made a slave than to die on her own like we were actually looking out for her like this was for her
well-being like what a convenient excuse to do whatever the fuck you want to another person it
makes me mad because the same thing was set of slavery in America like at least we're introducing
them to god and Jesus at least for taking care of them because without us they would be ruined
they were living their own fine lives before you came in and raped and pillaged their land and people
like for women back then I do agree in the sense that yeah the entire system was set up to make
sure women didn't make it and that the only way for women to make it is by raping and marrying
and impregnating them and do whatever the fuck you want to them that also is not a viable option
how is that better than death what if death was the better option and then thirdly if that's really
how the system was set up why the fuck did you not make a better system this instead of making an
entire group of gender your concubines that's really the best plan you can come up with that's
really your plan to say we were actually looking out for her I refuse to believe that and I used to
I used to say what you said here I used to think well at least they had an option no
raping and being locked up as a slave is not an option like that is such a poor excuse for
provision and yet we see we still see fragments of that today we're like me not knowing I have
consent to my own marriage that is not never okay do not tell me that that was okay because
well you agreed to marry him he agreed to marry no that is not okay how is it possible to be a
woman of this modern world and I not know what consent is because misogyny still runs the the
world right misogyny wins at the end of the day and so I'm so passionate about helping women
helping men helping all genders reflect on is this the life I want to live does this serve me
does this serve other people is this really the best plan I can come up with or is there
something better here and so only fans has been so amazing because it gives power to the average
person I don't need a big porn guru director to choose me I choose me I don't have to wait and
hope someone hires me I hire me I don't wait until someone will someday pay me I tell people what to
pay me like only fans is giving me agency and control in a way that no other platform could
have before this moment and so yeah like we've got to do better as humans to think of better
solutions than saying be my concubine because that's the best we got you no we need to do
better than that hallelujah I mean seriously though you're you're hitting so many nails on the
head I'm gonna have to have you back here as a guest and I hope that people get inspired by this
and start flowering themselves I really appreciate that chat GPT says for the quality for all humans
of all genders now amen chat GPT we're not asking for too much here this is the thing we act like
break the call yes like why is this such a radical concept when this is a basic concept
foundational concept we have got to stop acting like this is some big deal this is we're asking
for breadcrumbs here this is not that big of a deal we've got to stop acting like it's a big deal
and it should not be this hard to fight in legislature for laws to be passed for all genders
to be protected it just it is mind-boggling to me that we're still having this conversation
that's been going on for millennia when we could be so much further along if we would just let it
I have one more statement I'd love to get your comment before I do another plug for you and
you tell us what's going on if you don't mind that is the way the world has viewed sex workers
prostitution whatever as like they would look at that as the lowest of the low in terms of society
of where people can go what I find amazing about your story is you have made this occupation
one of the most powerful things a woman can have in your world I can't say for all but
your story tells me that you're taking this and you own it there's nobody who owns you
you own you and you have full control over it which is impressive that you took something that
category wise society wise men look and go oh oh slut this that the worst derogatory statements
toward you but you're a queen and you're ruling a throne there's no king next to you telling you
how to run your throne you run it like the queen of England but not literally but you know what I'm
saying like yeah I that's what I find impressive and I think like it's so interesting because really
I bring out the best and worst men in a sense that like men will either like slut shame me
or like I've always wanted being someone like that I've always wanted to date someone like that
and yet then I'm still called the problem when I'm just simply being me doing me loving me
living me there's this complete alignment and freedom and peace there but I'm the one who has
the problem and so it's just like I am so grateful for this empire that I am building this kingdom
that I do rule and it's ruled from love and it's ruled from authenticity and integrity and grace and
and wholeness and hotness right it's the whole package and it is my hope that people listening
or people watching me watching walk away with the same permission be you boo if you're a slut be a
slut if you're a prude be a prude like be the truest version of you there is space for you here
you don't have to be more of one thing to be loved and accepted in a whole you are loved and
accepted in a whole so if you are already loved accepted in a whole what the fuck do you want to
be what do you want to do with your life what like I want to get somewhere I get the end of my life
and I look back on it and be like girl I went all in and it was so good and it was so juicy and it
was so yummy I am so proud of myself I want that for every person so what what do you want to look
back and see at the end of your life that you're so proud you did you had the courage to do you
lived your truthiest truth and set everyone else free in the process go for that do that yeah
wow well this is amazing you have anything coming up that you'd like to share like let people know
I mean how can people support you what what is what do you recommend yeah I mean check out my world
like if you want to check out my only hands I have a lot of women subscribe I have a lot of
couples subscribe a lot just out of curiosity like what is it like in a space I have an amazing
