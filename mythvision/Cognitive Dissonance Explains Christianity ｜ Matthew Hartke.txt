Cognitive dissonance theory and the origins of Christianity today, we're actually going
to tackle this subject and hopefully if you're listening and your ears are open and you're
actually trying to consider the data that is set before you, you might walk away thinking,
wow, I actually do have a better grasp of what I think is going on in the origins of what
we call Christianity, which wasn't a whole altogether new religion. Rather, it was Jewish
religion and then there was a splintering off at some point in the early church. But today,
I'm going to be introducing a new guest and we're going to be discussing cognitive dissonance theory.
Until then, let's get ready for the end of time because myth vision is bringing it.
Now, I know it is popular belief that only Christ is worthy of, if you will,
removing the sills off of the scroll, but myth vision, myth vision truly is the one who's worthy
and never forget, we are myth vision. Today, I have Matthew Hartke and if I may, as I say,
you'll have, I'm going to show your YouTube channel. People need to go subscribe. What is
cognitive dissonance theory and who is Matthew Hartke? Oh man, well, I'll start with myself first.
Yeah, my name is Matthew Hartke and I am just an independent guy who has absolutely no expertise
in the subjects that I'm interested in. I mean, I have a bachelor's in biblical studies from
Regent University, so not a lot to say there except just that I am endlessly fascinated with
the origins of Christianity, the historical Jesus and that fascination started as a Christian
and I was actually part of an apocalyptic movement that believed that we are actually
for real living in the last generation. Jesus is coming back extremely soon and part of my
interest in cognitive dissonance theory started from that place where I was in this community.
We had this whole story, this prophetic history that we were the chosen people of God living in
the end times. We were forerunners called to prepare the way of the Lord just like John the
Baptist prepared the way for Jesus first coming. We were preparing the way for his second coming
and the longer I was there, the more I started to realize like, hey, the way that we tell the
stories of our prophetic history now are a little bit different from the way that they were told 10
years ago, 20 years ago and I actually started getting into this guy, N.T. Wright started getting
a little bit more into the scholarly study of the Bible instead of just a little apocalyptic
niche that I was a part of. As a Christian. As a Christian and my introduction to cognitive
dissonance theory actually came from this book, N.T. Wright's big book on the resurrection,
the Resurrection Son of God. It's like 600 pages in. He is trying to establish the
historicity of the resurrection and I was of course at the time just blown away by his argument
and completely bought into it but then he starts to deal with other possible alternative explanations
for the resurrection and the first one that he deals with is cognitive dissonance theory and of
course he spends a couple pages on it and casts it to the side thinks you know that's it don't
need to talk about that anymore but I saw that and as someone who came from this apocalyptic movement
I was like whoa okay it actually hit me and talking about the way that movements who
believe that the end is coming in their generation when that doesn't happen how they
rationalize those failed expectations and how they try to hold on to the core of their faith
while reinterpreting those early expectations to fit with the unexpected course of history I was
like okay that makes me uncomfortable and I saw how it explained the little you know fringe Christian
movement that I was a part of and I had to leave that but then about 10 years goes by and I spend
about 10 years trying just with my nails clenched trying my best to hold on to my faith and not
see that explanation go all the way to explaining the origins of Christianity
but ultimately I came to the place where I said you know what I have to be honest with this evidence
and I was doing my best to do the mental gymnastics doing my best to rationalize it all and
had a lot of help from NTRite in that for a long time but ultimately came to the conclusion that
I think Jesus was a failed apocalyptic prophet I think he was expecting the kingdom of God to come
in that generation I think his believers his followers thought that he was the Messiah and
he was going to usher in that kingdom and then he died unexpectedly and they had to do something
about that either abandon this movement that they had given up everything to follow or find a creative
way to hold on to their faith while while taking on board these new facts of their experience in
the death of Jesus and I think that that explains I don't think that there's any like one size fits
all theory of everything that explains the whole of any religious movement but if there was I think
cognitive dissonance has a real shot at being that big explanation it explains so much about
how Christianity came from Judaism and the ways that it changed from its Jewish apocalyptic roots
and became a new original movement so yeah I'm excited to dig into it I can't wait yeah this
is going to be good for those who are watching he's used cognitive dissonance a couple times
and just to give you the google definition here that I look up cognitive dissonance theory it says
cognitive dissonance theory postulates that an underlying psychological tension a tension is
created when an individual's behavior is inconsistent with his or her thoughts and beliefs this
underlying tension then motivates an individual to make an attitude change that would produce
consistency between thoughts and behaviors beliefs if you will in practices and I think that's a very
important part to start off with because our good friend especially I don't know I suspect you've
emailed Del Alice in January before maybe maybe not but I've had a couple times we've hung out
he's my hero but he's awesome and I've got a whole course that we are about to launch I mean in
the next few days I'm waiting on Neil Gnostic conformant to finish editing part eight that course
is going to get launched it's called the the um the quest for the historical Jesus and what it's
about isn't proving historicity has nothing to do with the mythicist historicist argument
he simply shows the history from the Protestant Reformation onward how Christian academic scholars
and critical thinkers within the Christian bubble start to question first of all the the claims of
the Catholic church and the saints did this and that they're like hold on there's contradictions
they started to actually as Roman Catholics pick apart their faith in terms of some of the claims
within their bubble to try and clean up house so to speak right and then eventually they were
consistent with that scalpel and started cutting into did Jesus really do that because that contradicts
this they started to see the problems with their own text and he goes through and there's a famous
man your your ears will tingle when I say Albert Schweitzer okay who comes on the scene and he's
a Christian this guy died a Christian for people who are look at the guy on the wall right there
that's Albert sweat I did not expect you to do I did wow so Albert Schweitzer plays a significant
role in what he did just to give people important details is he then said we need to place this
Jewish teacher this Jewish person in his Jewish context and Jewish apocalyptic thinking among
other Jewish apocalyptic groups so pretty much what he's saying is what did the Jews believe
let's put Christianity on the side for a second what did Jews you know kumran you name it whatever
right like obviously they didn't have Dead Sea Scrolls when he was writing but he had enough
data to know hey maybe they did discover them around I don't know when he died but a little bit
after that but he he did further work after that that included that yeah see the point and you get
the point is like what were Jews teaching and he recognized they and you see this in your New Testament
hinted at they thought that a real ushering in of God's kingdom legitimately overthrowing the
pagan nations that were ruling the Jews were going to come in and he was going to set things right
literally here on earth this is what Jews believed and even the disciples themselves in the gospels
believed that this is why they did not understand Jesus and we're going to get into this
um so I think I'm already giving too many uh Easter eggs in the beginning here Matt
oh man let's make it a conversation and like that's exactly right but I mean I think that that's the
the important starting point um is to ask the question what did you know mainstream Jewish
eschatological expectation what were they expecting what did the kingdom of God mean
and I think the the big place to go for that is probably Daniel first of all but you have like
Daniel 2 the vision of this statue and then the the rock comes and destroys the statue and it
becomes a great mountain and takes over the whole world and that rock is the kingdom of God but
and then in Daniel 7 you have the vision of the four beast empires and then the the Son of Man comes
and authority is given to him over the whole earth and I mean it's these these things are what
Jews in the first century would be reading would be hearing and when they talked about the coming
of the kingdom of God that's what they meant they meant something tangible something concrete
something climactic that would actually answer the long-standing problem of evil that monotheism
had had to grapple with for for generations the question of if God is good why are we suffering
if God is good why are we the tail and not the head we are his chosen people and yet we're being
led around like cattle and these pagan nations these evil nations are ruling over us what gives
and eschatology in general I think the best explanation the best uh definition of eschatology
is that every eschatology whatever it is there's a lot of different kinds of eschatology but monotheistic
eschatology is a response to the problem of evil and it translates the problem of evil into the
problem of delay it says well the ultimate answer to all of the evil that we see in the world
is going to come when God returns when he makes all things right when he
vindicates his people and he judges their oppressors and you know maybe redeems them there's
different different eschatology some some have more of a positive emphasis where he's going to
redeem all of the evil people and others have more negative ones where it's no he's going to judge
all of the wicked but either way the point is is that in the end God wins but what that does is
that it just translates the problem of evil into the problem of delay because then you have the
question how long oh lord when will you return when will you do this I mean it's Habakkuk is the
classic example of this um and Habakkuk I think in a lot of ways prepares the way for the Jewish
apocalypticism that became so dominant in the first century that had such a controlling uh uh you
know such a control over the way the character of early Christianity but the main thing is is that
they a real eschatology had to answer that problem it had to actually get down to the problem of
evil and give an answer to the hard realities of our experience and the way that that experience
seems to be in conflict with this primary core belief that we have that God is good
that we are his chosen people and that he has a good plan for us and he has a good plan for the
earth um and and so that in itself creates a cognitive dissonance that that Judaism in
the generations in the centuries before Christianity had to grapple with had to had to develop responses
to and Christianity ultimately is one particular brand of Jewish response to the problem of evil
that that breaks off and as you said at the at the intro turns it into a completely different
worldview ultimately um but yeah yeah and in there in wow does that run off and become a
it takes on a life of its own is the best way I could put it uh which is why you see so many
splinter offs of strange things what we would call categorized Gnosticism and stuff like that you go
whoa like it it has a life of its own so um getting back to the point you make that is so
well put I love the problem of evil I love that the expectation they're thinking something for
real is supposed to happen and um I put in my notes here you know what did the Jews expect we
talk about John Jay Collins here on myth vision a lot I'm a huge huge fan of him I don't know
he is the goat and his it's gotta be the accent it's gotta be the gosh um but Collins is a friend
of mine and I've learned so much from him and I actually was there the week he retired and got
like half the books on my bookshelf are his I have some that are out of print I had to rub it
in your face you know this is just what I have you're gonna you don't live too far you're gonna
come over here at some point um but Collins has in his apocalyptic imagination book he has very
few images in there but they're there and there's one chart that has all of these like second temple
Jewish literature and he explains and puts like dots where into the world expectation or in all
of them check off dots of real in this world legit changes that were expected by Jewish thinking
now not all the dots check off on all the literature but there is this expectation
actually something's gotta happen and so this is why I think Christians still hold on to
something's gotta happen even though the cognitive dissonance of when it was supposed to and how it's
supposed to as a whole Christians can't make their mind up they're confused and this is a very
important issue that led me on a path to exiting I hope Christians take notes today I hope they
consider what I'm saying and at least be fair in seeing why I see this problem and maybe they will
see it and they have something I don't know and knowing how to reconcile this issue um before
we continue to the next question I want to give a shout out to the members Akmal Sela thank you
for joining I hope I pronounced that properly I really appreciate you being a member and then
Panos I'm not gonna butcher your last name I'm just too nice I don't want to do that to you
thank you for joining me fission's membership program and I'll get to your super chats here
let's let those accumulate a little and we'll come back to them it seems like you were ready to take
a note or you might you didn't want to forget something there Matt so did you want to add
something to this oh no no no I'm just I'm preparing because uh I've got if I can recommend one book
on cognitive dissonance and its relevance to failed apocalyptic movements it would be this one
and it is a collection of uh studies the most influential studies in cognitive dissonance and
failed prophetic expectations the book is called expecting Armageddon essential readings and failed
prophecy but I'm just saving a place in it for later because uh yeah I something something made
you go ooh ooh I gotta come back to that okay cool we're gonna get to that the next question is did
the cognitive dissonance theory interpretation actually create a new religion so to speak in
Christianity um do we want to move that question to a different spot and maybe start with other
movements or what what how do you want to approach this conversation I think I think we can yeah I
think we can start there I think that for me one of the and I just I just made a video
on this subject uh but the like the way that I approach this issue is looking at the ways that
Christianity diverges from its Jewish apocalyptic roots and asking the question how do we explain
those divergences why and and those I mean that's the stuff of history is is when you have a religious
movement that breaks off from another religious movement you gotta ask the question you know
what explains this strange and surprising feature why did they come to change their beliefs in this
way and one of the most surprising and unexpected changes that that uh they're early and when we
read the New Testament the ways that it diverges from contemporary Jewish understandings of the
kingdom of God is that it the it talks about the kingdom of God as if it is in some sense already
present as if it's some in some sense already established the kingdom of God has come and
that is really weird it's a really weird thing for a first century Jew to say um and so you gotta
ask the question why why did it do that and um that I think is I mean it's something that
um in reading the work of NT Wright his big Christian origins in the question of God series
that is an underlying question that he tries to answer in that series um his his the second
work in that series um is his big book on the historical Jesus it's called Jesus and the victory
of God but at the very beginning of that book he asks the question and he says you know would any
serious thinking first century Jew really claim that the promises of Isaiah 40s uh Isaiah 40 to
66 or the the promises of Ezekiel or Zachariah or Jeremiah the new covenant the end of exile would
what any serious thinking first century Jew actually believed that those things had already
been fulfilled and the answer the implicit answer is no of course not no serious thinking Jew would
think that and yet that is what the earliest Christians were claiming they were claiming that
those prophetic promises had come to pass in an already but not yet way they had been partially
fulfilled still waiting full full climactic fulfillment at the end of the age but they had been
that there had been a down payment how do you explain that that's really weird and this is what
I was saving in this book I'll read it now but I first found this book in a local theological
library here and I just one of those serendipitous things where you're just reading and you just
come across something that is you know not not not something that you would find in an algorithm
online because it's not your typical reading and I was like oh well you know I'll pick that up and
look at it and I turned to this page and read this paragraph and it blew me away this is from
Jay Gordon Melton and the uh the the title of the the article here the study is spiritualization
and reaffirmation what really happens when prophecy fails and he says this he says whenever a
prophecy fails groups and groups consistently engage in one activity they reconceptualize
the prophecy in such a way that the element of failure particularly the failure of the divine
to perform as promised is removed while a group may temporarily assume an error in timing the
ultimate and more permanent reconceptualization is most frequently accomplished through a process
of spiritualization the prophesied event is reinterpreted in such a way that what was supposed
to have been a visible verifiable occurrence is seen to have been in reality an invisible
spiritual occurrence the event occurred as predicted only on a spiritual level
I first read that probably about eight years ago and it I was a Christian at the time
and it sat really uneasily with me because I thought that that sounds eerily
similar to what the New Testament says about the kingdom of God the way that the New Testament
writers talk about the kingdom as being already established in a mostly in a mostly spiritual
way as the the the New Covenant and I mean this is something where like the way that the New
Testament writers pull on Old Testament prophetic expectations the way that they pull on apocalyptic
expectations but they kind of they take a razor to those expectations and kind of the way that I
describe it is cutting the eschatological cake they kind of cut out a small piece of those
expectations and it and it just so happens to be the parts of those expectations that were
inward the parts of those expectations that were spiritual the parts of those expectations
that were heavenly and they say those have been fulfilled and then they project all of the more
concrete all of the more substantial all the more ultimate and climactic answers to the
problem of evil they project those into the unfulfilled future but so you have things like
Jeremiah's Jeremiah 31 the New Covenant prophecy that prophecy if you read Jeremiah 31
you know it's all I'll put a I'll put my law within you I will forgive your sins you know no
longer will people have to teach one another because the law will be in their hearts but that
that little little bit of that chapter that is used over and over again in the New Testament
Paul talks about the New Covenant the writer of Hebrews talks about the New Covenant
you read the surrounding context and it's about the earthly tangible concrete restoration of
Israel about the cities being rebuilt about people being the land being populated with
new generations of people and them no longer having to worry about foreign invasion pagan nations
them being established and having everlasting peace and harmony on earth and the way that
the New Testament polls the New Covenant the little in the inward spiritual part of that
prophecy that for Jeremiah was supposed to accompany this much larger much more climactic
much more earthly expectation and they pull the spiritual part of that out and say yeah that's
been fulfilled in Jesus's death and resurrection that has been fulfilled that's the way that the
New Testament deals with Old Testament prophecy and deals with apocalyptic expectation over and
over and over and over again yeah and and so when you when you like read the New Testament then you
read these studies I mean just group after group after group that throughout history has expected
something tangible something earthly to happen in the very near future and then that thing doesn't
happen the way that they deal with that time and time again by spiritualizing it and saying oh no
no it did happen just in a spiritual way we misunderstood it previously we thought that it
was going to be earthly and that it was going to be you know the the the full thing but it's just
it's this down payment and that down payment that partial fulfillment confirms our larger world view
and and it says we have this guarantee we have this guarantee of our future hope because
Christ is risen and he's now exalted to the right hand of God where in heaven he's ascended to heaven
so he's he's not here you can't like the the full manifestation of his kingdom hasn't actually
become visible on earth yet but he's reigning he's reigning in heaven and it's coming yeah it's
coming and it's coming and and that's that's what happens you split the expectation into two
different parts you project this the most substantial the most significant the most important parts of
that expectation in the future and then the things that are unfalsifiable you you you say that those
are presently fulfilled and it's a way to protect faith but yeah there are so many good things that
you just said that I think are important for people to understand and we see this change or at
least hints of this stuff going on in the New Testament with what you're describing here you
mentioned earlier the earliest Christians and I wish we had their writings to see what they said
right because I don't know exactly what they exactly thought but if we glean Paul we glean
into the gospels and imagine that they might be reflecting something like Marx our earliest gospel
and I call them it's my term like the just dim-witted disciples right they don't get it
they don't get it they never knew they never Jesus is being so clear he's being so obvious
I'm gonna die I'm gonna rise again you guys are expecting something earthly to happen right now
but no that's not one of us can sit at your right hand in the kingdom and it's like he's like
you're not getting it what my favorite example of that my favorite example of that is in John
2 where Jesus says you know destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up and of course he
says temple and and everyone around him is like what this temple is taking years to build you're
gonna just destroy it and then raise up in three days and then and then John says you know the
disciples remembered later they remembered that Jesus had said this and that it was actually
about the temple of his body right and how he would die and rise again and that's an example of
the cognitive dissonance you're talking about it's like really what he meant really what it said
because they're so vested and they're so deeply entrenched within the movement they're they have
no other way cognitively speaking this is why you keep mentioning cognitive dissonance so they find
a way to wrestle with what the reality happened to their expectations and and what their interpretations
of the reality must have been that's that struggle so um one little comment about the kumran sect
and I wish I had John Jay Collins book up I had a little thumbnail I made a while ago I wish I could
have shown it and gave people the actual source but they used Daniel and the 49 weeks of years
and stuff to predict that it was going to happen within their time second century bc first century
bc it didn't happen the movement didn't stop they did not stop believing in the off way they did not
quit their practices they just kept going and they probably had to redefine things or at least
reset the clock to find out when it was supposed to happen will you go into the millerites for us a
little giving an example or any other apocalyptic groups that are expecting an end that have an
eschatology um and what happens with those movements yeah well first of all just to
comment on the kumran sect because that's really fascinating and Collins his work I mean it's uh
in several different works of his on the Dead Sea Scrolls I can't recommend his work on that
more highly but um I think I'm trying to remember what the title of the book is but it's like apocalypticism
in the Dead Sea Scrolls um by Collins John Jay Collins uh and he talks uh in this one section
about the uh the commentary on their commentary on Habakkuk um and it's it's a fragment so we
don't have the whole thing but it deals with uh Habakkuk 2 which becomes a really important
passage for the New Testament and is also a very important passage for Daniel Daniel grapples with
Habakkuk um but uh it's this passage in Habakkuk where uh Habakkuk says you know he's he's grappling
with this problem with delay he's saying how long a lord and uh and he says that you know uh though
it though it delays it it has been appointed for a predetermined time and though it appears to delay
wait for it um and and so it's like it makes the the delay only an apparent delay from the human
perspective um where the the the time is set and and then the the the the kumran community
oh dude yeah Robert Carroll that's so dry but it's on point yeah yep um but their commentary on
Habakkuk they they say oh this was referring to our time and we are in this time where there's
this apparent delay and we're waiting um but it's gonna come and uh and so it's an interesting
example of that that when it's when it's not happening they rationalize it and say okay that's
just from the human perspective that we think um that it's not happening but it really is happening
and uh it's it's appointed in god's time and so just hold on a little bit longer and the
book of daniel does that too where daniel actually inspired by Habakkuk sets actual dates says it's
gonna happen in in in uh 1260 days and then it doesn't happen in 1260 days and so some scribe
comes along adds a clause he says oh so what bless yeah bless it as he waits to the end of the 1290
days and then and then just after that it says you know and those who come to the end of 1335
days yep it's funny you remember the numbers exactly yeah well because in the in the apocalyptic
movement that i came from all of those numbers meant something and they were about our generation
all of those numbers were about this time in the 20th 21st century about the restoration of israel
in in 1948 1967 and and you know we find a way to read all to reread to reinterpret all of those
prophecies so that they refer to our time and that's what these groups do again and again and again
is you you you reinterpret it so that it refers to your time and then when time stretches out and
i mean the the classic dispensationalist uh reading of daniel is that you know the the the prophetic
clock stopped in in uh when the just when the temple was destroyed in in uh 70 ad and and then it
restarted again in 1948 when uh or in 1967 and and so this is now the last generation um but now
it's okay well times time is getting on and they're having to rationalize that again like is this really
one generation since 1948 really um so that stuff isn't quite as popular as it used to be
and that i think is why you start to see more popular within evangelicalism is this perspective
from guys like mt right who emphasize less of the futurist response to eschatology and more of the
inaugurated eschatology more of the realized eschatology because just like uh j gordon melton
said the the more permanent response when the things don't happen is is not to reset the dates
and say well it's gonna come it's gonna come it's gonna come it's to say no no no it did happen
it did happen and it just happened spiritually and that leads right into talking about the the
millerites because um i mean this is a huge part of american history but uh after the second grade
awakening there was this this group of people who believed they were stirred up by all these
revival meetings and and they thought what's happened like something's got something big
has to be happening jesus has to be returning because you know he's pouring out his spirit
we're experiencing all these signs and wonders and visions and um and so there's this this
baptist preacher in the 1830s named william miller and he reads the book of daniel and he
thinks you know what these 1335 days these this must be years these days must be years
and so he does the calculations and says oh you know what this means it means that the end
of all things is going to come in 1844 and and so he masses this following throughout the 1830s
that think that the the the end of all things is going to come in 1844 and they eventually
you know do hone in their their calculations and decide oh it's it's gonna come on october 22nd
1844 they give up their property they take their kids out of school they stop planting their crops
for the harvest and and they're and they're mocked by their neighbors i mean some of them were
tarred and feathered there's violence breaking out against them people thought they were crazy
and all of that just made them more committed to their belief but but then then it comes and goes
october 22nd comes and goes it doesn't happen they're completely dejected but
what eventually happens one of the leaders of the movement he's processing this trying to he's
grieving what what happened why didn't this happen like am i is all of this a waste is all of my
christian experience for nothing like if this wasn't real then what is real is does god even exist
and in that turmoil in that acute experience of cognitive dissonance he has a vision
and in this vision jesus comes to him and tells him it it it wasn't in error it wasn't wrong
it did happen you were just wrong about exactly what it was that happened you misunderstood and
thought that the thing that was going to happen was going to be the ultimate earthly
consummation of all things but one of the key texts of the movement was this person
uh daniel 8 where daniel is talking about the the the cleansing of the sanctuary and jesus
and jesus reveals to this guy his name is hyra medsen reveals to him that the sanctuary that that
text is referring to isn't the earthly sanctuary because what does the new testament say the
earthly sanctuary is just a copy it's just a shadow of the sanctuary in heaven and so what
really happened on october 22nd is that jesus entered the heavenly sanctuary in preparation
for his return to the earth so lo and behold for those with eyes to see it actually did happen
the thing that they expected did happen they were wrong their human understanding was a little
off but jesus did fulfill his promise and this was the the the the the thing that caused the
if you've ever heard of the seventh day adventists this is their origin story this is how they became
their own sect their own denomination if you consider them a christian sect they that that is
how they formed um but so it's it that story is is very typical it's this same thing happens
again and again and again groups that are you know an apocalyptic flavor of a larger religious tradition
expect this thing to happen it doesn't happen and then they reinterpret the thing that didn't happen
in such a radical way to salvage their faith to protect their faith that they then look very
different from they did be from from the way that they look before and they're now a new movement
completely a new religious sect entirely um and so i think that explains christianity pretty well
and you said you know we we don't have if only we had the earliest you know if only we had the
stuff before paul um because paul is our earliest writer in the new testament and he was a convert
um so he wasn't actually there when all this stuff was happening um but the question this is why i
start with this question of okay what we have is all of these strange ways that early christian thought
in the form that we have it at the dates that we have it was different from
the jewish roots that it came from and how do we explain that difference and that's that's
that's the historical question and that's what i think cognitiveness and its answers better than
anything else if there's so many things you said that really get me thinking even the war the macabee
in war okay um people doubled down and even more like we're fighting even harder even to their death
as you see it described in the literature you see martyrdom taking place in early christianity and
their persecution complex it's even almost encouraged now theologically within it because
their own master died right so we need to mimic him i think sabat sabatize zevi i forget how you
pronounce it properly jewish sabatize zevi would be like the ang the anglican kind of pronunciation
it would be sabatize z would be the jewish pronunciation but i in that video i said sabatize
zevi yeah i i've heard it that way mainly but i i feel what you're saying i've heard he's a jewish
rabbi type figure and of course very you know seen as the messiah he ends up going to convert
a muslim leader and ends up getting subdued right like dude you're gonna freaking die all of a
sudden he's a convert and the jews think ah to get the messiah to come you have to like almost do
the most like the most wrong thing and that means following his footsteps and convert to muslim
to islam because it's not the truth and that way the more kind of i i guess maybe i'm using the wrong
words but i'm gonna say the more evil we produce it forces the messiah to come so now we need to act
crazy how the mind works redemption through sin yeah it's they they develop a whole theology
of redemption through sin and all of these jews end up converting at least outwardly and mass
to islam and to this day there is a sabati insect there is there is a sect of judaism
it's small but there are jews alive today i mean this was in 1666 that that sabatize zevi
converted to islam and uh and to this day there's a group of jewish sabati and believers who
believed that that sabatize zevi was and is still the messiah and that they they and it's it's
fascinating you read this stuff because they they read uh isaiah 53 the passage about the
suffering servant and they thought you know oh he is reviled he is despised by men he's
esteemed as nothing and it's that's that's exactly what has happened he he he went to the lowest
place the lowest place imaginable he actually appeared to convert he takes on sin i mean it's
very similar to like what what paul says in uh i think it's second carinthians uh 5 17 or around
there where he says you know christ took on he became sin they had very similar language talking
about how sabatize zevi became the most despised the most wicked outwardly inwardly it's a different
story right but and so they spiritualized it all and thought that this is actually the the the last
stage of the great tribulation this is what the messiah has to do in order to bring the kingdom
and and and so this is a fulfillment actually of our expectations not not a falsification of our
expectations and all they have to do is open their bible to find their their what they needed to keep
them going like yeah unreal wow okay so we got some super chats i i always try to show love and
thank you for being patient to everybody um we'll get to your super chats and then we'll bounce back
and forth because there's so much to discuss here and this was the topic that was the achilles hill
for me it literally was what did it i got x communicated from the presbyterian pca church
for teaching fulfilled eschatology i became a what they call full preterist i said these
people in these churches are ignoring jesus words jesus said he was coming back soon you call him a
liar you all you men believe not man believe god and his word this is what i thought i felt like
martin luther i cannot lie my conscious tells me scripture says here i stand i didn't go that far
of course they silenced me five elders in the presbyterian church silenced me and pretty much
rebuked me and told me you're teaching heresy and you need to stop it's potentially damnable i felt
so uncomfortable and felt like these men do not want to know what the truth is as a hardcore christian
when christians say you're never really a christian i just smile inside bro it's like
yeah yeah okay same whatever yeah man it was i was so so into it man i was willing to go to battle
i got so many christian friends online in the reform camp specifically that were telling me how
wrong i was how wicked how this bro they're just not reading their texts they're just not reading
what's being said here and they're able to somehow go right past it so there's my excitement now we
go into the super chats minder bender thank you for the super chat we know some very devout believers
who grapple with dissonance yet part ways with many of their deep seeded convictions why can some do this
yeah um i mean this is really interesting and it's something that actually uh for me is very
personal because i have had to do a lot of soul searching and ask myself like okay i obviously
changed my mind and i uh came to the the conclusion that the group that i was a part of which i was
extremely committed to i mean let me give you a little taste of the group that i was a part of
it's called the international house of prayer and it is uh on the outside it's a it's a non-denominational
charismatic evangelical ministry fairly mainstream you know a little bit weird but but you know
mainstream uh but really it is an apocalyptic sect that is i mean the foundation of the movement
is that jesus is returning and the way that they respond to that conviction that we're living in
the last generation is by night and day 24 seven 365 days a year praying and worshiping non-stop
this group they've been going since 1999 they haven't stopped i mean it's like you know a sunday
worship service think of that but with intercessory prayer added to the worship where you're praying
for jesus to come back to you know release justice throughout the world intercessory prayer
and worship night and day 24 seven all the time it literally hasn't stopped they've there's been a
guy playing a guitar or a girl playing the guitar playing the piano a worship team singers i was one
of these people who my i would go in shifts and i would spend six hours a day praying i would get
up at five a.m be in this prayer room by six a.m and spend from six a.m to noon every day praying
i would fast two days a week regularly we would go on uh uh every month we would have a three day
fast every few months we would have a 20 or a 40 day fast and we the whole time we'd be fasting we
wouldn't eat we'd be reading the book of revelation we'd be reading the book of daniel asking god for
revelation to show us fresh how you are going to fulfill your promises and i mean what happens when
you're depriving yourself of food and just reading the same thing over and over and over and over
again i read the book every week for years a crazy book at that i mean it's really like you're gonna
nuts but we would we would have visions we had visions we had crazy experiences and
the question is how could i have let that go and and the answer is that i still feel
a tremendous amount of dissonance over that because my family is still there some of some of
of my good friends are still there and i i live in this state of perpetual tension
but what happened is is that i didn't actually want to leave that was my whole life and i started
reading nt right i started reading this you know biblical scholarship that was a little bit outside
of their you know authorized reading list but um and started asking questions very similarly to you
with uh with full preterism and when i started asking those questions they said they shut it
down said no this is not okay and ultimately i got kicked out i i went wow you know kicking and
screaming i didn't want to leave and it was only after being kicked out having the thing that i was
committed to being taken away from me that then i was i i was reeling and i i think was then able
to look with fresh eyes and start listening to their their stories their prophetic history
reading the new testament a new way um that that then took me further down those questions
because i thought if you're not able to listen to this and i'm uh in myers-briggs terms i'm an
intp an introverted intuitive thinking perceiving but like the kind of guy who's just gonna i'm
gonna ask questions i'm gonna be trying to get to the bottom of stuff and i am under the illusion
that i'm not as connected to the communities that i'm connected to as i really am and then
i end up asking questions that are out of bounds and getting myself in trouble and that's what
happened um but i think the the key thing though in answering this question more directly is that
individuals can and do all sorts of things that that might buck the might be on you know if you
think of a bell curve might be on the the ends of that bell curve but what we're talking about
is group-wide responses um what is the what is the what is the average for the most committed
followers what is the what is the most likely response to these states and well while individuals
leave these groups the group maintains faith the group stays intact they find ways to survive just
like any organism does they even have a system and i love the way you're talking just like any
organism sorry i cut you off but it's like it's exciting to point out that you actually play in
to their cognitive dissonance in a way and their explanation for why you left
when i spoke at a conference and i'll get to the next super chat here just a second is like
i spoke at a conference at a church i was still a christian as a full preterist in new york i was
actually they invited me to come to give a speech about how we can be confident the new testament
in the bible teaches jesus had to come back then and he can't fail that you don't even have to test
that one because we already believed he can't jesus is the one right so you don't have to go and like
prove that he's the one in the sense of like how can i show that it's more like we already know he
can't lie so i'm gonna show you in the text why what he said had to happen because we already
know he can't lie and he's gotten the flesh so it was easy for me to just go into the text and say
all right if jesus says something it's gotta be true let me give you a lecture and i gave two
lectures that weekend and they saw the one that got published on youtube the church that
i got kicked out of and i got a formal email from the main pastor andy webb in the pca reform camp
and he said we did not excommunicate you because of your heresy or of full preterism we excommunicated
you for your absence because you stopped coming to church and it's like so i said okay maybe maybe
i didn't actually give the accurate exact reason that you excommunicated me from your community
your particular bubble but it was because of my exploration into full preterism and then the
examination being in a court it felt like a court with the five elders lined up and i am the one on
the other side and they're all looking at me and each taking a turn telling me not to speak once
they all had to tell me what they wanted to tell me and i was like like you can't tell me that it
wasn't full preterism that led to this because it was my journey of trying to explore what the truth
is as a christian yeah so christians be sure to thank yourselves for making non christians
i'm just saying it is the christian communities that actually cause people who to become non christians
in many ways and uh there's also the exploration of the person themselves trying to find out what
the truth is they're going to come across information like myth vision and what you've
done on your channel and stuff so yeah i just want to emphasize i know i know we got to get the other
chats but um just the the the way i mean that that worldview that i held and i think that that you
held in some ways like although our groups were different there's there's something so
intoxicating about this idea that that god has a perfect plan for everything
he's orchestrating it all to this predetermined inclusion where you know it's for the good of
those who love him and you are specially chosen and you have this part to play in history in god's
big grand story you are uniquely special in that and um you know the the the level of like
ego support that i had in that community was so intense it was the most intense drug you could
ever imagine and losing that i've had to go through so much therapy and you know and i still like the
dissonance that i feel of just living a normal existence and even when i was a christian coming
out from that losing my faith more broadly in christianity was really nothing compared to losing
that intense apocalyptic worldview because the i mean it is it's crazy that drug is so
intense um but i wouldn't if i could have found a way to i mean if i like
if things were different and if i had a different personality type obviously it is what it is but
like people told me not to be asking these questions and i now know like i life is hard
outside of those communities because they support you they support you 100 you have everything there
and you are so special there when you're there when you're in good graces walking in footsteps and
you do it yeah and you like me at the time could be completely uneducated have nothing going for
you in in man's eyes in the eyes of the world but there you're one of them the elite you're
one of the most important people in the universe and oh can i make one comment about what you're
saying here okay so there's a scholar i read i take the empty tomb as a legend um that's just
what seems to be but i like to play there's a lot going on yeah i play in the sandbox like you like
okay if there was an actual tomb in which he was buried there's a missing body what is the
explanation a serious scholar cannot remember his name delci allison jr mentions this in his
resurrection book he recently wrote last year year before last um that he postulated that the
disciples did steal the body the text says hey the accusation is the disciples stole the body now
we know christians always have an explanation to get around this or try to say oh no no no that's
the point like of course they didn't they wouldn't say that they didn't and his his explanation was
the community that they're in instead of going back to fishing and struggling to try and you know
make ends meet and have fish to make money and they're getting taxed as they exit the lake of
tiberias which was once the sea of galilee controlled by the you know the emperor himself
and they're not trying to go back to that they have a community that is self-sustaining they're
being fed they get paid they have money they feel like they're elitist they're so important
why would they leave that right i'm not saying i draw this conclusion but thinking like we got
to make sure this guy rose from the dead or disappear because in the ancient world if the
body was missing they became a god they went to the heavens so his position is not implausible
it's even more plausible to me than he really actually literally died for three literal days
and rose from the dead so any other postulated position that could make sense makes better
sense than that conclusion in my opinion and you made me think of that because i remember when i
was in the church my wife and i were struggling in our relationship we had the pastor come over
she worked at the dental office that's a whole another thing one of the elders that was rebuking
me was her boss it's a whole strange thing but but they came over and the pastor said how about this
you quit your dental works office because women are not supposed to work you quit it we'll sustain
your rent we'll pay for your bills till Derek can find the job he needs that can afford all of this
and they were gonna do this and my wife was gonna be a stay-at-home mother
that's how far they were involved when i missed two Sundays in a row which are the Sabbath in their
worldview it's not uh saturday it's sunday in the in this particular tradition they showed up
and elder shut up and said you do know you've broken Sabbath twice in a row right i mean that's
how far the cult was in controlling the group and so yes uh i feel you brother everything you're
saying man it just speaks to me so a couple super chats because you and me man we've got a vibe here
and humanist reformation seriously i appreciate that support i can you email me and i can ask
some questions or something of an academic to make up for the for the help and the support
i'd be happy to do so for for such a generous gift to us here at myth vision don't be fooled
our or day is a saying we still use today we just say men or second as we use clocks not
sundials after matthew 2436 jesus brings up noah who did not know the exact time god would judge
his generation but knew it would be his generation just like jesus
what do you what do you say about this matt i mean i'm i think that's a good point i think uh
oftentimes in responding to i mean because this is a set this is something that comes in the all
of it discourse in math 24 or uh mark 13 um and luke 21 and where jesus says this um no one knows
the day or the hour oftentimes christians will use that to say and that c s lewis actually did this
this claim of ignorance of total ignorance on the part of jesus saying that no one knows
anytime and so it becomes this kind of doctrine of perpetual immanence um that is then used to
discount what jesus says immediately prior to that and what he says immediately prior to that is
the son of man is coming uh and this generation will not pass away until all these things take
place every all of the signs of the times leading up to the coming of the son of man in that generation
and it was uh something that they could have you know they i mean marx readers matthew's
readers would have been reading that and they would have seen all these things happening around
70 ad the the year of the four emperors the fall of drusla and they would have been saying that
and they would have been saying that stuff is happening that means that this is the last
generation just like jesus said um and yeah the empire is collapsing right yep yep but jesus jesus
puts a little tag on that and he says heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass
away um in order to put put emphasis on that assured result of his coming in that generation
all these things taking place in that generation the kingdom arriving in that generation and
so the the the response of c.s louis and other christians to say well you know he
he says then immediately after you know who knows um goes flies directly in the face of that emphatic
declaration that everything's coming in that generation if you take it in that way of that
doctrine of perpetual eminence um and so i think this is a really good point that he's making here
where you're these people don't have watches they're looking at sundials and so the day or the hour
it's talking about the precise time the no one knows the precise time and the the the importance
of that in context is be ready watch pray because you don't know the exact time be ready for it at
any time which if you turn it into this doctrine actual eminence completely takes away that point
because you know why like if it could come today if it could come a million years from now
what's more likely is it really likely that it's going to come today no so it takes away from
the the takeaway that jesus is actually making in in in saying no one knows the day of the hour so
100 agree john collin sent me an article on his mark 13 and he was actually in response to
into right i got to send that to you it's not published yet what you mean i think it did send
it to me brilliant did i okay yeah he sent it to you no you did okay i sent it to you yeah i read
that and i was like oh snap even mark see this is what people i'm just hearing this so don't feel
bad i'm like let me say this is what i am just now seeing i spoke to paula freder just sent in
boston a few months back we recorded a bunch of episodes she told me you just got to rub it in
you got to rub it in every time it was magical it was magical and i asked about int right and i was
like let's let's do one on int right she says uh do you want to ruin the rest of my day this is what
she said and she's just like i don't want to go any i didn't want to comment anymore i wrote an
article i was told by my job i needed to review his book and she just her not only did her review
kind of emphasize you know is the day after the day of the lord supposed to remain the same before
and you mentioned that in your video which i hope people will go watch on your channel but i ask
it's so mind-boggling and she's telling me and she says it's in her paul the pagans apostle book but
tells me in person paul is late and i'm like hold what do you mean hold on i'm not understanding
what you're saying here she says paul the apostle paul and his literature is late i'm like that's
the earliest literature we have what do you mean she said paul is trying to wrestle with this apocalyptic
issue and he's late to the party the gospel of mark she said is extremely late so in the
gospel of mark it creates a dual generation model where you got pa uh jesus and his generation and
then you kind of have this like secondary and even they add in that map is mark nine is the specific
apocalyptic chapter that gets into the temple's destruction and then jesus goes but not even
the son of man knows the day or the hour kind of thing like like is it is the author trying to save
face is this an interpolation that's added into the mouth of jesus or is this the creation of mark
himself whoever the author is really trying to kind of say like it's gonna happen we're still holding
on but like remember now jesus himself said like you know i'm not exactly sure like i don't know
only the father in heaven for sure knows to try and protect jesus from being a fell the paul paula
ferdrickson on that point i think is brilliant because she makes that point uh that the that in
mark there is the separation of generations where the apostles generation i mean mark has a very
negative view of the disciples and of peter especially but he paints them negatively from
beginning to end where they don't get it they don't understand they're stubborn they're unbelieving
they have a veil over their eyes where they just don't get what jesus is about to the very end
jesus tells them you know i'm gonna come in galley i'm gonna meet you there and you know
the and then the women are silent and and it just the whole the ending of the thing is basically
they didn't get it they didn't they didn't see the fulfillment they didn't experience the eschatological
rest the implication is because they were blind and and so mark is with that saying you know
this generation will not pass away for him it's it's our generation it is the generation that has
seen 70 ad 40 years later we are the generation that that will see the coming of the day of the
lord that the apostles that the original disciples missed because they were unbelieving because they
had they were blind not only does this make me speculate which means i can't be dogmatic here
but i think paul or i think that mark knows paul and i've gone on speculation rants i've
wrote an article thinking there's something to that whole idea that the disciples don't get it
but guess who does get it paul and and this is the thing i think mark kind of gets is that paul
gets it and if you read paul's letters you can kind of get the hints that the 12 he has a beef
with kifis that like is mark seeing this is there some emphasis on painting these disciples this
way playing in your cognitive dissonance theory that they actually really kind of probably reflected
mark what they really believed in maybe what jesus actually was teaching this is the difficult
problem we can't get behind the veil it's difficult but but paul i mean it's there's several places
in paul's letters where it seems like he is grappling with that same tradition that same
dominical sayings tradition where jesus said this generation won't pass away or some standing here
won't taste death till they see the coming of the son of man all those sayings that talk about
this group not dying not not this generation still existing when he comes back um this is a place
first Corinthians 15 actually i think there's this there's this place in first Corinthians 15
which apologists love because they talk about the 500 brothers and paul has this little clause
where he says you know he appeared to 500 some of whom are still alive this little clause and
apologists who are you know sitting at their desks doing all their studies and
thinking that paul is talking kind of like a 20th 21st century scholar and saying like you know or
like a you know like a cold case detective or something like paul is saying hey if you don't
you don't take my word for it you can go and ask these eyewitnesses go and go and find them
and and ask them yourself and that's that's the point of him saying some of whom are still alive
is to say like go and verify my sources that's that's not at all the point of that the point in
saying some of whom are still alive is to answer the underlying dissonance having to do with that
saying's tradition that this generation would not pass away until all these things take place
paul is saying that generation hasn't fully passed away yet right there are some of those
whom jesus appeared to who are still alive and that and that is the way that he is responding
to the dissonance the the problem of delay that exists at the point that he is writing in the 50s
i'm with you man because the gospels can't let that go and even i think john's wrestling with
this too uh and john absolutely like he he's way late in the game but he's still making sense and
even he has in my opinion when you're reading that and he says some thought that he said he would never
die like that he would remain until jesus comes he rationalizes it even more radically yeah even
more radically it was a hypothetical he didn't mean to say that that the disciple that jesus loved
he's like what is yeah this is what if it makes it a point about jesus's authority that like if
he wanted to keep him alive until he comes right could because he has the authority to do that but
he didn't mean that he would be alive until right it's so apologetics 101 it's it's to me it's it's
obvious all right thank you so much for that i really appreciate it boris kaduco forgive me if i
forget that uh get that wrong what if the dissonance and apostles losing belief
the like i i'm gonna interpret this phrase because you got you only get so much room with a small
super chat i'm gonna interpret this like i'm gonna ask you and maybe if i'm wrong here boris forgive
me but it's did any dissonance cause any of these apostles to stop believing that's how i'm gonna
interpret this yeah and i think that's a really good question and that that i think um goes right
into a point that dale allison makes about how thin the evidence for the resurrection is that
we have to go on and how you know oftentimes apologists will appeal to the suffering and and
martyrdom of all of the apostles and make big claims about how all the apostles maintain faith
and died for their faith and um a lot of which is based on later legends about the apostles that
really don't have much genuine historical credibility to them but dale allison makes
this point that it's really outside of peter james and john really like you read the book of acts
which is late um but you read the book of acts and who knows what happens to any of the apostles
any of the 12 disciples after the first couple chapters of acts i mean after acts two
what happened to any of them we have no idea they could have come to their senses you know
after after a couple months and been like you know what wow or you know maybe they they they
really weren't that involved at all and who's to say we have no idea or they could have remained
faithful devotees of this cult yeah yeah and maybe they didn't they didn't go along all the way to
like paul's more extreme rationalization or john's more extreme rationalization um but but they were
you know closer to their jewish paucalic roots and didn't didn't didn't go i mean reading the
history when you get into like the details of which in the video that i made i i tried to
give the overarching response of uh you know what became the seventh day adventists um out of the
millerite movement but if you read the history it's a lot messier and there are a lot of different
you know responses that different people within the movement are giving um and a lot of them
you know william miller himself he reset the date a couple times and and it didn't happen and then
eventually he he gave up and was like no this isn't it and and uh that often happens i mean uh
herald camping uh which the the campingite movement in uh i think it's to may 21st 2011 is when
herald camping was saying that jesus will return and that was actually a redating of his prediction
in the 90s um where it failed and so he said oh okay you know we're move this around move this
around oh it's gonna come may 21st 2011 it doesn't happen and so he's he changes the date to october
it doesn't happen and just before his death he said he he he says you know what i was wrong
um but what's interesting about that is that even though he gave up and said he was wrong and went
back to a more mainstream i think baptist expression of of protestant faith uh there are
still camping i christians if you go on youtube look up a group called e bible fellowship and this
is a group of campingite believers the basis of their whole movement is that jesus did return
jesus did begin his judgment on may 21st 2011 and herald camping was right i mean he just understood
it as being an earthly thing and it's a spiritual heavenly thing um but it's it's the uh yeah
i want to just say like analogous to other ascending beings like uh looking at romulus or
looking at other figures other gods and things that may have had miraculous births it may not
be a virgin by the way i have an upcoming interview with m david litwa any even bart airman doesn't go
this far i'm not here to crap on anybody but look he did not i even had a bone to pick with the things
he said in his um other birch birch births course so i contacted his student in david litwa who went
even further than he did in many ways he says i wish he would have read my work that this is something
amazing like beef between father and son kind of but dude it's analogous because when you see all
of these other examples of other figures that you wouldn't say really did that romulus didn't
really get taken and ascend about olympus in the whole nine or you wouldn't say these other
figures really died in rose or whatever you want to say but jesus did it's like look at all of the
other apocalyptic failures and what they do but then you get to the new testament and you go it
can't be this this is true and so something's going on i hope people watching this will do
and speaking of which our good friend kaleb jackson is in the chat um kaleb thank you so much
does math you think cognitive dissonance caused the disciples to believe that tomb of jesus was
empty or did a real empty tomb contribute to their cognitive dissonance about resurrection
it's a great question um and i'm i'm open-ended about the empty tomb i think that dale allison
makes a really good case the strongest case i've seen for the empty tomb being historical
and so i think the empty tomb could have been a tangible thing that helped them make that leap
and this often happens uh the jahoba's witnesses are a great example of this where they they made a
number of predictions that didn't come to pass but uh they predicted jesus would return in 1914
and they predicted that he would return in 1918 you think about well 1914 and 1918 what significant
things happened in those dates well that's the beginning and the ending of world war one that's
beginning and ending of the great war and that that coincidence for those on the outside of the
movement we would say that's just a coincidence for those on the inside of the movement that is a
tangible thing that happened in the real world that that confirmed their faith and so they were
able to rest on that and reinterpret um in such a way so that you know the i think the language
that they said is like the the end of the the gentile age or something um is what the is what
1914 became um and so they used those concrete substantial more substantial events um to and
that just helps them helps them to rationalize more but it's not the full thing that they were
previously expecting another example of this is uh i mean this is the original father of cognitive
dissonance theory here uh leon festinger when prophecy fails if you want to go back to the
beginning of cognitive dissonance theory this is it uh 1956 but they study this group uh this ufo
cult is predicting the end of the world and when it doesn't happen they are reading the paper and
they find that there was an earthquake somewhere and they say oh that earthquake was part of it
they take that on board and say it did happen it we misunderstood and uh that the you see this
earthquake that was part of it um so anyway answering your question kaleb i think that
the tomb could have been empty someone could have stolen the body necromancers uh uh you know
magicians body parts of holy men body parts of uh people who were uh killed in in gruesome ways
were very valuable um to necromancers that's a very weird thought but as you were saying dale
alson makes this point then i think that it's a really good point um but any number of groups that
were unknown to the disciples could have taken the body and or unknown to the most committed of the
disciples uh could have taken the body and then they see this empty tomb and that helps them make
that leap to he was risen um i think that there is a good very strong argument that the empty tomb
is a legend um and that it's not historical but i'm i don't i wouldn't you know either way yeah
let me paint it another way to kind of answer this question or have you affirm whether i'm on the
right track whatever reason and it can be a number of reasons in fact james tabour makes a case that
they relocated the body because of the holy day and what was going on they put like the way he takes
this approach and i do not want to put too many words in my friend dr tabour's mouth but it's the
idea that they temporarily stuck him somewhere because a day the day ending nightfall um and they
had the right according to not only their heber scriptures but maybe the roman empire allowed
them to do such things to keep their festivals going into be obedient to their laws and customs
so they bury him temporarily and then relocate him that after the nightfall the next day they
were able to relocate him and when they relocate him it's not like the sandhedron got together
you know these little nutty guys who followed him call up peter and tell him we put him in
tomb c three you know like or whatever or put him in a different place whatever it might be i'm just
throwing it out there whatever the reason the body could have left if we play in that sandbox
you're saying that if there was a missing body this would be the rationalization he had to have
ascended or he had to have been uh resurrected or really dignified that's combined with post you
know bereavement hallucinations or or you know visions of the recently deceased which is a really
common phenomenon especially for people who are very connected to an individual who have a very
deep relationship with someone to see that person after they've died he's extremely normal um and so
if they had these visions of jesus after he died and also the tomb was empty i mean
there it is right there thank you yeah that paul's an interesting subject on that but that's a whole
different discussion too and what i think might be going on there humanist reformation again thank
you for that love if you search oikimene oxford dictionary the usage of the word for world used
in matthew 24 14 and loop two one means roman world it was changed around 400 ad when it was
clear jesus words felled as the end never came very dishonest of the church
i don't have anything to add to that yeah i have an investment i have not investigated in
discovering the church is using it to mean universally the planet um i know that oikimene
doesn't just have that meaning like it obviously gets applied to the taxing of the roman empire in
luke which would be the natural reading right you would think oh the oikimene the roman world which
the same i mean it was in it was the known world to them it's at the time it's like that is the
world right and so i do see even paul uses from what i understand oikimene in his preaching
that the gospel must go to the whole world um preach to every creature under heaven things like
that uh before the end but he's imagining he's playing that part and he literally is traveling
the major cities and it's happening that they're that they're at the they're at the cusp of the end
of that you know where jesus said this gospel must go forth you know to to all the nations
before the end will come and he's it seems like paul is like yeah we're doing it where
that we're almost there just a little bit further i just got to get to spain right yeah he's trying
to spain i also think it's interesting if we take this approach to the lost israelites the myth of
the lost israelites stayed alive even many people don't know this but the scholars v bendor benit who
wrote about the myth of the lost israelites christopher columbus was trelling literally traveling
as a christian across sea voyaging looking for the israelites because they have to be out there
because the text says that they're you know this is part of their prophecy they needed to be fulfilled
finally when you finally like traveled almost all the tribes on planet earth the rationalization was
you know what maybe they've been under our nose maybe they're one of these like
tribes these indian tribes or african tribes or something that we just didn't notice
and they were there the whole time hence mormonism joseph smith different things so
it's an interesting point and i need to investigate how the church started to do that but i imagine
it's pretty common listen to christians today the whole world that's a little note about that too
that might that might be significant in terms of cognitive dissonance is that where it's a matthew
24 where the text says and and luke there are mark 13 where it says that you know that this this
gospel must go must go out to all the nations and then the end will come since schweitzer at least
there has been a strong presence of new jessamine scholars and e p sanders was one of these i believe
who you know may have the claim of being the most influential new jessamine scholar of the 20th
20th century um but who argue that that that saying this this gospel must be preached to
all the nations and then the end will come is itself a rationalization and a reinterpretation
of an earlier saying which appears in matthew 10 23 where jesus says you won't finish preaching
you won't finish going through the cities of israel right before the end comes um and if you read
the surrounding context it's it's a lot of the same content um in both of those places and that
that little clause is right there in the middle where those two different statements are in both
versions um and so it seems like they are based on the same thing and so the question is okay which
one is older and why was it changed and it makes a lot of sense to see the the matthew 10 version
the you won't finish going throughout the cities of israel before the son of man comes
seeing that as the more original version and the you know this gospel must be preached to all the
nations and then the end will come as being the redacted reinterpreted version because
yeah because they now gone out beyond they've now gone beyond israel they're into the diaspora
they're the you know post 70 ad and jesus still hasn't come back so we have to extend it further
um but i think that makes a lot of sense i asked that of dale allison junior once and
at his house and he was like well it could be that's what i like about him right he he's not
like a dogmatist but he doesn't you could tell he wrestles with this you can tell me in fact i heard
through the grapevine some christians are saying he's going to be writing a book where he's like
not taking the position he once took i got i need to talk to him just to get his thoughts
no judgment dale if you're watching this um but he in his in his commentary he even throws that
as an option but i think he tries to rationalize in some other way of interpreting it based on
the fact that other people try to do that way i think you're on point though uh dale allison
i just have to say dale allison is my favorite new testament scholar hands down and the video
that i just made on cognitive distance and christian origins is really highly derivative
of this book right here which this the end of the ages has come this is dale's uh phd thesis
that was then published later on as a book um and absolutely brilliant stuff but he has been
grappling with cognitive dissonance studies his entire career and this book uh like if you can if
you can read something that is engaging with cognitive dissonance theory and historical
jesus studies and inaugurated eschatology realized eschatology um you want to read further if you
watch that video that i made this is where i would start and he goes all the way up to the end he
actually is is very unlike nt right he he does a lot with cognitive dissonance theory and thinks
that it explains a lot he takes it all the way up to the edge of cognitive dissonance theory
explaining the origins of belief in the resurrection and then he stops before jumping over the cliff
he stops just shy and he gives his reasons for that i want to make a video hopefully soon responding
to that and explaining why i think that we should go further than than he goes but subscribe
dale allison end of the ages has come phenomenal book absolutely i did pin your your youtube this
is a great plug time just to let people know like this is a great plug go subscribe to his youtube
channel the video that is actually the topic we're discussing today is how cognitive dissonance
explains christianity on his video and he has an article that is also in the description there
i put it in the description here as well just kept it there but um you can do that there and
then of course i have some courses that are coming out that are going to kind of go into the history
of christians explaining this but you're right is this a fossil and paula frederick saying in her
book paul the pagans apostle literally is making this the point that paul's wrestling with scripture
he mentions you know he gets his gospel and the way he's looking at some stuff he's getting his
revelations out of scripture as well and is this well the reason jesus hasn't come back yet is because
there are certain prophecies he sees within his scripture of the nations needing to come in
jesus's mission may have been to the jews or to israel whereas he needs to come in
which is why he might see himself as another jeremiah as another god has counted the number
of hairs on my head like i am this last day prophet who's going to come in and he even
identifies himself with christ sometimes mystically speaking where he's like in my body
i am filling up what was lacking in christ paul says this so he is identifying himself in this
strange pivotal over the edge of history kind of position and i like what you said there yeah
go to israel first go to the jews first and in fact that motto keeps getting sung in the
early church and they can't let go of it to the jew first then to the greek ah okay so
they got to like start pushing this thing outward to keep to make jesus come back
you know we got to we got to do this interesting interesting and it also gets into that debate
that you did before on whether this is conditional or if this isn't and it makes you wonder if there
was a moment through this cognitive dissonance where conditionality becomes a thing again
because you can see it absolutely you know which which is going to be from what i've seen the the
project that that allison is working on right now um he actually does and in part of his response
in his reason for not taking cognitive dissonance all the way is uh that he actually does think
that that conditionality argument has something to it um but it's very strange to me because he
does that after pointing out that that conditional conditionality point is a classic way of responding
to dissonance and rationalizing after the fact and so i'm not sure quite how he works that out
but i'm interested to see where he goes with it for sure be on the lookout limited light thank you
for the super chat i'm in i'm reinterpreted as a hologramic reptilenoid transhumanic by the
prophets of cuff of a 19 anti-vax that's how they deal with me still being alive and healthy
did he convince you i can believe it yeah thank you so much limited light i seriously
appreciate the support graze 174 do you have an anti supernatural bias
uh i want to say no i mean but the the thing is is that i came from a place of fully buying
into the supernatural and um i'm i'm very open to it now and in fact kaleb jackson um is that
that it's kaleb jackson who commented a little bit earlier he's got a project that he's working on
that is about miracles is about healing reports and i'm really interested to see that i know he
did an interview recently with capturing christianity about that um and i am very open to that the thing
is is that what tends to be the case i mean i do think that there's something to what does it say
and saw you know extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence in the way that i would
interpret that is that uh things that are not claims that are not conciliant not consistent
with our most reliable knowledge that that our knowledge that has been arrived at through our
most reliable tools and methods um should have enough empirical evidence to them to overcome
the the the the you know prevalent view based on the most reliable knowledge that we have through
our most reliable tools and methods um if you're going to posit something that that that is radically
inconsistent in some way with the view of the world that we come at with you know the hardest data
that we have the hardest tools and methods of arriving at that view that we have you you need
to have a lot going for that view enough to overcome that dissonance to bridge that gulf and
at this point any claims of healing with a miraculous that i have seen just don't bridge
that gulf for me they don't cross that distance and give me enough evidence to alter a naturalistic
view of the world um but i'm open you know and and but the thing that goes into that too and
you might call this an anti-supernatural bias but it's my experience in an apocalyptic community
that was a highly charismatic community that believed in dreams believed in visions believed
in healings and had stories to go along with that there's a lot of those stories that i can
look back on and see the ways that those stories changed the ways that they were rationalized the
ways that they didn't quite add up and then there's a lot of other stories that i have absolutely no
idea what to do with that still puzzle me and that i you know that that that that do cause me
actual dissonance because i don't have any explanation for them but what i do with that
what i do with that is i just put it on the shelf because it's not enough to overturn
a worldview that is arrived at by you know which i would say is just you know a kind of a
placeholder is that what i would bank on what seems most likely given the evidence that we have
but that's on the shelf that causes me a little bit of dissonance and i'm open to being proven wrong
Dale Allison again has his newest book is about christian experience and he argues that a lot of
that is genuine and i don't know i think the world is a weird place i think that the universe is
really strange and we don't know everything and so i'm open to being proven wrong and changing my
mind that's that's what's gotten me to where i am now and so i want to keep open keep doing that
i'd like to take a jab at this if you don't mind um i know graze watch me a lot and i get this
question from time to time and i'll usually just say no you know i don't think i do but uh or at
least i maybe don't dive deep enough i think i might actually have um a bias in this uh anti
supernatural bias being open and honest um looking at the definition of prejudice in favor of or
against one thing person or group compared with another usually in a way considered to be unfair
right so if you're using it in a pejorative way christians would say this is just unfair they think
the evidence meets that requirement in their head in some way and i know because i used to
believe this but the reasonings that i came out was never be it wasn't like i'm now going to turn
around and deny all the miracles i witnessed and solve the supernatural and deny it it's not like
that um there's also a systematic distortion of a statistical result due to a factor not allowed
for in its deriv derivation the verb is to cause to fill or show inclination of prejudice for
against someone or something i'd go with this something here and yes i do have this prejudice
but it's based on the experience of what i have like you said all these natural tools the hard
evidence that i've dealt with for so long the like a testimony is just not gonna do it so it's
like dude you're gonna need to like uh matt deland he said when he was asked the question what would
convince him or make him a christian and he goes god would know if god existed and i know that's
such a cop out answer to people who go no no no give me the thing like what's the thing and it's like
okay don't you think that this god would know how to do that with my fickle human mentality and
mind and being a risen ape on this planet like come on so i think there might be but if it's
used as a pejorative as if like oh you're just antagonistic nothing will convince you yeah right
no i mean i'm like there's i'm sure there's things that could it's just nothing has as far as i'm
concerned everything looks to quote you as you quoted the bible all things remain the same as
they have since the beginning of time in second peter i also apply that not to the apocalypse but
i'm applying that to like just the way nature functions and even christians mind you in that
upcoming course on the quest for the historical jesus del points out christian rationalists came in
and they saw laws of nature are broken so they had to rationalize why jesus's tomb was empty or
why he walked on water it was never a miracle it was some natural explanation and honestly i'll
say this is that there there is a part of me that that does have an anti-supernatural bias but then
there is another very large part of me that has a pro-supernatural bias where i would love nothing
more than to live in a universe like that i would like nothing more to live in a place with that is
infused with the possibility that a loving god who wants to heal and restore and has a good plan
for his creation um that sounds amazing to me and when i lost faith i was a universalist so i would
love to go back to that universalist form of christianity i think that there is evidence for
that in you know there there are some textual new testament sources that support universalism
and so i would i would be absolutely thrilled to be to be able to go back to that version of
christianity and to be a charismatic christian who believes in the that god that strange things
like that happen and that they're a part of this overarching good plan that god has for creation
absolutely yeah i just don't i'm open to it yeah i don't see it um at this point you know i just
don't see it anymore especially after learning about the natural world and evolution and things
like this right it's like it doesn't seem loaded with death i mean it's there's so much so i don't
want to psych myself out or play cognitive dissonance on existence in this world either so
i need a worldview that matches reality for me and not uh wishful thinking rainbow crampus thank you
for the super chat here's my tithe take this church money and sanctify it in your cleansing light
or cleansing windex or whatever you are blessed my friend you are blessed thank you so much for
that i appreciate the tithe uh we have another one here and it's graze 174 thoughts on an alternative
where the disciples thought he was coming back soon hence new testament passages addressing it but he
himself never predicted that this gets it yeah that's yeah the the jesus seminar uh which was
really popular 15 20 years ago um this is the route that they took and they in order to get there
they had to say that you know we have we have the sources of the new testament that we have and
then there's q which is a common source uh positive source between luke and matthew the places where
luke and matthew agree with each other but not with mark that is uh this hypothetical source called q
and the q that we have does have all of these apocalyptic sayings in it and so what they had
to do was say that well there must have been an earlier version of q where that these apocalyptic
elements weren't there and that is the earliest q and so you're already dealing with a you're
already dealing with a hypothetical document which i think has good evidence in favor of it i lean
i think towards believing in it in a q um but it's a hypothetical document we don't have it right and
they pause it these earlier stages of redaction of q of this hypothetical document so they end
up building a really huge house on a very shaky foundation in order to get to this conclusion
that jesus was an apocalyptic prophet and that is the the more liberal version of trying to
get a non-apocalyptic jesus um but to me it's just the the the mental gymnastics that you
have to do in order to get that and uh just doesn't no never seemed persuasive to me to me it's pretty
it's one of those things that convinced me out of mythicism into a historical jesus model
and it was simple mundane things jesus was crucified paul says okay josephus talks about
jews being crucified by romans a lot phylo talks about jews being crucified by romans a lot we see
it in the gospels which is christian literature and mark seems to know paul he talks about jesus
being crucified and he uses paul he's got the thrust of pauline theology in a way yet he puts
him on earth crucified by romans so for me it was like paul thinks jesus was crucified in outer space
by demons and not convinced personally anymore my point is is to flip the coin and go here you
have john the baptist or you have an apoc you have paul apocalyptic right he seems to be in the tradition
of a jesus he knows them if he didn't why is he persecuting the early christians he has to know
what they teach in order to be offended by something that they're saying about jesus so now he's somehow
part of their movement or aware of what they're saying and then he flips sides so my point is
he's apocalyptic you have an early gospel mark earliest at least you have an apocalyptic figure
like john the baptist to me it's kind of this thrust of like you have a that's as far back as we
can go it's everywhere whether you're looking at paul the the what comes out of jesus the earliest
that we have is apocalyptic right what was before jesus john the baptist what jesus came out of
that was apocalyptic so the in between them you have this missing link jesus to say that he is not
apocalyptic when both the movement that he came out of and the movement that came out of him were
both apocalyptic right come on it's hard to see other yeah and graze wanted to correct it and said
i mean he never predicted coming back soon not that he never predicted coming back i don't know
if jesus predicted in coming ever this is the point we're trying to say yeah i don't think he ever
predicted to coming back i think the coming back is the rationalization when he when the the the
exaltation of the son of man that he expected to be the the the outworking i think when he was
going up to drusalom he wasn't expecting to die when he was going up to drusalom he was
expecting the kingdom of god to come then and there when when we have that saying of him saying
you know the uh i won't eat of the the fruit of the vine or i won't drink of the fruit of
the vine i won't eat again until you know uh we eat in the kingdom of god i think that speaks to
the imminent expectation they were saying we're on the cusp of the kingdom of god right here the
next time brothers the next time we eat it's gonna be in the kingdom that's a saying that sounds like
a fossil and then yeah and then he gets and then he gets crucified instead um and and so they have
to reinterpret that to speak of oh well he was talking about the new covenant that he was
establishing through his death and that's the eucharist now where they're eating and drinking
oh so this is his body this is his blood yes and that's yeah um but uh yeah so the all the coming
back stuff is their reinterpretation after he after he left um now the coming refers to this
they split the eschaton in two into two different stages so there's a first coming and a second
coming um jesus didn't have any expectation of a second coming there was no expectation of a
second coming it was just the coming the coming of the son of man the the exaltation of the son
of man the coming of the kingdom of god it was one thing they split it into two things when the
one thing didn't happen john dominacrossan's book render and seizures a worthy read because
of course whatever you think about his views of jesus literally historically and like how he tries to
kind of escape that what we're talking about here in his revelation parts in that book he shows
that the author john is aware of not only the uh the i can't believe i'm not able to think the
the greek literature which then became jewish and then christian later sibling oracles and how
they are actually using the neuron redivivus mythology um to like mimic that with jesus's
return so they're like it's a competing model where you have mirrors coming back from his death
where he's he's literally struck down and died he's coming back jesus is coming to the northern
yeah yeah so like there's this this is interesting it makes you wonder what's going on man this is
crazy michael uh minder sorry minder bender i appreciate your eliminating response to my
previous question are these groups more prone to having visions because of their dissonance
what do you think what's the possible relationship yes um absolutely i have a book on my shelf
it's too far away to grab go ahead no no no this is an interesting thing because he mentioned
earlier with the millerite movement he the guy is like in a panic freaking out oh yeah
sex hallucinations he's got a whole section on um visions of the recently deceased he's got a
section on uh religious visions that are fueled by uh you know fasting or by by uh meditating actually
he engages with this book which is incredible c.m. the roman
oh i'm understanding the american uh evangelical relationship with god um but uh both of those
books deal a lot with visionary experiences and the way that those visionary experiences can be
induced by uh what t.m. lerman describes it as is the technology of prayer the practice of
of making god real through meditation um and by making him real through meditation by fasting
by prayer by all of these different means and different religious traditions which there was a
a very real tradition within i mean apocalyptic judaism you read like uh uh Habakkuk is a great
example of this the first half of Habakkuk is him praying asking god to answer this question of the
problem of evil the problem of delay how long oh lord when and then he's and then he concludes
you know what i'm going to take my place i'm going to pray i'm going to wait i'm going to be patient
and i'm going to see what god says to me and then the last chapter of apocalyptic three
he has a vision and in the vision he sees god coming back and establishing justice over the world
and that i think sets up a template another example of this is uh ezekiel one where ezekiel
has this throne chariot vision and there's a whole tradition of jewish mysticism that came out of those
things um and we were talking earlier about the quran community daniel is an example of this too
daniel engages with abakkuk two and abakkuk three in in his visions where he sets dates where he
describes these visionary experiences and daniel is not written by daniel it's backdated it's
classic apocalyptic literature where it's something that is happening during the macabean revolt and
it says oh this is actually visions that were had by a guy way back when um that we're speaking
about our time but i absolutely believe that there were experiences that the author of daniel
did have he wasn't just a complete fraud he really was someone who believed in these
visionary experiences and who was fasting and praying and asking god for revelation
about his coming about his promises of restoration about what he said in abakkuk about what he said
in jerelia he said there was going to be seven 70 years and then we would be restored well it's
been a lot longer than 70 years and we haven't been restored god give me revelation and then
daniel nine daniel gets this revelation that says actually it's not 70 years it's 70 times
70 years it's it's 490 years and this is an angelic visionary response but this is a tradition
that tradition of visionary experiences goes hand in hand in the jewish apocalyptic tradition
with this technology of prayer with this technology of fasting these ways of actually inducing those
experiences in order to i mean you know they believe that by doing these things by these
practices they are opening themselves up to get revelation from god um and enti right actually
in his book on paul his paul a biography he speculates that paul's vision on the road to
demascus was actually induced on paul's part he doesn't say induced but that paul was grappling
with the tensions the long-standing tensions of his jewish eschatological faith i think so
and that he is meditating right thinks maybe he was meditating on on izikio one and the
throng chariot vision and he's he's he's practicing that and he's looking up to the different levels
and where you would picture yaway on his throne on the top level he goes up and he sees jesus there
and that vision of the exaltation of jesus answers the dissonance that paul has as a jewish apocalyptic
pharisaical you know his his jewish apocalyptic faith it's it gives him an explanation that
actually the end has begun actually the thing that you're hoping for the thing you're expecting
the answer to the problem of evil the answer to the problem of delay that you feel so acutely
it's in jesus and there's something really attractive about that right there's something
really attractive about that someone who i mean you know but all that to say like yes i think that
that uh dissonance does create visions and um all of her sax book goes into that tm lerman's
book goes into that i'd recommend it two comments if you don't mind is just i don't necessarily buy
the narrative of axe that he's literally on a road to demascus two guys are with him that kind of
thing sounds more like a fictional narrative um but i don't have any problem concluding that a real
valid experience took place i don't have to run down the path that i've heard some people do
where they try to just say he's a complete fraud and con and did it for money or something it's
like no no no i think this guy's a mystic i think he is completely charismatic just like i was when
i was in the church i hook line and sinker bot believed what they were giving me in that cup
and it was a bunch of kool aid my point is is he's seeing things and then also taking your position
about fasting and then of course trauma in the death of someone the gospels kind of paint it like
they're afraid for their life number one the roman empire is not to be messed with number two
their master their teacher's dead he's that's the morning of a death of a loved one i i believe it's
in the account one of the accounts even in one of the other gospels that aren't found in our
canon as well james table talks about how they fast in some of these like they really took this
serious and they're not are they sleeping good are they fasting are they praying i bet you they're
doing all of these and that's the perfect storm for going off out of body experiences and being able
to try and experience something other than what you're living in right now in the crazy chaos
so i'm with you on that and yeah just my thought in the in the group that i was a part of we had
a saying where we would say you know because we would all be having these crazy visionary experiences
dreams dreams and visions all the time and the the question we would ask ourselves is
threefold was it god was it the devil or was it the pizza and the the the the three and it's
it's almost like a kind of c.s louis trilemma or something but it's just that there's there's only
three things it could be either it's from god it's divine revelation and you should take it to the
bank it's true or it was it was deceitful it was from evil spirits it was from the devil
or you just ate something and you know it was just weird and you just say okay well i don't
know what to do with that and it's it's neither god or the devil and so there was this kind of
you know third category that you could say who knows but the option that wasn't on the list
was the fasting the option that wasn't on the list was the praying the opposite option that
wasn't on the list was the fact that we were reading the book of revelation constantly reading
the book of daniel constantly asking for these things to happen to us asking for god to give us
this revelation it becomes so fulfilling yeah because next you know you get a vision you're like
ah it's verified next i've hey he did it like if you but that's the worldview right the worldview
is that you have that supernatural worldview where your plausibility structures are set up in such a
way that if you get it it's one or the other either it's from god or it's from satan so if you're
seeking god god's going to give you revelation right it can't just be the natural phenomena that
the technology or the as you keep calling it it can't just be the natural phenomena of what i think
memories or visionary things i think it took in kind of like a dream at night or often previous
memories and sometimes are discombobulated together and you go that dream made no sense you know
uh it can't just i think in our you know post enlightenment world i think one disservice
that we've done is is by uh ostracizing people who have these experiences of visions the visions
are the recently deceased you know bereavement hallucinations things like that um people think
that they're crazy when they have those kinds of experiences and so they don't talk about them um
but there's a very welcome movement i think in uh these kinds of books that that i'm referring to
where uh and dale allison is a great example of doing pulling out this research that was often
labeled as like paranormal research or something but um just the data is that people have these
kinds of experiences all the time and we don't talk about them that much in our culture but i
think that that lends itself towards then reading about you know religious movements like early
christianity and not have not having any explanation outside of they were lying and i think that you
know the the the more likely explanation is is that they were true believers and it's being a
true believer is what generates that kind of experience um but uh oliver sacks compares that
kind of experience of like a bereavement who hallucination uh vision of the recently deceased
to uh the lost limb sensation and it's that when you have when you lose a limb this thing that was
a part of your body for so long it creates dissonance when that's not there anymore your brain
can't can't fathom that it's not there and so you often feel the sensation of that limb still
being there even though it's not there anymore and this same thing happens with our loved ones
when we are in deep relationships with other people and then those people aren't there anymore
there's a phantom limb sensation that you know the the strong sense of presence of these people
and that strong sense of presence often actually manifests itself in in visual stimulation in visual
phenomenon where your brain actually creates the perception that this person is standing there
and it looks real or you hear their voice and it feels real just as real as when you lose a limb
and you have this sensation of it still being there um right and you know it's it's i think it's
the same kind of thing but the root of that in all of these cases is dissonance right the root of it
is that you have an expectation for that thing being there it's not there anymore and your brain
makes up the difference it's so what you just said is extremely profound and i think i i think
if more people on both sides try to understand that both explanations or things first of all
from the from the person who actually has the experiences and who's having the visionary things
like if you're skeptic like me grant that people are doing this don't try to be so antagonistic
but there is a difficulty in personality issues here too because the person who has the experience
it's so real to them they impose that perception and subjective experience on through others and
saying it's obvious Jesus is this you're going to go to hell like i saw one chat here someone was
like this subjective mumbo jumbo i have to find what it says something about naturalism and i mean
they literally just they like they are seeing me in flames right now this is how far they are
projecting right and it's like dude bless you bless you yeah right like it's creating though
such a tribalistic thing rather than just addressing the phenomena and you have your
interpretation mr mystic and person who explains it and look i can never falsify that i can't
with your arm that might be something i could actually do like i can say hey dude you don't
have a hand but you feel like you have a hand i get it like i could maybe falsify that to you
or at least we could both try to work that out together and still i would say i believe i have
a hand in my heart maybe the real arm is the friends we made along the way yeah that's pretty
funny i have a hand into my heart but i do think that's that's funny um i do think that we should
recognize they are experiencing something and being fair to that but it's like can can they be fair
on the other side and see can they actually see or is their mind so within that experience in bubble
they can't see how we are seeing this as a natural phenomena that is completely evolutionary um you
could look at it and say this is normal it doesn't need a real demon a real god a real devil a real
angel that doesn't really have to exist for that experience that you are having in your brain
to take place and if they can't see that mind you i'm speaking here from you and me who both
been on the receiving end of experiences like that saying that we now have different explanations
for those experiences i have seen things not only with drug induced stuff but also through the
meditation the fasting and the whole the literal brainwashing of religious music going from a high
up praise you lord to a deep crying on the ground thinking i'm in the presence of god and before
his throne in the whole nine you're not talking to some idiot who doesn't know what is going on
it has that experience so i don't know i'm venting so i'm with you man i'm with you oh well great
great question um next super chat here isn't a question it's just support great expectations
let me make sure great expectations did not ask a question and then we'll wrap up here shortly
i'm just trying to get through these super chats this has been dude we could do another episode
and legitimately dive deeper and go further because i didn't even get into the cognitive
dissonance of full preterism that i went to my experience in why i started saying jesus did come
back we just didn't understand the meaning of these words so he did come it was the destruction of the
Jerusalem temple and now in retrospect now that i've escaped that i could see anti-Semitism so
derived from this because it's like the the final absolute fulfillment was god's destruction of
his own temple with his own people in it the romans are not gonna get their butts handed to them
no other nations it's just his own people who get destroyed and somehow i i found that to be the
climatic in because i found in deuteronomy talks about in your last days you eat the flesh of your
children and like there's this idea that they are going to be punished in their last days in deuteronomy
and i thought oh this you know full preterism has a way a systematic way of trying to explain
a way the meaning of certain words to somehow make it all about 70 ad the book of revelations not
about Rome at all nero fits into the beast mark and that's how we could say that this is first century
and it's 70 but it's really not about Rome it's all about Jerusalem it's all about israel gary demar
kenneth gentry all of these guys writing their partial preterist perspectives yeah and so anyway
we can go deeper at some point let's do it okay sorry i had to say that if people want that comment
that let us know if you want us to go deep into the weeds on some of this stuff i am all game willing
to do that and uh it's really a matter of if i can twist matt's arm to come on to do it it's a
matter of you man can i don't take much twisting yeah you man i love i love talking with you
humanist reformation again man thank you please email me remember i want to try and make up for
the help the problem with saying he never said he was coming back is that you need to throw out the
bible the only evidence for jesus keep up preaching the truth guys thanks
and that is that is the it is the misunderstanding rationalization to the ultimate degree um which
let me uh just read this is a quote that i had in uh in that video that i did um
but i'll just read it here this is j gordon melton his book about what happens what really
happens when when prophecy fails uh spiritualization and reaffirmation um but he goes on after the
quote that i gave previously he says this uh the believer does not react to the non-converment
the non-occurrence of the event by admitting failure to do so would call into question the
total experience of the group instead the believer begins a process of reinterpretation
the believer begins to see not that the prophecy was incorrect but that the group merely misunderstood
it in a material earthly manner its truth came at a spiritual level invisible except the eyes of
faith thus from the original prophesied event the believers create an invisible spiritual and
more importantly unfalsifiable event by doing so the group saves the prophecy from failure
retains its close connection with cosmic history and provides the condition under which its work
can continue individuals even thoughtful leaders might depart from uh might depart this goes into
what we were talking about earlier with individuals versus the group experience individuals even
thoughtful leaders might depart but the group survives the payment for such a spiritualization
of its prophecy is low the mere admission of a slight error in perception a readily acceptable
human failure the price is small compared with the loss of both faiths in the community
and the intimate relationship with the cosmos implied in admitting that the prophecy might have
failed this is the key part for the group prophecy does not fail it is merely misunderstood
but i think that that the the jesus seminar response is just taking that explanation of
misunderstanding saying that the disciples you know it's trying to save jesus ultimately what
you're doing is if you can say everything else is wrong as long as jesus was right
and you can throw out the entire bible you can throw out everything and i think there are expressions
of you know kind of deconstructed you know deconstruction or more progressive versions
of christianity that are willing to throw out everything except this this construct of jesus
that is just the the dissonance has caused them to reinterpret to such a degree that they have
this this this thing that they're banking on that stands over and against all of the data
that we actually have all of the evidence that we actually have in the texts that we have in
history that we have and is really just something that they've created a kind of talisman a cipher
for their own thoughts their own desires but that's just the the extreme example of what what you have
again and again in all of these movements i can't find a single book well there might be books that
don't address this because they're so short like the book of jude but even then sounds kind of
apocalyptic but like the satan fighting over the body of moses like what's going on like the
this seems to be inakian in a way and like even that has an eschatological expectation but there's
not a single book in the new testament that i don't see something either reacting to or actually
implicitly saying and expressing the end or something like that even the book of james right
which even martin luther saw serious differences between james and paul and revelation like you
name it like they're all in the same river going the same way they're not swimming upstream and you
go why would someone want to go to jesus and they go but he wasn't even like that at all
and then you see the kumran like look at the dead sea scrolls come out and then we're like yep
they're all going down the same stream too but no so i think we're on and it's interesting
uh and to you right in this this is the first my first experience with cognitive dissonance was
reading this book and his his reaction to cognitive dissonance which at the time it was great for me
reading that and being like oh yay amen like i can just you know cognitive dissonance he puts it in
quotes you know cognitive dissonance the hypothetical state he calls in and then just kind of throws it
to the side but he says that the problem with cognitive dissonance ultimately is that we don't
have any other examples of cognitive dissonance in the first century and he says he says we don't see
much evidence of cognitive dissonance in josephus and i think that example is especially uh interesting
and uh hilarious because josephus you read josephus's jewish wars and he a big part of the point
that josephus is making in his overall defense of juda i mean he's trying to make a version of
judaism palatable to the roman world right um and trying to smooth over a lot of the political uh
ideological religious tensions between uh the the the you know more educated elite jews um and and
they're you know his roman patrons um but a big part of the the the the goal of josephus's work
is to say that the worldview that he previously had because josephus was one of those guys in the wars
the worldview that he previously had that was that apocalyptic worldview expecting a messiah to come
and deliver and he and he talks about he says that you know that's driven by these prophecies
about a messiah coming it's probably referring to daniel um that these people and their resistance
against roam was driven by this messianic expectation and josephus says but they misunderstood the
prophecies i knew you understood the prophecies and those prophecies about a king with a scepter
ruling the nations and all of that that was actually that was actually the roman empire
that was actually the roman emperor that was demission that was you know and uh or uh titus
titus yeah uh and titus and he reinterprets jewish messianic expectation and applies it and says that
that the jewish the anointed king is actually the roman emperor that i mean tell me that's
cognitive this we don't we don't see much much evidence of cognitive dissonance josephus the whole
the whole apologetic thrust of josephus's point in his jewish histories in the jewish wars is
to reduce dissonance and to maintain a version of jewish faith that is palatable in the roman
world post 70 ad that one's the like most obvious that you just described and there's others i would
say are potentials like when philo and josephus are writing apologetics for judaism against apion
for example and others like they paint their figures greco roman like so they're already changing
like if you read your bible anyone opens your bible moses died get over it he they don't know
where he was buried the bible says he couldn't enter the promise land get into josephus and philo
guess who didn't die moses what happened to him oh he looks like romulus he looks like he's ascended
into heaven why i can't imagine cognitive dissonance limits or stays only in the apocalyptic scope
it's gotta go out into how can i make mine better or at least equal with yours and they're dealing
with arguments with with pagans so they're defending their heritage their tradition and
even if it goes as far as remaking and reshaping the narrative that is contrary to their own scripture
and we see this all the time even the way he interprets the contradiction between
joseph was sold to the midianites or the ishmaelites i can't remember what the two groups were
he chooses one and doesn't mention the other in his commentary on the history of the jews going
back from genesis onward he doesn't mention both groups he sees the issue and this is in the first
century so we need to take a deeper dive and we need to address this issue because i am starting
to be more and more convinced that cognitive dissonance theory isn't just going to address
apocalypticism but even other ideas within the theology or whatever it might be
yep the explanatory scope and the explanatory power of cognitive dissonance is extraordinary
wow okay pressing on love this topic theresa thank you so much for that super chat i am skeptical
about visions maybe because i've never experienced one yeah i mean i think that that our post
enlightenment world so discourages that kind of experience and our life is we just don't live in
the same kind of world that fosters the same kind of expectation that you know highly charged
religious environments actually foster but it is amazing that the human mind is amazing and it's
amazing what you can make yourself believe about reality and what you can make yourself see in reality
um that that that isn't actually there um carl yung uh had a really fascinating study
about ufo sightings um in the 1950s when ufo sightings were breaking out for the first time
across the u.s and it was during uh you know the the there was the scare of the atomic bombs and
of russia the ussr all this all of these big existential fears and all of a sudden people
are having these these these experiences seeing these you know spacemen from outer space coming
and sometimes those experiences were interpreted in a positive way they're coming to save us
sometimes they were taken in a negative way of this is this is catastrophic this is judgment
like the the ufo colt that leon festinger studied in 1956 but uh what yung that this study is
fascinating um because he talks about visions and how prevalent they are and how much more
prevalent they are than the the the main sir yung was you know often uh he was able to get into
more esoteric areas where a lot of people wouldn't go at the time um and he gave some weird
interpretations to him but his discussion of visions uh is fantastic in that study um and he
talks about he describes him he says visionary rumors and it's either where the experience a
visionary experience had by somebody creates a kind of contagion effect that then spreads
and more and more people have these experiences or believe they have these experiences um and uh
or or vice versa the belief the the the stories that that are just rumors then create the experience
yep um and and that category of visionary rumors i think explains these sociological phenomenon like
religious movements that have these flurries of visionary experiences where there's a high
intensity expectation like the millerites like the joe's witnesses like uh uh um
the early jesus movement and apocalyptic movements like that but um
it's it what it's it's very similar to bereavement for visions where you have a high concentration
of experiences close together and then they kind of taper off um and you know then you have to explain
well okay you know so the oh the the apostle that jesus appeared at the 500 he he appeared to uh the
12 he appeared to peter and and then and what happened well luke says oh okay then he ascended
heaven and that's why people don't have those same experiences that they had back then but
i think that's that is a disintroduction strategy to try and explain the fact that these the the
frequency of these kinds of experiences isn't the same as it was early on because there was that
early psychological contagion that that that flurry of experiences that was visionary rumors of
did you hear about peter did you hear about james hey did you hear about the i heard there was
500 brothers they were all together at once and they had it and so and people are then expecting
that to happen and there's an excitement there's a vibrancy and then it becomes more established and
but there are many many stories about uh visions of the virgin mary that are the same kind of thing
where um this region uh a particular region will have this outbreak of visions of the virgin mary
where mary will appear to whole groups of people and they'll all think that they see mary um and and
and yet and but they don't last they they kind of there's a flurry of excitement and then
then it goes away again but yeah no this is interesting visions are really visions happen
all the time and you have to explain them somehow you brought up luke right i think that's important
pointing out the the uh mayus road story because in that story he's with them this might be an
apologetic to explain why he's always with you you can experience him but through the breaking
of the bread and the drinking so the eucharist i think is actually the point of that narrative
do you want to participate do you want to experience the god christ eat his flesh drink his blood
so here is the practice through which you can experience him and i'm not going to get lost
into like people who like the immortality key who think there might be psychedelics in it you
don't even need that to get people to you know but it could be i'm not going to say there weren't
possible groups other than that did it anyway um i don't want you hating me by the end because we
have more super chats is this okay that we try to get through these yeah we can go we can go a
little bit longer yeah let's try let's try and get through them let's try and get through them
because you and me need to do another episode where we're fully fresh and we can go in and
you're not hating me by the end of this do you have more info on how the writing of daniel
wasn't a total dishonest fraud been curious on the exact thought process of making that up
yeah i mean i would just i would say go read john j john j collins um is his work on daniel
is unparalleled he is the master of daniel his hermania commentary on daniel is still the best
it's like 20 20 years old and it's still the gold standard um but yeah i would say read john j
collins yeah and these guys don't think it's complete fraud uh they think that there's real
stuff going on like we've been talking about it exists within a tradition and in a community
that that has a different plausibility structure and a different way of evaluating those kinds of
things to where uh they're they weren't seen as being fraud i mean they're basically it's like
if it agrees with what i already believe then it's not a fraud if it doesn't agree with what
i already believe then it's a fraud right right thank you so much for that topic discuss gary
stone speaking of which we're going to have to figure out a time in the new year january february
to come fly you out to get your ex mormon story and of course get the history i want to do a series
with you um says paying my tides well thank you you know your loved ones will get to go out of
purgatory um it's okay you know we'll make sure you're you're taking care of gary seriously
though go subscribe to topic discuss i'm proud of gary he started his channel just last year and
boom he's growing and he's a good friend of mine thank you again uh bike x dynasty thanks for being
vulnerable means a lot means a lot thank you no paul cherry hi there i was wondering please
what do you think about brain filter theory that we can not fully comprehend reality
caused by our brain evolutionary developmental drive to keep surviving to spread our gene
i don't know anything about that specifically if that's a technical term brain filter theory
but from your description it sounds definitely like something i would i think makes a lot of sense
well i what came to my mind was like that because we're primates evolved on this planet that we just
don't have the that we didn't evolve to understand all reality right and so we evolved for what's useful
to us right to keep survival yeah right so to comprehend reality fully um in this evolutionary
process that we've gotten to today is just wishful thinking so there's hypotheses within like
philosophical thought and stuff i don't know paul cherry if i'm getting off track here but
if all we have are the faculties that we have and using methodologies that we can try to repeat
and duplicate scientific theory that is the best i can imagine we do to try and get to what the
reality of something is if we're speaking this language we all get an aliens come from somewhere
out of space let's just say since we're talking about UFOs earlier and these people are so smart
that we're like ants they don't understand our language because we're dumb and they're like hold
on like they're they're completely out of there but within their little group within their ant farm
they call earth like they actually are systematic and they they make reality in their world they live
in actually make pretty good sense um i would imagine that that that uh might be the case i
don't know but i wouldn't postulate that give up on trying to guess what reality is because
you're just not you didn't evolve to try and comprehend it and i think that's the that's
the whole point of the scientific revolution the whole point of scientific method is
what happens is as we human human communities human societies get to a point where we recognize
that we're all there there's there's a larger community we're rubbing shoulders with people
who have very different ideas about reality than we do and you know you have the protestant
reformation where um you know the the you recognize that the authority structures that
were defining reality for this whole western hemisphere the whole you know sizable chunk of
humanity was defining and according to these you know really shaky uh uh you know definitions of
of authority or their their their their plausibility structures were not solid and so
you know they're trying to go back find a better find a better foundation for belief but that
probing to try and find a better foundation just takes us deeper and deeper into the awareness
of our own biases and it's out of that process and out of rubbing shoulders with people
from completely different backgrounds from the east and from these places where they have totally
different ideas about reality well we have to figure out a way to try to circumvent to try to
curb these biases that that uh that make us see reality in all of these ways that aren't really
that that don't really get at that are that are more about survival
more about maintaining the cohesion of the community than they are about reality itself
and that's how the scientific the development of the scientific method really really began
was trying to answer those deeper questions to get behind that bias is to find a way to
uh to to to reach back but I think for that reason the scientific method will always stand
in tension and will always create dissonance for us as individuals with with with our desires and
with our with you know the the the the conservative bias to maintain uh the the you know maintain the
status quo because it will always buck against the status quo and it will always push against
that you know the the the the developmental drive to keep surviving to spread our genes that
that exists uh that causes us to see reality in ways that are useful for the maintaining of
our particular tribe but don't have long term uh uh you know to to whatever extent
they're not actually mapping on to reality they won't actually you know it's i i think of a helpful
image for me is like building a house on sand or building a house on ice it's like you know maybe
you want to fish in a hole in the ice and so you build your whole city on this ice and that is
expedient that is a way of uh of maintaining a community that that makes sense for a time but
eventually seasons are going to change that ice is going to thaw you build your house on the sand
eventually circumstances are going to change and what was expedient for your immediate survival
won't be expedient for your long-term survival and I think what we have learned is that
ultimately our different communities and our way of maintaining social cohesion that is beneficial
to our survival right now isn't always beneficial to our long-term survival as a species and so that
that propels us towards pushing against those biases that want to maintain social cohesion
maintain the conservative status quo and try to find solutions that will be
long-term beneficial to our survival as a species but those will those two things will always be
in tension with each other and we're not going to change our evolution and our our desire to have
our cozy little comfort comfortable you know community in the way things have always been
that's not going to go without a fight and we're going to live with that tension
hopefully hopefully we we make it through this filter and we come out the other side and we'll
still exist thank you paul i hope we answered your question katrina green thank you so much for the
super chat i really appreciate it i didn't see a comment by you in the chat and i like you like
how you explain that matt um we're almost done i got a couple more here oh we've got brad for bald
one good to see you in here modern apologetics is in essence applied cognitive dissonance the
use of musical terms solidifies this dissonance is the lack of harmony between notes apologetics
is the harmonizing of inconsistencies within scripture beautifully said wow that was poetic
someone clip there listen clip that um yeah i definitely really appreciate you matt again
let's get this thing wrapped up with saying go subscribe to matthew harks harky sorry i you know
what it's okay i said harky he's like harky i'm like okay go subscribe to his youtube channel
let's refresh us and see if we got you any subscribers since this great conversation today
you should and will get many more i predict it prophetically speaking so 2.52 yep hey we're
growing and by the time this episode is done i'll check back with it by tomorrow it makes me feel
good to know myth vision is growing other people's channels and getting you the exposure you have
deserved you have been chosen since the foundation of the world map for this very
so i uh any words about your youtube channel no this has been great man thank you so much for
the opportunity to come on this has been a really fun time i had last yes subscribe to him
and subscribe to our patreon it's as little as three dollars a month less than half of a starbucks
venti white chocolate mocha with extra drizzle okay and i had to add those extra words giving you
how important myth vision is please help us out i've got more stuff coming lots of videos
i'm editing and working on we've got courses that are coming up in 2023 i'm gonna be rolling out new
things and we do this all day every day like you used to in the community you were part of praying
and fasting so uh i really appreciate you man can we do can we do the outro of we are myth vision
absolutely i was gone that would make me feel like you know everything has been fulfilled
the kingdom has come like we've we've we have finality and resolution and the answer to the
problem of evil so would you like me to start like and this is how we pray yes yeah let's do
let's do so what i usually do my phrase my cultic phrase for myth vision isn't and this is how we
pray it is uh and in case you have forgotten or cognitive dissonance has got you by the gonads
never forget we are myth vision
so
you
