Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, today I have
Neil Boswell joining me for a heretic show. Welcome to the show my friend. Oh it's a pleasure,
always have fun. Absolutely, last show we did, you me and Derek Bennett, we had a blast, we
rabbitrowed a little off of Litwa and I know that he really wanted to deal with some of the
Hellenistic principles of how cross-cultural diffusion would take place and it wasn't a
one-way street, you know. This went both ways and I think we should have spent a little more
time for him on that. That was my only mistake but I thought we had a good time man, so. Who did?
In this one I figure, oh go ahead, sorry. I was saying I think we still ended up covering the
topic rather well because that is something that a lot of people unfamiliar with the subject matter
of comparative mythology and its influence on Christianity kind of overlook is how much
contact, direct contact that the Israelites did have with the Eastern cultures that's often used
as an apologetic was that they were shoved it off and I think we covered that topic pretty well.
Yeah I mean you can always go in depth and talk about stuff like where you see Zoroastrianism
in the Judaic religion or you find particular foreign influences and even an evolution of thought
within the Old Testament. You find Yahweh becoming the name of the primary deity of Israel where
there seems to be and he went by different names. Now you ask an Orthodox Jew of course
they're going to tell you oh no this is the same through and through and then more critical scholars
about a nice try but here's what we have developed and here's why. I respect both people but I
side with the critical because I see this as a piece of human literature that has evolved from
people's perceptions not even the same people necessarily that have evolved over a period of
time the same way I look at the New Testament. So I figured today what we could do is we'll
rabbithrow into some stuff but what helped me deconstruct with seeing parallels patterns weird
stuff you know astrological things like that stuff never played a part in my Christianity.
Why didn't we talk about the 12 12 people the 12 tribes the 12 disciples the 12 hours in a day
the 12 zodiac signs um numerical values celestial bodies other deities um for crying out loud
Sampson the sun god okay like you know these things were a manly peahall blew the lid off my head
a few times uh when I'd listened to his lectures back in the day he's one of those guys the no
matter how old that recording is I can listen to manly peahall and and he's so articulate explaining
these things it just blows my mind so I have a satellite view understanding of a lot of this
um whereas you can look at some trees inside of the forest and that's why I'm glad I have you
joining me brother oh yeah yeah I look forward to it um yeah it's it's very stimulating um
kind of pulling off of that um and talking about the cross-cultural influences on Palestine and
how that led to the development of Christianity um one important aspect that didn't touch on too much
in the last episode was um as you mentioned astrology and more importantly astronomy uh kind
of divorced from a lot of the boo boo because that you know when they didn't have clocks and
hand digital calendars and um reminders and alarms on their cell phones back in the day
the only thing they had to go by to um enumerate the patterns of their lives was the stars um and
I think that's another thing that's greatly overlooked in its contribution to the development
of the Christian myth um especially when Palestine was conquered by Babylon because I think of all
those Near Eastern European and North African cultures it was Babylon that really developed the
most sophisticated astronomical system that has the the root of which has streamed down to us today
it's where we it's what we base our modern zodiac system on is the old Babylonian system
with the uh 12 now 13 of course uh signs but um whereas a lot of the other cultures I know uh
sometimes when you bring up this kind of subject matter um a lot of the cultures from that time
get completed like people will try to say that the Egyptians had a 12 signs zodiac they actually
didn't in their indigenous astronomy uh that was another thing that they borrowed from the
Babylonians as well but nevertheless um in this tornado of a multicultural influence with
Palestine kind of you're actually being at the center of it they couldn't help but be
influenced by those things as well I wonder if prior to the Hellenistic age there was influenced
by Babylon on Egypt because Horus if I'm not mistaken and I'm look there's there's some
really fringe I feel like we've got some type of clicky noise do you hear something or is that just
me I don't hear anything yet okay maybe it's just me um but Horus you know I've heard some some
people that do this kind of talk that we're going to kind of talk today that do go really too far
I mean to a point where um there was no Israelite people okay there's some people who go so far
now I get the idea of the myth making of 12 tribes have a numerical significance that might be
borrowed from the Athenians or the Greeks uh and their way their ways of being tens and
twelves they had a systematic approach in which people would govern monthly they would switch
their priorities or they'd have tribes distinguish tribes that would have priority in certain areas
but there are certain people that might go so far as to say nothing in the bible has any
historical significance it's all astrology or something like astronomy or something and there's
no meat on the bone um and I'm not convinced of that at all but at the same time I'm not trying to
throw them out and be bashy like everyone's like you gotta think like me no we're gonna do a little
bit of flexible thought one of the things I heard on a show a long time ago and I can't remember
the gentleman's name um he's a well-known astro theology guy and um he's like really on the
fringe area but he he said that the uh pit uh what is it called s I can't even think the where
the root words um etymology I don't know why I had a brain fart there um the etymology of
horus if you just change the h and you put it here you have hours and he said that's why
there were 12 horuses in the sky 12 hours now that sounds interesting it does because when
you go to Jesus he says there's 12 hours in a day and there's some weird stuff there that you could
maybe pull off of um how significant is it is a huge question mark yeah so the the idea of
12 horuses in the sky connected 12 hours not saying there couldn't be a connection there
but I think you went so far as to say the etymology in English is where we get all this from you
you know like it all still found its way through language and found us where horus is h o r u s
and if you move the the uh what is it the uh it's it's hours yeah move the r over and you've got
yeah uh hours yeah this sounds a lot like Jordan Maxwell is that who you think that's
that's who it was man yeah and so I think he goes too far in many many ways and then everything
is pessimistic too like the outlook of everybody rules there's secret people rolling and like
it's this like I mean and he people might say you're gullible for thinking that but
no there's too much weird conspiratorial stuff for me to get into that personally
but uh what do you what do you think about some of this uh you want to jump off on um yeah I I'm
not big on the etymologies like that myself although there are some interesting uh correlations
but not being well studied into linguistics myself I can't really comment on that I only
know English but yeah I do um I do find it fascinating I think it's very significant to
observe where star patterns took an influence on these things um you had mentioned you know
12 horses I haven't heard that in particular myself but they're being 12 different horses but
you do find repeated imagery throughout the tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt
where a horse is depicted with 12 figures often they are explicitly stated to be his servants
followers um sometimes they are said to be the servants of followers of his father Osiris who
he delegated to Horace after his death um other times they are said to be 12 enemies of Osiris who
Horace is taking to judgment and uh so yeah over and over again you constantly see um visual imagery
of Horace with 12 male figures following after him that's interesting because my point with all
that was you were talking about how the Egyptians borrowed from the Babylonians their calendar
which makes sense um and these numbers though play a part in the in their time keeping uh and
the idea of there being 12 zodiac signs and 12 is a significant number in their way of measurement
of time I saw 12 Horace or 12 people following of Osiris or whatever uh I wondered if that was
way back in the old dynasty or if this you know what I mean yeah well the 12 the categories 12
ancient Egypt who does predate their acquisition of the Babylonian zodiac system um that was more
specifically for the dividing of those those constellations into 12 for the for the sun
but the theme of 12 in particular yeah it's it's it goes all the way back to the old king in Egypt
perhaps even earlier but we definitely haven't documented you know the old kingdom onward
where it's more uh correlated with the 12 months and that's the 12 cycles of the moon within a solar
year yeah dude take me wherever you want to go with this because we're talking calendar but there's
just I honestly we can go anywhere the idea of where 365 day year comes up you know uh
three is 360 divided by five is a 72 which you know we go into the number 72 you find strange
places where there's always a council of 70 71 or 72 found within scripture uh you can go into
imagery you can go into like who constellations where it doesn't matter I'm gonna follow you on this
yeah absolutely um yeah just like when um was it I think it may have been Plutarch in his summation
of you know Cyrus Smith he says that when uh Seth was conspiring to assassinate Osiris that he did
so with 72 inspirators of course in the case of Jesus where he was betrayed by Judas with the
Sanhedrin the Sanhedrin was composed of 72 sources vary some Jewish sources say it was 70 but some
do say it was 72 so that like that's an interesting correlation there um as you had mentioned one
place that that comes from is um astrologically speaking one place that comes from is from the
ancient Egyptian Deccanal system which I'm not sure if your viewers are familiar with that but
the ancient Egyptians they divided their weeks into 10 days because they had a certain star system
the Deccanal star system where there was a certain um every 10 days a certain star would appear above
the horizon again as far as I understand it I was trying to repeat it off the top of my head as best
I can remember it but um yeah so then that that caused them to have a year of 36 weeks of 10 days
as you said which totals to 360 days and then those five days left over in the solar year
they called their epigaminal days which they didn't attribute to any month it was kind of like
the leaked days of the year so to speak which they put at the very end of the calendar
and that was the days when the primary gods were born but um yeah as you said when you take their
36 weeks of 10 days and divide those in half and you get 72 the Ordo Deccans instead of Deccans
so that's one place that comes from and you do find that represented in Egyptian artwork
in the tombs as well I forget which tomb it is off the top of my head I'm gonna say it's one of
the ranzies but there's a depiction on a pillar a standalone pillar of just 72 gods and when you
look at their names it's the 72 primary gods of ancient Egypt like you got Osiris, Isis, Horus,
Nephys, and it was they're all lined up and the inscription beneath it says these are all 72 different
manifestations of the sun god rey so you know and and um in the gospels I think it's in Luke it says
that although Jesus had his primary disciples he had a verge group of 72 followers who he sent out
in pairs so you keep finding these correlations the sun god here with 72 followers and then
a solar deity here with 22 followers it's weird you say that because when he talked about the
five days set aside manly p-hall you know he's a well-known freemason but he's obviously well
adept in symbolism and recognizing uh things that the average joe would not look at these texts
and look for uh he actually helped me kind of balance my view because I used to think the
idea of the sun god being jesus right or the god of israel was the sun itself um he was the guy who
was like no no no no no they didn't believe that was the sun they thought the god behind the sun
was you know so he kind of helped me with that because I kept thinking well
egypt just looked at the sun as god but they also had a lot of times not always they also had multiple
gods and so did ancient israel in many ways but uh anyway the five that idea of the five is so
significant I think he mentioned that the Torah being five books uh on purpose may have a calendar
significance to the additional five uh extra days in the calendar year uh also our vows you
know he says it's five but technically it's secretly seven for being perfect because technically you
have a eio you he says and sometimes if I'm not mistaken x and y I don't even know what the damn
secret vows are um I'm so out of grammar but the idea was there's five primary and two hidden
and if you look at the 70 like you keep them on 70 and 72 in the old story with moses I remember
it's just something about like there were 70 elders with moses and then it literally stops
him like pauses and says and then there were two in the city so it's like why are you attaching these
extra two here uh didn't they also at one point had five major planets uh I can't remember yes in the
in the old um old world uh system as far as the uh planets that you can see with a naked eye I think
it is five planetary bodies and then if you include the sun and the moon it um seven and the earth
yeah sun and the moon for seven and then the earth itself for eight was where you get like
plate those eight celestial realms um yeah that's very interesting I had never heard that before
where you um stated earlier um there were five primary and then two secondary because that may
be what's alluded to in the gospels where Jesus had the um five loaves and the two fishes so yep
so yeah I love that though once you see this you it really makes you have to ask is this real
literal history you have to say is this symbolism for something is it code for something else is
there something else going on and the more the patterns start to be recognizable the more you
have to as an honest human say uh is this what kind of genre am I dealing with here right question
the foundation of how you approach in these texts and I used to say wow god is so like when it said
he moved these men and the holy spirit guided them he wasn't kidding like like this is literally
down to the like details of hidden secret codes and like all that kind of stuff and maybe that's
what's implied by the authors themselves when it talks about their move by the holy spirit
but they were initiated they were well aware of the secret knowledge that only those who are able
to see with eyes and ears to hear can be aware of and it's not this weird strange like uh they may
have equated the two but it's not this weird strange like uh today I can go to a church and
that someone just lays their hand on me and somehow I get the strange abstract no you were taught in
the mysteries someone taught you and you know you were learning these things but I I think that's
interesting the five and then the two you know yeah absolutely five uh weekdays and then your
your two days for the weekend um yeah yeah that's that was fascinating I never heard that up to that
point but now that you say that yeah a few references in the bible to such numerology combined um yeah I
wonder why that is um I was going to bring up another point of um interest about numerology
and skating at the moment but um where'd you want to go next I mean if you want I can tackle a couple
more little numbers before we move into like more concrete uh stories things like that the 144,000
which I mentioned in the last show I think briefly which is just a very interesting thing because
it comes down to the number nine ultimately nine is a special significant number one plus four plus
four is nine uh you can do some really strange stuff when you calculate and start uh and I'm not
going to waste all my time in the mathematics of of like why I think they saw it sacred but they
looked at nature it came down to nature and the numbers we use came from nature you know we have
five hand five fingers they say we have five senses according to manly p hall and then he says there
are two that you can't you don't recognize that are there and it's a really weird statement to make
I'm you know I'm a very skeptical person but I have to admit there have been times that are strange
when I've sensed I guess like there was a problem and I knew maybe I'm picking up uh pheromones maybe
there's a scientific explanation I don't know uh but like I had felt something was wrong
and come to find out something was wrong and yeah I was like what so is it is it some type of sense
that we once could have picked up a long time ago that is still with us somewhat like an earthquake
coming or tsunami animals hit the hills and we're here still enjoying the beach not recognizing
back in the day we might have known something was coming I don't know but uh it just makes me wonder
scientifically on that uh yeah yeah I'd say that's definitely the part of intuition um it doesn't
necessarily have to invoke any kind of like a sixth sense so to speak for the viewers who are more
skeptical in mind but I think a great explanation of how intuition works in the level in the sense
that you're talking about um was by uh um was it orson wells who did um the um the war of the
world's radio broadcast oh there's a fantastic clip of him on youtube and one of his um interviews he
did later in his career like in the 70s where he talked about how he used to be a cold reader psychic
a fake psychic and he said um I actually got pretty good at it where he and I couldn't logically
assess the details that were there with my ego but my intuition just picked up on it I would guess
things that ended up being like uncannily accurate and he said the way I think it works is how like
say you take on an occupation as being a night clerk and you're taught how to assess customers
that come in and then you tell them oh I'm sorry we have no vacancies or yes right this way sir
and he goes if you've been like night clerk long enough maybe a few months maybe a year all you have
to do is give a quick glance you don't have to do the full scan you've been a night clerk even longer
you don't even have to look up just by the hearing the way they walk and hear in their voice you know
what kind of person this is going to be and if it's you know your clientele and he goes that's
the way I think the cold reading and intuition in general works yeah that's interesting because I
try to go with what I can know that's that's where I'm at you know I want to know what I can know
but the 144 I was mentioning nine with a half of 144 is 72 which weirdly enough goes into all these
numbers yeah um yeah I'm great uh you said that because you reminded me what I wanted to say earlier
which was that another place where the significance of the number 72 comes in we'd mentioned where it
came in through the egyptian system in the greek system I believe it's um plenty the elder who had
said in the first century that at that time that he was living um the number of stars that have
been documented in the sky were 1600 and they were divided in total into 72 different constellations
so um that's another place where that comes in and so yeah in revelation where you see the number
144 pop up you can't help but wonder and especially since the author says this will show him as a sign
in heaven if he's not talking about some kind of star system going on right something's going on
there and I think that could be also significant with the 144 that we find of the virgin israelites
and you know there's all sorts of strange stuff with uh measurement that can go into this I had
a guy who was in a sacred geometry that came on and like he really knows his stuff dude it was like
mind-boggling how he knew measurements and uh he had checked out a lot of uh buildings in history
cathedrals things that you can like what and then measurements for 144 whether it was a roman foot
whether it was an egyptian foot whether you know he found the in their system of measurement they
wanted to use these particular numbers and you got to go why uh is this just myth added on to real
history uh or mythologized history and how can we know what's what that's the tough part and so
I look at that and I'm just like wow I remember him pointing out that in epic of gilgamesh the cube
that saved him from destruction uh the ziggurat I believe it was uh the measurement uh on the square
value of the face of the ziggurat was 144 000 which is like interesting because I think the
same thing is said of the new jerusalem temple in revelation uh really really weird numbers but uh
and then 144 cubits is 216 feet so here we are again with two plus one which is three plus six
which is nine here we are with nine again in mathematics and there's just a lot of interesting
things and we can jump off of this topic here because last thing I'll say is the 153 fish
which is pythagorean at least in some way they think there's a pythagorean hint here in the
gospel narrative um you know the 153 uh you know do do the math here you know um you have nine
not only is it a nine number but it's a perfect uh triangular uh number so if you add one plus two
plus three plus four plus five all the way up to 17 I think or 19 literally in sequential order and
you have 153 so it literally ends up a perfect geometrical number why the hell is that in the
gospels right like come on well who who thought let me put the five fish and the two loaves what
are you trying to say my friend exactly and the thing about that is I'm sure you encounter this too
in your days as a christian I had to find a candidate amongst fellow church members and other
christians is that they do love biblical numerology as long as you keep it within the context of just
the scriptures itself is when you start making the correlations to cultures outside of the bible
and they sort of have a problem till this day you're right till this day on the top of the indonesian
in indonesia the largest buddhist temple in the world there's 72 buddhas 72 why what the heck are
you guys trying to do is this some world conspiracy you know it is kind of weird that pyramids are on
every continent man uh that's just a strange phenomena right and yeah I don't think it necessarily
has to be um a conspiracy so to speak I mean every every country under the sun as they say has access
to the stars can see the sky and so I'm sure there's some kind of correlation there like I've often
heard that I'm not too well studied in um uh the american mythologies of like north and south america
central america and so forth but I have heard that there is a lot of correlation a lot of um pagan
parallels do I say between um the Aztec mythology of their god kethical waddle and those of like say
the egyptian goddess cyrus or even some loose parallels to jesus so you have to wonder like how
a culture that could not have possibly had any contact with um you know europe and the near east
has so many striking parallels that that seem so striking they can't be coincidence why is that
well they also could look at the stars and could chart out the numbers what was going on in the
cycle everything and thus produce similar myth structure that makes me think nail that that not
only are they looking at the same night sky dr price said that on a recent interview when I asked him
what he learned from acharya s and this new book that he helped edit that's been released a christ
conspiracy um but you know it's not just about looking at the same night sky it's we have the same
hardware as other uh the software might be a little different but the hardware is the same
the reality is you're a human on that side of the planet i'm a human on this side
you're both it's going to be it's all nature right so uh your women are going to act probably very
much alike there's going to have that there's a natural thing set in tone so the way that women
act the way men respond the way we just are as creatures uh there's going to be a lot anthropomorphic
if you will uh placed onto and i think in a oral sense in an oral culture where things aren't
literacy so you don't compartmentalize everything in your mind it's all what you see is what you get
and it's like you face the day as the days they are in front of you um i think it would be really
simple to say it's easy to see why a lot of similar themes show up there could be literary
parallels and things that might have but i don't necessarily have to say um atlantis
was the original civilization of all mankind where all this was taught and everybody sat
on a big round table and then the gods were pissed because some immorality or pride boasted these
people and the gods said no more he sent the waters i mean that's a narrative maybe describing
prehistory civilization of some place or somewhere maybe that could be i'm not going to
rule out the myth could be based on true history i told my wife this one time and now we're getting
off into some interesting stuff but i was sitting eating in a mexican restaurant chips and salsa
just enjoying i was starving and i said honey i was thinking hard apps she's probably thinking
what a freaking weirdo but uh i said uh can you imagine in 40 000 years if civilization ends up
having a restart we go back to scratching sticks and stones and we build back up right learning
how to agricultural all over again i mean imagine we that we're out of touch i mean imagine only
imagine some people survive and all this technology goes to waste and they say on one of those
documentaries after 10 000 years the only things left will be things in stone and then 40 000 years
from now there's a person sitting in a restaurant with his wife and he says have you ever heard the
story of america that's a myth i mean imagine if we've done this before you know what i'm saying
like it just blows my mind man yeah i'm not trying to get too weird or anything i'm just saying like
i don't know oh no yeah and you there's definitely some good researchers out there who explore those
kind of more i guess um fringe theories yeah there's some compelling there's some compelling
evidence um obviously you know more mainstream research has some problems with that but but
if you give it a chance there's some compelling arguments made in there i'm not saying they had
computers and like flying satellite i'm just saying they were probably somewhat better off than what
we saw 9 000 years ago yeah there's no telling though i don't know right right of course um
but yeah uh and you're mentioning that the only things that are going to be left are going to be
stone um that's probably why we find in a lot of these megalithic structures the um
numerological correlations that you've been mentioning like even you know with the buddhas
the 70 buddhas you know or um again with the pyramid stones or you know stone hinge um even
you find that even in modern examples i believe i've heard that the hoover dam uh the date that it
was constructed or the date that it was completed actually um is um indented into the concrete of
the hoover dam but in star system talk like it's not written in our english you know roman numerals
um it's um written um a chart so that future generations if like you said if we ever had
a reset button on humanity and they lost all the knowledge that we have they can still look at the
stars and use the star chart on the hoover dam to determine when it was completed wow because
because yeah it's like even the engineers of the dam knew that this thing's gonna last so long
that one day you know somebody's gonna stumble upon it who doesn't have you know a computer or
a phone to whip out and figure out when it was made gosh that'd be crazy if that ever happens
no but that's interesting and then of course most of the builders run off of the same system
they're probably masonic in nature and they've built a lot of this stuff you know and i mean
we're going off into a different arena here but it is interesting stuff and i think it does
find its way connecting to the temples the temple cult uh genesis uh being a a temple creation
i think genesis one is is a temple creation narrative uh of the cosmological but not just
cosmological there's the microcosm of actual temple i would suggest uh that might be going on
here and this this is probably patterns throughout all ancient near eastern type temple significant
stories if you will i just interviewed john knight lennwall last night i love the guy man
he's just all over and he's talking about oral people and how they thought they had the same
hardware but different software and he went and showed parallels between like the curse of the
the man the woman and the serpent and then being found naked and then you go to noah getting found
naked by his son uh and then like be fruitful multiply that's what god said in genesis one here
after the flood and the same thing said in lots time you know when the fire comes so
there's just so many things to rabbitrell here but i didn't know if you want to talk about stuff
like that or if you want to get into samson real quick uh that that one blew my mind i
loved that story growing up i thought there was a real guy like hercules but this was the real
story not the fake one this is the samson really really happened you know until you even as a
christian you can pull out your uh strong's concordance and look up the original hebra meaning
of the word samson and it means of the sun like in your own you know your own church and literature
that says his name literally means of the sun so it's like the name is trying to tell you something
there and then i believe yeah he's the uh 12th judge um oh that's a good question the judges of
israel i think he's yeah he's like the 12th judge and although the chapter divisions of book of
judges came later i believe his story is in the 12th chapter of the book of judges really and then
of course he is he's the judge of israel he's the judge over 12 tribes so yeah you constantly get this
you know uh solar numerology with uh the story interesting uh i'm trying to find that i was
gonna look for that just to see the reference for the 12th judge but maybe i i don't know that's
an interesting thing i never i never thought about that i do like the fact that it's pretty clear
once you once you have the decoder ring so to speak uh you could see his seven locks on his head
represent the seven days of the week but there's more probably layers to that than just the seven
days of the week but the idea that his hair represents the rays of light right and we mentioned
earlier that the seven visible planetary bodies of the you know ancient solar system yeah because
i think they would connect all this the seven days of the week are named after these celestial
bodies too so you gotta imagine these days are celestial in nature by their very naming uh and
then of course you start to look at the idea that delilah comes on she's offered silver which if you
get into that and try to explain what silver would mean or could possibly mean i would think
lunar uh it could be very lunar in nature but the idea that the it's probably an eclipse type language
or um it could just be that the moon is about to cut the sun off and here the moon's going to gain
power and uh and then the sun is going to go down into the winter solstice because hair gets cut
off after the third time which is another interesting point it's exactly in the kind of
trail just a little bit yeah please fine you had mentioned and we all see this when when
kids bring up in church the correlations between samson and hercules
regionally of course he's the strong guy with the long hair who wears a lion or kills a lion
whatever whatever have you you know you kind of see this it's like oh okay this is the google
version of hercules you know and uh we don't really have a problem with it where even as christians
you know she's going oh yeah okay that's interesting but um there is a little known adventure of
hercules because it's a little known because it's not included in his 12 main trials that everybody
knows is the popular um um telling of the hercules story um where he is uh sent to rescue the lady i
believe her name is called octastes and um in the course of the adventure he gets followed by a sea
monster for three days and when he's regurgitated all of his hair fell off so oh my gosh bro this
sounds like a comic book but it's funny it's very much like jonah combined with samson in a sense
exactly you know that's weird yeah that that was like the third time that the lion had tried to
remove his his strength and then finally she removes his hair and then after the third day
hercules comes out and then all his hair falls off so it's like and as you said there's probably
some lunar correlation there because um it is during the three days of the new moon phase that you
know the the moon sort of emerges with the sun or that's when it's on the same side of the earth
as the sun and that's why we can't see the moon for those three days and then when they
blind up perfectly is when we get the eclipse that you mentioned so yeah i think so i think there's
some reference to like the solar lunar conjunction as they call it i thought it was fascinating
in light of all that she cuts his hair and the first thing they do when they bind him or pretty
much they now have power over the sun if you look at it like that is they gouge his eyes out for
darkness this is the idea of now you can't see so the significance to an anthropomorphized story
that has deep rich meaning you can you can close your eyes and see the samson story
and they gouge his eyes out and now he has to work in the basement grounding mill and notice
that's when you store for the winter solstice he's now working in the middle or if you will the sun
is now working below the horizon where you can't see it uh is the kind of picture that could possibly
be going on and uh what happens well they go out they go out to mock him which is making it very
personified in light of they're against those who are of the day gone i believe it's the day gone
temple here not ball but uh it could be mistaken one or the other but i think it was day gone
and the fish god but he goes to the day gone temple and sure enough it's like the hairs coming back
baby boom and drops the temple um that's interesting you mentioned i didn't even um um while i knew that
i didn't even think about that aspect of it that day gone was a fish god and the other story again
we have hercules being swallowed by the fish monsters so interesting he's swallowed by the
temple too so i don't he dies in the temple uh by killing the number like 3000 or something uh
3000 and something day gone worshipers that were on the temple as he pushes the pillars apart but
there might be some i mean i guarantee you there's so much here if i were to actually take my time
to research and dig i could probably correlate the whole story to something significant or i'd be
probably speculative at places uh the same way that the the idea that uh what the zeitgeist movie
does to try and explain the three kings which it's not said is three kings that come to jesus's
birth they think those are either orions belt lining up with serious to the to the sun rising on
horizon after the winter solstice or something it to me it's interesting but it is speculative
even though it makes a lot of sense it's speculative so everything we're doing here is
somewhat speculative but it makes a lot of sense if that makes any of there also are there is a lot
of iconography from the roman era of the um helonized version of horus which is called
our properties um it's usually a horse depicted as an infant human with the egyptian side lock
there's a lot of iconography usually on like stone gems and magical amulets that show him being
greeted by sets of three gods they're not always the same three gods sometimes they're just egyptian
like the three forms of the sun god atum re and three but on the greco roman side of sometimes
he's often visited by three greek gods and only three and yeah there's just like baby horse there
and then and then there's a star above him and and then you have uh like uh zeus and hecate and
hera showing up to greet the baby horse while he's under a star wow dude so you're telling me foreign
gods would come and and greet which is weird because i always had this weird question when
christians would ask or tell the story of the three wise men which it doesn't say three but you
kind of wonder why the tradition even is that it's three uh and you look and you see these are not
jews these are not israelites it's foreign persian kings uh or you know what i mean uh magi i mean
either they're persian or they're babeloni but i think they're persian if i'm not mistaken
and they're coming to greet the newborn son of israel like son of god that's weird yeah yeah um
definitely that that definitely seems to be a callback by the the the gospel to the time that
the jews were in captivity under babelon and that's when they improved all this astronomical
knowledge and so i think it was kind of like giving a shout out to like when the the fusion
came in of like jewish uh eschatology along with babelonian astronomy that even like the
babelonian astronomers were able to use their song correlate with hebra prophecy you know
this is once again a two-way street two-way street
absolutely sorry you were gonna take it somewhere you broke up
actually i was just gonna um comment um yeah it's true that the the new testament doesn't
explicitly say that the uh magi were free in number but it does say they gave three gifts so
i mean based on that loan you can you can see why it later developed into it being free magi
i mean in every bit of visual iconography that we have left of the epiphany i think is what that
had been is typically called in church terminology um the epiphany is always shown visually as it
being free magi not like five or seven or even three in a number so that's interesting i mean so
to me it doesn't matter i mean the three gifts the three three magi if it's celestial in nature
it still could be a ryan's bow it's not like it has to be no that's us men not not gifts okay well
or vice versa i think that's great i love that stuff what do you think about acharya as oh go ahead
oh it's gonna say i mean yeah these things are so multi-faceted it's never just one thing and i
think that's often where like a lot of christian apologists want to try to hammer hammer us you
know is they want to like really pigeonhole just one aspect of the development of a myth
and say no it could have been this other thing actually it's all the above so go ahead no i was
gonna say acharya s she uh she had an interesting comment on john the baptist and the jesus uh colt
and one of the things i thought was interesting and i wanted your thoughts on this maybe it's
something in the greek that seems more apparent but uh i must increase while he must decrease
or i must decrease while he increases that john the baptist is going down and jesus is supposed to
come up as the sun um i can't remember what she quotes him i think he's the aquarius water bearer
or something like that in this scenario do you recall um i don't recall that exactly
and being correlated with aquarius i do recall her saying that it's um likely that john the
baptist correlates with the summer solstice and jesus with winter solstice that's right um because
i think even the chronology as laid out in the gospel luke in the nativity narrative says that
they were born six months apart john and jesus right um yeah yeah uh i'm glad you actually
brought up john the baptist because this is something that was in my head in the previous
episode we did that i wanted to mention and we never quite got around to it but when jesus asks
the disciples in the gospels who didn't say that i am and they tell him well some people say you're
the christ other people say you're the baptist and then they go and say and some people say you're
lygeo or lycho one of the other prophets has died and now been resurrected and then elsewhere in the
gospels we find that herod actually was one of the people who bought into that that gossip that
jesus was just a form of john the baptist risen from the dead and i think that's rather significant
because that means even if we humor the new testament chronology as being like 100 percent
like literal trust for the historical or whatever we were we're granting that christian position of
like the new testament gave us 100 accurate history on this then that means that even within
new testament chronology there was already a room floating around that jesus christ rose from the
dead before he actually rose from the dead therefore if jesus the man if he ever was a man if he died
and did not actually rise from the dead it makes a difference because the rumor
was already circulating at the time now that's you know one of those things to me critical
critical thought would make me of course look at things like uh jesus tells his disciples uh
take up your cross and follow me what you're not even you haven't died on your cross yet why are you
saying you know there's weird stuff that just doesn't make sense if this is literally being said
during the life of jesus uh but then of course christ is gone oh no he knew how he was gonna die
and he knew where and he knew when and uh you know there's just i think at what point do you
finally stop and go ladies and gentlemen uh let's see if there's history here but uh the genre
approach is a very important one i think we need to reevaluate is this historical fiction that's
the important part and then when you grant historical fiction that can include astronomical
significance that can include allegorical approaches that can include real concrete
possible things but you gotta find that you don't start with that you have to you have to look for
that and not assume it uh just looks and appears to you that this sounds historical um that same
method isn't used when christians read hercules they you know and i'm not talking about liberal
christians that are obviously more open-minded to not inerrant infallible approaches to the to the
bible i'm talking to talking to the the inerrant infallible people the ones like that were just
like me at that point you should really say all right i need to take a scientific approach and
try and find actual concrete and actual historical significance instead of us starting with the
assumption and this is what old testament scholarship used to do they started with well how
old does the old testament say it is okay then that's how old it is and then until we're proven
otherwise we need to and it's like uh now you have what are called minimalists that say look
what is the absolute guaranteed physical evidence we have of the oldest that the old testament is
the heber bible right and they start with that and they work trying to assume can we speculate
that it's any older i don't care if it says it's 80 000 year old story you don't believe it because
it says that you know you have to you have to give good concrete reasons so they start with
more of a scientific approach and that to me would be the way to approach the new testament
but it's sacred it's the no no you're not supposed to you're not supposed to do that you know yeah
yeah exactly i think that's yeah that's a very important point is the categorization because
then that sets the tone for how you're gonna continue to fill the data on the subject from
that point onward and that's the thing is that when you read the gospels as as they're laying
out in the new testament and and then you compare that with other literature circulating at the time
for and shortly after that the kind of genre it falls into is yes like you said historical fiction
in particular of the like kind of romance novel type um dr price that you've had on your show before
he um makes the fantastic point of uh the main point in the gospels about the passion of jesus
are also found in two very popular novels that were circulating around prior to
the time that jesus and the ambassadors have performed their ministry and those were um karrot
thons uh kalir away and uh keenathon's um effusion tale both of which have a protagonist who has a
bride who is prematurely buried she's mistaken as dead and then she uh uh tomb is invaded by
tomb robbers and as these rides are reviving they kidnapped the bride and then when the
protagonist comes to find the empty tomb with his own old way they say oh my god she's had a
resurrection and been taken up in the heaven by the gods and then as the protagonist goes to find
his lost bride he in the course of the events is crucified and miraculously saved from the
crucifixion and these like again these were circulating just decades prior to when the
hospital released so okay so you set the tone all right you did set the tone there that's a good
one so so with that i forget to mention this to bob but uh you know it is my opinion behind the
greek myths behind this myth the hebra myths even the story you just told all right it is my
assumption and maybe this is a false assumption to begin with uh but i i'm just gonna start with it
i think behind these stories even if there is some concrete there they base them off of
the cycles they base them off of strange uh ways of approaching the sun going down into the earth
um and maybe that's just because i see patterns between the sun representing a hero that that has
to battle and you know that maybe i've read too much uh material on the hero with a thousand faces
but uh you know just looking at stuff that way makes me think even behind this i mean i can
connect my own experience with my issues with my wife in the past and the struggles we've had in this
love uh that we've had in the in the relationship struggles and the bad and the life and death of
people that we've had around us all that and connect it to more sacred things sacred holy things
and the holy things are me and my wife alone it's the the heavens and and the bodies that that are
around uh that help us keep track of time things that are permanent they didn't look up in the sky
and say oh that'll pass away one day after about seven billion you know that was the eternal so
they connected on earth as it was in heaven or as above so below in many of these stories
and i think the later you get it appears the story catches your eye so much you don't see the
possibility of the behind of it the sacred which might be the celestial uh playing its role in the
narrative yeah absolutely i think that's a good summation of it that it's like the mythology or
at least our classic mythology our most popular mythology is a fusion between our environment
our nature our stars or whatever and the archetypal hero's journey that is wired in our you know our
brain the DNA of our brain um yeah you because you can find uh fiction that follows the pattern of
the hero's myth that is entirely divorced from anything astronomical and vice versa you can
find you know anthropomorphized astronomy that doesn't necessarily follow the hero uh the
your journey pattern but it's our most popular myths our most uh um um our tales that stand
at test of time so to speak such as the gospels such as the osiris aniseus such as you know
the tales of the greek gods and so forth those are the ones that follow this fusion of both
right and they're always going to be with us i think they will uh what else nil let's see what
else do you want to ravage rel into my friend um let's see um you know one point i wanted to make
a little earlier was um how you said how do we divorce the um the possibly historical elements
and these things from what is just purely like either just pure storytelling or just pure symbolism
of the astronomy and whatnot and that's yeah that's another factor that that has to be looked at when
you're trying to dissect these things because you can find these myths incorporated into the
biographies of people who we know for a fact we're historical that we all do universally
regardless historical such as the caesar's you know such as um um like say caesar alexander the great
you know there's a lot of the same archetypal imagery in his biography that are added added into
as time goes on as the legend begins to you know extend beyond just the man himself and we often
find supernatural and fantastic elements incorporated into their biographies many of which
follow these archetypal patterns and do also work in a lot of astrology like i know that um
there's one version of the the um the omen of the conception of julia sees involved some kind of um
star or something yeah some kind of star with um and quarreling with um rising in venus i think
is worked in there somewhere um and again that's an element that his attitude is biography after the
fact of like a couple centuries after um his lifetime but nevertheless it shows that these
things are worked into the narratives of genuinely historical people so how do we make that distinction
because if we can find you know allegorized star patterns in the myths hercules or of julia sees
her or of jesus uh as you mentioned earlier it's a matter of categorization we find a lot of um
historical evidence uh for the life and existence of julia sees her that is entirely divorced from
any of these fantastical elements that are in his narrative we can't say the same about the
hercules or jesus any bit of quote alleged historical evidence we find for either those two
guys is intimately tied in with the fantastic and mythical elements of their stories you don't
ever find you know minted coins of jesus um actually you find some coins of hercules but
but um they are clearly um mythologized like you could tell that the context of the depiction
of hercules on the coin you know it's like him holding a line of his club and he's getting
he's getting ready to bash the line that's one of his 12 labors you know so it's still intimately
tied in with his mythology whereas in the case of like julie sees you'll find coins depicting him
crossing uh what was the type the the type of thing rubicon thank you um yeah um things that
are tied in with his historical narrative not within the mythologize mythologize bits of his
narrative right and i think that he you know still doesn't negate the possible reality of
someone existing uh because there's other so many other factors you could play in like his class
if he was some backwoods galilean or something you're not gonna probably find much about anyone
coming from the areas he came from uh with with the similar things that are said about him because
he's not a Caesar he's not somebody that's uh someone we have an imprint imprint of the on the
world in some archaeological way from the con contemporary time in which he exists but when
it you mentioned something that was complex because it's difficult with me in my mind i
listed the scholars on both ends where one might say no this is a complete fictional tale here
and another one to go no that's historical could it be both possibly but you you then have to use
other tools to figure it out like dr airman for a long time believed that there was a real missing
body from a real tomb uh where uh women went to the tomb and there's jesus missing and he would
debate christians about the empty tomb and how the resurrection's not feasible and all that
well he actually has backtracked dr price said and i don't know where the writings are on this but
i know i think recently william lane craig came at him for this and um oh dr price changes his
mind or not dr price dr airman changes his mind dr price said that he um he once thought this was
a real narrative and now he thinks it's a legend so you know what led him to finally go you know
they really didn't walk up to an empty tomb and say where's the body of jesus what okay that kind
of makes me go how much magnifying glass did he have on it to make that assumption or were there
reasons in his debates with people that he realized you know why am i arguing this point i have no
reason to believe this part is historical there's many reasons to say that it's not such as going
a day after you bury the body to uh one of you know the few of the gospels have the women bringing
herbs to come and you know put with the body for the smell and whatnot and uh to to click but then
on john the gospel john has them doing it prior to putting them in when um when uh joseph uh
our aramathia you know helps them go and the women prep the body prior to burial the other ones
it's they're coming after he's already been buried and there's problems with that so you
can find those reasons but even if they didn't have that many problems how do you know what's
historical and what's not you know it's literary right right exactly well you know as we mentioned a
few minutes ago they um those two greek novels of um kina font and parts on uh feature the same
motif of you know the empty tomb that was the work of tomb robbers coming and literally stealing the
body out of the tomb and the protagonist you know comes to give libations for their departed
after they're buried and they find the stone all the way and is like oh what is this you know
they must have listened to heaven um and we know fact that bar urban uses those novels in his
teachings and um because he has said as much that was actually a point of disagreement between him
and dr price uh several years back now i think they were both on the same podcast like a few weeks
apart from each other and the hosts had played back some clips of what dr price had said and got
dr um's commentary on it and there was one place where price invoked the novels i just mentioned
and um he said you know we have instances of you know protagonist who survived the crucifixion
and and find an empty tomb and so forth and uh barterman goes well i don't know what the world
he's talking about i think he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about and yet i've seen
recorded lectures of barterman's classes are you familiar with the great courses yes by the tea
company yeah um there's several of those that permanent steven and he uses those novels and he
makes reference to them um so we know he's familiar with the material maybe just to like you said maybe
just took so many times of him arguing christians first that they get to have the butterfly effect
of like oh wait i have heard this story before and so these are the great novels that i use my
teaching yeah dude he just did a recent podcast um my good friend steven nelson sent me the link
it's on his youtube channel bart airman's youtube channel uh where's a catholic in it in about 25
minutes into the video you can go and check it out but they're arguing over judas the book of judas
and this is about his eternal conscious torment or annihilationism and he says jesus taught
annihilationism he didn't teach eternal conscious torment and of course the catholics like that's
foundational to you know much of what the church is teaching uh but he mentions judas and and he
i think uh goes to try and make the point that early church fathers uh reference it as if it's
holy writ or at least sacred scripture in some sense um and they start to get into a heated
like discussion and then the catholic literally invoked the name dr price this is well i just
want to let you know that we had dr roberton price on the show a couple months back he agrees with us
that judas was part of the holy script uh the holy writ of the uh church fathers even going back
to possibly pre nice scene uh and apostolic and that hope that judas might might have played a role
and uh and he just started laughing oh oh i'm sure you guys do have a lot in common like
why why do you have to you know but anyway i just thought that's funny because dr price and
me have talked about it we go well if he's already let go of that i don't think he'll ever be a
mythicist ever uh i do however think he's gonna uncover more issues and go you know i once thought
but now i think what do you think right right yeah exactly especially since he's already had an
entire book published on the matter of blood defending and his historical jeez i think he's
kind of maybe perhaps he has too much of the sunken cost fallacy in in a historicist view so
uh yeah i don't think maybe for the sake of his career and his i don't know pride i suppose
maybe that's a little sharp for me to say but maybe for the sake of those things i'll never
come around to publicly uh admitting to mythicism but yeah i agree with what you're saying think
as the years go on he'll he'll open the door to it a lot more unless he becomes a christian again
which might be more likely you never know that's so weird but i i don't know he'd have to be a
liberal for sure there's no way he can know about the text him but uh oh yeah but yeah
yeah that's i need to go watch the video i have seen it um suggested in the in the when
watching your channel i've seen that suggested in the sidebar you see the four guys and it's a
dude has a black mustache he's a catholic with a big crucifix on the door looks like he's about to go
in like well we were about to go gang bang like he looks like he's a gangster but he's such a nice
soft-spoken guy but he knows what he's talking about and he's so polite to airman but airman of course
when you press him or you think you have something and he oh no no you know it's like oh god so uh he
is sharp don't get me wrong i'm not trying to take that away from him at all but i don't think he
sees these things that we're talking about today as something significant he hasn't even read Dennis
mcdonald's work or if he has he hasn't commented on it dr mcdonald um the mythologizing jesus the
Homeric epics and their memetic criticism there suggesting that they they knew these narratives
at the very least they probably knew them in learning the greek that they're writing in as
they grew up what should make the Homeric epics very naturally something that they learn how to
write greek by using uh yeah and marks the most primitive use or the the lower class greek being
used but yeah and you know a good counterpart to that to really drive that point home for people who
may not be quite grasping the point that you're making we find that in our own modern culture
with the works of Shakespeare how that has really set the tone for how great fictional works have
been written in their narrative style in his ways interesting yeah i never really thought about that
but i think yeah all of us in the english-speaking world when we're in high school we're we're
obligated to learn the words of Shakespeare and then you can see when you read you know the great
books of the western world that were written thereafter they follow a very similar you know
narrative structure as the words of of Shakespeare because that you know like you said that was
required learning so those who learn our language ultimately kind of adapt part of that writing style
interesting that makes sense but yeah um what else did did you want to touch on um
what do you think i want to ask you this adam and eve what in that story do you think is going on
with everything that you've studied and do you see any weird stuff going on that's not just the
typical this is just a man woman being created like do you see celestial stuff in the narrative
i am not aware of a celestial allegory in the adam and eve story myself though it may exist
is just something i've never happened to have come across yet i have heard some pretty compelling
arguments at the um uh what are they called the genealogies of genesis and even some exodus
are a um Hebrew retelling so to speak perhaps not deliberate retelling but it's some kind of cultural
memory in the Hebrew culture of the king's list from Egypt from back when they were still you know
Egyptian citizens and then when they had a you know not necessarily an exodus that it didn't happen in
you know the biblical sense the way the biblical narrative tells it but when they migrated out of
Egypt and you know integrated into Canaan they kind of carried in this cultural memory of the
king's list um and that that there's a way you can again it goes back to numerology but when it
talks about like how many years did these patriarchs live like adam lived to be 900 and whatever years
old and right and then Noah lived to be this many and not this many that uh there's like a
numerological pattern there that when you take the number of days that these ancient kings reigned
in the ancient Egyptian kings list um that you can like multiply it a certain number of times and
you get the same number of years that are used for these patriarchs and the genealogies of genesis
and exodus and some of the and i've heard that some of the etymology kind of correlates to like when
you down the meaning of the name of this Hebrew patriarch it fits the meaning of the name of this
Egyptian king um so that that may be what's going on there um i think i don't need to tell you in
your audience that also by and large that obviously that Adam and Eve myth has its roots in like Sumerian
mythology about you know inky and and in lil creating the humans out of the earth as like this
agricultural workforce to tend their crops or their gardens so to speak so that the gods may have
rest and i believe that the story that this told in your tablets that's written like seven
stone tablets and it talks about how there were seven generations of gods before finally the gods
decided to create humans just like how in genesis you have the seven days before godfathers says
screw this let me create an animal to do this work for me i do know the Sumerian kings list
correlating to the biblical one makes a lot of sense and what you said about the Babylonian
not a hundred percent sure about it yet but i read it and was really fascinated by the works
of wrestlek american that i mentioned uh on the last podcast he's writing a book currently right
now on plateaus to mass and correlating that to genesis and showing why this is actually
a platonic narrative now you can find extremely old stuff in there but is that due to the fact that
the author of genesis is reading borosus from the alexandrian library uh this is just like
makes you kind of wonder like hey i wonder what's going on here i can't wait to read that book too
um i i have a buddy of mine that thinks that adam is a sun god as well um that there's some type of
pretty much he said you could practically you know how people have called the bible the b i b le and
they go the basic instructions before leaving earth and they have like funny titles for the whole
book he says you might as well call this the sun book uh it's pretty much about the sun and the
story of the sun and its life through through the universe through the world and and then obviously
how that correlates to man and so i thought that was interesting yeah i could see that because
there is um again there's another um uh i guess cosmology or or the theogony in
egypt in particular i think it's the tradition with um um from from heliopolis because as as a
different man has mentioned on your show before there wasn't a homogeny within ancient egyptian
beliefs either you know they had some variants and they're different you know we go to a different
territory or different city sometimes they'll vary on some of the details of their their theology
and their myth narratives um from heliopolis in their tale of the creation and um the birth of
the first gods it's a tale that sounds very similar to the birth of adam in fact the protagonist in
this particular story his name was hatun instead of adam but he was the first god the first male
creature of any kind in existence and the story they tell is that in the beginning there was just
water which we also find in the biblical genesis and that out of water arose the first massive land
which was the pyramid shaped structure called the um the benven stone and that out of then that earth
out of the out of the benven stone was born in full form as a man hatun and that he was the first
incarnation of the sun god and um and then uh you know is that that version is later incorporated
into other other versions of egyptian sun god lore hatun was kind of fused with some of the
other major sun gods such as ray such as capri and then they're kind of worked into this trinity
in later versions of um egyptian solar myth where capri as the beetle that you know is born out of
the dung ball capri represents um the sun when it's born in the eastern horizon every morning
and then as it reaches its zenith in the afternoon that's when he changes his form into ray the falcon
and then as he descends into old age in the evening and it's when he returns to his form as
hatun and that's when he you know sets below the horizon and dies of old age only to be reborn
again in the underworld but the point here being is that some of those elements of hatun's birth
kind of kind of overlap with like adam being born from out of the earth the earth which itself
could kind of be born out of this watery like primordial chaos you know that's interesting it
makes me wonder uh buddy of mine uh the co-host that that's helped me along the way dr lucer g
williams he says in the beginning uh right there where it says in the beginning in heber practically
saying when in heads when in heads and uh when you break it down i guess he was saying it's like
fire in the middle is what it seems like it's there's fire in the middle and it's pretty much he's
saying a pyramid is kind of what you're getting in the genesis one uh the very beginning there's
something to do with the pyramid now i don't know how strong he feels about that and how how much he
stands on that theory but um it just makes me kind of wonder you know what you just said how
much correlates and comes over into the hebrou side of things if they're not uh could they be could
they possibly be the uh the hit or not the hit type but the hexos egyptians you know and like
joes uh jocephus i think says that of his own people you know yeah absolutely i think there is
some some correlation i know that that that theory the hexos theory um has a lot of resistance in
mainstream scholarship yeah but in what i've read about it i find it very compelling um even if it's
not an accurate representation they're connecting themselves regardless okay i agree with that i do
think yeah that when the hebrus before the israelites i guess as we should call them and they were
formulating their own myth structure of their history which has come down to us as the old testament
i do think they perhaps incorporated legends of the hexos because the hexos were also canaanites
who had immigrated from egypt oh dude you should oh man you got me sparked up now i got to get
rossel gamirkin and and show you some of the stuff he says but solemn okay dude there's no
evidence right that there was a there was a kingdom ruling the way that it claims solemn ruled
and i can't remember who he says solemn actually is but just like you talked about the his
hexos the the the hebrus had a wonderful way of seeing wonderful like great kingdoms and great
kings and things and incorporate them and create their own personified version if you will a part
of the narrative and i can't remember who it was but uh dr price actually the other day was like really
he didn't even know this and i said dude you got to hear rossel gamirkin's explanation of who
solemn actually represents in history because the way he found this while he was reading source
material going back and i can't even remember the name so like sorry for anybody watching
i'm not going to be able to answer who this is but i'm just telling you what he did
is he found the furniture the furniture that's described in the the biblical narrative of how
many chariots solemn had and the gold and all these like things right that you're going that's a
hell of a kingdom like that's a that's a dynasty for real well there's no archaeological or any way
of proving anything like that ever was true in that sense um you know dr price said the best
they could do is they'll find a pama granite a wooden pama granite door knob and go oh this means
king david had a you know ruled and solemn ruled the temple you have a pama granite a wooded door
knob pama granite and you think there's a whole temple what he says all the time what do you think
you think angels came down with vacuum cleaners and uh let's clean this up so nobody finds out the
truth um he's this rustic american shows there's furniture listed in another ancient writing of
another culture and in that culture archaeologically we can tell they had massive kingdom structures
that could possibly make sense of that many chariots that much gold and it doesn't just say that like oh
well they had a lot of chariots no in the literature and i don't know where this literature is i don't
know the sources i'm just telling you what rustic american has mentioned in that literature if it's
said 400 chariots of gold uh in the bible that solemn had that's how many it had in the other
source for the other king so it's like there's like a one-to-one correlation almost makes you think
almost identical where you go dude i know where they picked this up and so that another thing
might be adding to his theory there's a lot of little things maybe adding to his theory of the
alexandrian origins in which the heber bible was constituted yeah i would love to yeah see that that
literature and the other correlates and yeah i've never heard that one that's a new one on me
i didn't know till about a month ago uh yeah and and there's definitely something going on in that
story too with solemn because it's almost like the story kind of gives you wings and nods because
it makes a point to to emphasize that one of solemn's wives was the princess of egypt and thus
you kind of have solemn tying his own bloodlines into the royalty of egypt as it's like saying that
like he was kind of like um a tetrarch or you know a tributary his king was more of an extension of
egypt itself which archaeologically speaking we know was actually the case at the time this
often was allegedly raining that palestine was still a colony of the egyptian empire
and that's that is another fascinating thing so you it's not uh false if you go if you're
reading these histories let's just say uh from big kingdoms that did a better job of keeping track
of things somewhat then yeah you can you can find a way where it makes sense and it doesn't sound
completely out of the blue because if you were trying to make all this up they wouldn't have
accurately portrayed some of this stuff here they wouldn't have done a good job unless they had
sources they're working from and i think that would be what i would do uh if if i were to write
something and i wanted to last forever i would i would make my story that much better and we're
not trying to crap on these stories we're not to me this might this might be sacred material that
people don't want uh spoken of in the way that we're talking about it trying to like find the human
aspect to it trying to really discover what really might be going on even though they'll
say that's sacred don't talk about it or they don't like that it's not my goal to try and like
dookie on the text no i but i am a fascinated person in the research because this book as a whole
i know that half of it more than half of it is sacred to an entirely different religious group
the jews uh but this whole book has fascinated me and it had me clawed in a fundamental aspect
so now i want to uncover and figure out what's going on and i i interview even the jews orthodox
jews on my channel to hear their their perspective and there are things i learn all the time from
them that i would not learn so i keep an open mind and research but i am a skeptic and uh i do think
that uh there's a lot of myth here i don't buy that snakes talk i don't donkeys you know red sea
now that might be a natural phenomena uh the flood could be a natural phenomenon just like
an ancient uh egypt the nile flooded the earth and then life came uh because it would water the
land for crops to grow you know what do you do right and yeah we we've sort of hit on this point
before but i think this is where we don't get a fair shake from our christian antagonism that
we don't hate the bible we don't hate christian culture and we aren't trying to debunk your
religion it's just that in our research of these things we've come to formulate a different
perspective on it and it has actually kind of reinvigorated our passion for the christian
culture and its history and its origins we find it fascinating it's no end and it's sort of like
what you mentioned earlier with your wife and in the working end of like archetypal themes in
in in the heavens and in um our literature um it still maintains a sense of sacredness about it
when you take on this more secular historical perspective on these these types of literature
and culture in that um what is communicated what it preserves through its popularity is the perennial
like messages that are included in its symbolism yeah yeah at least because of the success of the
bible um on uh human literature it's pretty much i mean for the foreseeable future it's going to be
around and it's still going to be a significant one it's going to be taught and reprinted and
carried on into the next generation and because of that the yes the star charts that it preserves the
the archetypes of the the monomyth of the heroes that it preserves will also carry on with it and
influence future cultures and that i think is a beautiful form i'm with you man i'm 100 percent
i think it's kind of to me i was when i was a kid i'd listen to the stories of jona getting swallowed
by a big fish a well you know whatever people love to argue over what the heck that it wasn't a well
it was a fish don't say that i mean i'm like let's not argue about that okay let's just point out
that it was something swallowed and went down into the sea okay uh but i'd listen to these stories
and i fell in love with them as a child they really are great stories as a kid i'm like oh wow this
is cool uh then you grow up right and then you go i'm having a hard time how do i explain this and
not seem retarded you know like i don't want to seem like i'm a dummy so you get an apologetics you
start to research more on uh how to explain a universal flood or or no it's local uh let's
keep this thing rational it's a local flood uh and it was a regional local flood and uh it was only
not not it was only the animals local to the the region in which this flood took place and
so you start to rationalize you start to make sense of your story to protect it originally
because when i was raised um my mom and dad uh i had a natural defense as i grew up to protect
them and they protected me so it's sacred what they what they say is is their word is bond you
know what i'm saying like take it to the bank that's mom and daddy you know and the same goes for
these sacred stories as you're raised up to believe in them i guess what happened to me is i was at
the magic show one day and just oh my gosh he levitated wow chris uh what's his name the angel
chris angel man holy crap how did he do that he's floating 50 feet in the air and then uh i said you
know um i'll just use my uh my relapse back on the drugs and struggling in life as a a bathroom break
from the magic show i went to go take a bathroom break took a wrong turn and uh when i did i saw
behind the curtain and realized oh my god could i be wrong is this magic real or is it a great show
and now i can have more appreciation for the show than i ever had before realizing the artist behind
the magician show and how they articulated to create this illusion in front of you and if you
can decode what they're doing you know what they just did and win during the magic trick and so
everyone in the world is being oh the fish the giant well the talking snake the and i'm standing
here going you don't see that constellation in the sky you don't recognize the celestial
agricultural aspect and that's pretty much what it is i think we saw behind the curtain
and the woo and the aw has stopped becoming the fundamentalist layer that layer we recognize
is actually harmful now that we we see what it is what it does we now are going behind the scenes
and we're still in the show but in a totally different respect but we aren't just looking
at one magic show called the bible we're saying hey you guys in the audience did you know there's
an entirely different magic show by the greeks and there's another one over here by the samarians
and there's another one with the egyptians and by the way they all used to have similar magic shows
and sometimes they'd have these people from the egyptians come over here and and they'd have
you know cross-cultural diffusion and here we go trying to explain and understand as adults you
know so when i was a child i thought as a child and here i am today right yeah absolutely like
like learning i think that's a very great analogy is is using stage magic and illusionist because
yeah you're mesmerized as it you're mesmerized by it as a kid but once as a teenager you learn
that it is all illusion and that there's no supernatural element to it that never makes
it any less entertaining like when i found out of the way david copperfield did a lot of his tricks
back in the day um when he still had his annual tv specials in the early 90s i still found it
just as entertaining as when i believe what he was doing was actual magic um learning like he said
it's peering behind the curtain and learning how the tricks are done doesn't make it any less
appealing in my opinion no because now instead of our fascination being on we're believing in
something fake or something that's not the real it's not what it really is we now want to probe
deeper uh into why we even want to go deeper to go who came up with magic to begin with and why
what was the psychology behind illusions for humanity and what was you know like we want to
get deep into it right like we want to find out what's really going on uh it reminds me the amazing
randy i love uh love the amazing randy he dealt with what i like to call fundamentalist magicians
all throughout his life they stood on they still his till today the million dollar challenge you
have fundamentalist magicians who i i'm gonna go so far as to say this this is the same thing i
tell atheists all the time they these tv preachers are full of it they're all fake they don't believe
what they're teaching uh i wouldn't say that bro i'm gonna tell you something some may and it's
probably far less than you think that actually don't believe what they're saying most of these guys
drink the kool-aid so much they believe what they're actually doing and saying that they've tricked
themselves there's no way for them to see the truth it's just the way it is and then some of them are
con artists but he dealt with some guys that were bending spoons and somehow are able to
do these tricks on tv i loved watching that show he had a show on netflix recently and it makes you
really think even outside of religion it's a human problem it's a human problem of being truly
honest on what's going on and uh some people really do believe these snake a snake i actually
talked because the bible said it or a donkey actually talked or or you know you name it whatever
the impossible appears to be the supernatural they believe it regardless because the book says it
the amazing randy goes to dispel these magicians and show by the way i'm still a magician doing
magic but this is an illusion i'm not going to lie to you and pretend that this is not an illusion
i'm just that good that you might think i really did something and uh you know i i appreciate that
i do appreciate that honesty yeah absolutely um chris angela even did that at a point i don't
think he does it as often as randy does because obviously randy has made a career out of debunking
but i remember like when he was hosting that show that was like it was like um an american idol for
illusionists do you remember that i i don't think i remember that one no i think it was called
phenomenon or something to that effect which he incidentally actually co-hosted with um
erie galler which was the most famous uh psychic that james randy bumped um so that's kind of like
a help really catapult james randy into another level of fame but um they were kind of serving as
each other's foil on this show but i remember yeah that was one of the things that chris would often
do is that he would point out when whenever um contestant came on stage and they were trying
to promote what they were doing as real especially where it involved like invoking spirits or calling
forth the dead or or goes to whatever uh chris chris angela was very quick to shut that down
and be like no i don't believe that you can replicate everything you've done there with
sage magic i love that stuff i do man and that goes that goes for this uh research that we're
doing here we're not uh yeah we might be stealing your your thunder when it comes to your tithes
that come in on sunday because your story has to be literally true but to me it creates a division
in reality that doesn't need to be there that my book my belief is the true one and everyone
else's is wrong uh that's a psychological issue to me that i don't want because i'm a humanist
a secular humanist i do believe in uh trying to unify humanity and i think as long as we
have these world views that are exclusive in the manner in which they are if they evolve
great i hope they do uh but i think the fundamentalist one is not only wrong right because i came
from it but i think it can be harmful yes you know it can be yeah luckily i yeah i think
from what i've seen in research the trajectory of religions is generally that they don't ever like
regress into previous states of more extreme fundamentalism they always seem to tend to
either uh spin off into a new religion or they evolve and incorporate uh more progressive
culture and and kind of flow with the times um so yeah i don't i don't think we're in any
danger of christianity ever going back to what it was during the medieval days but perhaps some
new religion that arises in the future will repeat those same mistakes unfortunately um but
yeah yeah i think um i think definitely we'll see it can continue to evolve in a more positive
direction absolutely with you bro and we got to do more of these um i definitely need to
do some surfing through the old astro theology stuff that i once used to uh listen to often
and go into the narratives but um i was going to ask you prior to us closing out here the 12
zodiac signs the 12 disciples the 12 tribes did you see correlation with the 12 zodiac signs and
in genesis i believe 49 it is or 48 or something where i didn't absolutely i'm glad you mentioned
that because yeah that was kind of sticking in my mind when you mentioned it early in the show
yeah where it i think goes through each of the 12 patriarchs in the list like an animal or some kind
of symbol with them a cornucopia or something like that and like wow you find a lot of this in the uh
in the wreck of roman zodiac so that and it makes me think of like uh oh wow it's raining outside
pretty hard right now um it makes me think of the uh native americans you know they everything was
animal now that i don't know i don't have any evidence of this but i would suspect that there's
same stuff going on there they just probably use different types of animals that were culturally
located near them um and then of course the new testament on disciples you see that as well right
oh yeah absolutely um you mentioned before they wear a jeez this talks about how you know are
they're not 12 hours in a day you know i'm the one in the world and follow me and all this stuff
where he kind of gives little winks and nods to what himself and his apostles are supposed to
sort of represent right um yeah absolutely you you can find that uh affirmed in our earliest
there's a question artwork as well where you know typically jesus is portrayed being in the center
with a solar halo around his head often um very parallel to images of solemn victims or helios
and around him are the 12 apostles whereas in the counterpart in uh greek artwork you might find um
sol being surrounded by the 12 signs of the zodiac so clearly they're trying to tell you
they're trying to point to you like what they're symbolized what the the apostles
correlate to i love that dude i love that stuff because it frees you up a little on that approach
we once had uh and it doesn't make everything so so literal um you know if anything it protects the
book more uh from uh from it looking worse than it could be in my opinion because if a literalist
approach is what is intended throughout you know like the new testament narrative let's just say in
the gospels we there's gonna be a problem a lot of stuff just doesn't work out unless you believe
this is the only supernatural you know everything literally happened the way it's described you've
got a lot of problems and then you have conflicts between synoptics and how far are you willing to
go to try and die on the hill of this is literal historical and it's just a scary place to go
my opinion but yeah and yet even jesus himself made big use of parable and and trying to
allegorize things like hey there's a deeper point here try to decode this
dude thank you for joining me i really do appreciate that next show we do we'll uh we'll
have a more material prepped and ready and maybe we'll get derrick's uh derrick's butt on here man
and i would love that yeah because derrick's getting into he's been reading the scholars
specifically that he's dealing with right now that are they're with us and they're not you know
in terms of like seeing this stuff and i'm not educated enough to know with certainty but we'll
get there together man and i really do appreciate it uh neil everything's down in the description
ladies and gentlemen check out his website go check it out he's got a lot of blogs down there
and uh is there anything else that i'm putting down in the in the description for you um
mythodoxy.wordcrest.com or alternatively mythicism.net um is where you can find my uh my thoughts on
the matter. nice well thank you and ladies and gentlemen don't forget we are myth vision
