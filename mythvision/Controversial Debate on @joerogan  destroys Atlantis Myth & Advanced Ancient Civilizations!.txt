Welcome back to MythVision podcast. I'm your host Derek Lambert recently on Joe Rogan's podcast
There was a discussion slash debate the tension was in the air between our guest today Dr. Flint Dibble and
Graham Hancock welcome to MythVision Flint
Hi, it's great to be here Derek. Thanks. Would you do you mind if I call you Flint or dr. Dibble or what's the best?
Flint's fine. It's all good
for those who aren't acquainted with you or
Haven't seen the debate. Can you tell us a little bit about your expertise who you are and what you were doing on Joe Rogan's podcast?
That's that's a long story. That's like my life story
um, so I'm an archaeologist and I
Mostly work in the ancient Greek world though. I've also worked in the Anatole Caves, Egyptian tombs a
wide variety of places throughout the Mediterranean world and so my expertise is environmental archaeology and
I have a YouTube and I'm on X Twitter and I often times try to share archaeology with the public
It's something I'm passionate about and at the same time a lot of the public always comes and asks questions
about things like Graham Hancock's ideas and so in a sense when his Netflix show came out
I wrote a viral Twitter thread and
Things escalated and it ended up being that I ended up on Joe Rogan to talk with Graham
about his ideas and to try to
Represent an archaeological sort of point of view about those kind of ideas that he has about a lost I say civilization and so yeah
Thank you for joining us and explaining that for those who may not know
It might pique your curiosity to go watch the debate yourself. It was like four hours long
It was worth it in my opinion. This was the first time I think publicly someone representing mainstream
academia in respect to archaeology
combated
Graham head-on well, you know, that's actually something that look when I was on there
I didn't want to address every minor point, but he actually was completely wrong. He said this was the first time
That's not true. He's had three showdowns with Zahi El Was
One of the famous ones is when Zahi El Was storms off at the start of one
However, he also had earlier ones in the 1990s with Zahi El Was one on a cruise ship off the coast of Alaska
Which was which was broadcast on the radio and so he doesn't like to bring these up
He also was invited I think to Penn State to to have a conversation with the late professor
I think it was Garrett Fagan or Brian Fagan and
When it was when he was billed as a pseudo scientist
He refused to go and so he has had other sort of circumstances like this
I don't know why he tries to cover them up there from about 20 years ago or so 25 years ago
Yeah, I have to introduce this in a way that people can empathize with with what's going on
Joe Rogan, you know, I have this kind of a tug-of-war inside when I listen to him, especially during this debate
I'm like good job, Joe. Oh what Joe come on Joe and like, you know, it's this weird thing that makes me internally struggle because
Little fun fact about me is I was a die-hard Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock fan
four to seven years ago when I started this channel and in fact one of the things that inspired me to
Even start this channel was alternative hypotheses alternative rabbit holes and things like that and
Mythicians started off as kind of a fringe scholar
Like let me find these fringe theories fringe hypotheses to explain origins of Christianity
the Roman emperors created it and it's all a conspiracy and like I did all of these things and
I started to mature throughout the years as I learned more about what actual academia said now
You could see me with people from Cambridge
Cambridge Princeton yell Harvard like all over the world kind of breathe the edge
Yeah, exactly. And so I want to start by saying I understand
Why they're their their ideas are appealing and attractive and I want analogy
I'll give and then love to have your comments here on what is the psychology behind why so many people are mesmerized by these things
The aliens and stuff and I was at a restaurant
Working as a construction worker as a supervisor at this company and my wife was eating with me and I said honey
Because she's not familiar with history that well and I said you ever heard of a place called Atlantis and she's like
No, and I'm like it was this massive civilization
They had rules and very very noble nation that tried to take care of itself and help others
I started to like describe Atlantis and moral senses and how they were every day every day people mom pop sisters brothers
Families and all this but something went wrong and a deluge a flood took place that completely wiped them out
Notice how you don't even know about that well
Imagine hypothetically in 30 40,000 years from now
we have another restart because of a worldwide catastrophe and someone goes have you ever heard the story of America and
She goes whoa and I said now imagine we've been completely forgotten all we have are these
Faces on this rock mountain of these people who supposedly ruled this place
We call America and I started to paint it in almost like a fictional way
It was so appealing that me and her were kind of like even I'm telling this doctor
You know, I think you've convinced me
Right so there's something about that in our minds we like stories
Yeah, and the question is is the story of Atlantis is there any historical basis?
Is it true? What are your thoughts as an expert in the ancient Greek world?
Yeah, it is
Decisively not true
It's actually really clear when you start looking at all the evidence that we have for things like mythology and for the context
Where it's written down Plato itself, you know
you look at the way Plato introduces the story and
It's introduced as a conversation that takes place the day after the Republic where Socrates and
Colleagues in the sense come up with this ideal city state
They devise the Constitution and how the morals for the city and so the next day
what they want to do is they want to see this ideal city and discuss how it will perform in a war and
It sort of becomes like from Sim City building the city to a game of civilization
They want to see how what will happen with their ideal city state when it has an opponent
And so what they do is they say let's let's create this thought experiment
Let's make the ideal city state Athens and let's come up with Atlantis as the opponent
And so that's the entire setting for the conversation where they were Plato comes up and tells the story of Atlantis through the words of
Critias
Who is one of the tyrants of Athens after the Spartans defeated Athens in the Peloponnesian War?
And so you know the whole setup makes it really clear that it's just a
Philosophical thought experiment and so you know you can kind of even ground truth it so you can fact-check it if you want
you know people like to see what you can see in real space if you see what I mean and so
What everybody ignores is so people looking for Atlantis
they go to the descriptions of Atlantis in the Timmy s in the
Critias the two dialogues and they sort of have like you know circular islands and this kind of stuff the
The descriptions of the temples and and whatever right and they try to find it on the planet somewhere
You know some circular monument or island or something
And so what they forget to do is we can fact-check the description of Athens because half of this actually describes Athens
You know the early Athens that's supposed to fight Atlantis and guess what?
We know the archaeology of Athens and we can see and we know the geology of Athens and for example in this
to me know Critias describes
The Acropolis and another bedrock outcrop the capitals is connected and we know that just geologically could not be true
And so in that sense we can fact-check that if we can't trust the details about Athens itself Plato's
From Athens he taught in Athens he died in Athens right if we can't trust the details about Athens
How can we trust any of these details about Atlantis if you see what I mean?
And so the third thing which people don't seem to I guess realize is
We also have a whole lot of evidence for the way that oral myth and stories and legends in the Greek world are kind of
Transmitting right and so we have this sort of evidence that we can fact-check against archaeology again
So for example in the Iliad, you know the Trojan war cycle
We have these descriptions of sort of shields and spears and helmets
And we can compare that to our own archaeology and art history of shields and spears and helmets and swords at the times
When these oral poetry was happening right and so we can actually find these correlates
Directly in the Iliad in the Odyssey and we can actually find them from different periods in Greek prehistory
So sometimes the poet is describing a Bronze Age style spear
Sometimes the poet is describing an Iron Age style spear
And so it's this kind of mishmash of Bronze Age and Iron Age culture because it's oral poetry
That's passed on over hundreds and hundreds of years
And so we can we can we can fact-check that and see that and it lines up just perfectly
We can see the artistic representations of these oral legends
In fact, we have art of scenes or examples of myths that we don't even have texts for
Right, so we have like, you know Achilles and Ajax
Dicene right by the sea outside of Troy, you know this sort of snapshot of some legend that's lost of this kind of game
They were playing we even know that Achilles is winning because every single time he's thrown showing the dice
He has the higher role because they speak on the vase. It's oftentimes carved out the words
You know, he has a three and Ajax has two and so, you know, we have this rich
Artistic record, but nothing for Atlantis. It's just literally nothing. It's just a philosophical allegory
So there's so much you said here. That's amazing. I just discovered on a vase
There is a an image of a giant sea serpent spewing up Jason the Argonaut
Yeah, you know, but we don't have any written. We don't have any written myth about it anymore
We lost exactly and so I actually am looking for antecedents to the Jonah myth in the Bible
And this is one of this this image comes to mind on top of Heracles
with
Heracles and Perseus and these various myths of these seabees that they're fighting and I'm like, huh
There's some seems to be some possible correlation between Jonah and and what we're finding in the Greek myths over here
But we've lost it like you said the other thing is is people looking for Atlantis are over here and like
Florida keys and stuff. I mean like like is there any reason to go that far anyway?
No, definitely not. I mean, you know the way Plato describes it
It's like another city-state is how it's described like another Greek style city-state
In fact in many ways what people think is actually
It's the roles are switched
Athens the way that Athens is described
It seems to be like a political allegory for the Spartans, right?
Because they have this very communal lifestyle where they're living on the Acropolis in these barracks and you know
It's exactly how the Spartans live and so on the other hand Atlantis seems to be the lavish
Over extravagant as an allegory for either sometimes some people argue it's for the Persians other people argue it's for the Athenians themselves as a
Warning, but it's just kind of silly like you said coming over to America and things like that this idea that like there were any survivors
For example of the flood that destroyed Atlantis, right? The book ends. It actually is cut off. It's not finished
We don't know if Plato ever finished it or if it we just have that much preserved. It's not clear
But the the book ends with the destruction of Atlantis
There are no survivors and so you know this idea of survivors teaching a lost, you know
Hunter-gatherers the secrets of advanced technology
Right that's a complete modern invention. And do you know where it comes from? It comes from a book of fiction written by
Francis Bacon in the early 17th century called the New Atlantis and and what's really interesting is that book
Also was never finished, which is kind of weird
But if that book of fiction set up this idea of sort of Atlantis having survivors that had lost in advanced tech
Technology and then slowly from the 17th all the way down to the 19th century
It was converted into this myth of some sort of lost
Ice age civilization with advanced tech that like somehow has evidence though
It doesn't have any evidence that everybody's familiar with through Graham Hancock and others. Yeah
This is an amazing observation
So it's it's safe to say without necessarily direct influence
It could be independent due to the fact that the snowball effect of this continuing in the in the imagination of people who are trying to come up with
Explanations, maybe they're scientific and they're trying to like hypothesize on what they think
But most of this sounds a little bit more fictive in the imagination like I showed earlier explaining that honey
You ever heard of the story of America and there's a sense in which we all kind of like a myth
We like, you know Marvel and Capcom and the video like these serious
Interesting fictional worlds that we enter Lord of the Rings the list goes on and on
And you know, it's interesting you can even see this with JRR Tolkien
So right JRR Tolkien is a scholar who studies myth
But what's interesting is when he adapts the Atlantis story and creates new Menor he doesn't adapt Plato's
Atlantis he adapts this 19th century
Ignatius Donnelly's version where Numenor is destroyed in a flood
but the survivors make it to the mainland and
Set up Gondor and Arnor and teach the other men this kind of technology of this high
civilization of Numenor and so he's even adapting that kind of
More entertaining story if you see what I mean
Yeah, his fiction and knowingly so because he was surely familiar. He read ancient Greek
He was a scholar of myth and ancient Greek and Latin at Oxford
And so yeah, so he knew what he was doing and it's kind of interesting because he mentions in his letters that he's purposefully
he has these dreams of a flood and that's what causes him to write Numenor and
And into that and everything. Yeah, wow
I'll say one one of the big controversial moments on the Joe Rogan podcast that you had with Graham was
These accusations if it quickly became this oh
Flint you're you're doing this
What they would call woke?
Kind of stop trying to you know discredit Graham with saying what he's saying is racist and then
The other side which would be your side. I'd like to give a voice to today and that is I
Personally know as a content creator as a youtuber when I'm engaging with other ideas that I'm finding a pseudo
Alternative or whatever. They're always ends up this crowd of anti-Semites or you know
Like there are racist people literally that are not ashamed to be that way publicly who are using the work of certain individuals and they like
They practically have a safe haven in these people without those people themselves condemning
Those outright very outspoken saying no no no no no and even if you're borrowing from ideas from people who had
These racist or ugly ideas in the past, you know letting yourself know like this guy was off on this
I think he's right on this but this guy is just horrible in this area or whatever it is
You were trying to express that Graham is holding the ideas
that people are
Recognizing these sources that there are a lot of racist tendencies in these sources and
Can you explain what those are and what you're trying to get across before yeah?
You know when him ganged up on you and pretty much just want to pin you down
I mean yeah, and this all goes back again to the history of these ideas, right?
And so this idea we I mentioned sort of Francis Bacon around the same time
He's writing the new Atlantis the Spanish crown is using Greek stories both Atlantis and the myth of the Hesperides as
a reason for the Spanish crown to have a claim on the you know indigenous territories in the Americas and
So you know there's this entire wrap-up
From colonialism period, you know 16th century up through the 19th century
You could see for example the trail of tears Andrew Jackson
He specifically cites this idea that there's an earlier civilization that was responsible for the Native American mounds as
a reason to kick them off their land and to march them west and so you know this kind of fake history of this kind of
Atlantis advanced civilization that existed earlier has been used time and time again in the past to displace
indigenous peoples in the Americas and so there's this
History there that's very much wrapped up in these kind of ideas
Mormonism too by the way. Yes, you can definitely see that in
Several of the myths of Mormonism and you know you can see this of finds for example of people planting in the 19th century
sort of 19th century
forgeries of Judeo-Christian Near Eastern texts to try to make it look like the lost tribes of Israel were there or something like that
In the Americas and to sort of strip credit away from indigenous people for their heritage and and their rights to the land as well
You have to realize this is all wrapped up in taking land and so, you know, this is this is straight up
Colonization is what's going on and so there's this dark history to it and I mean this carries forward
You can see this carry forward even into sort of the Aryan supremacy myths of the Nazis, right?
So so Himmler, he sets up the Akhenerb Institute
Which actually goes out and does archaeological excavations around the world trying to demonstrate that the Aryans are the descendants of the Atlanteans and
Therefore are a more advanced race and so there's this whole subcurrent to this kind of idea
It doesn't mean that everybody that believes in a lost civilization is some sort of overt racist who mistreats people of color
I'm not trying to argue that in the least
But there is this undercurrent and as you said you can see it among some people more loud and overt online people that say
This is very clearly a white civilization that say the the ancestors of indigenous peoples were
Squatting in the ruins of some advanced civilization. I've seen that right put that way
And so it's just like there are these much more harmful actors
You know and people today that are that are really overtly twisting these kind of words
And so I think I even said at some point, you know, Graham
Do you want to denounce this kind of people and so it's just like yeah, I'm not trying to accuse it of you
But you should distance yourself from this kind of stuff
I mean we have to deal with this in archaeology all the time look earlier archaeologists are real archaeology also was part and parcel of
Colonialism, you know, this is certainly, you know, archaeologists in the 19th century
They looted and stole from conquered people
You know, and so we are trying to deal with the ramifications of that today
And so for I'm very strongly for repatriation or and giving ownership of material culture to you know, the the original
Countries where where they're from and I think that we should be working with people
I mean, I do this all the time when I go to Greece
I follow the Greek law that the Ministry of Culture sets up
I've had to go to Greece to collect material in March and it turns out something was signed wrong on one of my forms
So I couldn't go and so I need to go back again
Sorry, I couldn't bring the material back with me to Cardiff to sample it for isotope analysis
And so, you know, I have to go back again, you know, this kind of bureaucratic red tape is part and parcel
But the Greeks should control their heritage just like people in more impoverished areas should control their own heritage as well
And so, you know, archaeology, I'm not trying to excuse my, you know
My past colleagues and any current colleagues that act dismissively towards, you know, indigenous people or stakeholders
I think we need to be working with them
What is your walk-away based on that experience with Graham on this issue of distancing himself from those online?
It felt to me and then I'd like to get your thoughts is that Joe and
Him we're trying to really nail you for this as if you were wrong in making accusations and
In no way in that process all he said was well once you label someone that you've ruined their reputation
And you don't even have to defeat their arguments, which by the way, what arguments what evidence, right?
That was clearly brought up
Clearly clearly like, you know, he while he said this bad thing you call me racist
You call me this and that like he made it seem like that's what you called him and you were trying to say
I'm not calling you now. I'm saying you're you're creating an environment or
Like opening this environment where all these people who are using your work who are in the same avenue as you and you're not you look
Like the rest of the ducks that are lined up. You're not this different thing
Even if you yourself aren't
What is your takeaway on that? You've never heard Graham ever
Make the statement like outright that it sounds racist. I don't know. What are your thoughts? Have you?
He's used so he's made some statements in the 90s that are the sound kind of racist
I think some of that is older use of language like, you know, the language that today we wouldn't use
He's fairly careful. I mean as people point out
He's he's married to a person of color and so, you know, I think he does try to be careful not to be overtly offensive
I think
And so on that I commend him, but I wish you would you know denounce this kind of misuse of his material and
That worries me that he's well
He's not willing to go do that because he really should that's just kind of disgusting not to denounce this kind of people
That's called a white civilization and say these nasty things about indigenous people that are not capable of
Their own heritage and so, you know, I mean, you know, my takeaway on canceling is just ludicrous. I'm not trying to cancel Graham
He's uncancelable. He's too much of a celebrity. He has, you know, a major TV show
He's a best-seller on Amazon and Amazon's the one that lumps his book in the subcategory of archaeology
You know, and it's frequently rated in the top few books there and you know, Netflix rates it as a docu series
Saying I'm trying to cancel him. I'm like a fucking nobody
I don't know how else to put that like I'm a scholar what what I now have 35,000 Twitter followers and like now
I jumped from 4,000 YouTube subscribers to 12,000 come subscribe to me
I'm gonna do some more material on this
But you know, I want to do one a series on Atlantis is one that I've been working on a scripted series that has some
Animation and really explains why we should not be believing in these philosophical allegories is true and delves into that in depth
But you know, I yeah, but what I am is I'm a scholar and what we study is the history of these ideas and how they're deployed in today's world
That's what we do, you know, I study I study this kind of thing
And so for me not to bring that up is kind of silly you bring up the history of ideas when people talk about communism
They bring up Karl Marx, you know, this is just how things go when you talk about stuff you talk about the history of it
That's how scholarship works. So, you know, it's not trying to tar him as a racist
I give him every opportunity to distance himself from racism and I hope he does more strongly and other thing you mentioned Joe Rogan
Yes, one of the things that surprised me was about near the end of that
part of the conversation where I brought up the image of Ketzel koala
From pre-contact having darker skin not white skin as described in these kind of post colonial sources
And you know, even Joe then realized what the point I was trying to make he started telling Graham
He said, you know, of course colonialism and subjugation is gonna have an impact on these people in the story
They tell and you know and Graham's like, well, I'm just interested in these sort of points and Joe's like of course
This is gonna have an impact and and Graham just couldn't see that
I don't understand how he couldn't see that because you know legends and stories change over time
What's going on has an impact if you go watch 300 the movie from the 1960s
It's totally, you know
You can see how it's an allegory for the Cold War with one side being the you know
The the West and the other side being the the East the Communist East and then you look at 300 in the
2000s and it's very much a an allegory for you know
What's going on at that time the Iraq war and so you can see this very very clearly in the choices
You know the directors and casting decisions that they made for those two versions of that same story
If you see what I mean, right? And so it's just that this is just how stories go there
They're they're they're told in a contemporary environment
Mythmaking yeah, mythmaking is always trying to anchor itself into a subtle
Contemporary historical situation often and usually scholars can see between the lines that kind of thing
An interesting point that you brought about Joe was at first
I was a little bit like annoyed is that that was the tug of war that I have because I'm like man
we need more really good academics bringing the fire bringing the real good arguments and
Seeing Joe throughout that start to go to your side to be honest with you
I think he's light bulbs started going off for him as you were making your point and the big big killer was
What evidence do we have and based on what we have already discovered because he's acting like we haven't we haven't turned over
Every single pebble on planet earth to find the secret massive advanced technology
I'm just kidding because I don't want a strong man. I'm but he changed his view
It seems during this episode to making them shamanic. What's that mean?
Eating, you know, I mean, I think he argues that at times
You know, I really tried to I tried to go into this and do what's called steel manning him in a sense
Take the best version of his of his idea and show what the evidence actually is
And so, you know, and I didn't even want to bring up race to begin with because I thought I realized for the context
That's not the right venue to do that
And so, you know, that's not people don't in that context did not want to hear the history of the ideas
They wanted to hear what the actual archaeological evidence was and so, you know, that was what I went there with and yeah
And I was kind of surprised to hear him say there was nothing after what how many books and you know
TV shows and stuff like that to say oh, there's nothing everywhere
I've brought you actually is not evidence for my civilization and it's like whoa, you know
one of the things I realized a week later sort of thinking back on the conversation is he specifically avoided talking about any actual
Archaeological sites, you know, instead he wanted to do the victimization
I'm calling him names or something like that or he wanted to go to these kind of
geological natural features that
Look sort of human-made, but don't really look that human-made if you're an archaeologist and know what
Architecture actually looks like, you know, and so it's just sort of he wanted to avoid going to any archaeological sites
And that's that kind of made me feel good. It was like all right
He realized that came with evidence and he didn't he realized he didn't have the evidence to even argue those points
And when you guys did try to get him to talk about the one site, uh
Yeah, yeah way down there supposedly ground radar and Joe had some really good points Joe was like
Well, so this is less evidence than this road that you can at least see that you're claiming is underwater over here
Like below Florida. Um, I don't know the exact location. That's why I'm just saying I know it's somewhere
Yeah, and the Atlantic and I'm looking at it going dang
This is a good point because all you have is like bounce off radars. There's not really
Any like we're not looking at it and actually observing what is there
It's all based on bouncing off these, you know, the technology that's looking through the ground to try and discover what's down there and
When you all pin him there to try and really know we need to deal with this for a moment
He's like it's in the paper. He couldn't find it in the paper
He's like you just got to go read the paper by this guy over here who is on my website
Yeah, yeah, and you got you kept bringing evidence which leads me to my question was there any evidence you
You know, you mowed this over for a year. I imagine you had sleepless nights thinking about what's coming
You know what I mean, though, like you really thought I had a lot of shower conversations
This conversation is gonna happen. Let's gameplan it. Yeah
Was there any
Argument in your mind that you were like I'm coming this I need to really nail this one
And you never got to mention it
Was there any arguments that you thought about that you brought in your computer and said this needs to be shown to Joe
This needs to be explained. Yeah, there was one
So I just put out a video last week about kind of my reaction to the event and in there
I had the one so I sort of only came in with two sort of let's say gotcha points
One of them was was
His numerology stuff the sacred numbers that he uses with the procession and I got to get that in there
Where what he does is he talks about and what's well, sorry, let me backtrack a little to set this up
so we moved to Egypt and when because Joe wants to talk about Egypt and so right Graham thinks he wants to go to
Ed foo and and and and that's the one I didn't get to bring up and so I say it because he
Claims that he has those hieroglyphic texts from Ed foo the called the Ed foo texts that tell the story of
Atlantis in you know in Egypt
It's an Egyptian story, which is what's told in Plato's, you know
Critias that it came so long got it from Egypt and so he makes this big claim in magicians of the gods about this and
So he starts bringing this up. He says let's go to Ed foo and I my best gotcha was these Ed foo texts
I'll tell you what it is in a second or if you want to see it on written out. It's on my latest YouTube video, but
But so I say yes
Let's go to Ed foo and he must have recognized how confident I was because he backed off and never went to Ed foo
They actually even cut me out saying yeah, let's talk about that in the final release
Which which they did very minimal editing. I think it was probably because we were talking over each other
Yeah, they didn't do any editing that I saw to try to make me look bad or anything like that
It was professionally edited. I just think I we were talking at the same time
But in that talking at the same time
I said yes, let's go to Ed foo and he gave me this little look and then he didn't he didn't go to Ed foo at all instead
What he did is he went to his numerology spiel where he talks which was my second gotcha
So it worked out well for me and where he talks about the height of the great pyramid and you multiply it by forget
What it is 58,000 or something like that, which why because that's 72 times
14,000 or some some crap like that and that equals the polar radius of the earth
And so when I was sort of preparing for this I was recovering from surgery
And I was sitting there kind of like zonked out on painkillers and I saw him use this math
On a podcast and I was like oh he likes to talk about this
Let's figure out a response and so you know I came up with the response
I used where I showed how you could do this with pretty much any number and so I showed how to do it with the number of columns in
The Parthenon there's 69 columns magic number boom you do the right multiplication
You get the you know equatorial circumference of the earth or you could do it in reverse you do 420
So that every time you're smoking a joint you're connecting mathematically with the earth
You know and so I got that one in there and I was like you know
This is just what math is you can figure out how numbers relate if you do it backwards and Joe's like oh, yeah
That makes sense. You know it's like no Graham
This makes this is not an argument if you see what I mean
So sorry long story to get to what I left out the Ed foo texts in his book
The magicians of the gods he has these long quotes of these ed foo texts and they're so
Like terribly research is ridiculous a he's not quoting the actual ed foo texts
He's quoting some book on Egyptian religion that's discussing the ed foo text
Be the ed foo text date to after Plato so after Atlanta story see the quotes
He grabs are from like hundreds of pages away
He grabs one sentence from page 253 then puts it next to a sentence from page 100
Then next to a sentence from page 50 and says this is the coherent story of Atlantis being destroyed and it's like
What are you fucking talking about man? You can't do that
It's like taking a sentence
I don't know from the book of Job and then another sentence from the book of Genesis and
Making a new biblical story out of it. And so it's just like man. It's a real gotcha
I actually did it to his books where I found different sentences on different pages
And I told the story that I wanted to tell of Flint being an archaeologist that
Excavated some site and prove there was no Ice Age civilization because you can do that using his words
Right, you can say whatever you want
Just put some ellipses in there and some footnotes and you can say whatever you want
Just one comment about the mathematics stuff that a piece or appealed to me when I was first listening to Randall Carlson
He gets into geometric shapes and then procession of the equinoxes
For those who don't know the earth is on a tilt and so it goes through these almost so diet zodiac type
Ages right which are like
2240 years
Something like that for 24,000 year full rotation 24 to 26,000 year full rotation of the of the earth on its axis and
It goes through these ages and I thought I was decoding
Esoterically the Bible at this time in my life going oh my gosh
So you had the golden calf which by the way at that time
I didn't know to think of like bulls as ancient near Easter in like
Animal-symboling sex and fertility and the god
I'm thinking bull as in tourists the zodiac sign and I'm thinking completely esoteric and anachronistic and thinking
That's the sign of tourists and they're moving into the sign of Aries
Which is why you end up having the lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world the lamb
Then we're moving into the fish which Jesus represents the fish going into a Pisces and eventually getting into Aquarius
like I was thinking like that when I was listening to these guys and then
I'm listening to him going to the calculations in the perfect even Joe seems sold on this idea that like I've studied the pyramids
Thoroughly and I've listened to the different hypotheses on how they built it by the way. We aren't sure exactly how
The great pyramids of Giza were you know built exactly, but we know they were built the inscriptions talk about this
We have enough evidence. I just interviewed Karakuni who's in Egyptologist
She went over this she loves you by the way and she wanted me to give you a shout out on this episode great, but hi Cara
Right
But the idea that that it's just so almost impossible and we couldn't replicate them today
Well, I said to my brother-in-law. I don't think we would want to put that much money into stacking stones
Today because we don't do it if we try to this is the effort of you know
Tens of thousands of people to do that. You know, that's that's what it takes
And are we gonna employ tens of thousands of people to build a pyramid? I don't think so
We're gonna do it the more affordable way in our world
I mean this idea that we need to do the same thing to prove it is ridiculous
We know that people could move large stones
We've demonstrated how to cut and move large stones using that kind of technology that existed in the Bronze Age
It's really not rocket scientists. It's moving large stones and people are pretty capable of doing that
I mean, I've had to see people do that on our archaeological sites
You know, we excavate out, you know a several ton in marble inscription and we got to get it out of the trench
And you know the the local work men and women that do this on a regular basis
They know how to do this, you know, it's just ropes and and and you know muscle power and you know
They're moving a multi-ton inscription. I couldn't friggin do it
I wouldn't even know the first get bet but they know how to lever it and they know how to you know get it to
Shift on off its axis to get it start walking it out of a trench and then to pull it up with a series of ropes
Some people pushing some people pulling you get enough muscle power. You can move several tons stones
I've seen people do this. I always find this funny when people like archaeologists don't know this stuff
They're not like stone masons or something like that
They've never seen how to move large stones and it's like how do you think all those large stones?
You see lying around an archaeological site when you go visit the Giza or the Acropolis and Athens or wherever
You see many tons stones sitting around usually in stone piles
Those were probably moved in the 19th century most of them by hand by people by a crew of workers
Using nothing more than muscle power and I've seen it with my own eyes people moving several ton large stones
I've even helped out on a rope, you know, I've never been in charge of moving one
But I've helped out on a rope and so it's just like this idea that it's something so impossible
Just it makes no sense
So we have to move these stones all the time when we encounter one in an archaeological site and we need to get it out
Of the way, you know, I don't know how else to put it. That's what we have to do. And so yeah
Thank you for that as far as Graham Hancock's position goes he kind of admitted
We don't have any evidence of that advanced civilization now on this episode though
He goes through an entire Netflix series and written many books
Making the statement that we have this evidence
I know that because I've seen people who've quoted his book on Twitter
They're showing the references and stuff where he made bold claims seems like he's backpedaling
But my question is what evidence do we have again for
Civilizations around the time they're claiming an advanced one exists. It's just hunter-gatherers
Yeah, at that time so they're claiming in the ice age all we have is hunter-gatherers all around the world
We have thousands and thousands of sites, you know
I mean, I think I showed the Paleolithic radiocarbon database of Europe which stretches all the way to Siberia has something like
13,000 sites in it and so from the ice age and they're all hunter-gatherer look house
And so it's just it's it's it's you know, we have so much evidence for hunter-gatherers
We have it in the places that he says we're not looking we have you know
Hunter-gatherer sites in the Amazon from that period. We have hunter-gatherer sites in the Sahara from that period
We have hunter-gatherer sites from the coastlines of that period and we have hunter-gatherer sites that we found under water
From that period, you know time and time again. We have these sites and so that's what we have
I mean, I tend to think that civilization is a misnomer. We don't really use that term very frequently in archaeology anymore
It's just something that too many people have defined in too many ways
So it's become kind of meaningless and so we've kind of learned that things like
Agriculture sedentism urbanism working with larger architecture all these things advance and change
I should say advances even a misnomer at a separately in different regions at different times if you see what I mean
So it's not like there's some sort of complete package
Once they sort of all occur together in the in the Middle East in the Southwest Asia
Then they move with people as a package that we call the Neolithic package
But you know the development of each of those different technologies and phenomena in Southwest Asia sort of happens independently
same one thing in Mesoamerica, South America
East Asia etc and so you know in different areas of
Domestication and sedentism and urbanism and you know different ways of working in stone
And so you know this idea of civilization that's that that's why we see it as a misnomer too often
What we do is what people in the past did archaeologists and scholars is they drew this line between
Civilization and primitive savages and you know that that idea is not how we think of hunter-gatherers either
What we've learned is that hunter-gatherers are actually fairly complex
You know they're doing some quite amazing things to survive and thrive in tough landscapes and sometimes not in tough landscapes
And when they're when they are surviving and thriving at times
They're building fantastic large monuments like at go Bethlehem and so you know we see hunter-gatherers have this kind of know-how and
So there's no reason to assume that you know, they're not civilized if you see what I mean
Yeah, yeah, that's what I was gonna ask you about go Becky Tepe as it
It really was a shocker as people started discovering when this was being this structure was made
the question I have is do
Do we have anything that goes way further back that a stone monuments of some sort or at least resembling this kind of
Building structure from hunter-gatherers and then if we don't
Would it be a shock to discover that we maybe there are some structures similar to like what we see with go back to Tepe
Going back three four thousand years before that into the ice age area or a time frame
Yeah, so um, well first off with Rebecca Tepe. It's actually less of a shock
Then I don't know that's everybody on YouTube makes out to be yeah
You know, I
Actually wonder if this comes from Graham Hancock treating it so magnanimously
I mean a little bit from the excavators. They trumpeted it and it was an amazing find
I'm not trying to say that it's not a super cool site
But what it has is monumental architecture and we'd already discovered
monumental architecture from the same time period nearby so you know you have a
What if I tell us Sultan Jericho also known as Jericho Kathleen Kenyan excavated that in the 1960s
From the exact same time period as go Bethlehem Tepe there
We actually have agriculturalists sedentary people unlike go Bethlehem Tepe where there's hunter-gatherers and there there's monumental
architecture it's a different kind of style, but they have an enormous tower there and
parts of a wall and stuff like that that are, you know extremely monumental and just as large and impressive as go Bethlehem
Tepe and similarly this kind of T shaped megalithic structures
Go Bethlehem Tepe was not the first one found Klaus Schmidt who excavated it go Bethlehem Tepe
Previously excavated never leave never leave shoring and which had which is also
I think hunter-gatherers with the same type of monumental architecture dates a little later than go Bethlehem Tepe
But it's just a little bit later like a few hundred years and and it's the same style and everything
It's just not it wasn't as impressively complete if you see what I mean
It was so we had it there we could reconstruct it in our mind's eye
But it was not as complete and impressive looking as go Bethlehem Tepe
And that's part of what makes it so so impressive is is it stands out in the eyes if you see what I mean
And that's good for showing what it is
We definitely and so in that situation even in the same area
We have clear evidence of for thousands of years before go Bethlehem Tepe of the Natufian culture
Starting to live semi sedentary
Lives hunter-gatherers. They're not agriculturalists, but they're starting to sort of play with cultivating plants
So they're sort of helping them out, but they're not actually harvesting them and then planting them if you see what I mean
But they're but they're you know
Trying to help them out in different ways
Sometimes with fire sometimes in other sorts of ways and so we know that they're harvesting these wild plants intensively
They're storing them even so that they can be consumed over months and maybe even future years
They're grinding them and processing them intensively just like a go Bethlehem Tepe and they're also starting to build more
Larger and larger structures. They're not as impressive as go Bethlehem Tepe
But they show the development in that region of different sort of architectural skills and know-how
If you see what I mean, but most of their structures were sort of more for storage
things like that less
This kind of ceremonial type structures that sort of stand out like the tower at Jericho or like the
Enclosures that go Bethlehem Tepe. Yeah, is it safe to say that the time on their hands to build structures like that is
Due to them knowing how to
Store more food to be able to eat more because they're not preoccupied with every single day
9 to 9 not no 9 to 5 9 to 9 or 5 to whenever it's dark hunting to get food
They find better ways to preserve it store it and now they have a little more time on their hands to do other activities
Yeah, I think so. I mean in that area in particular these different groups of people had found very successful niches
So, you know echo Bethlehem Tepe
They found this niche where you know in the spring they come up there when the weather starts getting nice from the lowlands to the
Uplands and at that time the the grain is ready to harvest
it would have been harvestable earlier in the lowlands if you see what I mean because it's warmer and
So they come to the uplands and staggered harvest therefore of this kind of wild wheat that's growing and then you wait a few months
They store that that that wild wheat they grind it. They might ferment it in the beer
They might turn it into porridge that kind of stuff is the evidence we have and then a few months later the
Gazelle come through the past and so we can tell exactly what month they're coming through from the isotopic signatures and the kill-off patterns
that zoarchaeologists have studied and so we we actually can therefore tell when they're up there
They're up there for the warm parts of the season
So they're moving sort of seasonally between the love the lowlands in the colder seasons and then the uplands in the warmer seasons
To exploit these different niches and then while they're there they have plentiful time. They harvest that wheat it stores
They're waiting for those gazelle to come through and so right nearby is the quarries for it
The that they get the stone to build go Bethlehem Tepe and they have time on their hands and you know
They do this they follow this seasonal way of life for it's over a thousand years at that site
You know, so you think about it from today to like, you know, what the end of the Roman Empire, right?
That's the amount of time I think even longer that they're at this site
And so, you know, so much time to be able to
Develop this kind of ceremonial center and then of course, you know
The the team is now starting to excavate further away from the ceremony center and and Graham says oh my god
The the the older buildings are nicer than the next buildings and it's like that's because this is the ceremonial center
And then the other buildings are just where they're living and where they're grinding their grain and storing their grain
And of course, you know, you go to any city and you have a ceremonial center
That's built, you know, like in Washington, DC in the 19th century
And then you have other areas built in the 20th century that aren't as grand as what we built in the 19th century
And that doesn't mean our technology is more inferior, you know
It's because that that's when that ceremonial
Center was constructed and they maintained it if you see what I mean, there was no reason to update it
And so, I mean that happens all the time in different cities and settlements throughout the world
And I mentioned because I know there are friends of mine who are into this alternative stuff who think that look at the
Look at the stones under civilizations that come later
Massive stones for example the Herodian aspect of the of the Jewish temple and remnants that are left of it
Those stones are massive the Herodian stones are massive
Then you can go to the later civilizations who built on it stacking smaller blocks
And you go well, it's an inferior build compared to Herodians
And it's actually the opposite probably, you know, you look at sort of cultures and technology over time
We've always gone from sort of larger things to smaller more modular things and you can see that today
We're building with concrete, right?
You know where it's it's become dust that we can manipulate however you want it building with smaller stones and
Mortar and things like that is actually going to be more sturdy
It's going to be more easy to repair over time. And so, you know, this idea of larger stones is more superior technology
It's actually the exact opposite
Everywhere you look it goes from kind of larger stones to smaller stones because smaller stones are are more efficient and
And more repairable and they're more sturdy
You know, and so this this this misnomer that I don't know these people sell as if large stones somehow mean superior technology
And I just don't get it. If everywhere you look it's the exact opposite
According to Dr. Cooney in Egypt the the initial dynasties are building these
Magnificent pyramids and then, you know, the argument they'll usually make is look at these raunchy little
half-ass pyramids that come later
They they must have lost this secret technology again, right this kind of argumentation and she's like
It's her opinion and I suspect other
Egyptologists who say actually what's going on is they already have their dynasty established
Here's this massive ass, you know constructions. We don't need to like compete with that
We'll make our own little like here's my little pyramid that represents me in my kingdom
But like these are already magnificently done
We don't need to keep making this kind of structure
It's already happened and how much money time and energy that went into that
it almost became a way to
This symbolizes my dynasty and my ruling as well
Even though they were initially used for initial pharaohs another way of putting it is
This is a little more complex, but in biblical literature
You had this back when the kings ruled and the gods ordained the kings to be in power
It wasn't just Bible we're talking about Sputamia, Syria, Babylon
The gods gave the kings the rights and it was always like this is God given to the kings later when there were no more kings
in the Judean regions the scribes
Take that authority that was once a kingly thing and attributed to the missile
Well in ancient Egypt you could say later kings later pharaohs are just
Taking the earlier clout that comes from these massive structures and applying it to themselves and saying
Do I do I really need to go and build that again? I mean it's already there
You know and you know look look styles and attitudes change you could look at the development of phones over time
And they're initially these massive fucking things and then eventually they become smaller and smaller
Then we get the touchscreen and now they become bigger again because there's you know
It's it's it's style and fads. You can see this with cars
You know there's big big cars, but then you get a sports car and it's a tiny little thing
You know the size and stuff like that that the styles change
What people do to impress other people changes over time?
There's no reason to think that you know the only way to express power is through having the largest monument
you know there's so many different ways to express your status and your power and your wealth and
Sometimes it's through very small things and subtle ways
Others times is through something more in your face and it's just sort of you know
I don't understand why we think there's only one way to do something that's more impressive than another
It's it's a very reductive way of thinking about our ancestors. Yeah
the final point I'd like to make is I've engaged with many people online from various stripes and
Oftentimes there's this accusation of people like me. I call myself an atheist
Who say you know they want to put the burden of proof on me and many atheists online go well
We we don't we're not the ones who have to bear the burden
You you need to prove the existence of this omniscient omnibenevolent, you know the arguments
I'm sure you've seen them online. Everyone has come across this stuff
But in your case, it's a special kind of position in my opinion
I could make a case a strong positive case
Against the existence of Yahweh, which I have done in a recent documentary. I just launched in this case of archaeology
They want to shit, you know
You could easily just shift the burden and say you need to prove it exists
You haven't done that and he wants to do this God of the gaps kind of thing where it's like, you know
It's out there. You just haven't found it yet wishful thinking hopeful all of that. Is there evidence in your mind?
That isn't just shifting it back to them for them to carry the burden
But you think is definitive evidence that proves the case that we don't have these advanced civilizations
I thought I mentioned you I thought you mentioned something about ships being in water things
Yeah, there's a range of things I mean look so I didn't really treat this as a debate
I tried it taught it more as a classroom largest classroom I could ever have right, you know
I'm there I get a chance to actually teach what I do and so that's that was my real goal
It wasn't even and and and you know the the the idea of having to disprove his
Ideas which you know are never published in a sort of scientific way
So there's no reason to critique them in that kind of way as I mentioned
I mean look, he's very honest about being biased. He even has his blog on his website saying he doesn't he's not
He thinks of himself as a as an attorney a lawyer with his client being this lost civilization
And he wants to present this theory in the best light possible
So of course he's gonna be selective about his evidence if you see what I mean and so as I showed with those ed food texts
He's extremely selective putting together those sentences from different pages
And so I I really saw this as look at the there's no way to really debate
Somebody who's just categorically opposed to you know looking at archaeology in the way that scholars look at archaeology
And so I really used it as kind of an example to really teach
Archaeology to a large audience and of course I framed it around the topic of the conversation
Which was is there this lost civilization? And yeah, I definitely think there's strong archaeological evidence against it
I mean this is why I'm writing this book and and I'm gonna be you to be more about this topic is because you know
This this idea was considered seriously in scholarship in the 19th century and sort of discarded
But at this point we have so much more evidence, especially the last you know 50 70 100 years in many countries
where cultural heritage laws have been put into place and
The public just does not quite understand the scale of archaeological evidence that we have I mean, you know
So you Graham Hancock claims there's this global civilization
He says it's you know underwater because of sea level rise at the end of the Ice Age
And he critiques underwater archaeology because they've uncovered
You know thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of shipwrecks and he says but you're not finding many settlements
So you're you're doing the wrong thing if you want to test my
Hypothesis you should you should be looking for settlements underwater for Ice Age stuff underwater and it's sort of like wait a second
Hold on Graham. You're trying to say this is a global civilization where there's trade
Across the oceans and across the seas where are your shipwrecks if we're focused on finding shipwrecks
Well, there should be shipwrecks from your civilization
You know, this is just a no-brainer if we know how to find shipwrecks
And we're so successful at finding them from all the different periods where humans have ships
Well, what the heck where are yours, you know, and so that was one of my big ones
The other one is just to focus on all the coastal evidence
We have and even the underwater evidence we have from the Ice Age and stuff in the Sahara the tens and thousands hundreds of thousands of sites and
Millions of artifacts around the world and just say look we're we are able to predict
You know by looking at the geology of the landscape for areas to survey for stone age finds because we know there
There's exposed stone age soils due to erosion due to uplift due to different kinds of things and we go there
And we look and we find stone age stuff all the time whether it's coastlands whether it's in forests whether it's in
Deserts and we find this stuff and we're targeting this stuff. We're looking for it
But your stuff ain't there and then third of all as I brought up for in the middle
I think of the conversation is domestication and you know
It's sort of like you look at the evidence and this is not even new stuff
This is taught at like an intro level of how to how were plants domesticated?
We've known about this for 40 50 years since we first learned that we can recover these seeds
You know seeds that are carbonized in a sense by doing what's called flotation
We can sample some of the soil and all of our excavations come up with hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands sometimes
or even hundreds of thousands in some sites of these seeds right and so we know how that shift from the scar
Happens and how it falls off the plant and we've known about this since the 1980s with Gordon Hillman
And we started to understand through testing it ourselves
How this mechanism occurs because it's it's accidental. It's when we start planting those plants. There's this evolutionary
Adaptation this sort of pressure for the seed to stay on the plant
So it's collected and then replanted if you see what I mean and so we've yeah
One comment on that Joe tried to kind of get you to go deeper and I appreciated it
But I also fought in my head if I was this kind of alternative conspiracy theorist
I would want to know okay hold on is there a way to reverse that so if they stop doing this agricultural thing due to
Let's just say I don't know a catastrophe
For thousands of years did the plants come back to normal not having the scar you almost have an evolutionary process
Which he I loved his enthusiasm on being shocked how plants almost have a mind of their own in terms of the evolution process
But it it sounded like he was trying to leave open room for hey this catastrophe happens
Restart humans have to reboot takes a couple thousand years. No wonder the plants are back to normal again
And then they have to re-agricultural
Kind of giving well so what I was trying to get across
During the conversation and I don't think I did a good job answering this because I wasn't quite expecting it
May because chronologically time-wise it makes no sense like
The timing of this disaster Graham Hancock changes his mind on when this disaster occurs multiple times
Sometimes for a while he thought it occurred with meltwater pulse 1b, which is at the end of the Younger Dryas
Now he subscribes to the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis
Which is at the start of the Younger Dryas though we don't have evidence for much sea level rise at that time
And you give us dates just so people
Something I'd have to look it up exactly, but something like about
11,600 or 500 BCE
Okay, would be the start of the Younger Dryas and something like
1500-2000 years later is the end of the Younger Dryas and has that meltwater pulse 1b and the mechanics here
I didn't want to go into them because I'm not a geologist and I don't want to have to talk too much
I mean I'm in on the show the Joe Rogan thing. I'm happy to chat about it more casually here because I won't be challenged
But I don't want to be challenged on geology
I'm not an expert on it right and so you know the Younger Dryas we've known about for a while
It's a period where it actually gets colder and it goes back to kind of ice age like conditions
And so that's why there's more ice on the poles and actually the sea level doesn't go up
And so it's only at the end of the Younger Dryas when when it gets warmer again
And the poles melt that we get that meltwater pulse 1b
And so if you look at the timing for agriculture
There is no time for
This kind of reversion back to feral is the problem because we get our early signs of agriculture
During you know the Younger Dryas kind of period and so you know if this disaster happened
There's not thousands of years for this sort of feralization to occur to the start of domestication that we see right and another way
of putting it is before this
2000 let's just say a 2000 year block of catastrophe that they're claiming is like this really shift
Which it probably isn't by the way. It's just right. Yeah. Yeah, you were you were saying that too
That's a whole another show right? Yeah, maybe you can recommend one for me to dive into this
But like before that
If there was this massive civilization of some sort however
How you want to put it technological or even if it's not all that whatever to try and keep your position alive in the
Agricultural world you're saying the seeds we've discovered these are natural like they have not already
Domesticated this this there's no evidence
The other thing that I was thinking which I should have brought up to make it simpler
Sorry, I should have brought it up earlier here to make it simpler as we should be able to have the relic of that earlier
Domestication event in the DNA. So when you think about it when you domesticate a species
Only a small population has been selected by humans for planting
And so there's this genetic bottleneck that occurs if you see what I mean where where
the adaptation of that
Hanging on to the plant that provides a strong pressure a selective pressure
Which causes the descendants of that seed that has that mutation to be selected for and so that happens
Repeatedly with repeated plantings and what ends up happening is when you end up with a new population of domesticated wheat or whatever
It is rice or corn or or peas or beans or whatever
You end up with a very small
genetic subsection of the larger population that existed that was wild and so you see this bottleneck in
all kinds of in the DNA itself in a wide range of gene expressions and so
Yeah, it's sort of like, you know, if you think about it when humans left Africa
Humans leave Africa. It's just a small group of humans that leave Africa
There's much more genetic diversity in the group of humans that's left behind in Africa than the small group that goes out of Africa
And still to this day, there's much more genetic diversity in African populations than in non African populations because of that
What's called a founder effect the founding population moves out
It's just a small percentage of the all the genes that existed in the larger population that stay behind and so, you know
It's the same thing with with with
Domestication we we the plants in a sense have the selection pressure only a small percentage of them meet that selection pressure and therefore
What ends up domesticated goes through this genetic bottleneck and so we can track track that very easily in the genes of domesticated plants
But that would also have a relic in the wild population
We'd be able to see this if you see what I mean in the diversity of different
Plants that we have that are wild and collected in this period and we yeah
Nell this down just so everyone is following to make this very simple in the wild
life of plants
Before the younger dryest claims to have happened which we're saying claims because that's what
Graham is trying to run with there is no evidence of any
domesticated wild plants being domesticated
Anywhere before this time by human civilizations period in the genetic there's there's certainly evidence of gathering
There's certainly evidence of helping those plants thrive in their natural environment in a sense
But there's no evidence of agriculture in the sense of planting and so nowhere
He tried to like go okay, hold on maybe they didn't do that they're shamanistic you notice
Yeah, maybe they didn't actually teach them. Maybe they didn't actually bring agriculture
They just showed them that it was possible
Okay, then how did they know it was possible and and you know, I also want to be clear unlike stone you we can and we do
Radiocarbon gate seats there are organic material we can radiocarbon date them directly and we every single time we run a DNA test
We also radiocarbon date the stuff that's standard operation operating
Procedures for labs and we radiocarbon date these seeds all the time
And so we have direct dates of these wild and domesticated seeds. Yeah
Dr. Flint devil I I really hope that another round can happen
And I say with you and Joe that would be a fascinating conversation
Let Joe bring his critical questions let him challenge let him kind of but like without
getting
Distracted by some of Graham stuff. Let Joe bring his own stuff. I'd love to see another episode because I want more
Good scholarship to be popular. In fact mid-fission due to its origins being kind of in the alternative pseudo
Explanations of things becoming someone who's growing up realizing whoa the people who are actually closer to what is taking place
Are the academics in the field and I think that that's a good rule of thumb because what is the consensus on this?
Well, why why do they think that and then if you disagree with that have good reasons to think you know what you think don't go
Starting pseudo starting alternative and then work backwards even though I'm not gonna knock it because that's the path that I kind of took
I I feel like an analogy is
Jake Paul for those who've never been in a boxing they go through the route of someone like Jake Paul to get into boxing
Hopefully we can look at a light at the end of the tunnel and say maybe Graham Hancock is actually creating fans of a serious scholarship. I
Know that I'm trying to be optimistic. Oh, I mean
I I know some archaeologists that started off liking and reading Graham and then went to university and took some courses
And then they realized oh, this is actually all the evidence we have and the way archaeologists look at it
It works by and large and they're constantly testing it and working to improve it
And you know, that's what we do. We have a huge amount of evidence
I really I that's the kind of thing that that I think people don't quite understand is just the scale and amount of evidence
We have and how much we've had to test the ways we you know apply
chronology to pottery typology and we know we
We're constantly testing that and we're constantly refining it and improving it
But it works by and large same thing with stone tools same thing with seeds same thing with bones
Same thing with different kind of soils things same thing with different methods now like DNA and isotopes
You know, we actually have built huge databases that that the public doesn't quite understand because
Obviously these technologies are so new that we're still in the process of publishing those huge data sets these sort of projects
That if you're not at a conference you wouldn't even know about if you see what I mean
And so they're slowly coming out, you know data sets of I think I just saw one published of isotopes in the Caribbean
And it's something like 20,000 different isotope samples have now been published just in the Caribbean
And so it's like, you know that that's just isotope analysis
You know imagine all the bones in the teeth that that those isotopes came from different species different plants different animals and humans
And so, you know, it's just sort of like we we have this really big
Robust set of evidence and we're constantly improving on it and as we should be, you know
That's what we do. Our job is to keep interrogating our evidence for the best and improving
The ways we go about it the methods and questions we ask and then what we can say about it
We're constantly rewriting history as I like to say, you know, that's what we do. Yeah
Well, thank you so much dr. Flint devil ladies and gentlemen go subscribe to his youtube channel follow him on twitter x
Are there any other platforms that people can follow you or check you out at that?
You right? Yeah, just started doing instagram since people followed me on there. So I guess instagram as well. Yeah
Awesome. I really appreciate your knowledge
I'm sure we have more to get into
In ancient greece and connections. You're going to be interviewing with my dear friend nil from gnostic informant
He is oh, yeah. Yeah
He loves the greek stuff. I love it too, but uh, he's jumping on that with you
And i'm sure we can do some stuff as well down the road
I'm curious by the way on getting when you talk about oral traditions
Maybe a future episode talking about the earlier hit-type version of the trojan war and maybe possibly even getting into how greeks
Competed orally in their myths with the ancient near east because I know that bruce loudon
I don't know if you've ever heard of him
He wrote a book called homers odyssey in the near east and in it. He actually goes to try and show that
No other ancient near eastern story compares or parallels
to homers odyssey more than the bible and
I love that because I see some interesting overlap in the way that the themes and genres and the motifs and stuff are working
I don't know about making any genetic arguments because it's harder to try and do but like
Something's going on where there's some communication going on between these people and a lot of scholars in bible arena
want to go well the linguistics are so foreign because that's like
Proto-Indo-European type language and this is more semitic and therefore they can't be
Discussing on that level until hellenism and i'm going
If that's the case, we see look there's a ton of contacts between the greek world and the near east
I mean look this kind of storytelling stuff is not what I do as much
That might be a little tough for me to talk about that with the hit type traditions
But I can certainly talk about the kind of contacts that existed and certainly before hellenism, you know
We even call it the orientalizing period, which is basically the seventh century
BC where you see this huge influx of ideas
motifs
From the east to the west and then different things going from Greece back to the near east
There's a lot of contact in those periods sort of right when the old testament is is forming at the same time when
The ilian and the odyssey is forming and then certainly with the new testament that's in a that's it that's under the you know
Yeah, after years of of hellenization and romanization
So yeah, so you see that kind of stuff
But yeah, there's look the the Mediterranean is a
Is a very diverse place three different continents meet there and people are moving around so much because it's so easy to move by water
You know the they were quite expert at traversing the sea from the Bronze Age onwards and even before the Bronze Age
But especially from the Bronze Age onwards. Yeah
Thank you. Like this video share this out with somebody and hopefully Joe Rogan takes a peek and has you back
Thank you. Dr. Flint Dibble. Thank you so much Derek. I appreciate it
