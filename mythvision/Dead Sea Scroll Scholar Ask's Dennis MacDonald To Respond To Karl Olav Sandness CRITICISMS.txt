Dennis McDonald, thank you again for joining me. I got a heck of a question from a Dead Sea Scroll
scholar who's also a patron of mine. Matthew Munger, thank you so much for the question to Dennis
and I can't wait to hear his response to this. Consider joining the Patreon if you haven't
already. We could use your help to keep this stuff going. Question, Matthew Munger says,
One of my colleagues in Oslo, Carl Olav Sannez, has been one of Dennis's most open critics.
I tend to agree with Dennis that there is too much literary similarity between the
Gospels and Homer Virgil to ignore, but how does Dennis respond to Sannez's criticism
that the parallels to Homer and Virgil are too veiled to be obvious to the reader and thus
ineffective as Mimesis? Matthew, that is such an important question and I'm so glad you asked it.
So it gives me an opportunity to engage you and maybe Carl Olav as well. I consider him to be
a formidable opponent and I consider him to be a friend and I admire his scholarship and in fact
for his most recent book on the mericentos I wrote an endorsement and so we have, I wouldn't say
buried the hatchet, but I think we can sustain a friendship with each other and mutual admiration.
He is a fine trained classicist. His Greek is excellent and his grasp of what's going on
not just with Homer and Greek literature but also with patristic literature is very impressive
and he also writes on the New Testament I'm sure, but his primary contributions have been
as a classicist to understand the reception of let's say the Homeric epics and the Homeric
entones and the book that I endorsed was a very interesting theological assessment of how the
poets, especially Eftosia, the earliest female centoist, construed the gospel story by using
Homeric lines and to changing the narrative. One of the brilliant pieces is that Judas becomes
really a character as the devil and there are other very subtle and important shifts so I
have great respect for him and would not want to identify my differences from him
with a diminishment of my appreciation for him but I do differ with him
and in order to give a better answer I'm going to appeal to recent works
especially by Robin Faith Walsh who has argued that the gospel authors are not,
they're actually intellectuals that are engaged with the intellectual project of writing for
other intellectuals and not for Christian communities without educated people
and so that the readership of if Robin is right and I'm sure that she is and from my perspective
the readership of the gospels was better educated, more sophisticated than we usually
give credit for. The other is that I would insist that Homer was more ubiquitous in the
culture than just in what people learned in school. It was sometimes in the theaters,
it was in artwork, the culture was saturated with it so one did not have to, so one of the things
Matthew that Carl does and it's very helpful actually I've used it is to talk about the
use of Homer in schools and where it played a role in higher Greek society and that's been
very helpful but I would, from my perspective the parallels are so strong especially in Mark
and Luke and Luke Axe that the author had to expect some of the readers to appreciate the
intellectual playfulness and alternatives of the Christian story to those among the Greeks
that the readership had to include at least enough intellectuals to make that enterprise
available. Now other people like Tom Brody and others have said it doesn't matter about the
intellectual properties of the audience it has to do with the intellectual capacities only of the
author that the author benefits by writing things for oneself that are indebted to the
Homeric epics or to tragedy or whatever. I don't buy that I think that these parallels are
per minutically and theologically fraught they are carrying some kind of freight and for that
to happen you have to have somebody receiving the freight on the other end that he has that
intellectual capacity. The the objections by Carl Olaf are similar to those of Margaret Mitchell
and they get repeated over and over again and this is why I so welcome Robin Faith Walsh's
reassessment of the intellectual register of gospel authors because I think we've been
dumbing down on them far too much. So anyway that's my read on Carl Olaf I respect him he's a
wonderful fellow I think we are friendly combatants but I do think that the authors and recipients of
the Gospels had more sophistication than Carl is willing to grant. I have to jump in now and I
haven't done this yet but this is a question that I have to say I am not an expert I don't know Greek
I am an ignoramus when it comes to the language okay and I'm reading this I'm reading the narrative
I don't need to get the Xerox copy of this Greek word it's the same Greek word like practically
the same Greek words right sometimes you can find parallels you might find a similar Greek words
and words the themes the narratives the motifs the pictures like it overwhelmingly seems like
there's garrison de maniac right I'm like blown away at the comparison I'm blown away
right then I start looking at other examples from Jesus's death to his baptism and empowerment to
what else I mean there's so many of these examples I don't know why anyone I don't understand I don't
get it and to me I don't know I just don't get it what do you think it is I have two responses
through you one is if people want to know about polyphemus they do not have to read Odyssey 9
a polyphemus is an artwork you know it's a it's a famous story so you don't have to be
educated to read Odyssey 9 in order to understand the the polyps theme of story I am looking at this
not as an expert right but I there are some things I know right I know that they had to
know this literature in order to learn Greek I know this I don't need to know Greek to know
that they had to know this which would make me go whoa big big suspect so I honestly I mean
this is me psychoanalyzing this is my problem this is my fault I tend to psychoanalyze I wonder
what motivations people have for not actually seeing well so I can't judge people's motivations
but I can I do remember what I was going to say please take me back this is why Lucian
is so important in his satires Lucian satires are full of satires of the Homeric epics more than
any other literature and for the satire to work he has to expect that his readers know the story
of polyphemus and seercy in the going to the netherworld and Homer's ascendancy and so on so these
stories are out there now to be sure Lucian may be writing for other intelligentsia but we don't
know that the gospel authors weren't writing for intelligentsia and so yeah yeah and you don't need
to have a declaration I'm now going to imitate the odyssey to know that a monster who lives in caves
um is going to be trouble and the hero is going to escape somehow so um but I that's one reason I
really love Lucian uh Lucian satires are just a treasure for understanding popular reception of
the Homeric epics thank you dr monger appreciate your question this is a really good one I really
appreciate it and consider joining the patreon ladies and gentlemen be sure to sign up for Dr
Dennis R McDonald's Greek mimesis in the New Testament course reading the gospels with one eye
on Greek poetry Dennis spends 18 lectures diving into several parallels building up the methodology
to show you his methods and how he sees that the New Testament authors cleverly rewrite and really
make Jesus such a better figure than what we see in the older Greek myths and their poetry you can
sign up today own it for life there are several hours well over eight hours of content in this
course with 18 lectures Dennis gives you so much to read and look up and consider in investigating
did the New Testament authors actually imitate the Greek epics to write their narratives about
Jesus there's several reading recommendations additional resources under every single one
of the lectures you can download one through 18 on mp3 in case you want to just download it and have
it in your your whatever the device might be in order to work and listen at the same time you don't
have to just see it but if you decide to watch the content it is all in 4k extremely high quality
content as you can see and you did it in from we have a greek latin uh the audio is nice and
takes you through his book and it takes a deep dive be sure to sign up today i hope you will
this helps Dennis mcdonald and it helps educate the world on what's going on in scholarship
