Dennis McDonald. I have a question from a guy named Lawrence. Not sure if he wants me to give out his full name because he messaged me
I'm what's known as elapsed Catholic
Some would say apostate. I haven't heard anything on your show about you are Peter and
Upon you I shall build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail
I don't have the quote exactly, but you know the one
Catholics believe this to be the actual beginning of the Roman Catholic Church, but I think that's just ridiculous
I don't believe Jesus actually ever said this, but the words were interpolated later by God the gospel writers
I tell Catholics the best you can say Jesus founded might be another sect of Judaism
Love your show. Hope your move is going well. So I'm gonna rephrase this question without asking. Did Jesus say this or not?
Taking this to you, which most likely he probably didn't say but anyway, who knows
Does this play into any of your Greek?
Connections in this this passage
No, it doesn't play into the the Greek
Mythology and so on I would say the Homeric epics or whatever, but it is a fascinating
Trajectory and Lawrence I'm so glad you asked the question
And I think the quest ought to begin with the Q document
And I know not all the viewers and maybe not you yourself Lawrence hold to the Q hypothesis
But in my view the Q document considers the 12 to be
exemplary
transmitters of the kingdom of God's message
after Jesus's death and
Peter is named along with the other 12 in the Q document in my view. It's Q plus. It's not
traditional cues and
all of them
None is singled out for special attention
And so Peter is there with them as a trustworthy transmitter of the tradition
But all of them are and they travel two by two
in the proclamation
The Q the Gospel of Mark comes along and he does not like that
the in fact the 12 are
Include Judas Iscariot
Who is the betrayer?
Peter who denies Jesus three times
the women never tell the disciples to go to Galilee
and so they never see the risen Jesus and
James or Jacob and John asked us that if Jesus is right in left hands and it's the the
The the thieves that are at Jesus is right in left hand. So the
12
Disciples including Peter are losers and
Peter is the biggest loser other than than Judas
So Matthew comes along and he's looking for a
Reliable transmitter of the tradition from the 12 and from Jesus himself
And it's in the Gospel of Mark where Jesus
Where Peter Jesus says to the disciples, who do you say that I am and Peter says that you are the Christ of the Son of God
and so on there are variations on that and
Matthew takes that as an opportunity to say that Peter is the coolest
He's the one it's on either for on him or on his confession
that the church is going to be built and
so it also then you have the the keys of
What is bound in heaven is bound on earth and so on so it certainly is secondary
It doesn't come from the cue document
It does not come from Mark directly
But it's a spin-off of what we find in the the Gospel of Mark
Now, but let's go back to the Gospel of Mark
This passage is really quite interesting and I know Derek is going to have something to say because of the confession
accessory of Philippi that we've talked about before and I'm going to ask him to pick up on that in a minute
But the other is that we have in mark several
Recognitions of Jesus's identity
One of them is by the woman who anoints Jesus for his death
That's based on the Eureklai episode and
we're she's
in in the
Issue of Simon Peter the disciples are not to tell anybody that Jesus is the
The Messiah even though Peter gets it right
So you do have that kind of echo of the Odyssey
Where Jesus and Odysseus have kept their identity a secret
Then when people find it out, they are commanded to secrecy
but Matthew is looking for
a
member of the 12
That can be a representative leader after Jesus's death
For the community now the Gospel of John's very interested in this way
Because the last the epilogue the last chapter of the Gospel of John
Jesus says to Peter a shepherd my sheep
But he's not the most important apostle in the the fourth Gospel
It's the beloved disciple who's the one who has the inside track
So here you find a competition between the fourth Gospel and the synoptics where Matthew
favors Peter and he becomes the
patron saint of the Petrine Church
Whereas the beloved disciple becomes the patron saint of the so-called
Johanine tradition and then you have the Pauline tradition, of course
Which is a different issue and we haven't talked about the Gospel of Thomas
So the Thomas becomes identified and in the history of Christendom
We find various apostles being championed as the heroes that are faithful the most faithful
Transmitters of Jesus's legacy and Matthew is the first person is far. We know to have singled out
Peter as
The one who's the most authoritative transmitter of the Jesus tradition
But Derek do you want to say something about Caesarea Philippi sure?
so I
Guess the first thing I would want to say is isn't it ironic that tradition has Peter attached to Mark and
Really they would have been just wise to say. Oh, yeah, Peter's attached to Matthew
Way better chances at this point you screwed yourself because it I would say your best guess is
Paul's attached to Mark at best
Okay, and we talked about that earlier in in our course as I told you about my article Caesarea Philippi
So that's a free appeal if Caesarea Philippi is it's it's located up in the northern Galilee
it's
Good little distance not too too far from the Sea of Galilee Lake of Galilee you could travel on foot
I mean, it'll take you a little while, but this is how they did it back in the day
And in this area here the great
Built a fortress actually a temple to
Caesar Augustus and so when when let's just put it this way when things didn't pan out with his previous buddy
Who was enemies of Caesar Augustus? Of course he kissed
Augustus and said you want to let's see you can kill me and you probably want to I get it
But if you make me if you keep me alive and spare me, I'll show you how true a friend I am and of course
King Herod really showed it
From maritime Caesarea to Caesarea Philippi, but here in this region where he built the temple
to Augustus
For Augustus Augustus is alive
There's the temple of Pan and there's a portal literally a spring that comes out
If the water rises and falls depending on the time of the year and right there at this scene in Caesarea Philippi
The this is where we went with Dr.
James Tabor and he stood there and he said look around
What would you have seen all of these other gods sons of gods and gods and men gods even Caesars
And Jesus says, you know, who do men say that I am?
I'm I'm competing
I'm in town, baby. You know watch out. This is how they paint it. It's so good and
It put chills on my arms because I was like
Here's this this Jewish guy, you know like coming in out of nowhere and he's like who do men say that I am
And they're like a some say John the Baptist some say Elijah some say the prophet and
Then he's like you're the son of the living God Peter does confess
But even then Jesus takes the confession from him right out the game is
You didn't know this flesh and blood did not reveal this to you
My father told you because his father tells him at the beginning of the story, you know, you are the son
You are my son. So no, no Peter doesn't know this only father knows this
Of course, he reveals this and actually confesses it on the Mount of Transfiguration as you well teach
In this course, but I just thought that was really ironic because it tells you
while this author may not be the most
Careful about all the details when we talk about the Lake of Galilee the Sea of Galilee
This seems like at least they're aware in some way that Caesarea Philippi
Has temples to other gods include in Caesar Augustus which mark jabs at Caesar and
By copying or borrowing or memetically
Adapting somehow the Aeneid as you show in the course, which you're gonna have to get the course
Like there's so much that you did that highlighted when I stood there now. I'm like
This son of a gun
What a slick smart author and it's great. So be on the lookout get the course
