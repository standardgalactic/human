Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen author of many books I've got some patreon member questions and
this will be the first recording we do whether I launch it first or not doesn't matter Andy
are already sorry already Hagan asks for Dr. Joshua Bowen much of the Bible seems tenuous
from a contemporary historical perspective which is the earliest story event or person
in the Bible that would that would you consider to reflect potentially reliable history what
would be the likely date of that narrative and when was the narrative likely written
yeah the question of the historical veracity of stories in the Hebrew Bible sort of like
the perennial question or it always comes up and the rule of thumb I guess that I think
most scholars would say is that the further back in the further back in time that the
narrative takes you the less reliable it is so you know on one extreme you go back to
Genesis one and two and the creation accounts you know least reliable maybe like that whole
primeval history era at least reliable and then you know coming down into like the post
exilic period you know that's much more reliable right so and and there's sort of a time I
think that most scholars would probably say that once you get into like definitely by
the 8th century maybe by the 9th you know what the Bible is is is described with the
Hebrew Bible is describing is obviously take out the supernatural stuff but you know it's
pretty close and and I would say even you know the Davidic stories while I don't think that
they represent an accurate historical depiction in the sense that it is something without spin
I think Joel Baden would argue pretty pretty convincingly he's got a book out on this talking
about David that the stories themselves represent a type of historical reality that again is has
been subjected to this sort of political spin and so you know you end up with a text that takes
something that has David acting as essentially like a mob boss and spins it in such a way that the
bad guy becomes the good guy and the good guy becomes the bad guy and I so I I think that for
me just the general thumb if you're talking about the patriarchs talking about the primeval
history talking about the exodus the exodus is probably the place that it starts to make a turn
and what I mean by that is like everybody relax all of you out there relax the exodus I think
probably represents it's it the story itself contains probably a kernel of truth right a
current it's probably remembering some sort of historical reality or based on some sort of
historical reality so I mean like we know that Semitic peoples were slaves in Egypt we know that
Semitic people escaped from Egypt and and we know that Egypt was of course in control of
Canaan for much of the second half of the second millennium so I think those those historical
truths those historical realities more than likely informed this memory that the exodus
seeks to or that the exodus was built upon or built up around so yeah that's what I would say
patriarchs primeval history you know I don't really hold a lot of I don't think they hold a lot of
water I don't know that there was a Moses figure it doesn't really matter to me if there was um
you know if there was great I don't really care um the legend that's built it's it's sort of I
I think of Moses oh slightly differently but pretty close to how I think about Gilgamesh
in the sense that like I actually think we have pretty decent evidence for Gilgamesh
um but it doesn't matter like it wouldn't matter to me if tomorrow archaeologists said hey we
actually have really good evidence that there was a Moses a person named Moses like in the 13th
century or something because that doesn't then mean in the same way that it doesn't mean that
because there was a Gilgamesh that all the things that are said about him are now suddenly true
you know all the supernatural things that he did in the same way if Moses suddenly turned
up as a real person or even Abraham or Isaac or Jacob that that the stories that built up around
them reflect historical reality so I guess that's how I would answer that question so to put it simply
for those who were probably watching going would you say that maybe the Moses tradition
is the oldest or guy this is this is an easy to answer I mean it's putting itself in
approximately and I I'm giving the Hyksos guys a little credit here 1500 to 1200 but really 1200s
BCE um it's saying as if it's during this time but as far as like when you when do you think
we don't have any doubts like when do you get to a guy and go that without a doubt the earliest
you can think of um where you go okay we have no reason to think Ezra didn't exist or or has a
kaya or you know when do you say the earliest we are pretty definite based on other sources as well
to say this guy existed I mean I would like I I do think if you're asking like consensus scholarship
I don't know that I've thought about it enough to give that answer I think most everybody would
probably say the divided monarchy is pretty or pretty solid foot in the house of Omri
I mean we have like the Jehu uh the stele that's got Jehu on his knees
so I do think that I I'm sorry that I'm not more articulate these these questions I'm kind of
getting them as you say them right so I haven't had time to really prep anything but um and that's
what I'd like to do is look back over my notes but um like I I think that David those things reflect
historical reality probably constant contemporary historical accounts but again they're heavily
spun so you can't just you know you you can't go reading Hittite Apologia right you can't read
uh you know what these Hittite kings say about um you know the events that that brought them to power
and say oh well that must be exactly how this happened that's not that's not the kids not how
historiography works but yeah I mean I would say the divided monarchy probably most mainline scholars
would say we're I'm pretty sure footing Leicester uh gravy has a really good book on this a really
good recent book on this um but also like William Deaver's book did the did archaeology bury the
bible um you know I think he he he goes through sort of the archaeological evidence that we have
for things like the house of David or Jeroboam, Rayoboam you know those sorts of things so I
think the David thing just on that note is like you talked about being spun and then people will go
well if he did exist right uh it's evidence because you see embarrassment right and so there's
there's some interesting points to be made here that Joel Baden discusses when he says
look you can say well it wasn't embarrassing then but why is Chronicles spinning it then
so there seems to have may have been a guy but not necessarily a kingdom but maybe there was a guy in
a small little something uh in the south or in the or even in the north but the north was bigger
than the south so yeah I mean I this this is sort of the the thing that always puzzles me and it
it puzzles me about the whole Jesus is the historical figure was he you know myth that whole
debate it's odd to me because I get to the end and I say so what and again putting it back in the
terms of Gilgamesh like I I can't imagine somebody vehemently fighting for Gilgamesh being an actual
figure like an actual person in a third millennium a king over Uruk and like fighting tooth and nail
either to make him a historical figure to say he was a myth um because like at the end of the day
so what um because everybody would say whether he's a real guy or not he didn't race through
you know race the sun through a tunnel he didn't go you know cross the deadly sea to reach
him um he didn't fight the bull of heaven you know he he wasn't proposed to by the goddess Ishtar
he wasn't two-thirds divine like this is the point um so whether that individual is a historical
figure which again I think he is uh or not is sort of it it's one of those things that's
if you're coming at somebody like Jesus you're coming at somebody like Moses
as an apologist and you're trying to make the argument this is a historical person
what I often see is the reason that they do that is see he's a historical person
therefore he walked on water and it's like wait a minute wait a minute like you don't go to
Spiderman and say look there is a new york city therefore he was able to shoot webs from his hands
and fly from building to building well no there is no therefore if you're trying to if you're
trying to argue from that it's a disconfirming thing it's something that you wouldn't even want to
bring up I wouldn't think because your opposition is going to be the one that is saying all right
look your your holy book whatever says that this place was in existence and that place was in
existence this is why in the conquest account we talk about things like Jericho or I or any of these
other Canaanite cities because they're disconfirming of the story right as it stands in its canonical
form so if Jericho is not there that's bad if it is there it's not that it's good for the
narrative of the Bible it's just it's like and just because Khotsoar is there and it looks like
it has a destruction layer that could fit with you know the period of the conquest that's not
confirming it's just not disconfirming so it's you know I heard the same thing and we'll wrap
this up with a historicism a lot of historicists who are arguing on the Jesus stuff which still
can be used in arguments like you're talking about these patriarchs and whatnot and they'll say
really historicism has a better chance at being true period no matter how you wrap it up because
if there is some and this doesn't prove historicism this is just the point like
James the brother of the Lord okay you you have to either make that mean a brother in
Christ in some sense or something like that but if it means an actual biological brother
he existed doesn't like you said it doesn't add all other stuff doesn't make the myth true
sure but there's so many ways in which even if one of these things is accurate it does give
it very similitude to history but yeah there's there's so much stuff to to consider about this
and I really enjoy it I like looking at it and I think what we do too often is we're approaching
an ancient text with this analytical either or mindset not realizing myth sometimes is written
historically yeah of course yeah and I mean if the argument where there's no ancient Israel
well the moment you have the merneptas still it says 12 you know in 1207 here I've
Israel's seed is no more oh well there's an Israel right so in that sense it works but nobody's
arguing I mean there's there are there are many people that are arguing that there's no Israel
right it's that it's that the text as it stands and the supernatural the canonical form and the
stories that are in it probably don't reflect reality as they as they were right there they've
been at a minimum greatly embellished and that there's probably some historical reality behind
it so then going to Pithom and Ramses and you know trying to trying to show that here the path
out of the wilderness could work and I mean great it's not disconfirming I mean it's just not
disconfirming whereas if you say Jericho didn't exist in in this size as a city or I was destroyed
in the third millennium and there was nothing there during the period of conquest whatever you
wanted in the late second millennium that is disconfirming that story as it stands didn't happen
that way so thank you
so
