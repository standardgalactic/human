a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen once again another patron John super excited thank you for being
a supporter John and everyone else if I haven't mentioned this in the intro thank you for
being a patron John asks hi Derek hope things are well with you I have really been enjoying
all of the posts of your recent trips especially the clip with Dr. Bowen about slavery question
about the book of Daniel have you ever heard of any documented Babylonian evidence that
Nebuchadnezzar had a seven-year hiatus from ruling then resumed as described in Daniel
no thank you for asking well done great video thank you so much obviously you know where
this is coming from yeah so for for people that that may not you know the background
of that question so of course in the book of Daniel you have Nebuchadnezzar sort of set
up in the story as this guy who this king who goes out and boasts about all the great
things that he's done and so God essentially strikes him down with this curse where he's
going to go out and eat grass like an ox and you know become like an animal essentially
for seven years and the way that the text when that the text talks about it it's it's
Nebuchadnezzar in the first person is saying like in this proclamation to all the nations
around I was arrogant and I did this and the most high God struck me and I became a wild
man blah blah blah but now I came I repented and you know praise the the most high of heaven
paraphrasing but yeah now my sense returned to me and all this stuff
so I do have any evidence for that happening in Nebuchadnezzar now and we like we don't have
all the you know detailed records that we would like for the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
during the Neobabalonian Empire but we know a lot
and what's more than that is this is why even apologists or not apologists but even
evangelicals that hold to an early date for the book of Daniel will say that the evidence
is with a second century date is what I'm getting ready to say so you know coming to that and trying
to find something in Nebuchadnezzar's rule something in his reign that matches some sort
of a seven-year hiatus where he goes crazy is misguided and the reason that it's misguided
is we know who that text is actually about so if you go to the Dead Sea Scrolls you'll see this
text called The Prayer of Nabonitis and Nabonitis to sort of set if you haven't read
through my book the section on the history of the Ancient Near East the Neobabalonian Empire
starts under Nabopalassar and he's the one that brings down the Neocerean Empire
in 612 610 then in 605 he dies in Nebuchadnezzar races back home from a military campaign after
the battle of Kharkimish and takes the throne so Nebuchadnezzar is Nebuchadnezzar the second is
this major Neobabalonian king and he's very well known for you know building projects and for
he's just very famous in the ancient world for the Neobabalonian Empire well after him you have
some other Neobabalonian kings including Leitnera Glisser, El Marduk, and then you have Nabonitis
and Nabonitis is a king that does just some weird ass shit I mean there's just another way for me to
say it even for like his time it was weird and what he does is when he comes to the throne I think
he rules for it I haven't looked at this one a little bit but he rules for like three years and
then he leaves and leaves Babylonia and he goes to stay in the west in Taman this oasis
and he's there for about 10 years till his 13th reignal year and he leaves his son
who shows up in the Hebrew Bible as Belchazar in charge of Babylonia essentially as a co-regent
so this isn't guesswork it's not that we sort of know about it or we you know we have a lot of
inscriptions a lot of documentation including like administrative texts that talk about this sort of
thing so we know Paul Alayne Boya went through in his book on Nabonitis talking about all the
different like laying out the chronology of Nabonitis reign so we know a lot about his reign
and we know about this 10-year hiatus and we know that it was seen as a little crazy because a
couple things that you know sort of stand out about it is Marduk is the main deity of Babylonia
at this point right he's uh he's the one that's worshiped as the main the main god the national
deity and because of that worship of another deity particularly above him would have been
really weird from a for the king in particular
one of the things that so so what he does and again Boya sort of walks through this
in the in the textual evidence is he sorry I it's for those that have my three-year-old has just
decided to come downstairs and hang out with us when he should be sleeping
but we see that he starts to promote the moon god scene and in doing so it really
pisses off the Marduk priesthood and when he leaves to go to Tehmer and I'm going somewhere
with this in case the audience is sitting there listening like why are you droning on about the
new Babylon I think it's valuable what you're talking about here okay please so when he's out
for the 10 years and he leaves his his son as co-regent um the king is required to participate
in this annual this new year's festival and the new year's festival is centered on Marduk
being like reaffirmed as the supreme deity and so that text that we always talk about the Anuma
Elish is this text about the ascendancy of Marduk over the other gods it's recited at this new
year's festival so again you can see how it's all about Marduk and the king needs to participate
well from a ritual standpoint if the king's not there guess what you can't have
can't have the new year's festival because he's got to participate in it so you're talking about
10 years where they can't celebrate the new year's festival and the Marduk priesthood is pissed off
about this so the the Hebrew Bible presents Belchazar as the son of Nebuchadnezzar he's not
the son of Nebuchadnezzar he's the son of Navinaitis and they place him as king over Babylonia he's
not king he's co-regent and the most important aspects the most important um I'm blanking on
the word here but the the things that the king does uh that are that are for him to do why can't
I think of that word probably because my three-year-old is sitting across meeting an apple and you're
doing a very good job keeping him quiet by the way um his uh is that uh prerogatives that's the
word that I'm trying to think of the prerogatives the king Navinaitis maintains them for himself
and so he's okay so this this tradition this memory of Navinaitis not only leaving for 10 years
and going off you know to to this oasis of Tama but also doing these crazy things
um these crazy things uh like um worshiping sin above Marduk was like again it's just seen as
sort of crazy and it's a madness that's sort of attributed to him right so in this prayer of
Navinaitis text sort of circling back this prayer of Navinaitis text um it's Navinaitis who falls ill
and kind of has this this this period of uh instability and the language that you see in the
prayer of Navinaitis actually is parallel very quite parallel specifically parallel uh to what we
see in the story about uh Nebuchadnezzar that's tributed in Nebuchadnezzar so the long story
short what's happened is that there was a the tradition about Nebuchadnezzar I mean about
Navinaitis and his you know time spent in Tama away acting all weird that tradition is maintained
in the tradition of the Dead Sea Scrolls you see it there it it it it it connects but in the biblical
text as uh in the book of Daniel as often happens in Daniel there's another tradition that's followed
and that tradition attributes it to Nebuchadnezzar now Chunliong Seow in his commentary on Daniel
has I think a really good um observation that may actually be the one of the reasons that it gets
attributed there uh to Nebuchadnezzar instead of to Navinaitis is that there's a connection that
seems to be made between Nebuchadnezzar who took the the vessels from the temple when he
conquered in 586 uh that you know those sacred vessels that were in the temple and brought them
to Babylon um Belchazar is the one who in the story profanes them by utilizing them so the
connection seems to be made between those two in that way but this is why I mean the most simple
and straightforward understanding of why Nebuchadnezzar would be called the father of Belchazar as
opposed to Navinaitis and we know this is father is not because there's some you know use here in
Semitic of father me and grandfather and son me and grandson or whatever and then we have to postulate
that uh you know Navinaitis married a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar like Neragliser did but I just
leave all that aside it's that Daniel attributes what is a tradition about Nebuchadnezzar that the
memory about Navinaitis to Nebuchadnezzar which explains why he would call him his father because
it's it's attributing these characteristics of kind of going crazy leaving being you're being
gone for this period of time to Nebuchadnezzar when it it's clearly about Navinaitis and another
thing you mentioned in your book hint hint get the book can you show that book real quick if you
don't mind I always love that that cover too for anyone who's interested that is a must-get
book right there um in your book here right no but in the book you mentioned something interesting
the other scholars are pointed out as well within the prayer if i'm not mistaken it's this particular
prayer um what happens is uh it seems like it sounds almost hebraic in a way too so like
there would be no real Nebuchadnezzar saying a prayer like that yeah and there's there's so many
things in it you know I kind of do go go through them in the in the book and there's so many things
that don't make sense about Nebuchadnezzar saying what he's saying for example uh if you read through
what tremper tremper longman says about this again he's an evangelical that holds to an early date
um you know the first question that comes up is why don't we have any evidence
about a seven-year hiatus uh why don't we have any evidence about him turning to uh you know the
god of israel why don't we have any evidence of that and tremper longman's response is well
twofold one we don't have all the documentation that we would like from the neobabaloonian period
and from the time of nebuchadnezzar and that's true we have a lot though um and secondly this
might be something that would be seen like as an embarrassment to him so he might not want
it to go out the problem is that the text is it's all about a proclamation to all the people groups
that are under his under his rule and you would have to assume that this proclamation went out
without any trail at all and that immediately he changes his mind and says nope I I no longer worship
the god of israel which I think would be completely counter to the whole point of the story in the
book of daniel and that is that a king who is antagonistic against the god of heaven
undergo and is so haughty undergoes this great transformation because god can change the heart
of anyone and it would have to be the most ephemeral change because it happens and it
immediately changes so it leaves no evidence and this seems to be completely contrary to the
point of the story in the book of daniel awesome and so finally if we will I would like to have
oliver uh who is your son and you are his father to to go ahead and get on camera oliver so
everybody can meet the real son don't worry uh they can only see from here up so um there is
the man with the plan right here can you can you say tang gang can you say it without the apple in
your mouth tangy that's like yeah and puts it right back in the um yeah thank you dr josh i
appreciate it oliver thank you oliver for being a good boy the whole world sees it and you're
not famous thumbs up thumbs up yeah you're famous you're famous now even though the you're rubbing
on the mic it's okay no worries no worries but uh yeah there they are
um
