You have been found guilty by the elders of the town of uttering the name of our Lord and so as a bliss fever!
You are to be stoned to death!
Look, I had a lovely supper and all I said to my wife was that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah!
Yes for me! He said it again!
Dr. Delcey Allison Jr. I had a question from Dr. Dennis McDonald and before we recorded I wanted to read it because it was highly complex
and I'll be honest the material just it's not stuff you've looked into number one
as a scholar you respectfully declined to actually go into that without researching it and giving an opinion on it
so I respect that like I totally get it.
The question really boils down to and you write in your book that you think that there was a Mary who had an appearance
or something like a memory here of a Mary a woman which would be embarrassing criteria of embarrassment for a lot of people they would say
why doesn't Paul mention Mary why doesn't he mention Joseph of Arimathea and who's the other this is Joseph Judas and Mary
he doesn't mention any of the three and these would be like you would think big things now he doesn't think Judas existed
I think he doesn't think Joseph of Arimathea was probably a historical character or Mary maybe I don't know but
okay so I mean I suppose you could go through this piece by piece you could say why isn't Mary mentioned
and I gave a number of reasons in the book why she might not be mentioned even if this if there was an appearance to her
maybe those aren't sufficient I don't know as for Joseph of Arimathea I don't see any place in Paul
where Joseph of Arimathea would come up or where Joseph of Arimathea would be relevant it says Jesus is buried
but I don't know why you had mentioned Joseph of Arimathea also Pilate is not mentioned here and I think Pilate is an historical figure
but well he is an historical figure and I think Jesus was crucified under his order
but here's the thing you have to be careful with there's a tendency in scholarship to which is perfectly understandable
and is often defensible that you you line up your sources by date and you say that what's in the earliest is what was around
circulating then and then your next source well if there's stuff in this next source that isn't there that's because it arose
between the two sources right that's often true but I think it is simplistic and I think it's really simplistic
when it comes to Paul and the Jesus tradition because I would say for example that Jesus was an exorcist
I'm pretty confident of that but Paul nowhere says that Jesus was an exorcist Jesus was also a healer
I'm pretty sure and Paul has no place for that actually Paul has no miracle story of Jesus and doesn't refer to any
so does that mean should we infer from that that none of those stories were in circulation before then
I would prefer I prefer to think that Paul's letters are exceedingly occasional
and that lots of things that are missing from them were not missing from him
but were not relevant to the occasion of writing so for example take the Last Supper or the Lord Supper
Paul does quote a text very much like what you find in Mark and Luke and Matthew in 1 Corinthians
but he only cites it he only cites it because the Corinthians were screwing everything up
and he was unhappy with what they were doing if they had been doing a good job of the Last Supper
there is no trace zero trace no hint of a clue of the Lord Supper of the Last Supper anywhere in Paul right
so it does seem to me that Paul must have known a lot more than is in the letters
it's inconceivable to me that everything he knew about Jesus that every story he knew about Jesus
is in the epistles that just happened to be extant that makes no sense to me and here's the other thing
let's say that Paul let's say Paul is preaching somewhere he's just he's just showed up in some city in Greece
all right and he stands on the corner in the middle of the day and he says Jesus died for your sins
and God raised him from the dead okay fine what is so most people are just gonna say forget that right
but what if you stop and you listen to him and you think well okay seems like an interesting character
I'll listen some more what is your first question your first and only question is well who is Jesus
Jesus died for your sins and God raised him from the dead I know what theos is but who's this Jesus guy
the way to bring this home is to say that let's say Jesus of Nazareth was named Fred not Jesus
so Paul goes into this city he says Fred died for your sins and God raised him from the dead
the only question the only sensible question the only thing that makes any sense is who the hell is Fred
yeah who the hell is Fred and if your answer is well he's the guy who died for your sins and God raised him from the dead
you have a blank you just have a cipher you have a nothing and human beings don't want that
and that's not how you started religion you started religion with stories you bring people together with stories
Paul has to have stories I know he's got some Old Testament stories some Hebrew Bible stories
Jewish scripture stories how could he not have any stories about Jesus zero and be a successful evangelist
I have trouble understanding that idea but there are no stories about Jesus in his epistles
so he has to know more than his than is there and again I don't know why Joseph of Arimathea would show up in Paul
now what I'm saying here doesn't prove there was an historical Joseph of Arimathea or a Mary Magdalene
but if you think there was a Mary and if you think there was a Joseph it's not so incredible that they don't show up in Paul's writings
because I think there are lots of things in the gospels which were published after Paul's letters that were in circulation before Paul's letters
they're just not in Paul's letters Paul's letters are not a comprehensive statement of everything that was present in Christian tradition when Paul was writing
that I don't that doesn't compute
what about Judas just mentioning him is there something there
well so the the usual story is that Paul says Jesus appeared to the twelve and should be eleven if the story of Judas is true
the usual explanation you find is that the twelve had become a term whose meaning was more important than the number of people actually present on any occasion
that is it is the twelve right
not that it's literally twelve figures literally it's represented that
I think I think it's in the Greek dictionary and Bower aren't Gingrich and Danker
I think when they in the article on Dodeca on twelve they cite examples
and I don't know if it's there or somewhere else
but after the Athenian war they set up the thirty in Athens to rule Athens for a while
and there are places in the historians where not everyone's present and they're still called the thirty
so I would guess that's what's going on it's a symbolic meaning of the number and you don't want to be pedantic about it
but there were especially some of Bultmann's students in the 1950s and 1960s said well Paul refers to the twelve
which means that Jesus must appear to literally twelve which means Judas must have been there
which means his apostasy was actually post-Easter and then after he left the movement they decided to make it worse by having him deny Jesus in the pre-Easter period
so there was a Judas but his denial was post-Easter but they moved it to pre-Easter
I think that's fairly convoluted and I would prefer just to say Paul's working with a number rather than
and just like before the lack of evidence is an evidence of absence but it's technically you're not sure
it can be but yeah you just have to be careful
what do you think of Judas then I guess because it's an interesting question
I have no idea what to make of Judas you know people have spent a lot of time trying to discern his motives
and you know if there's an historical betrayal what was going on
I've never read anything that I thought oh that must be the case I've just never run across anything
so I have no idea what his psychology was or what he was up to, what he intended, whether he was disillusioned
whether he wanted to force Jesus' hand you have no clue
you do think there was a memory though
I think there is a memory but again it's written up so if you look carefully at how Judas is presented
he is modeled on a Hithafel who is a guy who betrays David right there
back in the former prophets and a Hithafel for example it goes out and hangs himself
Judas he went out and hanged himself the Greek is almost identical same verb
same verbs in that case and some of the texts that are cited with reference to Jesus
at the last supper are texts that are associated with the Hithafel and the betrayal of David
anyway there's a whole David typology I think going on in the passion narratives
and Judas plays the role of Hithafel who is the person who betrays him
but I don't think it's fiction again I think it's the language I think that they are remembering something
and then they're trying to fathom it and one of the ways they fathom it is through typology
is like Moses and Jesus is like David oh David had a betrayer right
you know I don't think anyone knows what happened to Jesus
I'm sorry to Judas you know there are different endings
Papias has him run over by a wagon Matthew says he hung himself
Axe sounds like I don't know he exploded in a field right
maybe he hung himself and they got run over by a wagon and exploded
so that would be your harmonization approach but you know my guess is that he just disappeared from the scene
and that they were left guessing as to what happened to him and what they knew was that it must have been something bad
it could have been good
Can I throw you one idea that I had that I thought was really interesting and get your take on it
I was looking at Judas and I saw he's betrayed for shekels of silver
and Judah in the narrative of Joseph is a clear brother of Joseph
who when Benjamin and the others are there and they say let's kill him
he says no let's not kill him let's sell him
and it was Judah that was the one of course if you look at the documentary hypothesis of course as well
so you've got like a mix of two different traditions here that are kind of finding a way in their contradicting
but in the tradition you do see Judah and he's like no no no let's just sell him
so there's the selling who was it the Ishmaelites or the whoever anyway
the point is you get into Egypt and here you have Joseph who is accused of raping Potiphar's wife
and he's in charge at the at the dungeon I'm kind of skipping stuff here to get to the point
he hears two men who have dreams he interprets the dreams and says in three days
the funny three-day motif that we find throughout Jose does it all the different books do it
but in three days you'll be if I could use the term resurrected to status back in Pharaoh's house
if I could use that term and the other one you're going to be resurrected to condemnation
your head's going up on a pike here and the birds are going to come and eat the flesh off your skin
and what I noticed was one was a baker and one was a wine bearer
and here you have a Eucharist kind of oh my now that so up till now things you have said
I can refer can remember yeah that's in the commentaries or some of the commentaries
or that's in the church fathers you know they go through and they see those sorts of parallels
but that one I don't think I've ever seen before
oh it gets even better because he says to him you know that to the baker you know
you're going to die in three days but in three days you're going to live and while he's leaving the dungeon
he literally says to Baker don't forget about me remember me
okay and sure enough he remembers him and when the moment strikes I love stories
like I'm in love I get goosebumps talking about it just because I love this stuff
and I relate to it so do you think there's something and then he's at the right hand
so so yeah there is some Joseph typology certainly in the Gospels
Joseph in Matthew one and two has dreams right and he goes down to Egypt
and people often think that's that's interesting there's also that parable of the
well parable of the the wise and wicked servant
and the wise servant is left in charge by his lord of his entire household
and to give the food to actually Luke says to give them the grain
you look at the linguistic things and again the commentary tradition they pick this up
the wise serpent that with a wise servant is like Joseph right like Joseph
so there are I mean people are Joseph is present in the tradition
where you took it just then with the coins and all the rest of it
that is something that I looked into at one time and I have no memory of what I concluded about how far this typology could plausibly be carried
I just I'd have to look and see what I thought when I worked on this ages ago
I haven't gone back and worked on that for 25 years
yeah I just thought it was interesting
but but it's also interesting what if a lot of those parallels are just happenstance
could be right well if they are that again tells you you can draw really intriguing parallels
one of the things I often thought of doing I'm never going to do it
but I thought of picking up some Buddhist texts
and you know running some parallels between Buddhist texts and the and the Gospels
on the assumption that there's probably very little influence one way or the other
and seeing what I could come up with I'll bet I could find some amazing things
oh you will startle people right and then what does it mean well
and it makes me personally makes me think there's a common
a common trope in human experience
oh there are lots of common tropes I mean you remember
oh what was this Joseph Campbell's book the hero with many faces
right right so yeah lots of these things appear over and over and over again
there's also but the baker and the baker's not all over the place
yeah that was a pretty cool I when I caught that my like it really did shock me when I was like
oh my gosh this is a pre you know it's kind of got the Lord's Supper
but it's really the passion narrative in a way of a typology that I thought was fascinating
but in the Buddhist texts one guy told me to ask this question
and I think Dr. Price has looked into some of this and Robert Price is actually a friend of mine that I know
and he said there's a scene where Buddha actually walks on water and like
yeah there is and it is possible through the old trade routes
that this story makes it to the west or to Palestine
and influences the the gospel story
Ulrich Lutz in his commentary takes this possibility very seriously
Wow
yeah so it's I mentioned it in my commentary and I think I just left it open
yeah this may be an old pre-christian story and it's a neat story
and it may have circulated and then somehow worked its way into Judaism
Thank you
No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle
Do you understand? Even if they do say Jehovah
Do you understand Jehovah?
you
