Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen I'm gonna try to ask this as succinctly as possible my patrons
have been trying to give me good criticisms about how to do this so how does archaeology
debunk if I could use the term or kind of cut through the biblical narrative so the
Bible versus archaeology take us through the problems yeah so I mean sort of and I
guess as I answer you can interject and developers steer me where you want me to go but big picture
here is and again I'm not an archaeologist I've got a fair amount of archaeological training
I've been an archaeological excavation but I think there are professional archaeologists so I
you know I want to be clear from the outset about that but the information that I'll give is sort
of consensus archaeological position okay there is this idea I think among Christian apologists
that if we can go to the Bible which the Old Testament for example that we are starting off
assuming that it's correct and that what it's presenting is historically reliable then if we
can go into different areas of investigation and find consistency with it that that that lends greater
and greater credibility to the thing that we already believe is historically reliable so when
you read something in the book of Daniel and it says Belchazar and you know a hundred years ago
scholars are like wouldn't anything about any Belchazar and then archaeology pulls up oh here's
Belchazar they're like aha see it proves the Bible right okay yeah it's not really how that works
because the the the goal of there there's no goal of archaeology when it comes to
proving or disproving the Bible that's not like biblical archaeologists they don't do that anymore
in my I've got a chapter in my book where I talk about sort of how biblical archaeology has evolved
as a discipline and before that was really the point of biblical archaeology it was to you know
either illuminate the biblical text or even in cases to defend it and so even as late as like
the 60s of people like William Albright either that he has this like basic idea that the historic
of the Hebrew Bible is historically reliable and so as we dig down into the ground it's going to
confirm illuminate and confirm the the historical reliability of the biblical text well we're not
there anymore and the short answer why or the short reason why is that as they dig up more sites
it becomes clear that the timeline the chronological you know layout of the narrative that the Bible
has doesn't match what we see coming up out of the ground so what is it that what is it that
archaeology does William Deaver I think makes a really good case for archaeological data being
primary evidence primary data in that it's not subjected or it's not subject to the biases that
for example propagandistic textural pieces are subjected to if I may just in what you're saying
someone who hears this that might be a Christian might automatically go see but that's see you're
already trying to do that against the Bible no what you're actually saying is not just biblical
you're talking Sumerian Akkadian like it doesn't matter what the context or what society archaeology
is going to go with what the facts are on the ground and the evidence there now sometimes
stuff might be missing sometimes of course there's limits to what you can do but text that are
propagandistic or potentially mythology or the genre may not be literal it might utilize people
places things etc etc like that you would be equally applying it to other cultures as well
absolutely and and this is like this is the real issue um let's let's take an example with
the third millennium there's this big conflict that we know about the umma-lagash border conflict
I talk about this in the book in the the history chapter and the documents that we have that tell
us about this border conflict between the city of umma and the city of lagash are from lagash
right and their their inscriptions that these royal inscriptions that are from the the vantage
point uh from the the position of the kings of lagash so what you would expect to see is what
we find so if you read through it's a bit to sort of very briefly lay this out there is this field
or this this grouping of fields that lie in between the city of umma and the city of lagash
in southern mesopotamia and they are under like they're in dispute between these like this is how
cities worked right you have people in the city and then the people that are in the hinterland
that are in the countryside uh that are providing food and other necessities uh from agricultural
products um and grazing areas for animal husbandry that's what so the step is really really important
to the city so it's going to as cities come closer and you have this sort of field in between them
you know Hatfield and McCoy sort of you know that's our no that's our land that's our land
that's our land and so if you're getting it from the perspective of lagash of course umma
has agreed that this is lagash's field and that they're renting it from lagash
and that they didn't pay the rent that they were supposed to pay and so that's why umma had to go
fight them for it i mean why lagash had to go fight them for it and lagash is perfectly justified
in doing that it's a mandate of the gods why they do it well if you got umas which we don't have
but if you got umas account they'd be saying this is umas field and lagash is renting it out from
uma and they trespass and that's why we had to go to war against them okay well the texts that were
getting are propagandistic right they're they're they're spun right fake news uh it's not that the
historical you know basic historical uh facts aren't you know uh reliable in general like is
there a border conflict yeah is there a battle between the yeah um but it's the specifics how it
plays out um why it plays out those are things that are spun and you we understand why and nobody
disputes that however when you come to the biblical text we don't often notice that spin because we
see this as a holy text okay so what archaeology does is archaeologists says okay let's look at
something like the exodus narrative or let's look at something like the conquest account
and you know when when biblical archaeologists 100 years ago were going out into you know
Palestine and digging down and finding cities like Jericho and I and Hatzor and you know
Megiddo and all these other cities that are important in the stories of the Hebrew Bible
they're digging down trying to like confirm and defend a hair look out see how it matches
up to what the bible says well as time went by and more data came in it was like uh I don't know
that doesn't really match up very well so for example the city of I is a great a great example
of this the city of I um which in Joshua 7 I think uh it undergoes this ambush and is destroyed
and it's supposed to be this you know great city and they initially you know fight off the
Israelites and but then they're ultimately defeated well like archaeologists go out there and they
dig down and they'll wait a minute there's not even a city here at the end of the second millennium
in fact there hasn't been a city here since it was destroyed in the middle of the third millennium
so they're taking ruins if you correct me if I'm wrong they're taking ruins and writing a narrative
as if they are the one like it's almost like if you and me came across something living in
america and we were up here near pennsylvania maryland we found a thousand-year-old uh stone
hedge use stone hedge okay I think that's great like any hellboy if you watch the hellboy right um
but like the hellboy too I just watched it a couple weeks ago you know it might not have been
stone hedge but it was something similar to that um or dr who uses it in the same way
like what do we think about stone hedge well there's got to be some alien aspect to it or there's
something that's otherworldly uh there's some sort of something that we don't know about that's
that's established this and so like that in hellboy that's where they're at they're up in the
scottish highlands or something and there's these big rocks that wasn't stone hedge but it was these
big rocks and they're trying to find this entrance uh to to find the golden army and that they blow
this whistle and this the rocks that are sort of spread out there become come up out of the ground
is this huge giant right okay so like stories build up around these major monuments these super
structures big ruins like that this is what happens right and and if you don't know the background
and you particularly if you're coming into intermittent contact with them as pastoral nomads
you're grazing your sheep and you're coming up on these ruins and you're looking at them in stories
or being spawned about what actually happened here legends can build up very easily about and and
this is what's important about kanan um you know if you look at throughout the early bronze and middle
bronze age ages you see that there's that these periods of great expansion monumental architecture
these huge buildings huge walls big fortifications and then you know famine hits or climate change
you know hits and people can't sustain life inside those city walls anymore and so they
become more you know they start to go out into pastoral nomadism which is you know you can
seasonally migrate and take your it's it's easier to survive that way um and so now these cities get
abandoned well now a couple hundred years go by these ruins are here they it's mud brick or you
know the stones start to kind of fall down or whatever and and you look at it people are
looking at this thing oh wow look at these giant walls these giant buildings um and stories start
to develop out of giants must have built these things right no our our ancestors actually destroyed
these people yes because our god was on our side that's right and so those things can be used to
develop whatever narrative it is that you're trying to develop so then the that's why when an
archaeologist goes and he digs a sounding right he digs down or he digs down in several places on
the site and you know she comes to the dating goes whoa like we don't we actually the occupation
layers that we see here there is no occupation in the late bronze age in the early iron age
like i don't i don't actually remember when i is repopulated but the time of the destruction
that's supposed to happen nothing right hadn't been anything for more than a thousand years
so then how do you engage with that sort of thing well archaeology like biblical archaeology has
moved it's shifted and so they're not you know if you look at um uh you go to like the oriental
institutes website and you see these lectures by biblical archaeologists um who are talking about
the origins of israel the formation of israel uh or you know the early centuries of israel
late bronze age early iron age they're not concerned about we have to disprove the bible
we have to prove the bible that's not even yours yeah it's not even on their mind it's all right
we have to we need to use the Hebrew bible as a source because why wouldn't we use it as a source
in the same way that we'd want to use royal inscriptions as a source but that doesn't mean that
you know you again i always use sargon's eighth campaign you use it as a source to say things
like all right well it seems like there was a battle against urartu well here he talks about
urartu being fought but that doesn't mean you then fill in the the gaps and say okay so the king
himself ran ahead of his army because his army was slowing him down and then you you know write
the history based on how amazingly fast and powerful sargon was now it's not how that works
and if the archaeology reveals that hey there was no destruction in the late bronze age and in the
early iron age at this site well then you have to rethink why is it that this this you know later
text is telling this story about this conquest and i think the the the failing of people that
are still trying to argue there's a book on the shelf i can't remember the guy that right
kennedy kennedy is his name um evangelical christian who's essentially i haven't read it
all the way through but just from what i looked at it seems like trying to you know salvage
the archaeological data and say well actually it can fit right um leave you know as joel
bayden would say like miss me with that shit right um like that's not what we're supposed
to be doing it's not what biblical archaeologists are supposed to be doing it's you you look at
sources of information for writing history for doing historiography and you say how can
like the rake and shovel method right you rake in the good stuff shovel out the bad stuff
you don't start with the premise that this is a holy text this is an inspired text and until proven
otherwise we assume that it's right i don't think that's the way to go if you want to start that way
like it is what it is i think that's how you know it's definitely how it was done it was assumed
that it was right um would you say hofmeier maybe yeah i mean i think like hofmeier does
tremendous work uh kenneth kitchen does tremendous work as egyptologists but then
when they come into these areas of of investigation i mean i think that the theological commitments
color uh that their research right and when i talk to other egyptologists about this
you know they'll say yeah hofmeier does great work or and i hate using people's names like
i think it's i think it's appropriate here because we'll be about the exodus but
you know they're brilliant scholars there's no question but when you get into these areas
where i think that they they have attention with their theological commitments and what they think
about this text and uh you know the archaeological historical data and they go like i think that they
the way they come at it is not the way that i would come at it and it's not the way that most
scholars come at it i think it's better that you get people like you said who are going to
approach it like they would any other royal inscription from some other you know i think
you're right because then you don't it doesn't allow out you're weighing in one side more than
the other you don't want to i don't think you want to approach any ancient text and say
we're going to think it's all wrong until we have archaeological or whatever you know textual
anything confirmation i mean uh you know things that that show it to be true i don't think that's
the right way to go about it right on the other hand i don't think you go all right we're going to
assume this is all true for the most part until we have evidence that disproves it i don't think
that's a good way to go there's this sort of happy medium where you say all right i'm going to use
uh like i come to this text and i say okay what genre is this text all right it seems like there's
some supernatural mythological legendary things that are in it and so maybe we start on that
with that premise okay there's probably it's probably okay to assume that there's some historical
reality behind it some kernel of historical reality behind it um but you know all right let's go
investigate we don't want to assume that all of it's right and then as you excavate these cities
and you go okay well sure shit seems like you know as as i always like quoting bill diva but he says
like i think 38 of the 40 sites uh that the conquest talks about don't fit the the archaeological
data they don't fit what the narrative has and so like two out of 48 that's that's not very good
um and one of them i think that did fit was like they saw that it had been burned yeah and it's
like yeah i mean how many places when you go to destroy get burnt or they might have yeah
yeah it's just like just because hot sore has this destruction layer that fits the timeline
and i think there's even some contention again it's not my field but i think there's even
some contention about that but assuming that it fits perfectly um all that is is it's not
disconfirming right that's the key and it like cities get burned all the time that's what i was
going to say so it doesn't require the Israelites exactly and it might have been a canaanite thing
that happened at the time that was carried over or yeah there's so many ways that you can look at it
yeah so to put it simply because we can go on and on i'm sure and this is a topic that i'd love to
get like dr william diva on one day yes that would be amazing he could do this so much better than
it's really cool though hearing you i like to get different scholars who talk about this even
though this isn't your particular will house you've done these things to some extent um i just
wanted to kind of like say if you had to pick which one for trying to understand the reality
archaeology or the bible yeah um it sounds like archaeology has way more tools within its will
house because it's not just pulling from the biblical source the archaeology isn't just archaeology
using the bible as well as using any other ancient near eastern source yeah to try and draw
what may or may not have happened yeah in reality yeah whereas if you look at the bible you're only
getting one propagandistic position yeah and um if you start as a christian you're not going to say
propagandistic you're going to think purely reality this is true history you'd go i've heard
christians like almost laugh when dr price would say well if the exit has happened it seems like
god sent his angels down with vacuum cleaners to clean up the mess yeah so there was no evidence
of it right um at least as described in the bible so you got to go are you going to believe that god
like hid the evidence or satan's trying to deceive everyone so he hides the evidence i mean how
silly do you have to get here is a quote that i use all the time and i think watch i won't be able
to find the book as i never can find the books um you always find the books what do you mean i
never it always takes me like 10 minutes there it is it's an old 1987 uh scripture meeting and
method but there's this this uh article in here by lester gravey and he has this amazing quote and
i i think it fits beautifully here and i just have to find it 133 because i think it i use it in my
book and i just i don't know it just sums up it just sums up so well he's talking about fundamentalists
it's a great article uh but he's talking about fundamentalists and
uh
sorry where is it
what page is that uh i'm trying to find where the quote is specifically
um because he sums it up there here it is okay in his conclusion it's on page 148 what i have
attempted to demonstrate here is not that one way of understanding the book of daniel is somehow the
right one so he's talking about aspects of the dating of the book of daniel on the contrary
scholarship is always pushing beyond today's status quo probing challenging applying new data and new
theory what i have been trying to show is that despite noises to the contrary fundamentalism
is incompatible with scholarship fundamentalism has already determined its conclusions it is
not seeking because it already knows the answer if it has good evidence on its side which supports
the bible it uses it if it has little data it twists and interprets what it has to support the bible
if it has no evidence it hypothesizes that such will eventually be found and of course no amount
of contrary evidence is sufficient fundamentalism can never conclude that the bible is wrong
wow well said thank you dr josh of course
so
