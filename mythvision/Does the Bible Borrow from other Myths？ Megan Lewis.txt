ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Megan Lewis quick question it's it's a pretty powerful one inner textuality many
people who are Christian apologists you know they're trying to defend the Bible and then
get it they're trying to be noble and they think that their approach is correct the Bible
would never borrow from other stories if anything the stories are older but we're not even making
the argument of what's older it's pretty common sense that the mess of itamian come it's a
far older tradition but is the Bible borrowing from some of these traditions and I guess it
might be safe for you to take us somewhere in this sure so I think before we get specifically
into the Bible because there's a there's like a lot of background to this that I think is
very important when you're looking at that particular question in sexuality is when you
take a story or a motif or a theme from one location and then you adapt it and reuse it
sometimes to say something else sometimes to just tell your audience that you're aware of this
other tradition and kind of touch on it people feel clever when they notice themes that are
common across across different areas so my favorite example is the the book Emma by Jane
Austin which is a great book very much enjoyed had to read it for high school loved it there's a
movie if you're not keen on on reading books great movie but the book Emma is taken by the movie
clueless also great movie hilarious but they take the basic plot and they rework it for like a
1990s audience so instead of being like Regency England it's LA in the 90s and it's wonderful but
they take the basic plot and the themes and don't copy it slavishly like you can watch it and have
no knowledge of Emma and still enjoy the the movie but they like they rework it for a modern
audience essentially it's not plagiarism because they're not just taking what Jane Austin wrote
and claiming it was their own they're using Jane Austin's Emma as source material to elaborate on
and to expand upon so you see something very very similar really throughout the engineers
throughout the literary tradition taking themes taking topics taking like whole stories in some
instances and reworking them to fit in your own time and context to say what you wanted to say so
a great example of this is the Anzu myth which is about a bird a divine bird called the Anzu bird
which is like the storm cloud and he steals something called the tablet of destinies which
is like the infinity gauntlet from the Marvel movies it lets him essentially rewrite reality by
speaking so he steals it and the gods are very upset because he's not allowed to have it it's
there's and they send out this young warrior deity in order to try and get it back and he fights
Anzu and is repelled because as soon as he loses an arrow from his bow any time it gets any winner
Anzu Anzu just tells it to to go away and it goes away because he can rewrite reality so what
Anurta does is he cuts off Anzu's feathers and then fires an arrow and the arrow is obviously
fledged with feathers so Anzu calls his own feathers back to him inadvertently calling the
arrow to himself as well which strikes him and and he loses the battle and then in order to
cuts the feathers and throws them in the breeze which takes it takes feathers back to his family
of gods and they know that he's been successful so very basic very quick overview of that myth
fast forward a few hundred years to the Enuma Eilish which is an Akkadian epic
old Babylonian written to glorify the city god of Babylon Marduk and it tells of how he defeats
the sea monster Tiamat if you play Dungeons and Dragons she's in there she's not a dragon in the
Mesopotamian myth she's like essentially the personification of the ocean but she ends up
getting very very angry with the gods and trying to kill them all because they killed her husband
and Marduk is sent out to defeat her and he succeeds and uses her body to make the world
essentially and then he's like glorified by the gods and is hailed as king so that it's a great
story it kind of gives an etiology of the whole world but also explains why Marduk is king of
the gods in that particular time period what the Enuma Eilish does is it takes the Anzu myth
and kind of extrapolates it says Ninota is not the hero Marduk is the hero Marduk isn't even going
up against the Anzu bird who is like a threat but he's not like that much of a threat Marduk is
going up against Tiamat who is like this big primeval deity and she is massively powerful
and Marduk is so fantastic that he doesn't even have to try as hard as Ninota does he just defeats
her but there are a couple of things that Marduk does that kind of key the reader into the fact
that the the composer is drawing heavily from the Anzu myth and I think the most obvious one
of that is Marduk after he kills Tiamat he throws some of her blood up in the wind and the wind
takes it back to his family and they know that that he's been successful and that doesn't quite
fit because blood generally doesn't carry well on the wind in the way that feathers do so you
can look at that and you can say okay that's a deliberate borrowing from the earlier myth it
it doesn't quite fit it's a little bit like disconnected and that allows you to like say
there's a connection there so that's a super quick example of of intertextuality and Mesopotamia
but this kind of thing is really really common it's not considered plagiarism the ancient Mesopotamians
didn't have the concept of authorship and like ownership of creative like products of creativity
the same way that we do so it it wouldn't have been seen as essentially art theft I think one of
the things you often run into in in modern times of when you talk about the bible and it's it's
Mesopotamian context and Mesopotamian relationship is that people will say oh it's plagiarized
it's not plagiarized no one is taking Mesopotamian stories and saying oh this isn't Mesopotamian
this is Israelites I mean Christian apologists might but the the ancient Israelites wouldn't
have been doing that they would have been using original source material and expanding it reworking
it to fit their own framework and to say something very specific and one of my favorite examples of
that I think is the flood narrative and the flood narrative that we normally look back to is in the
Gilgamesh epic again it's an Akkadian text but contained within the Gilgamesh epic is a a retelling
of the Mesopotamian flood narrative which is much older than Gilgamesh it goes back several
several hundred years so what happens is yes honey
did daddy tell you he needs help or do you think he needs help
okay wait it's okay I'm nearly done all right sorry it's okay
um so if you look at the the flood myth in Gilgamesh what happens is humanity is is really
noisy and the gods can't sleep which is a big problem because they like their sleep so the
response a very measured and reasonable response is to send a flood to wipe out humanity um and
then they can get some sleep fantastic um one of the gods decides he's not so cool with this
saves his favorite human who builds a big ship takes some animals floats on the water and then
sends in succession three birds out after a number of days to ascertain whether the flood water has
receded yet um that's the real kicker yeah the three birds thing it's it's very specific and they're
not the same three birds as you see in Genesis but it is three birds um and like that's specific
enough that I think you can you can say oh well the person who wrote Genesis was aware
of the Mesopotamian flood narrative um but what happens ultimately in the Mesopotamian version
is that um the the guy Utnapishtim he lands he gives an offering and thanks to the gods
who had previously been lamenting that they just destroyed the whole of humanity because then
they had no one to give them offerings and they quite like offerings um so then they're all very
excited that someone has survived so Mesopotamia god's trying to wipe out humanity because humanity
is is too noisy it's kind of capricious it's not terribly reasonable I don't think um
so very sad and then you look at the version in Genesis it's saying something different
it's using the same basic story but it is saying something very different and what it's saying is
that um Yahweh had no choice ultimately it's not reasonable to wipe out an entire like species
because they're a bit noisy if humanity in Genesis is so wicked that Yahweh he couldn't do anything
else he'd tried and we kept failing and failing and failing and we're just so evil that there
was nothing else he could do he had to kill everyone so it makes the god look better yeah
he's not only as powerful as the Mesopotamian deities but he's more like there's a plan there
he's more just and more merciful and not as like arbitrary really um so it's it's the same basic
story and we can I think safely say that there is a point of contact there with the three birds
with the giant ship um but it's for a different reason something that always like made me really
red flag too is that god repents in the bible he's he's like upset as well as to why did I
all right let me make a promise that I won't do this again no matter how wicked you get yeah and
it's like you know what's crazy about this and later this is so outside of the what we're dealing
with here but just later on how he's like I'm going to destroy the world by fire this time
you guys I can't deal with it but the interesting thing about that is that the Mesopotamian deities
don't want to destroy humanity again because they feel like they have personally lost something
sorry they feel they've personally lost something they don't have anyone worshiping them anymore and
that's a loss for them Yahweh is just kind of okay guys look you fucked up but I still love you
we can still make this work yeah it's it's not a selfish act right right or at least a painting
it that way and you're right yeah you're interesting yeah well thank you you're welcome
so
