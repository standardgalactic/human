Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen this is a hot topic abortion okay and so many Christians and mostly
Christians will use the Bible to say the Bible's pro-life I mean haven't you read he numbered
the hairs on the head of one of the prophets not realizing not everyone's hairs on their
head are numbered by the way so when you look at the context not everybody's as special
as other people especially when you get into slavery stuff we talk about the Bible but
um the the argument is oh for pro-lifers right they say that the fetus is not a just a fetus
it's a it's a living being in your in your womb and you're killing the life of a baby
the Bible's pro-life I'm a Christian I have the Bible on my side boo yah you guys get
over get away from playing parenthood blah blah blah okay does the Bible really condemn
it hmm or how can you take us to what the Bible has to say about abortion so a great
book to read on this there's a there's a chapter in John Collins recent book what are biblical
values he has a chapter on abortion I think I think 99% sure 97.3% sure um I should look
at those things before I say that but my memory is telling me it's there so the the question
is uh like does the Bible specifically speak to the topic of abortion I don't know that
it does however um if we are coming to the text like many Christian apologists are and
like fundamentalists do and saying that this is the inspired and the word of God in the
way that it presents the text this is like historical reality those sorts of things um
then it has strong implications for the discussion for the topic I think so the two passages
that I think about with this and I'm going to have a whole maybe not a whole chapter
but a section of a chapter dedicated to this in volume two of my atheist handbook to the
Old Testament but there are two passages that come up a lot one primarily and that's numbers
chapter five so numbers chapter five is the test for the unfaithful wife and probably everybody
listening knows what where I'm going and what this is about but essentially you have a woman
who's had sex the the the charges that she's had sexual relations with a guy and the way
the text describes it is there's been ejaculation right and then that's important to this so
this is what the husband suspects he has this feeling of jealousy he thinks that his his
wife has had the sexual encounter where there's been ejaculation and just so that everybody
understands this it wasn't I you know I don't think that the problem was so much that oh
I'm you know I'm offended that my wife has been with somebody else although that's clearly
there but it's that this is a this is a crime against the husband if this is taking place
laws about inheritance and ensuring that you know there's purity in the line all those
types of things play in this very patriarchal society right so what do you do what do you
do if you're a husband during this patriarchal society where you suspect your wife has committed
this crime against you and yet you don't have any evidence of it and the legal rationale
you have these sorts of tests that you can do to try to get at the truth right so for
example getting into a slightly different arena if you had find somebody that's murdered
and in the book of Deuteronomy and I guess Deuteronomy 22 I can't remember but you have
like a person that's found dead and they're near a city but they're not in the city well
the elders of that city are supposed to come out swear an oath that they didn't have anything
to do with it and they sacrifice the like the heifer and anyway there's a whole ritual
involved with it where they say we're not guilty and then they're cleared of those charges
or cleared of responsibility for it so but again it's calling on the God as judge this
is the key like God is the one that he sees if there are no witnesses still God sees and
so they're swearing an oath saying we swear that we didn't do this understanding that
if we did we're bringing down the wrath of the deity upon us and we have rituals like
this in the ancient Near East so there's the river ordeal so if you there was a city called
hit that was on the Euphrates River and it was sort of famous for this the river ordeal
and if somebody had committed it suspected of committing a crime or there's a dispute
and we don't have a witness we don't have evidence you could do the river ordeal where
the person gets thrown into the river and if they drowned or if they you know the God
the river is the God and so the river is essentially knows all has the somnitions in this regard
and so would judge the person if they lied or you know clear them if they were telling
the truth but again it's this ritual that's done that's putting it in the hands of the
God to judge because we don't have evidence we don't have human testimony we don't have
eyewitness accounts so and so forth okay but all that is the background numbers chapter
five is a scenario where we've got this woman she's suspected of her husband of having sexual
relations with somebody else and what do you do well you bring her to the priest at the
tabernacle and the priest has a ritual and it's in a very elaborate ritual in numbers
chapter five by the way I promise I'm going somewhere with this everybody at home listening
I know it seems like a very roundabout way getting there promise I'm getting there and the
priest makes her swear essentially she's doing the same thing that she's swearing that she
didn't have sexual relations with anyone she didn't cheat on her husband and the priest takes
dirt from the floor of the tabernacle mixes it with water and then you know says this ritualistic
formula and then gives it to the woman and the woman swears before God that she did not have
sexual relations and she drinks it well this concoction God uses it and she goes home if
her and the text is a little weird here it's hard to really get at the specifics of it but
essentially her reproductive capacity her reproductive organs if she has lied God uses
that potion with the dirt from the floor of the tabernacle to essentially screw up her
reproductive organs and make her sterile she can't have babies anymore and if she is not lying
then God just lets that potion pass through her and everything's good to go and she actually is
you know fertile and she can have babies okay what does this have to do with the abortion question
well you know most scholars would come to this passage and say okay we don't think that this
thing was actually done we don't think this is an actual ritual is a later text you know this is
previously writing and so this this is something later it's maybe the way they thought it should
have been something they came up with whatever but this isn't an actual you know something that
was taking that took place however if you're coming at this from a more fundamentalist or even a
Christian apologetics viewpoint you might defend this text and say no no no this is actually God
prescribed this this is what's supposed to happen and then the priests they actually did this well
if that's the case and priests actually did this and did this in response to women having sexual
relations with men well the chances are that maybe even more frequently than not there's a baby in
the womb right and if this potion screws up her reproductive organs well this is this aborts
this terminates the pregnancy which is abortion now is the text focused on the fetus no I don't
think so I think the text is focused on the reproductive capacity of the woman but I think
the fetus is sort of ancillary it's it's there but it's not the focus so I don't think it's a text
about abortion however if you carry it through if you interpret it through that lens and you
carry it to that logical conclusion well God isn't you know he's he's prescribing a ritual that causes
abortive it causes abortions causes pregnancies to become terminated so then you'd have to wrestle
with that how is God prescribing a ritual that brings about an abortive process so I think it does
play into the discussion here so I'll pause before I go into the other does that make sense yeah yeah
yeah that makes perfect sense okay I think it's what keeps coming to mind I guess in a moral sense
with using modern-day idea looking at the Bible is there's also places and didn't want to go there
you're gonna get into another example here I think in just a moment about babies in the in the womb
but where God tells kill every man woman and child yes he's so concerned about the baby in the womb
yet one thing I think is important and you can verify this or say yes or no on this is is the
author writing this is coming from a chosen side so like it's the you're reading the literature of
people who already think they're the ones cared about by God which to me indicates that these other
people out there that aren't Israelites according to their God and their prescripts if you will
they're they're not it's not as concerned as the God is not like concerned about the Canaanites as
much now don't get me wrong there seems to be a weird thing about when Molec comes on the scene
and they're burnt offering children to the God Molec is that because other nations are doing
practices that are horrendous or is it that Canaanites are really us in some sense and that we were
practicing their same rituals so we need to kill off these guys because hey some of us are
practicing what they're doing you see and so we need to we need to do that I don't know I'm not
sure yeah I'm just saying if someone so thinks they're concerned they're reading stuff like the
eyes the prophet Jeremiah I think it is or Isaiah where he knows every hair the number of the hair
under your head no one else is detailed biblically that God actually knows the number of hairs on
everyone's head like every single person that it seems like the chosen are specials he knows every
number on their head yeah so I guess there's like different tiers for like how important you are
when you're seeing this and Christians have applied themselves into the context and said we are
these people sure you know so anyway what's your other example yeah I think that's a I think that's
important and it's sort of probably is a good segue into this this second example which again
is not a text about abortion I don't think that's the point of the text but it has implications if
you come at it with this interpretive model right and that is Exodus 21 22 to 23 I think is where
it's at and it's the the laws about when two men if two men are fighting and they hit a pregnant
woman what happens they hit a pregnant woman and there's a miscarriage right and we see parallel
laws in other ancient Christian law collections and while the the grammar the vocabulary is actually
a little tricky there there's this word Ossohn in the Hebrew that word it's debated what it means
but the overall point stands for what we're talking about so if two men are fighting and they
accidentally hit a woman who's pregnant and she miscarries if there is so that's the like this is
the the the main this is the situation that's being set up in this casualistic law two men are
fighting hit a pregnant woman she miscarries boom okay what are the different circumstances well
if there is Ossohn whatever that means then there's a certain fine I think the fine haven't
looked at the passage and all I think the fine is whatever the husband sets as a payment there's
a payment to be made but if there if there's no Ossohn if there's no it seems like what the
passage is getting at is that if there is no other harm done to the woman then there's a fine
lost the baby right and that's a monetary thing has monetary value so then there's a fine that's
that's to be said but if there is it seems like if there is damage that's done to the wife that's
when it leads into then you were to give eye for eye you know tooth for tooth burn for burn
foot for foot you know whatever so what that then leads us to ask is wait a minute it doesn't
seem like there is lex talionis for the life of the fetus in other words it doesn't seem like okay
the person's killed so you got two men fighting fetus comes out there's a miscarriage fetus dies
well then whoever like there's death for somebody right there's why isn't the death of that infant
or that fetus why doesn't that death cause the person who caused the inflection to be put to death
or cause that person to really really pay a fine I mean no like five shekels or some crap that's
like yeah it's it seems like there is again I don't think this is the point of the text right
we're discreet we're discussing it because I think what it does is it shows that the value
there's a monetary value set on the fetus whereas if there's there's harm that comes to the woman
the mother then lex talionis applies right and you see this same sort of thing later in the passage
when it comes to a slave right so with a slave you know if you could the goring ox yeah I love
that example so the goring ox again same passage a little bit later on 28 to 32 I think versus
28 to 32 if there's an ox and he goers someone what do you do like this is the question it's not
a person killing another person it's an animal killing another person well there are a couple
of factors is this ox is this his first time doing it right is it is it that the ox just
it happened it because this is how life works right if people are in close contact with these big
animals and it could just be the ox was fine and all of a sudden he goers somebody right well then
you know certain set of lighter penalties here right however if that owner of the ox knows that
his ox he's been told before hey your ox has this tendency to gore people right it's a gore as the
text says and that the owner doesn't take steps to keep the ox penned up or you know away from people
and it takes safety steps to ensure the safety of people around the ox well then if it goers
man a free man a free woman or one of his children after it's already been after it's already been
established that it's a gore ox and he didn't take the precautions that then the owner's life
is forfeit so the people so the family members of the people who died have right to go kill him
that's right now the text then says however if a ransom is set right you can pay me for it right
so let's say just to put it in clear terms let's say you and I I have an ox and you know your wife
comes walking by your gore and the ox scores her and kills her and I've known that my ox has a
tendency to do that I could kill you you know have a right to my life or I could say for your life
instead of killing you I want 50 shekels and what would what would probably be more likely is that I
would go whoa okay okay okay okay okay look I'm really sorry what can I what will you take to
not kill me right and I would say I'll offer you 100 shekels of silver and you're like screw that
like that was my wife I really loved her okay okay okay 500 shekels and you go 500 shekels a lot of
money especially in that day yeah especially okay all right I tell you what I can't bring her back
yeah you give me 600 shekels and I'll let you live so that that that's what lex talionis I think
is probably set to do anyway but um that's that's however it let's let's keep it going
you have a slave okay and my ox gores your slave to death well you don't have a right to my life
right there's a 30 shekels I pay you 30 shekels and we're done that's it sorry that's oliver
apparently building something yeah oliver hey gotta be quiet buddy
shh shh shh okay um so the value of that slave is fixed right and it's not paid to the the slaves
family it's paid to you because you owned him or her and this is so so this is important to
understand that slave is that that is being treated under property law not under family law so coming
back to the two men fighting with pregnant woman gets hit and there's another there's a
miscarriage it seems like there's a monetary value that's being established like established
for the fetus because they're not quite viewing the fetus as a free man or free woman or already as
an established that's right it doesn't have the same value that another human has right that is
somebody that has been born is outside of the womb right um so all of those things together I think
those two passages again to be 100 clear I don't think that the text has in mind or that the writers
of the text or editors of the text had in mind we're gonna say something about abortion right
right I don't think that's what's going on indirectly though that's right it's something
that if you take this interpretive approach then you have to wrestle with why it is that the value
is different for the fetus or why it is that God's okay or is prescribing this ritual which
will bring about an abortive process because that would have been the perfect time to bring up
by the way you hit a pregnant woman of the man you're fighting you killed the baby and now it's
eye for an eye your life is now or or there's a way you can pay out if they're willing to come up
with a set price but no it doesn't seem like yeah the obviously the injury of the woman matters but
the child is secondary and it's so indirect on pointing out simply by that you can deduce
it's obvious that the importance of the life that's being aborted is not on the equal playing
field as a woman who gets harmed yeah so two different levels which means how does the bible
view infants in the womb in comparison well probably very much like we do in a weird way today
I mean obviously totally different context but you wouldn't look at a lot of women are viewing
this child this fetus is like okay it's not in the world yet it has not come and been born and
been birthed it has no recollection like we do and it won't suffer in the same manner that we may
suffer I don't know yeah I mean I think I think that let's put ourselves back in their shoes
you know mortality rates were incredibly high in the ancient world so there's no guarantee
that I mean Megan and I know very well you know we lost Harry last year right as like he was 37
weeks old wow and still you know died just as hard stopped I mean he would like she was having
contractions like he was in the process of being born right and his heart stopped so there even today
with all modern medic medicine and all the precautions but look we have no guarantee that
sorry no you're fine we have no guarantee that a child is going to be born right so
so much less did they have that guarantee um I mean we have ancient texts uh like the enuma
alish yeah the part part I mean not the enuma alish I'm sorry Atrahasis the the flood story
cating flood story um you know about the flood survivor Atrahasis like at the end it's demons
are set like there's this this whole process about this demon is going to go and snatch babies from
the birth stools right because this is sort of explaining why it is that so many babies die
which is like sids in a way yeah that's right um or even just in giving birth okay and so
like there is no from a legal standpoint let's say it's my wife and you know you and somebody
else are fighting and you hit my wife and uh the fetus that's you know 30 weeks or whatever comes out
well there was no like the the law has to say well there's no guarantee that that child was going to
survive and become uh active members yeah like a like a useful member of that household of that
family one that would be able to work and earn and all these things so we can't we can't just ascribe
to that fetus full value of a human that has made it through and survived and become a member of
full member of the household so we have to take that into account how do we do that right and and
that's why um I think the again the the rationale that people have the legal rationale that these
people have that are making these laws this is the the things that they're wrestling with and the
realities that they're wrestling with but again if you're coming to the text saying well the moment
of conception god views that as a full human yeah see and and and valued in the same way this is
what you have to wrestle with why is it that god would set out laws this way and not ascribe the
same sort of value ostensibly to a full human so the just wrapping this up um to put it simply no
matter where you stand on this moral argument on whether or not you think this is something you
don't like or wouldn't be okay with or you're okay with um the point is stop trying to use the
biblical account as your evidence to say this is proof that god is against abortion and he's
anti this whole thing i'm over here the anti this whole um you know people are going to this you
know getting aborted all the time if you will those children so they're killing lives and they're
murderers and this and this and that it's like you're using a text sorry this doesn't quite work
with you now you can go and cherry pick and pull out a context and he knows the numbers on your head
and it's like yeah who's he talking about anyway um my point is stop using the bible for that no
matter where you morally stand today on do you think abortions are okay or not um i think women
deserve to have the rights right i also think it would be foolish to just let personally uh women
as i've heard it said you know they fully carried and now they give birth to a board of child like
it's like okay shouldn't we have certain boundaries i i'm not a lawmaker either so this is above my
pay grade in an area that i'm not uh as well informed on all the nuances to different things
that can occur in reality rapist uh you name it the the the list can go on but um also health
conditions like what about a child that they know in the womb has something like this going to cause
the most horrific life on a child are we supposed to just well i believe in life and this child needs
to suffer as long as it can live for the eight years it has life while it's suffering and yeah
the parents go broke having to pay for medical expenses the whole time there's so many different
examples so quit using the bible i think is the point to try and justify your entire rationale
to go demonize people standing outside of these you know these centers where someone might be
really and you don't know their personal situation and you're out here using an ancient book irrelevant
of your modern context yeah i mean just sort of to to piggyback on that a little bit like i think that
so often what i see with people that are utilizing the bible to argue these
i don't know and i don't want to say crazy but these uh extreme pro-life positions
they are very frequently interpreting the bible as a fundamentalist would
mm-hmm and if you're going to do that to stay consistent you've got to take into account
these um these passages and to sort of last thing i'll say about this
you know i i don't like waiting into the abortion issue because for two reasons
number one uh i don't i don't know enough about it to be able to speak to it um
but probably more importantly is i'm not a woman and i think that women are so often
left out of this conversation and it frustrates the hell out of me because a bunch of guys sitting
around talking about what should be done with a woman's body just seems so bizarre to me
me you go carry a child for nine months you have your body i mean i have five kids now
and i've watched what what my wife has gone through i mean she carried harry for nine months
and lost him i don't think i have the right to tell a woman you have to carry that child
come hell or high water knowing that it's going to do all these things to your body
and you might lose it mm-hmm like i think that women need to have such a a much more
substantial say in this discussion because it's their bodies thank you
um
