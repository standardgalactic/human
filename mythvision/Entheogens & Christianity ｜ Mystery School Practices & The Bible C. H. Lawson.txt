We are MythVision.
Welcome back everybody, your host Eric Lambert.
We have a special guest today.
I first want to say go down in the description and be sure to show Luther some love.
Everybody's gone down there and helped us yet, so we're looking for help.
We appreciate anybody who's tuning in.
And we have a special guest with us today, Christopher Lawson, Reverend C.H. Lawson.
How you doing sir?
I'm doing very well, thank you yourself.
I'm doing great, doing great.
You look good, you look really good.
We're going to delve into some controversial topics here and I want to jump off and get
into our first question, but I do want to say you ended up having to go to court over
this and defend the cannabis sacrament for the Church of the Universe, I believe.
And you're actually going to present a lot of this information here, so you're going
to show us pretty much people using drugs in the ancient world, especially of course
in the Bible, but outside of that.
And this touches John M. Allegra's work.
It appears that your research kind of goes along those lines, even though it's not the
same.
Is there a way that someone could see this work and is it available so that people can
get it?
That PDF, if someone wants to contribute $25, send them that one.
I want people to actually pay for that one because there was a lot of work went into
that and frankly it's historic.
It's a case that was made by the rules of evidence in a court of law that stood up to
cross-examination by hostile opponents who did not agree with my views but could not tear
them down by the rules of evidence.
So basically what I'll be presenting today will only be the evidence that stood up to
cross-examination.
Ladies and gentlemen, you hear this, this is going to be a good show.
Be sure to tune in.
Watch all the way through because I know it's going to get more exciting as this thing develops
so he's going to take us through the Bible, other ancient stuff and these aren't just
drugs that we're going to be talking about but there's psychedelic drugs, there's marijuana,
there's a variety of different things here, opium, but they're being promoted in the Bible.
And I'm going to go ahead and turn this over to him, stay tuned.
So Mr. Lawson, take us into this because it seems like you took an approach of showing
first of all I'm not a fan of the war on drugs number one, I've never been a fan of
the war on drugs.
Do I think there's scenarios where the law needs to get involved?
Absolutely.
I mean meth houses, you know there's many reasons to say certain drugs are just not
okay.
Whereas there are other things that it's not like marijuana came on the scene in the 1930s
and then they start talking about oh you're going to rape your neighbor if you do marijuana
and all this anti-marijuana propaganda.
So you're actually taking a view that this has been an ancient custom and we could find
it in the Bible, other literature.
So take us wherever you will and I know this is going to be an enjoyable, fun trip here.
Fun trip.
Okay, people have been enjoying fun trips throughout all the ages from the time that
humanity realized they were self-aware creatures who could look at their universe and interact
with it.
Kids still today in the schoolyard spin around in circles till they get dizzy.
Other kids do the thing where they squeeze each other and take deep breaths until they
pass out and stuff.
We are always experimenting as part of our human nature to experiment in our consciousness
and expanding our consciousness in different ways.
People get a bottle of wine or they drink a beer, they're changing their conscious state.
Someone just even has a cigarette, they're changing their mood.
Somebody eats a meal with psychoactive substances, blowfish and things like that.
There are all kinds of ways that we change our consciousness and there is nothing innately
wrong or inappropriate about doing that.
And in fact, great philosophers have sought to change their consciousness.
The club de Hashishin in Paris in the 1800s, great literary writers like Claude Baudelaire,
Eufitz Ludlow, and Alexander de Maas and others were part of this club de Hashishin.
You would know Alexander de Maas for his writing the Count of Monte Cristo and the Three Musketeers.
These guys used to eat Hashish and then review each other's works.
But I'm getting way ahead of myself.
The Bible has anthogens in it.
We have things in the Bible that make us wonder where did these visions come from, everything
from Ezekiel's visions to Paul saying that he had experiences out of his body or he knew
people whether he was in his body or not when he knew them.
There's all these strange mystery things.
Ezekiel says that the Israelites imported Panag from the east and Dr. Raphael McCoolam
of Hebrew University has noted that P and D are often interchangeable as words are
transliterated from one language to another and so he suggests that the Panag in Ezekiel
was a reference to Banga or Bang from the east which was a cannabis-infused recreational drink.
So there are all kinds of indications in the Bible that tell us of a cultural norm that
is not part of our society today but was an accepted norm in their societies.
And the Hebrew Bible in Genesis 129 says, I've given you every green herb yielding
seed to you. It shall be for food or for meat and things like that.
Yeah, anyway, but the idea was that there was no disapproval of herbs.
So certain herbs like cannabis were approved and cannabis does show up in the anointing oil
formula. The anointing oil formula is found in Exodus chapter 30 verses 23 to 33 and it
clearly specifies that the anointing oil required nine pounds or 250 shekels of cannabis buds.
The Hebrew is kana bosum. Now the word kana in the Hebrew was derived from the
Indo-European word kana and that came from the Proto-Indo-European word canop and they
derived it from the Scythians. And we know about the Scythians from excavations of the
Poseric tomb in the Soviet steplands up in Siberia. And here we have desert conditions,
bone dry, and at the same time frozen. So perfect for preservation. We have one of their tents.
Herodotus described how the Scythians consumed cannabis and he said that they would get inside
a tent and they sealed the tent up and they would have cannabis burning on a brazier. A brazier is
a pot or a device, a container with three legs. So it would sit there and you could hold hot stones.
They would get stones on the campfire, get them as hot as they could, put them in the brazier and
take them into the tent and put cannabis buds on top. Herodotus said they would howl with laughter
and joy. So to be funny a little, you're saying the ancient hot box tent was what we do.
This was a religious sacrament for them and this nomadic tribe has a lot of parallels
to the Habiru as a nomadic group or what became the Hebrews or the Israelites and they
had a portable tent of meeting similar to the portable tent of meeting to the Scythians.
Moses was said to be in communion with God and you would know it because there would be cloud of
smoke at his tent. Moses apparently was alleged to have stayed with his father-in-law, Jethro,
the Midianite, the high priest of Midian. So whatever Jethro's religion was,
it wasn't enough to make a high priest of Midian say, you're not good enough to marry my daughter.
And we have suggested evidence that the Midianites used cannabis and the traditions
of a serpent on a pole in the Moses tradition is very, very similar to the Asclepius healing wands
which was a rough-hewn staff with a snake circled about it. We get the medical symbol with a
serpent on a pole from this imagery and the idea that Moses used cannabis is also suggested by the
fact that it was used to heal snake bites. A tribe called the Mephengu to this day still used
cannabis poultices to counteract the effects of poisonous snake bites. You make a poultice out
of the bud and it draws the poison out of the wound. So the idea that there was a healing of
snake bites there, that there's a serpent on a pole, this is all imagery of a stylized tree of
life. The tree of life is an image in many, many ancient cultures. The world tree, the Axis Moondi,
it comes in from many different directions and apparently this was part of the early religion
of Moses and it got carried on and approved. So cannabis became a norm in Hebrew society,
not worth mentioning, it was just normal. I was going to ask you pertaining to the tree of life.
I remember when I delved into research about the Amanita Muscarea Mushroom and I know John
and Imallegra has written on this and I've not read his book yet. I need to read it but I heard
it's heavy on etymology and a lot of stuff but there's a theory that that tree of life was
the Amanita Muscarea or at least the Amanita Muscarea was what grew under that tree. Now
how do you view that? How do you view the the Genesis tree? The Amanita Muscarea,
my scholastic friend Chris Bennett who's written many books on the antigens and I highly recommend
Chris Bennett's books. I have learned so much from Chris Bennett. I can't tell you how much I've
learned from him quite a bit and he suggests that the Amanita Muscarea might not have been used by
the Hebrew society. It might have been something else similar to it because he suspects that it
didn't grow in their area. On the other hand the Dead Sea Schools do talk about their teacher of
righteousness having a training period of 20 years and that the overseer of their camp had to
be a master of all the mysteries of men. So that implies a period where there was travel to other
mystery religions and a sharing and a syncretism of information. The Dead Sea Schools in general
are very anti- Gentile but they seem to think that the unique group of Gentiles referred to as
those who know or the cognoscentile. There's several places in the Dead Sea Schools that say
well they're the exception. God's approved them and when all the sect goes up to heaven and
meets in the throne room of God these guys will be there as an exception to the rule.
But they were handpicked by God. It's not our business to go and you know talk to the Gentiles.
God can do that if there happens to be some holy ones and the Bible does suggest there are
saints out there. Few righteous men prevent the destruction of the world so God assaulted a few
of them around the world. That interestingly enough that protection idea is used with James in
New Testament and is used of the Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Schools. The idea
that he is a pillar means he's supporting the community. The idea that he's the salt of the
earth. Salt would preserve the meat. They didn't have refrigeration so you had a slaughter. You had
to use up the meat in a hurry in a big feast or you preserved it by drying or preserved it by
salting. So salt was preserving the meat from going rotten and they applied this metaphor
to the saints in the world preserving the earth from going rotten. God doesn't think the world's
too rotten as long as there's enough of these salted people around preserving it. So the idea
that when James was slain in 62 CE that others were saying oh no we've lost our shield. We've lost
our pillar. We've lost our support. He's one of these one of these salty fellows that is keeping
everybody safe and when he's gone this brought on the destruction of Jerusalem. There was no longer
there were longer sufficient number of righteous people there and this is how people interpreted.
I'm not suggesting that I interpret it that way but this is how other people interpreted of James
and I'm going to read two paragraphs that you're not going to
gain everything from it right away because these are concentrated. So these will just be a guide
for what we are going to be speaking about in this video and maybe we have a follow-up video
because there's a lot of material. So I'm just going to quote from the preamble to my court
submission and these two paragraphs. Reverend Lawson's testimony includes archaeological evidence
that ties cannabis hemp to the origins of horsemanship. The Athanasievo, Andernovo, Bactrian,
Batay, Derivka, Kevalinsky, Kergen, Mikhojeva, Kemiob, Novo Danilovka, Okra Grabculture,
Persian, Samara, Scythian, Semitic, Southern Europe, Sredni Stog, and Yamnaya cultures.
A rapid even spread of Bronze Age quarterware pottery and metallurgy, proto-Indo-European and
Tokarian linguistic roots, 2700 year old mass cultivation of cannabis, and Caucasian mummies
in the Terran Basin of China buried with pounds of pot. A review of relevant sacred literature,
a Vestian literature with a sacred cannabis, a federal-based drink called Homa, Vedic literature
with its sacred cannabis-based drink called Soma, classical Greek literature with its sacred drink
Kokian that made scholars the admirers of the mysteries, Judeo-Christian literature with its
sacred cannabis-based anointing oil and hashish-based incense, the literature of the Dead Sea Scrolls
sect with its sacred entheogenic eucharistic meal, and the modern-day Church of the Universe with its
mission to get back to nature and the sacred cannabis tree of life sacrament of Moses and Jesus.
Now that's a summary of what I would be going through, so obviously one is not going to go
through all that like that, there's a lot of stuff. Now the other one in a nutshell, I put this in
my reconstructing Jesus book and I didn't want to deal with all the entheogenic details, and I just
wanted to throw in one paragraph, so I put, in a nutshell, the tree of life may be taken as a
reference to cannabis for multiple reasons. Its association with healing, Mark 6, James 5,
Numbers 21, Revelation 22, Asclepius, Shen Noon. Canaanite tree of life associations and commonalities,
incense traditions, deities, temple construction, rituals, cultic terminology, esoteric tree of life
traditions and theology, heavenly ascent, other cannabis-related deities, compared to the Israelite
Yahweh Elohim Kana Kana, with Midianite Yahu, Canaanite El, Egyptian Seeshot, East Indian Hindu
Shiva, etc. Guarded secrets versus revelation, tree of knowledge, the world tree, access Monday,
secret knowledge, agonosis, and initiation. Archaeological and historical tree of life
symbolism from Babylon to Paziric, parallelism to Scythian tree of life culture, can of meeting,
hemp using nomads, indoor cannabis incense, syncretism with Zoroastrian theology, pre-Zoroastrian
Homa and Soma, Zoroastrian Meng, the fiery cup, Damascus, that's Dome Coast, cup of blood,
Dome Blood Coast Cup, links to Syria, Qumran, Paul, the Eucharist, eschatology and dualism,
cannabis tree of life, cannabis serpent, cannabis wisdom, and cannabis insight associations,
the association with eternal life in the Avestan Homa and Vedic Soma traditions,
and its physical remains archaeologically, cannabis-related kergen culture gravewear,
cannabis incense from Bet Shemesh Israel, cannabis in quarterware pottery, cannabis in the Dashli,
gonardep and Togelup temples of the Bactria Margeana Archaeological Complex, Scythian cannabis
in Paziric, cultivated cannabis with mummies and yanghai tombs in China, butai cannabis,
horse bits, cannabis healing wands in China, cannabis-related and Homa-Soma-related word
clusters, cannabis etymology, linguistics, and historical references to it, Emperor Shengming's
guide to herbal medicine, the Egyptian Eber medical papyrus, Assyrian megal tablets, Galen.
For the interested reader, these details are given more elaboration in Bennett and McQueen 2001,
Bennett 2010, Lawson 2012, that's my court submission. Further discussion of cannabis must
be abridged as we continue, that's what I put in there for my reconstructing Jesus. Needless to say,
that is another long list and each of the items on that list have subcategories with their own lists.
There's an awful lot of material there, there is no way we can cover this in a week, let alone in
two videos. Good point. I would like to kind of, I guess what I want to say on this, because you
bring a lot up on cannabis and I know there's other drugs involved. We know there are other drugs,
it seems like we'll touch on those, but our central focus will be cannabis since it was the legal
the legal sacrament that for the Church of the Universe that you're actually arguing in court for
and that will be for our audience to recognize, but I want to say there's been two fields in my
research that they're trying to explain the early church Pauline what's going on kind of stuff and
so here's where I'm going with this, for any of you watching including where I'm trying to say
with this, in On the Historicity talking about Dr. Richard Carrier, Dr. Richard Carrier suggests
these people are probably schizophrenic, they're probably hallucinating and that is the explanation
and don't get me wrong, I know the brain already can do these things naturally without, well,
you know, on their own without a drug. I agree that that's possible, but I've always had the hunch
that these guys got together and said, let's go meet Yahweh, you know what I'm saying and
it's either drugs, I mean there's three possibilities, this is written and made up which is
the probability goes down in my opinion that it's all completely fictionalized, I think this is real
stuff that's being mentioned here, but them doing the things they're doing and having these
ecstatic things like Paul talking about going to the third heaven, speaking of things like you said
and I know you're going to go into this that are unlawful, you'll tell why, that sounds like there's
a lot in these prophets and in Paul that are drug related or else they are crazy and they really are
seeing things hallucinations naturally, but I suspect they're taking stuff, so do what you will
but I just want to comment, those are the two thoughts. Fair enough, well the use of entheogens,
the word entheogen was coined by Dr. Carl A.P. Ruck of Boston University, he's professor of classical
literature and he's also the author of textbooks on advanced Greek, so I had the privilege of
testifying about this information in court, Dr. Carl Ruck was also called to the same trial,
when the Church of the Universe trial occurred, there are actually several of them, the founders
of the Church of the Universe, Reverend Brother Michael Baldicero and Reverend Brother Walter
Tucker, I appeared in their trials in Hamilton courts and then the church members wanted me to
appear when they did a constitutional challenge in the Superior Court in Toronto and so I did that,
I put together my cannabis sacrament as a submission for that and Dr. Carl Ruck was called as an
expert witness for that as well, also Dr. Francis Henry who's a specialist on the use of cannabis
as an entheogen with the Rastafarian religion, then she was brought up here to Canada, she came up
from the Caribbean, we had Dr. David Bearman come up from California who is a specialist on cannabis
as an agent and helping other people kick hard drugs and he'd been using cannabis as an adjunct
therapy to help people kick opiates, ever since the 1960s down in California, so he was an expert
witness that came up, the defense team spent a hundred and twenty thousand dollars roughly just
done bringing in expert witnesses from around the world for this case, so I was in very good
company when I was in this court case and it was a pleasure to present the information and it was
actually a lot of fun just to enjoy a little moment of reminiscing here because when I was on the stand
they were very very eager to debunk me and they're just not exposed to the information like I am
so they really didn't have much of a chance and I didn't worry about it, I went to court to have fun
with them so I was on the stand from the very beginning of the day to the very end of the day
that was in April 21 2010 and the entire day I was on the stand and I just frustrated the heck out
of them, you can only talk about things on the stand that you put in your disclosure document
and I put a lot of vague generalizations in my disclosure document so it would allow me a
broader latitude to bring stuff up on the stand but because I expressed it in vague terms or
sometimes expressed it without scholastic support from the literature or the history just made a
claim he would obviously say well where do you get that word and and this is their weak spot
because you're not allowed to bring in information unless it's as part of an answer to cross-examination
so I left all these questions for them to answer and as soon as they questioned it I would bring
up a source that I couldn't include in my disclosure document because I put that together so hurriedly
yeah I'd bring up information so well to answer your question let me cite so and so
and all of a sudden I'm getting all these citations in their record and they were frustrated because
they'd never seen this information before they hadn't seen it in the disclosure document but
they asked so I'm entitled to give it and then the uh finally uh council said well you know disclosure
thing we don't see you citing sources and and doing the quotes and all that sort stuff and I
said well that was on advice of council not to put that in but since you want the sources for
everything and I had I brought up to the scan with me a copy of my cannabis sacrament the uh
I don't know if you can see that properly there you go anyway and I brought this with me of the
stand was sitting on my lap as I'm testifying so he said well where is all the evidence where's
all the sources where's your citations well we didn't know whether you really want to get that
technical and need all that but uh since you're asking for it here it is and I handed it not to
him to to the council but to the judge who and he the judge automatically reacted uh and she she
grabbed the the book and said enter this in his evidence you know uh number whatever and now all
of a sudden there's this whole mass material that's brought into evidence that the crown had no idea
about and no idea how to counter and they had no experts there to uh to debunk me they wanted to
have experts or they tried they invited Dead Sea School scholars from all over the place they invited
Catholics they invited Protestants they invited Jews uh everybody and nobody wanted to show
and testify under oath because this is controversial stuff we're talking about and they
didn't want to go on the record say no this is not in there and then I say well what about over here
or what about over here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and
piling it up what they're gonna all of a sudden the judge gonna say you know you lied to me under
oath you know you go to jail for that and no scroll scholar wanted to risk having their reputation
trash by a researcher who knows where to find the information in the scrolls didn't want that
you bring up something really really cool here and you delve into a lot of material make sure you
know I just wanted everybody to know to make sure that they get that it'll be in the description
or at least email me um if you pee if you pay pal me pay pal me you know uh the 25 bucks and write
a message and just say hey look I want to get this uh I want to see what doctor or I'll call
you doctor but c.h. Lawson I want to call you doctor no but uh c.h. Lawson um you know get your
material I spent 22 years in school so there are there are people with doctorate degrees who have
spent less time in school than I have so yeah I I definitely want to see um you delve into some
examples if you will let's go ahead and delve into some of these if you if you could for me okay uh
first of all um yeah it's a good good question where to start with okay uh I mentioned Dr. Carl
Ruck and uh I think we should start there because that's where the scholarly world first got
introduced to the concept of entheogen. Dr. Ruck created the word entheogen because he didn't want
to use the word psychedelic that would have been a natural word to use but it's already got so much
baggage attached to that word that he didn't want it to confuse issues or uh be disturbing that way
but entheogen the concept idea is that it causes you to think from contemplate the idea of God
or even to become God internally yourself uh within yourself uh this is a rule that
entheogens have played throughout history and we see it from Native American church
using ayahuasca and using mushrooms or peyote and these are all
recognized within their cultures as a norm and they're not doing it just to get high they're
doing it to have a healing process occur and an internal self-review so that beginning with Dr.
Ruck he first began his analysis of entheogens by looking at the Greek mystery schools and uh the
biggest of those mystery schools was in elusus and there they had rituals uh for for diameter and
Dionysus and people would go to this mystery and come away genuinely believing that they had seen
God they they they thought that they now had uh proof of another world beyond them and that
they they had now been granted immortality the idea was if you were to meet God then and live
through it then it means that God had granted you immortality so you don't have to worry when you
finally apparently die you're not really dead you're going to go to the same place that you
thought you were when you had this mystery initiation i love this i have to just say this
real quick because this is so good i love this material bringing up i was just asked on my other
channel because i do a recovery channel that literally is helping people who are pretty much
self-destructing from heroin and cocaine math you name it um and there's other people who may have
taken things too far you know that they just need help getting back on track and they asked me Derek
do you recommend people go to mexico for evo gain or to go and do a ayahuasca thing in south america
and i said look i don't recommend anything because i don't want to be there's so many lawsuits and
legal obligations here and i don't know because i heard evo gain can be uh people can die easily
from it because it's a strong potent it can happen but i have to be careful with that but i know that
the psychological experience that you get from that can really cause a permanent change or at
least a very long-term change in one's own psychosis so uh i think this is really interesting
where you're going with this so please keep going because it touches my other channel
yes well you may want for your other channel to consider talking to uh mark emory about the
use of ibogaine because he sponsored ibogaine uh therapy out in vancouver and he for those who
participated in the ibogaine i forgot how much it cost him or something like 20 grand per person
to get this kind of therapy done and mark footed the bill and he was having i believe it's something
like a 97 success rate now it's it was stunning yeah apparently ibogaine gets you so high that you
don't want to get high again that you you don't you don't want that you had enough of that that's
no more that for me i've had enough and it really it really hits people that way so uh it's uh
under controlled conditions where you've got a reliable safe supply and properly dosed and
properly managed and cared apparently this is an extraordinary therapy uh so this isn't a side
take that into account now uh intelligent people like mark emory have recognized the need
for these kinds of antigens has a healing process intelligent people such as the shamans from
different times past have seen the same thing and now getting back uh to dr rucks uh ideas
when he wrote roe dualusus he didn't author that book by himself
roe dualusus uh was written in conjunction with uh gordon wassen uh my colleges dr wassen
is a specialist in psychoactive mushrooms and and then uh the third author was dr albert hoffman
dr albert hoffman was the chemist who discovered lsd and so the three of them a mushroom expert
an lsd expert and a classical literature expert combined to write the road to elusis
suggesting that the entheogen used in the greek mysteries uh the greek mystery ritual involved
a drink called kikian and that the the active ingredient in the kikian was apparently a water
based extract from a fungus that grows on grains and grasses and the barley that goes around elusis
a fungus called ergot now ergot has psychotropic uh contents within it there are three different
psychotropic ingredients but two of them are deadly and they're oil soluble but the water
soluble one is the one that they were after and the active ingredient in it is lysergic
acid amide very much like lsd like lsd is lysergic acid diethyl amide and so this was lsa instead
of lsd but the chemicals have the exact same reaction on your brain so uh in about 2000 years
of plying this form of lysergic acid uh to the initiates there is no record of anybody
having a bad reaction or a bad trip so that's kind of now whether they covered that up as
we'll be in their best interest to do we don't know but there there are indications that if someone
has a psychoactive experience and something bad happens to them the ancient interpreted that as
being an unworthy person you were brought into the presence of god and oh oh you didn't qualify
so god slew you so that's how they interpreted the bad trips that this person was unholy so all
of a sudden now you have the concept if you want to have the best trip the best entheogenic experience
you have to be righteous you have to be holy and this fits where the dead sea skull people
were going with it the edit so this was the the highest pinnacle uh and they had initiation
experiences where they went up to the holy place the uh uh one q hodiyo from kumran talks about
the community and and the the council uh of the community that's their leader their leadership
group uh having gone up and ascended into heaven and spent time with god's own council and the
angels of the face so there's uh a lot of that uh dr rutt brought out how it was basically a form
of lsd that got the greeks their their experience of seeing god now saying what was the reaction of
intelligent people let's just take a moment and get the reaction of intelligent greeks to the mysteries
quoting cicero for among the many excellent and indeed divine institutions which your
Athens has brought forth and contributed to human life none in my opinion is better than those mysteries
for by their means we have been brought out of our barbarous and savage mode of life and educated
and refined to a state of civilization and as the rites are called initiations so in very truth
we have learned from them the beginnings of life and have gained the power not only to live happily
but also to die with a better hope now i'm going to come back to the idea we have learned from them
later learning from entheogens the new testament speaks about that too says your anointing has
taught us so very interesting you know so there are there's parallels about how they're using the
entheogens if Plato said it looks as if those who established rites of initiation for us were no
fools but that there is hidden meaning in their teaching when it says that whoever arrives uninitiated
in Hades will lie in mud but the purified and initiated when he arrives there will dwell with
gods for there are in truth as those who understand the mysteries say many who bear the one but few
who become baktoi these latter are in my own opinion no others than those who have given their
lives the true philosophy so Plato is saying the mysteries have inspired them uh they are uh they
give them a hope for the uh your future in Hades that you're not going to be lying in the mud like
those who weren't part of the mysteries but that one of the essential preparations according to
Plato was that uh those who give their lives to true philosophy you know serious students and uh it says
that they're uh they've got to be holy kind of people whereas again the saying uh purified he
calls him the purified go there so if you're not a pure person your mystery experience isn't going
to be as good but the pure people are going to have this wonderful hope uh putark said the soul
at the point of death has the same experience as those who are being initiated into the great
mystery at first one wanders and wherely hurries to and fro and journeys with suspicion through the
dark as one uninitiated so apparently the initiation began in the dark yeah then come all the tears
before the final initiation uh shuddering trembling sweating amazement then one is struck by a marvelous
light one is received into pure regions and meadows with voices and dances and the majesty of holy
sounds and shapes among these he who has fulfilled initiation wanders free and released and bearing
his crown joins in the divine communion and consorts with pure and holy men beholding those who live
here uninitiated an unclenched horde prodden underfoot of him and huddled together in mud and fog
abiding in their miseries through fear of death and mistrust of the blessings there so here here
the initiates look upon the uninitiated as an unclenched horde this is the same
minds from the deity scroll community if you're one of the outsiders you're not one of us and
initiated like us you're part of the unclenched horde it's a very similar pattern so these
people aren't just taking drugs to trip out this is this experience was sacred to them it was holy
to me if you don't mind me touching on something i'm sir i'm pretty certain it touches on this the
sacrament the sacrament so you know judge yourself okay before you do this sacrament you judge yourself
all right right now you can die if you do not judge yourself he says many have fallen asleep
because of this what is going on here chris what's going on yes paul is saying that the
early christian sacrament that he was familiar with was capable of killing you if used improperly
that's interesting the uh the so these things were meant for a holy purpose they weren't to
be used casually uh or in a cavalier manner and uh so paul suggested before the eucharist you
were to prepare yourself and have a purification ceremony well that's the same thing before the
mysteries before the they had the experience in the leucis they were in a lineup uh doing purification
rituals on the way uh to their center where they were going to be given their sacred drink after
their purification so now their sacred drink cateen having had the lsa the lysergic acid
amide in it would induce an a psychoactive a psychotropic experience where they're seeing
visions and colors and and bright glorious imagery that they can't explain by any natural means
they they didn't have this is a pre scientific world they didn't know that their drink was spiked
they didn't know how these things happen to them they were getting a contact experience
with god himself and so just imagine a profound it would be if you were having an lsd experience
and not knowing that they're lsd and you've got a shaman of some kind telling you this is god
reaching into you are you is god talking to you yet are you feeling it yet is he getting into you
yet yeah oh he is oh wow okay and so these guys are gonna go through the roof especially
when they started out in a dark context and then all of a sudden at a key point the people who are
the masters of these mysteries they knew when people how long it would take for this stuff to
kick in so okay uh the the sand in the hourglass has reached the bottom the other peeking now okay
out with the drums out with the mirror shining bright lights on them uh out with the the girls
and dancing things and and uh silk garments and the bright lights on them and also these people
think they're seeing angels and they're hearing choirs sing you know and the whole thing you
combine this with psychoactive substances and you've got uh the equivalent of uh pink floyd concert
with that with that being said you do something really cool care because you actually
give the concoction they have found the concoction so it do you think that's what's going on in acts
when it talks about they were uh the gifts of the holy spirit and stuff do you think there's some type
of everybody's in the house they're all uh it appears that there's fire on their tongues or over
their heads and like i think i mean you've got to be trippin and i agree by the way that uh i've
experienced psychedelics and a variety of different kinds and i know what you're saying
makes a lot of sense so i'm listening i'm just trying to follow you on all this okay i would
like to find the place where i put in about the uh the eucharist uh with the eucharist
paul has flipped everything from the dead sea scroll community and changed everything around
uh the dead sea scroll community had their promotions uh they were a militaristic kind
of compound and they had rank and it's interesting that the new testament says that jesus's own
apostles argued about which rank everybody had so this is another parallel and one got an increase
in their rank uh after a yearly review and their yearly review occurred at pentecost
so that's an important link right there uh when those who are being advanced to the highest levels
of rank were there were three levels of initiation at kumran and if you're being advanced to the
highest level initiation you are then admitted to a special meal that the others did not have
so this sounds like anthogens again uh when you look at the parallel community to the
dead sea scroll community that was in egypt that pliny referred to i'm sorry phylo
do not say pliny as the therapeutic the uh he he describes them and it sounds like
the dead sea scroll community by their theology even though he's using uh greek terms and and
philosophy philosophical terms rather than theological terms in the description he describes
them as seekers after wisdom and he describes the overseer as the president of a society
the so he uses all the greek terms but he uh gives enough information to let us know that
the dead sea scroll community uh he had they have what they uh he called allegory we would call the
pestering commentaries uh that he mentioned uh songs of thanksgiving well we actually have a
scroll from kumran actually called the songs of thanksgiving there uh there's a number of different
things it said that they they went about their duties uh in a zealous manner and we know that zeal
was one of the big themes of the dead sea scroll community uh and uh that they avoided any semblance
or appearance of anybody being a slave so those who were helping with the serving of the meals etc
they didn't dress in the kind of servers garments that slaves usually had and all
and they want no appearance of that so these people were very much attached to liberty very
similar to the dead sea scroll community uh it matches in many ways but the descriptions of their
sacred meal uh they describe the bread uh they say flavored with hissa but i think the the initiates
and uh knew the the actual ingredients were other herbs other than just hissa yeah and the
the new testament talks about the bread that they had and that it had a healing purpose when you
have the uh syrophoenician woman uh begging for healing for her sick child jesus says well it's
not fitting to give the children's bread to the dogs now that matches the dead sea scroll's uh
tension with the Gentiles and uh their attitude towards the Gentiles and their their uh
putting them down calling them dogs that's just approach that's exactly the way they would have
thought of them and the idea though that was it was the children's bread that was the solution for
the healing that means there was there were ingredients in the bread even the new testament
again indicates there was something in the bread so there's something in the oil there's
something in the bread uh when we look at the uh new testament pattern of healing they used the
annoying oil uh we have that in mark six i believe mark three or mark six we have it in
james five that the church used it for healing anybody sick at the elders they'll pray over them
use the annoying oil well the formula for the annoying oil is saying that there's cannabis in
there and it was cannabis soaked into olive oil now it turns out that of the natural ingredients
that we have available to us as solvents for the cannabinoids olive oil and coconut oil are the two
most effective scientifically at actually absorbing the active psychoactive ingredients
and the healthy ingredients it's not just the thc that gets you high that's a health ingredient
but there are a number of other active ingredients cannabinoids uh uh cannabinoid and cannabidiol
that are also very uh healing that's the cannabic chromine cannabiberin uh a whole long list of other
cannabinoids and all of them are are dissolved into an olive oil base beautifully so if they were
they were well informed about how to do uh their cannabis concentrate now when they did heal people
with it we've got a list of the people who are healed by the new testament healing traditions
and they match people uh who get exemptions for cannabis exemption here in Canada now
where I live in Canada you can get a medical cannabis exemption if you have medical conditions
for which it's appropriate I have a medical exemption for cannabis use myself and it's
for my arthritis well there you go the lame walk the uh cannabis also stops helps to return uh
control of your muscles to your nerves and also stops spastic uh shaking for people with
muscular dysprophy or muscular sclerosis so again it made the lame to walk uh if somebody had eczema
and they were giving a cannabis oil anointing eczema responds to cannabis oil and olive oil
and uh all of a sudden they say oh the lepers were healed because lexima would have been called
leprosy back in their day uh somebody who has glaucoma gets anointed with the cannabis oil
and all of a sudden that reduces the intraocular pressure in their site returns
and also no case of blind are healed uh somebody who has epileptic seizures uh we know
that cannabis oil is more effective than anti other any other anti convulsing we have
and uh so you you anoint somebody with epilepsy and the seizures stop then in their day they'd
be saying oh he cast out the demons so everything fits like a glove for cannabis being the active
ingredient in this anointing oil and we know that is mentioned by name in the Hebrew in the Old
Testament well it's hands down we got it you're you are such a heretic and I love it so much um
so what about you touched his up are you suggesting there were drugs inside of that when they went
to give it to jesus according to the gospels or is this a common theme there because why would they
be giving him a cover name for other antigens it may be a cover name for the other antigens or uh
or uh distortion or cover up of the antigens to say you know we don't want you to know what's in
here so we're just going to call it this because the ingredients were secret and it was a death
penalty to reveal the secrets of the misbe religions in Rome so the in the Roman Empire
so you weren't allowed to do that so they would say something else other than what it really was
so let me ask you this one more uh to follow up with that do you think the swoon theory has
any possibilities because could they have drug this yeah they drug jesus this is how it goes
they drug jesus um he ends up uh somehow still surviving this drug intoxicated things yeah i
yeah i i'm familiar with the Passover plot idea and the uh it's a creative way of looking at the
history uh it was an early advocation of revising the story and saying there may be another alternative
explanation other than the one we've been handed and uh i give him credit for being willing to look
at alternatives there i just don't concur that he's hit the right solution on it uh so i don't buy
into the Passover plot there uh uh some people do uh i think they're in a minority of a minority of
people that are buying into that but the the idea that there are other other explanations other than
the ones we've been handed though uh is worthy of consideration and it should not be just dismissed
offhand especially since uh it's not just Hebrew culture but all these many other cultures
when i made that list of uh that paragraph i read to begin with i made a long list of cultures
that you know used cannabis as as an incision and the list of cultures that used the corridor
pottery is absolutely staggering uh so it was so broad a thing uh let me just continue a bit with
some of the quotes about the Greek mysteries i have a few more uh well we don't have to quote them all
but we'll quote just a few thrice happier those are mortals who having seen those rights depart
for Hades for them alone it is granted to have true life there to the rest all there is evil
that Sophocles uh fragment 719 uh pindar uh fragment 102 says happy is he who having seen
these rights go below the hollow earth for he knows the end of life and he knows it's god sent
beginning uh skoli asked it was a common belief in Athens that whoever been taught the mysteries
would when he died be deemed worthy of divine glory hence all were eager for initiation now
here's an important one Pausanias says my dream forbade me to describe what is within the wall
of the sanctuary here's part of the restrictions on don't reveal the mysteries and surely it is
clear that the uninitiated may not lawfully hear that from the side of which they have been debarred
yeah so
now uh all ancient epiphany were of a character of dazzling light here's a porphyry says the eye
of the body cannot bear the brightness of divine apparitions that from Demisterius uh 2a the experience
of apululis uh i saw the sun shining at midnight and adoravi deproximo refers to such an append
epiphany uh in the adisk called hail bridegroom hail new light announced the epiphany interesting
that the epiphany of this entheogenic uh savior uh god that they are being introduced to was
referred to as the bridegroom again a parallel to jesus idea uh by mystic identification lucius
after the sacrament of initiation was arrayed like the sun and set up like an image of the god
before the spectators that's an apululis i have a hard time pronouncing his name apululis uh
metamorphosis on 1124 the mysties of adis became himself adis you became the one with the god
the uh here's a a greek papyrus that was has preserved a magical prayer based on hermetic
theology in which occurred the words quote enter thou into my spirit and my thoughts my whole life
long for thou art i and i am thou thy name i guard as a charm in my heart uh in a similar prayer
we read uh i know the hermes thou knowest me i am thou and thou art i so you they become merged
with the the divine being so if you uh have a mystery religion uh from jesus you become merged
with the sun and so you become sons yeah so there's there's a lot of this this is gold this is gold
because all this does parallel the new testament and it makes you really ask yourself what is this
and uh the mystery school angle i think is important it's very important but it seems like one is a
hellonized mystery school and the other one is non-hellonized so there's a competing faction
going on exactly exactly the the dead sea schools are a non-hellonized mystery school uh they're
purely Hebrew mystery school uh and uh here's another interesting parallel to the uh hellonized
mystery schools uh to the to the pauline jesus movement uh you hear a lot of people saying you
must be born again the idea i said quote this this is from the liturgy of mithra from their liturgy
i a man born a mortal womb having been this day begotten again by thee out of so many
myriads rendered immortal in this hour by the good will of god in his abounding goodness
so this is part of a liturgy where you're rendered immortal because you're being begotten again
and you're becoming a son of god uh this is a this is the good end uh those who have attained
knowledge namely deification we read in the hermetic literature that's in poimandres 126
which recalls the famous statement of pleminence andria that the true gnostic practices being god
yeah in the thanksgiving prayer of the perfect word occurs the expression saved by thee we rejoice
that even our mortal bodies thou disdeify us by the vision of thyself uh that's a greek text uh
it's uh are you telling me that the jesus that we're seeing in the new testament may well be
very calling himself equal to god because of this mystery school stuff and the outsiders are saying
belaspheme no no no uh again the dead she's girl community was very hebrew they weren't
hellenized and they very carefully maintained that you were being uh honored by god in your
initiation you are being granted approval by god in your initiation uh you are being granted a
guarantee of immortality uh paul called it the down payment or arabona of the spirit
so this that's very similar to what these mystery schools are saying you've got this
experience and all sudden your spirit is made divine and you're unified uh with the gods well
the hebrews agreed with everything except that you were made divine just that you were made a mortal
so you're made that now you don't have to fear death and this matches the new testament idea
you don't have to fear fear not one who can destroy the body
but cannot destroy the soul now interesting enough that doesn't fit the old testament idea
the old testament idea in genesis uh one or genesis two rather is that uh gods there molding
man his hands are in the mud and uh by the way the genesis two was the always version of the creation
story as opposed to the elwes version in chapter one and the always version was the version of the
poor folk these are the people who had to work for a living uh and uh they had division of lair
where the women were in the house doing the meals and grabbing the herbs in the garden and the men
were out doing the hunting etc and bringing the meat home they are going to war when necessary
etc etc but these guys because they were close to nature they felt close to god their version of
god god actually kissed life into them instead just commanding them commanding them the old the first
genesis story is the elwes version the elwes version is the urban and rich person's version
of the genesis story now in the the rich people's version well these people didn't have division
of labor they had servants to do everything so they didn't do labor at all and the women in their
household were able to give servants orders so the women were ordered ordering men around
so the women had equal rights and i get a spiritual truth from this one by the way
two spiritual truths one if you give women equal rights they will believe that they are
closer to god so their version of creation story men and women were created instantly
together at the same time called out of nothing together they had they and so there's no subservient
relationship between women to men it's it's an equal relationship and these women felt
their spirituality was elevated by just simply giving them equal rights i mean it's a spiritual
truth yeah then when you look at the uh and when this when the rich people get something done how
do they do it they command and it happens they give an order and it goes out and and and it gets
done all they have to do is give the command and the rest takes care of itself yeah so that's how
the creation story god and their creations are their god was created in their image and then
the second version these people wrote they're working the land they have their hands in the mud
so so does their god and their god kisses life into them their god is much more intimate so
that tells me a spiritual truth that if you're in contact with nature and living in harmony with
nature you're going to feel like god is closer to you so i think these are spiritual truths so
while we're tossing out the primitive ideas of religion we can get inspired ideas of genuine
spirituality uh by understanding the real history so we're not really tearing down everything we don't
have to throw the baby out with the bathwater and that's uh so i think there's a lot to be learned
from that so the they had a jewish idea and they were human all the way they didn't believe themselves
to become divine like the greeks did in their idea but they did believe themselves out of guarantee
now the romans the roman military they lined up just like we know it earlier people saying people
were eager to become an initiate of the mysteries to get this guarantee well the the roman soldiers
fought to the death not fearing death because they didn't figure there was any such thing as
death for them anymore and if someone's not afraid to die they're a scary person to fight
yeah so they you're gonna have a lot more effectiveness with that and the romans knew
it so they encouraged the soldiers to line up for these mysteries the dead sea scroll community
they knew they were fighting this kind of soldier so they wanted to arm their own soldiers with the
exact same kind of courage if you're not those who can destroy the body but are not able to destroy
the soul that sounds like preparation for war the kind of preaching you would have for someone to say
don't worry about becoming a soldier and uh oh but what about my crops i can't plant my crops
consider the lilies of the field and the birds of the air they so not neither do they toil they
don't plant crops yet god has consideration of them how much more are you worthy than they are
so come and join the army quit worrying about the crops but i've got to bury my friend i got to
bury my dad or my uncle or whatever you know let the dead bury they're dead we've got a job to do
you're conscripted let's go yeah i actually saw a documentary um about hitler uh
talking about how you know the pretty much he was trying to create super soldiers and of course
they had utilized they had german scientists who were involved in creating what was pretty much
proto meth i mean it was it was amphetamine um and other concoctions and they weren't the only
ones that were doing this during world war two um i know britain the thules society used entheogens
for their uh own development enhancement of their ideas so and the thules society was part of the
whole german thing uh and then there was a lot of mysticism with uh what was her name madame
blavatsky hitler was a big fan of her her gibberish anyway so yeah there's a lot of i don't really
want to get into uh hitler's thing now so the road to elusis uh came out to this book saying
there are psychoactive substances used in these mysteries this was the first time this was ever
brought to scholarly attention and uh so i'm very pleased that uh such a scholar like dr ruck
was able to write forward to a couple of my books so uh there's quite a feather in my own hat
and bragging now i guess i shouldn't do that but i am anyways uh let's uh where do i want to go
here from that from there let's start with some illustrations shall we um oh well we're running
we're running low on time just so you know um maybe you take us uh on a final journey through
something that you particularly want to touch on because we have to do more series on this uh this
is way too much information to cover in this episode um but what we'll do is you take us on a final um
lesson about this and then you can close out and tell them how to contact and what we need to do
all right here's here's here's one i'm gonna put my Sherlock Holmes hat on i got a deer hunter
here my Sherlock Holmes hat uh there was a mystery uh across the soviet union
many many different cultures uh were using what was called funnelware uh funnel beaker
pottery and this is called trb pottery and they changed to a new type of pottery called
corded wear pottery but they didn't just do it here they did it up here and over here and over
here and over here all across the map and we're talking a map that's 3000 4000 miles wide we're
talking the soviet union steplands from the ukraine all the way across uh iran across uh
pakistan across above india uh right into china right up into mongolia so this is a
broad swath of land and people are saying archaeologists are saying oh wait a minute usually
when there's a development in archaeological patterns it shows up in a scattered manner
elsewhere and slowly gets distributed it normally isn't everybody swaps to the next new thing all
at once across this large large area that's just how does that happen so quickly all at once
and then the corded wear pottery switched over to a met a corded wear metallurgy and
it did that across the whole swath all at once again as well and seemed like every new advance
uniformly stepped forward everywhere and they're saying how can that happen it turns out that cannabis
played a pivotal role in uh and horseback riding and to to put those pieces together we have to know
about two cultures the sithians and the batai uh the batai culture uh in in southern ukraine
where the first culture uh approximately uh 6000 bc they were already uh domesticating horses
but they domesticated the horses as food like cattle they actually milked the horses and we have
samples of milk cheese products from horse milk uh in some of their containers preserved in the
archaeology uh so they they had horses but they had them for food not for riding until they met the
sithians the sithians came along and introduced them to cannabis and cannabis rope and cannabis
products cannabis entheogens etc now some enterprising cannabis using batai then came up
with the idea of a hemp bit for the horse and all of a sudden the horse became rideable
yeah so it was this it was the introduction of hemp to the batai culture that was the very first
impetus for horseback riding and then the just as the sithians had brought the hemp to the batai
the batai brought the horseback riding the sithians and from there on the sithians were
traveling that full swath of the steplands on horseback and that's why every new invention
someone came up with a new type of pottery well the cordyware pottery was called cordyware because
they used the hemp ropes and made an impression on the pottery while it was still soft to make a
hemp cord indentation this was to mark the pottery pottery was used to hold various sacred
ingredients and this was their way of marking the pottery to say what this pottery is going to be
used for and we've actually found the cannabis preserved in the cordyware pottery to know that
that was what it was there for here is an example of the cordyware pottery uh with the hemp markings
on it now they they made sure that the cordy the the cordyware pottery indicates cannabis was in here
when they had jars for opium here's the opium poppy they made their jars look like an upside down
like an opium poppy head yeah so again and they found the opium that was associated with those jars
very very similarly we have more of the cordyware pottery from different curgan burial grounds the uh
in the Peru when they had jars for storing coca they had coca leaf impressions on the jar
yeah so entheogens around the world and here's more poppy type jars for poppy jugs
there's poppies in there her errors ornamentation what goddess of poppy so the entheogens were
a big part of everything now a shaman a traveling shaman got a lot of respect here this fellow
this fellow right here is obviously a white guy a Caucasian what was he doing buried in China
with a pound and a half of bud in the in the Taklamakan desert which is frozen and cold this is
over 2 000 years old 2600 year old cannabis right here and it's still green
and the crystals which you normally are are are like white crystals in your cannabis bud
have turned to red with aging the extracts of cannabis oil by the way one of the extracts
is a cherry oil or red oil of cannabis in the medical literature was used in
the British journal Lancet that's how they refer to it now entheogens had a role in different
religions let's just take a look at seaside the goddess of wisdom and knowledge and goddess of
measurement for Egypt you'll see here that there's a cannabis plant above her head there's a close
up of it here in one of the drawings you can carefully see a cannabis plant above her head
there's a cannabis plant above her head here cannabis plant above her head here yeah now she
was a guy some measurements the Egyptians use measuring rods of hemp ropes that were covered
in grease so that they wouldn't gain moisture because the moisture would change the length of
the rope a little bit so they covered them in grease and they use these for measuring sticks
when they're building the pyramids yeah so this uh it came in handy there uh as far as um magic
mushrooms go the aminida muscaria this is the aminida muscaria mushroom now i want you to take
a look at some of the iconography here's mother mary look at her headdress it looks like a dried
aminida muscaria here is a medieval salter uh showing jesus and his disciples around a table
that looks like an aminida muscaria the uh here are pictures of adam and eve eating from the tree
of life and it's an entheogenic plant here it looks like the aminida muscaria and they're using
mushroom caps to cover their genitals in the picture uh here is a picture from the sharks
cathedral uh in france and here again you have entheogens pictured as part of their religious
iconography so these things remain secrets uh for many years and only certain people hinted at them
by putting their evidence up in uh plain sight here's adam and eve with um entheogenic trees of
life you've got magic mushroom and you got mandrake together there here's another picture of the
mandrake plant to make comparisons uh between the mandrake imagery here yeah here's another
medieval salter let's go ahead and get it there with jesus and uh magic mushrooms again for the
for the for the eucharist yeah now uh all of these things uh show that there there was a role for
these things uh don allegro you mentioned earlier he suggests that there was uh a play on words being
used with the the famous passage about peter uh you're peter and on this peter i'll build my church
yeah what was it now the catholics say it's uh petros you're your peter and on this rock i'll
build my church well that's a nice play on words sounds like peter's name petra petros
similar enough okay sounds like makes sense just one fatal flaw it's greek they didn't speak greek
jesus uh spoke to his disciples and called it simon bar jonah well bar isn't greek it's aramaic
son of jonah yeah so they weren't speaking greek so your play on words can't be in greek right away
you know you got to cover up it's a rewrite again and more that's the theme of the of the new
testament to rewrite yeah so jon allegro said if we're going to seek a play on words they have to
be a word in aramaic and there is a word that sounds like peter in aramaic and it's pronounced
peter and jon allegro identifies it as the aramaic word for the amanita muscaria mushroom which is
psychoactive which we showed you there and uh gives you a rather uh trippy unusual experience
as a beautiful part of my research i actually tried the amanita muscaria
and i did have a hallucinatory imagery which was very very vivid and very realistic in appearance so
they uh it's uh it does have effect i i love this thank you so much for sharing this so far
because i know there's so much more um and i've had similar well different i haven't touched
amanita muscaria but this is something i think we need to pick up on next time and go deeper into
some of these areas and in your research and ladies and gentlemen if you're watching this
be sure to check out um the book you can get it 25 bucks he's done extensive research it's a legit um
it's legit and i'm looking at these images you saw the images it's it's got pictures and it's
written it's well sourced uh you need to check it out any closing statements you'd like to make
uh yes don't try amanita muscaria yourself in unsupervised conditions or any other psychoactive
substance uh if you're not familiar with it and you're not brought up in that culture uh you may
not know the appropriate steps for using them uh so keep that in mind cannabis is completely safe
go ahead and use that to your heart's content but the uh the other ones uh be cautious about those
and i'm not good making these statements to suggest that people should go and try all these different
things uh i'm not saying they shouldn't try them either the uh it's a matter of do it under controlled
scientific conditions and know your own limitations and don't go making foolish attempts to discover
things in an area where you can harm yourself and put yourself in a condition where you can't
look after your own needs i don't want to be responsible for that thank you guys for listening
to myth vision podcast we have ch lawson christopher lawson he shared with us some
interesting things and it's very simple but the entire ancient world has been consumed
with drug use and it still goes on until today we're going to continue this discussion uh we're
not done because there's a lot more information we didn't cover and we're going to have mr christopher
back to discover or to discuss the dead sea scrolls and how they're influenced on the new
testament and what we see going on in the first century there who jesus is etc please share this
like this subscribe because it helps us grow help us to grow and um if you want to be a
contributor go down there and make sure you uh put something in the paypal to help us out
