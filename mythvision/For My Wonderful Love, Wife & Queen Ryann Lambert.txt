Hey friends. So my wife's birthday is coming up. Her name is Ryan. So I had this special song made
for her and I'm just so excited that I felt like I needed to let everyone hear this song.
I had wrote out what needed to be said and I went to this app called Songfinch.com and they
had an amazing artist named Keegan Boast. I don't see him on there anymore. I'm actually
sang this song. So I wanted you to be part of that and hearing what I had made for my
wonderful wife and of course I know the platforms are not made for this but nonetheless
too excited not to share it with you.
And you would date in my brother.
I never thought you'd be the one so we met at Middle Beach that spring break in South Carolina
and we'd write letters and I know it all started when we were young.
And I can't imagine a life that gets better than this. Everything that's happened oh I wouldn't
change a thing from popping your fingers in the morning till you writing on my back with a pen.
When I'm with you Ryan I know that I'm right at home.
Yeah we were still just kids and we made a promise to spend forever and always together
and you gave me three sons oh I've never loved anyone the way that I love you forever
and I want to say thank you for 15 years. Don't know what I'd do if you weren't here
because I can't imagine a life that gets better than this. Everything that's happened
oh I wouldn't change a thing from popping your fingers in the morning till you writing on my back
with a pen. When I'm with you Ryan I know that I'm right at home oh I'm right at home
oh I'm right at home
oh
no I can't imagine a life that gets better than this. Everything that's happened oh I wouldn't
change a thing from popping your fingers in the morning till you writing on my back with a pen.
When I'm with you Ryan I know that I'm right at home
oh I'm right at home
