copy so I'm a lucky man and that means Dr. Collins has been reading Dr. Hendel and that tells you
scholars pay attention to scholars so I highly recommend you guys check out his work his books
are down in the description of this video and you can get all that you want Dr. Hendel tell us
something about yourself and the topic about giants today that we're going to be probing into
okay well I'm only about six feet tall so I'm just a normal human being but we're going to talk
about giants in the Bible today who were considerably larger so I'm just an ordinary professor of the
Hebrew Bible at the University of California Berkeley and this is the stuff that I did so
it's kind of fun to talk about I'm a teacher I'm a writer and the musician that's it awesome
so giants it seems how do I put this when I look at the mythological Greco-Roman world for example
and I see there's kind of these folktales of these like really massive large people
Enochian literature you know almost has I think a 300 foot or some crazy massive-sized giant
we know this is mythology but we look at the Bible when we go oh no no that's not mythology
there's history to this and there are people on YouTube they get a hell of a lot more views than
me it upsets me and they create these crazy fictional we have 30 foot bones that we found
of humans that were giants and people actually believe in this so we're not really addressing
the fact that whether this is literally true or not we're saying yes this is myth but what does
the Bible say about giants and maybe what does antiquity have to say about the subject matter
as it relates to the Bible good yeah well the people who are saying this I mean the they're
saying things that are similar to things that people were saying in biblical times and so what
we want to look at is is the biblical testimony about giants and how that probably relates to
things like 30 feet bones that you just mentioned they had these in the ancient world and they didn't
know about dinosaurs so they assumed that they were large people so there are clues around
both in you know excavations but also in landscapes that make people think that there were giants once
in the world and we're you know we in in modernity are skeptical of this but we're a minority okay
most people are perfectly happy with giants for example if you go to Stonehenge who built that
who could build these huge stones into a big circle so in you know traditional British folklore
one of the ideas that Merlin was the architect and he had these giants come and build the buildings
build Stonehenge for him so this is kind of a natural even kind of scientific inference from
these things that are so large in the Middle East similar things happen if you ask to a peasant
an Egyptian peasant in the 19th century who built the pyramids he would have said giants
because after all who could build such a large thing there are also you know stone structures
like Stonehenge in the Middle East and so some of these people traditionally refer to them as
having been built by giants so these are clues that are in the world that are in the landscape that
are in ancient architecture that are in old ruins and so the idea that giants once roamed the earth
is a kind of normal inference based on these kinds of clues and so this is this is stuff that you
find in the bible as well now if you want to look at the the biography of these giants it starts
in a wonderful little passage in Genesis chapter 6 it's a strange little story it says
the the sons of god were on the earth and they saw the human women and the human women were
beautiful and so they went down and had sex with them and took wives from them and they
made these mixed breed offspring half human and half divine who are called nifilene and these
are called the heroes of old the men of renown now who the nifileme are is obscure okay it just
says that these are the the warriors of old the men of renown or the heroes of old the men of renown
it sounds a little bit like greek mythology right okay so in greek mythology Zeus comes down and he's
very horny and he has sex with lots of human women and they bear these offspring who are heroes
like hercules for example hercules is big strong you know half human half god they're called demigods
many of the heroes in the trojan war in in the Homer's Iliad are of this mixed parentage where
one of their parents is a god and one of their parents is a human like Achilles his mother was
a goddess his father was a king a human king and so Achilles too is a mixed creature a demigod
half human half divine and so he's really large and he's really strong so this sounds like this
story of the sons of god and the daughters of humans in genesis six that the gods have sex
with human women and their offspring are these mixed creatures who are giants now it doesn't say
in genesis that they're giants it just says that these are heroes and that they're called the nifileme
but already by the time the old greek translation of the of the Hebrew bible was made
the greek translators translate nifileme as giants in one case so in the understanding of this story
in ancient israel the idea developed that these mixed offspring were giants right now
as i said it's not explicit in genesis but it says well it says in genesis that the nifileme were on
the earth in those days and also afterward so there's a little bit of a clue there that the
story of the nifileme is not over yet that you haven't heard the last of them so you jump to the
book of numbers when you have the age of moses and the israelites and they're wandering through the
desert and they're coming up into the promised land there's a wonderful little story in numbers 13
and 14 where moses sends some some spies into the land into the promised land to spy it out so they
can see if they you know if they go in to conquer them whether it will be difficult are these powerful
people and so forth so he sends in this group of spies and they spy out the land and they come to
a place where moses sends them to have grown in the judaean highlands and they come back and they
say we saw giants there we saw the nifileme there we saw these other this other name anakim and
it's clear that they're talking about giants here's here's a description of what they what they report
back to moses they say we came to the land that you see which you sent us and it is indeed flowing
with milk and honey and this is its fruit and they have this huge fruit that they brought back from
there a single cluster of grapes that's on a big stick that two people have to carry so the fruit is
huge um it is flowing with milk and honey this is its fruit however the people who live in this
land are strong and the cities are fortified and very great and there we saw the children of anak
and these are giants um they say there we there we also saw the nifileme the children of anak are
from the nifileme and we seemed in our eyes like grasshoppers and so we seemed in their eyes in other
words the the Israelites look in comparison to the nifileme and the anakim like grasshoppers look
to humans that's the massive difference of stature and so they are terrified they come back and say
there's giants in the land we can't defeat them okay I heard people try to rationalize this too
I mean I know you know all about it being a scholar in this area just in in Hebrew studies but
there are people who go well that's just um what what would you use the technical term for something
like that it's just an analogy they're saying that they're just really bigger than us the Israelites
are probably five foot tall and these guys are probably six foot five and so they're saying
they're really really they're so much bigger than us but that's an exaggeration of language
is the way they would approach it well it is an analogy but if you look like a grasshop if you
look to someone else like a grasshopper looks to you right the point of the analogy is that they are
huge right okay and and part of the analogy also is to them not only do we look like insects in
stature but if we went to war with them they would step on us they would destroy us as easily as we
would destroy a grasshopper and they would just crush us I mean literally they'd step on us and
crush us and we don't have a chance against them right uh Moses later says uh the people who dwell
he says it is a people greater and taller than us and great cities fortified up to heaven and there
we saw the children of the anakin so the people report this to moses and moses later repeats it
so moses also thinks that these are greater taller people cities fortified up to heaven
that's pretty tall okay we have what we call skyscrapers so these are the ancient equivalent
of skyscrapers where these giant people live now it doesn't say here how big they are okay but it
does say elsewhere how big they are um there's another group called the uh rifaim uh there's
another group called the ameem the zamzumeem uh there's all sorts of giant different groups of
giants that inhabit the land of Canaan the Judean highlands like this region around Hebron but the
in Ammon there's ancestral giants in Moab there's ancestral giants so on the east bank of the Jordan
west bank of the Jordan all of these places had ancestral giants now one of these giants
that the Israelites come into conflict with is named Ag king of Baytian and there's another
little thing that says Deuteronomy chapter three for only this is moses speaking for only Ag king
of Baytian was left of the remnant of the rifaim rifaim is one of the names of these giants behold
his bed an iron bed is it not in Rabat of the children of Ammon nine cubits is its length and
four cubits is its width according to the common cubit so here they say how tall they are I mean
this is very clear and a cubit let me just see if I can remember a cubit is like the length of your
arm so it's like 18 inches so if he is nine if his bed is nine cubits long gosh how tall is that
so it's about a foot and a half times nine yeah what is that so we got what four and a half
feet long huh like 14 feet long or something it's pretty pretty bad yeah that's that's pretty big
oh yeah here it is yeah his his eye his bed is I calculated yeah it's
roughly 13.5 feet long and six feet wide now that's bigger than a king size bed
13 feet long and six feet wide that's that's the size of a giant okay so here we have an actual
figure which is kind of cool now who's who's and notice that it says that his bed is still on display
is it not in Rabat of the children of Ammon behold his bed in other words you can go see it
so Ag the king of Baish in this giant he's he's not there anymore you can see his bed there's a
little display on the side of the road when you take the exit of Rabat of Ammon this is this is
the modern city of Ammon in Jordan you take the exit there's a little sign there that says
pull off here to see Ag's bed you know five shekels gets you in and you see it and it's this huge
thing that's 14 feet by six feet and it says here it's made out of iron which is kind of odd
because what what they actually was in this region in in modern Jordan in the region of Ammon and
Moab and stuff are these huge stone structures megalithic structures that we call dolmans
and they're huge stones that are supported by by stones underneath them and traditionally in
the Middle East these are these are called the tables of giants or sometimes the beds of giants
okay these are actually early Bronze Age burial chambers that they're made with these massive
stones that are roughly this size 16 feet long by six feet wide as is the big horizontal
capstone and it's supported by two stones on the side and in the early Bronze Age people were
buried underneath them so they were burial chambers and they were very monumental and
maybe for wealthy people or something like that but there are literally thousands of them
in the region of Jordan and northern Israel okay so I think it's pretty clear that one of these
huge dolmans was identified with the bed of King Ag and again it's precisely because all of these
dolmans are there that people took those as the evidence for these ancient giants now one of the
one of the key things about these ancient giants is that by biblical times or by the time these
books are being written of the Bible all the giants are dead they're all gone there aren't anymore
you can go to Ammon and see Ag's bed on display but you can't see the giants anymore because they're
all dead and this is actually one of the one of the resonances of their names the name Nifilim
literally means fallen one which is an idiom for a dead person like in the in David's lament over
King Saul and Jonathan he says how the mighty have fallen how the warriors have fallen because
Jonathan and Saul have fallen in battle so the fallen ones literally means the dead people
okay so the Nifilim these are giants who are all now dead the Riffaeim another name for them
also has another meaning of the spirits of the dead the spirits of the dead are called the Riffaeim
so the Riffaeim who once were giants are a subset of people who have died and now they're Riffaeim
in the underworld and now they're the spirits of the dead so many of the terms for these giants
are related to terms for people who are now dead I'm actually heard this is the idea of who these
ancient giants were that they were the indigenous inhabitants of the land of Canaan and all of
the people who live there now have somehow displaced them or defeated them in one way or the other
I've heard that in the ancient world they believed earthquakes were due to the to the underworld
Riffaeim if you will or these giants that are in the dark in the underworld bumping into the
walls from time to time is that true I haven't heard that about the Middle East I haven't heard
that about I don't know that that's true about the ancient period that I study but I wouldn't be
surprised if it's part of you know medieval folklore or something like that yeah I just that
was something I heard I can't remember the source I think Dr. Price Dr. Robert Price mentioned that
they thought well these earthquakes are because these either it might have been Titans in the
Greek mythology or something but yeah somehow underneath the world they're bumped into a wall
because there's no lights down there and it's like oh man that would to me that would make more sense
for the for the Greek world and the Scandinavian mythology I think I've heard that the the giants
are playing games or something like that in heaven and so that earthquakes and things like that I
think you will find world folklore where you'll have ideas like that and a lot of these cultures
have giants in American culture do you know where the Great Lakes come from yeah what the glaciers
are you talking about no I'm actually talking about Paul Bunyan's ox oh okay okay okay why there's
so many lakes in Minnesota no tell me Paul Bunyan's ox what was his name big red or something
I mean he's a giant Paul Bunyan's a giant and his ox was was a big giant and the ox's footprints
made all these lakes oh my gosh uh so we have giants too in our folklore and these are creatures
that created in particular created aspects of the landscape giant lakes giant formations these are
things that one attributes to giants and so the ancient near east was no different when you had
these stone these massive stone structures these old that they didn't know that they were early
Bronze Age burial sites they assumed that they were beds or tables of giants okay and so this gives
rise to some of these ideas let me let me tell you another thing in the landscape that gives rise to
the ideas I mentioned that when Moses sends out the scouts they go to Hevron to the region of the
Judean highlands a number of places in the Judean highlands including Hevron have these massive
ruins of middle Bronze Age cities that had huge fortified walls around them okay so in the
excavations at at Hevron they found these massive stone things and these were in the middle Bronze
Age they were protective walls around the city and they're really huge and they're wide and so you
can't get over them you can't tunnel under them this this was the you know defensive architecture
of the time they used these huge stones that could be as much as six feet long to build these stones
okay and so when you see these stones today or in Israelite times you say how could anyone
build these walls with stones that big and so they they called them and this actually does
this comes from Greek mythology archaeologists to this day called them called them cyclopean walls
okay because they're built with these massive stones do you know what the cyclops are cyclops
yeah oh yeah the one-eyed giants the one-eyed giants so this this practice of building these
cyclopean walls was also found in some of the old Greek cities the Mycenaean cities the walls of
Mycenae the walls of Tirans and when archaeologists discovered that well not when archaeologists
when the ancient Greeks saw these ruins of their old Greek sites they said oh these must have been
built by the cyclops by the giants okay so Aristotle even says that the cyclops built
these great walls of Mycenaean Tirans all these old great Mycenaean cities that were in ruins at the
time so when archaeologists dig in Hevron and other biblical sites even in Jerusalem
in Gath in other places they find these cyclopean walls they call them cyclopean walls
which literally means they were built by giants okay because cyclops so when ancient Israelites
settled in the land of Israel and they would come to a place like Hevron they would see these
cyclopean walls and they said oh my god who could have built these and the answer obviously is giants
and this is another clue in the landscape that gives rise to stories like Moses sending the spies
and they come back and say look these indigenous inhabitants inhabitants of the land in Hevron
and elsewhere are giants so we can still to this day see the same stones that they saw
by which the idea arises that the original inhabitants of this place were giants which
gives like clear evidence to me as to why people still think when they look at this in their puzzle
that how they could have built some of these things or how do they get that giant stone moved
it must be giants because they can't imagine that there was an apparatus at that time that
they could see a maneuvering clever way to leverage or use gravity to their advantage
or whatever it might be I've heard various theories but they just can't they almost neglect
the critical scientific method on this and just say no no no you guys are ignoring the fact
that these myths are true and they really were extremely strong if not why are these stories
I hear the same thing and I don't want to rabbit your about ancient aliens don't say stuff well
the gods come from the heavens therefore dull aliens we see unidentified objects blah blah
blah all these claims so they just like are validating their already preconceived notions
about something that are just kind of working in their favor rather than using a scientific
method in my opinion yes oh that's absolutely true but what I would emphasize is that they're
doing the same things that people did in antiquity right you see this stuff and you say oh my god I
couldn't possibly lift a stone that big it must have been a giant in our technological world
you know we might not have that many people that believe in giants although I think we actually do
I was in northern California recently and bigfoot is this huge thing up there he's a giant
but a lot of people would prefer a kind of technological version of a giant which would
be an alien right someone with superhuman capabilities superhuman strength even superhuman
technology since we're a technologically oriented world and so nowadays you have people talking about
ancient astronauts and it's aliens who built the pyramids not giants who built the pyramid
but it's the same kind of explanation it's not scientific right it's a kind of renewal of ancient
folklore with a modern technological kind of coloring to it it's so the people who say that
are doing the same things that the people were doing in the bible I love things and they say
these these this is evidence of ancient giants I love discovering this stuff and like just trying
to unravel why people still do this um let's get into if you don't mind uh let's get into
David and Goliath because Goliath seems to be this uh you know I've heard some scholars say well
no he was it's one source says this he was nine foot and another source says he was six foot
something if I'm not mistaken um can you get into this and was he considered a raffaeim or an uh
what was he and was he considered a giant yes so this is this is part of the same story
okay uh it says let me uh find the passage here
uh let's see this is in the book of joshua
okay it says in joshua chapter 11 so okay so to carry out this story the the spies
Moses sends the spies they find giants in the land
but uh Moses and and Caleb says we should go anyway because Yahweh God will defeat these
giants for us okay so we don't have to worry about them but the Israelites are still terrified
and because they're terrified to say no we won't go Moses says okay you guys are bad you can have
to spend the rest of your life wandering in the wilderness and it's going to be 40 years of wandering
before we can enter this land so the sins of the people are in listening to the spies and in
refusing to enter into this the holy land so this is their big sin is is being afraid of these giants
that's why they have to keep wandering in the wilderness so but when they finally go in Moses
dies joshua comes along and leads the Israelites into the promised land and they have all these
battles of Jericho where the walls come tumbling down notice these massive walls
again and there are ruins of uh cyclopean walls at Jericho okay to this day you can see them and
they're huge six foot long stones piled up huge and so this this again is a clue for the people
who built these massive stones uh finally joshua defeats the canaanite people but also he defeats
the giants who were there and here's here's the passage where he does this in joshua chapter 11
he says at that time joshua came and cut off the anakim from the hill country that's one of the
names of the giants from hevron he mentions hevron here from davir from anav and from all the hill
country of juda and from all the hill country of israel with their cities joshua eradicated them
so joshua eradicated all the giants here no anakim remained in the land of the children of israel
okay they're all wiped out but there's a proviso here only in gaza gath and ashdod did they remain
well gath there's still giants there okay and guess who goliath is when we meet goliath in
second samuel 21 it says uh david and his men killed four philistine giants who are the last
of these giants and it says these four were born to the rafa in gath that's rafaim that's one of
the names of the giants and they fell by the by the hand of david and the hand of his servants
so in this story in second samuel 21 david and his men kill the last of the giants in gath
okay which is where there was one of the last enclaves so all of the cities all of the giants
in israelite territory were wiped out the gath and gaza and ashdod became philistine cities
so they're outside of israelite jurisdiction so these are the last few pockets of the giants
in philistine areas so where they kill and one of these philistine giants is named goliath of gath
so he's explicitly called one of the last of these giants now the famous story about goliath
in first samuel 17 has david going against goliath single-handedly and david kills him
okay and there he's he's called goliath of gath it's the same guy and he's huge he's a giant
okay he's terrifying uh there are different uh numbers in the masteretic text and in the
septuagint and in the dead sea scrolls the dead sea scrolls we have one text that from the dead
sea scrolls that agrees with the septuagint so there's two different versions of how tall he was
okay he's either nine feet tall or i forget what the other seven feet tall something like that
but either way he's still a giant right in you know in in the shorter uh version that's in the uh
septuagint and the dead sea scrolls you know he's the size of uh a couple of guys who are in the nba
finals okay he could be a center so uh you know but but that's still pretty giant to most of us
and it would certainly be very giant to ancient israelites but if he's nine feet tall then you
know he's even taller than you know adin and and and the greek creek uh so this is this is
goliath he's the last of these uh primordial indigenous giants in the land and the glory of
defeating him goes to king david okay so he's dead too the last of the giants is dead too so
joshua killed most of them david killed the last of them this gives glory to joshua and to david
this shows that you know we're not afraid of giants we can defeat them because god is on our side
and so you know with these great mighty adversaries it shows the greatness of our own heroes let me
let me give another version of this story though in the book of amos it says that god killed all
the giants they didn't even need the israelites to kill them so the different versions of how the
giants met their end uh in amos chapter two god is speaking through the prophet amos and amos says
in god's voice it was i who destroyed the amorite before them and here amorite is is a word that
refers to the giants whose height is like the height of cedar trees whose strength is like oak
trees now cedar trees were the tallest trees in the ancient world this is these are like
these are the cedars of lebanon which are their version of our redwood trees okay so they're huge
trees massive trees so their height is like these you know cedars of lebanon and their strength is
like oak trees which are the strongest trees but i ya wed destroyed them i destroyed his fruit above
and his roots below so using the tree metaphor i destroyed them you know from the top to the bottom
and then it was i who brought you up from the land of egypt i led you in the desert for 40 years
to inherit the land of the amorite so in this little vignette in amos god completely defeated
the giants which shows how great god is that these massive fearsome giants god just crushes them like
grasshoppers uh and the israelites just march in to take their land which god gives them so in
this version in amos the israelites don't even have to go to war against them god just defeats them
himself and this is similar to what there's a kind of undertone in some of these stories
the the spy stories where where moses and joshua said i mean when moses and calib said well god
will destroy them before us so that there's some versions where the israelites don't even have to
defeat them it's most it's clearest in amos here but there's a kind of substratum in in the pentatucal
stories where god just defeats them all and the israelites just stroll in that's so this so this
shows where the goliath thing comes in and and what amos is saying and the prophets so we can we
can draw out that the story of the conquest of these giants these indigenous peoples of the land
was a widespread story and had different versions of it that we can see in these different texts
and it had everything to do with trying to explain in a sense the geographical
details which i think is fascinating it's just it really is fascinating so the landscape has these
built-in memories of the giants just like you know the great lakes is if you're you know living
there a hundred years ago those are built-in clues of paul bunion if i may if i may take
us into this you brought up an interesting point in genesis six i personally love looking at like
the different sources that maybe even genesis is drawing from we know it comes from mesopotamian
lore if you will it's possible that if you look at gilgamesh for example he seems to be a mighty
strong warrior type of person nimrod might have legendary babelonian roots in some mighty warrior
possibly a giant here they're building structures to heaven is this a ziggurat is this a you know
how did you do that right obviously these are massive images in our heads from the landscape
whether it's exaggerated or not doesn't matter the point is they're massive something beyond what
a normal civilization would build during that time or at least during the time in which these are
being written and they say there's no way that's possible but the mating of gods with or you know
somewhat elohim these divine ones mating with humans it makes me beg the question in judges
looking at samson i can't help but think there's probably alternative theories of his birth narrative
because how does this guy get born with this long hair and he's killing a thousand men with the
jawbone of an ass whether that's actually a hill they say that was called the jawbone of an ass or
an actual jawbone of an ass it just to me that birth like these abnormal characters seem to be
divine or partially divine is there something here with samson yeah i think so let me say
that it doesn't just stem from mesopotamian background but the greek background is important
too that all of these cultures were linked from in my sonnian times in the late bronze age period
in the iron age all of these regions had contact with each other they had trade relations they had
merchants going back and forth and there's a continuity of some of these traditions
so the mesopotamian to the east the greeks to the west i think you have to count both of those in
gilgamesh is a great example he he he too is essentially a demigod his mother was a goddess
his father was a king okay this is just this is like achilles his mother is a goddess his father
is a king in the uh in one of the versions of gilgamesh that we have uh that's written in ancient
hittite they give the height of gilgamesh and if i recall correctly he's something like uh
12 or 14 feet tall he's massive yeah he could sleep in king ag's bed so gilgamesh too is a
giant and he's a giant because he's a mixture of divine parentage and human parentage so this is
the same idea that we have with the nifiline they're the sons of gods are their daddies human
women are their mommies and they are giants and they're great mighty warriors as is gilgamesh
as is achilles so this there's a continuity of of traditions in the ancient world about these giants
and about gods having children with humans and so forth and creating these these super human creatures
gilgamesh's tragedy the pathos of the gilgamesh epic is that even though he's this mighty giant
and he's a mighty warrior he's a mighty king uh he's you know it says that he's two-thirds
divine one-third human now i'm not sure they had the genetics quite correct there but you know
maybe the the divine dna is stronger than the human dna but even if he's two-thirds divine
and one-third human he still has to die because he has that mortal inheritance and this is what
the gilgamesh epic is about he wants to find the the solution to death he wants to to overcome death
and the greatness of the story is of course because he's even partially mortal he can't escape death
and this is what i mean this is kind of a spoiler earlier but this is what the gilgamesh
epic is all about and what makes it such a great epic that he comes to terms with the fact that even
he the mighty gilgamesh will have to die someday now the samson story uh sounds a lot in some respects
like the story of these other giants like for example hercules in greek mythology
samson is this hugely strong guy at one point he lifts up the gates of the city in order to
escape from gaza this is one of the philistine cities remember this is one of the cities
where there were still giants according to one of these texts the text in joshua
so this is a city to lift these huge gates made of these big stones this really is a strong giant
he is like hercules okay he's also kind of dumb like hercules is okay and he keeps falling for
the wrong women like hercules does okay now interestingly samson is fighting with against
the philistines the philistines were greek peoples okay so people have suggested scholars have suggested
that maybe you know these philistines who come from the greek areas maybe they brought stories
about mighty giant warriors like hercules and then the israelites get a hold of these stories
and so they make one of their own so samson in many ways uh has a kind of feel of a kind of
hercules character i might be because of that interaction with the philistines
it's an old it's a version maybe of old greek hercules stories this is enjoyable i love talking
about this and just probing into these ideas the idea of samson being a giant being a a
mighty warrior is is clear in the narrative and a lot of people will say which came first the
chicken or the egg um using that logic to me for example the mesopotamian stories are far older
than the biblical story of creation and and genesis um it doesn't prove that the samson one
necessarily you know is older or newer i mean in younger but if you use that similar logic it's
very possible like you said that that could be the case um it doesn't really matter to me because
either way it's not well this one came first therefore this one's truer they're all legends
so whether you say that or not doesn't matter but samson's birth something really crazy happens
at his birth um his father and mother they see god and he's like i'm alive what the heck am i dead
and you know like no no no no you're alive like we're still alive i can't believe this and i think
there's some tradition there like you can't see god maybe but and live or yeah well it says that
there's a tradition that you can't they what they actually see is an angel okay okay and and it's
kind of a funny story because he you know samson's mother figures out that he's an angel but his
father can't really get it through his head that it really is an angel until the angel turns into
fire and goes up to heaven because he keeps saying join us for this meal he says i don't eat i'm an angel
he says what do you mean join us for a meal and he turns into fire and goes up so it's a it's a
marvelous story that has a kind of divine intervention in uh facilitating the birth of sam
of samson um both of his parents are humans though so that makes them a little different
from gilgamesh and makes them different from from hercules makes them different from the nifiline
but you know there's a family resemblance among these creatures and because of the divine intervention
this seems to somehow give him these superpowers it's depicted in the stories that he's dedicated
to god and he's a nazarite which means you can't cut your hair and you can't drink liquor so this
is a kind of special um religious office a kind of special kind of monk as it were not not with
the sex part but with the alcohol and the hair part uh and somehow that nazarite office is connected
with his superpowers but it's a variation on a theme i thought it was interesting too like if
you take this approach you can look in greek and other cultures and see virgin births or let me put
like this what we would call virgin births uh the god's coming down okay let's give an example
zeus well that's not virgin birth that's actually having sex with a god so yes let me let me put
it like this i think that's the point i'm i'm getting at is in the biblical narrative abraham
sarah's not able to she's barren it gives you the hint in genesis 12 she's barren hey oh no genesis
11 hey she can't have kids hint hint the narrative is going to tell you what's going to happen down
the road um but in the biblical narrative oftentimes it's a human having sex with a human
in the others there's always a god involved in this act uh which makes them somehow divine but in
the biblical they do a little change it's like uh they demythologize it seems the narrative to some
degree and say well god is the one who miraculously you know made this happen um but it still didn't
require a god having sex with a woman in order to have that happen yeah and and the you know these are
special birth stories birth stories where you know the birth wasn't going to occur naturally
and so you have divine intervention and the point is that there's different degrees and different
kinds of divine intervention uh i would add that that's not an israelite inner innovation it's not
a biblical innovation as such because we have some old canaanite stories where we have the same
sort of thing uh we have two canaanite epics one the epic of kyrta and the other the epic of akkad
and both of them begin with with uh in one of them it's a king and another one he might be a king
or he might just be kind of a prominent citizen uh but uh they're not able to have children or all
their children have been wiped out and they can't have any more children so the appeal to the god
the high god ale for a child and ale intervenes a special divine intervention and blesses them
and says now you will have a child and then they have a child okay and that child is destined for
greatness either to be the king or to be a hero or something like that so that's the that's the
specific um constellation of themes and motifs that you see in the bible in the patriarchal
stories in particular so this comes from the older canaanite heritage okay that it's not the god
having sex with the human woman to to to have this offspring but it's the god blessing the human
ability to have children and and so that that's a kind of divine intervention now let me say that
this in the canaanite stuff in one of the stories this has to do with divine ideology
i mean excuse me with with royal ideology that is to say it's the king who's barren
and can't have children and so the god facilitates him having a child but in canaanite royal ideology
the king was a kind of son of ale a son of the high god and so this sonship of the king
with the god makes a special relationship now in if you move over to egyptian kingship
the king is a god the king is the instantiation of the god horus in the flesh so it's a divine
incarnation kind of thing so i would say that these are these are variations on a theme also that
the god can be incarnated in the human or the god can sort of be a father figure to the human
and give him blessings and and those are just variants of the same general idea that that
that the gods are running the show and that the birth of the child is kind of a divine event
doctor hendall i got one more question because this is now and the birth of christ in the new
testament is develops these themes in its own way right it's part of the same longer story
i got one more and because because we can um we can do lots of little details and get into all
this stuff but genesis three comes to mind after you said genesis six when we started with these
giants and these sons of god come down from heaven these divine ones with women god curses man woman
and the serpent this serpent is obviously later interpreted as satan that great dragon etc based
on christian lore however in its original context there's always interpretations of trying to
understand what is the serpent here the serpent will have seed its seed will have enmity between the
man and the woman and itself whatever that is is it just a snake on the ground and that's it
because in the ancient world they had a weird way of taxonomy and snakes were just a bad thing and
they're like uh no bad snake no we're enemies with them or um is there some type of um lineage
going on between the giants descendants etc potentially linked to this serpent idea of a seed
and there's enmity between these divine ones children because because the serpent i understood
i think it's the what's the Hebrew word nakash i can't not yeah the it can be understood as the
resilient or the something like uh it's not just a snake sometimes michael hyzer by the way i'm not
a christian i just say i've heard him kind of interpret it this way is like this could be kind
of a seraphine like uh what what could this be yeah so let me just say i think your first explanation
is is the right one okay that it's a snake but snakes let me just say factually speaking snakes
are terrifying right snakes are really i mean particularly if you ask my wife snakes are just
evil and terrifying things and if you come upon one on the path where i ride my bike regularly
you don't want to go near it because it's a rattlesnake and it'll kill you and it rattles at
and you it's it's it's a terrifying thing so snakes are not your ordinary animal okay and
there's this enmity my wife just hates them i'm i i'm sort of intrigued by them myself but i won't
get too close um in the ancient world there was a kind of folklore around snakes that um you know
they're they're both dangerous but also sometimes they are healing remember that in the bible
moses in the in the wilderness people are getting bit by poison the snakes in the wilderness and
so he makes a staff with a with a golden snake statue of a snake on the top of it he calls it
nakhushtan from the word nakhash which is snake and holding up this staff wards off the the snake
the the danger of the snake bite um in greek mythology the the the the logo of of asclepius
this is the patron of doctors has the two snakes on it the snakes are both deadly but also in
certain certain circumstances if you use their images correctly they can be healing as well
like moses is nakhushtan now let me tell you something else about snakes
it's very common for uh cultures to regard snakes as either immortal or perpetually
youthful why is that they shed their skin now i'm in my 60s now i would love to shed my skin
and become your age be perpetually youthful right we can't do that but snakes do that
they're old snakes they shed their skin and they're young again this make and this is part of
what gives snakes their medical power that they're able to overcome death so it's a strange taxonomy
it's like uh the observer who witnesses this is kind of interpreting this to go they keep on like
renewing their age because they look fresh and clean once they get rid of old skin they're
coming they regenerate um now let me tell you let me tell you one more clue here in the gilgamesh
epic that's what i was going to get you to okay gilgamesh finally reaches the flood hero who lives
off in the corner of the cosmos who is the one person to whom the gods granted immortality
and this and the flood here it tells gilgamesh look you're stuck you're mortal i can't reproduce
those events it was a one-time deal i was in the right place at the right time and became
immortal but you can't do it so go back home but the flood hero's wife says oh given something he
came this far and so he gives gilgamesh the plant of rejuvenation and this is going to make gilgamesh
not conquer death but be able to rejuvenate but it's so hot when gilgamesh is walking back to his
boat he sees a beautiful cool little well a little pool and he goes swimming and leaves
the plant of life by the side of the pool and a snake comes by and eats it what does the snake do
the snake sheds its skin and rejuvenates and this is why snakes shed their skin and rejuvenates
and gilgamesh is so pissed off he said i came this far and i had it in my hands and the snake
took it away from me the snake robbed him of his chance of immortality now notice that that's the
same role generally speaking of the snake in the garden of eden story he robbed the people of their
chance of immortality they no longer have a chance of to eat the fruit of the tree of life
and live forever so the snake is a kind of trickster figure who tricks the humans out of their
chance at living forever it's the same motif in the similar motif in the garden of eden story
and in the gilgamesh epic and it solely has to do with this folklore understanding of the
nature of snakes i wonder if there's more than just those two in antiquity about snakes and
their rejuvenate i bet you there's more there's more particularly close let me let's let's poke
bible in this real quick because you will crawl on your belly the day the rest of your life the
days of your life okay was he not i mean some people go before that he had arms and legs and
could walk or whatever uh that's one thing they'll say and maybe you can address that number two
is the common your hill were bruised and you will crush his head is that just like the picture like
like i'm standing up now but it's like hey no get get out of here like like you're stomping the
snake's head is that all it is yeah that's what this is the middle east there's snakes all over the
place and they're gonna bite you in the heel unless you smash them in the head okay yeah that's why
you carry a big stick when you're out in the walking in the desert so you can whack the snakes
before it whacks you that's a very realistic picture of the enmity between people and snakes
oh and let me say let me say um what was the other thing you you asked walking walking with arms
and legs oh yeah yeah yeah it says now henceforth you will crawl on your belly and eat dirt
now crawling on your belly is is a gesture of servitude of servility when you bow down to the
king there's these wonderful expressions i bow down to the king i bow down to the earth seven times
seven times so bowing down on the earth and crawling on your belly this is this is shameful
servility okay and eating the dirt is the same thing so this is a severe punishment for the snake
it's forever it's going to be you know abasing itself because of this and that's what snakes do
they crawl on the ground so obviously they before they weren't crawling on the ground so they must
have legs there's a there's a picture of a snake-like creature called the mush hushu in
mesopotamian mythology and they're they're they're pictured all along the gates and procession way
of the ishtar gate the famous ishtar gate which is now in the museum in berlin and it's this big
long reptilian scary looking snake thing with legs so i think we actually have you know a pictures of
this is a kind of supernatural being but it's a snake-like being with legs which i think is what
you imagine the snake looked like before this punishment wow ladies and gentlemen i was looking
at your cover to see if this snake was here but no this is but this is a great image on the front
of your book in this book reading jenice is this where we can hear you discuss a lot more about
this whole giant thing in some sense or uh the giant thing is something i've addressed uh more
recently i have an article that just came out a few months ago about this if you go to my academia
dot edu website you can you can download my article about the giants and there's a couple
pictures in it of some of these stone dolmens and stuff well you did fantastic i have to say i
really enjoyed this show on giants and how it like relates to ancient myth ancient lore i love these
stories i just their stories though i don't buy them ontologically or epistema i don't oh this is
the truth and this literally happened i just find it really interesting to kind of peek behind the
curtain and see the magic trick that everybody believes literally historically as fundamentalist
and go oh no this is really ancient explanations for why the world looks the way it is and it acts
the way it does and why i'm afraid of that creature or whatever it might be it's just brilliant and
let me just say again the bible is much more interesting when you don't read it through a
fundamentalist lens wow ladies and gentlemen go get the book uh he's got reading genesis he's got
other books as well on amazon um i want to get that academia uh link so if you send it to me i could
put it down in the description for people to go check out your articles and follow you on academia
this is brilliant we're gonna have more coming with dr. hendall of course but this is fantastic
thank you for your time my pleasure and ladies and gentlemen if you're crawling on your belly and
you don't know your purpose come check out myth vision podcast we are myth vision
