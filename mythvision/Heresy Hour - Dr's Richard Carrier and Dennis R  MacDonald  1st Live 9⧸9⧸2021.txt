We are here now and you guys are seriously awesome thank you please forgive
me audience last night the video for those are just tuning in was accidentally
deleted I don't know into the exact doesn't what happened but there's no
way to bring it back but I have high definition really really good stuff we're
gonna have this on the patreon so real quick my friend my friend sorry Anthony
Guthrie he has a thing on slavery honestly might be better to just do it
as its own session tomorrow well we can talk about this so long as you remember
yeah I will I will he's a he's you are the director so he's huge welcome what
is up we are myth vision myth vision ladies and gentlemen Daniel is getting
that Russian vodka all right we already got some super chats baby that's what I
like to see and look I can pop it on the screen so I'm using a cool setup if
you guys saw it's so much cooler than last night when I just went through
you through YouTube secular rarity thanks for the super chat he says you make
some absolutely awesome stuff Derek thank you so much you rock on man thank
you I really appreciate the love if you have any questions I'll try and keep an
eye out on your name and ask away but thanks a lot man we're gonna jump right
into the deep end and get these people's questions so I will have to let our
you know you guys know in this I can't just like after about three to five
minutes when the chat gets pretty heavy super chats can disappear and so we
have to cut things short to make sure we can get them and not to cut things
short that's a good discipline yeah I'll just get the content out so all right
unclean hero what is up man thank you so clean hero from religion do you have any
critiques of Christ himself we just wrapped a video about that really we
did I mean that the gist of it the overarching gist is it depends on what
you mean by Christ whose depiction and whose interpretation so okay let's get
out we compared the fundamentalist literalist reading of the Bible versus
the intention of the authors version and then even that is their version of
Jesus isn't necessarily the Jesus so it's a vexed question really let's look
at the like the human ideas within the Gospels right like forget about walking
on the water so to speak but like is there any teachings you would look at
go I'll answer that question but I'm gonna answer it in two ways Derek but
very briefly okay one is I'm convinced that the mythologizing of Jesus in the
Gospels owes something to Greek poetry but in almost every case Jesus is
portrayed as either more compassionate or more powerful than the heroes of
Homer but I'm also a scholar of Q and I know there's a huge controversy about
whether there was a lost gospel Q but if there was a Q or even if not if
traditions known say to Matthew have anything to do with early Christian
tradition Jesus is portrayed as more compassionate in the use of Jewish law
and has arguments against the rich blessings for the poor oracles against
Jerusalem that kills the prophets and the Jesus of the Q document comes not to
call the righteous but sinners and even prostitutes will enter the kingdom of
God before Torah enforcers who are called Pharisees in the text and this sits
very well with what I understand the shortcomings of religion that religion
has made expectations of fidelity to and actually fleece the public in order to
fund its organizations and is not taken care of the poor and the needy and is
not been able to challenge the rich in an appropriate way and I must say that I
am a hopeless socialist and that kind of rhetoric in trying to make religion
more responsible for the less fortunate than I is very attractive to me so real
quick the super chat is Christ of the gospel he unclean hero thank you for
the super chat see he super chatted the super chat right and he's like all right
look the red letters so do you find any problems with the red letters if we can
go with that could you since you've already given your position here can you
give a I mean yeah I'll just throw out some examples I think the the extreme
hostility to human sexuality that you get from the Jesus of the red letter I
think is contrary to humanist contrary to human welfare and contrary to
humanist principles and also his extreme pacifism the total non-resistance like
don't don't even sue anyone don't even oppose the thief who sees it seals your
stuff do nothing to resist anyone who even slave enslave you actually now in
context of course that's written by people who think the world's gonna end
anytime soon so that any resistance that you pose risks sinning and thus
shutting you out of the kingdom whereas if you just like do nothing and let
anybody enslave you beat you kill you whatever for ten years let's say or
even 20 but then you get eternal life for it what's that's a pittance right
that's easy suffer through it like that's that's the attitude so it's based
on apocalypticism which I think is there's a lot of negative outcomes of
apocalypticism including failing to act like custodians of the earth for
example failing to plan for the future that that kind of stuff and then this
sort of extreme morality that comes out of it so I don't I don't truck with the
apocalypticism and you know that's different from again the literal
reading of Jesus is even worse than the intended reading of Jesus that's just
two examples I threw out there thank you appreciate the super chat unclean
hero Daniel I don't want to butcher your Russian last name bro it's a kiz i lov
kill osef kill osef I don't know is that close to see it yeah he says keep up the
good work sexy boy love you man thanks dude I appreciate you for real man tell
me if I got your name right too is it is it cuz he I know I have to see it cuz
he love I don't know if I'm saying that probably has kazalov yeah that's
pretty good that's what it sounds like you're trying to spell I can't see the
words so I don't know well I spelled it but if you saw it you're the kind of
person who needs to identify yeah I yeah if I see the the letters I know that you
yet the etymology or the phonemes but interesting all right wait thanks for
that super chat bro it also depends if it's like for example Polish versus Russian
pronunciation I think it's Russian I know he knows Russian so thank you man
appreciate the love do this priest is back back do this so the story of the
four kings that visited baby Jesus you mean three kings some people say three
kings actually it's not even there's a no number in the gossips so right so
we'll just go with his number it says the four kings that visited baby Jesus
one was turned away for bringing fruit cake what was the religious mean baby
shower no one likes fruit cake that's the way that's it's really you just got
to be literal with the text on that one no you know this is a good time to it
doesn't mean that there was actually a king and he actually brought fruit cake
it's just an allegory for the fact that no one wants fruit cakes you're supposed
to take away the lesson is the moral of the story is don't bring fruit cake when
your friends are bringing frankincense and myrrh and gold so to educate everyone
what is the purpose the actual purpose and when I say actual I mean like the
secrets what's the allegory what's really going on here the teaching of this and I
know the kings and the gifts yeah what's the point of that narrative what do you
think there's a wonderful study that has been done by one of my students on the
similarities between Matthew's account of the infancy of Jesus and speculations
about the birth of Alexander the Great and it includes astrological signs and
it includes Magi of all things and so there is in the air a fictional trope
that includes a lot of these elements that you find in in the Alexander myth
but we also know from rhetorical handbooks how one is supposed to greet
the to give an encomium or a panageric to an emperor and what you do is you talk
about how magnificent and unexpected his birth was and how he comes out of such
a good genus that a good family and that in fact the the gods shown on his birth
with astrological phenomena and that certain sages were able to and to see
in the birth of the the youngster of a future dynast and you actually have this
also in the mythologies of the birth of Augustus and you see this in
Suetonius and he's somewhat skeptical about them but nonetheless these tropes
are there the next thing is that he was wise and there was an opposition to his
birth and he shown himself to be above his peers and he grew up and became
smarter than anybody except for Richard Carrier so but we actually have
rhetorical handbooks that talk about when you are praising an emperor what
tropes do you use and one is the irony that the person comes out of a noble
heritage but does not receive proper recognition by the authorities and the
so ancient readers would see here the advent of a baby who's going to change
the world much like Augustus or much like Alexander the Great and I can show
you how these retours were taught how to tell an infancy story that's awesome
would you want to comment on that no that's spot on it just reminds me of
something we can't even remember we said something either it was today or
yesterday but it's in the vein of everything we've done I mean I tell
you my mind is messed up it's cooked from the sun tangled in knots and and
cooked by the Sun oh my gosh a pasta brain right now I'm sorry I something
relevant thanks dude this priest man you rock thanks for coming back man
Gnostic informant my good buddy everyone go subscribe to him he interviewed me not
too long ago yeah and he's a good friend of mine and he says tell Dr. Carrier I
missed the email for the class laugh out loud oh dummy he says can I jump in
still or wait till next month if you if he wants to yeah you can jump in you
could jump in man jump in because when I get back I'm still gonna continue the
class and yeah I mean it's your week behind but we're not doing anything
scheduled so you can catch up however you want awesome thank you man I
appreciate that seriously the only thing I would say is if if the so the email
will have the link okay if that link is expired he should email me so that I
know to send a new link for him but email him again if you need to if you need
to the link might still work I don't know how Google decides when to expire
these links so yeah honestly I don't I'd prefer them not to at all but but if it
has happened then you'll have to get in touch with me but otherwise the link
should still work in the email that you got the invite from the Google groups
thank you brother appreciate it all right we got some super chats guys lined up
here so hang on just a bit I'll be right back okay I'm gonna ask it out loud
will you be able to hear me yeah I'm just gonna want you're good okay yeah I'm
just washing my hands go for it okay so Michael Bottoms asks and I'm kind of
loud guys so that he can hear me too Dr. Carrier is it your belief that one
cannot hold on or hold to in a historicist position without ignoring
evidence or engaging in felicitous reasoning
sorry let me pop that up for you Michael thank you for the super chat bro I think
I'm gonna bring gifts to my children I heard that yeah and I don't know what
else for all these super chat by the way if I might this pattern of the rhetoric
for the Emperor is even clearer in the infancy narrative in Luke okay and there
we have again and well go ahead and ask your question okay Dr. Carrier is everyone
an idiot who doesn't agree with you I'm just kidding is it is it your belief
that one cannot hold to a historicist position without ignoring evidence or
engaging in felicitous reasoning well notice I already allow historicism at
least a one in three odds so for me it's a question of I he has a follow-up so
okay I apologize Michael I'm on a phone guys I am so fallible right now I'd say
like most historicists the answer is yes they have blatantly fallacious or
inaccurate premises but there are a number of historicists who have
reasonable positions the ones that have reasonable positions are the ones who
actually acknowledge that mythicism is at least plausible yeah so so we're
really hedging by like maybe a 30 or 40 percentile difference which is if you
understand how evidence works that that is an extremely small change like
normally probabilities are be like 10 100,000 times out of range but when
you're like within 30 40 50 percentiles you are so close that even just the
slightest change in the probability of evidence can actually swing you over 50
percent so so that's why like if you're if you're already at 80 percent then
you're roughly in the same range of where I am already right so it's like it
you're just like leaning in one particular direction whereas I'm leaning
in one particular other and it's difficult then to like it would be it
would be very difficult to get into the minutiae of where are we assigning that
why are we ending up on different probabilities and it often involves in
a large different database of background knowledge that we're operating off of
he follows up given that position on what errors in reasoning or
evidentiary analysis do you believe your present companions base their
positions my present companions who do they mean that's a good question let me
read you Michael I'm sorry given that position on what errors in reasoning or
evidentiary analysis do you believe your present companions base their
positions I think and I might be wrong is he saying like what do you think why
do you think the history why do you think his sources well let's for example
for Dennis McDonald and I think the the main difference is his dedication to Q
is a hypothesis and actually being able to show that that's I think is is the
problem he's assigning too high a probability to it would be very difficult
because it gets deeply into the weeds of how we interpret a wide range of
different particular pieces of evidence so so that that to me is a much more you
know it's a much more ambiguous difference it's much much harder to like
get behind why we're ending up in different places but I understand the
difference though because he once he's constructed that particular Q you can
see how he's constructing the particular historical Jesus that he wants he ends up
with but if you look at others I mean my book proving history is all about this
in chapter 5 I give example after example after example of historicists
making arguments that are completely fallacious and obviously fallacious
sometimes on blatantly false premises and most of those that agree with right
yeah so so if you want to see like blatant if you want to see like blatant
examples which which you know it's one of those cases where a few if you were to
get all these historians to suddenly stop like if you could magically wave a
wand and like it you suddenly they forget all false premises they only have true
premises and and they can't reason non-fallacious they like somehow it's
blocked there would still be some historicists left because of the
ambiguities in the evidence because it's so ambiguous the evidence is so
difficult to like parse and but they would be closer together right all the
the mythos and the historicists would only be like 50 percentiles apart right
so which is if you think about it like a single piece of evidence that is five
times more likely on one theory than another is gonna end up if you're
starting at 50-50 you're gonna end up five times and concluding probability
it's five times more not not 50 percent more right not point five difference
we're talking five difference not a point five that's a huge difference so
that that's how ambiguous and weak the evidence is for the historicity of Jesus
that you end up in this uncertain zone right it's the historicists who say
it's oh no it's a hundred to one there's a Jesus or there's a thousand to one
there's Jesus those are the ones that are making fallacious arguments okay but
of course that that issue works in both directions if there's new evidence that
doesn't work as well for mythos correct yeah then then it moves in the other
direction by the way that's why I want I want this I want someone to produce a
book defending historicity that's that's like and answers all of the
objections and problems that I point out in on the historicity of Jesus so you
can have two books on a shelf here's the best case for historicity here's the
best case against and then you can like compare them yeah I want some scholar to
do that no one's done it yet I do want everyone to know I mean I can't read
your mind but after knowing you and meeting you and talking for hours and
hours and hours yeah I know that you would it wouldn't matter if there was a
guy yeah it's not right that's the other thing is I often that's another one of
the common fallacious arguments is that I need Jesus to not exist no no no I went
for years in grad school and through most of my life completely comfortable with
the historical Jesus in fact I would love to be able to reconstruct a plausible
historical Jesus like that there's a there's a hundred different ones that
are totally plausible and they don't vindicate Christianity right so it has
nothing to do with Christianity it's not an anti-Christian thing so I have no
problem with historical and I find many historical Jesus theories to be entirely
plausible right that's why I end up with such a high odds on the margin thank you
thank you Ben Bassett thank you for the super chat hi I think he means Richard
how should academic historians best counter popular writers like Tom Holland
on topics like Christian influence on Western morals and then of course yeah
you'd like to comment that's a good question because I don't see enough
pushback that as there should be there's this most historians just ignore it
that's just pop-pop and then they don't write about it they don't not seeing
themselves as a public intellectual who needs to push back and for the public's
benefit right so that the public isn't snowed by this kind of triumphalist
narrative of Christianity how it saved Western civilization and if it wasn't
for Christianity we'd all be doomed no right and also I would think like the
ancient historians really should get in this fist fighting right because they
know all about philanthropy originating in ancient Greece and that they can talk
about like the origin of charitable organizations the origin of human rights
the idea of natural rights is like comes out of the Stoic philosophy they should
I mean these historians love ancient culture they should come up to their
defense basically but no one wants to be perceived as the the evil bad guy who's
bashing Christianity I think is and whereas I don't mind being seen that
way because you know that's what I do right the next one yeah okay Alan Alan
Bird man thank you so much once again for the super chat being a hopeless
socialist like me what does Dennis think of libertarian theology with that in
mind libertarian theology right okay all right curious that in mind what is his
favorite text mine is the magnificent you mean the Magnificat yep the
Magnificat sorry I could it's small letters on the my apologies the Magnificat
appears only in the Gospel of Luke and so it doesn't occur in the earliest
strata of traditions about Jesus in fact it comes at the end of the synoptic
tradition yeah but the Magnificat and the Benedictus both are amazing texts and
they set up Luke acts as an epic of sorts if you think of it all epics need
crises in order to sustain the narratives to the end and epics are long
complex texts and so is Luke acts so in the case of the Iliad Troy can't be
taken they're in the ninth year of the war and Apollo has punished the the
Achaian troops because of the arrogance of Agamemnon and you have to have then
some kind of intervention the intervention includes a guy named Calcas
who tells the Achaians that they have to give Agamemnon has to give up the the
daughter of I don't want to get too deep in the woods in the Odyssey the
problem is Odysseus is trapped at Circe at Calypso's Island suitors are at the
home of Odysseus Telemachus has come of age but he's not strong enough to get
rid of things and you need divine intervention so Athena goes and talks
to her father Zeus and decides he's going to go and give courage to Telemachus
which is very similar to the Holy Spirit coming to Jesus telling him he's
his god god son and empowering to claim his kingdom the Aeneid starts out with
the problem that Troy is destroyed and Aeneas and his people need to have find
a kingdom and in order to do that they need the help of the deities Luke acts
begins with the oppression of Greeks then Romans over the Jewish people and the
longing of Jewish people to have a redeemer a savior who can come to their
rescue and so the Magnificat is a political document it is not a praise of
motherhood as it's often taken at Christmas the same is true of the
Benedictus I've waited my whole lifetime for salvation and now I see it in this
infant and so on so these texts set up the epic proportions that Luke wants in
order to have a triumphal Jesus that is proclaiming a kingdom that ultimately is
going to reach to Rome and it really is a magnificent fictional narrative of the
growth of the Christian movement and it's a fictional move a document for
which I have great admiration so these I agree with the your loving the
Magnificat and the Benedictus because these are stories of liberation against
oppression and hope that and I'm an atheist but they had a hope that God
would finally rescue Israelic from its its enemies and establish a kingdom of
peace thank you appreciate it digital come ski come sky come ski apologize
Chomsky Chomsky do you know that it's not our Chomsky Chomsky you don't know
who Chomsky is never mind okay he's a contemporary philosopher so he's
Dr. Carrier peer review weeds out crankery your blogs many bold your blogs
many bold philosophy claims are not peer reviewed so how do I know it's not
crankery yeah the same way you know anything is not crankery yeah you don't
necessarily need pre-review you can you can wait until peer review has occurred
if that's what you want to do but you can also just go look at someone who
argument and weigh it yourself I mean crankery is self-identifiable like you
once you figure out a skill of identifying crankery you can do it so you
just go and engage with the argument figure it out I actually my intention
with philosophy is to make it available to the public for the public to make
their own judgment there is some philosophy that I have gotten through
peer review but generally the process is too much work for for too little gain
really because you don't get paid for that right to get it through peer review
and the peer review standards are there a lot of them are kind of I find
onerously stupid so for instance they want you to do history of philosophy
rather than the philosophy you want to do so they want like tons of citation of
every other philosophy is spoken about the subject and the huge apparatus and
stuff and I was like I don't need to do that to make my argument so what I do is
I as a public philosopher I just do philosophy and then people who want to
do philosophy can interact with my arguments as they are and then evaluate
them on their own so philosophy for me as a public enterprise isn't necessarily
an academic enterprise but I do also do academic philosophy I'll do some public
stuff and then I have things that I want I have a list of things that are half
finished papers that I want to get through peer review I just don't have
the time to do it because it's that's you know I gotta make money gotta make a
living I hope that answers your question I appreciate that thank you for the
answer thanks for the super chat digital Chomsky
mm-hmm Cade Welley I am not shy to ask this question I hope they're not shy to
answer it and thank you for the super chat if this is too vulgar then feel
free to ignore it but is there any truth that the Bible says anal sex isn't real
sex and anal is fine to do before marriage I knew this Catholic girl who
was wild no there's nothing in the Bible about that nothing at all
anywhere no I mean there's Paul has a a criticism of unnatural sex in which he's
very clearly categorizes it is wrong so but he's talking about same gender I
think is what he's trying to say well he's actually brought about it it's
unnatural section he's taught he actually mentions women in the context so so it
is possible he's referring to anal sex but I think he's referring to all unnatural
sex of any kind anal would be included oral as well right so any sex that is
used for unnatural purpose and he's definitely a sexist for procreation guy
he's not he's not a sexist for pleasure guy that's right so so there's
nowhere in the Bible I think sex is for pleasure is actually a problem even the
song of Solomon which is very erotic even it does not have an ideological
declaration that sex for pleasure is great right so interesting I'm not gonna
ask about the Greek world I already know it goes down like he would be
surprised there is a lot of prudery amongst the Greco-Roman elite but it is
not nearly to the scale of Christianity but they were not as sexually
libertine as you think I mean they they were in practice you know how everybody
like even you know the the most righteous supposedly righteous evangelical is you
know having sex snorting math and having sex with guys and stop bathroom
stalls right so so so there's there's difference between practice and preaching
right so the the actual preaching of even pagan philosophers is very
restricted but not restrictive but very they're not very pro-sexual
libertinism that is not that is not the environment interesting question thank
you for the answer and thank you for the super chat Cade pony no more says how
can we tell when the Gospels got their traditional authors assigned to them
thank you for the super chat oh that is a wonderful question and I'd like to to
address it nice I think some of the Gospels at a relatively early time did
have attestations or attributions to Jesus's followers and I would say that
Luke is was somehow in the title but it's a late a synoptic Gospel and
certainly the Gospel of John was identified with the beloved disciple at
some point I don't think it was in the earliest version but I think it might have
been in the second version
but Mark and Matthew are a different story and our earliest witness to this is
Papius who's writing around the year 110 and he already knows that there's a
Gospel that's attributed to Mark but it and and I and a alleged eye witness
testimony from Peter Peter preached in Aramaic Mark translated in the
Greek and but Peter preached in random order and that's why Mark has a
different sequence that's what papius says papius says but papius also knows of
two Gospels of Matthew potentially more than that only one Gospel of Matthew
survives because those two Gospels of Matthew disagreed in sequence and were
apparently longer than Mark papius and his informant apparently John the elder
attributed both of them to flawed a as flow view them as flawed Greek
translations of Matthew's Aramaic original now if we look at the Gospels
they do not carry originally the names of those Apostles so why is it that
we have those names attached to them I think Mark by the way is a Latin name
it's not even a Greek name and it is a very common standard Roman first name
Marcus and it is secondary because it is simply transcribing the preaching of
Peter Matthew on the other hand was one of the twelve already in the 12th
Matthew on the other hand was one of the 12 already in Matthew and Mark in the
Matthews we have and so he's an authentic eyewitness and then you have these
two translators both of whom botched it up and papius says he's going to want to
put it correctly so Matthew's name gets added to these Gospels because he's one
of the 12 and so his witness is more direct than it is in Mark who's simply
recording tradition and he's doing the best he could papius says he did a damn
fine job but it's not as good as what would have been in the original Matthew
like why you're saying this there's so many like funny things in my head about
how this literature was fine like he's keeping the tradition yeah what do you
mean he's writing a literary fiction here but I love how they paint it though
well so the Matthew becomes more important than Mark because he's one of
the 12 right and so then you have this attributed to them now the Q document
probably in my view is the other Matthew and it may have been attributed to
Matthew as well at least papius thought that they were coming from the same
transition tradition but I want to go quickly to the beginning of Luke Luke
ignores he knows Matthew but the name Matthew only appears in lists of
disciples he is not a bearer of tradition there's no recognition of use of
Matthew Matthew has a very very little influence on the ax of the apostles for
example he's he's really vanished there is a John Mark who's an informant not
only to the Jerusalem church but also to Paul so he's a more authentic bearer
of tradition and he's called a who paratase that is an assistant at the
beginning of the gospel the God Luke says he knows lots of people have
created the aces that is expositions of the things that have happened and he's
consulted them all and they are they involve eyewitness testimony think
Matthew and Peter but also who paratai those who are assistants of the logos of
the word knows papius is traditional idea correct yeah that's a position yes
very interesting and that mark is who paratase that is he's a transmitter of
the petrine tradition and he if Peter goes to mark John Mark's house in the
acts of the apostles and then becomes a who paratase also to Paul he's the more
authentic transmitter of tradition and what do we find in the synoptics Luke is
much more dependent on mark than he is on math yeah so there is this really
clever use of names now by the time Luke writes he knows the Gospels have
been attributed to people in the Jesus circle Luke also by the way is a Latin
name Lucas and and what was I going to say and he's a part of the Pauline
tradition so now you have a Pauline gospel but it has he's done his research
with earlier books and he has John Mark as an informant as a who paratay of the
word it's really quite clever thank you so much
no where man what's up thanks for the super chat he says I'm back with another
dumb question what is the mimesis origin of Jesus bringing Lazarus back to life
in John 11 oh in John okay you want to start I have a section on that in on the
history of Jesus and I had come to a realization about it my on my own and
then found a few other scholars had actually come to it actually several
have when I did my research for it I discovered others had figured it out too
I think what I mean what's going on there I think is John is reifying the
parable in Luke and he's doing it to criticize Luke so Luke Luke is of
course it that's the first time we ever hear of a Lazarus which is interesting
because Lazarus Eleazar is actually a really common Jewish name and we have
no examples of it appearing anywhere in the Gospels or acts except for this one
particular instance where we have the parable in Luke and then we have the
suddenly it becomes history in John in Luke of course he says you know Lazarus
is the beggar who's at the it's a parable it's not even true right so it's not
even a historical fact that Jesus is telling this as a tale to illustrate the
gospel and this is you know that there was this Lazarus who's this beggar this
rich guy kept ignoring him and kept ignoring him and didn't help him do
anything for him and then the rich guy dies of course and then the first Lazarus
dies you know and then the rich guy dies and then the rich guy's down in hell
burning horribly and he's desperate for any like even a drop of water and he
sees Lazarus up in heaven you know this is very convenient for a story that you
can do this so he sees Lazarus up in heaven in the bosom of Abraham you're
resting in the bosom of Abraham in paradise and you see he reaches out to
Lazarus and he says please you know put in a good word for me give me just a
drop of water and the the response is like you had the you had the you or no
he also says he says that but he also says when he's rejected he says okay
well in that case would you send send Lazarus back to go tell my brothers that
you know what's really gonna happen so that they know and this they don't end
up where I am yeah and they the response is like they have the they have the
prophets they have the scriptures they should know and if they don't know do
right yeah so yeah John doesn't like this and you know John if you read
throughout John always the final redaction of John so there's many
recensions of John and it's been edited over time so I'm speaking of the final
version like when this got into John is a whole other separate question but by
the version that we have now there's John is repeatedly talking about signs and
evidence and this is what proves this and so he's very concerned with evidence
can convince you and in fact even when it comes to Lazarus at the end of the
story of Lazarus he says the resurrection of Lazarus was the thing that
was convincing people to come to Jesus and that was the thing that initiated
the Sanhedrin to desire the you know the elite to decide we got to get rid of
this guy we got to kill him so so that's evidence is that important so in John
in John that's that he's using this to do the opposite of what Luke says Luke
says Lazarus isn't gonna come back so it's almost a parable for saying why
doesn't God send people to like explain this to us and he says he already has the
prophets so it's an argument for why why someone isn't being risen from the
dead to like prove this whereas John says no Jesus frickin rose Lazarus from the
dead and Lazarus convinced everybody to come to Jesus and so you should come to
Jesus too it's the exact opposite message right so John is reversing it the
entire point of the parable by creating a real historical story that will
convince you okay so before we get your mimesis I really want to know mimesis so
we'll strictly go to the witcher mimesis is ladies and gentlemen who are
watching if you super chat and for whatever reason I miss it help me out
bear with me because I have a limitation on this and these guys can't just oh
two-minute answer it's impossible for some of us longer than a lot more
complex so forgive me I am absolutely trying to maintain and get everyone
super chats please okay I agree with much of what Richard said about this
text and I think the author does know the story of Lazarus from the synoptic
from Luke but I think that there's another fascinating tradition literary
tradition that lies behind it ultimately I think he's building on right this is
compatible but yeah I think it is and but I think it comes out of Euripides
Bacchai Dionysus is put in a prison there are women in the chorus who are
outside weeping he is freed from the from the prison and he's freed from the
prison and then the women rejoice and so on this story in the Bacchai had already
been imitated in the Acts of the Apostles with Paul's prison break right yeah at
Philippi and what happens there there's a woman named Lydia from Lydia the chorus
in the Bacchai are the Lydian women then Paul and Silas are put in prison
there's a convenient earthquake as there is in the Bacchai the women then
rejoice and and there's hospitality now in my synopsis of mimetic synopsis of
the Gospels I lay this out in more detail but this is in my view is an
example of eclectic mimesis on the one hand there's a a engagement with the
story of Lazarus in the book in Luke and in fact it's not exactly in my
reading what Richard says because the Jews still don't believe in Jesus when
even though they see that Lazarus has come back to do but the public do it
says there that's they're worried about the fact that many are coming that's
right so there's a but the elite still don't believe yeah but then you have
also these possible echoes to the Bacchai now these parallels by themselves
may not be convincing but when you see the evidence of the Bacchai on the
Gospel of John generally generally that he's the the heavenly stranger who
turns water into wine and tells people to eat his flesh and drink his blood
these are all Dionysian and they were recognized to be such an antiquity in
that case this story appears in the earliest stratum of the Gospel of John
apparently and isn't a later insertion so maybe that's two minutes no that that's
more than two minutes but wonderful and if that antithetical rants thank you for
the super chat what do you make of the research by Brian it's actually Brian
see metadescu or more rescue and the spiked wine with psychedelics of the
illusian cult and early church so he wrote a book it's really an
immortality keys that where we're talking about yeah I mean I think it's
largely crank yeah it's no it's not it's not peer-reviewed scholarship so it's
not really a usable work of scholarship on the subject there is a ton of usable
scholarship on this is proper peer-reviewed science and stuff I have a
then in on the history of Jesus I have element 15 right I actually cite a lot
of the scholarship on this there's a huge variety of ways that people can
experience altered states of consciousness and full-on hallucination
that don't involve psychedelics in fact a human the human brain is actually
naturally designed to do to get into hallucinatory states and there's a lot
of literature on this it's in the anthropological field and sociology and
so on and psychology and cognitive science so so you don't you don't
actually need recourse to psychedelics psychedelics did exist and people did
use them but there's no evidence of that as a channel for hallucination in
early Christianity there's none there's evidence for sleep deprivation there's
evidence for ritual chanting to create altered states of consciousness there's
evidence for schizotypal personalities but there's no evidence of anyone using
substances as an enhancer for this and they didn't need to it culturally
throughout the world it's not necessary do you have a take on this I haven't
read the book but I've emailed back and forth with him I thought the argument
had more to do with the use of hallucinogens in religious ritual not
necessarily Christianity sys no but why I didn't elusive as well you have the
Dionysian cults otherwise so the Delphic oracle would be an unknown example
so yeah so we do know that hallucinogens were used in rituals in ancient the
ancient world including in Judaism by the way so the fact that you have wine in
the the Christian Eucharist it's not that it's a hallucinogen but it may be an
altered spiritual state that is evoked yeah it's an enhancer for being able to
reach altered states of consciousness same as you know all the other methods
that you can do so to that extent I think it's useful that's all thank you thank
you appreciate the super chat Yaga yo thank you for the super chat why is
Matthew put first in the synoptic gospel so I think he's saying out of all the
Gospels how that happened yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna agree I'm gonna answer that in
Greek the first words in Matthew are the book of Genesis of Jesus Christ it's
sometimes translated as the genealogy and so on it evokes the beginning of the
Pentateuch and then what do you find immediately in Matthew is a genealogy
that goes back to Abraham and so if you're looking at the beginning of the
Gospels for something that hooks it up into the biblical the the canons already
developing related to the Septuagint say having a gospel that says in the
beginning and then begins with the genealogy is a dead ringer I think
that's a completely plausible thank you for that super chat black belt monkey
song thank you for the super chat is it is it possible I think it means that at
all to come up with a recreation of the passion of Romulus oh a recreation of
it a recreation of the I mean not a complete one obviously right so but we
have a lot of pieces that we could put together I think that probably Richard
Miller's book probably has and all the pieces in it so Dennis's student Richard
Miller put it put out a book is it resurrection and tradition or I don't
remember honestly yeah so it's resurrection and tradition Richard
Miller you can find it it's a proper peer-reviewed academic book he goes into
all sorts of like ascension narrative traditions and empty tomb traditions and
so on and throughout pagan culture but he his main central focus is Romulus so
he does so you'll find everything every possible reference to the passion of
Romulus you'll find cited in Richard and the most important one is Livy
because then Livy informs some of the later historians yeah of course I mean
it's more important that Plutarch references the fact that there were
public passion plays and the one thing that we really wish we had is Ovid's
Fausti in that section because Ovid's Fausti is missing the six months that
has the Romulus passion play in it we would love to have that because it means
you would have a whole section poetically describing the passion play of
Romulus we would love to have that I mean I often and I mentioned in my book I
suspect the reason we don't have those six months of Ovid's Fausti is it was
too offensive that that was too similar to the passion of Jesus can't prove that
but it is suspicious in a pile of other suspicious omissions and ancient
literature thank you Alan Bird now we're I'm trying to catch up I don't know if
I missed something super chat I hope I did not I swear on everything you guys
are coming in quick on me so I might do like this and that just means like speed
it up yeah just because I want to make sure everybody do what we can Alan Bird
says Richard Paul's infamous 500 eyewitness texts refer to the Apostles
and also to the 12 what do you think he meant by these terms yeah I mean there's
what I think and then there's what we can prove right so those are two different
things I mean if you were to take the text as written and assume that's what
Paul wrote and I have a blog on this and the 500 you know I have a blog on the
500 I think it's more like I think that's a reference to what Luke mythologizes
in the Pentecost ecstasy I think that's that's I think Luke is creating that
environment for that but I think originally if you were to ask what I
what I suspect actually happened I don't think Paul wrote to more than 500
brethren I think he wrote to the brethren at Pentecost because Paul later in
that same chapter refers to Jesus as the first fruits of the general
resurrection and Luke puts the first public announcement of the gospel on
Pentecost so I suspect that there was the origin the religion actually began
that way at Pentecost they grave had this great experience that they decided
was convincing them that the religion was true and that's when they began
preaching the gospel publicly so I think he just said brethren I don't think he
said 500 brethren and if you look at that you know Luke is using the epistles
of Paul if Paul had said at the time that Luke was reading it 500 brethren Luke
would have put that in there instead he says 120 which is a symbolic number it's
10 times the 12 tribes right so Luke just puts 120 sort of an arbitrary
number that he just comes up with so I suspect that it originally said and by
the way 500 and Pentecost in Greek look very similar so it's an easy scribal
mistake to screw one up to the other so I suspect that's what happened and that
would tie into Paul's later reference to the resurrection as the first fruits but
I can't prove that right it's just it's one of those things that a boy it looks
suspicious but either way it was some sort of mass ecstasy it wasn't a it wasn't
Jesus showing up and having dinner with them it was some some sort of magnificent
experience like feeling Christ inside you or seeing a light in the sky or
something ambiguous that they interpreted as a confirmation that this is
Jesus appearing to us verifying the gospel I don't think I think it was a
more generic experience that they took as very meaningful and not not with the
gospels portray thank you skip Bosco says if contemporaneous evidence for the
existence of Jesus was discovered in what form or forms would it likely appear
and thank you for the super chat skip I have a good answer that what do you have
good all right I've mentioned this many times the library of Herculaneum is
still there it's sitting it's all the scrolls are charred they're sitting under
you know 500 feet of ash we started excavating it in the late 19th century
and gave up because we didn't have the technology to recover the scrolls from
that state we now have that technology and there are people talking about it we
could go back in and recover it then they reburied it by the way so the library
is still there we know the owners got away with some of the scrolls because when
the ash fall was coming down on Herculaneum they started evacuating the
library and this is a private rich man's library they started evacuating it and
there was a staging area in the courtyard and so the library is deeper in so
they had a staging area and probably got away in the wagon with some scrolls we
don't know but the staging area they eventually gave up and just skedaddled
and we've just excavated to the staging area where they were starting to pile
scrolls in the middle of the courtyard so there's a not only are those scrolls
still there but there's a whole library inside there somewhere and this is 79 AD
Herculaneum it's across the bay for where plenty the young plenty the elder
commanded the naval fleet and he died actually trying to rescue people from
Vesuvius during this event famously and plenty the elders also famous for
writing histories and we don't and Tacitus for example relied on the
history of plenty the elder and plenty the elder wrote a history as an eyewitness
of several imperial dynasties including Earth's imperial reigns
including Nero plenty was there during the 64 fire burning of Rome so there
would be a detailed eyewitness account of what happened after the fire of Rome
so there's two possibilities now I've argued that I think some certain other
sect of Messianic Jews were punished for the fire and I think the line about
Tiberius and stuff is an interpolation and Tacitus but I could be wrong about
that and if I'm wrong about that that would suggest the most likely source
that Tacitus is using for Jesus is plenty the elders history and this would
be someone in 64 detailing who these Christians were and therefore he would
have access to eyewitnesses into more this would be one of the most reliable
testimonies you would have to a from a third party right outside right to to the
origins of Christianity so you could have plenty the elder like giving you
much more verifying evidence that oh yeah there was this Jesus guy and he was a
big problem we hated this guy and then probably got rid of him so you could
theoretically have a very a solid confirmation of the historicity of Jesus
and theoretically I suspect that's not what you're gonna find in the book but
the book very likely is there because this is Herculaneum a rich guy with
plenty the elders famous he's right across the bay like the odds that this is
in there are high so Dennis I want you to answer but also we're getting a lot of
people saying that your volume is low and it's not your volume you're super
soft it's they can't hear through that no that's not it I'm recording so
ladies and gentlemen they have clip on mics but let me show everybody what's
going on here so all right you guys this is what our audio recording high
definition you're only getting 720 pixels through so everything you see here
will come up on my patreon later in super high quality including the audio
recording audio but here's the thing I do want to try and get closer because I
don't expect you to yell you your soft spoken period and so I don't we've been
talking for days and days so let me do this turn this try to get closer I mean
barely getting you both squeezed in the screen and you don't you don't have gain
control on that audio no this is purely through now the internet and fingers
crossed this works so please forgive me all right okay I'll try to talk louder
why are you yelling my my answer is entirely different I don't think we
have to wait to find the recipe of the magic sauce so we can imitate burgers
treatment I think we have all the evidence we need the problem is that we
don't have sufficient methodologies that are fine-tuned and disciplined in
order to mine the Gospels for the materials we already have and my work
for the last 10 years has been in large measure to refine that methodology so
that we can excavate the Gospels behind the mythological levels which
certainly are there and find not what I would call bedrock but we can find
early earlier constructions of the tell or of the site because we have better
excavation tools and this is not the place to talk about the esoteric tools
historical tools that are necessary I think we have all the materials we need
but I don't think we have all the methodologies we need for proper
excavation so that would be if pressed I could tell you what I think some of
those criteria are and they are not the ones that Richard Currier has
criticized in the past which which have flaws with which I would agree your
methods I actually have a section improving history where I actually
validate the methodology I'm not as confident the methodology will get us
the information that we want so that's that's where I'm on that alright so we
adjusted the audio your long lost pal thanks for the super chat just to get my
attention literally to let me know the audio was low alright in yeah my friend
says is it true that the Bible has been preserved so well only 1% of the
original verses we were talking about that earlier yeah with no theological
changes at all love you bro or love you both yeah already 1% is still a really
shitty signal by the way so if you have you know we were talking about 80 to a
hundred verses let me restart this real quick here yeah I can actually get this
on video right I'm restarting it cuz you guys on the page right I'm restarting
it cuz you guys on the patron are gonna see this later you're gonna thank you
Derek this continues this continues the same file is that what's going on all
right that's it yeah so the question is is it true that one person only 1% that
is only 1% error in the transmission of the New Testament the 1% is kind of
speciously derived because there's 1% of what verses books words letters so so
what your metric is is gonna change that percentage and also what you count as
an error is gonna change that so that there's some books on this like the
airman did a debate on this that was actually pretty good that he actually
represented the statistics pretty well in it that the correct that I mean it's
it's a questionable statistic but let's assume that it's true one 1% is only
lost or is is signal distorted right that's still a lot that's too much to use
the Bible as a reliable source and I it'll come up in a video that we recorded
earlier but if that was instructions for a rocket I wouldn't get on that rocket
like that if 1% 1% error rate and in all of our instructions for building it
now that's terrible and also like you can have if 80 verses that's about 80
verses 1% if 80 verses say something that are false compared to what the
original said that's a catastrophic loss in terms of trying to accurately
reconstruct things so it is a problem but this is a common problem in history we
fully accept that this is the case so we're used to poor signals on manuscript
transmission we don't go around claiming that this stuff isn't completely
infallible and nurse are we're absolutely certain that everything in it is true so
so that's one side of that debate but again it depends on like what what do
you care about which what it what are you counting what what do you need to be
true in it and even then that 1% figure in even as far as you can calculate it
only gets us back to the second century edition that's exactly right so important
that's really the most important thing is that David Trubes shows us this in the
first edition of the New Testament that all the manuscripts we have come from
this one common edition that was edited together and and published together as a
sort of anti-marshinite response any editing that that editor did to the
originals we have no manuscript evidence to check but none there's no
manuscript that goes back to anything prior to that so we have nothing that
goes back to the originals really we only have this addition that's a big
problem I mean that that that really limits your if your intention is to do
it the religious people want to do it for historians it's annoying but it
doesn't completely destroy our craft because we can deal with probabilities
and and accept ambiguities but but yeah the trying to use that as a Christian
apologetic is catastrophic very briefly you have the same thing with the
Homeric epics the Homeric are written in the 7th century BCE they become
standardized in the 3rd century BCE and we know that those philologians had
multiple copies that differed from each other that have not endured yeah then
you have what's a kind of vulgate of yes of the Homeric epics after which
time the text becomes incredibly stable so the same thing likely happened with
the New Testament that you had variants that no longer are able to be
identified because you had a kind of a Greek vulgate that I know that sounds
crazy of say the Pauline letters in a four gospel collection and after that
time where you had that philological precision and putting these things
together and making them authoritative then the tradition becomes somewhat
more stable we have some survivals of readings from an earlier time but they
really are relatively modest so that the stability of the text is really a
second-century phenomenon and not probably a first-century phenomenon yeah
wow there's a lot more we can go on and off in that but yeah that's spot on but
yeah it gets worse and worse than that but Jay Crone says what's your take on
Paul was he real if so what was his goal wow that's a broad question I know
people ask this of me a lot because I know there's some myth is this you try
to deny the historicity of Paul I have an article on it you can check my blog
the why do we think Paul exists the historicity of Paul you can check that
out and as to why I think it's it's an improbable it's not an impossible
hypothesis it's just a very improbable hypothesis that Paul didn't exist and
his goal was as he states he wants to spread the gospel I think he agrees with
the moral social message of Christianity or he came to agree with the moral
social message of Christianity and realized to sell it he has to sell the
gospel right well if somebody wanted to create a Paul they did a pretty bad job
this is actually that's a summary of some arguments I make yeah exactly like
like a real inventor of Paul would have done different things is to put it in a
more charitable way there were different things and then has been done so thank
you so much for the answer thanks Jay for the super chat I appreciate you bro
digital champ Chomsky is back and he says I have no idea if pH is crank actually
proving history I assume it's okay proving history is peer-reviewed actually
my contract with Prometheus books I insisted that they not publish it unless
they get it peer-reviewed by a professor of mathematics and a professor of
biblical studies so it had two peer reviewers and so it's actually
peer-reviewed work okay he says I have no idea if proving history is crank how
many top Bayesian scholars and philosophy logic math probability theory say that
proving history is serious at least five big names I they have to read it first
right so they can't have an opinion on it they can't have a valid opinion on it
they haven't read it I think there's an insistence on avoiding it largely
because Bayesian epistemologists aren't engaging with history as a field there's
some exceptions like Tucker for example and these are Tucker actually agrees with
the fundamental theory of proving history that history is Bayesian and he's a
philosopher of history is his field and there's Wallach did a did a peer-reviewed
study of the transition from old in Old Testament studies from kind of kind of
like believing the Exodus story versus Canaanite origins theory which is now
the mainstream view that the whole exodus is made up that was a huge shift in
biblical studies where now the main the mainstream is the Moses story the
Exodus story is all myth and the Jews were actually just Canaanites that were
native to the region and just conquered the locally and he did a Bayesian
analysis and showed how Bayes theorem explains why the the actual field of
biblical studies shifted and that's a peer-reviewed study and I actually have
an article on it on my blog so people who are paying attention are actually
doing this and actually involved in this and in proving history itself I cite
archaeologists in peer-reviewed literature are using Bayes theorem and
approving it for the study of history through archaeology I think the problem
is it's mostly being ignored because historians are afraid of math they
don't they they're terrified of the idea that anything they're doing might be
mathematical and that they have to learn math they shouldn't be but this is an
American disease largely the way our schools teach math make people hate
math and fear it rather than be excited about it and and find how valuable and
useful it is so that's a problem so I think there needs to be more attention
to Bayesian especially because history is all about probability so if your entire
field is based on probability arguments you really need to understand the
logic of probability and if it's not Bayes theorem you need something else so
that's that's one of the points I make is like if you're gonna reject this you
got to replace it with something so what's your replacement right so so that
that's my response on that but but it's important to note that proving history is
actually a peer-reviewed work so it's it's not just some random self-published
thing real quick guys and audience forgive me it read because we don't go
quick enough and stuff I get it I lost I think three maybe four of your guys's
super chats it's throw the question back in not super chat it can at me at
mid-vision I'll keep an eye on there you go at someone let me know that these
are actual super chats because if your question super chat had a question and
it hasn't been answered yet do it at Derek I don't know what you're the next
one I see right so if your super chat was before your long lost pal here on the
super chat try to get it to me and I'll keep going down hitting the super chats
because it updates on those actually show to anyone right everybody sees their
super chats right huh I should just go in there and go in there and see if it
pops up and we'll look before your long lost pal and and and go on YouTube but
while you do that I'm gonna ask some questions what do you make of the
apologetic against adoption of pagan motifs like dying and rising gods who
did a video on this by the way for example Jews didn't adopt pagan
traditions is what they'll say so I'll let you I'd love to have you start with
this dying and rising God and like the Jews wouldn't use pagan tradition that
is really unfortunately an ignorant question and I don't want to insult the
viewer because I'm so grateful she's asking cuz some other Christians are
saying that I suspect is what we have so much evidence of a cultural
assimilation of Jews into the Greco-Roman world that in fact almost all forms of
Judaism have some form of Hellenism in the first in the first century and I
can give examples in third Maccabees you have imitations of the Bacchae in fourth
Maccabees you have imitations of Greek poetry in Tobit you have imitations of
the of the Odyssey you have it also in the testament of Abraham phylo sites
Plato over and over again for insights into his exegesis of of the Bible
Josephus interrupts his narrative of the the Jewish tradition in the
antiquities and embellishes it with imitations of the elite and the Odyssey
to think that we have a Judaism in the first century BCE to the second century
CE that is insulated from Greek influence is really unfortunately on
an uneducated judgment wow and that goes for dying and rising God motifs I
suspect oh it goes it's hard to know it's hard to know what it what is exempt
wow well said thank you your long lost pal I'm gonna continue as if nothing
happened and see if we can't pull up like a YouTube link or something and see
what I missed okay I'm in I can see it now okay before your long lost pal can
you see the chat and go up yeah I can't all right what's before that okay well
that's a question so let's see you see Cade Welley so we have I'm not there might
be others up up further but the one that I caught up to now is what do you make of
the apologetic against adoption of pagan motifs like dying and rising you just
did that one yep so scroll oh I see you want further up cut you off huh but you
go back there and don't miss any you don't want to miss anything that have
come since then I'm just trying to make it won't let me go further up I made
wellies next and she's the orange super chat I do have one other question but
when we have time okay so Cade thank you so much I love asking this question to
experts so let me ask are there any literal jokes in the Bible or is there
anything that looks like it could have been a joke but the nuance has been lost
in translation or lost due to time I don't think we have jokes as a genre in
the New Testament but that doesn't mean we don't have comedy in the New
Testament and there's a difference and it's there we also certainly have
witticisms that a reader can enjoy while reading one of my favorites is the
story of a euticus in the Acts of the Apostles who is listening to the Apostle
preach in the preaching is so boring he falls out of a window and dies and his
soul stays in him Paul says oh don't worry his soul still in him I'm gonna go
back and preach and at breakfast I'll leave they leave and they take him up
and his name is lucky well help yeah euticus well come on this is the el
pain or of the Odyssey and that itself is kind of a funny story so I think we
need to be alert by the way the difference between tragedy and comedy is
only that the in a tragedy things end badly and in a comedy they end
positively and when Mark calls his gospel good news he's announcing from the
outset that it's a comedy and not a tragedy thank you appreciate that I
think you guys will both agree on that one Cade you rock thank you so much for
the super chat Antonia Miranda thank you for the super chat says could
Christianity have been manufactured in the second century since all texts come
from Egypt is there an attestation of Jesus in the first century well we don't
know all texts come from Egypt that's not any evidence of that particularly and
the could have is a possibility question so anything's possible it's not
probable the evidence seems pretty strong that these texts originating many of
these texts originate in the first century awesome awesome alright alright
thank you and Tony I hope that answered your question there not sure if it's
satisfied your well you know we could do a catalog of probable texts that attest
to a Christian movement in that earlier period and I would include the John in
Epistles and Papias which is an extra biblical text and the the social
identification of things of a movement that comes right after the Jewish war so
I think one could make a catalog of evidence that really is quite long and
indisputable do this priest I'm noticing I missed yours he says so why did Luke
miss the boat on the story of Jesus walking on water because it's so
outrageous and it's it's so obviously dependent on epic he already has Jesus
coming the storm in the earlier period and this happens in a what's called the
larger omission in Luke where there's a large section of Mark that is missing in
Luke because he wants to avoid duplication this story is largely a
duplication of these stilling of the storm they feel the feeding of the 4000
also is missing in Luke and it's largely a duplication of the feeding of the
5000 we have other examples of duplications so Luke has a big project
he's got the X the Apostles to go for and by the way the limitations on how big a
papyrus can be for consumption in antiquity is a kind of a physical
limitation on how some long some texts can be now people can put together other
choirs in a codex or they can add papyri to a scroll but even so there are some
physical limitations and also it becomes boring if you think he had
imitations of mark in that section again duplicating this this work it really is
a diversion from his literary task right yeah and we talked about that how they
would do their own creativity thanks for that super chat in though I missed
yours as well so I'm catching up and I'm gonna get to the current ones
question was why don't other Jesus text like Gnostic text like the Gospel of Judas
taken seriously historically Judas was written only 40 to 50 years after John was written
well I think we all have a historical probability criteria and when we run it by the
the Gospel of Judas it doesn't meet the criteria very comfortably as to why we
don't date it earlier is that the question or take it more seriously I think oh take it
yeah it's only 40 to 50 years after John was written so why aren't we taking the Gnostic text
yeah well that's that's the sorrates paradox right as you keep adding a grain it's a hill
it's a hill you keep adding a grain at some point it comes a mountain but but every time
it's still a hill when does it become a mountain why does one grain make a difference
between a mountain and a hill so if you keep pushing it out well it's only 50 years after
this well it's only 50 years after that well it's only 50 it's only 50 years but yeah but it's like
now we're like 150 years after the beginning it's still half a century right interesting it's also
still half a century it's a good question to kind of get the point yeah yeah yeah but is it also
it's a bit of a sorrates paradox though there's some of the stuff in it a little outrageous I'm
gonna back up so I can make sure I can get both of you in the screen because you guys are hanging
barely in the screen over here oh my gosh okay do we have a super chat or can I interrupt or
do we need something do we have to do now did you want to say something no no I okay I no I just
I want to jump in when there's room um so I'm communicating with a friend of mine who's also
in watching and and and you had misread a question from someone else earlier that didn't make any sense
and so it was about libertarian theology is what you said right and so I don't know what that's a
reference to um no it was so this is a paraphrase this isn't the exact but this is a paraphrase of
what the question was supposed to be I think um since you're a dirty socialist like me what do you
think of liberation theology and what is your favorite liberation text and then mine is but
he doesn't remember he doesn't remember what the one that he said but uh there's a big oh the
magnificat that was it yeah so liberation theology and you did kind of touch on that a little bit
yeah so okay Gnostic informant super chat thank you Alexander romance miracle birth son of god
knows his death fulfills prophecies dies in the month of april at pascal moon at almost exactly
33 years and he's got the little hole in his chin like what do you guys think sorry I was
Alexander romance miracle birth oh god knows his death fulfills prophecy dies in the month of April
at pascal moon almost exactly 33 years oh well I mentioned before the similarities between the
birth of Alexander and the birth of Jesus and the gospel of Matthew and um the importance of the
Alexander romance has less to do with um direct mimesis one way or another but it shows that
people were perfectly willing to mythologize historical characters yeah and to do so according
to certain rhetorical tropes that are going to appear also in some of the lives of the emperors
so um this is a very interesting um um alternative text the other thing is
that people say that luke mark couldn't be sophisticated because his uh greek is mundane
well take a look at the alexander romance um it is not a sophisticated greek it really is
rather pedestrian and yet it's a very sophisticated and fascinating mythologizing narrative so it
shows that this kind of composition in the ancient world to venerate heroes uh was common but attempts
have been made to make um um more literary connections between the alexander romance and
by the way the alexander romance appears in several versions so it's not just one thing
that is it it has several recensions and they sometimes differ from each other but quite apart
from that it's hard to draw a direct literary line between them but you can draw a rhetorical
mimetic line between them interesting thank you did you want did you have anything to add on that
no all right so this was the earlier question alan bird asked thanks alan for the super chat man
i'm catching up everybody i'm catching up my earlier question to richard was
why does paul refer to the 12 and also to the apostles in the 500 witness text are they not the
same okay that that is that is a whole different question right so because this gets to the question
of is verse seven even original like like because it seems like attack on yeah why are you saying
but especially isn't just throwing james in there that's that seems like so random uh like what is
the purpose of that uh so i i mean i personally suspect that that's an interpolation i don't
think james i don't think paul wrote the and james and all the other apostles and last of all to me
i think he just said and last of all to me but um but it's possible that paul wrote that uh and and
if he did it clearly indicates that there were more apostles as obviously paul is an example
apollos would be another example than the 12 the 12 were just the original quorum the original
council of 12 who represent the 12 tribes who who whom peter it convinces to endorse him his
his new mission uh and then there are others who have the vision and these are the more there are
more apostles than 12 even the gospels say there are more apostles than the 12 um i mean they claim
70 i mean i'm sure that's just an arbitrary sort of theologically significant number i don't
doubt there was actually 70 um but i obviously you can tell from paul that there are more apostles
than the 12 um but we can't really get back at the actual what was going on at the beginning
as to how many apostles there were how were they becoming apostles who was endorsing them could
any of them have been excommunicated was that possible uh you know paul's talking about christians
being made anathema for preaching the wrong kind of jesus uh so there's so much that we have
tantalizing hints of that we don't have actual good on the ground intel about what's actually
going around going on at the time i think you have a friend who really wants to get your attention
digital chomsky chomsky yes this is what number all caps philosopher math math um think mathematician
probability theory scholars so he's talking oh i see under work proving history what number uh
well i i mentioned some so you can go to my blog and look for uh the wallach article uh that's an
example of it uh you can look for the tuckers book uh on uh historical knowledge uh is making the same
point um what i'm counting oh yeah two uh so those are the two and then of course the peer reviewer
the mathematician wow both peer reviewers my both peer reviewers for that uh so um who who obviously
buy you know double blind method have to be uh anonymous but still um so those are the ones that
i know uh the rest all comes to like who's going to read it get get one of these guys to read it
and then comment on it critique you yeah yeah hey you're you're open you wanted to happen
mark smith thank you for the super chat how important was ending infant circumcision as a
motivation in writing the new testament also if you don't mind controversy i'd like to hear your
personal view on whether it should be legal whether what should be legal circumcision circumcision
oh i see i see right that's a complicated subject ending infant circumcision as a motivation in
writing the new testament yeah i i actually i wouldn't object to outlawing it um without unless
you have a specific religious objection like make make people actually declare it as a religious
thing rather than just do it as automatic uh custom um there's a there's an important distinction
to make here so if you look at female genital mutilation for example there's actually three
levels of it uh there's the the hardcore like removal of the clitoris which is like horrific
mutilation and that would be the equivalent of cutting the top of the penis off altogether uh
and then there's uh trimming of the labia like hardcore trimming of the labia which is closer
to male circumcision and then there's ritual just pricking like like a slight removal of something
just to claim that you remove something that's very trivial um at all of that's pointless there's
we shouldn't be doing any of that stuff but uh with regard to male circumcision removing the
foreskin is unnecessary and excessive but it is not as severe as the the worst form of female
genital mutilation which is literally that would be removing the glands of the penis which is
basically just completely removing the sexually sensitive part of the penis all together that
would be horrific mutilation by comparison to so it's not it's it's more ambiguous right so male
circumcision is more ambiguous than uh the thing that people talk about is the most horrific version
of it that said I still don't think we should be doing it uh and and I think there should be more
we should be forcing people to make a religious objection positively uh to do it so technically
and I don't know if you'd agree with this a Jew who's proclaiming this is their ritual and their
practice and their religion and they're born that way you're not objecting to that what that
bothers me uh that bothers me but I don't think morally they should do it uh but in terms of
maintaining a civil society I think that is a that is a place where we don't really have to force
that issue uh in order to maintain a civil society I would argue I would argue persuasively to try
and get rid of that tradition over time uh but using force to stop it I think would cause more
problems than uh than letting it happen I think it's a superb superb answer but I would say that
from the perspective of social identity theory what happens with male circumcision is that
identity in the community is determined by a male right and not a right that's for women as well
and I'm not endorsing female circumcision so it it by itself it is a gender discriminating
you know uh uh operation and what do we do with the non-binary understanding of gender
sexuality right and so we've got a factor that in but there's something else male circumcision
is a way of having a high boundary maintenance between the Jewish community and its neighbors
which is imposed on children before they have a decision about whether they want to be in that
community voluntarily right and then they are marked for themselves as members of this community
and not to another and I think that there are I agree with Richard that we should not be imposing
a abolition at this point of male circumcision but I would hope that the Jewish community would
rethink its way of understanding its social identity in a in a community in a world that has
non-binary gender thinking and more fluid social boundaries interesting yeah thank you for that
Christianity considered thank you for the super chat I missed your earlier one you said and you
said thoughts on Herman Dettering's arguments for thinking that all of Paul's letters were written
in the second century I apologize I really couldn't control what happened so anyway gentlemen oh well
I have a blog article on that that's the historicity of Paul it addresses that not to the satisfaction
of deterring fans but nonetheless I think his theory depends on an extremely elaborate system of
epicycles this this extremely elaborate theory of interpolations in the letters of Paul and a
bunch of other hypotheses that that don't have evidence on top I think it's too elaborate hypothesis
for with too little evidence for it and unnecessary yeah so that that's my conclusion not not to the
point I mean to point out his work is very interesting and I like a lot of his commentary but
the theory doesn't hold up it in terms of probability analysis there's just not enough
there to make it probable all right thank you for answering that so you have an article pretending
unclean hero super chatty said Jesus was a historical figure I was just reading that real
person based on all standards for determining historicity how do you feel about that Richard
I know he's talking to you um and then we'll all standards that's the that's the primary question
what standards are we talking about and what premises are we plugging into this so that
that's what my book is about uh on the historicity of Jesus uh proving history that book is about
the standards are the standards being applied in Jesus studies even standards that historians use
there's a lot of standards that are used in Jesus studies that are not they're kind of made up just
for the Jesus studies field and some that are legitimate that are actually are used outside
the field but they're misapplied they're misused in the Jesus studies field and that's what chapter
five of proving history shows uh is that they're using the methodology wrong and some of their
methods are kind of made up uh and in on the historicity of Jesus I try to come up with his
most objectively vettable method possible uh that bypasses all of those questions so that you
can just go right at it uh and so you can actually evaluate does it hold up or not and if not like
how do you change the probabilities what would you what probabilities would you make different
in my assignments of probability and why and I and why and I think that breaks it down much
more simply so that you can actually get at what is the actual question we're trying to answer here
so that that's actually what the book is for so on the historicity of Jesus is the one to go to
and take it seriously like when you get to the ends of each chapter and I assess probabilities
like ask yourself should I should a different probability be there and if so why and that's
the way to go about it that's the way we would react to this and maybe come out come out with a book
that would actually come up with better probabilities and convince me that they're right I would love
to see that so and then Dennis you are a historic historicist and they say and just repeat it again
Jesus was a historical figure and a real person based on all standards for determining historicity
how do you feel about that well it depends what you mean by all standards yeah how you manage them
you don't have to have all standards satisfied you need to have a few that you create enough
probability that you would say there's a historical character as opposed to a mythological one
and I think in that in that case Richard and I differ a great deal because I think there is ample
evidence for a historical figure but it doesn't satisfy all the criteria that people have tried
to apply to the historical Jesus nor does it satisfy all the historicists who want a particular
Jesus to come out of the analysis yeah that's right and the Jesus that I think is most reliable
is the one that can be demonstrated by what's called reverse priority in the synoptic gospels
where later gospels have preserved earlier tradition that creates a corpus that's really
very interesting it is not Christian it is Jewish for Jews who think Jesus is pretty cool
and it gets used by Christians because with this mythology of the the suffering savior and so on
there is in Christ and so on Jesus would be shocked to have read the gospel of Mark if I'm right
yeah that does and so I'm a storeroast who is skeptical of the the Jesus of the synoptics
but with the proper tools again I think one can excavate beyond the mythologies and find enough
evidence for historical Jesus that said I don't think we have can have confidence
of any one saying that comes from Jesus but we have a posture and a presence and a
memory to some extent of a character who is really so different from the the gospel Jesus
that it probably comes from historical character thank you two different people two different
positions um the mythic life thank you for the super chat hi it's christin hood hi hi christin
welcome christin thank you for the super chat where do you think christianity would be without the
jewish war oh god jewish wars sorry plural I mean true that that actually also is true so there's
multiple jewish wars um wow that is a that's a challenging counterfactual actually and contrary
to a lot of historians who hate counterfactual history I think counterfactual history is an
important way of trying to understand actual history you can't really understand your causal
theories if you don't understand how if causes were different outcomes would be different
I think historians sometimes fail at that understanding um but that one's a tough one
to actually think about let me take a swipe at it yeah mark is the first person to have a full
blown narrative of the life of Jesus and he's writing in the aftermath of the jewish war
and he's identifying the cause of the jewish war with the inability of israel to accept the
teachings of jesus in order to create a narrative of jesus's death the author appeals to the death
of hector at the end of the iliad whose death anticipates the fall of a great city and he's a
young person who dies uh unceremoniously Achilles gloats over his corpse when he kills it three
women lead in the laments watching from afar a father named uh priam has to rescue hector
from Achilles and bring him back for burial Jesus is um mourned by three women who watch from afar
a man named joseph may be the same name of his father rescues the corpse but the difference is
that jesus rises from the dead with hope whereas hector is buried and the reader knows that Jesus
would um that trey would fall now if that's the case without the jewish war you may not have a
narrative of the death of jesus and that is pretty fundamental to the christian understanding
and so i actually think the uh the jewish war was the social political catalyst that made mark
pursue the iliad as a model for the death of a hero before the fall of the city
yeah that's that's a good example of how it could have had an impact i i'm undecided i'm not really
i think it's more it would be more important to have taken paul away than the jewish war like if
paul didn't do his thing i think christianity would have faded away and it would have been gone
it would probably wouldn't even show up in our accident sources i would suspect uh by now um
can i play a scenario and see what you guys think of it while in the vein of this question
because she's part of some of my facebook groups and really a brilliant mind on so many things she's
trying to think you know and yeah and uh there's nothing wrong with that um let's suppose the
jerusalem war did not happen in 70 the temple did not fall therefore the jerusalem church
is still in power yeah do you think paul was just so persuasive and so
aggressive that he would have i don't think that's the way to put it it's not that paul was so
aggressive it's that he had a wider selling product right so like if your market is jews you've
got a cap on how many people you can convert and most of them aren't going to convert right most
jews are going to stick with traditional judaism so your your your market saturation is extremely
low it's a tiny percentage of the population and then you're done that's it that's as far as you're
going to go uh you would just be like the 13th sect of judaism in order of of interest right
um and so there's all these like lists of jewish sex and there's like a ton of them but
christianity would just be a really minor one way way way down there um
but paul made it easy for gentiles to convert and made it attract and it was already there were
attractions judaism already had to to gentiles so his church could grow much more quickly
just because of the idea that he allowed it to happen and he got the Jerusalem church on board
with letting it happen so that uh it would just grow of its own right so it wasn't really dependent
on paul's charisma necessarily uh it was dependent on paul like convincing the Jerusalem church to
endorse it and thus allow it to uh foster and grow uh but it was just the popularity of the
religion became just like any other religion that was becoming popular it would grow at the
same rate as Mormonism and other religions that we know throughout history um so so i wouldn't see
the jewish war necessarily accelerating or stopping that so i can't see it necessarily as having an
effect but denis makes a good point like if the war hadn't happened there's certain transformations
in the religion into the sort of visceral historicist narrative it's like king arthur it's the difference
between would there have been a movement for the unification of england without a king arthur legend
uh i don't know actually right because that was very central to like getting people on board with
fighting wars to unify england and create a quote a quote united kingdom right okay i want to take
swipe at this again yeah very quickly i definitely do um i'm going to jump to some super chats here
in a second go ahead and take a swipe and then i want to mention i want to ask one more question
in the vein of this if you don't know well the jewish war also caused a diaspora right uh christians
who were not a part of the pauline circle one thinks of the johannin tradition for example
the author of the apocalypse of the apocalypse the growth of the syrian church probably is uh
having you you have refugees from the jewish war you also have an enduring paranoia about
roman power so i think the impact of the the truth the the jewish war is really quite profound
yeah those are good points yes or no this is my personal i'm undecided i really don't know
here's the question though it's a different one is do you think there was a split
from the uh the well okay paul finally said here well here's another big important difference
is the rise of anti-semitism in the christian church the jewish war did have a lot to do with
that exactly uh so so so you could think of the whole future course all the way up to the holocaust
you could tie that back to the jewish war really i mean not through a deliberate like not intentionally
but i mean just through the there's a genetic stream there right right the pool ball's bouncing
that's what happened basically tragic as it is well thank you for that super chat christ and
i appreciate it mark smith says thank you for the uh for the answer to my question about circumcision
but i was also wondering about the new testament authors did they seem to care very much about
circumcision it's the question yeah okay the answer is no not for jews the issue is whether the
gentiles needed to be circumcised to be eaten with and so it has to do with social identity
merging and it's quite clear that paul is okay i am circumcised among the circumcised i'm
uncircumcised among the uncircumcised it's this right that divides the potential community from
its growth and cohesiveness so there's no objection to circumcision if jews wish to do it and paul
himself is circumcised and is not apologetic about it but to make it a requirement for gentiles
is hardly something that you want as a as a banner for evangelism yeah yeah i mean if people aren't
aware like the the universal practice of circumcision that happens now is actually a very very recent
phenomenon in human history that's not like the default we're going to circumcise all babies that
that i don't remember when that started but it's not much older than 100 or 150 years that's right
yeah interesting it's a social identity marker just trying to make sure we got you guys clearly
because the phone light it picks up makes you brighter this thing's auto so don't matter all
right well i'm going to screw you up because i'm going to go to the restroom but i'll be right back
all right all right so um i'll ask the question out loud thanks mark for that super chat read between
the lines um he says what would it look like if the maccabees had lost um
i think there's still
that's a another trick question i think the processes of hellenization
would um continue one way or the other although the the victory of the maccabees
would have slowed that but i don't think it would have slowed it very much in fact the
books of the maccabees also have imitations of greek literature so even when you are happy
about the maccabean uh successes it didn't halt hellenization much well okay it makes me wonder
too i mean do you think if they would have lost what do you think the jews would have thought
apocalyptic wise i think it played a huge role didn't it in the way that they were viewing
things apocalyptic like we're going to get the national god's going to come and the end is
gonna happen all of this stuff well i don't think i'm qualified to talk about it sorry yeah no
wait non-carrier no no biggie i'll uh ask his here in just a second what would happen if maccabees
had lost another counterfactual another counterfactual i know uh well that's a that's a tough one
actually um if the maccabees had lost good lord uh because that that affects a lot of history um
including you're good including the progress of the roman empire right because they would
be fighting different people and they'd have different allies in the region uh come the
time when they start taking over the east uh so that that's one where i'd have to sit down and
start looking at the i would have to go reading the military historians uh the modern contemporary
historians about the roman conquest of the east and how how much uh jewish alliance with the romans
actually which actually happened uh would have affected that or versus the slukids being totally
in control uh and uh being stronger therefore and therefore more able to resist rome uh i can't
off the fly uh answer the question so that was my answer yeah i'm not qualified um digital chomsky
your best friend has a question a giant scholar panel to say if crank carrier is crank i don't
even know what that means what is a giant scholar panel i don't know i don't know um obviously he's
not a fan of mythicism yeah i guess so i get it uh well it's interesting uh i think that's the same
person who said peer review is what establishes you're not a crank right it's my book on the
historicity of jesus is a peer reviewed book by a respectable uh academic publisher in biblical
studies so um so by his own standards i'm not a crank and uh he should change his question
direction i guess interesting read between the lines super chatted i you didn't have any um any
question or any comment i appreciate the super chat my friend i really do um yeah i don't see any
follow-ups on that and i hope i haven't missed anybody i really really did not i don't think
you've missed anybody since last i got on yeah and i think i missed only two but it might have been
three that i we had already answered those particular questions i'm looking for the colored ones and
making sure you don't miss any and you've done all right so far so good i'm trying i mean it's tough
on the phone yeah it's hard i can see um so i i mean as a as a guest usually i turn this off
the chat because i can't keep up and i'm not i'm not i can't keep up with the chat as is
yeah super chat at least makes it possible but um yeah because usually it's too distracting i can't
pay attention to what i'm doing it's it's hard work uh you're doing a job man a job of work
i'm not only doing that i'm having to make sure after 30 i restart these i'm making sure the
lighting's halfway oh my god every 30 minutes right every 30 minutes i'm restarting both of
these the lights right making sure you guys the super chats are getting in yeah man you're rocking
it you're both in the shot right up in the audio i've got a baby screaming in the background
no it's fantastic here it's it's it's a work it's it's excellent watching you make it happen
yeah i'm trying man i'm trying yeah i appreciate it um no nobody else let me see anyone else you
guys are more than welcome to ask it seems like look every time i do a live i don't want to block
people but it's like if you're gonna come into the chat and you're just gonna troll like i've seen
this happen with uh otangelo he comes in he's like an apologist who's on repeat it doesn't matter
the topic he comes in and he's like there's a first mover and you're like i'm talking about
ancient Rome and like orgy's in the in the pagan temples or something and you're talking about
there's a first mover and you know it and it's like that's so weird yeah hijack the chat the behavior
of some people is is odd yeah so there's another guy who comes in and it's all islam and it's muslim
and muhammad and allah's the truth and it's like look oh i see fascinating yeah you see what i'm
saying so i don't want to block people but like engage in the conversation or go to another channel
there's this question about israel oh we just got a couple super chats yeah i'm just saying like i'm
trying to look and i'm thinking to myself like it's like you have to be heard because you have to
defend what you think so true so so much that you it doesn't it doesn't look like they're super
chatting you though so they do not put in their money i have they're not contributing why would
they want to give to a guy like me well that's that's that's the always thing that i would say
like if if it's not even worth five dollars to you why is it worth even five seconds to me
and you know what when we get done with this live another live somewhere else that has nothing
to do with islam or muhammad he's and then it's like up in there and then if they do the five
dollars thing then it's like the joke you told earlier about put put call him a saint in your
hey i'll tell that if you want after i get these super chats do this pretty super chat i would do
it the same way i would you'll get an answer it won't be the answer you want but uh for the five
dollars i'll do it hey you want us to talk about islam or muhammad a super chat question all right
so we have a queue here yeah so the name israel does it have anything to do with the gods raw and
l i.e. is raw l and i've actually heard this before okay no no that's a quick that that's easy
the l is correct right because it's it's he who struggles with god right is that the yeah so it's
l l like a law it's just a word for god right it's not a name necessarily it's just means god
so israel is one who struggles with god but okay well i i would really there's no raw in there
there's no egyptian that's right stop stop it yeah okay i cannot even begin i know min
minhotep i hope i think that's right min i'm in hope it i'm in hope it i can't even begin i'm so
sorry i don't know hold on i'll wait wait i can actually i can actually come over here and see
kwami mat yeah kwami mat raw oh mayot uh so kwami mayot raw nayami min men to hotep
is uh the therapeutes jews and alexandria praying to syrapus and the syrapus called
influenced christianity and did the jews support the romans over greek okay this this actually
conflates two different sources um the work we have on the therapeutic doesn't mention them
worshiping syrapus that's not in there that's right uh there is there is a book that way way later
it's part of the uh augusta um the historia augusta which is this bizarre late fourth century
collection of biographies of roman emperors and it's the later roman emperors like the third century
and fourth century and half of them are semi authentic they're like hack jobs but they're
semi authentic and then the other half someone just like phoned it in and they literally just
started making shit up uh and so the other half they're just completely fabricated with
makeup names and all kinds of stuff it's one of the weird mysteries of history is like why did
someone finish out this collection with this complete like like is this if someone hired them
to do this and then they got tired of researching it and just said i'm just gonna make shit up
just gonna make shit up for the rest of them uh and in one of them they do there is a reference
that somehow connects christianity with syrapus and stuff but this source is so late and so bogus
and so unreliable that uh and and probably anti christian uh it's probably not written by the
christian to begin with uh that you can't use it as history unfortunately so the connection with
syrapus and the christians is just not a usable source um but the therapeutic did the influence
christianity is a more interesting question because the therapeutic do appear to predate
the christians they look similar to christians in the way they're described in phylo phylo
is the one who describes them admirably uh admiringly i should say um and usibius himself
mis tries to represent them as christians he's like oh phylo just got confused these are actually
christians and and he's actually describing christians uh that's not the case either um
my answer to that is that they're way out in egypt it's unlikely there's influence uh
they're more likely cousins in the same way you have like the early fringe sex and you have the
dead sea sect comes out of that and christianity come out of that and the therapeutic maybe come
out of that so they they may have connections ancestry and ideas and you know descendants and
ideas but uh i don't think that therapeutic became the christians or anything like that but i think
there's another possible connection and yes the jews did support the romans against the greeks
and you know therapeutic in greek means the healers and there's a literary genre in antiquity
called the polythei that is idealizations of of social groups that are used to support certain
kinds of virtues the best known ones appear in um the in plateaus republic um at the end where you
find um the the guardians are the ones in athens who um can have they don't have they have everything
in common the including wives um they they are wise governors of the city if the city had such
guardians uh athens would be in much better uh place and so we have these communal ideals and
idealizations that then get historicized so we have josephus doing the same thing with the
scenes in saying that the the kumranites have a kind of uh the communist community the therapeutic
is another example but we have also stoic examples of uh a therapy of a polythei and
one of my students did actually a dissertation on this topic to show that the republic of plateau
generated mimetic imitations in um a Hellenistic literature among jews and christians and that's
what's going on in the acts of the apostles when the church is identified as having no need and in
fact um my student has shown that in fact there are literary echoes directly from the republic
in what luke is doing in so the genre of of phylo about the therapeutic and the genre of what
josephus is doing with the scenes is a part of a literary project spun out of plateaus republic
that also for which um luke also is a contributor thank you thank you um i don't even know how to
pronounce your name my friend but satan has moved your mic too low carrier so the mic in his solar
plexus region what does that mean it's set there specifically that's why isn't here i mean you could
go up yeah you don't have to go too far because i don't want distortion but yeah i can always edit
and bump it up the high quality camera later when you guys see this you'll you'll appreciate i could
i could like make it into a nipple ring and put it up higher than the nipple ring thing
that might get some people that we don't want in the chat out of there who knows
oh lord oh my gosh
i guess i should say nipple clamp but we're gonna be crazy accurate to terminology in terms of
things like this but okay i'm gonna have look this is the thing if i block them right he says
blocking me because i say the truth smiley of course yeah the truth sucks nope that's what they
always say hello to those who refuse it it's like this proves i'm right this proves that the truth
of islam is true because i want to block a troll who can't let it go i don't know yeah yeah not
happening anyway tyler thank you so much why did christians get so involved in proselytizing
this is a good question i read um i read uh what is her name leading paul and judaism thinker um
gosh all the pagans apostle she recently wrote pay my son no um i can't believe i can't think
paul the pagan apostle you said paul the pagans apostle gosh i don't know all right of course
nope no gosh there's a lot of really great women uh experts it's fredrickson yep paul fredrickson
i read another great scholar in the field yeah she goes into the history of like proselytizing
i haven't read that book so i don't know anything about it checking out um but she talks about how
like proselytizing was like almost a new thing on the scene you don't really see that in history
where like there's competition going on now christians are showing up and they're doing things
and jews are having to compete now and yeah sure i mean you have to remember like the christianity
began as just a jewish movement right they're not they're proselytizing jews they're not and as all
the sex did all the sex were like trying to get people on their side to build political power and
influence and numbers right they and that's if you look at like uh when prophecy fails the whole
cognitive dissonance theory the idea of people evangelize the psychology of this is that the
way you can convince yourself that you're right that's right is to convince other people to agree
with you right so people are psychologically motivated to evangelize everybody is a flat
flat earthers or psychologically motivated the dude that you had to kick out is a perfect example
psychologically motivated to convert other people like this is humans are like this is how if you
have especially the crazier the belief the more motivated you are this guy right the more motivated
you are to convert people right and so there's that you get this sort of equilibrium between
craziness of belief and motivation so if it's too crazy you don't succeed in converting people
but it has to be crazy enough to motivate you to keep trying to convert people but not so crazy
that people don't convert and so you end up with this this this the draw the graph and you have the
nexus then that's where almost all religions are right so I mean obviously I mean I I laugh at it
but that's that's actually that's actually what's going on um but what happens is there's originally
a Jewish sect when Paul and so it's in context you have to understand they're already Gentiles
who are fascinated by Judaism there are things that they found very appealing about Judaism
but it was too onerous right all the requirements were too onerous so they would just hover around
the they would orbit around it right basically and but Paul came up with a way to get all those
customers in right he made the the entry fee lower and so they're all right racing in and so now of
course it's popular and you think there's those two motivations one is you could say money you know
the old motivation of churches in general but I think also I think Paul genuinely believes in
the social moral program I think he genuinely believes that this this religion he thinks this
religion will solve all the world's problems this tension this battle that results in actual
violence between Gentiles and Jews can be solved if we can all come together on this one thing
let's so if he can unite the two sides he can fix all the world's problems I think he genuinely
thinks that that's the case and I think a lot of evangelists that's also one of their motivations
that they think that they're actually helping they think this is going to solve the world and won't
people just listen before I kick this guy from being able to comment he can watch right I just
it gets annoying when you do that literally you do it oh yeah he's he's taking he's sucking air out
of the room this happens I gotta start getting some people that I've seen for a while I actually
start to be able to guard the comment section on my videos because if you're talking in the
vein of the topic and it's not relevant you're literally distracting from people watching your
content that's annoying but what he did right before I ended up kicking him and I don't even know
he might have commented a lot of stuff below that I didn't see yeah but he said um it's a hard pill
to swallow he said but once you swallow it you're set free now notice something here unless you come
to his conclusion if not screw you you're wrong and it's like yeah and they're not gonna stop till
you get it yeah you have to swallow their pill and that's he really said it's a tough pill to swallow
the one he's he has to that's he has to test it psychologically yeah the more people he can convince
the more certain confident he'll be that he's right which relates to what we were talking about
another video about uh insecurity right so insecurity drives a lot of what we complain about in religion
uh dogmatism and and trying to force other people to adhere to certain ways of thinking
and evangelism also is it is born of insecurity that's that is literally a cognitive dissonance model
of evangelism that you get in when prophecy fails that particular book uh it is this insecurity and
you solve the insecurity by reassuring yourself and the way you can reassure yourself is getting
other people to agree with you and that that's one effect of insecurity and now there is trying to
force people to behave certain ways that uh yeah I think that those of sociological impulses are
there but I wouldn't want to um put all of the texts that encourage missionizing right into a
single pattern correct yeah because their message is different from time to time yeah and their
reasons their motives their motives are different and so for example if I again go back to the Q
document just because I think it's so enlightening is I think it's there but it people can just consider
the possibility in the Q document Jesus is a prophet and above all a teacher he's called a
didosclos and his followers are not called believers they're called mahti that is they are
disciples they are his students literally and in fact there is no evidence that Jesus's followers
were called mahti prior to the Q document Paul never uses the term it doesn't appear in the
johannin tradition uh until you have some influence from the synoptics right now in this case
these people are to imitate the didosclos and his message in proclamation of the kingdom of god
in going in groups of two to teach and to heal and so on now I think the impulse of the sociological
impulse is there you want people to agree with you which reconfirms your vision but in this case
the vision has to do with an alternative understanding of Judaism it's not just that we want you to be
like us it's that we want Judaism to change so that it's more bearable to people who can't
observe Torah so sometimes evangelism can be and this sounds crazy for an atheist to say maybe
sometimes evangelism has legitimate social positive function yeah I mean the analogy is
environmentalism or feminism or any of these movements that are the social justice movement
it is a social justice movement in its own sense and that motivates people we want to fix society
we think this is what I was talking about with Paul he thinks this will fix all kinds of social
problems so yeah thank you uh mr monster says are there any correlations between Caesar
Caesar I think you mean Caesar Cesar Borgia Cesar Borgia Borgia that's a famous
pope from a famous Italian family from I think it's Italian I know I don't know enough about it
it's not my field I'm assuming this has something to do with maybe some sort of Jesus dynasty reasoning
I'm not really like uh did someone claim that he was a descendant of Jesus at some point I don't
know I don't know the context of this and that's the monster tech this is like 15th century stuff
so I don't know me I'd be interested just to hear what the whole claim is and uh if there's people
out there who think that thank you man thanks for that super chat Travis Adam says oh I'm already in
the chat do you know who that is no Travis you are in the trap look you are in the Travis Adams
you you are in the chat thank you you're in here man you're in the chat no
I don't know what's going on there but I'm being an idiot I'm being an idiot okay all right do you
want more wine or do you want some yeah no I'd like some oh I'll scotch you'd prefer scotch yeah
okay guys I'm trying to find you I uh Darren Wright let me pop you up on the screen man Derek love
the work you are doing thank you so much keep on rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling
yeah I just added a little in there thank you Darren appreciate it man look um I'm lucky these
guys even want me around them see I did a little proselytizing myself but I had things to offer
and and it wasn't a hard pill to swallow you see I had good friendship I had things in common
I wasn't too aggressive
was that too aggressive no I don't even know I can't even comprehend what you would think would
be aggressive but okay I know right thanks Darren appreciate the love man the positive uh you know
encouragement um the name that I cannot uh even represent properly here uh thank you for the super
chat Kwame Matranayame it is a long name yes it's an amazing name I just wish I knew it's Egyptian
but yeah the classical Egyptian name um majority of Alexandria was Jews and the cult of Alexandria
was Serapis we have evidence of Jews praying to Serapis at Delos and the Hadrian reference
okay wait the Hadrian reference that's a weird segue I'm not seeing it on my screen okay it's
toward the bottom or is it above J Crone is it the next one's J Crone okay I'm it's not in my field
yet feed yet uh I don't know the answer to that I don't know what to do with that question majority
of Alexandria was Jews and the no the majority that's not true uh the majority of the population
of Alexandria was not Jewish right there was a large Jewish quarter there probably the largest of
all the diaspora communities um and it was very influential and uh involved in a lot of political
tensions that the emperors had to deal with but um not it wasn't the majority of the population
that's not their question though so that's not a helpful answer the next comment is the the cult
of Alexandria was Serapis we have evidence of Jews praying to Serapis Serapis was a cult in
Alexandria there were tons of cults um Serapis did arise it was invented as a deity in Alexandria
centuries before that was centuries before though but um but it was remained popular it was essentially
the Egyptian I should say the Hellenistic Roman Egyptian version of Asclepius uh in Alexandria but
Jews praying to Serapis at Delos and the Hadrian reference yeah that that's all stuff that comes
from the history of Augusta I'm pretty sure that comes from the history of Augusta it's not a
reliable source it's very late and it's not a reliable source interesting okay okay so we're
going to Jay Krohn super chat says biggest fan mid-vision is home for me keep up the good work
Jay swallowed the big pill already see I love it love it Jay it wasn't a big pill to swallow at all
as buzz as buzz says right above you it was the blue pill the red pill or the blue pill I'm
going to say it's the blue pill man Jay seriously thanks for the super chat the love the mauve pill
everybody should take the mauve pill cheers my friends oh yeah all right cheers to the pills that
we swallow all right oh that was lovely I love that that was uh music to my ears thank you for
the friendship my friends I really appreciate it now I'm scrolling down so coffee zealot is in the
house and super chat it wow someone likes coffee when you're gonna jab at Hinduism I have discussed
with you that's funny you should ask that uh I actually have a blog on that really so there's
an interesting story uh Mira Nanda who's a uh major critic of Hindu nationalism uh the Indian
author uh and I remember how like she was just kind of like like a fan or a reader of mine and
she asked it like would you do a review of my book are you interested and I'm like yeah super
interested this is a book about Hindu nationalism because I don't know anything about that and I
would love to read a book by an expert by someone who actually knows that so I have some insider
knowledge I would love to do that it'd be amazing please send me your book and she did and I wrote
a whole blog about about her book Mira Nanda's book um I want to say like it's the god market
or the god industry or something like that I remember you'll find it on my blog if you go Mira Nanda
or just Hindu nationalism that'll be easier to remember search that on my blog Richard Carrier
dot info look for Hindu nationalism I have all article on it it was very fascinating and very
informative and it has really uh altered and improved my understanding of uh events that are
going on in India because I keep my eye on world events I read news around the world uh and so my
understanding of the politics and the situation in India is much more informed uh by having read
her book and so I would say that would if you want to hear about Hindu nationalism the problems with
Hinduism uh that's that is a book to read so this is what he said I have discussed with few
Hindus and their level of stupidity is just mind-blowing you'd be surprised now I want to
go to vouch for people who think he's bullying or whatever that's no I I I need to name a guy's
name but I haven't let's put a different spin on that let's let's say um Hinduism is very much
rooted in its cultural support in a way that this kind of unfathomable to us today because we're so
used to being able to rebel and leave family traditions or come out with their own religious
traditions so Hinduism doesn't have the build-up of history of experience with apologetics right
so if you look run into any run of the mill Christian you're going to say oh my god they're
so stupid but really it's just that they'd have no skills or experience in trying to defend their
faith once it's challenged uh and but then you can find sophisticated Christians who are super used
to this and have built on a whole tradition of getting used to this and that looks so much
more sophisticated but because it's so much more informed and it's based on experience with trying
to defend their faith against opposition Hinduism doesn't evangelize outside of Hinduism so it
doesn't has never built this tradition of Hindu apologetics right so and and honestly the same
thing can be said largely for Islam because Islam has become so dependent on political for compulsion
into a belief that it has and it's like a hundred years behind Christianity in its apologetic
technology if you think of it in those terms so like to give you an example if you were to read
creationist apologetics from the 1920s like from the scopes trial era and you read creationist apologetics
in the Islamic world today it looks very similar it's very unsophisticated compared to creationist
apologetics today because they've had to fight against people debunking them and arguing against
them for decades and decades and so they've refined their methods whereas that that kind of pushback
is either illegal or oppressed or not available in the Islamic world so the Islamic world has
kind of stunted in their apologetics because they don't they've not had that kind of back pressure
and even when they get back pressure it's not intellectual back pressure it's just cultural
opposition and bigotry right so the so even when they get opposition it's just hatred of Muslims
not constructive like actual criticism of their religion that they have to respond to
much less decades and decades of building up with this so they've built up an industry
to respond to it the way the Christians have done uh so I think like Hinduism that Hinduism
you know further back in that and so that that's why if you it's not stupidity that you're running
into it's just that they're not used to pushback against their religion and I think also Hindu
religion has not gone through cultural revolutions in the same way as western religions or even
Islam in China right so for example there's no real equivalent to the enlightenment in
Hindu tradition there's they've been affected by the industrial revolution but second hand
because of their external forces to western culture that's right colonialism and so on
so actually Hinduism is has continuities with ancient religion probably more than any other
major religion in the world because it hasn't had those major it is the most thriving contemporary
paganism that exists that's exactly right if you can imagine if Italy had stayed Romano-pagonic
right it would be it would be the same situation right but no other culture and Christianity
Christianity and Islam has crushed paganism everywhere else so it's not that they're stupid
but they're committed to a culture that hasn't had the challenges of other cultures and so it
really tends to be a very conservative and preservative social phenomenon and that's why you
get a lot of these political tensions in India now between Islam Muslims and that's right within
and Sikhs by the way too and other there's Jains and other there's many other religions and they're
more minority than that but the the hostility is not intellectual it's it's violent and political
and bigotry based between Hindus and Muslims they're not really having they're not building an
experience of critique between their religions because that's not where they're going culturally
unfortunately and assimilation is very difficult so it's social identity with high boundary markers
yeah right yeah yeah thanks for the super chat man so no one knows how Christianity got to Africa
then huh wait what wait is this the same person not the guy who this is someone else yeah no one
knows I don't even know what that's a reference to uh no it's right next to Israel literally you just
well literally on the trade route my my I wouldn't wouldn't be surprised that this is a copped or
someone who understands Coptic tradition asking the question and cops are very insistent that the
holy family got to Egypt and that there were cults related to Jesus in Egypt at a very early time
and then there is the acts of Mark that claims that Mark was a evangelist who went and faced
opposition in martyrdom in Alexandria so you have uh your churches to Mark and Mary all over Egypt
and um it's important to point out this is these traditions are the written traditions are late
so this is not early evidence of the later evidence but yeah right but it's likely that
early Christianity came as an import into the Jewish community first in Alexandria and then
was able to find some footing but we know at a relatively early time it became a center of
Christian learning the same way as it had become a center of Jewish learning with a Hellenistic spin
so the the the origins lie in a penumbra that we can see we can see somewhat through the the
cloud but we can't see everything that we'd like but we know that by the time that we get to Clement
and apparently he had a great teacher who was also a Christian Platonist right before that
um we would have to date it yeah by the time we would have to date it probably around 16170
yeah it that's the furthest that's the earliest evidence that survives of us being able to see
something concrete but certainly there was Christianity before that but all the documentation
is lost so we don't you know even the Eusebius didn't have access to it I have a blog on this
where Eusebius does what we just did traces it back to Pantinus and then makes the fudges and
makes up a bunch of stuff about the Therapeutae and things like that so even Eusebius didn't
had lost that documentation for what was going on in Alexandria and community Christianity before
that but certainly there was some and not just Alexandria there's North Africa and Christianity
you can sure talk about Tertullian for example is by the end of the second century there's
Christianity's all across North Africa thank you Mark Smith thank you for the super chat bro
any thoughts on the difference between the rod of Asclepius and the caduceus which are often confused
and their connection to John 314 oh my god this compares himself to Moses lifting up a serpent
interesting I I don't I haven't researched this stuff so that's iconography I don't know enough
about it the the caduceus and actually probably the earliest manifestation of it is in traditions
about Hermes and Hermes has the wand that can put people to sleep or raise them and it actually
has other magical qualities so the idea of a magician's wand is very ancient it's pre-Homeric
and Hermes is seen with winged feet and carrying a caduceus and then we have Circe in Odyssey who
also has a wand who uses the wand to have Odysseus's pigs become his soldiers become pigs and to
reverse it but you have Moses with the wand who strikes the rock and he can produce water
so you have the same thing in the Bacchai the women the mine adds in the wilderness can hit a
rock and it can produce wine or water so the idea of a magical wand is a lot earlier than Harry Potter
and um Harry Potter is pretty badass though so no no I'm not I'm not demigrate denigrating it
but then the wand also becomes a symbol of healing because it's it's got magical properties
and so Isclepius and the goddess Hygiene meaning health are often depicted in our holding a caduceus
and you have the double entwined serpents at the top of the caduceus and it's it
actually is a very ancient and interesting trope and it identifies the carrier of it as a magician
we have evidence at Duryuropa of Jesus in a miracle story having a wand
to show that it's magic that he has magical properties so you even have it in the Christian
tradition this this this magical wand yeah I I can't vouch for it but I'm looking at the
Wikipedia article on Caduceus and it looks pretty well sourced so I'm not reading it so I can't
vet it for you as to whether they're doing the source is justice um but it it looks unusually
well resourced so whoever's put this in here and probably what it's saying is pretty close to what
yeah I mean they're they're exploring other hypotheses but it's largely what you said
interesting there's a lot of data and symbols and evidence in there so
I'll just say like go check out Wikipedia I can't say for sure that it's 100%
learn your internet skills learn how to vet a Wikipedia article on exact accuracy
in general because that's a skill everybody should have anyway um but it's iconography is
not one of my specialties so that's the kind of question that I would have to go to the library
to do yeah my phd has taught me how to do that kind of research but it's not something I have on
tap okay here's a little little piece in the cue document when Jesus sends the disciples out he
tells them not to take a stick now it often is thought that that's a walking stick no it isn't
it's a magical wand and the reason I can say that is when Elijah sends Elisha out to heal somebody
um he can't go himself but he can give Elisha the stick of magic that can be used then to heal
the young lad and he says when you go don't greet anybody on the road that's right out that that's
in the story of the sending of the 70 and you you can't you can't say goodbye to your family
and so on so this business about not taking a stick is not a walking stick in my view it's
actually a magical wand you don't need a stick when you go out and heal people you could do so
you don't need magic to do it that's a very interesting it's trying to say something better
so to speak uh it's kind of topping the magic of the Old Testament saying don't worry it's right
you don't need a stick stick in order to do this this is not derivative magic
interesting right yeah okay okay um so one thing I do want to let everyone know we got like
almost 300 people the the two cameras are rolling there I want everyone to know as we continue
join the patron okay he's got a patron he's got books he's a dinosaur like bob he doesn't have
all the internet things we do okay but I'm a member of patron you are oh yeah you joined my
patron I did indeed well I'd give you money yeah I don't know how you did yeah yeah yeah so you know
how to do that much all my stuff you can find at richardcarrier.info.info you can find my patch
on there my facebook page my twitter feed my online courses I teach my blog books everything
you can find it at richardcarrier.info.info how many videos do you think if you were to guess with
the with the sun scorching our brain have we done yeah how many do you think I've lost track we've
done like 30 minute videos a lot of those too by the way I want to say somewhere between 50 and 100
you think mm-hmm oh we've done a dozen maybe a dozen more than more than that me did more than
it does in the first day well me all right what do I know oh anyway all that'll be on
patreon just you know go join yeah it'll be pretty awesome I had to do a plug why not man I gotta
need more are you good I had to plug I had to plug oh yeah Dennis did you want more are you good
that's not wine though yeah now that we now that you can have it without wine
from whoo looky looky that's fine that's fine all right so okay anyway appreciate you guys
want to give a shout out oh myth the mythic life it's Kristen she's back she's getting late on the
east coast and half the head to bed oh that's true yeah do not delete this so I can finish watching
tomorrow he has a backup recording so yeah yeah oh trust me I don't know if it'll be up tomorrow
but it'll be back eventually yeah oh my god I can't believe I accidentally deleted it and you
know when I deleted it was as soon as I exited it so there were people in the middle watching it
that were like 15 minutes behind us at the end and it shut off oh they didn't get a watch the last
damn yeah if you weren't watching that's frustrating you missed out that is frustrating
I've got two legends the legends and the apostle that's me behind the screen
you like my plug seriously though I can't tell you know what pull the books out
real quick they're here what do you want I mean there's so much um all of them why not let's
let's show your books let me show them let me give you give them a rundown on Dennis's stack here
and I have my synopsis to underneath your computer
all right so show them it's it's underneath of course the novum testamentum uh
right good and they've been using that in some of the videos so we like there's a couple times
we're doing like that's true word searches yeah yeah I should have brought mine I I didn't even
think of it that's silly but yeah it's awesome so what do you have Dennis um from the earliest
gospel q plus to the gospel of mark it argues not only for the q document but how mark has used
the q document it's probably the best introduction to that argument right because this one is too
complex it's the shittu ship rick gospel um the the logoi of jesus and papias's exposition
the arguments are made in greek um it's really deep in the woods and I think you can think of it
like this so so this is the book you should read and when you're not convinced and you need to see
the appendix of all the evidence that's this and they're in greek in order to read it right you
this is a book on the acts of andrew that has its own imitations of homer which is developed
was developed away is one of your earliest works right so well and uh christianizing homer was on
the acts of andrew as an imitation and i'm very proud of this one uh what is it
luke and the politics of homeric imitation that shows that luke's imitations of homer are very
similar to the imitations of homer in virgil's in need and this is an alternative mimetic project
to show that jesus is superior to roman um deities and in need but i'm working on a have been working
for years on an alternative english gospel synopsis which i call a mimetic synopsis where is that at
it's right here i'll take these out of your hand okay so and i have to tell people so if you go to
amazon right search for denis mcdonald and find any book if you go to the author page because
amazon has already done this for you right because amazon has created an author page yeah so you have
this whole corpus there and you can actually go through book by book and read the synopsis of each
one and decide like which one you want to like start with first or which one you want to dig into
it's that's the way to go just very briefly though this is a unique reference work that has english
translations of all every word in the gospels with my reconstruction of q with the parallels
laid out from q to mark to matthew to luke but with major introductions of the possible
model literary models that were in greek poetry greek poetry the homeric epics athenian
tragedies especially and it has its own synopsis for the gospel of john in his three layers of
composition septuagintal stuff right so septuagint material um yes i do that i had that i have my own
translation of a number of passages in the septuagint that imitate that are informing
the the gospels but i am thinner on that simply because it's these are available in existing
synopsis for most part if i may and i want to get into your works i mean you're way more
known right to like the youtube world sure i want you in your own words and let me restart this
camera all right because we're filming right all right let me restart this camera over here
okay guys so in your own words i like i don't care where you take this that way anyone watching knows
like there's no blowing smoke up anyone's ass sort of blowing each other's heads up
blowing our heads up and i don't mean that like the literals i mean like just the idea that making
you're trying to kiss denise i'm just picturing uh right i'm asking scanners the movie when people's
heads blow up but anyway how important would you say denise's work is i think it's it's really
it's important in two respects not just well this is super handy i mean i'm when that comes out i'm
gonna actually have a lot of use for it in the future because uh this is the kind of thing you
need to go reference this right if you're going to talk about a passage you can need to go see
what are the references here what what are the illusions that are going on here and this is
going to have material in it that you're not going to get anywhere else that's that's what i think
is the important thing but also the methodology uh the methodology that denise uses to find these
analogies and then demonstrate that they're actually real and not just coincidences they're not just
phantoms uh that methodology is crucial and applicable much more broadly and i think if people
understand this fact once you're convinced of the reality of this phenomenon it really it's a
paradigm shift in the way you understand this all ancient literature uh honestly classicists are
already would you like some more scotch try to pay you off so anyway no yeah well yeah we're
both killing this bottle that we that we bought of view cannons no but it's true uh so i i think it is
that's it is important and that's the one of the effects it has had on my work everyone knowing
this answer that you're saying i have listened to you guys disagree at least over a dozen times
today because we've recorded not today but over the more than a dozen things yeah more than a
dozen recordings uh yeah but you guys when you disagree you say it i mean yes you're you're kind
you're polite you respect one another but you disagree on many things and we understand why
we have the views yes that's the thing you respect his what you don't think is true he respects
what he doesn't think is valid or whatever vice versa but i say that to say you value his work
and most scholars it's been very valuable to mock denise or try to down which frustrates the hell
out of me for a number of reasons but yeah okay let me um say something good about the book
the purpose of having a reference work instead of a hemi a hamfisted um interpretation of the data
is that people need to make their own judgments about the parallels you see it side by side so
there are lots of ways of explaining possible parallels or explaining them away but you can't
have that discussion until you have a good translation and a presentation of the parallels
in a reference work so i really am trying yeah to dial back my own interpretation of the parallels
right yeah and to put them in front of people so they can make their own judgments now um Richard
and i have talked about some of my parallels are stronger than others and some of them i actually
would be willing to backpedal on um because the data isn't as strong as others but what i find is
that readers don't agree on what's a strong parallel and what is weak and i also know they
can be augmented with other parallels and that's one reason i want to put it out in electronic
versions so that people actually could add to it if they want to oh yeah that's a good point right
so your works i want to get into oh okay well i don't have all of them i don't actually only
have three right now um on me uh so well hitler homer bible christ uh that's all of my peer reviewed
and magazine work uh up to 2014 in history so there's a lot of interesting stuff in here on a
diverse number of subjects hence the weird title including i wonder maybe we'll get a video talking
about the work that i've done on hitler studies i'm actually now a major cited person in hitler
studies because of one peer reviewed work i did uh on the subject which has actually led to another
professor producing an entire book that was inspired by my article in german studies review uh on
hitler's table talk and it's an amazing book it's fantastic and and i've worked with him over the many
years that he's produced it it's amazing um anyway hitler homer bible christ is fun because there's
it's a variety of different topics there's short chapters uh on weird different topics and so it
can be entertaining but also it's the cheapest way to get a hold of all my peer reviewed work so if
you go to um if you try to go to the the journals they're going to charge you 20 to 35 dollars for
an article and i don't get a dime of that and this you get all the articles plus a bunch of other
stuff for 20 bucks and i do get a dime off of that obviously on the historicity of jesus is probably
the the most known and best selling of my works uh peer reviewed academic press book that is the
full formal academic case including 90 pages of apparatus at the end of you know bibliographies
and various indexes but um so that's one thing and then uh proving history which i want to get
more books in casement binding because i really all most of uh uh denises books are in casement
binding this is the new thing and i really like it it's a nice feels good yeah it's just i want
more books like this uh i insisted that jesus from outer space be casement bound for its first release
yeah i have the case so proving history is also a peer reviewed book uh it's uh by prometheus but i
and contract required to be peer reviewed before they published and this is the methodologies this
is bayesian history and it starts basic and gets more complicated as you go on so you can stop whenever
you get tired of the weirdness of it but so anyway that's that's that and that talks about how to
talk about history and chapter five is all about the methodology of jesus studies and how you can
analyze it with that and i have several others i've got uh two books on ancient science um the
science education in the early roman empire which has actually come up several times that we're
talking about the understanding the education system in the ancient world is crucial to understanding
a lot of even biblical studies uh and i in that book i cover the whole the whole education system
and i just put a special focus on science content including pop culture there was a such a thing as
ancient pop culture uh up to including juries there's actually is examples of a jury it would be
an opportunity for average people to get exposed to science but anyway um so that's one thing and
then the scientist in the early roman empire is my uh basically the bulk of my dissertation at columbia
university uh produced uh with an extra chapter on the christian side of things but um that's on
ancient science so if you're interested in ancient science and what people thought about it and who
these guys and women some other women were uh that's the book for you and then what am i forgetting
well jesus from outer space is the latest one yeah and that's that's that comes in binding
like this which i find is really nice um and it's it's also comparably short it's like the
same length and it is the colloquial summary of why i think it is reasonable to doubt the
historicity of jesus with a little material that isn't correct it's there's a lot of uh material
i take for granted and i think most historians do or should take for granted but a lot of people
don't know about and as i'm finding now a lot of historians don't know about but anyway it's in
there so i have like a whole chapter for example in jesus from outer space on comparing jesus the
evidence for with a whole bunch of other historical figures like pontius pilot herod and typus uh all
the caesars alexander the great spartacus uh uh um uh Hannibal no it's a whole chapter in jesus
from outer space so i have like whole sections on why do we why are we certain Hannibal existed
and i go through the list of all the evidence we have and and it's evidence we don't have in the
case of jesus so jesus is weakly attested come at best compared to these other authors so
that's an important point that that i and other historians take for granted but i think needs
to be shown to really if you don't know this already like it's an important context so that's
jesus from outer space i'm sure and forget oh why i'm not a christian and of course uh sense of
goodness without god so if you want my fundamental philosophical treatise that is actually and that's
also still a best seller it's a good seller uh and that is a complete worldview if you don't
believe in god what should you replace it with it's not just a negative it's not just why not
that don't believe in god it's also like most of the content is what should you believe in ethics
aesthetics political theory how do you build your political theory on a science-based non-god-based
principle um semantics epistemology all of that stuff's in there so and that's really informed
a lot of my whole life and a lot of my work so sense of goodness without god is an important one
i'm sure i'm forgetting something but that's just a and i've done chapters and anthologies
and various things as well dude that's i mean it's really awesome and we didn't even begin
to scratch the surface you only showed some of your books you've got a bunch yeah right no i want
to mention another one mythologizing jesus is the easiest one and the cheapest one that's actually
the one i recommend people start with if they want to get into this i do i do too i actually
and i want to tell my little funny story about the two two brothers uh oh you do okay we got a
super chat and i want to say about mythologizing jesus at the end of the the there was a certain
album that i'd like to listen to while i read your work and it's become a denis mcdonald album
i'm not kidding you literally i go into the homeric and the odyssey and the ilian and like i get
into this weird epic world when i listen to this uh the muse so muse yeah and um at the end of your
book you asked your grandson you know which one do you like more the jesus epic or the greek epic
here with odysseus and he said i like the greek one better but which one would you rather be like
you know like the which one shows better morals and stuff well the jesus one and i mean i actually
teared at the end of that i was like this is so good it was so amazing uh so it showed appreciation
at the same time i was like yaga yo appreciate the super chat i really do so thank you so much
for the support it says yeah so christianity got to egypt first what about the book of enok found
in ethiopia or eritrea eritrea eritrea um enok uh we have pieces of that from the dead sea don't we
the dead sea scrolls yeah yeah uh it predates so it is a part of the uh ethiopian church's canon
the the ethiopian canon is one of the largest canons of the surviving christian churches
today they have a bunch of books that aren't in uh any other bibles but uh book of enok is one and
i think that's some surprised it didn't survive in the canon of anywhere else because it's so
foundational to christianity um there's actually a lot of texts that we rely on the ethiopian
preservation of that we don't have many other examples of from other places but we have pieces
of enok from the dead sea scrolls which is before the jewish war in judia so we know for sure it
originated it's an incomplete correct yeah but we can attest that it did not originate in egypt it
appears to originate outside egypt and if emigrated there basically yeah that makes a lot of sense
and they think they date that for most people are wondering in the second to third potentially
third century but mostly second or first century bc no no later than first century bc but yeah
no later than what first century bc oh really no oh you mean no yeah okay yeah it can't be any
later than first century bc let me just give a plug for new testament apocrypha um most of the
people who are watching um this show will know something about the gospel of thomas maybe the
gospel of mary the gospel of judas those in my view are among the least interesting christian
apocrypha we also have apocryphal ax of apostles for at least five of the apostles and then a later
one for another um and these uh we also have apocryphal apocalypses we have apocryphal letters of
paul and other correspondence um but these apocrypha are survive in probably six or seven
different languages that no one on the globe can fully deal with and so there's a group called
l'associationle de pour le tout de la literature apocrate in in france that divides uh various um
the various apocryphal texts into language with language groups so you have an ethiopian group you
have an armenian group you have a syriac group you have um a latin group you have uh several greek
groups slavonic and george and slavonic um and the wealth of this information is remarkable now these
texts uh some of them exist in multiple languages so they have to be collated and translated and
evaluated and to think that the christian tradition was devoted to the new testament
and to no other literature and that the mythologizing process stopped somewhere in the early second
century is a another myth that needs to be broken yeah these christians were very good at expressing
their faith with mythology and creativity and we shouldn't discredit it we should try to understand
it as uh because people use myth often to express their deepest and most profound uh truths and um
so there are groups and by the way many of these texts are still not published even in the primary
languages and to let let alone in english and there are some especially canadians now that are
working on the project to get these texts out in english and they are some of them are absolutely
remarkable i've written on the acts of andrew i've written on the the gospel of nicodemus i have
some work coming out on that soon and by the way this writing of apocrypha is not all the cooks
in the world it's not heretics only and it the great church continues to write these things
and in greek orthodox monasteries um in greece even now they read these texts as though they were
scripture so um the protestant notion of sola scriptura right and then putting a fence around
the bible and thinking this is the only kind of christian christian revelation is so historically
anachronistic and limiting that um it's it's one of the the reasons that we have the problems with
fundamentalism as we do all right i'm gonna tell that story we're getting close to all right so
um i was giving a testimony uh in a preterist church in new york and i figure i'd let you
guys see me when i tell the story yeah yeah that's the best way to do it rather than there rather
than being a ghost behind the camera right yeah and i usually am a ghost behind all the cameras
that i do on myth vision but when i'm doing my lives and stuff they get to see me and um but i
love to like put you guys on the pedestal and see the work you guys do like i said a fox chasing
you know the rabbit but i find the groundhogs and that you guys finding all the deep stuff in
the air that's right and i would never know how to find yeah i'd never know how to look for it um
so there's two brothers totally horrible wicked debauched individuals i mean they're like mobsters
running the entire town everyone hates them one of the brothers dies and i'm telling this in front
of a church by the way yeah right and if i cuss it's i didn't cuss at the you know in the church
but yeah i'm emphasizing yeah these are assholes like total jerk douchebags and one of the brother
dies the other brother who's alive goes to the local priest and he says listen uh my brother
just died and the guy the priest is thinking thank god you know and but he's like uh what can i do
for you and he says well listen i've got a check right here i'll put as many zeros on it as you
want if you could just at the eulogy for my brother make sure you let everyone know he's a saint
and so the priest is thinking in his head no hell no and he starts to add some zeros on the check
and he sees these numbers start to build up and he's thinking okay okay i can do that so the eulogy
comes the day comes and the entire town has appeared to this funeral everyone everyone
had been lied to robbed stole from everything you can imagine wrong these brothers did and they're
there to praise the death of this man and the brothers there in the front and here comes the
priest and he says this man you see today he was a debauched wicked evil horrible just the worst
kind of human being he's probably done everyone in this crowd wrong but compared to his brother
he was a saint i'm telling you i love that church laughs so hard it's a good one
the church laughs so hard well you told the story of what was the charioteer uh that was the the guy
who says are you looking for so-and-so is he in your in your wagon and he looks back and is
in the wagon can you tell that story oh it's a trickster story and it comes out of the Amish
Mennonite tradition um German soldiers who were um the Protestants uh in the uh the Lutheran
tradition right we're looking for Meno Simons who was one of the leaders of the Mennonite community
and the the uh Mennonites were trying to escape a village that was going to get targeted by the
soldiers and they stopped a wagon that was being driven by Meno Simons and there were a number of
Mennonite Amish uh ancestors uh in the carriage and the soldiers came up and said to Meno Simons
is Meno Simons back there and he turns around and says hey is Meno Simons back there and they
said no Meno Simons isn't back here so he tells the soldiers no Meno Simons isn't back there
and that's how these people escaped that's a fantastic story that's beautiful yeah wow
you have one or no you don't no no i'm i'm borrowing these i'm gonna steal these and tell
those stories later i used to tell like more i used to have like i can't remember them i always
i hear a great joke and it's hard to hold on to it okay i'm a banjo player and i've got a lot of
banjo jokes oh my god i'll only tell you one or two unless especially if we get somebody to chat us
up yeah we'll do it otherwise okay do you know what a banjo player and a blindfolded javelin
thrower have in common in both cases you don't have to be very good to attract attention
oh ouch okay yeah damn okay okay you want another one yeah um what is the difference
between a south american macaw and a banjo player one is loud and obnoxious and the others a bird
oh my god right right these are like mime jokes uh yeah always making fun of all right you know
how a good musician can tell that a banjo player's at the door first of all that person can't find
the right key second of all the knocking gets faster and faster and faster and third of all
the person is never sure it's quite right to come in
sorry i've got you know what they call a tune banjo a total mistake
oh man ladies and gentlemen huh i said oh dear that's right look we're coming on three hours um

your works holy shit does a show come out and when it comes out it's deep and you really get to mine
for the nuggets that the groundhogs find in the earth and i can see into the hole as a fox now i'm
like holy when i look in the hole like what the hell how did you do that i don't know it's okay
just tell me what you found out there all right i'm going to get a rabbit now um yeah this is yeah

in but i get to see it and it's like whoa beautiful you get well you help other people see it too
