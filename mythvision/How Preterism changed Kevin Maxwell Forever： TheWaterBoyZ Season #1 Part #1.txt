This is what it was again.
I said empty your mind.
Be formless, shameless, like water.
Now you put water into a cup.
It becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle.
It becomes the bottle.
You put it in a teapot.
It becomes the teapot.
Now water can flow or it can crash.
Be water, my friend.
Our guest today is one of our very own water boys.
His name is Kevin Maxwell.
He's the product of a disciplined religious upbringing.
He grew up in a household of Bible college graduates,
including his dad and two uncles.
His family was instrumental in establishing
the Prairie Bible College in Alberta, Canada.
Kevin started reading through the Bible
at the tender age of 12
and attended a Christian high school with Bible classes.
He not only was strong in doctrine,
but he also got to apply his faith
on prayer teams and mission trips
to third world countries.
Kevin's development, however,
took a sharp detour when he became heavily involved
in a biblical cult.
We'll learn all about that experience
and how Kevin studied his way out of it.
His principal interest is in eschatology.
That's the study of last things
and the last days and last times.
And over the past several years,
Kevin has come to understand more and more
in what sense those times were fulfilled.
He's a voracious reader,
a dedicated researcher and teacher of the scripture
who has created more than 30 Bible studies.
His current interests are astral theology,
ancient religions, mythology, numerology,
gamatria, and sacred geometry.
Currently living in Canada,
this man from the land up over
was influenced by our dear brother
from the land down under, Santos Bonacci.
Kevin is a member of dozens of study groups on Facebook.
His own group, which he directs,
is called Sharp and Active.
It boasts some 40 members
and features his own research,
as well as that of other respected scholars.
He welcomes your reaching out to him,
and you can do so through his email,
kevinkmaxwell,
m-a-x-w-e-l-l,
at hotmail.com.
And his Weebly site is kevmax,
just like it sounds,
dotweebly.com.
So without further ado,
over the next 7,000 seconds,
we'll go back the onions on this extraordinary young man,
and I guarantee you,
you will enjoy getting to know this dynamic researcher.
But before that,
my co-host Derek Lambert
is going to share some developments with us.
Derek?
Luther, good job, man.
Looks like we have some breaking news.
We have a story
comes from the Times of Israel,
published on October the 23rd of this year.
Scholars report that fragments
of the Dead Sea scrolls on display
in the museums around the world
may in fact be forgeries.
Yeah, that's right.
Forgeries.
Five of the museum
of the Bible's 16 fragment collection
were sent to Professor Ira Rabin
at Germany's Federal Institute
for Materials Research
and Testing for Examination.
The test concluded that
five fragments show characteristics
inconsistent with ancient origin,
and therefore modern forgeries.
The authenticity of the scrolls
was initially questioned by Dr. Kip Davies
of the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute
at Trinity Western University.
Davies says
that these shocking results
were just for the first lot,
with many more findings to come.
Stay tuned for lots more on this story
as the next month,
the water boys present
noted Dead Sea Scrolls scholar
Robert Eisenman,
now, Luther.
In this story, Derek fits right into
our having Dr. Eisenman
on board.
But the only thing I can say is
to quote Donald Trump, this is huge.
The Dead Sea Scrolls
this 900-odd
fragment collection that represents
the oldest known versions of the Hebrew Bible
both insiders
and outsiders have had questions,
haven't they, Derek, from the very beginning?
Issues about scholarship,
issues of faith,
those who want to have
contact with the scrolls,
they want to own maybe a piece
of these original writings.
And they pay good money for it,
so financing is an issue.
And, of course, authenticity.
And these are the kinds of issues
we love to bring to you
on the Water Boys show, and we will continue
to bring them to the forefront.
We mentioned Dr. Robert Eisenman,
who will be with us on January 3rd
and our
special guest today, Kevin Maxwell,
will be co-hosting with you, Derek,
author and columnist
Edwin Herbert.
And that will be our very next show.
And then on the 13th of December
we've got Dr. John K. Lundwall
and after that
very fine authors, James S.
Valiant and C. Warren Fahey
and they will share with us news
about the Roman
conspiracy to invent Christianity
but this is a different take on it
than you've heard before.
What do you think about that, Derek?
Well, I'll tell you what I think, Luther.
The Water Boys intend to keep bringing you
the research
and the researchers that matter.
We have many more things
planned for you, including a newsletter
with info. We're trying to step our game up.
On upcoming shows
and guest updates, on past
guests, profiles of
explorers, researchers, scholars, mystics,
as well as your participation
as we engage these guests.
So we are asking

Come join us. Kevin Maxwell
is with us.
Let's go ahead and jump right in
and skip right ahead.
Yeah, thanks guys
for bringing me on.
I'm happy. This is like my first
time doing the
actual podcast.
And I just want to share
and help you guys get to know like
who I am and where I come from
in this episode.
So I'm just going to talk about
my story for a bit.
And then later in the podcast
I'd like to go through some of my
PowerPoint
presentation that I made
and just talk about psychology
and
the Bible and interpreting
ancient texts and
because we need to understand
what does it look like
to
be in a cult or be mind controlled
so that we can
answer the question
how do I know
if I was being mind controlled
or how would I know?
This is something
of course that could come across as
offensive.
So it's important to start in a
right place when studying
this stuff.
And I just want to share my experience
of how that happened.
So just a quick summary
of just my life
like I was
basically
became a Christian when I was about 6 years old
my parents just introduced me
to the Bible and we said a short
prayer and I gave them a hug
and that was about it.
And then I went to
start going to a Christian
high school in grade 8 to 12
where we had a Bible class and we would have
Bible memory verses and
so I was familiar with
the text and
they would also bring in
people to speak.
And then I was
I went to college and I
became an architectural
technologist so now I can understand
how
buildings are put together and how things
work in a 3D space so I
can picture that in my mind
and
the whole time of course
I was always interested in the deeper
things of life that's part of my
personality is to understand
why are we here,
how can I be authentic
and how can I
interpret this information
and basically
show that we are more
united than we
stop
because I think we really are
united and we all come from
the same place and we are all
going to the same place
in a sense
but so it was
after the next
five years after college I was
basically
working in construction
I was always studying and
I had this experience
in 2014 where someone
asked me to go out and heal the sick
on the streets and
this time I was actually
I got to see hundreds of miracles
and experience where we went to
this youth conference in Edmonton
and
we just basically went out the whole weekend
and asked people if they wanted prayer for healing
in their body and I was able
to see more of the charismatic
and the supernatural
and it was only until
recently I had been realizing
that this supernatural
phenomenon are not
only in Christian
worldview
with all our denominations
but these supernatural
phenomena are actually in other
religions
in other parts of the world as well
and they even
did a test where people
would pray in the name of Oprah Winfrey
and people would get healed
so it's not
just because you're praying in the name of Jesus
that we see this stuff happen
so it was at this time
I spent about two years
just kind of doing this stuff
and then by the end of 2015
I had an offer
to go and possibly
speak in front of 300 pastors
in India
and this is of course near where I was born
so I was excited
and there was a problem
I wasn't super familiar with
the Bible
I was familiar with it
but I didn't feel comfortable
with my
understanding of that Bible
enough to influence
300 pastors
and their churches
so I was praying for wisdom
I was like I'm an introvert
I'm almost scared of what's going to happen
I'm going to look like an idiot
so I was praying for wisdom
and of course I actually
bought this plane ticket to go to India
I said okay whatever I'll go with you
because you're my friend
it was about this time
I was going door to door
in the Calgary
and it probably couldn't have been
it seemed to be good timing
but it probably couldn't have been worse timing
in the end
but I did get to learn
something very powerful
through this experience
but we started doing
these Bible studies
and at first
I was like well these people look like
they're a little bit too legalistic
and I was like
well maybe if I understood them
then I would see the
fruit of the Spirit or whatever
maybe it's just because we don't understand each other
and I think that was my mistake
is I
didn't see the fruit of the Spirit really
I thought it might be something else
and I was adding to this
fruit of the Spirit
but anyway
I decided to listen to them because
the Bible says to be quick to listen
and I was praying for understanding
so a lot of what they said
made sense though
because they would have these verses that
were supposed to follow Jesus
and he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
and they were
these new covenant theologians
so they created this doctrine
out of these verses
that are taking out of context in the new covenant
and it's because
of the confusion around the last
days
what are the last days
when are the last days
because every prophetic
verse in the Old Testament
that has to do with the last days
can be tied to
some sort of structure that says
oh we have the truth
and this was how
I got sucked in because I was like
okay I have to know if this is true
I have to be quick to listen
and I was praying for wisdom
right
so I ended up leading
into this strange belief system
so these guys
and by the way
I actually told my friend
I was not going to go to India because
I was going to miss the Sabbath day
that's what eventually happened
so I
had already paid for it but I didn't take
the plane I didn't show up at the airport
because I was going to miss the Sabbath day
and I didn't want to disappoint God
or these group members
that were now my friends or whatever
and
so this is part of
manipulation that can happen
is
what I've realized is people are very vulnerable
and more vulnerable than we think
and
so this group because of this confusion
around eschatology was
taking advantage of
some of the offhanded comments
that are throughout the futurist
churches
and they were using stuff
like that in their 50 layers
of doctrine where they would
basically take verso contacts
they would build this up
and paint a nice picture
and say that this Korean guy
who came
as the Holy Spirit in the last days
because we're in the last days
so
and
yeah, God was going to come in the last days
and they would teach
the truth and he would do this
and
so they teach that
we have to keep the seven feasts in the way
that Jesus kept them
so
most of the time I was there I was trying to figure out if this was true
and
after nine months I was able to get out
actually
because
I started seeing something
and I think it was because of the experience I had
before I was in that group
with God is love
without love you do not know God
so that's a pretty strong statement
if you think about it
without love you do not know God
right
so
but I would see
I knew how miracles worked and how God would
answer prayer and how it had to do with
transformation
and it had to do with
your authority
you had to understand your authority and your identity
and
but they did not understand any of that
they were just like
are you crazy and they would just keep going with their doctrines
and
so
I stuck around to try to understand this
and
they actually are teaching that this
lady in Korea there are lots of these groups
that came out in the 60s
and
I think there are like 70 of these
Christs or Missiahs Korean
Missiahs
so they are teaching this
concept of God the mother
so she is the new Jerusalem
in the Galatians 426
and
so this
comes from these concepts
in the Bible
and this has to do
with some of the stuff you guys were talking about
with
the first temple theology
and so this was Adam and Eve
of course
it says in Genesis 1
let us make mankind in our image
well guess what
God makes the end known from the beginning
so in the last
days you have to have
the female image of God
where is that one
so Adam was the male image
so now this lady in
South Korea
their leader she is the God
the Holy Spirit or whatever
who came in the flesh
and
so they had this logical
structure of
prophecies and this modelistic
trinity
for the three ages that are
in the Bible and
I did not have any context
for foundation to understand
or criticize that
that was not even accountable
I would say we need to be open minded
at least to
it is very hard to do of course
in light of what you are saying
but I think we got a good
intro here
in terms of what you have discovered
and what you are discussing here
with your family
we are going to go ahead and skip ahead
this stuff is not easy to understand
the language
is not there just look at all the translations
we have
ancient text and these metaphors
and these parables
and
so I think that is
kind of funny but
so I actually
I said ok I will go
but I am going to basically pray
for wisdom
so I was praying for wisdom
and
basically bought the plane ticket
but it was at this time
that these cult members
showed up
so they just came to our door
wearing suits and they were like
oh I just want to basically have a Bible study
we are not denominational
so I was like ok that sounds
cool I have been praying for wisdom
and the timing
seems kind of right
but I did notice that they were a little bit
legalistic
I guess you could say
and I was like well maybe
I need to understand them before I see
the grace
and the fruit of the spirit
so anyways I just decided
ok I can't hurt to have
a Bible study so
what actually had happened is they had come
the day before
and they had planned to have a Bible study
with one of my roommates
because I was living in
an apartment in Calgary
with two guys
as
the sort of roots in the Pentecostal
church
but it was called Experience Church
and it's really just
practical teaching there
and it's a great community actually
but I don't necessarily agree with everything they are teaching now
but it's
I respect them
and I'm still friends with a lot of them
but
so
back to my story
I started doing these Bible studies
and I actually disagreed
and I would point out the context of these verses
they were taking these Bible verses out
of context and being like
you have to keep the Sabbath day now
and you have to keep these feasts
and
basically they had this
so it kind of made sense
with the Bible verses they were using actually
and at that time I was like
I didn't respond or deal with those Bible verses
because I wasn't familiar with
the Greek language
I wasn't familiar with the context of these verses
but
they would pull a verse out here
and they would connect it to another verse over here
and then it would paint a nice picture
of
something that made sense
so I
started going to this church and I was like
I'll go through your presentations
and I'll see what you have to say
and
basically before I knew it
it was a month later
and I had gone through all
50 of their presentations
they call it 50 doctrines
and so this is a cult that was
out of Korea
it was started in 1960s
and
there's a lot of these cults coming out of Korea
and I won't be naming names
but this group
is basically
saying that you have to keep the new covenant
in the new way
so Jesus said follow me
and
he would keep the Passover from the old
covenant but he would keep it
with bread and wine, he wouldn't slaughter lamb
he would keep it with bread and wine
so
they almost painted this picture that
this Korean guy came
with the new name
because in the book of Revelation you have the new name
and
he came with the new name
and he restored
the gospel in the last days
because the Pope is the antichrist
and he apostasized it and we lost
the truth
so God had to come back
and Jesus talks about the Holy Spirit
in the third person
so you have this
logical stronghold
the Holy Spirit is somebody else
so then you have this modelistic trinity
happening
was this guy
the Holy Spirit?
is this where this is going?
oh wow
he didn't say it directly
but all of his teachings
basically pointed to it
so he was kind of this hidden
don't give them the information
they'll get it eventually
sort of thing
and then basically he prophesied
his own death
and then in 19
he got on a train and left
and everybody there thinks he died
so
so
so it's all like this logical
stronghold
and they think well he
you hit them with enough of these prophecies
and the
big problem is the dating
of the book of Revelation
and the confusion around
what is the last days
because if we're in the last days now
then you can pretty much
tie any prophecy that
talks about the last days to today
and you can make this logical system
right
so that's why
when I got out of this group
first of all
how did I get out of this group?
Kevin
before you say that
what was it that tipped you off
that this was a cult?
I mean it wasn't just the doctrine
of red flags going on too?
Oh yeah
there was turmoil, obviously my family
was kind of these liberal Christians
they were all
I think it was harder for them than it was for me
for me I was like
just trying to understand
the whole time I was there
what are you sure about?
I was just questioning and I was interested
and I was looking for truth
and fortunately
I had a little bit of a background
with how
the character of God in my life
and with the example
of the parents I had
and with the experience of grace
and
fortunately
with this grace and love
teaching that I had from the Charismatic Church
I was able to see
through some of their
some of their lies
with
like one thing was
like I remember
they would get on the phone with
this
let's call her God the mother
so they teach that there's God the mother
she's the new Jerusalem in Galatians 4
26
the Jerusalem above is our mother
so that's what the verse says
and so they teach that this is
this lady who's in Korea
and I think there's a few different cults
that are teaching like sort of this thing
if you don't mind me
I mentioned right here
because I think this is important Kevin
with what you're saying
and Luther you might want to add to this
because where we're going in our research
discussing Margaret Barker
and the divine feminine
I think the reason why
and this is not the only case that this happens with cults
this has happened in
Mormonism
this has happened in many cases where
the divine mother
or divine feminine
model is coming back
because we really are
able to see
this is in the text
there are things in the text that
emphasize a heavenly
or some form of a mother feminine divine
figure in the Bible
and so I just wanted your thoughts
if you guys wanted to emphasize something there
it's easy to say okay well it's my mom
now worship my mom
you know
yeah and Derek you know it's a very old
issue
it's what was going on as you pointed out
between the first temple tradition
and the second temple tradition
so it goes back into the history of Israel
and here as Kevin was saying
you know here it is coming up again
the position of the divine
personage of the deity
and maybe misrepresenting
that divine person
it's all cyclical it's amazing
well yeah
like a lot of the themes what they're teaching
they all clicked amazingly
when I started learning about
preterism
because I realized what the last days
actually were
but this whole
teaching of God the mother comes from
like this Adam and Eve
well in the Genesis
one it says let us make
mankind in our image
so they manipulate that and say well
what was the image of God
well there was Adam and there was Eve
so there's the female image of God
so this is the new Jerusalem
in the book of Revelation and it becomes
this sort of thing
and of course it's not just
that you can't convince somebody just based on that
but it was the whole picture
there that they're painting
and so
because they have again they have like 50 doctrines
on what to believe
and they've worked it out
and they've like you have to
they've taught it again and again and again
so
so one thing that I was noticing
that helped me get out of there was
they would ask
the leader of this God
figure
for something to happen like a blessing
or this many people to show up for
Passover
so this would happen
and then
so then this lady
who led the church was
basically said okay good
50 people will show up for the Passover
and
the Passover count around and
it was still only 30 people
and
so
the next day you show up
a church basically you get shame and guilt
and say you didn't have enough faith
so God didn't do it
and I was like wait
man
something's wrong with this picture
wow dude you were really
in some um I don't know if you guys
have seen the show called the path
it's a uh it's a Hulu
original if you haven't seen it
I'm plugging it nobody's paying me
to plug this but I'm telling you
I really need to call him and tell him
you need to pay me to plug this because
I'm telling you the path
sounds just like that
this is cool this is cool so
well
again it's what I'm going to talk about
in my presentation but
it's the
it's behavior control
it's us versus them
right it's uh it's divisions
it's uh
so the bible does actually talk
about some of this stuff
and what you'll see is that psychology
actually supports
uh sort of these
full preterist view
in the sense of
the old covenant was about rewards
and punishments
so
so anyway so I actually started
from that point
in 2016 that was a K-Pass
over
and
Mar
I'm going to start making a list of these
biblically weird interpretations
because you'd go up to a brother
leader the house church leader and you'd say
well what about this
this didn't make sense and then they would
just point to the six other doctrines
that made sense to you and be like well
well it doesn't matter because this this
this and this
so so it was it's just like
and it's you
so now it's like
I you people need today
need to be able to answer the question
how do I know if I'm
being mind controlled
right if you just think about that for a minute
because
like
do I have a good answer for that question
how do I know if
I've been manipulated or mind controlled
by a group or church
or what would it mean to be
basically mind controlled
and uh and how big
of a problem is it because
we we get into
we go to our church we do this
we do that we follow our routines
and
and so
so we almost set ourselves up
for some of this stuff
because we're not ready
we don't know we don't know how that stuff works
so that's why
like these cult experts will say well
they need to teach psychology
in our schools because
because then we can actually just learn
to discern some of this stuff
but um
Kevin this is this is good right here
it resonates with me because
I've been involved in groups like that somewhat
not to the extreme you have but uh
you know I caught myself
over the past 12 years at least
12 years of my life where
I would think um
up my convictions
um
no matter what I went back to
presuppositions and so
these what you're saying psychologically
is there is
some form of concrete
at the base of our psychology
that
like cults are really good at
building that somehow they do it with emotion
they do it with something else I'm not sure how
it all works because I'm not a
skilled in that way of understanding that but
I do know that
we deal with people daily on the internet
that when you suggest
a new principle or suggest
you know looking into something
they they'll
as hard as they want to
they can't and they might try
I know I can't do that I can't follow that
like whoa this is deep
seated you're not even willing to
really try honestly looking into it
how do you crack the concrete and get
to that point so I can relate
yeah
yeah like as I was coming
out of that group you I was seeing
what it did to my family
but every time my my
my dad would ask me like
like do you see the lie in that
because I'd go through like a presentation with
him and he would ask me like do you
see the lie in that Kevin
and I was like what are you
talking about
and then he would
get depressed because he doesn't know how to
he doesn't know how to deal with a cult member
you know people haven't been taught how to deal
with their family member getting sucked
into a group like this right and
so it's not just
for you but it's for your you might
be one of your elevatives or somebody
you know who's has this sort of
issue and how do you actually
how do you have a relationship
with somebody like that
and exactly and Kevin
things can be problematic
in your own family of origin
but when a cult accepts you
and they provide
their version of love
I mean that can be a powerful
part of
rewards and punishment you know the
psychologist would say that in some
way a cult has to tie in
to
conditioning where there's a system
of rewards and punishments
and if you buy into that
then it becomes
much much harder
to leave and I guess you can see
it when there's an internalizing
of the values
of the cult you know
when what is put out there
as personal becomes
private and you find all sorts of private
ways
in yourself to reinforce what it is
the cult is teaching
and it makes sense
and the thing is like
my mind would be blown as I'm learning
this stuff and I thought I was
a free thinker like it while you're
there you don't think well I'm being deceived
no
because people who are deceived
don't know they're deceived
exactly
and you can be confident
while having bad information
and that's a big problem
psychologically because people
are going to see that
and be like well he must know something
right and it's
attractive confidence is what's
attractive in our culture
I can respect that and where you're getting at
in the root of this is that free thinking
is the concept I created the free thinking
room for that very reason
because I can't tell you how many
times I used to know
the truth I used to know
the answer and it was my
it was my sledgehammer
as well as my shield but really
let's be honest
I was attacking okay I was coming after
you with my calvinism
and my reformed
predestinarian hard-coreness
okay and on and on and on but
that being said
I am so happy
now that I know
that I can't really know
what I used to know
and that Buddhist saying
you know a man or one who
seeks to know the truth
holds no opinions
like I use that lately but it's true
because man I am so free
like you could tell me tomorrow
look guys UFOs
actually control everything we do
if there was enough proof
and I'm not talking about a cult movement
I'm witnessing actually physically
first I'd see if I was hallucinating
I mean I'm open I'm like
okay what is truly going on
so I can respect
what you're saying for real
yeah and what
predatorism did for me was
well I've been listening
to the Odyssey recently
and this one saying this guy
has is even the
fools are wise when all is said and done
so
so like
the predatorism
it puts all this fear and stuff
in your past
and it gives you audience relevance
and actually sets you free
to think about it more creatively
and more naturally
I would say
okay Kevin just for
audience who may not be familiar
with predatorism
if you could just explain briefly
what that doctrine is
yeah well predatorism is
basically it just means in the past
and so it takes all these
elements of
the book of Revelation
of the second coming of Christ
and it
looks at it in the light of
what Josephus the first century historian
wrote
and recorded which
you can see the parallels
to the text in the bible
and you see that oh Jesus coming
was in the first century
and these were metaphors
so predatorism to me
stands completely on its own
it is because it's
based on the truth of the
time statements and there's dozens of these
time statements in the New Testament
and
so you either have to
like some of the futurists or these
cults are teaching you have to
say well they were mistaken or you have to
say these last days
are metaphorical so everybody
is taking the text metaphorically
to some extent
right
I can agree so predatorism
saved you from being
close minded it was the beginning
of this journey
yeah
predatorism was amazing because
well there's a book
from this partial predatorist
who I respect is
Jonathan Welton
he's just a really good teacher
I found his books easy
to read but
he has a free book
rapturalist.com
which was the first book I read
when I got out of this cult
and basically this book
it's mostly just
evidence
it's mostly just historical evidence
of what happened in the first century
and it leaves you almost unfounded
with wow really
I didn't know there was this much evidence
of the fulfillment of the second
coming of Christ
it's just like
so
what I did
coming out of this cult was
I had made this list and I still have it
it was just all the biblically weird
interpretations
this verse like this
or they can't answer this verse
or this verse is twisted
because of this
and
there was some verses that they tried to explain
but it never made sense
one of them was in
Romans 6
it says Jesus cannot
die again
and
this church leader had died
he prophesied his own death
as the Holy Spirit
so
they kind of explained that away with
sort of a metaphorical thing
so even they were taking some of these texts
metaphorically
they basically say that we're right
and
something
and you feel like it's the right thing
because it's easier
so it's hard
to suffer for the truth
and there's this saying that
Santos Bonacci says
when you bring the truth
to somebody and they reject it
they're
buying it in the place of the skull
right
so the Golgotha
is where Jesus was crucified
which means the place of the skull
so there's another way
of this
to take these things metaphorically
but
why don't
we
get into my presentation
and I'll just start screen sharing
how's that
sounds like a great idea
or is it too soon
no because
we can go ahead and jump in brother
ok
so
how's that
can you see that
I cannot
ok
there you go
ok
can you see that now
just the power point
ok
yeah
so this was just some of my story
basically I already went through it
with you guys
so I'll just skip ahead here
so this is of course
2014 again
there's all that teaching
in the charismatic church about love
and
not many should be teachers
of course there's lots of
groups
and
so this is kind of
summarizing some of what I realized
in the cult itself
because there was a few things that
stuck with me and I still
kind of hold to just
pieces of their doctrine
that were good but they would twist it
at the end
because
like even if
something is
like 80% true
the 20%
of what they're teaching
can be bad and that means
the whole thing is bad so you really have to
almost throw out the whole paradigm
clear your mind
and then go back and like
take what's good
and the
Kevin if you don't mind me asking about this
are we about to get into
interpretation
is that where we're about to go with this
are you going to be giving us after you explain
what your research is
are we going to get into some text
in the near future
well there's
I have a few bible verses
in here
I'm going to be talking a little bit
more about the psychology
and
the fruit of the spirit
divine nature that the bible talks about
so it's going to be all
it's all themes in the bible
and
I just want to help us
just to develop
and have different tools
so that we can
process this information
so we can harmonize
this information
so that we're not so divided
and that we see
that we're all actually more connected than we thought
and
of course that's a big thing
to try to accomplish
I think it's a good place
to start with because
there's a lot of people
I could jump in the deep end with astral theology
but a lot of people would be scared away
so I want to get people
just
knowing how I think about stuff
before I jump in the
deep end
that sounds good
so
so this power point is
like how will you
process all this information
that's because we're in the age of information
we have the internet now
for the first time
like
what I say is all information
is
interpretation because
information will give you context
it's providing your foundation
this is going into your subconscious
this is how you're going to
this is all a lens
for how you're going to
read stuff and interpret stuff
and
so there's some helpful categories
to
put information into
so
of course I've been studying eschatology
and this was a list
that I got
from this partial preterist
and it was helpful for me
at this time
because I hadn't studied eschatology
until after I left this cult
to be aware that there was actually
more than one view of eschatology
like
as I grew up nobody told me
that there's different views
than a future coming of Christ
there's different views than
a last judgment
and they're actually scholarly views
and people have worked them out
because all I would get
from this kind of bible college town
with the church on every street corner
is these offhand comments
that
oh second coming
it's going to be wars and rumors of wars
brother
and just like you get these sort of
comments every once in a while
from these bible college graduates
so you assume they know something about the bible
but the more I talk
to the bible college graduates
they don't know how they've never heard
of eschatology
and I'm still wondering
why that is
because it seems like it's been around
for the last 2000 years
so Kevin
you found that the differences
in eschatology
tend to be more concealed
than the differences in
salvation or redemption
or soteriology
is
it
the eschatology
is sealed
because
growing up people read the bible
and they avoid it or they're afraid of it
they're like oh I'm never going to understand that
and then once they understand a piece of it
they go out and they create
a denomination
and
that's how we have
all these denominations
and we think that they're saving the world
and
so we have to stop
making denominations
people may say
well the baptists are into
salvation
and the methodists into discipleship
but the only thing that's important
is that Jesus is coming back again
and we all agree on that
but we don't all agree
on that
and again
it's part of just making people
raising people's awareness that people don't actually agree on that
because
people aren't aware that people are
disagreed on that
and then they can
start to open up to those ideas
and look into
a different perspective
and
because I think people do want
the truth and there's a lot of people
who are searching
it can be hard when all we have
is like a Facebook group
or whatever to share that information
it can be hard to
communicate or develop a relationship
where it's actually a meaningful study
or whatever
because I think this is the first time
we have this information
but we have limited
levels of communication
I love doing this face to face Skype thing
I think it's great
I think it's different if you're in the room with the person
and that was one thing about
this cult I was in is
we would go play frisbee in the backyard
it felt like a normal group of people
and yet you have all these weird doctors
and
looking back of course
so
here most of the church is
I would say
futurist still
there's a lot of churches out there that are teaching
the futurist view
and
and that of course
so there's this widespread
view of Christianity
as a sort of futurist
doomsday religion
I think
because
you talk to some of these psychologists or cult experts
and they'll say Jesus was
a cult leader
because of this futurist view
I would say
it's funny you say that because
you said it's a doomsday
type of thing
I can hear a charismatic pastor
hearing what you just said
it's not a doomsday
for me and my church
we will not be there for the destruction
he will come in reigning glory
I could just see someone poetic
coming at it like
it's not a doomsday for me brother
let me explain to you why when the lord comes back
his shining glow
so
who cares about you
I don't care about my enemies
they're going to burn
I mean it's not completely like
let's not
we're being funny
they're really trying to save souls
I mean it's controlled politics
it's controlled nations
I mean
there's been a lot of big things
that have happened
again there is
yeah you're cutting in a little bit
but
yeah there's a lot of
confusion
and a lot of misinterpretation
because
of how language has changed
over the last 2000 years
people think oh it's obvious because
it's this social influence
that's basically
controlling them
or just like
social influence is the nice way of
brainwashing
so I prefer to use the term
social influence
because you see that everywhere
and then you realize oh this is
actually everywhere
with advertisements
especially in our culture
if you buy this you'll be happy or whatever
and so that's
part of social influence it's in the peripheral
vision
so it's when you're not
exactly focused on it so what are some
strategies that we can have
to be more effective
I would say
for astrophiology
learn the zodiac constellations
learn the signs
and
because some of this stuff is the oldest
stuff we know of
that has to do with religion
and the oldest
stuff the older usually is the better
is the more accurate
because then you see okay this is how it
where it started
this was where it was inspired or coined
and then it was changed
or somebody interpreted it this way
and now the word means that
so again this is a it takes a lot of time
to go through how words are
were first
interpreted
but like the big one I've realized recently
is the word world
in the New Testament as cosmos
and
the person to say that word
was Pythagoras
who gave us our Pythagorean
theorem
and he was a
philosopher in the 5th century BC
so it was actually
this philosophical
term that describes a perfectly
structured and organized universe
and
it was actually a word used
to describe the law
or the old covenant
right or the
is it a cosmos
where we get our word cosmos
but I won't jump into that too much
hold up nope you already
you already popped the top my friend
so
me being an ex-reformer
okay an extremely
hardcore Calvinist
we always emphasized that world
did not mean the entire
world every time in fact
what in the world
was world
meaning that's really what
you know so we look at words
like all world these things
but that tells
me we as
preterist who have also
worked ourselves into a certain
way of thinking the word world means
need to reevaluate
by considering Pythagoras
and maybe what some of these mathematicians
who predate the New Testament
are talking about with the term
world I think it's very important
because we always think world means
just old covenant age
or it has nothing to do with the literal
physical heavens because look the end already
happened and we know it can't be
the literal physical heavens because
if the end already happened the literal physical heavens
never ended where they don't have a clue
about precession they don't understand
the zodiac they don't understand exactly
what you just said proving your point
yeah and that's again
what it has to do with how the word is actually
being used and like
harmonizing it for say the time
statements like preterism does
and say well
if Jesus wasn't lying about
when he was going to come
then world doesn't
mean the planet earth
it actually means
the end of these the elements
of the tabernacle
or the or this this temple
which would
be representative of
maybe the physical world
so
so about Kevin about Jesus
not lying he said
he would come back shortly
in a little while about
to come back to this generation
right
yeah and in Matthew
1627
is a big one for
for his time statements he says
there's some standing here
who will not taste death
until they see the Son of Man
coming on the clouds
all you guys are not going to be dead
before I come back again
I saw two
than the other day
so when you present that to somebody
what do they say when you present that
to an evangelical Christian
what do they say
supposedly they're Bible believing
well a lot of the
evangelical Christians actually say
well I don't know that's a strange verse
like I've talked to some of the
some of these schooled
people who have gone through Bible college
and a lot of them say well that's a weird verse
and it's like
I think one day God's going to explain all this
to us so they
really approach it mysterious the cult I was
in actually
asked them about that verse
in 2016 and they said
well that's the 144,000
and I was like what
that didn't make any sense to me either
because
they were standing in front of him so
so
was there like two resurrects
I don't know they didn't believe that
they were teaching a premillennialism so
a lot of the
doctrines of that cult I was in
came from the Seventh Day Adventist
movement
being able to realize
a lot of these Korean cults
teach the
6000 year redemption plan
and they basically said that
they came up with it well
it actually came from Augustine
and
I don't know because he talks about it
he actually says that
the Seventh Day creation
in Genesis the six days
represents one day as
a thousand years into the Lord
so day six he created
man and at the end
that's when he finalizes his work
his Seventh Day he rest
is the return, is the completion
the consummation of all
things under him and that is
where they get this idea that the end is
and I suspect they're applying that
to their cult
yeah yeah yeah they are
they're basically saying we're coming to the end of that
6000 years World War 3
is going to be the end of the world
like
they promised they said they were like
standing out care packages in 2012
when people thought that was going to be
the end of the world and stuff
so again
their doctrines they don't emphasize this stuff
it's not obvious that they're like
this doomsday cult but it's in their doctrines
and so it just
this sort of stuff happens naturally
so it's not as obvious
as a lot of us
would think standing on the outside
and so like
we need to realize
right we probably wouldn't agree
even with ourselves
right
do you agree with what you believed
10 years ago
no
so how do we
agree with the
why are we so worried about agreeing with each other
right so this is verse
in Amos
I think it's chapter 3
in the King James version
which I don't like the King James version
to be honest
but it says
how can two walk together unless they be agreed
so
some have called this the church dividing
Bible verse
because people think oh we need to be agreed
I like the Young's
literal translation of that verse
is how can two walk together
unless they have agreed to meet
which
to me actually
proves a mythological
view in a sense because
Jesus agreed to meet with his disciples
he didn't agree to meet with me
right
and in the mythologies
like in the Maburata it says
a person can't be called a friend
unless he warns you
himself right
so Jesus never came down to the earth
and warned me in my last days
right
so I just
I think it's good to think about some of the stuff
because it has to do with the character of God
it's all connected
and
so I want to ask how can I
harmonize all things
without my understanding of being shaken
right
Romans 12-5
my relationships, my community, my spirit
so yeah
like the Bible I think they had
because you see this
where Paul's talking about
the eyes for has one purpose
but it doesn't make fun of the finger
right because
so there's this esoteric
wisdom that's in there
and I think it's actually true
psychologically with some of what they're saying
because these guys were
smart and I think that's
part of why Christianity has been around
and grown so much
as people are smart
and I think that's something in the Bible
so
I just want to talk about the four levels of communication
now this isn't
to do with the zodiac or anything
this is just how
to do with how open are you
and how vulnerable are you
in
your conversations
because again I think it's good to be reminded of this
even if you've heard it before
but the first level
is not official
basically it's thoughtless
your cliches
you hold the door for somebody
this is the first level of communication
it doesn't
it takes zero effort
or sacrifice
and
you don't have to overcome any fear
on this level
number two is
basically the neutral facts
so now you're
talking, you're going day to day
you talk to your husband
your family member
are we going to do the oil change today
so you haven't actually got
you're not getting into
so here at this level
you can actually still be in a bad relationship
and
you can still get by
by just talking about the facts
it's nothing vulnerable yet
you haven't opened up
so this is getting into
at the end we're going to talk about
what the Bible is getting at
with the power of love
and the fruit of the spirit
I was just reminding of myself
of this as I was making it
because this is the stuff I had studied
that helped me come out of this cult
that I was in
so the third level gets into
opinions
so this is what you see on Facebook
this is about
convincing people
with people
this is
basically it comes from this fear
which comes out
in opinions
so when you have fear in your life
I believe it comes out in these opinions
and with anger
because sometimes anger
is a way to cover up fear
or it's a way to
express something that you don't know
how to deal with
it's dangerous because it's not the goal
of communication
so we think
I need to convince this person
because I need to be
agreed with them
because it's a misunderstanding
what I believe the Bible
says that truth is
so Jesus actually
says
you shall know them by their fruit
right
so fruit
is this natural thing
that happens after
you've received truth
well truth isn't black and white
well this is right this is wrong
it's us and them
truth is well it's actually hard
to know what is right
and wrong in every case
truth is well
you're free to think creatively about that
right
so
so this level 3 again
this is Amos 3-3
this is how can you
account for opinions
without being all knowing
such a question I want to pose
is how can you
talk about truth
being free to be
creative in how
you approach the issue
well that's exactly what was going on
with the Gnostics
and the reason why they got into so much trouble
with the Historicists
the Historicists would look at the many
variants of Gnosticism and they say
you guys can't even agree
everybody's got his individual variation
on it but to Gnostics
if we may call them such a group
that was a strength of it
in other words the doctrine
wasn't really true
until you made it your own
you had to somehow
incorporate it into your thinking
in an original way
whereas the Historicist
church thinks that oh we've got
to believe exactly the same thing
the propositions have got to line up
it's really two different ways
of looking at truth isn't it
yeah it is for sure
and you start to realize
that all these cults
are actually the same they operate the same way
and then it's
almost easy because then you know how
you can set up how you're going to respond
you can control your responding
ability so then
you can decide how am I going
to act around somebody who's like this
so I think
this is going to be important as we move into the future
with information
so the fourth level
is what I'm going to be talking about
more
so this is the deepest level
of basically vulnerability
this is like
instead of saying
oh
you're stupid
because this
if you can replace it
with like
I think then you're still
actually in the opinion level
right but if you can say
I feel
let's say I feel hurt
because you said this
so sometimes it's good to go to this
deeper level and
people will actually sometimes
respect that some people won't
they're just mean but
so the goal of
this is about
understanding
this is what the bible talks about
understanding
so there's
it begins as a piece of wisdom
and we all argue
about what wisdom is
who can attain it
but we're trying
when we communicate with people we're not just
trying to agree
we're trying to understand each other
that's how we can have a wife
with people around us
so this is the goal of communication
is
the power of love and this is the grace
that the bible talks about
and
like who wants to
feel understood right
so personally I would rather have
people around me that
they don't need to agree with me but they
it would be nice to be understood
right
again understanding
is still limited without
knowledge right
because there's some knowledge that can
depending on what you're talking
about knowledge has to do with
understanding
obviously
and again this is
I was just saying something astrological
is knowledge has to do with
the day or the summer months
because you can see
plainly God in Romans 1
Paul says
God has made a plane to them
through nature and what can be seen
so this just
reminds me of the zodiac I guess
because it's the cycles of life
is it fair to say the reason it reminds
you of the zodiac is because of
all the initiation
and understanding that you've been given
because you know how they always
use the we start with the simple
and the clear and the plane and then we work
more complex well
I mean to you and me
we are looking for it because
we know it's there after all
that we've seen we know it's there
to someone else they may not
see what you're saying so sometimes you gotta
break that down so that they
understand the importance of
I guess you'd say like
it's a template
and we know that this
text and I mean these texts
in the ancient
world they were using this stuff
like this was part and parcel
to their religion their science
I bet you anything if the temple was still
standing
there was probably zodiacal
imagery and zodiac stuff
all through the thing
but of course it was tore down
yeah and like a part of why
I can understand the stuff
is I
I started a few years ago
with the basic fruit
of the spirit what's
producing the fruit of the spirit in my life
once you get that down
and you realize okay God
is love and I don't have
to worry every day
about new information
right then
you can be free to
say oh let me discern
that
let me listen let me
be quick to listen
right what does the Bible say
be quick to listen
slow to speak
slow to become angry
so these were
the virtues that the Greeks were studying
and like
if you read Cicero
he believed that you could ascend
and become with the stars
and the constellations
by living a virtuous life
so and in the Bible
it talks about how at the resurrection
they would become as the stars
in Daniel 12
forever and ever
so well then Kevin
preterism poses another
problem because for those
who say everything ended in 70 AD
including the work of
the Holy Spirit
they would be called cessationists
some would call them
then who's going
to instruct people
about the fruit of the Spirit
how will the fruit of the Spirit be imparted
even what we say
or how we argue
or how we share with one another
or how we discuss or whatever
if you don't believe that the Holy Spirit is active
today
so this is
why
I take the logical view
because you can still hold onto the esoteric
spiritual principles
you can still have hope
because you realize
that the point of this mythology
was not to
prove to you a historical figure
existed
this is about the
Savior within
Colossians 1.26
the mystery has been revealed
it's about Christ and you
beautiful
let me ask you guys this real quick
because on that topic
they talk about blaspheming
the Holy Spirit
and so forth
in this age and
the age to come
but what's interesting of that
because we're now talking about another age
that they really can't explain
the cessationist
if you look
most Christians would suppose the Holy Spirit comes
on the scene later
but they don't realize that there were 70
ancients
with Moses who received the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit
and two, middad
and I think it's middad
and I can't remember the other guys name
we're left at the camp
we've been talking about the number 72
so even in the old stories
you have this outpouring of the Holy Spirit
and the New Testament is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit
who's to say this isn't
an ongoing cyclical common
theme of
esoteric
spiritualism of some sort
because there's a variety of spiritual
thinkers and stuff
I'm just saying general basic
principles of living and
and so forth
right
and it's again the through the Spirit
has to do with
realizing
that you are right with God
and
and how does God actually deal with sin
so you study the covenants to realize
well how does God
deal with people
and you study
the zodiac to realize
where these covenants came from
and what they're based on
and then you can say okay now we can have a clear
picture of
what these people viewed God as
and that's what's most important to me
is to have a context
because context is king
preterists always say context is king
but their context
they've limited it to the Bible
because
there's a scripture that I believe is actually
twisted
in Timothy 2 Timothy 3
16 I think it is
where it says all scripture is inspired
well if you look at the original Greek
the word is is actually inserted in our
English versions so is could be
actually placed after it
and say all scripture which is
all scripture inspired
is from God
so instead of saying
all scripture is inspired
I could just say all scripture inspired
is from God
so and how is it inspired
right
if they're looking at the stars all the time
these ancient people
and looking at agriculture
and how they're living
so again the word spiritual
what does spiritual mean
we think that just means
well it's the invisible realm
we don't know about that stuff
it's just godly it's mysterious
well
if you actually look at some of these parallel mythologies
I'm realizing
in the Babylonian
things they had this god
who was the god of the air
well the spirit means
the wind or the air
and he was the god of the intellect
so
the air actually
in this Gnostic wisdom has to do with
the intellect or the higher mind
or the upper half of the zodiac
I guess you could say
because
the air is the softest part
so it's feminine
so anyway
the point is like
we shouldn't just look at
these definitions of these words
we should study the etymology
so etymology is
basically how the word was formed
over time
so when I'm going on
Google I punch in
what is etymology of
and then I'll put this verse
or this word
that I'm looking into
and then there's usually
you might have to scroll down a bit
but there's usually a few good sites
that give you how this word was changed over time
and that's
been really actually helpful
where stuff came from
anyway
so again this is
this is my way of
basically harmonizing
all this information
so there's this verse
in 2 Peter 1
it talks about the divine nature
so
basically God says
right become partakers
of the divine nature
so this was the goal
of the promises
and if you think about
what nature means
right we think of like
self control
we read self control as the fruit of the spirit
I believe we've misunderstood the word self control
we think God's all sovereign
and he's trying to control us
and we actually were waiting for God
to take our hand
and control us
well what if self control just means
control over yourself
right what if
like I actually knew how I was going to
live today
and I was going to do it intentionally
and I was going to be aware
of how I'm responding
in my relationships
so this is what I think
the divine nature means
because
in the first century
in
Cicero in 45 BC
he writes about his book
on the nature
the divine nature of the gods
and
he's actually
it's mostly astrological
and he's basically
trying to prove that the stars are gods
and that since
our best selves have
these virtues
that the gods must have them in
more quality
and since they move across
their sky and their orbits
well they must be living
they must have an intelligence
so it's really interesting the way he explains it
like we wouldn't think about it that way
but
you know like
without love actually the bible says
you do not know God
so this was key for me
to get out of this cult mindset
because
I would sort of love you
but it was superficial
it wasn't like oh I really care about you
and I actually have a relationship
no it was like okay if you agree with me
we can be friends
like that's not
what the bible is talking about
sorry
so the only way Jesus teaches
his disciples to discern the true teachers
from the false ones
is actually by their fruit
not exactly logic
not exactly by the truth
not exactly by wisdom
but
fruit so that's Matthew 7
so
fruit is important because
in the cult I was in they would take Matthew 721
and they would say
um
on that day
if you didn't do what I said
I'll say I never knew you
right Matthew 721 he says
he's warning with the last judgment
even though you went out and you healed the sick
and you did miracles
they will come
and I will say I never knew you
so they use this verse to defend their feast keeping
this is you have to keep the new covenant feasts
Jesus said
eat my flesh, drink my blood
so that's the Passover
so you have to keep the Passover
so
this is a pretty big stretch
so this is kind of like a modern
Roman Catholicism
and you just can't let this thing go
it just seems like
no matter what we've been 2,000 years now
guys and we've got to have a cookie
and a little bit of punch come on now
well here's the thing
they would have a sermon
and the whole sermon would be about the divine nature
but it's at one of their feasts
and they don't talk about the feasts
everybody's already keeping the feasts
they don't need to know about that
so they add to this list of
what is the divine nature
of the second Peter
and you'll see this everywhere
if you actually pay attention
second Peter chapter 1
he talks about self control
brotherly love
all these things
this is the divine nature
well
what people don't realize is that these groups
are adding to that list
why are they adding to that list
why are they adding the Sabbath day to that list
so
that people haven't really picked up on
or thought about
and I think it could be really practical
as well
so
this is the book I just talked about
on this slide
again Paul has this view
of God being all in all
so this is something
I was dealing with when I realized
full preterism
was sure that all things had been fulfilled
that
okay then what
God is all
all
this was too little information
to know exactly what was happening
because this is all it says
after the resurrection happens
and
the new covenant is described as they will no longer
teach their neighbor
so why are we all teaching each other
in the new covenant
if the new covenant is here
and Hebrews says
the old covenant is gone
or faded away
exactly
and even in the old covenant Kevin
there were glimpses
of that divine nature
resulting in self control
the internalization of the fruit of the spirit
if you will
take for example one I always like to use
is Joseph
now this is the Old Testament
you remember the character
Joseph one of the 12
and so here he is
he's in Egypt
and he's working in the household
of the Egyptian Potiphar
and he's tempted
I'm sure by Potiphar's wife
who makes a pass at him
it's an act of sexual harassment some others have said
if you accept that
but at any rate
Joseph says
I cannot sleep with you
because to do so
would be to
betray God
and to betray my master's faithfulness
now this is the Old Testament
you think God would send an angel
and say don't you sleep with that woman
everything has to be
cause and effect in the Old Testament
but no Joseph shows
self control
even then in an age
where we're used to God doing the miraculous
and big things to
show off
the last thing it seems
that we do is to internalize
the divine nature
everybody wants, seems to want
God to do something for them
instead of doing something in them
what do you think?
like I went through this
teaching series on YouTube
it's called
Harvest Chapel School of Kingdom Living
with Dan Muller
but so some people call him
Happy Dan
because he's always happy
and
again he talks about
the fruit of the spirit
and
so the school
he teaches
it's pretty simple
it's basically
saved by grace through faith
right
so we're saved by grace
through faith
so
the grace comes
and
we believe that
and we're made whole
right so
the word saved has this word sozo
which means made whole
safe and sound, secure
right so we think
saved is just go to heaven one day
but
sozo doesn't mean that
right
saved means
I'm made whole
so you're healed
so this is why
I believe healing is actually
central to this gospel
and
so we were made whole
when the sun rises
in spring
because the plants come out
after dying
so this is what I think saved
talking about
so this is
so now I'm just going to talk about hermeneutics
which is
hermeneutics is the science of
interpretation so this is what we've
been talking about the whole time
and this just basically explains
how basically
all the information I have
I try to
take it and look at it and say
okay how does this relate to
this belief how does this relate to this
belief
or you can go through the 5 W's
like
the preterist do which if we
had done that 100 years ago
we might be a lot farther
in our understanding of preterism
and eschatology
again so this has to do with
our due diligence
and I think all the information
is there it's just people don't want to do
it
it's hard to come up
with something that's true
when the obvious thing
is taken
literally
and basically taken at a glance
because people don't want to look like an
idiot and they'd rather follow
the crowd
so this is
why I think it could be
difficult for people to accept
astrothiology but
at the same time if we
actually show them that
no we've gone in and we've done our homework
then I think it'll be
easier for people to
listen to us and watch our
show and whatever
so back to this question
how do I know I'm not mind controlled
this is
the bite model
which this guy Steve Hassan
he's been studying
cults for 40 years
and
so he has this on his website
and it's
an acronym which is behavior control
information control
thought control
and emotional control
so the behavior control
has to do with rewards and punishments
right if you do this
you're good if you don't you're bad
so
this is maybe for kids
you would use that but
for full grown adults you maybe
don't want to use that
information control
you're
dividing the information from the
insider versus the outsider
doctrines
so I believe the Romans
16 17
sort of
shows about this
don't be divided so this is actually
versus talking about the new covenant
which shows that the old covenant
actually fits into the bite
model
in my opinion
so T is thought control
which is instilling
black and white us versus them
good versus evil thinking
right the tree of the knowledge of good
versus evil you just remember
that and which
led to figurative death
whereas the tree of life
leads to figurative life
and that study
with the time statements that
prove that this was figurative death
and
and how do we understand
these things well it reads like a mythology
at least
to me it does
but the
but nothing is actually black and white
if you think about it
because there's always more
to the story is what I've found
E is emotional control
which instill irrational
fears
of questioning or leaving the group
right if you leave this group
you're gonna get possessed by demons and go crazy
so they didn't say that about me
because they're very subtle
their approach was actually more
to do with information control
and to do with
it's like well
yeah you can leave but
I don't think like there's
these offhanded comments once in a while
if you don't keep the Sabbath day
I don't think you can go to heaven
and this was the church leader
whatever
and or they would use the verse
in 2nd Thessalonians
Jesus will come with clouds of fire
to those who do not obey the gospel
it's like and then they combine that
with a virgin person Luke that says Jesus
went into the synagogue
on the Sabbath
so let me ask
let me stop you there real quick just
because you finished Byte
you gave us a model for Byte
and the acronym
for the I
information control caught my eye
and
I guess you'd say there's more
extreme forms of information control
and then you have your not so extreme forms
but either way ultimately
they're cult related
you have minor and you have major
and something major like I was involved
in a group that was extremely
I mean like if someone else didn't
speak in tongues they didn't have the Holy Spirit
therefore you don't listen to them
also the only true
text was the KJV
the King James Version was wholly inspired
no other text was true
NIV was Satanic because
Jesus is called
you know
Lucifer the Bright Morning Star
and so is Satan or you know like so
there's all those connections so now you're in a cult
and you're going oh gosh and that's a major
to me to some form a major
information control
but to back up a little
right a Christian
who might be listening might go well
I'm not in that thank God
but are they checking out Hermes
Trismegistus are they looking at
Serapis are they comparing the religions
are they saying all of them
are telling us the truth
and that this is not exclusively true
are we researching all the
mythologies
exposing ourselves to all of these books
saying there's truth in everything
no well why
because Jesus is the only way
and you're taking this
book literal and they start
with the presupposition that they've got the answers
this is right and so in some
sense once again
they're still in a cult type
of mentality they may not
be in the extreme I'm talking about
originally but you see where I'm
going with this that that's exactly
right and I get emails
from
certain cult members
and and or
people who have family
members who are in a cult
and the person I'm
talking to has fear
because
their family member is going to
go to hell for being in a cult
well why do you why
do we have fear
in the first place why do we have a spirit
of fear didn't Jesus
free us from that doesn't
isn't there something there
and so
so it's again I like
what Luther you said about asking
the right questions
what is causing
fear and
should we be asking
about our the
doctrine of hell and how much
does Jesus explain this
and give us some understanding
of this matter
how does how much
information does
the New Testament give us
about the devil
and like Paul seems to
know all this information about
spiritual things why isn't he
talking about
how the devil is going to trick you all the time
why isn't there a letter on that
so
the main subject matter
you begin to realize I think
once you see the truth it becomes self evident
right
and I think it should be that way
it takes a long time sometimes
to go from a place of
this social influence
to a place of
realizing what's self evident
and has kind of been there
mostly all along
and like the New Testament is talking about
godliness that's pretty much
time he's talking about living
virtuously
so there's a little bit
of metaphorical talk
about this
the coming of Christ and
we get afraid because of
how we've been taught to interpret
some of this language
and we try to rationalize it because
the New Testament says test everything
and we think we're testing everything
so my question is
how much are you really testing
are you avoiding the scary doctrines
right if you still believe in hell
have you been able to explain that
and why are you
where is your fear actually coming from
because
and one of my favorite verses is
1st John 418 which talks about
whoever fears has not been made perfect
in love because fear has to do with punishment
well hello
are you afraid of
does God punish sin
or is he forgiving sin
well if you look at the zodiac
there's the children of night
and the children of light
or the day
that's Thessalonians
that's all cycles
his mercies are new each morning
so God is forgiving sin every day
Paul says I die every day
well I think that's the zodiac
the cycle of the day
he was lost
yeah
and
so
again this stuff becomes more
so it's a journey of course
and
understanding is something that takes more time
so this isn't I'm not
here to convince anybody don't agree with me
I'm here to say
go out and experience this stuff
if what you believe
if you're sort of in something that you do believe
just go 100%
in what you do believe
and test everything
because if you go 100% what you believe
you'll see where it leads to you
you'll draw the conclusions
of where that actually is leading you
gentlemen just a heads up we have 30 minutes
just giving you guys a heads up so
yeah
I'd like to key on something
this idea about testing everything
is super important
you have to think
outside of the box there are enough examples
throughout the Bible to be able to do it
however
we seldom actually do it
one that comes to mind
is my favorite character in all the New Testament
his name is Ananias
and perhaps you recall
Ananias
who witnessed to Paul
and this was
at a time when Paul was persecuting the church
he was
having them thrown into prison
and I'm sure he was directly responsible
for killing some of them
according to the narrative or at least the narrative
would have us to believe that
it is not the time you would think
if you buy that
old model where somebody's got to
suffer somebody's got to be punished
to think about
well what if Paul gets saved
I think I'll pray for him
I think I will
participate in Paul's
salvation
Ananias thought outside the box
at a time when everybody was saying
nighttime prayers
and God thank you
that you're going to kill Paul
amen
witnesses to him
even calls him brother Saul
which is so powerful it brings tears to my eyes
but he's thinking outside of the box
in love this is a love
that
is not
content with
the separation of itself
from creation
it is a love which eventually
swallows up everything
so that God is all in all
and I think that's the point of it
and we seldom
see that but I think perhaps that's
an example of it would you say
yeah that sounds right
I'm not super
like I know the story of Ananias
a little bit
just as it pertains to
some of the
I think it was the Holy Spirit
caused these people to die
or maybe that was a different
story but
there's examples like
that was a different
Ananias and his name was
Ananias too but this is the one that
witnessed to Paul
after Paul was struck down
on the Damascus road
the one that reached out to him
and you know the story is going to say
whoever it is that reached out to Paul
had to be some kind of Christian
because look how Paul turned out
yeah
I think it was a key story I'm thinking
yeah and that's again
the Bible is not just about
blessing you right
in America I think we've been taught
that we're just here to get blessed
by the Bible
a lot of this stuff is about
transformation
and it takes
work
and so
and it's actually
the Bible is teaching that unless
you have been transformed
you don't know
God
so you shall know them by their fruit
that's what the text is teaching
so how do we
discern
so sometimes
people the act are all
afraid or says in proverbs
I love proverbs
you can add that to your list of hermeneutics
but
it's like
well there's one verse actually
it says
answer a fool according
to his foolishness
and
you're basically
you're made a fool or it doesn't work
right
or if you don't answer a fool
according to his foolishness
basically it still doesn't work
because
because he's
he's not going to understand
so this has to do with having
enough knowledge
Hosea 4.6 says
my people perish for a lack of knowledge
and
we've been taught to be afraid or control
the information
because oh you might go to hell brother
or
astrology oh that's all
witchcraft
so
where do those statements come from
if we're supposed to be quick to listen
why do we say things like that
right
so there's stuff staring us in the face
in the New Testament
like let your speech be full of grace
with a sprinkling
of salt
and the salt is like
the truth it's a
you are the
salt of the world so it's all these metaphors
right
and I want to recommend this movie about
social influence
it's on Netflix it's called The Experimenter
and it's a film based on
the true story of the psychologist
Stanley Milgram
who did a some behavior
experiments and it's basically
to do with how people respond
to authority figures
and
if we have an authority figure in the room
they tell us to do something
usually we'll do it without questioning
the morality or the ethics
of what they're going to do
I think it's like two thirds of the time
which is
people don't like that information
they like to think oh I can choose
what I'm going to do
but
we have
to read authority figures
the same as us in a lot of ways
we're not so different
from a lot of these authority figures
even though they wear some like
scary clothing or whatever
it's
but because in this study
these people would administer
it was fake it was an experiment
but they would administer these electric shocks
to strangers
until basically they would have been dead
and just because this authority figure
said keep doing it or whatever
and it's very important
that you do this
and you can say this stuff very confidently
and people will be convinced
because you're convinced
anyway
and
you can look up Franz Mesmer
that's what I find most often
it's the emotional backing
of somebody who's once again
we're getting back to that concrete
psychologically there's a presupposition
concreted in the brain
it's grandma, it's mama
it's daddy, it's uncle
it's someone who
may or may not have
good intentions
but ultimately most of the time I would say
they're innocent in their approach
and they think they believe what is right
and what is true and it's just been passed on
but ultimately I think that
since we've been allowed or since the enlightenment
and people were allowed to read
and then it was kind of like
what we've experienced with slavery
in America
they made it illegal but it didn't stop
and it definitely didn't stop
the repercussions of having it to begin with
so it's taken a long time
it still has its elements today
so
the same thing for
with the control of the views
in the Bible
it's not too too long ago
that we were able to start reading this on our own
and
even then there were controls on what and how
you can practice and what you could think
look, everyone throws up John Calvin
and he burned
they burned the gentleman who didn't believe in the trinity
and
you hear these debates back and forth all the time
but there was always control
and even till recently
you start speaking out
there's riots that will happen
you're talking people who won't even allow you
they don't like that you're talking about it
we're careful about saying names on the program
I mean that's
it's being honest
so
it's being wise but this is the truth
because
because you can't freely
just go with the flow
I feel like it's getting better but it's
still got a hold of us man
yeah
and of course I have realizations
as I go as well
I thought I would at some point
stop
realizing that I'm inserting myself
into the Bible
but the more I talked to these
Israel only guys I realized I was doing it
all the time
and I was like
and they just kept having that realization
it was like well I'm inserting myself into this text
because
and I see it everywhere now is where people think
when the Bible says us
it was
it has to do with them
because they see themselves under this covenant
and they actually haven't studied
how that all works
or how there's like
seven different covenants in the Bible
so anyway
how many Philistines do you have to kill
right
so
audience relevance
I have to mention this
I hate to interrupt but
I'm finding more and more
truth in all of these views
it's not one
it's not just IO
there are elements of truth to all of them
and so I think me
and Luther and you were trying to figure out
how do we piece this stuff together
do we just throw ourselves in the text
how esoteric is the text
is the text so esoteric
that technically we are
Israel
or is it about a tribal people
is it about a people a place in a time
specifically
and the elements
of the esoteric teachings to them
also apply to anyone and all
so technically yes there's a story
a time a context for them but yet we can
attribute those esoteric teachings to ourselves
at what point do you draw the line
or do you take the full historical approach
which requires
a conclusion that IO is taking
because technically
if the historical literal approach is true
at the end of the day and Israel
is this biological tribe etc etc
but at the end it's all for them
and it all ends you see where the hermeneutics
and all the presuppositions all that stuff
can add up and make you draw these conclusions
and there's always
denominational differences where we started
with the show this is why because
I mean I don't
I don't know the answer completely
but I can tell you I'm being influenced
more in the esoteric route
based off more information
right yeah
the esoteric arises from the context
Derek you don't get it from the scriptures themselves
you get it
as well from how the scriptures
were produced what experiences
did these people called
Israel have in relation to
their conquerors in relation to
the various systems that they
encountered throughout their history
and so this is not
a sola scriptura approach
and Israel only very often
it's not the only one but it seems to be
you know we have a lens
that really doesn't go outside
of the bible to ask the question of
who wrote this and whose interests
is it serving
why did they write it what did they hope to
accomplish I think we don't ask enough
of those questions
yeah that's right because
that's the context
of the bible and
you can't know
where the metaphorical text
came from or even
what kind of metaphors
it is using
until you look at
the context and
the parallel accounts
of that in history
but Kevin that's what I'm saying
there's a literary context
which is many of us would agree
being exposed to Israel only
is Israel
but that's only one type
of context
you can't ignore the historical
and social and cultural
context that's very different
yes that's right
and like
unless you've tested
absolutely everything which is I
think is near impossible
it's like what does it mean to test everything
well
you're not even
accountable to do that
if you don't know
everything that's been given
to us about history
about the context
it's like
anyway
oh no Kevin
you're touching on something there too
and Luther you too good stuff
because you gotta ask yourself
who wrote it and why
I think that's gonna be an interesting question
we've been dealing with the historicity of Jesus
whether he existed whether or not
what's the probability etc etc
at the end of the day he may or may not have
it doesn't change what you Kevin
me or Luther think
it's just an interesting
cool intellectual discussion
at the end of the day though
if we find out
who wrote this manuscript
and why politically
religiously
in context
what you've been talking about with mind control
and how to get a better system
in place possibly
we might be going somewhere here soon
in another show
kind of giving a segue there so
yeah
you could definitely talk about this stuff for a long time
like I had
thoughts all throughout today
of stuff I would want to add to this
PowerPoint itself
because I'm almost
collecting these
psychological
where this stuff came from
and how to interpret these ancient texts
so I'm always thinking about this stuff
every day so
when I learned about the Zodiac
and
I've realized now
how much you can actually
interpret through the Zodiac
because I believe the ancients did this
and
of course they were looking to the stars
to be wise enough to know
where Christ came from his birth
so the stars are
the beginning and the end of everything it seems
because they would at the resurrection
they would go back to the stars
so this is a huge
part of the hope of Israel
if you're looking at in the historical
sense
even though it seems
to be condemned in some texts
again this has to do
with the different covenants
in the Bible and what is actually
producing the fruit of the spirit in your life
that's where you start
right
that's where I started
on my journey out of
some of this teaching
that I was only in there for nine months
because I saw what it was
doing to my family with my
relationships
with who it painted
God as
even though it seemed like he was a lovey-dovey
he almost had this dark side
and it was basically
if you
they actually taught that the way you receive the Holy Spirit
is to keep these feasts
well I read this verse in Luke
12 or 13
Jesus says if your child
asks for
a lump of coal
or asks for bread
do you give them a lump of coal
and there's like no
so
this is
the character of God
so this is the character of God
in their mindset to Israel
like God's not going to just do that
so
but that doesn't mean
this is exactly
who God actually is
to me this is like look at the nature
of how you're living
and where you came from
and how this universe gave birth to life
and humanity
and I think if you don't account for that
at least
then you're basically lying to yourself
about who God is
is it fair to say that
you're tying this into synchronicity
because it sounds to me
you can't
and this is another part of interpretation
I mean how can you say
you really understand what the Bible is saying
if you don't really see
how it's in every other text
even predating the Bible itself
you know your early church fathers
wanted to
apologetics wise defend
their historical church
their historical view at least
but what blows my mind is
for example everybody we've been in circles
with recognizing
the clear connection between Noah
and the epic of Gogamesh
scholars have noticed this for probably
millennia I mean this is
something that's been going on since probably
early on in the early church by someone
I guarantee you they've mentioned it
um
that being said
if you've got someone who says oh they understand
and this is the literal flood of Noah
and that the other one's not real
it's not true
that this one comes from that one
there's so many things
that should convince you to
look into this stuff
and I think you're right about the zodiac
I mean there's so many scholars who are saying
hey let's get back to what this stuff was all about
yeah
and the reason I talk about this divine nature
is it is the zodiac
like nature is in the zodiac
that's where it comes from
and if people don't see this
see the love
in the life that's around us
then
they're not going to be free to think for themselves
they're going to think
well I have to rely on somebody else to understand
the truths
instead of saying
no God wants me to have
a revelation of my own
right not just an echo
of somebody else's understanding
thank you
an original contribution
so
that's basically what I wanted to say today
don't just
look up definitions
go deeper
look up etymologies
and then you'll see how it connects to the zodiac
and the mythologies
you sounded like Miguel
Miguel
I'm plugging you a on bite
love from the water boys
but I have to say
Kevin what you just said
Miguel would say something like this
probably verbatim
well we have to create our own myth
okay
and Luther you have done such a great
job in showing
what that means what is a myth
and will you quote the gentleman
who describes myth verse history
for just at least tell us what that quote is
one more time Luther
sure Derek that's Bill Darnison
and he's quoting the Roman historian
Salist and he's also called
Salistius
but he says that myth is infinitely
superior to history
because while history happens only
once myth happens
all the time history
is true for a specific
circumstance but myth
is always true and with
everyone so we really
shouldn't be chasing after history and we
shouldn't be enamored with it because
in every way myth is what we
really want
myth will take you back to the esoteric
yeah and myth seems to be
the oldest way
of thinking for some of these
cultures that actually
these cultures we don't
have a good idea of
who they are we almost condemn them and say
oh they don't have our superior western thought
and
I think that astrothiology is
restoring some of this wisdom
that's been lost
in these cultures and mythologies
so
I couldn't agree with you more brother do you want
to conclude real quick before we get to our
conclusions
yeah so
yeah today I basically
I'll just summarize
like
you look at all these different contexts
and you can you realize new things
and the new knowledge changes what you
believe already it'll change your foundation
that you have now
like it changed maybe what you believe
10 years ago
what you believe now is different
and in the future it will be different
so we have to realize we're all growing up
in knowledge and the grace and the truth
and my
suggestion is to do that
sincerely for yourself
and trust your own
mind trust your reasoning
and then you can be
free to think for yourself because that's
really all you have
your thoughts or your own
sometimes they come in
from the outside it's your responsibility
to take that
and analyze it
and
to be slow to
speak or spread that information without
the proper context
and so
this stuff
mythologies go back before the bible
it probably goes back 40,000 years
with the zodiac the stars
have always been there so that's like a
big piece of the context in my
opinion
so I believe the humanity
is discovering that it's much
more united than it ever thought
it was and it's
going to have to adjust to this new information
it's going to be an inevitable conversation
as we discover it
I hope you have a wonderful day
and that we all realize we're
not so different
and I hope to do a lot more with you guys
there's so much more
that I want to share
but of course time is limited
and I have to
plan that for next time
hopefully
Kevin wonderful man
we really really are glad you came on
to share this
really
this is good
because I see myself in that as well
and I'm going to apply that myself
and you know
you can call it
karma
whatever terminology
we're biblically familiar more than we are
with anything else
but yeah for anyone who's listening
this stuff stretches way beyond
the walls that we once thought were there
I mean
it is beautiful
yeah and I'm excited
for the future
let's just say that
I'm excited for the future too Kevin
and you have reminded us
just how interconnected
we are
you know we see it
we should acknowledge it
with things like the internet
and being so far into the quantum physics age
but still we're operating under this illusion
of separateness
and separateness is not sustainable
we see that more and more
so
what I got out of what you're saying
is he
wide open
Marvin Simmons is a preacher
I first listened to I think in
2005
and he said in his gruff voice
and I think he preached in Canada
if I'm not mistaken where you live
he says you got to read your bible
with your mind wide open
yeah
and be sincere authentic
doctrine
can hurt
don't even think about doctrine
and for them very often
it's the silent killer
they go to church for other reasons
or they're in religious groups
because hey
relationships or how it makes me feel
and I've done research on this
because my advanced degrees
in social psychology and reasons
why people attend church
and some of it applies to cults too
and it's to feel like a family
the church makes me feel a part of something
or I have young children
who need to be instructed
well that's fine
but also
what's the basic outlook on life
what are the teachings that go on there
we're not just there to feel good
we're there for a much
deeper purpose
and thank you Kevin for helping to
point us in that direction today
I love it
you're welcome
thank you brother
