I want to tell you a story that was well known in antiquity from Homer and I'm going to let you
guys decide why you think I want to present the story in this way. Odysseus has been away from
home for 20 years and his house is in trouble. It's infested by suitors, over a hundred of them
with their slaves who want to marry Penelope and Telemachus is powerless. He doesn't even remember
his father. He was an infant in arms when Odysseus went off to fight and he says,
I'm told that I'm the son of my father but I have no idea. So Athena tells Zeus I'm going to go
down to Ithaca and I'm going to empower Telemachus so that he can do what he needs to do against
the suitors and Hermes is going to go to Calypso and get Odysseus freed from her island so that
the father and the son together can meet back in Ithaca and solve the problem of the suitors.
Now to do that Athena flies like a bird down to Telemachus and nobody else sees her except
Telemachus and then she says to Telemachus my gosh you look like you're dead and she says well you
know people say that you know I'm like my dad I know that I'm his son and she says no you definitely
are and you what's going on with these bums in your halls they're eating you out of house and home
he says yeah I know they are but I want to empower you to do something you really are the
son of your father and he was a mighty warrior in the Trojan war and the possibilities are he's
still alive and I want you to go to Pelos and to talk to Nestor and then Menelaus and Sparta
and find out if your dad's coming home then Athena leaves him flying like a bird and goes back home
then Telemachus is empowered and he's going to take the his estate back from these people
but he's got to fight off these this controversy with the suitors that will kill him if he's
it if he's too aggressive the gospel of Mark Jesus is a young guy he's baptized by John the
Baptist and the spirit like a dove flies to him and says uh here's a voice that says you are my
beloved son what happens after that the spirit evaporates and he goes to Galilee he goes home
and says the kingdom of God has arrived but first he has to go through the temptations
in the wilderness by the devil and this is a part of the Rankin stuff you have a hero who is a young
man he's virtuous and so on and then he has to slay the dragon or he has to win the princess
or he has to swim the ocean or he has to kill the monster defeat the sphinx with a riddle
this right so you have this this pattern of proving yourself now he proves himself by
not accepting all the prerogatives he now has as the son of God you know casting you know making
bread out of stone and casting himself from but he prefers he's the son of God but he calls himself
the son of man and he disguises his identity in Mark because he doesn't want anybody to know
that he's the secret identity the secret identity because if the opponents find out who he is they're
going to kill him and that's what happens at the end now this is not directly an answer to your
inquirer but it's to say that even the the Markin account is mythological even the the story of
Jesus's baptism is mythological and it's already in Q and I think Q is already using this model
by the way the model is the same model for the Buddha the Buddha is a rich young man and he
finds it intolerable that you have this suffering in the world and he gets rid of his wealth and he
goes through this difficult time and then he gets enlightenment and he comes back and he's a teacher
so this appears in world religions but it also appears rather spectacularly in the Odyssey and
it's important for the the the general narrative so to the person who contacted you and us I would
say already in the Q document or or at least by the time of Mark you have this heavy mythologizing
of the young hero now but that doesn't have anything to do with Nazareth and by the way
Matthew and Luke both agree in spelling it as Nazirah not Nazareth yeah now there are different
interpretations of that and Mark Gudeikinari talked about it according to the Q hypothesis
they have them the the same nomenclature because they're both using Q and Q has that spelling
according to the far hypothesis Luke knows Matthew so he has that spelling and that probably
would can be congenial to your hypothesis about Nazareth in my reading there's reason to think
that Luke has reversed priority at a number of points with that narrative because it is a it has
stronger mythological parallels to the Odyssey than the others and this is an example of how
mimesis criticism and the synoptic problem and the problem of the historical Jesus collaborate
and dovetail and make things very complex yeah so I hold to this historical Jesus I think even
Mark has heavily mythologized Jesus to make him a a consummate innocent adopted hero by the way
Octavian is an adopted son of Julius Caesar and right and he becomes Augustus
and then is the the primary ruler and so some people have suggested and I think it's not bad
that Augustus the most venerated of the early emperors was an adopted man
and that Julius Caesar could consider to God and so he was Devephilius he was the son of God and so
on so these things become very mythically complex and politically complex so we're trying to
I think my contribution is it that very few people try to link Jesus narratives to the Homeric
epics and those narratives that are so important in understanding ancient religion and that doesn't
mean Jesus didn't exist but it means that the processes of mythologizing him began very early
what if we take the story of Jesus going back to Nazareth right and rejected by his own people
and then he goes to Capernaum and apparently goes to Capernaum and calls disciples and that's the
following the Luke version now what happens at Capernaum at Nazareth when he goes home
where did this guy get his wisdom and power and that the suitors are saying the same thing
where is Telemachus getting this courage and and why does he think he has this authority
don't we know I mean and then the question is his paternity don't we or his family don't we know
his family and so on and Jesus can't get any help out of his own family well that's what happens
with Telemachus he's in his own home he can't get any help from there and he has to go off
and he sails in a ship that is supplied by Athena in order to go and and and find word about his
father what happens in the the gospels Jesus calls fishermen to have a boat ready for him
to sail the sea of Galilee uh when he goes on the so these these echoes are not just echoes
they're mimetic strategies to place the story of Jesus in one of the great contexts of a a
youngster becoming to his own having being encouraged by knowledge of his father claiming his
kingdom suffering in order to get it done and then getting it done ladies and gentlemen join
