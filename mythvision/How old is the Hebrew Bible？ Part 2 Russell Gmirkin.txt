Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy this show with Russell the American. This is part two of his book series
Roses and Genesis Manito in Exodus. Was the Hebrew Bible created during the Hellenistic Age somewhere around 300 BCE?
That's pretty late in the game. Let me know what you think and don't forget
Please consider becoming a patron member of MythVision. It helps me in my endeavors and getting these scholars on to teach that general public
There's also one-time donations you could do to my PayPal, cash app, whatever down in the description. Love you guys
We
MythVision, welcome back to MythVision podcast ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna be talking about
Hmm the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible if you will the Septuagint the 70 if you will this Greek version
Is I guess you say up for debate a lot of people disagree the Jews argue about this stuff
Historians are arguing scholars talking about the documentary hypothesis about when the Hebrew Bible was collected and its various
Sources, you know JED
P and and all those different sources and how they were compiled and what we're gonna look at today is Russell
American's work in his book
Borosis and Genesis Manito and Exodus
Hellenistic histories and the date of the Pentateuch and then of course he's the author of Plato and the creation of the Hebrew Bible
I did things backwards
I started with the the latter book and then now I'm working on the other one his initial book that he had released in
2006 so I want to ask you guys a few questions before I bring our guests on are you interested in the dating of the Hebrew Bible?
Most scholars believe the Hebrew Bible was constructed hundreds of years before the Septuagint
Sometime around Ezra or Josiah using history or graphical reasoning and believe it was made up for a force sources the JEDP
Documentary hypothesis
What if the Hebrew Bible wasn't as old as we suppose in this series of videos that we're gonna discuss here about his book?
Russell American will give us a case where the Hebrew Bible was developed say five minutes before so to speak before the Hebrew or the
Septuagint Greek translation was written in Alexandria
Could the Hebrew Bible be a Hellenistic work? Are there problems with the documentary hypothesis?
We will wrestle with this in Borosis and Genesis Manito and Exodus the first chapter
We talked about was methodology and history of scholarship chapter two was the documentary hypothesis and today
We're gonna deal with chapters three and four and with that being said welcome to the show Russell American. How are you sir?
Just great pleasure to be here
I'm glad you're joining me again. We took a pretty deep dive and a lot of people really loved our last episode
We dove into some of the scholars that are in the documentary hypothesis field
We talked about historiography why people late date it
They kind of trust the book to say what it says almost like if we didn't really delve into the critical method
You're using for example. We might get stuck
Like assuming Daniel's writing when Daniel says he's writing
But because a critical scholarship we can see what the author of Daniel whoever he is using the pen name of Daniel
Is writing much later and this is you know using critical method
But what you're doing is even more on the empirical evidence type side of saying here's source material
We have the earliest that we can go. We're trying to find what is the earliest evidence we have of a
Law code written by Jewish people or written for Jewish people and you do that really really deep in chapters three and four
So I would talk first of first and foremost is Hecateus of Abdera chapter 3 is the title
I must say up front the issue will come down to the earliest sources
We have about Jews from certain historians the dispute over what it what they mean and where they derive their ideas gets greatly discussed in this
Video using a minimalist approach based on evidence and writings about the customs of the Jews
Can we really say that the Jews have or had a Torah Pentateuch prior to the times of Manito?
Hecateus etc seeing how strange the figure Moses is by the sources discussed as you're going to see in this video
Is there any reason to trust that a definite tradition of Jewish Jewish laws customs were organized into the Jewish people's worldviews at this time?
When did these books get written for the Jewish people and finalized so to speak the reliance of Hecateus of Miletus
Herodotus and Hecateus of Abdera on native Egyptian priestly oral sources is striking. Wouldn't you say Russell American?
Yeah, that they they all named Egyptians as their sources and yet
Hecateus of Abdera and
Well, he mentions the Jews or Judah, but he did
evidently not have any Jewish sources because what he writes about is
Pretty imaginative and unrelated to the Bible. So the question of is he working with Egyptian and sources?
Jewish sources or no sources at all. It's a it's a critical issue
And I bet there's a lot
Yes, so you've really framed this as well and please proceed
Okay, so I'm gonna I take in notes as I've gone through the books. So ladies and gentlemen, please have patience as I continue to read this
But this is important. I
I'm telling you you're gonna enjoy this if you're into this kind of stuff
You know wondering people and I'm just gonna give you a little tease
Josephus claims that the Jews come from Egypt that they're
Hixos, you know, he runs off of this tradition. It appears now
It's much more complex than what I'm just saying here
But you got to scratch your head and wonder well, why does scholarship say they're Canaanites and not Egyptians?
Well, I mean Egypt did reign that the area of Canaan for a whole thousand years or so or more
So there may be something going on here, but we're gonna see a serious issue coming on
So I'm gonna go ahead and read some of this stuff and correct me if I'm wrong in pronouncing stuff
Theos theo fratis or frostus. I'm sorry theo frostus. Is that correct?
Yes, he was a student of Aristotle. He was more or less the successor of Aristotle and a very prolific writer
And he does he mentions Jewish practices
Well, in serious yes, he he says that they
Worship their God at night and had burnt sacrifices and he gives us a little a
Teaser about what is known about customs in the area at that time
What time is that and that's important that we just kind of nail down a time right here with this guy
I
Right well Aristotle
as
many people know he was the teacher of Alexander the Great and
He
Was a contemporary of Alexander when Alexander was conquering the whole
Eastern world between about 325 and 323 BC and
Theos Rastus a little bit later than that. We'll say oh
320s 310s BC
So he lives in a time when the Greeks were starting to learn about
The Near East because they were there because they were conquerors and they started bringing in information
That they wrote about to their contemporaries in the Greek world
And so we get little drips and drops of information about
The Eastern area and including the region of Judea
From what I understand
They did
If Theo Frostus if I'm saying this correct
He mentions Jewish practices of astrology that like you said at night, but also human sacrifices might have been a thing
If that is going on
Which I love you take this moment in in the book to mention like if that's going on in 310
BCE they're already they're still practicing human sacrifice and strange sacrifices like that
You know you mentioned in the book, but we don't really have any evidence if these are like
Sumerian, you know Jews if these are Hellenistic
They don't really mention anything, but that this is a custom that they were known to do is
You know commit themselves to their own to a sacrifice. This is something that they would do they self-sacrificed
Yes, you know for us just found human sacrifices, especially important, but he also
believed animal sacrifices were
Kind of kind of wicked kind of
Barbaric some other philosophers who believed in reincarnation
They were even more abhorred by animal sacrifices because you might be eating a relative who had been reincarnated
But that's just an aside
Yes, Theo Frostus talked about sacrifices with with honey and
burnt sacrifices at night and
the people observing the stars and
Kind of odd customs that don't quite conform to what we see in the Jewish Bible
But it's one of the first discussions of religious practices in that area
in any source
So I want to get some names out
We got Manito, which was an Egyptian priest, which is in the title of your book and he says that Moses was like
Osoricef
One who sided with the Hixxos shepherd kings
Manito like Hecateus of Abdera knew of a figure named Moses associated with the Jews
But there's no evidence that Manito read or knew of the existence of Jewish writings. That's correct. Yeah, so
Manito wrote two accounts
That kind of sound like the Exodus one of them were was about the Hixxos which were a
Group of foreign invaders who ruled Egypt for a while and destroyed the local gods and they were eventually
Driven back into Judeo where they
Founded the temple of Jerusalem and
basically these Hixxos or shepherd kings were
thought to be the founders of
Ancient Jerusalem and Judea and their temple then later on there was a second similar
problem in Egypt where a
Priest of Seth Typhon named Osor Seth
He led a band of lepers and rebels and brought the Hixxos back in and he was terrible and he
Bought us the other Jewish together Egyptian gods and he was also driven out of Egypt as well
the Egyptians had
traditions were periodically they would have to expel foreigners and
Horrible people who did bad things to the Egyptian River religion and
Expelled them back into
Syrian Judea and the Northlands
Well, Manito said that some people in his day
They said that this second character Osor Seth was the same as the person
Known as Moses that they were the same individual. So there's a very slanderous
accusation against
Moses who was
the law giver of the Jews, but
Manito didn't get that from any Egyptian sources though. He was just saying that some people
There was an oral report that some people were saying that this person
Osor Seth who was in the Egyptian literature
Was the same as this Jewish character Moses. So
Manito didn't have any
Jewish sources
About Moses and we'll later discuss that neither did hectares of Abdera
So you have a couple of counts that in written in Greek that mentioned Moses
But have nothing to do with the Bible and
As we will also later discuss I consider these
references to Moses to be pre Biblical before the books of Rose Moses were written as
part of the Torah I
Think this is important and I say
Right
I'm sorry. I was gonna say that the the the reason why I think this is fascinating is
When and you have to picture this I had a hard time doing this
But just imagine go three four hundred BC, right?
Nothing prior to that for matter of fact for those who are watching nothing prior to that has any evidence
There's no evidence that
There's a Moses character that there's laws given to the Jewish people
So in his minimalist approach scholarly speaking from the Copenhagen school, which is known for minimalist scholars
They're coming at this saying look we need not just to use, you know, histori historiographical stuff
We want what is the what is the oldest?
We can find a physical evidence or something that really gives us some roots to stick into the ground and say hey
This is when not speculative
Hypothetical knowledge like you might get from the documentary hypothesis and so I want you to know
We're gonna I'm gonna mention a few facts that he's written here as we go
And then he's gonna elaborate of course on these some of it's a little long-winded, but it's powerful
And correct me if this is right mega mega Stina's writing after the time of Borosis
Viewed the dues as a Syrian race of philosophers compared to the Brahmins of
Indian I think that's interesting for some of our guests who want to make a comparison like oh
It doesn't India possibly look similar to the Jews and they're they're priestly type ideas
And yeah, there seems to be some connection or at least he's saying he viewed them similar
I think that's interesting another side note. Some of these authors are
anti-Semitic appears so
Manito
Doesn't seem like he's very cool with the Jews. He doesn't seem like he likes them that much
It's why he's writing a kind of a derogatory
History on these people
Others have shared similar ideas
We're gonna mention them and I'd like if you don't mind saying yeah
He's definitely not pro and then others who aren't really that big against them
And I think that's important to point out as we get into the history of this true. Yes, so
Yes, and around 400 BC we know
from the elephantine papyri
that
They had no traditions about biblical writings or Moses or mosaic mosaic laws or
Not working on the Sabbath day or any of the things that you would expect if the Bible existed
So that's clear down to 400 BC
Where flat-out
Contemporary evidence that they dug out of the ground in Egypt
Says that the Jews didn't have any biblical writings
and then
Then you get into the Greek period after Alexander conquered the east and
For the very first time you get a couple mention about
Judea in Greek sources and a couple mentions of Moses
but they also don't appear to have anything to do with the Bible or the books of Moses and
Eventually in this
Session we're going to find out that the very first definite
Objective evidence of the books of Moses was the Septuagint translation
As late as 270 BC
So we're talking about a couple earlier authors
I could KSF of Darrah around 315 BC and Meneath around 285 BC
They mentioned Moses, but they don't know anything about
Jewish traditions or the Bible. So we really need to deal with that if we're going to find what is the first?
Authenticated evidence that these books of Moses existed
That's a good point
Okay, so
Okay
sporadic references to the Jews began to appear in Greek literature starting with Herodotus
This chapter begins with a survey of the earliest Greek authors who mentioned Palestine or the Jews in order to discover whether any
Demonstrate knowledge of Jewish writings prior to the Septuagint translation
Hegateus of Abdera is of special interest since a passage not to have been authored by Hegateus quoted from the Pentateuch
Is quoted from the Pentateuch most of the chapter will be concerned with whether the passage in question is in fact a hegatean
Fragment in this preliminary survey of early Greek notices of the Jews
Hegateus's place will be considered as one of the sequence of a sequence of Greek authors who mentioned the Jews among the earliest Greek
pose writers Herodotus circa 425 BCE knew only of
Phoenicians and Syrians of Palestine some of whom practiced circumcision
Having learned this custom from the Egyptians as had the cult the Colchians
I believe I'm saying that correct for it is plain to see that the Colchians are
Egyptians the Egyptians said that they hold the Colchians to be part of
Cessosterous army the Colchians and the Egyptians and the Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first
Practice circumcision the Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine
Acknowledged of themselves that they learned the custom from the Egyptians and Herodotus or Herodotus of Syrians may
Excuse me may have been identical to or at least included the Jews although Herodotus did not know them by this name
So it's interesting. I just want to point out on the practice of the heart of Judaism circumcision
We know that the Egyptians have done this for a very very long time prior to the Jews
So this practice, I just think it's interesting when people are so
There's so much presupposition
There's so much baggage and there is a lot of anti-Semitism that's happened
But I find those who are Jewish or are biblically minded
They think that this is anti-Semitic to even suggest that circumcision going on for a long time
Egyptians have been doing it long before the Jews and the Jews may have borrowed this from another nation that kind of undermines the idea to them
God gave this special
Circumcision covenant, you know to Abraham as if it's unique is separating him them from other people by circumcision
Think about it. If Egyptians have been doing this for a long time as well as multiple other
Cultures and that they might be late in the game on practicing such a practice, you know
What's that do doesn't it doesn't prove the dating of the Septuagint, but it does kind of suggest that this practice is being
Utilized later in history if that makes sense
yes
recently I've read an article that discussed Egyptian circumcision and
It showed a couple pictures of inscriptions that showed Egyptians
actually conducting
circumcision's
You know, so it's there inscribed in the stone. It's pretty objective evidence
You probably don't want to post a graph, you know a graphic about it on your show
It's there in the
archaeological and inscriptional record as a certainty and
Definitions who lived along the coast of the mediterranean coast just
just east of
Modern Israel and Jordan and whatever
You know, Herodotus knew that they practice circumcision
so it is not something unique to the Jews and
Pretty much all historian
ologists
Recognize that it's not controversial
Except for people who maybe are a little bit limited in their reading and
take
the biblical account as
100% historically factual
Yeah, you're gonna find that script is don't lie
You said that good. Yeah, you're gonna find that problem a lot with
Especially when you look at the fragmentary evidence how strange
The source material is that he's working with here in chapters three and four of the book
Which you really need to get the book
He's spending quite a lot of time taking a deep dive this chapter is quite longer than the other ones that I read in his book
I'm trying to show you like some of the sources that are being used and
Are they pointing to an earlier tradition? Is this something that you know comes from something earlier?
Anyway
Egyptians were clearly the sources behind the
Nationalistic claims that the Jews were colonized from Egypt and learned circumcision from the Egyptians
Neither Herodotus nor Hecateus of Abdera claimed to have consulted the Jews rather the Egyptians were regularly
Cited as authorities throughout
Diodorus book one now here
We're gonna get into something interesting and
Diodorus book one thought to have drawn heavenly on Hecateus of Abdera
Hecateus of Abdera appears to have drawn exclusively on Egyptian oral sources
Supplemented by Herodotus for his knowledge of both the Egyptians and the Jews
He knew the Jews only as a country colonized by Egyptians from whom they learned to practice circumcision
It is also noteworthy
That Hecateus of Abdera treated that both Egyptians and Jews favorably in line with the pro-Egyptian
tendencies of the Egyptica, so
We're gonna get in and I guess I could probably jump a little here
The book one of Diodorus and there's also the book 40 and they don't line up
starts to get really
Complicated or at least appears
One is pulling from a different source and the other one is pulling from another one book one is pulling from something that's more
Optimistic and and favorable to the Jews that they were colonizers that Egypt Moses quote-unquote was a colonizer
Moses came from Egypt as a
Colonizer he's just going out and they're conquering new locations and building their place and their people and he's
Bringing principles and laws and he's establishing stuff in Judea
Mind you not like the biblical account says where Moses comes and he's got a tabernacle. He doesn't have a temple
There he's obviously the lawgiver, but he wasn't in Judea. He was in the wilderness
So the tradition in the Bible is not the same as the tradition that all of these people
Prior to your Septuagint are drawing off of there. They're they're not even close. So can you elaborate on that?
Yeah
in Diodorus's library book one
That material is
Nobody disputes that most of that came from Hecateus of Abdera
That's just pretty much cut and dried and he had
He wrote a book called the
Egyptica or the on Egypt the history of Egypt and he was very patriotic about
Egypt which had just been conquered by the Greeks and
So it's just a bit of propaganda in it and he portrayed the Egyptian
As having colonized vast areas of the world
they not only colonized Judea and
Venetia and Syria
Which
Hecateus said could be proven because they all practice circumcision like the Egyptians so
But they also colonized Babylonia
and they colonize
different parts and in
Greece really all of all of Greece was Egyptian
originally Hecateus was saying that all the Greek customs
and Greek gods came from Egypt and
So he it was a very
pro-Egyptian view of
glory Egyptian past and
It came from Egyptian priests who wanted to
promote their ancient civilization as
grand and amazing
Kind of compensating for the fact that they just been conquered by the Greeks. So they were
They were living their glory days of the past and
This Moses story is just one of this collection of largely fictional tales
was
Did the god
Bellas or
Bell Mardic did he really come from Egypt and colonized
Babylon and give them their laws and customs no
dead Deneas really
Found found the Mycenaean cities of Greece and established Greek customs
No, and
The same with Moses he didn't lead a colony of Egyptians into Judea and
Found their temple and give them their constitution and laws and customs and priesthood
It's just as fictional as his other patriotic stories and a
Lot of the features of this story that Hecate has told about Moses
It was a typical Greek foundation story
Greek foundation stories it was
They were very stereotyped. They'd have
the gods
appoint an expedition leader and he'd lead his colonists to a new land and
There they'd write the constitution and laws and religious practices
and establish the temple city and capital and
All of this is very
stereotyped Greek fictional foundation story material and
It contradicts the Bible wildly
So we know that this story
doesn't come from
the Bible the only two points in common is that the exhibition came from Egypt and
It was led by this mysterious figure Moses whom we've never heard before
from any source in Greek
Jewish or otherwise
Maybe the name Moses came from the Egyptians because
It might be the same as the Egyptian word for water. It might be related to
Ramses which is like raw dash Moses
It's kind of used as a part in some known names
So maybe the Egyptian priests did feed
Hecateus the name Moses, but where they get that from is a complete historical mystery
and they certainly didn't get it from the biblical account because
The story hecateus tells just doesn't resemble the Bible at all
Yeah, I totally agree with you
I wanted to go ahead and read the the reconstructed foundation story if that's okay in its totality
to spare everybody reading it piece by piece because
Once I read this you guys can hear this story directly from the horse's mouth and then understand keep in mind the biblical story
right the one we have that has been there supposedly from the start and
listening to this source right here which
Predates the Septuagint that we have or at least in some respects is supposed to predate
Because there might be it might be drawn from multiple sources that some are later and some are earlier
But that I digress because you go into that and that's really critical. All right
So here is hecateus is reconstructed foundation story. It reads as follows
Starting in 3.2 B and the most outstanding and active among them banded together
Journey to Greece and certain other regions their leaders were notable men chief among them being Denaeus
But the greater number settled in what is now called Judea
Which is not far distant from Egypt and was at that time utterly desolate the colony was headed by a man named Moses
Outstanding both for his wisdom and courage on taking possession of the land
He founded besides other cities one that is now the most renowned of all called Jerusalem
In addition he established the temple that they hold in chief veneration
instituted their forms of worship and ritual drew up the laws relating to their political institutions and ordered them
he also divided the people into 12 tribes since this is regarded as the most perfect number and
Corresponds to the number of months and make that make up a year
He picked out the men of most refinement and with the greatest ability to head the entire nation and to point to them
Priests and he ordained that they should occupy themselves with the temple and the honors and the honors and
Sacrifices offered to their God these same men
He appointed to be judges in all major disputes and entrusted them the guardianship of the laws and customs
Their lawgiver was careful also to make provision for warfare and required the young men to cultivate manliness
steadfast steadfastness and generally the endurance of every hardship
He let out military expeditions against the neighboring tribes and after annexing much land a point
Apportioned it out
Assigning equal allotments to private citizens and greater ones the priest in order that they by virtue of receiving more ample revenues
Might be undistracted and apply themselves continually to the worship of God the common people were forbidden to sell their individual plots
Lest there be some who for their own advantage should buy them up and by oppressing the poor classes bring on a scarcity of manpower
He he required those that dwell in the land to rear their children and since their offspring could be cared for at little cost
The Jews were from the start a populous nation such as the account of Hegateus of Miletus
And I don't think you meant to say Miletus but in regard to the Jews
yeah, yes, that's um
that is the story that appears in
deodoris library book 40
section three
And it's a composite a composite account. It's got several different threads in it
One thread is negative that said that
um
these people were the colonists were a problem in Egypt and
Another part is
Very positive and then there's
We have a little bit of Greek mythology thrown in there with Deneis being
an Egyptian
Prince who
went to Greece and founded a nation there
and
this is a whole mix up of
of sources in
in in this passage one interesting thing is that
Some of the details come from Plato from Plato's laws
who
described a theoretical ideal nation
Uh, which he said would be composed of 12 tribes
one for each month of the year
with uh rotating duties
and
He also said that uh, he described a class of
Pre priests that were called
The nomo phylai keys or the guardians of the law
That also appears in this passage. So
Um, Hecateus of Abderai, he knew about Plato. He knew what an ideal
nation looked like as described by Plato
and so
He used a lot of he used Plato to uh, kind of beef up his story and uh make this egyptian colony
Ideal
So that his Greek readers would see what a wonderful nation
and
Moses found it in Judea
Yeah, there's seems to be customs in here as well
Which what you've done is you dissect this this entire thing
I just read you dissect it all through chapter 3 diodorus syculus library 40 and showing that you know
Breaking down like for example, their customs appear to be in the source very egyptian with respect to marriage
Towards foreigners like the idea that they call um, uh, xenophobia or the idea that they're they're not allowed to
marry outsiders and there's
exogamy exogamy and um
The idea of foreigners towards foreigners very similar to the egyptians
But you mentioned in your ladder book that that idea is also very similar to the athinians
So it's not just an egyptian idea
As well as burial of the dead now the burial of the dead and raising children
Greeks were known for
You know having children and kind of letting them be like stray dogs on the streets
So to speak and they were okay with a society like that whereas
The egyptians weren't if i'm not mistaken
um, yeah, the customs very varied around the world and um
There are certainly some echoes
of egyptian customs in this passage
And and greek customs as well and a lot of a lot of it really didn't reflect
local or judean customs
so
Scholars in the past have suggested or thought that well this mentions moses so it must come from the bible
but
the problem is
None of it resembled the biblical account and there's lots of foreign elements in it. Uh, so
My book was really the first to analyze this passage and show
Yes, i mentioned moses
Yes, i mentioned 12 tribes
But that does not come from
Uh, the book of exodus or or or the penitent
It's uh, it's an independent imaginative greek story
and if anything
the biblical account biblical account
Shows awareness of hechateus
And not the other way around the bible is borrowing from this
first story of moses colonizing judea
That appears anywhere in world literature
That's the controversy right there guys, so
That skips ahead for example
Josephus claims
That phylo and it's not just a josephus because after reading chapter four. This was interesting
I have jews today that you know i've heard our previous episodes who
Some people are just so extreme and they take you as an anti-semide or
You know what i mean?
There's people who like jump to conclusions because you're critical and you're just looking at this scientifically
But then there are those who are like no no no and they're apologist just like i think the
Egyptica is is definitely an apologetic work for the egyptians
um what we have is
They're being apologist and they're saying no no no no no no no no nice try phylo Aristotle everyone everyone
You name it
They're all borrowing from the bible not vice versa and josephus tries to do that and say that these people were
You know borrowing from moses and the laws of god from our book because we have the truth and ours is right
They're all wrong that matters. I just want you guys all to understand that
It's a 50 50 chance it either borrowed one way or the other so you got one way or the other you know um
That knowing whether it did or didn't can make a world of difference on the conclusion
I really want you guys to keep that in mind at the same time
um
There were some writers and maybe i'm skipping into chapter four here a little bit but um
There's a let me read the the intro to chapter four because this is important and what you're suggesting on trying to explain
Where this comes from?
Once i read this intro, um
You know i'd love to hear more what you have to say and you can go anywhere you want to take us uh russell
But anyone who's listening if there was a source with the bible
All right, that was there already existing
There would be no reason why they wouldn't draw from that source
There would be no reason why this source wouldn't have quoted that
Uh, it would have said you know something it had drawn from the source. It doesn't source any of it
At all so this is an argument from silence
Don't get me wrong doesn't prove anything
Uh, but it doesn't help the case i'm saying there was a source already around it doesn't
There's no reason to say this is evidence for a source like some people do so chapter four
There are however three intriguing illusions to a greek translation of portions of the pentatew prior to the septuagint translations
So there's illusions to this greek prior to the septuagint. These are references in the pseudopigraphical works
Pseudo hecateus to a scroll of jewish law in the time of hecateus in the fragments of
Aristobulus, I believe i'm saying that right to the exodus the conquest and the laws of the jews in a greek translation
Predating the septuagint and in the letter of erasthias to jewish scrolls written in hebru and to a defective
greek translation of the pentatew proceeding the septuagint all three of these translate
Tradition sorry date to the second or first century bc and must therefore be used with caution
No fragment of a greek or hebu precursor the septuagint exists
so the existence
Of jewish pentateuchal or proto pentateuchal writings prior to the septuagint is hypothetical at best
Yet the late references to jewish writings predating the septuagint deserves serious analysis and evolution
It's just a lot of material
The the bottom line is
the first definite
Evidence for the books of moses and the pentateuch
Is their translation into greek around 270 bc that's just
Undisputed we know there had to be
Books of moses written in hebru in order for them to be translated into greek
And we know that it took place around 270 bc
But there are rumors. There are later rumors
that there were uh, there was an earlier
defective
translation
Of all parts of the books of moses
Into greek and that's the reason why they had to do this septuagint to correct this bad defective earlier translation
But
Nobody has actually preserved the translation
and
It's in written in sources that are very specific
and
What what i discussed in chapter four is that there's evidence
that
What this earlier defective supposed translation into greek
was
Is that story of
The real hackatase of abdera that we just heard the one in the egyptica
Where he basically presents a fictional account of moses leading a colony of egyptian
Into
Judea and founding their temple and laws
So you have that story that does exist before the septuagint translation
And a lot of people knew about that story
And these people assumed
Well, this is
This is must be a really defective
distorted
error film
failed version
of
The books of moses someone must have taken the books of moses and made a really bad translation
Where all of a sudden moses
Didn't die in the wilderness
He he went and founded the city of jerusalem
Established the temple and all of that stuff. So
So these later writers they're desperate
For evidence that the books of moses are really ancient
They they scoured all of greek literature for any hint or clue
That there was an earlier mosaic tradition
And all they found was
hackatase of abdera
With this fictional story
that they
said
Must
Prove that there were earlier jewish writings that mentioned moses
So that's basically the argument i make
In chapter four of my book that you can discount these rumors of an earlier
Books of moses because it was all based on this
this story
by hackatase of abdera
I think it's interesting because
It it tells me how desperate someone has to be if and he shows us in his book showing you the sources that are quoted and whatnot
Uh, that these sources that come later. Uh, let me give you a few examples. Um
Aris Aristopulis
Aristopulis
Quote-unquote maybe
Yeah, maybe 150 bce
It sounds like a jewish author
Uh, is it an agree?
He says in a greek pentateu predate in the septuagint. This sounds like a jewish author the way he argues
For example, here's a quote from him or whoever this author is
It is evident that plato imitated our legislation and that he had investigated thoroughly each of the elements in it
Fred had been translated by others before
Demetrius
Filarious, I think i'm saying that right before the conquest of alexandria and the persian think about how far back this
He's going the parts concerning the exodus of the hebrus our fellow countrymen out of egypt
The fame of all the things that happened to them the conquest of the land
And the detailed account of the entire law were translated
So it is very clear that the philosopher mentioned above plato
Took many things from it for he was very learned as was pythagoras who transferred many of our doctrines
And integrated them into his own system of beliefs
But the entire translation of all the books of the law was made in the time of the king called
philadelphia's your ancestor
He brought great zeal to the task then his predecessors while demetrius
Filarious managed the undertaking. I think it's interesting to note there and you can tell me what you think is important about this quote
but
To me it's just funny how he's making like
Pythagoras is borrowing
The jew's story and their laws and incorporating their story in their laws
Josephus is doing the same thing later on and it makes me wonder if he's reading if josephus is reading
Aristopolis or some of these guys coming up with this idea
Yeah, um, Aristopolis said that all sorts of greek writers
borrowed from moses
Home were borrowed from moses the great law givers solen of athens
Who founded the first athenian constitution?
Some of his laws were very similar to the biblical laws
and
well
Moses couldn't have borrowed from solen because moses lived a thousand years earlier
So solen must have borrowed from moses. Uh, that's the logic that they all followed
So solen he he copied from moses who was the earliest and most
distinguished
law giver in the ancient world
and
Plato
There's a number of laws and platos
writings
In his last work called platos laws
That greatly resembles the loss of moses
so
He must have known about
The books of moses too and he must have copied mosaic laws
And Pythagoras
He had some anything that resembled
The books of of the penitouk at all or jewish doctrines
Aristopolis
He attributed to
All the foreigners borrowing from the ancient jewish writings
um
Somehow i mean this is this is the most ironic of the list
somehow even uh even
Homer
Borrowed from the books of moses when homer was
He was an oral poet. He didn't even
They didn't even have an alphabet in greek
In greece during homers day
and yet
These guys have homer copying from moses. Evidently he could he could read hebrew
And somehow we get a hold of all these hebrew books
at a time when
Greeks were pre-literate
so
You know you can
You can take all of these claims with a very liberal pinch of salt
You know the lid the lid might actually fall off the top of the salt shaker
on on on these claims
um
but uh
jewish writers including ersta
And as you point out jocephus later on they were uh very enthusiastic in their claims
that
That the world borrowed from jewish
traditions
And i think they saw the strength which is fine. I know
Yeah, I was just gonna say I think I
It's like apologists today when I talk to christians today who want to see when we talk about comparisons between jesus and other mythologies, for example
there's this
Instant defense from apologists to try and point out like a lot of them will jump to the conclusion and say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no these myths borrowed from uh, jesus
Not the other way around and the because there is a strength
In that argument like what that does to your narrative what that does to your literature and the genre of your literature and what
How true is it literally?
All of that makes a big big change when you realize who's borrowing from who who's paying the pied piper on this situation
and um
you know i'm not closed off to the potential of
um cross-cultural, you know giving and taking of ideas
um
But this right here seems to be some strong evidence suggesting these things like let me ask you about ezekius
I think i'm saying that correct easy e k i a s
this is um supposedly a real historical person we have coinage of
Back in the 400s b c e
but um, he supposedly journeys to egypt in
Pseudo hecateus if you will his pseudobrographical writing about hecateus
How did these writers keep um coming up with an exodus from egypt and why is that something?
We're going to probably have to get into later on and through this series as we dive through this book
um, yeah, I think so um
Yes, ezekius who is uh, that's probably the uh
um
Judean high priest
Hezekiah is basically the actual hebrew
name underlying this
Yeah, he allegedly came to egypt and brought a scroll of
Jewish traditions and
read it
in front of all of his
compatriots in egypt and it told the whole story of
The uh exodus or their settlement and their
political constitution
and
This is kind of a
of
a little bit of a fictional story because that was a very common custom in
In alexandria that's someone who
wrote
a literary work
Would gather maybe the king and other philosophers and writers
and he would uh, he would read this poetic or literary work to them and then they would
You know applaud him and the king if and it was a big prestigious situation
and
pseudo hecateus
um, he claims that uh high priest
Uh
Ezekius did such a thing in alexandria like 400 bc
But but of course everybody everybody knows i that is all scholars recognize that uh this
Person that josephus claims as hecateus
Was really a much later
Jewish author writing around
Or i forget 100 150 bc
So they call him pseudo hecateus and uh, they all recognize this his story is
Is pure fiction and that these events never took place
He he claims to be the real hecateus of adera and that uh
And that uh, he knew about
the high priest
reading this
These books of moses and alexandria
And that's how hecateus learned about all these egyptian customs and about the exodus story
so
pseudo hecateus is
Trying to come up with this fictional background for how the heck did hecateus learn about the exodus
and
it's very creative uh tail, but uh
You know scholar scholars don't give it any credibility
I i appreciate that i mean just just pointing this out because
As we said earlier on in the show
There were many um anti-semites. It appears they were definitely people who weren't fond of the jews one of those
You're going to find out later on i think manito is one of those especially comparing
the prophet moses the law giver moses with that of a
apostate
um egyptian priest and
That that whole comparison is pretty intense. So I can imagine in this type of thing where there's competing
cultural backgrounds and whatnot
You're trying to come out on top
And so you might be trying to in especially during this time when you have someone like play dough who's saying
The older story the more true really like tenure gives everyone more truth
So it kind of reminds me of that story about in play dough with ala. Um, i'm sorry not alex. Um
What atlantis, you know, uh, he supposedly says well, we greeks know of one one
Destruction narrative and he says oh you should know we we egyptians
We know of three human catastrophes. You ever heard of the story of atlantis?
There was a pretty simple as it you know what i'm saying like whoever has the oldest story
seems to be
the truest or
Has the biggest
I guess you'd say if your military your rank tire in a sense they view that tenure and time as something more powerful
And so they're trying to reach their way back in time to try and place themselves older than they were
Am I wrong in that?
No, that's true. Um
And
Not long after the conquest of alexander the great
um
You get all sorts of nationalistic histories by various people
uh that are
um, they're all apologetic the
um
The egyptica of menatho the the egyptian priest
It was talking about the glories of ancient egypt and the uh,
Babylonica by burrow says the uh, babelonian priest is talking about how
great babelon was in ancient times
and um
mcassanese wrote the indica which talked about the glories of the ancient
civilization of india
and
The jews wrote their
history of judia, you know from genesis to kings and
um
It was also very
nationalistic in the sense of
Talking about the glories of the past
It was a prestige thing
uh, I think
Jaeger who called it the war of books
Every nation in the east that had been can conquered by alexander the great
They each produced a book of their history and how great they were in ancient times
In fact, all of them said were much older than the greeks even uh, they're they're newcomers and
Our civilizations were much more glorious
so
You know everyone was doing that and um, you know, if you're a conquered people
then
It's not it's natural that there'd be some
compensation that you try to find some pride and in your
In your heritage and that's that's fine
um
So yeah, they were all they were all apologetic. You know everybody was back then
So let me ask you this and this is a little side note honor was an important thing
Yeah, oh, I agree. I agree totally. Um, and I could see that happening
You mentioned in the previous episode we did on elephantine papyri. Is that the what is the oldest evidence?
Of jewish people period that we know of
um
Well, the oldest evidence of
Jewish people would be an inscription
Right, there's a reference to the land of juda in about 735 bc
um
Where an assyrian king called tiglath pileser the third said that uh, he conquered the region
And uh, he received tribute from the king of samaria
And he also received tribute from
the land of juda
And this is the first mention of juda
as a geographical area
Uh as a kingdom as a people has anything
in uh an ancient history
And after around 735 bc you you start
Hearing a mention of the kingdom of juda in the syrian records
There's a mention of hosea. I think unless he was from israel
Certainly hezekiah and and the later kings so from about 700 bc on we know that there's
A kingdom called juda
that that is uh
Where the jews come from
Uh, but no earlier than that
Thank you. I just figured out i'd you know get you to kind of clarify that
um
For those of you who are interested in the dating of the jewish writings, he has a couple diagrams
He gives in the bulk on the septuagint. He goes into the kumran texts
uh samaria
uh, the astronomical book of inoc and sudo uh,
upalemus
uh, the book of the watchers and juda
Demetrius the chronograph
Chronographer egypt now these are all dating right there in the 200s bc
Um, which the septuagint is the oldest of all of these but that there was a continuation of literature that was developed after that
We have no evidence prior to the septuagint
of any
writings of these things and so
um, i'd like to just close out the last chapter or the last paragraphs of chapter four if you don't mind and then
We'll have a little i guess quick q and a and in the show
There's no external evidence whatever for the pentatube or any writing written precursor of the pentatube prior to the septuagint translation
Even when such evidence would be expected under the documentary hypothesis
Rather one only has evidence as late as circa 400 bce of what wellhausen called
oral Torah
That is an authority vested in the jerusalem priesthood
Rather than in a written code of laws
The first evidence that the jews attributed their laws to a figure called moses appears
And hecateus of abdera's egypt egyptica
320 to 315 bce and we already talked a little bit which we're gonna get
We're gonna get into manito later
But we already talked a little bit about how this doesn't look like the biblical story at all
fictional
But this book does not yet provide evidence for the existence of actual books of moses
But with the septuagint the pentatute appears full blown in its present form
The absolute silence of external sources prior to the septuagint translation
Regarding a written jewish law
Contrast with the proliferation of jewish writings using the pentatute following on the hills of the septuagint
The result of this analysis is that the septuagint translation gives a true
terminus ad quem
for the the pentatute
The evaporation of the commonly perceived terminus ad quem evidence in hecateus of abdera is especially significant
For it opens up new possibility of literary influence on the pentatute from sources after hecateus in the period 315 to 269 bce
It is only the shifting of the pentatutes terminus ad quem to circa 273 269 bce
That allows the consideration of potential terminus quo evidence
From literary works between the time of hecateus and the septuagint translation as the following chapters demonstrate
Several greek words from this period had a substantial impact on the pentatute notably
Borosis and beneath them which we're going to get into that
um
real quick thing
Russell uh
The translators of the septuagint for those who are wondering when this was actually taking place when they translated it
They in rabbinic tradition mentions has it that the greek Torah
Uses or used short-footed instead of rabbit
How does this help with the dating potentially offending the patalamies?
I always say patalamies. I always say peatalamies. Um, how does this affect the dating the whole changing of the word?
Well, um, okay
Alexander the great
Conquered the east from egypt
All up the coast all of asia minor persia all the way to india
after his death
His empire was broken up
and
one of the
Kingdoms that it resulted was centered in egypt in the new city of alexandria
and
The first king there was king ptolemy the first
Ptolemy was one of alexandria's generals and he was known as
Ptolemy the first legis
Where legis means rabbit
um
And later on he kind of changed his name to ptolemy the first soda
um
Where soda means savior because he saved the island of roads from an invasion
um, he didn't much like the word rabbit
because
rabbits were known as
extremely promiscuous
um
I think they have the reputation clear to this day for their
sexual
activity
Which is rather frenetic
Shall we so?
the torah
And and the toman mentions this it avoids any word
rabbit that
Possible in in in the greek translation included
Because they didn't want king tolemy and uh his successors to get mad at them
He they were known to uh
Not be very forgiving towards their enemies one poet wrote a a a ski thing
epigram about
I think it was
Ptolemy first legis it could have been
um
His son Ptolemy philadelphia's
But anyway when they caught up with him they put him in an iron chest and threw him into the ocean
so they
Uh, you didn't really want to be insulting towards the Ptolemy's
so the fact that
The satuagent translation very studiously avoids the word rabbit
That points to it have it having been translated during the time of
the
Ptolemy early Ptolemy dynasty including Ptolemy legis
That
That they didn't want to offend and so it's a chronological indicator
Yep, it places it fairly early and uh, it's one of several indicators that it was translated around 270 bc
Didn't his wife or something and that means?
Um
Yeah, his wife was um
He was she was involved with uh accusations of sexual improprieties too
um
I haven't read. Oh, yes
What's interesting is the explanation that this is because Ptolemy's wife was named rabbit
Um, right. She was she was a legate. She was uh
Her her surname is that word was legus. So, uh
Yeah, his uh, tolemy
The second philadelphia
Which was the son of the original original?
Ptolemy legis
Her his second wife was uh, our seno the second
Uh
legis and so
um
she was extremely sensitive towards insults and uh, she was probably behind
uh, that person being tossed in the ocean and so, um
So it's thought that it was within her lifetime that the septuagen translation was made
Wow
Goodness gracious don't crack any jokes around them. Okay. Don't don't even play games, you know
Um, is there anything in specific in chapters three and four of your book that you would like to make note before we end this episode
your your voice is giving out and it would take uh
We'll probably take some walking on water or splitting the red sea to make your voice come back
But um, is there something that we should make note of before we move on in this series to the next uh
points you drive home
Well, I just want to kind of summarize
that
Clear through the end of the persian period and alfam and elephantine papyri
There's no reference to mosaic writings
And then clear down to the septuagen translation
itself
There's no
Jewish writings. There's no mention of moses. None of that
But right after the septuagen translation
Um, there's what I call an explosion of Jewish writings
Uh, you mentioned some of them the book of watchers
Demetrius the chronographer
Just all over the place
Everybody knew about the jewish bible and the books of moses
after the septuagen
But not
at all before that
So that's a powerful indicator. Um, that uh mosaic writings simply weren't known earlier
uh, the other thing I want to mention is um
I'm just finishing up a new book called, uh
Plato's Tamaeus and the biblical creation accounts
and uh
In this new book that's been accepted by rot legend. I'm just finishing editing right now
I uh argue that, uh
Both genesis one's creation account and also the story in genesis two
Which is considered as a separate creation account. I really isn't they both come from
Plato's
book that he called the Tamaeus, which was his, uh
account of how the universe came into existence and how
A monotheistic cosmic creator
designed our beautiful cosmos
so
Genesis one and two and three come from this
Plato's Tamaeus
well
Septuagint scholars have noticed that
The septuagen translation of these chapters
Contains a lot of language that also comes from Plato's Tamaeus
So you have
the Hebrew version
Which comes withdraws on the Tamaeus
And then the Greek translation
Contains additional vocabulary that comes from Plato's Tamaeus
And
I'm I will be arguing in this book that's coming out
This shows that the authors of genesis and the books of the Pentateuch
They were also involved in the translation
Because we know both of them were using Plato's Tamaeus. It's a really it's a real smoking gun
and uh, and it verifies my
um
my thesis that uh
That and uh, Alexandria the same group of people were writing the books of moses and then immediately
You know five minutes later translating it into greek
So, um, anyway, that's my last comment before my vote voice. Give that entirely
Look guys gals get the books. Uh, he's got two of them out. I can't wait for this next one
This is great. Um, you left me with a great cliffhanger. I can't wait to see what you bring here
Um, you know guys, what do we do? What do we do with the documentary hypothesis?
What do we do with the dating of the pentateuch the aura? What do we do with this stuff? I can see why
people who just take um,
Maybe some archaeological evidence like rustle mentioned earlier
You know, we can show evidence of the earliest time that the Judean kingdom is mentioned in the 700s bc or
Assyrian and potentially Babylonian sources all this stuff. Well, if there are people, why don't they have writings?
I mean, lots of these people have religious rights and stuff
They should have writings to equate that they had practices versus meaning they have to have a
A legislative book of writings is not the same to act like oral traditions and oral civilizations
Must in effect have writings because later on we see them with writings doesn't mean we have to
force that back onto this time
I think a lot of scholars are suggesting maybe this is what's going on and they might have good reason
So keep diving into the documentary hypothesis and diving into his thesis and consider what he's saying
Um, plus you have historiography, you know, do you trust the book to say it was really written in the time of joe sya?
This book is written
Do you really buy that it was written when those times are or you will in the scientifically test it and poke holes and see
When is the terminus ad quim if you will forward these texts? So russell, thank you so much for this
um, this is episode two of the series on
Porosis and genesis manito and exodus and we might make this a five part series
It's going to take us some time to get through but it'll be worth getting through
So anyone who doesn't can't afford the book or doesn't come across the book
You get quite a bit of the information here on this series. Thank you for joining me very welcome
And never forget we are
meth vision
