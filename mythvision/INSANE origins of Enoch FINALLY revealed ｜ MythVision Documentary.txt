Ascent of Kings
Diving into the ancient texts of Mesopotamia is like embarking on a scholarly quest
for the ultimate cosmic library.
Imagine chatting with the deities who drafted destiny itself across the sky.
What mind-bending secrets could you uncover from such celestial scribes?
This journey isn't just a fanciful tale,
it reflects how the old-time intellectuals of Mesopotamia dreamt of knowledge,
and how their dreams evolved.
Were the heroes of these narratives humble shepherds, mighty kings, or wise sages?
What profound transformations did they undergo?
And what treasures of wisdom did they bring back to earth?
And how did their stories morph over time,
popping up in spells, or being retold in fresh, intriguing versions?
Understanding these heavenly expeditions is crucial,
not just for grasping how these ancient scholars
viewed themselves in their long-standing Cuneiform tradition,
but also for seeing how they adapted to a newer, more diverse,
Aramaic tradition shared with Jewish scholars during and after the Babylonian era.
At the heart of this exploration are questions about the nature and content of this intellectual
exchange. For instance, while some researchers studying Aramaic texts see the legendary Mesopotamian
King and Miduranki as the archetype of cosmic knowledge gained from a divine voyage,
a serialogist often spotlighted Adapa and the Apkalu as the true models of celestial wisdom.
The concept of a heavenly journey and its revealed knowledge
held profound significance for Mesopotamian scholars.
This documentary offers a fresh analysis of Mesopotamian texts and iconography
related to the ascent to heaven, tracing its evolution from the earliest to the latest sources
and placing them within their historical contexts. Previous studies have often focused on specific
aspects, such as literary interpretations of the Adapa myths or theories regarding
Enmeduranki and Enoch. In contrast, this video aims to provide a comprehensive historical perspective
on how Mesopotamian scholars themselves conceptualized and engaged with the idea
of heavenly ascent in both theory and ritual practice. We'll explore the various depictions
of the heavenly journey that were prevalent during different periods, particularly during the
Babylonian and Second Temple periods, and examine how scholars of those times adapted and invoked
their inherited texts and themes under new historical conditions. The narrative of Mesopotamian
traditions concerning heavenly ascent reveals a shift from a focus on kings, epitomized by early
myths and references to the celestial journeys of figures like Etana and the Ur III Kings Shulgi,
and Ishbi Era to a later emphasis on sages and the transformation of royal power into
scholarly ritual. This transition reflects a broader evolution in the way knowledge and divine
interaction were conceptualized, moving from the domain of royal power to the realm of scholarly
pursuit. Through this exploration, we aim to understand not just the imagery and ideas associated
with heavenly ascent, but also what these concepts meant for the scholars who pondered,
wrote about, and enacted these celestial journeys. Adapa emerges as a central character in Mesopotamian
lore, symbolizing the zenith of heavenly journeys within their scribal culture. His story is referenced
in a striking variety of at least 34 texts spanning from the Old Babylonian to the Hellenistic periods,
initially appearing in the Old Babylonian Era circa 1894-1595.
BC, the myth of Adapa's ascent to the heavens, marks a seminal shift in the narrative of celestial
journeys. As time progresses, especially in the first millennium, the narrative of Adapa gains
prominence while earlier figures like Etana recede into the background. From the outset,
Adapa is not just a mythical figure, but an active presence in the rituals of exorcists
who invoke or embody him during the Old Babylonian period. As the centuries unfold,
his significance only grows. By the first millennium, Adapa is not merely a sage,
but a symbol of ultimate judgment and skill, invoked repeatedly by scholars and kings alike.
This marks a significant evolution from the earlier heavenly ascents, which were primarily
undertaken by kings seeking to establish dynasties. By the Neo-Assyrian period, it is the scholars,
not the kings, who embark on these celestial journeys, seeking not just power, but profound
knowledge and ritualistic prowess. The narrative of Adapa further evolves after the rise of the
Persian Empire and the cessation of native Mesopotamian kingship. He transcends the purely
mythological and ritualistic spheres, stepping into the historical and political arenas as he
is featured in king lists and monumental inscriptions. This evolution of Adapa's role
from a mythic figure to a symbol invoked across various domains illustrates the dynamic nature
of Mesopotamian intellectual and cultural traditions, reflecting a deep-seated belief
in the power of knowledge and the scholarly pursuit of truth and order in the cosmos, Etana.
The Ascents of Kings section begins with the tale of Etana, one of the earliest and most
captivating stories of celestial ascension from the ancient Near East. This Sumerian king's
legendary journey was not just an adventurous flight to the heavens, but a quest driven by his
desire for an heir. He embarked on this perilous voyage aboard an eagle, seeking a mystical plant
believed to bestow fertility. The narrative intertwines with a moral folktale of an eagle
and a snake. Initially, allies, the eagle betrays the snake, leading to its own downfall.
In its time of need, Etana offers salvation, and the grateful eagle repays this kindness
by becoming his steed to the skies. Interestingly, evidence suggests that
Etana's story might have been a popular folktale even before it was chronicled in written form,
as early seals depict scenes reminiscent of his journey. However, when the tale is finally
put to tablet, it becomes more than a mere adventure. It symbolizes the divine right and
the continuity of kingship. Etana's quest for celestial aid is linked with the legitimacy
and perpetuation of his rule. Beyond the myth, Etana's legacy continued to evolve.
In various rituals, yet as the first millennium BCE unfolded, Etana's presence in literature and
ritual began to wane. Despite the occasional copying of his story during the Neo-Assyrian period,
references and ritualistic invocations of Etana significantly diminished,
signaling a shift in the cultural and religious landscape of Mesopotamia. This decline in Etana's
prominence marks the evolving perspectives and priorities of Mesopotamian society,
where once celebrated tales and figures could fade, giving way to new ideologies and icons.
The Etana myth, with its vivid depiction of a king's heavenly ascent on an eagle's back,
resonates beyond its Mesopotamian origins, sharing similarities with a range of stories from classical,
Persian, Islamic, and even 20th century Finnish cultures.
This widespread motif of a hero's flight underscores a crucial point about the nature
of ancient narratives. They often transcend their immediate cultural and historical contexts,
echoing universal themes and motifs. Such parallels highlight that while narratives may
appear similar, literary resemblance alone doesn't necessarily indicate a direct, historical,
or cultural connection. The Finnish and Islamic versions of this motif, for example,
can be described in ways that closely mirror the Mesopotamian account, reminding us that the
significance of a narrative is not just in its content, but in what it meant to the people who
told it and heard it over time. The Etana story stands out in early Mesopotamian culture, not just
for its narrative content, but also because it's reflected in the art of the period, particularly
in Akkad period seals. These seals provide the earliest visual representation of the myth,
depicting a consistent and detailed scene.
A pastoral setting where men are engaged in making cheese, a man ascending to the heavens
on an eagle, and two dogs along with shepherds witnessing this extraordinary event. The presence
of this scene on seals indicates that by the Sargonic period, the story of a shepherd's celestial
journey was not only known, but also popular enough to be depicted in everyday objects.
This visual representation, coupled with the narrative, offers a richer understanding
of the myth's place in Mesopotamian culture, suggesting that it was more than just a story,
it was a shared cultural touchstone that spoke to universal themes of aspiration, exploration,
and the quest for divine wisdom or intervention. Etana's first written mention in the Sumerian
King List, dating back to the Ur-3 period, situates him in a unique historical and mythological
context. Positioned as the Eleventh King after a great flood, he follows a series of rulers
with seemingly mythical names, such as Kulasinabel, which translates to all of them are ruler. This
suggests a pre-monarchical era, or a time of diffuse leadership, rather than a single sovereign.
In this lineage, Etana is the seventh king of the second series of rulers,
marking a significant transition. He stands out as potentially the first real ruler,
amidst the preceding mythical names, signifying a shift toward a more historical and recognizable
form of kingship. His characterization as a shepherd aligns with the pastoral origins of
many ancient Near Eastern societies, and symbolizes his role in guiding and unifying his people.
His most distinctive act, ascending to heaven, further elevates his status, intertwining his
earthly reign with a divine or supernatural aspect. This ascent not only underscores his quest
for personal solutions like seeking an heir, but also symbolizes his extraordinary qualities as a
leader capable of transcending the earthly realm and interacting with the divine. Through this
narrative, Etana becomes a foundational figure, representing the melding of myth and emerging
historical consciousness in early Mesopotamian civilization. Etana, a shepherd who went to heaven,
who consolidated all lands, became king and reigned for 1500 years. Bali, son of Etana,
reigned for 400 years. Sumerian kings list. Etana's heavenly ascent, whether tied to the
origins of kingship or his quest for an heir, as recounted in later versions of the myth,
underscores his unique place in the Sumerian king list. As the seventh king of Kish, he aligns with
other significant figures like Adapa and Meduranki, who are also often positioned as the seventh.
In their respective sequences, a number that may carry symbolic importance,
denoting wisdom or a special connection to the divine. This placement in the list
reflects a synthesis of narratives. Etana, the shepherd, and Etana, the founding king,
emerged into a single figure, a unifier, and a pioneer of kingship. This merging also indicates
an expansion upon the older story depicted in the seals, blending Etana's pastoral roots
with his regal, mythic ascent to the heavens. The myth itself is known from texts spanning the
Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, and Neo-Assyrian periods. Each offering variations of the story,
the existence of these different versions across time, doesn't necessarily indicate
a linear evolution of the narrative, but rather points to the existence of parallel additions
and interpretations reflecting diverse scribal traditions and cultural values.
In the Old Babylonian version, the myth is explicitly linked to the origins of kingship.
This connection perhaps serves to legitimize and exalt the concept of monarchy by associating it
with a divine or supernatural journey, implying that the institution of kingship
has heavenly approval or origins. This narrative choice highlights the enduring significance
of Etana's story in Mesopotamian culture, not just as a mythic adventure, but as a foundational
legend that helped to define and understand the nature of kingship and authority in the ancient
world. The great gods, the Anana who decrefate sat to deliberate about the land, the creators of
the world, the establishers of creation, the Divinely Gigi decreed the festival of kingship
for the people, but a king they had not yet established among the many peoples. At that time,
headcloth and crown were unworn, nor was scepter inlaid with lapis. Not a single throne dios was
built. Sevenfold were the gates bolted against the valiant scepter and crown. Headcloth and
staff lay before Anum in heaven. There was no ruler for the people. Kingship came down from heaven.
Ishtar looked for a king. Text breaks. Old Babylonian Kings List.
In the Old Babylonian rendition of the Etana myth, he is depicted as the inaugural king,
diverging from the sequence presented in the Sumerian King List. This version
places a clear emphasis on Etana's adventures, marking them as the narrative's central theme.
A significant line in this version echoes the language of the Sumerian King List using the
phrase, kingship descended from heaven. This phrase not only links Etana's story to the
celestial origin of kingship, but also reflects the belief that sovereignty itself is a divine
mandate embodied in sacred objects of ritual and political importance that reside in heaven.
Under the watchful eye of the god Anum. The text mentions gates bolted seven times,
symbolizing the barriers between the earthly realm and the divine right of kingship,
awaiting a worthy ruler to unlock them. By the time of the Neo-Assyrian Nineveh version,
the text reflects deeper contemplation and reinterpretation by scribes. This version introduces
additional lines that preface Etana's selection as a ruler. Etana is once again referred to as a
shepherd, but the term is employed as a political metaphor, suggesting a herder of people rather
than just sheep. This metaphorical language was a common way to describe kings, implying their role
as guides and protectors of their subjects. The Nineveh version seems to deliberately play
with both the literal and figurative meanings of shepherd, suggesting that Etana transitioned
from being a literal shepherd of sheep to a metaphorical shepherd of people. The evolution
of the text over time, from the old Babylonian to the Neo-Assyrian periods, indicates that
scribes continuously engaged with and reinterpreted Etana's story as their own conceptions of kingship
and sovereignty evolved. This ongoing reflection and adaptation highlight the dynamic nature of
Mesopotamian literary and cultural traditions, where ancient myths were not static relics,
but living narratives continually reshaped to reflect the changing values, beliefs,
and political realities of the times. After Etana is made king, he faces a personal crisis.
His wife is unable to conceive due to an illness. In a dream, however, she envisions a plant of
birth that promises fertility. Etana, desperate to find this mystical plant, prays to the sun,
God Shamash, to reveal its location, just as it was shown to his wife in her dream.
This sets the stage for Etana's quest and intertwines his fate with that of two animal
companions, a snake and an eagle, who form a pact under the watchful eye of Shamash. The oath
they swear is sacred, enforced by the threat of divine retribution should either violate it. The
curse specifically mentions being denied entrance to the mountain land, a crucial area for hunting
and thus survival. However, the eagle betrays this trust, consuming the snake's young in a cruel
breach of their agreement. Seeking to escape the inevitable revenge, the eagle conceives a plan
to ascend to the heavens. The betrayed snake, seeking justice, turns to Shamash.
The god advises a cunning trap in the mountains where the snake can incapacitate the eagle,
stripping it of its ability to fly and casting it into a pit. In its misery, the eagle too calls
out to Shamash, who, in a turn of events, decides to intertwine the eagle's fate with Etana's.
Meanwhile, Etana is in a state of despair, having exhausted all his resources and offerings in seeking
Shamash's aid for his predicament. He laments the extensive sacrifices he has made, indicating his
deep frustration and desperation. Shamash finally responds to Etana's prayers,
instructing him to follow the same path to the mountains that the eagle had taken.
This directive sets the stage for Etana's and the eagle's paths to cross, linking their destinies
and propelling them towards the charred goal of reaching the heavens.
Through this intricate interweaving of human and divine, animal, and supernatural,
the myth of Etana explores themes of betrayal, retribution, desperation, and the pursuit of
redemption and hope, all under the gaze of the gods who guide the fate of all beings.
The encounter between Etana and the eagle in the mountains becomes a pivotal moment,
a literal answer to their prayers. As Etana rescues the eagle from the pit and aides in
the repair of its wings, the story delves into themes of restoration and mutual dependent. The
eagle, once a powerful creature of the skies, now requires the help of a human, possibly even a
specific substance, Yeru, that shares a name with the word for eagle to regain its ability to fly.
Similarly, Etana, a king on earth, finds himself in need of the eagle to ascend
to the heavens on its back to obtain the plant of birth, hoping to cure his wife's barrenness
and secure his lineage. The narrative cleverly plays on the word Yeru, creating a linguistic
and thematic link between the eagle Yeru, the substance possibly needed for its flight,
and the concept of fertility and pregnancy, also Yeru. This linguistic play adds depth to the
story, highlighting the interconnectedness and interdependence of all elements within the myth.
However, the path forward is not straightforward. Etana implores the eagle to open his eyes and
locate the plant of birth, but the eagle admits ignorance of its whereabouts. The solution to
their dilemma comes through divine intervention. The eagle receives guidance in a dream, a common
motif in Mesopotamian narratives, where dreams serve as a medium for divine communication.
The dream reveals that their journey is not to the wilderness or earthly realms,
but to the heavens themselves, where they will seek an audience with a goddess.
This revelation sets the stage for the next phase of their adventure, where the earthly and the
divine will meet. The story of Etana and the eagle becomes more than a quest for personal gain.
It's a journey into the unknown, a test of faith and courage, and a quest for divine wisdom
and intervention. The Nineveh version of the text, reflecting later, Neo-Assyrian understandings
and interpretations, continues this tale of aspiration, desperation, and the hope of divine
benevolence, capturing the imagination and spiritual yearnings of the Mesopotamian people.
The eagle spoke up and said to Etana, my friend, that God showed me a dream. We passed through
the entrance of the gates of Anum, Enlil, and Ea. We bowed down together, you and I. We passed
through the entrance of the gates of Sin, Shamash, Adad, and Ishtar. We bowed down together, you and
I. I saw a house with windows, a seal I pushed aside and entered. Seated inside was a young woman,
awesomely crowned, her features beautiful. A throne was set up and the ground was trodden
down. At the base of the throne, fierce lions lay. As I approached the lion's sprang, at me,
I started up in terror. The narrative of Etana's ascent to heaven
intriguingly parallels another famous Mesopotamian journey, the descent of deities like Inanna,
Ishtar, and Nurghal into the Netherworld. Both journeys involve traversing through seven gates,
a number often associated with completeness or the divine in ancient Near Eastern symbolism.
This symmetry is not just a narrative device, but a reflection of the Mesopotamian worldview,
where the cosmos is mirrored above and below with heaven and the underworld,
serving as dual realms of divine encounter and transformation. The oath sworn by the snake and
the eagle underscores this parallel, while the phrase Narebshadu directly refers to the
entrance to the mountains. The word Shadu also connotes the Netherworld. In Mesopotamian belief,
a spirit-denied entry into the Netherworld is condemned to wander the earth in torment.
Etana and the eagle's journey to heaven involves passing a Nerebu, a threshold similar to the
gates of the underworld. By juxtaposing Nereb Shahu, entrance to the mountains or underworld,
with Nereb Shamei, entrance to heaven, the narrative emphasizes the contrast and connection between
these cosmic realms. The story also highlights the prophetic nature of dreams in Mesopotamian
culture. These dreams aren't just personal experiences, but are often laden with broader
cosmic or divine significance. References to Etana's death and his afterlife as a Netherworld
hero further complicate his character. A fragment of the text speaks of his ghost, a death like
Etana, suggesting his journey and fate resonated beyond his celestial ascent,
perhaps becoming a metaphor for the human condition or the quest for immortality. This
aspect of Etana as a Netherworld figure persists in literary references outside the ascent myth.
Highlighting his multifaceted role in Mesopotamian mythology as both a celestial voyager and an
underworld presence. The Etana story's meaning to its ancient readers likely varied,
reflecting its multiple versions and interpretations over time. This multiplicity
suggests that the narrative was flexible, adaptable, and subject to reinterpretation,
based on the changing needs, beliefs, and context of the audience and the scribes.
Internally, the text itself provides clues to its evolution and reinterpretation. For example,
the late version's introduction implies that the old Babylonian version was either misunderstood
or deliberately rethought, indicating a dynamic relationship with the narrative. The text was
not static. Instead, it was a living story, continually reshaped to resonate with new
audiences and integrate with other mythic themes. This practice of rereading and rewriting
suggests that the story was significant enough to warrant such sustained engagement and adaptation.
The introductions to the text also offer insight into how it was intended to be read.
They emphasize the themes of the First King, the founding of kingship, and the heavenly origin
of kingship. This indicates that the story was seen as foundational, not just as a myth,
but as a narrative with political and cultural significance, linking the institution of kingship
directly with the divine. Externally, Itana's roles and representations in other texts highlight
his multifaceted significance in Mesopotamian culture. In the Sumerian king list and the
ballad of former kings, he is portrayed as a primordial king, emphasizing his status as a
foundational figure in the mythic past. However, he also takes on a role as an underworld ruler
in various funerary and incantation texts, as well as in the standard Babylonian version of Gilgamesh.
This duality suggests that Itana was seen not just as a historical or mythical ruler,
but as a liminal figure navigating between life and death, earth, and heaven.
The divinization of Itana, indicated by the use of the divine determinative in writing his name
in the late version, further underscores his complex status. He joins figures like Domuzi
and Ningish Tzida, who exist in both heaven and the underworld, and Gilgamesh, who narrowly escapes
death only to become associated with it. These associations suggest that Itana was seen as
more than a king. He was a symbol of the human quest for knowledge, power, and immortality,
and the ways in which these quests intersect with the divine and the afterlife.
Itana's primary role within Mesopotamian scribal culture was that of a legendary founding king
celebrated for his daring adventures and his significant position in the underworld. He was
a figure whose narrative extended beyond the realm of mythology and into the practical and
spiritual aspects of Mesopotamian life. In the second millennium, he was invoked in funerary texts
and incantations, called upon for assistance as a ruler of the netherworld, much like the epic hero
Gilgamesh. These rituals indicate that Itana was not merely a character from a bygone era,
but a potent symbol and spiritual presence believed to possess the power to aid the living and the
dead. However, Itana's presence in later periods diminishes. He is not mentioned in letters or
inscriptions, and his legacy seems confined to lists and historical accounts. This suggests
that while Itana's story and his journey to heaven once held significant cultural and religious
weight, over time his relevance faded and he became a figure of the past, remembered more for his
mythic journey than his continued influence. The narrative of Itana is essentially a royal myth
with a critical message about the nature of sovereignty. The secret that Itana brings down
from heaven is not a simple object or piece of knowledge, but the very concept of kingship itself,
a divine mandate or blessing that legitimizes and empowers earthly rulers. This theme resonates
with broader Mesopotamian beliefs about the connection between the divine and the royal,
where kingship is often portrayed as a gift from the gods, and kings are seen as intermediaries
between the heavens and the earth. While the traditions surrounding supernatural sages like
Adapa or the Apkalu continue through a more extended history and are integrated into various
aspects of ritual and culture, the narratives of kings heavenly ascents like that of Itana
during the earth three period have a more concise historical arc. However, the impact of these
stories is profound, suggesting deep seated beliefs about the divine right of kings,
the origins of power, and the role of rulers in bridging the celestial and terrestrial realms.
Through Itana's story and others like it, Mesopotamian culture expressed its understanding
of the cosmos, authority, and the human quest for knowledge and power. The skyward journey
of royalty during ancient Mesopotamia's Ur the Thur and Isen Eres circa 21st century BCE.
Intriguingly, the first dimensions of a royal climb to the cosmos in ancient Mesopotamia are
not found in mythical tales or regal chronicles, but in the mundane ledgers of commerce, a financial
document from the earth for era notes allocations made when King Shulgi soared to the stars.
There a group of female slaves work of 142 13 female slave days on the day when Shulgi ascended
to heaven and was released was withdrawn against Anana. The dating notation indicating the 48th
year and 11th month of Shulgi's reign, intriguingly suggests these events occurred posthumously.
This depiction of Shulgi's afterlife elevation to a celestial abode marks a unique instance of a
monarch metamorphosing into a star. A subsequent illustration of kingly celestial ascent is
documented shortly thereafter in an economic account related to Ishbe era. This particular
record itemizes resources allocated for a grand morning ceremony commemorating the monarch's
ascension. This peculiar trend of noting heavenly ascents and date stamped financial documents
should be considered alongside the broader theme of divine status, granted to rulers during the
Ur-3 and Isen dynasties. Initially under Narum's sin in the Akkadian era and later beginning
with Shulgi, Sumerian sovereigns started to adopt divine epithets as evidenced by the holy symbol
prefix to their names and other godly ceremonial roles they undertook, including being the subject
of hymns. Starting with Shulgi, it might have been customary to view each king through the
Isen dynasty as having taken their place in the heavens post-mortem. Shulgi in particular
enjoys a distinctive status being acknowledged as a star constellation in additional texts.
Since these accounts don't merely relay myths but detail official state rituals, they offer a rare
and valuable glimpse into the tangible ways religious belief and political ideology were
interwoven during the Ur-3 and Isen epochs. This singular one-way journey to the afterlife,
noted in the economic records for Shulgi and Ishbe era, stands alone within the broader
collection ancient Mesopotamian texts and traditions. Dr. Steinkeller's 2013 study offers a credible
interpretation of the rituals surrounding these ascents, drawing parallels with the more thoroughly
recorded funeral rites of Ur-3's King Shusuin. In contrast, other known instances of humans
ascending to the heavens in Mesopotamian lore typically involve a temporary visitation aimed
at altering divine decrees or the fate of the visitor, as seen in the stories of Adapa and
Atana. These narratives often link celestial journeys with royalty but are distinct from the
irreversible divine ascent of Shulgi and Ishbe era. The tale of Atana, for example, is maintained in
a literary format, emphasizing its mythic nature, whereas the ascension of these divinized kings
is framed as a factual occurrence, with its costs and timing meticulously recorded, lending it a
unique form of historical and economic legitimacy. This portrayal, as a historical event, imbues the
ascension with a sense of official reality akin to that of any state ceremony, marking it as a
unique phenomenon in Mesopotamian records. Later historical texts from the region do
reincorporate the motif of ascension for political ends, often featuring a wise figure as the
protagonist, yet none carry the same public and state-sanctioned weight as the ascensions of Shulgi
and Ishbe era, the god Dumuzi ascending. The ascent narrative takes an intriguing turn with
Dumuzi, a figure who transcends mortal kingship to achieve divine status. In Mesopotamian lore,
Dumuzi is the exceptional royal entity who is depicted as ascending to the heavens,
a journey documented in two notable instances within the region's vast literary canon.
The first of these instances is encapsulated in a hymn dedicated to Inanna, a deity intimately
tied to Dumuzi's mythos, while the exact dating of this text remains uncertain. Its thematic and
stylistic elements suggest it originated sometime between the Ur-3 and old Babylonian periods,
indicating a continuity of the ascent motif over centuries. Dumuzi's unique narrative,
blending human origins with divine destiny, adds a complex layer to the Mesopotamian
understanding of the afterlife and the divine realm. In the face of Dumuzi's impending demise,
a poignant plea emerges within the narrative. Inanna, a goddess deeply connected to Dumuzi,
calls upon her own mother Ningal and Dumuzi's mother Zertur. The poetic structure of the text
alternates between these two maternal figures, reflecting a rhythmic appeal to place Dumuzi
among the stars, possibly as a constellation. This proposed celestial elevation of Dumuzi
mirrors the one-way ascension of Shulgi, yet it's crucial to recognize that Dumuzi's
ascent is not presented as an accomplished reality, but rather as a fervent wish amidst the
shadow of his mortality. The text stops short of confirming his ascent, leaving it as a hopeful
vision rather than a reported event. The second mention of Dumuzi's presence in the heavens
is found in the myth of Adapa, a narrative preserved in both old Babylonian Sumerian
and later Akkadian versions. This account seems to subtly acknowledge the potential success of
Inanna's plea. Adapa, upon his arrival in the celestial realm, is informed that he will encounter
Dumuzi there, indicating that Dumuzi is acknowledged in the afterlife. The story suggests a ritualistic
mourning for Dumuzi, akin to grieving for a deceased deity. In this heavenly setting,
Dumuzi assumes the role of a doorkeeper, a position reminiscent of Inanna's duties in the
netherworld. This portrayal reinforces the idea of Dumuzi's transformed state from a once mortal
king to a divine figure with specific responsibilities in the afterlife, reflecting the intricate
interplay between myth, ritual, and the conceptualization of divinity in ancient Mesopotamian
culture, the ascent of the sage Adapa. In the rich picture of Mesopotamian intellectual history,
the story of Adapa stands out as the most enduring and widespread narrative among ancient scribes.
Adapa, a legendary figure, is more than just a prominent character. He is the quintessential
symbol of wisdom and expertise in language and ritual for Mesopotamian scribes.
His story is not just a myth, it represents the zenith of scholarly achievement and is
central to understanding the cultural and intellectual milieu of the time. Adapa's
influence permeated the very core of Mesopotamian scholarly practice, particularly evident in
the long-standing incantation series known as udug.ho, Evil Demons. In these incantations,
scribes would assert their authority and challenge malevolent forces by invoking Adapa's name,
claiming, I am Adapa. This practice, which spanned approximately 2,000 years, underscores the deep
seated reverence and identification scribes had with Adapa's wisdom and power. From the old
Babylonian period onward, Adapa's popularity surged, making him arguably the most renowned sage
by the first millennium. His significance is further highlighted in key texts like the Babylonian
Temple Handbook Tintier, where he is mentioned right after the mighty god Marduk. The breadth
of Adapa's influence is seen in the diversity of genres and texts that feature him, ranging from
letters and royal monuments to incantations, handbooks, catalogs, and narratives. This widespread
representation across various forms of written culture is unparalleled, making Adapa a unique
and vital figure for understanding the broader context of Mesopotamian intellectual and cultural
practices. The complexity and pervasiveness of Adapa's role in Mesopotamian literature
make him a challenging subject to study comprehensively. Yet, this very complexity
is what renders him an essential figure for scholars seeking to grasp the nuances of Mesopotamian
scribal culture. Unlike other mythic or historical figures who might appear in a limited set of
texts, Adapa's story evolves and adapts over time, reflecting the changing needs, audiences,
and objectives of the scribes who revered him. His presence across a wide array of literary forms
indicates not just his importance, but also the dynamic and evolving nature of Mesopotamian
scholarship and culture. In the field of Assyriology, researchers have traditionally devoted much
attention to the detailed examination of the Adapa myth, often focusing on the text itself rather
than considering the broader context of how it was interpreted and understood by ancient Mesopotamian
scholars. This approach has resulted in a diverse array of modern interpretations, which is fitting
given the inherent richness and ambiguity of the Adapa story. The myth is recognized as a
multifaceted literary piece that not only allows, but also seems to invite, multiple interpretations.
The text of the Adapa myth and the traditions surrounding it show evidence of evolution
and reinterpretation over time. This indicates that the story was not static, but was continually
adapted and re-understood by those who read and used it. It's not that the myth lacks a specific
meaning, rather it's that its meaning and the role of Adapa himself varied over time and context.
Adapa's enduring relevance and significance in Mesopotamian scholarly tradition suggests that
he represented more than a single idea or concept to the scholars of the time. His significance
was multifaceted and dynamic, reflecting the changing needs, interpretations, and intellectual
currents of Mesopotamian society. This study aims to delve into the interpretive and practical
aspects of Adapa's role, focusing on what he symbolized to ancient Mesopotamian sages. It builds
on the foundational work of Dr. Picchioni's 1981 Italian edition, which compiled many of the
non-narrative mentions of Adapa. While Picchioni's work laid the textual groundwork for understanding
historical uses of Adapa in Mesopotamia, it hasn't been thoroughly analyzed, especially not in
English. This research seeks to fill that gap by examining Adapa within the cultural context of
ancient Mesopotamia, rather than relying on speculative reconstructions. This approach aims
to provide solid evidence of how Adapa's roles evolved, and how these changes aligned with
broader shifts in Mesopotamian history and ideology. From the earliest sources, Adapa is
portrayed as a master of language and ritual, whose potent speech can threaten demons and gods
alike. To understand Adapa's origins and enduring influence, the study will first explore his roots
in the Old Babylonian Period, focusing on two texts, the Sumerian Precursors to the Succul,
Udug.Hul, Incantations, and the Myth of Adapa and the South Wind. These works help establish his role
and significance for nearly two millennia. Given the vast and varied later sources about Adapa,
this research will organize the materials by genre. This categorization will enable a clearer
analysis of how Adapa's portrayal and significance shifted over time and how these changes corresponded
with the evolving genres of Mesopotamian literature, such as monumental inscriptions
and historical records. This genre-based approach will also reflect how Adapa's image and use were
influenced by the changing political landscapes and fortunes of the first millennium empires.
Through this comprehensive examination, the study aims to provide a nuanced understanding
of Adapa's multifaceted role in Mesopotamian intellectual and cultural history.
The earliest rituals and myths about Adapa, Old Babylonian Period, see 1800-1600 BCE.
The most ancient ritual mention of Adapa is found within an Old Babylonian Sumerian incantation
originating from Nipur. Although the original text is damaged and fragmented,
scholars are able to reconstruct its content with a high degree of confidence thanks to
closely related texts from later periods that provide parallel. These later parallels offer
insights into the text's original form and content, allowing modern researchers to piece together
and understand the significance of Adapa in this early ritual context.
By the time of the Old Babylonian Period, Adapa had already begun to assume a central role in
the activities of Mesopotamian scribes, particularly in the realm of exorcism and ritual. This
significance is underscored by his mention in the Udug Hul, Evil Demons, texts which are among the
oldest and most enduring Mesopotamian ritual series. The mention of Adapa in these texts
is not only historically significant for being the earliest known ritual reference to him,
but also because it connects to the very last known instances of such texts stretching all
the way to the first century AD. This enduring relevance highlights Adapa's deep-rooted importance
in Mesopotamian scholarly and ritual practices. The inclusion of Adapa in Udug Hul is part of a
broader trend of curating and compiling rituals into comprehensive collections, a practice that
began in the Old Babylonian Period and continued for centuries. These collections were not merely
academic, they were practical tools for scribes and exorcists used in combating the demonic
forces believed to cause disease and misfortune. The rituals within these texts, including those
involving Adapa, were part of a living tradition, continually edited and updated to meet the needs
of the time. The narrative of Adapa and the mythological elements within the Udug Hul text
share key features, especially in their earliest forms. In both the incantation and the myth,
Adapa is depicted as a powerful ritualist hailing from Eridu, the city of Enki,
the god of magic and secret knowledge. This association with Enki and Eridu enhances Adapa's
stature as a figure capable of confronting and controlling supernatural forces, notably in the
ritual texts. The practitioner performing the incantation claims to be Adapa, embodying his
role and power. This practice of self-predication, where the exorcist identifies with a supernatural
entity like Adapa or an Apkalu, a sage or demigod, is a common feature in early versions of these
texts. It illustrates the deep personal and professional connection Mesopotamian scholars
felt with Adapa, viewing him not just as a mythic figure, but as a potent and accessible persona to
embody and channel in their ritual practices. The myth of Adapa and the South Wind, this ancient
narrative, one of the most detailed and compelling from the realms of Mesopotamian lore, has been
intertwined with mystical rituals since its inception. The earliest rendition, a Sumerian masterpiece
from the old Babylonian era discovered at Tel Hadad, is more than a mere tale.
It culminates with a powerful incantation, where the deity Enki addresses the South Wind,
transforming the story into a historiola, a myth with a purpose aimed at combating the demons of
disease. From the moment we delve into its lines, it's clear that this isn't just literary artistry,
it's a magical medical narrative akin to the ancient spells of Uduk Hul. Interestingly, this
Sumerian version also includes a lengthy prologue, setting the story in a time before time, a feature
missing in its later retellings. The Middle Babylonian version, found in far-off Egypt's Amarna,
is more concise, omitting both the mystical prologue and the incantation. Yet, as the tale evolves
through the ages, reaching the Neo-Assyrian epic in Nineveh, the tradition of concluding with an
incantation resurfaces, this time invoking the goddess Gula to ward off illness. At its heart,
Adapa's tale remains consistent across variations, blending myth with ritual. However, in the mythic
narrative, Adapa's mastery of words and wisdom doesn't solve mortal quandaries, instead, it presents
a celestial conundrum, challenging the gods themselves. The Sumerian version begins in the
primordial age shrouded in mystery. In those distant days, after the flood had swept over and
the destruction of the land had been brought about, the tale unfolds in a primordial epic,
a time of emerging consciousness and the dawn of civilization. It speaks of monumental inventions
that shaped human history, the creation of canals, the birth of agriculture, and the establishment
of kingship, specifically referencing the legendary First Dynasty of Kish, possibly led by the
mythical Etana. This era, while marked by a nascent burgeoning knowledge, was also a period of blissful
naivete. The mighty south wind, known only for its benign influences, blew across a world where
the concepts of command and obedience were yet to be understood. After a gap in the narrative,
we meet Adapa, a fervent follower. Adapa's daily routine involves fishing to provide for Enki's
temple in the ancient city of Eridu. His seafaring is a precarious art, managing without the aid of
a rudder or pole, yet his skill is unmatched. However, one day, his boat is capsized by the
tumultuous south wind. In a fit of rage, Adapa breaks the wings of the wind, causing a disturbance
that reaches the high heavens and the ears of the supreme deity, Anu. Anu's decree is for Adapa
to ascend to heaven. Before his journey, Enki counsels Adapa with cryptic advice about the
offerings he will encounter in heaven, bread, water, a garment, and oil. Enki instructs him to
refuse the first three, but to accept the oil. Additionally, Adapa is to dawn morning attire,
and upon meeting the deities, Dumuzi and Niggish Zita, he is to explain that their demise is the
reason for his earthly presence. This act of respect is meant to grant him favor and entry into
the divine realm. Adapa's arrival in heaven coincides with a moment of ritual significance.
On the day of ritual bathing, the day of the new moon, the day of judgment.
In heaven, Adapa is received with honors befitting a deity, even offered a throne,
a symbol of his potential elevation to immortality. Yet, as forewarned by Enki, he declines the gifts
of bread, water, and a garment, each a metaphorical key to eternal life. And the high god upon
witnessing Adapa's refusal reveals a bitter truth with a laugh. Enki, in his cunning wisdom,
has orchestrated this very scenario to prevent Adapa from attaining immortality. The narrative
reaches its climax with two pivotal events. First, Adapa is charged with the task of mending
the south wind's wings, a symbolic act of reconciliation and restoration of order.
Following this, and decrees a momentous shift in the cosmos, the instructions,
agar, rituals, bedluda, and principles of order, me, are to descend from the heavens,
granting humanity access to divine knowledge for the first time. This celestial download
marks a new era where humans can harness and ritualize the powers that once solely belong
to the gods. The story concludes with an incantation, possibly the first of its kind,
a magical utterance against the south wind. This spell, derived from Enki's own power,
symbolizes the newfound ability of humans to interact with and influence the divine realm.
In this moment, Adapa's tale transforms from a narrative of personal trial to a foundational myth
explaining the origins of human wisdom, rituals, and the very fabric of ordered society.
Through Adapa's journey, the story illustrates the transition from a world governed by the
whims of gods to one where humans hold the knowledge to shape their own destinies.
The ancient text of Adapa and the south wind presents three distinct elements that diverge
from its later adaptations, spanning from the late Bronze Age Akkadian versions to Hellenistic
Greek interpretations by Barassos. These variations not only highlight the evolving narrative of
Adapa, but also align with the broader tradition surrounding this mythic figure.
Etiology of Adapa's power. The original tale serves as a detailed etiology,
explaining the origins of Adapa's unique, yet transmissible abilities over demons and healing.
The story vividly illustrates a paradox where Adapa initially disables a demonic wind and is
subsequently divinely chosen to heal it. This act symbolizes his dominance over formidable
supernatural forces. Later versions transform this theme, often diluting the explicit nature of
Adapa's dual role as both conqueror and healer of the demonic, Adapa's heavenly throne.
In the earliest accounts, Adapa is granted a throne in heaven, signifying a potential
elevation to divinity or immortality. This significant event fades from later narratives,
though echoes of it resurface in the first millennium Babylonian shrines,
where the son of U'an, Adapa, is mentioned as sitting on the throne of U'an. The disappearance
and subtle reemergence of this motif in later texts indicate a shifting perspective on Adapa's
status and his relationship with the divine, cultural heroism, and order. Initially, Adapa
is portrayed as a pivotal figure in introducing culture and order to humanity. His heavenly
initiation triggers the descent of cosmic principles, guiding human civilization's
development. This aspect is creatively reinterpreted by Borosos, who recasts Adapa as a Hellenistic
culture hero, a proto's heretics or first inventor. This reimagining reflects a broader
trend in ancient narratives to align older myths with contemporary cultural and intellectual ideals.
These divergences highlight the fluid nature of myth-making, where stories adapt to fit new
contexts and audiences, altering characters and events to resonate with the prevailing cultural
ethos. Adapa's tale, with its variations, serves as a fascinating example of how myths
evolve, reflecting the changing values, beliefs, and knowledge of the societies that retell them.
The scholarship surrounding the Akkadian narratives of Adapa delves into the inherent paradoxes
presented in the texts. The question of whether Adapa's visit to heaven was a triumph or a failure,
and whether he ultimately benefited or harmed humanity. These narratives offer ambiguous
elements that Assyriologists have interpreted in various, often contrasting, ways.
One significant piece of evidence comes from a proverb from the early second millennium,
which portrays Adapa as a figure who knows no loss as he traverses the mountains. A term
also denoting the cosmic underworld or otherworld. This depiction aligns Adapa with the archetype
of a wise and capable explorer of both the physical and metaphysical realms. The incident
where Adapa encounters a supernatural disaster on the waters near Eridu. Asogirid with the Abzu,
the cosmic home of Enki. Further cements his role in navigating and interacting with
this orderworldly spaces. This duality of being weeps and entangled in cosmic conflicts is central
to the nature and power of the Apkalu, of which Adapa is a prime example. Adapa's most enduring
qualities, as highlighted in Israel's study, language has power of life and death, are his
absolute power over words and his role as the servant of Enki, the god of wisdom, magic, and
mischief. These attributes mark him as a patron figure for scribes and ritual practitioners.
However, despite these insights, the literary analysis of Adapa's story remains inherently
inconclusive due to its fundamentally ambiguous nature, a characteristic that is quintessential
to understanding Adapa himself. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of Adapa's significance,
scholars propose examining how Mesopotamians scribes and their culture historically interpreted
and utilized the figure of Adapa. By exploring these native interpretations and the various
contexts in which Mesopotamian scholars applied the myth of Adapa, one can uncover how his meaning
and relevance evolved over time within the culture. This approach goes beyond literary analysis,
seeking to understand the broader cultural and historical implications of Adapa's story and
how it influenced and reflected the beliefs, values, and knowledge of the Mesopotamian civilization.
First Millennium Kings and Adapa
First Millennium Mesopotamian Kings often sought to align themselves with figures of mythic wisdom
and power to legitimize and exalt their rule, and Adapa emerged as a particularly
resonant symbol for these rulers. Sargon II, notable for his conquest of Israel,
is the earliest known ruler to invoke Adapa, choosing him over other mythic heroes like Gilgamesh
or Atrahasis. In an inscription from his town Dur Sharroukin, Fort Sargon, he is likened to Adapa
in terms of open-mindedness, perceptiveness, and wisdom, attributes essential for a ruler of his
stature and ambition. This comparison wasn't merely a personal boast, but a political and
intellectual strategy. By aligning himself with Adapa, a sage known for his wisdom and power over
the supernatural, Sargon the Sen and subsequent kings, like Sennacherib and Eserhaddin, were not
just claiming a metaphorical kinship with these revered figures, but were also asserting their
divine mandate and exceptional intellectual and moral qualities. The term rival, equal,
shenot used in these references suggests that these kings saw themselves not just as ordinary
rulers, but as possessing a wisdom and capability on par with the legendary sages, a significant
claim in a culture that highly valued such knowledge and power. This association also had
practical implications. It wasn't just about personal or divine wisdom, but was tied to the
very real and tangible achievements of these rulers, particularly in their building programs
and military conquests. For instance, Sennacherib's annals don't just praise his wisdom, they link
it directly to the success of his construction projects and conquests, suggesting that his
capabilities are evidence of his divine endowment and his rightful place as a ruler.
Similarly, Eserhaddin's claim of being, rival of the sage Adapa, while discussing his plans for
rebuilding an arsenal further solidifies this trend. These kings weren't just comparing themselves
to Adapa, they were positioning themselves within a tradition of divinely sanctioned wisdom and power,
asserting their rule as a continuation of the cosmic order and cultural heritage that Adapa
represented. This strategic invocation of Adapa reflects a sophisticated understanding of the
power of myth and symbolism in upholding and justifying the authority of kings in ancient
Mesopotamian society. The evolving narrative of Assyrian kings aligning themselves with Adapa
reflects a broader shift in the royal ideology of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, particularly under
the Sargonid dynasty. The Sargonids didn't just perform more rituals and collect more texts,
they also expanded the range of textual genres incorporated into their royal inscriptions.
This practice wasn't merely about showcasing the diversity of their empire's knowledge,
but was a deliberate move to position the royal texts themselves as symbols of Assyrian knowledge
and power. The kings' deeds were increasingly presented not just as military or administrative
achievements, but as scholarly and cognitive feats. This shift is evident in the way kings like
Assurbanipal, who reigned from 669-630 BCE, spoke of their accomplishments.
Assurbanipal's building inscription is particularly telling. While it does describe his building program,
the focus is on his comprehensive, scholarly knowledge. His claim of grasping the work of the
sage Adapa, the hidden treasure of the whole scribal art, suggests a deeper connection with
Adapa's wisdom, possibly even attributing the invention of cuneiform writing to him.
This statement isn't just about venerating an ancient sage, it's about claiming a direct lineage
and mastery over the same profound and hidden knowledge that Adapa was said to possess.
For Assurbanipal, this scholarly prowess wasn't just a personal trait, but a central aspect of
his rule. He didn't just claim to be in the temples or part of the council of scholars,
he also professed the ability to interpret dreams and tablets, skills that would have
been highly valued in Assyrian society for their connection to divine wisdom and guidance.
This isn't just the king presenting himself as a warrior or a builder, but as a scholar,
a wise man, and a priestly figure with access to cosmic secrets and divine favor.
These narratives reflect a sophisticated understanding of kingship, where power isn't
just derived from military might or divine right, but also from wisdom, learning, and a
connection to the cultural and intellectual heritage of the empire. By aligning themselves with
Adapa and emphasizing their scholarly achievements, these kings were not just constructing a persona
for themselves, they were crafting an image of the Assyrian empire as a realm of knowledge,
wisdom, and cosmic order, with the king as both its guardian and its greatest exemplar.
Assurbanipal's reign marked a significant transformation in Assyrian scribal culture,
characterized by the state-sponsored expansion and modification of intellectual traditions.
This period saw a surge in the production of commentaries and ritual texts, indicating a
broader intellectual movement rather than mere preservation of existing knowledge.
The emergence of entirely new discursive forms, notably the cultic commentary, exemplifies this
shift. These texts were not just additions to the scholarly corpus, but were notably complex
and challenging, suggesting they were intended for a select informed audience.
The complexity of these materials likely stems from their in-group nature, designed for a
scholarly community deeply immersed in the nuances of their craft. The process described
as in textualization, where oral traditions and discourses are transformed into fixed written texts,
played a significant role here. Linguistic anthropologists observe that this shift from
fluid oral tradition to fixed written form often involves a level of abstraction and
formalization that can make the resulting texts obscure to those not initiated into their specific
context and use. This move towards creating complex, explanatory texts that are difficult for
the uninitiated to understand wasn't just an academic exercise. It represented an extension
of neo-Assyrian centralizing power into the realm of writing and intellectual life,
by fostering a state-sponsored scholarly culture in creating texts that required specialized
knowledge to understand. The Assyrian state was not just preserving knowledge, but actively
shaping it. This effort was likely aimed at furthering the centralization and standardization
of knowledge, aligning intellectual culture with the state's political and cultural objectives.
The appearance of these difficult context-dependent texts in royal libraries is more than a mere
historical curiosity. It's indicative of a broader strategy to control and direct the
intellectual life of the empire. These texts served as a record of the state's engagement
with an authority over scholarly activity, demonstrating a deliberate policy of cultivating
controlling and utilizing intellectual culture to reinforce the power and prestige of the Assyrian
state and its ruler. This period represents a pivotal moment in the history of Assyrian
intellectual culture, where the state actively intervened to shape, standardize, and control
the production and dissemination of knowledge. Asurbanapal's claim to have grasped all knowledge
is akin to a scholarly superhero's boast, presenting himself as an ancient sage with
extraordinary powers. This image is not just for show, but serves as political theater,
positioning him as a rival to celestial beings, privy to the universe's secrets,
and a decoder of mystical messages among the intellectual elite. He's like a character
from a cosmic drama, claiming a lineage from wise ancestors and divine beings,
much like a royal, claiming descent from gods. In contrast, Nebuchadnezzar the Fur,
another ruler, paints himself with a humbler brush, tracing his roots back to a Sumerian king
famed for divination, but doesn't claim such powers himself. Instead, he projects this mystical
ability back into a storied past, creating a grandiose family tree. Asurbanapal's scholars
run with this theme, suggesting he descends from a sage and the mythical Adapa, further
blending politics with the prestige of the scholarly world. As empires fell and rose in
Mesopotamia, the character Adapa morphed from a wise man into a symbol of the changing relationship
between knowledge and power. Babylonian scholarship, with its rich intellectual tradition, continued
and even blossomed in some areas like mathematical astronomy. Yet, its tie to the ruling regime
evolved significantly. By the time the Persians ruled, the dynamics had flipped entirely. Kings
like Cyrus used the scholarly narrative to undermine their predecessors, employing the
same sophisticated language to craft satirical tales. One such parody ridicules Nabonitis,
circa 540-530 BCE, previous ruler, by depicting him as a bumbling artist who made a hideous statue
of the moon god, turning the profound relationship between wisdom and royal authority into a
farcical anecdote. The criticism aimed at Nabonitis suggests that his religious reforms were so
outlandish they shocked even the gods and sages, those believed to have conceived the cosmos.
Central to this is Aya, a deity envisioned as crafting every creature and concept within the
Apsu, a primordial, watery abyss representing the source of all wisdom and forms.
Adapa, a mythic figure, is renowned as the one who knows the names of all Ea's creation,
reflecting the ancient belief that knowing something's name grants power over it.
This portrayal of Adapa as the ultimate scholar and exorcist is critical. In Mesopotamian education,
much learning revolved around understanding signs and names, with the idea that naming an
ailment is a step toward curing it. Adapa's role is somewhat akin to Adam in Genesis,
who names animals, or God in Psalm 147, who names the stars. Yet it's perhaps most closely
mirrored by Enoch in the Aramaic texts, who, in a divine revelation, learns the names of all the
star. As the narrative continues, Cyrus inserts a tirade into Nabonitis' mouth, using this ancient
tradition of naming and knowledge as a backdrop to criticize and mock his predecessors' religious
practices, highlighting the intertwining of knowledge, power, and religion in the ancient world.
Nabonitis is depicted as declaring he surpasses Adapa in knowledge, referencing a piece titled
The Lunar Crescent of Anu and Enlil. This statement is laced with a Sumerian pun that
is lost in translation, but intended to portray Nabonitis as both mad and conceited. The irony
is thick. He's trying to align himself with the esteemed astronomical divinatory text,
Anuma Anu Enlil, yet he bungles it. His obsession with the moon god leads him to misrepresent the
text's name, inadvertently substituting it with a deity's name. This portrayal is biting criticism,
implying that Nabonitis' religious fervor has made him foolish, so much so that he confuses a
foundational scholarly work with his personal deity. It's a clever play on words that paints him as
profoundly out of, touch, unable to grasp even the basics that every learned person would know,
and suggests his innovations in religion stem from ignorance and delusion rather than enlightenment.
This scathing parody marks a seismic shift in Mesopotamian history and culture, becoming possible
only after the demise of local rulers. The satire turns the Neo-Assyrian tradition on its head.
Previously, kings like Assurbanipal would compare themselves to Adapa to elevate their status,
but now Nabonitis' self-comparison is mocked, his ambition seen as overreaching hubris.
This inversion of roles highlights the changed landscape where the once revered association
of a king with an apkalu, a wise sage, is now seen as almost sacrilegious. This new portrayal
of Adapa signifies a broader historical transformation. Mesopotamian scholarship,
once a tool in the hands of the king to legitimize his rule, has slipped from the monarchy's grasp.
Cyrus' verse account reflects this shift, part of a wider evolution in Mesopotamian literary
genres. While the Akkadian tradition of royal inscriptions continues, the context dramatically
changes with foreign rulers now at the helm, altering the dynamic between royal authority and
indigenous traditions. While Persian kings did adopt certain Mesopotamian cultural and rhetorical
elements, they selectively chose what suited them. A Persian king never again claims the
de-traditional Mesopotamian knowledge, or portrays himself as a sage of cuneiform wisdom. The era
of kings boasting divine wisdom and sage-like prowess ended not with a whisper, but with a
scornful jest at the expense of a native king, marking a definitive end to a long-standing
tradition. When Mesopotamian scholarship continued without a native king, it underwent a significant
transformation. The scholars and scribes who had long been pivotal in maintaining and administering
Mesopotamian cultural and religious traditions found themselves in a new role. Without a Mesopotamian
monarch to serve, these learned groups maintained their prominence, but their relationship with
power and tradition evolved. They began to take more direct control of the public manifestations
of their knowledge, collaborating with the new foreign rulers. Textual traditions once a means
to link the present with the divine and the ancestral past continued to serve this purpose,
but the scribes were now the primary custodians of this continuity.
They became the sole bearers of an ancient legacy, preserving and perpetuating the wisdom of the past
in a world where the political landscape had dramatically shifted.
This transition is evident in the cuneiform texts from the Persian and Hellenistic periods.
These texts, produced under new rulers and different cultural influences, reflect the
changing role of scholars and the enduring importance of their work. A poignant example
of this continuity amidst change is the Brick of Anuubalit Kefalon, a figure with a hybrid
Babylonian Greek name indicative of the cultural transformations during the Seleucid period,
as a city magistrate in Uruk under Antiochus IV, his Brick in the new Seleucid Era Shrine,
the Res Shrine which Oana Zadapa built of old, as shows the enduring legacy of Mesopotamian tradition,
even as the political and cultural context transformed, the scholars continued to assert
their ancient heritage, linking the present with the mythical past and showcasing the resilience
and adaptability of Mesopotamian scholarship. The dedication on the massive new Anu Temple in
Uruk represents a remarkable shift in Mesopotamian tradition. Historically, building inscriptions
were the domain of kings and governors, symbols of their power, piety and connection to a venerable
past. They often boasted of reconstructing ancient works, linking themselves to revered royal ancestors.
However, this unique inscription attributes the construction of a temple to a mythical sage,
Adapa, rather than a reigning monarch. This unprecedented move highlights the evolving
memory and status of kings and sages during the Seleucid period. The concept of a sage as a builder
had mythical precedents. Gilgamesh, for example, likened the impeccable foundations of Uruk to the
work of the seven counselors. Yet, the explicit credit given to Adapa for building the Resh Temple,
the grandest shrine to the sky god Anu, is unparalleled. This shift is significant,
indicating that the traditional royal prerogative of founding temples had been symbolically transferred
to a figure of wisdom and knowledge. Adapa's prominence in the Resh Temple's rituals during
the Hellenistic period further underscores this transformation. He wasn't just a mythical figure
from the past, he was actively incorporated into contemporary religious practices,
participating in the procession of gods during significant ceremonies. His role extended beyond
the Resh Temple. He was also significant in the Asagula Temple at Babylon, dedicated to the same
sky god Anu. The inclusion of Adapa in these contexts, especially in the Uruk Temple's archives
as the sage associated with the first king in history, marks a historical departure. A mythical
sage now usurped what was traditionally a royal privilege, reflecting a broader shift in how
knowledge, power, and tradition were conceptualized. In a time of changing rulers and cultures,
the elevation of a sage over a king in such a public and permanent manner speaks to the enduring
influence and reimagined role of Mesopotamian scholarship in maintaining and reshaping the
region's cultural and religious identity. The Seleucid period in Uruk presents a fascinating
tapestry of cultural intermingling, where Hellenistic, Babylonian, and Aramaic influences
converged. This blend is vividly embodied by the author of the Anu Temple inscription, who also
crafted Aramaic glazed brick inscriptions for the irrigale, another principal temple in Uruk.
This individual's work represents a microcosm of the broader cultural synthesis of the era.
In this time, rulers and prominent figures, though perhaps of Greek origin or influence,
deeply embedded themselves within the Mesopotamian societal and economic fabric.
They adopted Mesopotamian customs and contributed to the local architecture and religious life.
Their Greek Akkadian names, a hybrid identity marker, were inscribed on the very temples that
stood as symbols of Mesopotamian spiritual and cultural heritage. However, these inscriptions
were an Aramaic script, reflecting the linguistic and cultural diversity of the period. The use of
glazed bricks for these inscriptions harks back to a long Mesopotamian tradition known for its
vibrant and durable architectural decorations. By inscribing their names in this enduring medium,
these rulers and officials were not just asserting their presence, but were also weaving themselves
into the long-standing historical and cultural narrative of the region. This period was marked
by a dynamic exchange and fusion of ideas, practices, and identities.
The temples of Uruk, with their multilingual and multicultural inscriptions, stand as testament
to a time when ancient Mesopotamian traditions were reinterpreted and reinvigorated through
the lens of Hellenistic and Aramaic influences, creating a unique and enduring cultural legacy.
Adapa in Catalogues and Letters
Adapa's elevation in Mesopotamian lore as a scribal hero and author significantly impacted
perceptions of authorship and knowledge transmission. He has featured in several catalogues,
hinting at his revered status and perhaps even crediting him as the author of significant
astronomical divinatory texts. This reverence is not just a nod to his mythical wisdom,
but also to his role as a transmitter and creator of knowledge. The depiction of Adapa as both a
scribe and an author reflects the deep respect for the written word and its creators in Mesopotamian
culture. His popularity in the first millennium Mesopotamian scribal tradition further underscores
this. Adapa wasn't just a mythical figure, he was a symbol, an emblematic character representing
the pinnacle of scholarly achievement. The texts attributed to him, whether genuinely his or ascribed
to him to lend authority, show the high regard in which scribes and scholars were held. The references
to Adapa in various texts and contexts indicate a complex layering of tradition, reverence,
and scholarly practice. He is at once a mythical figure, a sage, an author, and a symbol of the
profound connection between the divine, the cosmos, and the written word. This multifaceted
portrayal enriches our understanding of Mesopotamian culture and its deep-seated veneration for knowledge
and those who wielded it. At last, we've unearthed a mere sliver of an ancient library catalog from
the Seleucid era, name-dropping Adapa as a notable author. Intriguingly, this find was made in the
very temple Adapa was rumored to have built in Uruk, known as the Resh. In this locale, Adapa was
celebrated during the New Year's festivities in honor of Ishtar. Neo-Assyrian royal correspondences
echo this sentiment, portraying Adapa as the embodiment of kingly wisdom. For instance,
one scholarly letter exclaims, the king's deeds mirror those of Adapa. However, the most telling
piece of correspondence to Asurbanipal unveils a fascinating aspect of this intellectual monarch's
self-perception. He viewed himself not merely as a ruler, but as a paragon of Mesopotamian learning,
akin to the legendary Apkalu. Adapa's influence seemingly infiltrated the personal and professional
lives of a Syrian ruler. The kingdom's chief exorcist assured Esurhaddin, the king's mother
rivals Adapa in capability. That meanwhile, astrologers and other courtiers flattered the king
by comparing his wisdom to that of Adapa. In a particularly imaginative twist, a letter from
Marduk, Shumu Usur to Asurbanipal dreams of a celestial endorsement, proclaiming the king
as a descendant of both a sage and Adapa himself surpassing. The wisdom of the abyss and all
scholarship. This isn't just flattery, it's a testament to a broader royal narrative. Here,
the king is not just a political figure, but a scholarly giant, standing on the shoulders
of his revered ancestor, Sennacherib, and aspiring to the intellectual heights of Adapa. As history
would have it, the fate of Babylon and its ancient wisdom soon rested in the hands of such scholarly
kings. Adapa wasn't just a figure of royal admiration. He was a core symbol for ancient
sages, outliving even the great Asurbanipal by nearly a thousand years. His legacy was deeply
woven into the very identity of these learned men. The Utukku Lemnutu series, a set of Sumerian
Akkadian exorcistic incantations, serves as a testament to this enduring reverend. Originating
from the old Babylonian Uduk Hul texts, these incantations prominently featured Adapa and
remained in use up until the first century BCE. This collection wasn't just a set of rituals,
it was a symbolic embodiment of Adapa's wisdom and role. By invoking his name, the Ashipu,
or human ritual experts, weren't just performing rites. They were stepping into his shoes,
channeling his profound knowledge and mastery over the supernatural. In this way, Adapa's legacy
was more than just a story or a name. It was an enduring, living tradition that continued to inspire
and guide these ancient practitioners of the mystical arts.
Adapa was more than a mythical figure. He was a vital ally for ancient exorcists.
They called upon him for protection, particularly against Lemnutu, a demon known for abducting
children. In their rituals, these healers would command Lemnutu to the distant sea,
a place where her malevolent power would diminish, thereby safeguarding the community.
This practice underscored Adapa's enduring influence and the practical application of his
wisdom in combating darkness and disease. I will make you ride the forewind. I will
fill your boat with travel provisions, will send you just you off, the clever one, alternate text,
the one who cast spells on you. Adapa, sage of Eridu, is the one who looks at you. In Eridu,
he will scrutinize you, just you. He will neutralize your venom. He will keep your hands off from the
body of this infant under the protection of his god. Be off, go away. Adapa, with his sharp eye,
an undeniable charm, stands firm against the demoness, drawing strength from a mystical
underground spring, bubbling with magic and ancient secrets. Her tricks have met their match,
yet Lamaastu, her powers so vast, can only be advised by Adapa to seek her fortunes elsewhere.
Such is the scale of adversaries he faces. In his role as a maestro of words, both a ceremonial
wizard and a scribe, Adapa weaves his prowess into two spells disguised as letters. The first,
a cleverly crafted message, is addressed to a mysterious character whose very name
whispers of ancient times. A second letter, supposedly written by Adapa,
is directed to the legendary first king of Mesopotamia, Alulu, and it offers magical medical
advice. Not only reinforces Adapa's wisdom, but intriguingly positions him at the dawn
of Mesopotamian mythological history. Alulu isn't just any king. He's the inaugural ruler of Mesopotamia
and monarch of Eridu, Adapa's mythological stomping ground, and the domain of Enki, the
god connected to Adapa. The most detailed account of Adapa, including a sort of biography of him
and his sage companions, is found in the ritual called Boa Mesiri or the Sealed House. This ritual,
central to discussions about Adapa's mythological journey to the heavens, hasn't been fully translated
into English. Yet Dr. Seth L. Sanders translated the first incantation of Tablet 3 from this
significant Sumerian-Ecadian ritual text, offering a glimpse into this ancient narrative.
Puradu fish of the sea, seven Apkalu, formed in the river who keep the plans of heaven and earth
in order. Nungal Pirigal, Apkalu of Enmerkar, who brought Ishtar down from heaven into the Eanna.
Pirigal Nungal, formed in Kish, who angered Adad in heaven so that he did not let there
be rain or vegetation in the land for three years. Pirigal Abzu, formed in Adab, who hung his seal
on a sealfish and thus angered Enki in the Abzu so that a fool struck him with his own seal.
Fourth, Lunana, two-thirds Apkalu, who drove a dragon out of the Eninkyag. Nuna, the Ishtar
Temple of Shulgi, four Apkalu of human descent, who Lord Enki endowed with broad understanding,
ritual action. Before the seven Puradu Apkalu, who are striped with plaster and black paste,
which are drawn on the wall of the side of the sanctuary, you recite the above.
This ancient text is fascinating because it seems crafted to invoke a team of supernatural sages,
detailing their characteristics and recounting their tales. Known from the Neo-Assyrian era
and still in use during the Seleucid period, this text differs from other, more direct
incantations with its narrative style. Rather than issuing commands, it aims to make the sages,
known as Apkalu, present by recounting their histories and attributes. This isn't about
performing a magical medical act on the spot. It's about setting the stage for one, preparing
the ground by reciting these histories before images of the Apkalu to tap into their power for
the ritual's next steps. This incantation is particularly insightful as it's the sole text
merging stories of various sages, offering a peek into scholarly traditions of the first millennium.
However, it's not a straightforward guide. It attaches astonishing tales to name somewhat haphazardly,
with the real thread being the sages' disruptive force. The text mentions seven fish-like Apkalu
and four humanoid ones, the latter with more developed stories. Yet, in the broader ritual
context, only the fish Apkalu are visually represented, highlighting a selective use of
sage traditions. These narratives of conflict with gods and world-altering events mirror those
of Adapa, another sage with tumultuous tales. The real magic, it seems, lies not in the physical
representations, but in the mere act of recounting these sages' stories, invoking the raw,
disruptive power of their words and deeds. The roles and tales of the sages in Mesopotamian texts
are notably fluid, with variations and overlaps within and across narratives. The text opens
with a nod to Uwana, who is also known as U An Adapa, positioning Adapa as a premier sage
among the Apkalu. However, it attributes the heavenly ascent not to Adapa, but to the seventh
sage, Utu Abzu. This divergence is just one example of the fluidity, while Adapa is linked
with Enmercar. In one myth, another sage, Nungal Pirigal, is given that association here. Remarkably,
who completes the plan of heaven and earth. Attributed to Adapa is also applied collectively
to all seven non-human sages in subsequent lines. Additionally, while typically only Adapa is said
to have ascended to heaven among the Apkalu, Utu Abzu is also described as making this celestial
journey and even as descending from heaven in another fragmentary part of the text,
suggesting a possible division of Adapa's mythic journey. Understanding this attribute,
multiplication, and narrative fluidity is challenging. Scholars have often sought a single,
canonical Mesopotamian ascent narrative, usually focusing on a heroic figure, the seventh in a
sequence, linked with names like Adapa, Utu Abzu, and Enmercar. However, this approach likely
oversimplifies the rich, varied, and evolving tapestry of Mesopotamian scribal culture.
The multiple strands and historical shifts within this tradition suggest that looking
for a single, unchanging story might be a misunderstanding of how these myths functioned
and developed over time. Instead, the overlapping roles and shared attributes among different sages
reflect a dynamic storytelling tradition, where themes and characteristics are fluid, shared,
and repurposed across different figures and tales. The notion of placing a hero in the seventh
position is a common narrative and structuring motif, seen in both Mesopotamian and Judahite
genealogies. This pattern is not just a storytelling technique, but also serves as an
organizational principle, reflecting a broader, cultural, and mythological significance to the
number seven. Dr. Borger's 1974 analysis highlights Utu Abzu's association with the seventh king,
Enmedoranke, in a Seleucid-era Uruk list of kings and sages, proposing Utu Abzu as the archetypal
sage who ascended to heaven, suggesting a parallel with the biblical Enoch. However,
this connection, based on a single document, doesn't necessarily reflect a widespread tradition.
Mesopotamian texts frequently recombine and rearrange figures and attributes, demonstrating
the fluidity and adaptability of these narratives. For instance, while Adapa is linked with Enmerkar
in one myth, he's associated with the first king, Alulu, in another, and Nungalparigal,
typically matched with Enmerkar, appears in a different position in other lists. This pattern
of recombination is evident in other traditions as well, such as the Sumerian king list, where
Itana, another hero who ascended to heaven, is also placed as the seventh king in a post-Diluvian
dynasty. This fluidity underscores the importance of understanding Mesopotamian scribal culture as
a whole, rather than seeking a single, unchanging narrative. The recurrent motif of a seventh figure
having a special divine encounter or revelation is a theme, rather than a strict rule, applied with
variations across different texts and traditions. While scholars like Vanderkam and Borger aren't
entirely wrong in drawing parallels between Mesopotamian figurines and Enoch, the reality
is more complex. No single-figure embodies the Seventh Seiji Archetype exclusively.
Instead, the pattern reflects the broader narrative and symbolic practices of Mesopotamian
scribal culture. The focus should be on the overarching role these figures play within this
culture, which often involves transgression or special interaction with the divine, as seen
in various texts, including a Neo-Assyrian prayer to Marduk, where Adapa's role might further
demonstrate this theme. The one whom he, in his fury, he honors Marduk, have mercy on your servant,
the sage, Lit Adapa, who take away Lord his guilt, remove his punishment, his mouth has
confessed the sin he committed. References to Adapa frequently highlight his wisdom and authority
in various texts, with his name literally equating to wise. Beyond wisdom, Adapa also embodies hubris,
notably in narratives where he appears as a transgressor who faces divine consequences,
such as in the beat-messery texts. Here, figures like Pyregal Nungal and Pyregal Abzu provoke gods,
leading to severe repercussions, illustrating the Apkalu's dual role as intermediaries between
divine and human realms. In a particular Neo-Assyrian prayer to Marduk, the speaker possibly aligns with
Adapa's transgressor aspect, suggesting a complex relationship with the gods. Through both their
wisdom and follies, figures like Adapa symbolize the intricate dynamics between heaven and earth
in Mesopotamian mythology. Adapa, in scholarly lists, scribal accounts of history, geography,
and the divine realm. Dive into the world of ancient scribes with the Essigilla Chronicle,
where Adapa, a figure shrouded in myth, steps out of his usual roles to deliver justice. This
isn't just any tale, it's a groundbreaking mix of historical chronicle, personal reflection,
and sage advice. Picture it as an ancient letter from one ruler to another, unfolding the history
of Mesopotamia with a focus on the worship of the god Marduk in the vibrant city of Babylon.
The story's core message is clear and ominous. Offend the city's deities, and your reign as king
will swiftly end. Central to this narrative is a simple yet profound ritual.
Clean the temple of Marduk and supply fish, and you'll secure your throne. Adapa, not just a mythic
figure, but also a model priest, embodies this ritual by providing for his god's temple.
What's fascinating is the connection between Adapa's priestly duties and the royal rituals
of later times. This isn't just about religious rites, it's about the power of piety and devotion
in shaping leadership. The tale takes a surprising turn when it's Adapa, the epitome
of wisdom and duty, who punishes the negligent king and merkar, not a god. This marks a significant
shift in how power and responsibility were perceived. The story of Adapa is more than
an ancient legend. It's a reflection on the evolution of leadership, where the qualities
of a wise priest become the standard for kings. The authority once thought to belong to the gods
shifts into the hands of those wise enough to wield it. The ancient city of Babylon was a hub
of religious activity, with its temples and shrines forming the bedrock of cultural and
spiritual life. Central to this was a text known as Tintir, essentially a directory of these sacred
spaces within the grand Isagila temple. This document, which became a foundational part
of scribal education for over a millennium, lists numerous shrines, including one particularly
intriguing entry. The Ketil Munna, designated as the place of the noble, where the son of
Owans, associated with Adapa, is said to sit in the esteemed seat of Anu, the god of heaven.
With its origins likely in the 12th century BCE and its relevance extending through the Persian
period, Tintir was not just a guide. It was a vital tool providing scholars with a mental map
of Babylon's divine landscape. Despite the potential changes over centuries, its description
of the city's spiritual geography remained a key educational text. Interestingly, while there are
other accounts of Adapa from this era, Tintir stands out because it's the most widespread and
actively used text that mentions him. In this most prominent of documents, Adapa, or perhaps his
descendant, is depicted in a position of extraordinary honor, enthroned beside the king of the gods.
This portrayal contrasts with other, less widely circulated narratives from the period,
highlighting Adapa's significance not just in myth, but in the very real and revered spaces
of Babylon. Moreover, the form U-Anum, used to refer to Adapa or his progeny in Tintir,
echoes the name found in later accounts by historians like Borosos, suggesting a continuity
and evolution of his story over time. Here, Adapa is more than a mythic figure. He's a cultural
hero akin to Enoch, credited with imparting crucial knowledge like writing and mathematics
to humanity. Tintir's depiction of Adapa places him at the heart of Babylon's religious and
cultural identity, reflecting his enduring importance and the evolving understanding
of his role over centuries. This text doesn't just map out physical spaces, it charts a significant
part of the spiritual and intellectual terrain of ancient Mesopotamian civilization. The Uruk
Apkalu list is a groundbreaking cuneiform document that places scholars alongside kings in the story
of Mesopotamian history, recognizing their significant contributions to the civilization's legacy.
In the time of King Ayalu, one was sage Apkalu. In the time of King Alalgar,
Wanduga was sage. In the time of King Ameluana, Enmeduga was sage. In the time of King Amegalana,
Enmegalama was sage. In the time of King Enem Yushungalana, Enmeboluga was sage. In the
time of King Dumuzi the Shepherd, Anenlilda was sage. In the time of King Enmeduranki,
Utuwabzu was sage. This document was discovered in the historical archives of the Resh Temple,
believed to have been constructed by the legendary figure Adapa in the ancient city of Uruk,
during the Seleucid Era. Precisely, it dates back to the 147th year of King Anciusius Vicerain,
around 133 BC. The discovery was made alongside various ritual texts pertaining to the Resh
Temple, revealing connections to Adapa. Notably, it links Adapa with the mythical figure Ayalu,
likely another name for Alalu, revered as the inaugural ruler of Adapa's hometown,
Eridu, as per the ancient Sumerian King List. This association is critical because it intertwines
Adapa's story with that of Alalu, who, in some narratives, is replaced by Etana,
another Ascendant to the heavens. This document is significant as it merges two major cultural
narratives. The list of seven Apkalu, sage-like figures from one source, and the first seven
kings from the Sumerian King List. This blending showcases an attempt to integrate specific ritual
knowledge into the broader historical narrative. Moreover, it reflects a wider cultural practice
of recording and honoring past wisdom and rulers. The most intriguing aspect of this discovery,
however, is its connection to a vastly different type of literature by Barrassos, a Hellenistic
author. Barrassos aimed to familiarize the Seleucid King Antiochus to a hundred Dushin,
with Babylonian culture through his work, the Babyloniaca. This text is a testament to the
preservation and transmission of Babylonian traditions into the Hellenistic period,
demonstrating remarkable consistency with the lists from the Uruk and Batmessiri texts.
Regrettably, the original text of Barrassos' work has not survived to the present day. Instead,
what exists are fragmented adaptations in later Christian writings, which have been modified
and reinterpreted several times to align with biblical narratives. This process of transmission
and alteration significantly impacts the authenticity and reliability of the information,
setting it apart from other ancient texts we've encountered. The remnants of Barrassos' work
are found primarily in medieval Armenian texts, translated from Eusebius, and Byzantine Greek
manuscripts, notably by Sinkelus. These sources, however, come with their own set of challenges.
As noted by contemporary scholars such as De Bruker in 2010, the texts are heavily influenced
not only by Christian viewpoints, but also by the Greek cultural lens through which Barrassos
initially presented his native Babylonian lore. This double layer of cultural reinterpretation,
first Greek, then Christian, necessitates a cautious and discerning approach to their study.
One of the more intriguing aspects of these accounts is their description of semi-divine
beings, particularly those resembling the fish apkalu, a type of sage associated with the
legendary figure Adapa from the earlier discussion. These beings are depicted with fish-like
characteristics, aligning with ancient Mesopotamian representations of wisdom and knowledge.
Notably, such descriptions are found in the works of Alexander Pauli Hister,
who claims to base his accounts on Barrassos' original text.
Never eating anything but teaching men the skills necessary for read.
In and for doing mathematics and for all sorts of knowledge,
it taught men all those things conducive to a settled and civilized life.
Since that time, nothing further has been discovered. At the end of the day,
this monster Ornus went back to the sea and spent the night.
The accounts differ about when he appeared, but one account correlates kings with semi-human sages.
During the reign of Ammonon, the Chaldean in this section listed as fourth, not first king.
The monster Ornus, the Anodotus, appeared from the Red Sea. Alexander Pauli Hister claims he appeared
in the first year, Barrassos after 40 Saroi, and Abidano says he was the second monster,
who appeared after 26 Saroi. Despite the variations and redactions in the texts
derived from Barrassos' work, researchers have identified a remarkable consistency
that points to his reliance on a Babylonian source closely related to the Uruk Apkalu list.
This list, a register of seven mythological sages, or Apkalu, aligns significantly with one found
in Barrassos' narratives, notably beginning with Uon, Owans, and concluding with Utuabzu.
This correlation was first recognized by Dr. van Dijk in 1962, and has since been
a pivotal point in understanding the intertextual connections between these ancient documents.
However, a notable discrepancy arises concerning the final Apkalu, Utuabzu.
In the versions preserved by Sincelis and Eusebius, this figure is replaced with names like
Otacon and Anodophos, which show a closer resemblance to the second Apkalu, Uanduga,
and potentially to U and Adapa. This has led some scholars to speculate and perhaps
wishfully interpret these names as variants of Utuabzu, yet as pointed out by Dr. Geller in 1997,
when the rules for transliterating Sumerian and Akkadian into Greek are applied.
These names align more convincingly with U and Adapa. This observation introduces an
intriguing possibility. By the Seleucid Period, the figure of U and Adapa might have been divided
into two distinct entities, U-An and U-Anodapa, with the latter being revered as the Seventh Sage
and described in contemporary Bit-Messere rituals as ascending to heaven. This potential
splitting of identities adds a layer of complexity and depth to our understanding of how these
ancient figures were transmitted and transformed over time and across cultures.
Adapa in Myth
Adapa's journey was more than a celestial exploration. It also involved a descent into
the underworld alongside the notorious King and Merkar, whom he is said to have cursed
in other tales. The saga of Adapa and Merkar opens with a mysterious figure,
possibly Adapa, lamenting to the god Marduk. Despite the divine acknowledgement of this sorrow,
there appears to be no assistance provided, and Merkar, the ruler of Uruk, becomes entwined in
this narrative as he and Adapa venture beneath the earth and into a tomb, potentially engaging
in forbidden rituals of communicating with the dead. An ancient corpse from remotest times.
He made a terrible clamour in the palace. They went down nine cubits in the depths.
Nine cubits of earth they went down. He, they destroyed the door of the tomb.
Following the descent into the underworld, the narrative resumes with a grim scene.
Enmerkar and Adapa, having encountered something dreadful,
urgently instruct a smith to reseal the tomb. Later, Adapa's anxiety is palpable as he seeks
confirmation from the smith that the tomb's door remains firmly closed.
This story significantly contributes to the evolving character of Adapa in two main ways.
Firstly, it situates him in the mythic past as an associate or advisor to King and Merkar of
Uruk, thus weaving him into the legendary tapestry of ancient times. Secondly, it presents
a new variation of Adapa, and by extension, the Apkalu, a group of sage advisors,
overstepping cosmic boundaries, disturbing the realms of heaven, hell, life, and death.
Unlike his previous celestial disruptions, here, Adapa appears to unsettle the underworld,
accompanied by a king also notorious for crossing divine boundaries.
The exploration of Adapa's roles in Mesopotamian literature leads back to the intricate narrative
of the Adapa and the South Wind myth, offering a chance to understand his depiction in the
broader context of traditions involving the Apkalu, an ascension to heaven. This approach
shifts the focus from the story's plot to its historical and cultural implications,
including ritual practices, scholarly traditions, and the changing dynamics of the era.
Adapa's portrayal as a ritual practitioner par excellence is central to the text. His role
is so vital to the divine rituals that his absence would disrupt the very sustenance of the gods.
This depiction might seem mundane, reflecting a predictable and dutiful servant, yet it's his
unwavering dedication to ritual and his profound connection to the gods Eya and Eridu that position
him as a formidable figure. His ability to perform rituals flawlessly not only combats demons,
but also poses a potential threat to the divine hierarchy itself. From ancient records,
we understand that Adapa was a symbolic figure that exorcists in the old Babylonian period
aspired to emulate. Dr. Falkenstein in 1931 identified declarations like as legitimization
formulae. These statements not only claim the speaker's right to perform certain rituals,
asserting their direct connection to Eridu, a hub of arcane knowledge and magic, but also
associate them with Adapa, the archetypal ritualist. This association suggests that the
speaker has the requisite skill to flawlessly complete an exorcism, a critical claim considering
the Mesopotamians, acute awareness of the potential for ritual failure and its grave consequences.
In the realm of ritual performance, such statements emphasize the necessity of being a
qualified individual and performing correctly. Adapa in this context is akin to the patron saint
of Mesopotamian ritual, setting the standard for expertise and execution. Thus, the prerequisites
for conducting these sacred acts become embedded within the texts themselves. However, the preservation
of these declarations in ritual texts rather than performance records indicates they were more
aspirational ideals than documented realities. This distinction points to a broader exploration
of how retual practitioners identified with and a spirit to the west dumb and expertisee
of figures like Adapa. The narrative surrounding Adapa also significantly highlights his close
relationship with the god Ea, a theme recurrent in rituals, myths, and even political propaganda.
In the best-preserved Neo-Assyrian version of the story, there's a deliberate ambiguity in the text
that blurs the distinction between Ea and Adapa, suggesting a deep connection or even a unity
between them. This is evident where the text could imply that Ea Apkalu of Eridu
was created by Adapa, though the context more likely suggests the reverse. Furthermore, the
narrative equates Adapa's commands with those of Ea, a motif recurring in exorcism rituals
where the words of the ritual performer are deemed as authoritative as those of a deity.
This legitimization strategy is exemplified in the Marduk Ea type, incantations, where the exorcist
recite spells purportedly transmitted directly from Ea, symbolizing a unity between the speakers
and the gods words. Similarly, the verse account of Nabhanidus portrays Adapa as possessing complete
knowledge of all creations by Ea Mumu, indicating a near cognitive identity between the sage
and the deity. However, this close association with Ea isn't without its complexities. Texts,
like the beat misery, emphasize that the Apkalu, including Adapa, often engaged in acts of transgression
and overreaching, such as the one Apkalu who supposedly brought the goddess Ishtar down from
heaven. In Adapa's case, this theme of transgression extends to a tension between him and not just
the god Anu, but also his own patron Ea. This nuanced portrayal reflects a relationship of both
deep connection and inherent conflict, mirroring the complex dynamics between divine beings
and their earthly counterparts in Mesopotamian mythology.
In the myth of Adapa, the protagonist's verbal prowess is not just a tool to confront adversaries,
but holds the potential to subdue all winds, indicating a profound level of control and power.
A critical, yet previously unexplored aspect of Adapa's dilemma might stem from the intrinsic
connection between the winds and the gods, particularly the south winds consistent identification
with Ea, Adapa's patron deity. This wind embodies more than a mere natural force. It's a supernatural
entity with a distinct personality deeply linked to Ea. The south wind, pivotal to Mesopotamian
agriculture, yet also listed among the chief demons, represents a dualistic force of both
destruction and nourishment. Its association with Ea extends from ancient Sumerian texts
to later Neo-Assyrian writings, where it's frequently referred to as beloved or standing
before Ea and in. Some instances, even equated with Ea himself, Adapa's act of subduing the south
wind isn't just a magical feat, it's an attack on a being identified with his own god, the master
of magic. This action paradoxically aligns Adapa, the archetypal exorcist, with Pazuzu, a demon
known for breaking the wings of the wind. This complex layering suggests that Adapa's
ritualistic prowess and his assault on the south wind inadvertently position him in a
contentious relationship with his own divine patron. Moreover, the two known versions of the
Adapa myth that include ritual elements potentially cast Adapa himself in a demonic light. The endings
of these versions, particularly in the older edition represented in Ms. D, might be interpreted as
incantations aimed at mitigating the chaos unleashed by Adapa's actions. This interpretation
adds a layer of moral and mythological complexity, painting Adapa not just as a sage and ritualist,
but as a figure whose actions straddle the line between divine wisdom and transgressive force.
The narrative of Adapa encompasses his two notable deeds,
incapacitating the wind and his ascent to heaven. The text continues, using a similar syntax and
reminiscent language to the Atrahasis, suggesting that Adapa might be implicated in the origin of
diseases. Just as in Atrahasis, wind imagery is used, and the term Tebu associated with the
emergence of malevolent forces and often linked to the south wind and Adapa's act is mentioned.
The narrative ends with a curse, possibly directed at Adapa himself, leaving readers
to ponder his role in these calamities. Adapa stands as a symbol of the potential dangers inherent
in ritual performance and linguistic prowess. Within the Mesopotamian scribal tradition,
the primary myth of Adapa presents a paradoxical figure who embodies both absolute obedience
and a latent threat, his mastery over words and rituals consistently pushing beyond their intended
limits. The most resonant aspects of the Adapa and the south wind myth in relation to ritual and
broader cultural narratives are his flawless execution of rituals and the inherent disruptive
power of those very acts. This ambivalence reflects a broader Mesopotamian contemplation
of ritual as both a source of disease and a means of cure, highlighting the dual nature of power.
Politically, Adapa's narrative portrays a servant whose perfect allegiance poses a risk
of usurping his master's authority. Historically, this mirrors the actual shift
in Mesopotamian society, where scholars symbolized by figures like Adapa,
rose in prominence and influence, potentially challenging the established order, a history
of Adapa and the Apkulu. The narrative of Adapa reflects an evolving history of identifications
expanding from the old Babylonian period onward. Initially, Adapa epitomized the ideal ritual
performer and speaker, a model for experts in the field. By the time of the Sumerian texts
from this period, Adapa was already a persona utilized by exorcists for banishing demons,
and the oldest rendition of his myth concludes with an incantation, tying him intrinsically
to ritualistic practices. Adapa's role in myth and ritual portrays him as a mediator,
navigating the realms between heaven and earth and blurring the lines between the human and the
divine. In the Udug-Tul type rituals, he is invoked as a messenger for the god of exorcism,
Asaluhi, illustrating his early personification and significance. This representation of Adapa
continued to evolve and spread, finding its way into Arcadian scholarly texts of 14th century Egypt.
Centuries later, in the Neo-Assyrian period, Adapa's image underwent a significant transformation
as he began to be paralleled with the king in royal inscriptions and correspondence.
The king's actions, wisdom, and even familial attributes were likened to those of Adapa.
This comparison wasn't merely about the individual, but reflected the evolving self-image and persona
of the Assyrian king as a figure deeply connected to the divine, embodying special piety and ritual
prowess. In the broader context of Arcadian texts, wisdom is often associated with the king,
particularly in relation to acts of temple building and restoration, blending political
power with religious devotion. This backdrop sets the stage for Adapa's emergence as a figure
of political significance. This connection is epitomized by Asurbanipal, the scholarly Neo-Assyrian
king who adopted the virtues of Adapa, known for his reading of cuneiform, his scholarship,
and his interpretation of astronomical omens. Adapa's role underwent a significant expansion
in the first millennium BCE, largely due to the rise of pseudopigraphy and a growing emphasis
on writing and authorship, as noted by Dr. van der Torne in 2007.
This period didn't see the abandonment of Adapa's old exorcistic functions.
These continued to be evidenced in texts such as the Udughul and Lamashtu series. However,
a novel utilization of Adapa emerged in the form of letters containing incantations,
which resonated with a wider Near Eastern literary tradition of divine correspondence.
These medical incantations traced their lineage back to earlier dialogues between gods in Sumerian
texts, indicating a long-standing tradition of divine communication.
Dr. van der Torne points out a significant cultural shift in Mesopotamia, an increased focus
on the concept of writing and authorship, particularly evident in the first millennium BCE.
This is reflected in the evolution of Adapa's image, from catalogs listing authors and ancestors
to letters used as a medium for conveying supernatural knowledge. This period
marks the transition from oral traditions to written communications attributed to renowned
figures like Adapa, thereby elevating him to the status of a pseudopigraphic author.
During the Neo-Assyrian period, a theoretical shift began where sages, previously confined to
myth and ritual, started to be historicized. This transition fully materialized in the
Seleucid period after the end of Native Mesopotamian kingship. The human sages, or Umanu,
first appeared in Neo-Assyrian king lists, and the supernatural Apkelu were named and associated
with legendary and historical kings in the beat-messery incantation fragments.
While Mesopotamian kings retained their thrones, Apkelu remained within the realms of myth and
ritual. However, after the cessation of Native kingship, these non-human supernatural sages,
including figures like Adapa, began to be integrated into historical records. They were
listed alongside rulers in king lists, and Adapa himself was attributed with the temple-building
activities traditionally reserved for kings in places like. Uruk demonstrating a profound shift
in how these ancient figures were perceived and remembered in Mesopotamian culture.
The evolving nature of king lists in Uruk, transitioning from royal to scribal genealogies,
underscores their dynamic role as political documents. This shift aligns with the changing
power dynamics in Mesopotamian culture, particularly under the new rulers. This
reordering reflects a deeper societal valorization of scholarly and scribal heritage over traditional
royal lineage, indicating a significant cultural and political shift.
He correlation between the elevated status of sages in historical texts and the prominence
of the Ashipu exorcist in society becomes particularly evident during the Seleucid period
in Babylonia. The Ashipu, among various priest experts, emerges as a notably important figure,
even more frequently mentioned than astrologers across various Hellenistic
Babylonia centers. This prominence suggests a growing respect and need for their expertise
and roles within society. In Seleucid, Uruk, a tangible connection between Mesopotamian ritual
practitioners and the mythic Apkalu, especially Adapa, starts to crystallize. The ritualists
not only operated a vast shrine attributed to Adapa, incorporating him into their rituals and
genealogies, but they also adopted the Apkalu as a personal emblem. As Dr. Walenfels noted
in 1993, it seems that a scribe would typically adopt an Apkalu seal upon achieving full status
within the temple hierarchy. While these seals weren't exclusively used by scribes,
their prevalent association with them is undeniable. This practice reflects a broader
trend where apprentice scholars, as they advanced in their careers, would assume the image of the
mythic sage. It symbolizes their transition into a position of wisdom and authority,
paralleling the journey of the Apkalu and Adapa themselves. This trend illustrates not just a
personal or professional milestone, but a deep cultural connection to the mythic past,
where the lines between the historical and the divine were intricately woven into the identities
of the scholars of the time. What have we learned?
Mesopotamia is known for its two detailed narratives of heavenly assent, the epic of King
Itana and the myth of the sage Adapa. The story of Itana riding to the heavens on the back of an
eagle was a well-established motif by the Old Babylonian period, subject to various interpretations
and revisions over time. However, as the story became more fixed, Itana's character seemed to
diminish in cultural significance. In the realm of ritual, references to Itana are primarily found
in Old Babylonian Sumerian texts, with his presence fading significantly in later periods.
During the Old Babylonian period, Itana held considerable religious importance,
often invoked in Sumerian prayers and associated with the underworld alongside the figure of Gilgamesh.
His religious significance, however, was largely posthumous. As a mortal king, Itana had to die
and secure a place in the underworld to become ritually relevant in the human realm.
Similar to Gilgamesh, he was primarily called upon to act within the nether world.
Following the Old Babylonian era, Itana largely fades into obscurity, remembered mainly as a
spectral figure of ancient lore. In contrast, Adapa's narrative endured and flourished throughout
Mesopotamian history. Despite being mortal in certain myths, Adapa's legacy as a semi-divine.
Sage, with ambiguous origins, allowed him to maintain an active role beyond his lifetime.
His ability to be invoked in medical emergencies and political discourse ensured his continued
relevance. Adapa was not just a character in literary texts.
He was a living part of Mesopotamian culture, personified by scribes who saw in him a hero
and a model. His presence in rituals and historical texts, more so than in literary narratives,
defines the enduring outline of his life and significance in the Mesopotamian tradition.
The adaptability of Adapa as a persona to be adopted, particularly by kings, underscores his
profound impact on Mesopotamian culture. Far more kings chose to align themselves with Adapa
rather than Itana, highlighting Adapa's prominence in neo-Assyrian royal propaganda.
While there is no direct evidence of kings adopting his role in rituals, the extensive
comparisons drawn between kings and Adapa, especially by rulers like Asurbanipal,
indicate that such analogies went beyond mere flattery. Asurbanipal's inscriptions elaborate
on his parallels with the sage, emphasizing his scholarly prowess, his understanding of cosmic
secrets, and his esteemed place among the wise. Claims of dissent from sages and Adapa in royal
correspondence further illustrate how deeply entwined these figures were with the royal identity
and persona. Adapa's significance extends beyond his role in myths and rituals. His story
reflects the broader historical shift in how ancient traditions were adapted into new genres
and reshaped to serve evolving purposes. Following the neo-Babylonian period, as the
traditional role of court scholars in producing royal propaganda and politically oriented knowledge,
waned, they sought new avenues for their expertise. This period saw the emergence of new genres
and the repurposing of old traditions for different ends, such as the Uruk prophecy,
which utilized political tactics to promote the worship of Anu in Uruk.
The rise of Adapa in cosmic and architectural narratives, particularly in the context of
the Resh Temple, is part of this broader transformation, the construction of the Resh
Temple, featuring the largest ziggurat ever discovered in Babylonia,
occurred during a Hellenistic revival led by the Seleucid rulers and priestly governors of Uruk.
This era, long after the fall of Babylonian kingship, demonstrates the enduring legacy
and continual reinvention of Mesopotamian traditions, with figures like Adapa at the
forefront of this cultural and scholarly evolution. The revision and evolution of Mesopotamian
tradition gained momentum after the loss of native kingship during the Persian period
and flourished further under the Seleucids. The construction of the Resh Temple, a monumental
structure unprecedented in scale in Babylonia, attributed to Adapa and initiated by a governor
of priestly descent, marks a significant moment in this transformative era. In this context,
Adapa was not only associated with the physical structure of the temple, but also integrated
into its rituals, particularly the New Year's festival, and was even included in a contemporary
king list from Uruk. The Seleucid rulers seem to encourage a renaissance of traditional religious
practices and forms in the ancient Mesopotamian cities, particularly Uruk and Babylon. This
revival might be perceived as an invention of traditions by the new rulers to support their
ideological agenda. However, it's essential to consider that the natives themselves,
not just the colonizers, played a crucial role in this process. The newly formed memories and
roles of sages like Adapa incorporated and reinterpreted ancient material into a new cultural
and architectural paradigm, symbolized by the grandeur of the Resh Temple and its ziggurat.
The exact carnitivé and ritual mechanisms behind this identification with figures like
Adapa during the Hellenistic period remain elusive, while exorcists might claim to embody
mythical figures and incantations are replete with assertions of identity, the historical,
personal, and cognitive implications of these ritual roles are not fully documented. The absence
of personal accounts or diaries leaves a gap in, understanding the subjective experiences
of these ritual practitioners. However, while the inner experiences of these ancient scholars
remain beyond our reach, the scripts for these experiences are accessible by examining texts
related to self-identification and ritual participation in both Judea and Mesopotamia.
It's possible to understand how ancient religious traditions were invoked and adapted to contemporary
contexts. This approach can reveal the positions performers assumed when interacting with tradition,
offering insights into how a scholar might ritually connect with their written culture,
and in doing so embody and perpetuate the legacy of heavenly sages like Adapa.
What captivates the mind when considering the era leading up to Enoch is the remarkable spread
of this literature, even in the absence of its original patrons.
From the dethroning of the King of Babylon to the rise of Persia and the advent of Alexander the
Great's Hellenistic Era, the temples stood tall and the priesthoods flourished, their influence
expanding in certain regions. In the absence of a central monarch, the scribes themselves sometimes
assumed the central role, becoming the custodians of knowledge and authority.
As the late Jonathan Z. Smith astutely observed, the emergence of apocalypticism seemed intrinsically
tied to the decline of native kingship, a noteworthy artifact, the King List from Uruk,
catalogues the names of the early kings alongside their esteemed sages.
These sages were not only repositories of secret knowledge, but also wielders of healing arts
and the power to exorcise demons. Among these malevolent entities, one finds the infamous
Lamash II, a demon known for abducting and causing harm to newborns in ancient Mesopotamia.
Intriguingly, this figure serves as the ancestral precursor to Lilith, a prominent character in
Jewish law, often portrayed as Adam's supposed first wife. In a society steeped in misogyny,
the moral of this cautionary tale echoes, refrained from engaging in contentious arguments with your
husband, particularly when the dispute revolves around matters of intimacy. I trust you grasp
the underlying message. In the midst of this rich jumble, one figure emerges as a hero in the face
of Lamash II's malevolence, Adapa. Revered in their tradition, Adapa possessed the rare ability
to ward off the menacing demon. Illustrated in a remarkable plaque dating from the 9th to 7th
century, we witness the sage Adapa, adorned in an attire reminiscent of a fish, valiantly
protecting patients or expectant mothers from the demon's harm. Delving into the complex depths
of ancient Mesopotamian lore, unveils a world where scribes rose to prominence,
demonic forces loomed, and heroes arose to confront them. It is a testament to the intricacies of
historical narratives, where the interplay of power, mythology, and cultural beliefs
shape the collective consciousness of civilizations. The intriguing question at hand
revolves around the interactions between Juden scribes and Mesopotamian traditions,
particularly considering the striking resemblances between the narratives of Adapa and Enoch.
Both figures emerge as celestial messengers, hailing from primordial times, and both become
personified by scribes. Despite the lack of extensive verbal overlap between the two, scholars
have noted profound structural parallels, prompting further exploration into the potential
connection between Enoch and the earlier Adapa myth. It is noteworthy that both Mesopotamian
and Judean societies underwent similar transformations, including the loss of
native kingship and the conquests by the Persians and Alexander the Great. In both contexts,
scribal cultures experienced comparable changes. Professor Jonathan Bendove has drawn attention
to the remarkable similarity between the astronomical knowledge present in Enoch
and the astronomical knowledge associated with Adapa in Mesopotamian literature.
These conceptual affinities, though distinct, beg the question of how they can be connected.
During the late Persian period, the same individuals held positions of power in both
institutions, namely those who controlled the temples and education. In Babylon, education
centered around Aramaic parchment writing scribes who gained prominence due to the
native Babylonian families' revolt against the Persian rulers. Consequently, new scribes
assumed control of Babylonian temples towards the end of the Persian period. At this juncture,
Babylonian scholarship thrived, with scribes trained in standardized Aramaic. Simultaneously,
these scribes became the teachers of Hebrew scribes, instructing them in the art of writing.
Thus, it becomes evident that Hebrew scribes during the Hellenistic period adopted an Aramaic
script as evident in their written works. The scholarly dominance of Aramaic practitioners
extended throughout the Persian and Hellenistic empires, leaving a significant imprint on the
intellectual landscape. This is corroborated by the presence of Aramaic Levi documents in the
Dead Sea Scrolls, which employ a base 60-mathematical system rooted in Sumerian tradition, as well as
Babylonian-style astronomy. Shared training among scholars, naturally engenders shared literary ideas,
further blurring the boundaries between distinct cultural and textual traditions.
Interestingly, the Adapa myth from Mesopotamia and the concept of the Apkalu played a significant
role in influencing the authors of the Enochian literature. The concept of the Apkalu, known as
the Seven Sages in Mesopotamian mythology, played a formative role in shaping the imagery and ideas
within the Enochian literature. It's not a coincidence that Enoch is the seventh generation
from Adam. Conclusion
