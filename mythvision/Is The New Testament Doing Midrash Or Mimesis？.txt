Ladies and gentlemen real quick video with doctors Dennis R. McDonald and Richard C. Miller
I was asked by someone who's been following meth-fishing for a while
You know they see what's called midrash and maybe we can let you guys explain what that is and then there's memesis
Which is a pioneered idea that Dennis McDonald if you look on Google what memesis criticism is
He's the guy behind the name
I wanted to ask just a simple question and that is is the New Testament doing midrash or
Is it doing memesis and that's kind of a funny question because I'm wondering if it does both
If you don't mind Dennis take us off on what you think's going on there
What's the difference between memesis and midrash and is the New Testament doing both?
Oh, the New Testament definitely is doing both
Unfortunately biblical scholars have been more attentive to midrash than they have to memesis
And there are reasons for that and we've talked about that in a different podcast
But the first thing we need to do I think Derek is to determine what we mean by memesis and what we mean by midrash
They are both intertextual projects. They are all both creative
but memesis is interested in taking a recognized
text and
changing it for certain reasons in order to
Do what I would call
Synchrosis what the Greeks call synchrosis a comparison of characters so that Jesus is
Superior to Moses if it's a memesis of Deuteronomy, let's say or Jesus is
Superior to Hector they both die heroically, but Jesus rises from the dead that kind of thing that is a very different project
from midrash
Midrash really doesn't have very many rules, but it has a tradition and it recognizes a
Text, but it doesn't try to imitate the text
It tries to interpret the text by aligning it with a different text or coming out with an alternative
interpretation of it in both cases though both memesis and midrash have to do with
Using a contested authority that is it could be Greek poetry in the case of memesis or it could be Jewish scriptures
in the case of midrash as a way of
Establishing for a community
What is going to be its dominant ideology or its leaders ship?
so when Paul for example engages in
Midrash, by the way, he doesn't you do a memesis when he's engaged in midrash
It's usually in a polemical context where
Scripture is being contested and he's giving his interpretation of it and applying it as an authority
an authoritative interpreter and
We know from his epistles that where there are other
Contenders to be
Authoritative interpreter in order to reshape their understanding of Torah
Let's say for example or community identity or the relationship to
Non-Jews so when I was the director for ten years at the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity
Claremont Graduate University where Richard got his
PhD by the way, I tried to put together a conference on
memesis and midrash because
Both of them are ancient
Intertextual projects that deal with contested authorities in a different ways
And I found it really impossible to pull that conference together because it was difficult to get
Scholars in these two fields to talk to each other
Reasonably there are funding issues as well. So that's what I would say that midrash is a
Intertextual project that isn't interested in imitating a text or challenging it or comparing characters
It's rather a way of reinterpreting an episode of mitzvah
Commandment in order to make it congenial to new
Situations and one way of doing it is to compare it with another
Biblical text that sometimes challenges it or reinterprets it
Or whatever midrash is less a science than an artistic game
One plays to re-scramble the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle in order to create a different image
It's got its own rules. I suppose but it's not easy to formalize
It really is more of a creative literary theological game
Did you want to add anything to that?
I would just say just the the bear observation
I think if you go back into these
Excerpts and quotes that are given in the New Testament from the classical Hebrew writings, you know
The Septuagint and the Alexx they enjoyed it
They were afforded an astonishing freedom and and creative creatively. We're drawing on this apparently
authoritative body of text in their cultic communities and I'm not sure to what extent it does not feel like
The authors and the early cult leaders were held to much standard in terms of what we would consider to be
Purely Jewish context, but we have these early cults within the urban centers in the Hellenistic world
communities that may not have been terribly interested in
Holding their leaders to certain Jewish standards of that day in terms of how they're handling those texts
But they they did I think take comfort if you read in Justin Martyr
This idea that that we're drawing on these older texts that they'd have this deep archaic
history to them and that was a
Comfort I think to the early communities that were there that their traditions that the
Religion that they were receiving the cult that they were investing themselves in was able to draw from these older roots in some way
To what extent were the leaders faithful to any of those texts? Well, that's where we come in with midrash, right?
We kind of give them that license there
But I think more work needs to be done to unpack does this compare how does this compare with what?
We would consider more normal if there is anything normal going on with midrash in early Jewish
Writing and thought at that time. I would say that I think we'd be what look I've taken with that
What what investigation I've had with that is that this would be maybe on the poor end of that spectrum?
If I think if we're fair and honest with ourselves
There are some creative moments, however that I think are a little bit more
What we would consider higher quality midrash in there
but I think more or less they were just using it as a license in order to draw on the earlier texts and
I would argue that the audience the those that were there reading and
Digesting and consuming these texts weren't we're not holding them to much standard in that regard
And so that's where my research has gotten to this point
