is history as we know it much younger than what we've been told by the mainstream scholarship.
Check out this show. I hope you guys enjoy. We're going to talk about chronology and
Fum Yonka's theory. Might have butchered his name there. Brought on interesting
guests with us today. I hope you guys show him some love and leave your comments.

We are MythVision. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Derek Lambert, your host. We're going
to be talking about something controversial. I want to go ahead and say up front. What we're
going to talk about is chronology and our history. The timeline of what we've been told
is the standard understanding of what we're supposed to believe when things happen
based off of the Roman model. I'm not going to steal your thunder because there's going to be
some interesting things here. We have a guest with us, Stephen Sorison. Am I pronouncing that
correct, brother? Sorenson. The person's name that he's going to talk about, I'm not even going to
attempt to pronounce. Stephen, talk a little bit about what you're going to talk about and what
led you into this. So what we're going to be talking about tonight is Famyanka's new chronology.
It's a theory that basically argues that the dawn of human civilization was about a thousand years
ago. I got into it just by studying history. I was at the time looking into American education,
educational history to figure out how our schoolhouses got to the way that they are,
from the single room schoolhouse to the massive, multi-complex high schools and schools that we
have today. I was going to do some books on that or something. I was looking into ancient history
and what were the earliest forms of school? When did people actually start to be like,
okay, everyone sit down in a circle. I'm going to be teaching you some math today.
Four plus four is eight and whatnot and stuff like that. While I was looking into that,
I stumbled across Famyanka's new chronology. After looking through it, I thought it was
really interesting enough to, I thought it had at least enough validity to argue it. I just was
looking out for people that had already looked into it. This theory came out in the, I think it
started in the 1970s and they were publishing on it in the 80s and 90s. It's been out for a few
decades here. I figured by now there would have been at least one person that had gone through it.
Understood it and either could show that it was legit or not. I haven't found that person yet,
so I'm just looking through it myself and seeing what kind of information is in it and
stuff like that. Stephen, if you don't mind me jumping in, what is, and I'm not even going to
pronounce his name right, but I'm going to butcher it right now, so I'm going to apologize, Famyanka's
theory, what is this thing? You said something that red flagged and like I have no clue what
this is, so I'm going into the dark. I just know that it's about chronology and I know that he says
that we're far, I guess history is technically far younger than what we've been told. Technically,
the timeline of Jesus Christ, 2,000 years ago is when he existed. This is saying something
no, it's far younger. It's not that long back ago that this stuff was happening or at least some
of this history. Can you give us more on the background of this because before people go,
this is flatter theory type stuff. This is like a complete nut job type position and some might
come to that conclusion. Can you build up something? Make some sense of this and I'm going to go
ahead and let you take over the screen here. Yeah, so what had happened was a NASA physicist
Robert Russell Newton was studying eclipses and he found that the eclipsed dates didn't
match up with the calculated dates and so what this led to Newton's discovery was that this is
the official narrative that has taken the leading theory is that the rotation of the earth, it
slows down or speeds up at different times and due to that the eclipsed dates are a little bit off.
Now the dates have been reconciled so if you download a star program for Celestial Objects,
I have a Redshift Pro on my phone. You can put in the date that you want to see so say you want to
go and see what the planets looked like in 200 BC on August 15th. You can put in those coordinates.
Those are all based off of the calculations that were created after Newton had figured out the
issues with the rotation of the earth I think is what it was, something like that. So
it's based off of astronomy, not flat earth stuff, but even if the earth was flat I
would imagine there'd be a way to accommodate for the observations that we make, but no this is
based off of a global earth and it makes use of spherical astronomy to be able to
figure out where the planets are. So when Femunca got his hands into this he was
analyzing the dates of these eclipses and what he discovered was that the descriptions of the
eclipses in the historical records could be accounted for in more recent dates and that
when they're accounted for in the more recent dates that the rotation of the earth that doesn't
have any weird fluctuations that need to be accounted for and put into the programs. So
the new chronology has a new lineup for these ancient eclipse dates to be able to see when
they could have possibly happened and all the dates fit into the last around 1100 years.
So that was kind of where Femunca had started was the analyzing of the eclipses. Then beyond that
he has used spherical astronomy to analyze zodiacs such as the ones in the tomb of Ramsey the fourth
and Ramsey the sixth. They both have zodiacs in their tombs that show where the planets are
at a certain time and based on what is it spherical astronomy that that's the practice that helps us
figure out where the planets would be at any given date for where you are on the globe. So
say you're in Italy you're in Rome you're looking up at the stars in the sky given that there's
not a whole lot of light pollution maybe you're using a telescope you can see where the planets
would be at that time and so if you were to fix the planets into a certain spot there's only so
many dates that those planets would be in that spot based on the calculations and based off there's
like in the new chronology they've analyzed over I think 50 different zodiacs historical zodiacs that
record the position of the planets and all of these 50 zodiacs they line up really perfectly
with the eclipse dates and with all the other research that they've done so that's kind of
interesting to look into. Another part of the new chronology is a textual analysis it's a
I think probably in the subgenre of historical comparison or comparative history and this is
a comparison of the there's a few different ways that they compared things they did a analysis of
the lengths of the rules of kings so however long Charlemagne reigned and Otto the first and
second and third and all the major kings lists basically of the Greek and Byzantine and Roman
empires as well as some of the datings for the Catholic popes there's quite a bit for the for
that part they also did an analysis on the manuscripts and the publication dates there's
really a lot to get into when you start talking about it. It sounds like it's more than one I mean
yeah it's got like there's a lot here so I guess this is just going to be the first part obviously
because we're going to have to do follow-ups where you're discussing particulars because as soon as you
get done with one oh well now we've got to look at another aspect and why there's more it's multifaceted
to come to conclusions that you're drawing um let's let's one new thing you brought up and and we
can go so many places I'm sure you brought up the the tomb of Pharaoh okay or multiple tombs
that they had zodiacs in um where do they date when does from I don't want to butcher his name
Fomienko Fomienko yeah you'll get that when does he date the pharaoh or this Egyptian pharaoh
because I think isn't what's the standard chronology this is going to be another good practice I think
if you if you would do this for us is to compare the chronology and say this is when we like standard
has said this is when he places it or approximately and based off of obviously all these factors you're
bringing up so yeah I have been doing that a little bit um here and there on some of the stuff
I'm pulling up these articles right now I have my computer right here uh so yeah I have actually a
article titled ancient Egyptian timelines comparisons and that was a study that I did
I went to 20 different websites um popular websites that you would find if you were to google something
you know um to if you were to go and google the uh Egyptian timelines uh or Egyptian periods of
history one of these links may pop up and so obviously it's not an exhaustive study of every
single um timeline that's out there but it's at least enough that you're if you were to go and look
at it there's a high chance that you're going to run across one of these sets of dates and um even
today these dates like for the pre-dynastic period one website dates it from 8 000 bc to 2700 bc
and another one dates it from 3100 to 2950 for the late period um so there's one a couple websites
do 3500 to 3100 um for that day list that is the dynastic period so there's quite a large gap between
8 000 to 2700 and 3500 that's like 4500 extra years that the people could have been there
um here let me pull the zodiac stuff real quick uh so yeah on the zodiacs the dates I think the
earliest one is in the 900s it's uh 969 and that is the tomb of seddy the first uh basically this is
how it's done is the uh tomb zodiac is analyzed and they see where the planets are in the different
houses so this is what the I think I still not clear exactly on the um terminology because I don't
actually really get to talk to anyone else about the zodiac specifically because it's such a niche
topic but the um basically the zodiac or the horoscope is that the sun is in leo the moon is in
leo venus is in vergo mars is in torus or gemini jupiter and torus satan and leo or vergo and mercury
and leo or vergo because the traditional astronomy uh placed those as the seven planets and so
there's only so many dates like not every single night are these planets going to be in those
uh spots and so through spherical astronomy you can calculate uh what the possible dates for
those spots would be and um so that's one route that they took to um try and date so uh the tomb
of seddy the first would have been uh I think they give an exact date august 14th through 16th of
969 but based on I just think there's a lot of different variables that um need to be accounted
for and so I think that possibly it's around that date um because you could potentially calculate
where the planets would be and say 10 years or however long it would take you to build a pyramid
say the pyramid takes five years to build uh they use their astronomers to calculate out five years
on where the planets will be on that date or but what the new chronology argues is that um
they put the date in there on the day of uh construction and so it commemorates the event
uh which is a which I think is legitimate uh a common practice too I would suspect
so let me ask you this um we have our chronology that is practically universally accepted today at
least it's very recent it's not like this has been going on for a very long time and when I say
practically when I say universal chronology I mean like based off this is based off of the roman
history of the roman catholic church correct ultimately I mean like isn't it like it's the
backbone is Greek history and then also influential is the roman popelist and um the roman kings yes
are important too but they're more so it's the greco roman history is the backbone of our chronology
okay and and was this uh this famyanka chronology in competition with the what became the
what we accept today universally is the correct chronology um what do you mean by competition
like uh like kind of like how we had um I guess uh today we just accept history to be
the chronology of adbc and what we have now was this something competitive with it in and it just
didn't become accepted because of political reasons that attach themselves to famyanka
no I don't think that many people have even heard about it um okay I sent when I first started
looking into it I sent out over 500 emails to professors across the world I got five responses
I get the you know they're professors so they're super busy and stuff and I may get more responses
in the future but I got five responses and out of the five responses I think one or two of them
had heard of it and neither of them had really looked into it and these are like professors of
history and they're um related fields of ancient or medieval history and so you if it was universally
denied by people you would think that at least they would have looked into it because to not
know anything about something and deny it is hardly uh hardly any proof of it being wrong um so
yeah I don't think that people have really looked into it all that much maybe it's more
popular in russia honestly there's not a whole lot of people that speak english that look into it
um or that are really qualified to be able to verify any of it so it'd be interesting to get
some experts to put their minds towards it at least maybe even just for a couple weeks you
know to dig into something to check it out but well I'm new like I really have no clue how to
begin really to figure out I mean you mentioned astral uh sorry the zodiac and yeah astrology no
astronomy right it's it's a little bit of both yeah okay so yeah it's taking ancient writings
that we know are old um and it's trying to figure out based off of things that are written as
observed in them and dealing with you know stars and constellations and things that would only take
place based off of the geometry you're describing here um spherical trigonometry I meant is that
what you said yeah it's uh it's actually it's spherical astronomy but that's based it's dependent
on spherical trigonometry which is fundamentally based on spherical geometry okay this is interesting
anyone who's watching this if you have any idea about this comment your thoughts because Stephen's
going to be looking but uh Stephen give me some more give me some more uh uh just tell me more
about it tell me more about this because I am left in the dark here I'm going to give you the full
screen again so yeah I've got quite a few of these uh zodiacs uh listed so far with their
planetary positions you were wondering like when are some of these pyramids built you know like um
I think the sphinx the common theory is that it was built around like 3500 years ago and the great
pyramid of Giza was around then too um I haven't looked into my Egyptian history for a minute so
if I'm wrong you know you gotta cut me some slack here but uh I'm pretty sure the pyramids are
considered to be in between like um 2000 to 4000 years old or give or take a little bit here and
there but so that's the traditional view uh with newer datings I think that people are pushing back
the dates uh they think that possibly there were pyramids um 6000 to 10 000 years ago I think part
of this is due to in the 1870s the um Anno Domini the or Anno Mundai dating since the beginning
of creation since Adam uh that kind of got overturned and so the historians and other people
weren't really forced to fit all of history into 6000 years so there's a possibility now that the
history is even longer um which is I think I think the extended history is in closer competition
with the taking universal hold than any shorter version of history uh I think yeah I can't even
think of any names for people that argue that kind of stuff but yeah it's the um anyone that's into
the ice age theories that uh there was a younger dryus period around 11 000 years ago that's
that's pushing the history of mankind a lot further back than where we were even in just the
19th century uh where you have an opinion on that do you do you disagree with the ice age
theory or you just disagree with their with their dating or what I mean I I'm still looking into it and
I think that based off of if if their fundamental facts are correct then yeah it's an interesting
theory but I also think that there's a lot of information that we still need to take into account
um especially given that we have like a percent of the ocean explored um I know we have like
maybe five percent of the ocean floor explored but the whole body of it I think we're still at
less than two percent um for understanding what's in there and uh I think that's a really
important part of earth science to kind of get that um on top of that with just the historical
records um there's some things in the records that I think are taken for granted and I mean if
they're true then uh it's an interesting theory but I think there's a lot more variables that need
to be taken into consideration uh before you put down a serious mark on when an ice age was
this is uh the ice age theories are actually kind of interesting the the traditional view
for a little while in the Renaissance and leading up to the 1870s was I think that this I might
butcher this but it's either that it was held that the earth started out as like a molten ball
of lava and it's been consistently cooling down since then or it started out as ice and I think
it was the molten ball of lava cooling first because the ice ages thing for the now it's
considered that it started out super super cold and it's been warming up ever since and um I think
that potentially maybe it's explained a little bit just by reactionaries and uh people were like
oh yeah no it's not a molten ball of lava cooling down it's a block of ice that's warming up and
stuff like that and it got overturned pretty quick but um I could get more I could get more educated
on that uh to speak about it in more detail I've I've just done some reading on it and uh looked
into some of the people that uh were coming up with the ideas I think the ice age ideas just
started in like the 18th or uh maybe 17th centuries that people started coming up with that so something
that that you mentioned in passing and didn't make a big deal out of it but you said um you think that
some of the literature you know from way back is maybe overlooked and I wanted to probe you on that
because because something I think uh you might be hinting at is for me myth vision is about trying
to figure out mythology trying to understand is there a guy there is this not a guy did this
really happen in history did this not really happen in history and at the end of the day
I don't know I mean it's okay though because that's what I do I love to just kind of get
variety of thoughts and I've heard even like Randall Carlson who's a catastrophist who's
known for the ice age theory and and he even bucks up against the mainstream scientists
in terms of a lot of things pertaining to the ice age and the dating of things and he talks
about the great year a lot which deals with astrology and astronomy and in ways of the ancient
world used a a great year kind of um what appears to be like a calendar where they would keep track
of ages um now something I wanted to ask you do you think there's some validity I mean at the
at the end of the day these stories are written right are they just completely hocus pocus written
or was there possibly some of these Atlantis type area places and would that touch on some
of this dating at all or what do you think my current view on the situation is uh I lean more
towards the new chronology just for the sake of arguing it to try and get any sort of educated
response back to it because there's really just not a whole lot of talk about it again in the
English speaking communities at least there's a lot of Russian forums but I can only read those
with the google and microsoft translate features um so yeah I'm trying to get more people to talk
about it in English but so I lean towards it I also think I lean towards it too because of I
think it's valid and that it has some merit and um yeah I my my current view is that basically
on the topic of myth it's like fundamentally it's a massive global game of telephone and um
the as the people spread out over the last thousand years the stories got shifted before
they got written down and so by the time that they got written down they were already a bit
different but the underlying themes are still consistent and uh there were people that picked
up on this like uh Carl Jung who based his archetypes theory off of it um he've you know
he thought it was a psychological thing and maybe it is if the extended timeline is correct but I
think that the telephone game is a much easier explanation it makes a lot more sense uh that
you know you told an event happened the information got spread out and uh as it got spread out to
different areas it got received differently and parts were changed here and there uh like a
fishing tail you know it always gets a little bit bigger every time you tell it again I caught a
I've seen a 20-pound bass I was gonna say like I've actually watched videos you can google this
right now they they have them like two minute videos and it's amazing this guy who's the
instructor starts out he grabs this he you know room room and then he honk honk and then he turns
then he just lifts one leg literally like four parts that's it like four simple actions and he
tells the next guy and there's like 30 people they get through by the time that line was done
in two minutes through 30 people the most insane dances they're doing at the end and you can go
right back to the beginning and look at this guy simple room room honk turn lift one leg and like
at the end they're doing the wiggle and they're doing the head like you don't even know what
you're doing and at first you know he's riding a motorcycle honk turn and he's moving his leg
like hitting the gas or something you know we're doing a break or something like at the end you're
not on a motorcycle anymore you are literally dancing on a strip pole or something like we
don't know what you're doing and uh I get what you're saying it's a similar thing as a phone game
but um so yeah I would I would assume that that right there is more likely explanation than all
of us inherently have this god complex in our psyche and we're just creating these myths because
we identify with them um I think that's actually been the christian message for a very long time
when they try to and I had the recent show you saw that with uh right yeah that was dr price you
know and he's like yeah they try to say that uh the reason all these other myths look like christianity
is that there's an inherent yeah and you discuss that and he doesn't buy into that he says they're
borrowing or sharing other ideas but noticed they're not the same so so this is yeah that's
another thing that got me into femencus new chronology is that um I was raised christian
I don't identify as that anymore right um I was looking into the there's this list on the internet
of like all these different older religions that christianity got its stories from like
egypt proverbs and hindu myths and stuff like that and um it was an impressive list I came across
it when I was like 17 or 18 and um I was looking into that at the same time that I came across the
new chronology and so the new chronology says that christianity is the basis of all the other
religions all these stories are based off of this christ character um fundamentally and uh so I'm
like okay well this is the exact opposite of this where it says that all these other cultures came
together to form this one and after looking through the new chronology you know I I can understand
why they would argue that but at the time I was like kind of putting my head around it and I guess
it does kind of make more sense that there would with the telephone game and what you were just
talking about the motorcycle guide turning into a flying carpet with a baboon or something um
it would make more sense that it was one core story that spun out into these different branches
then all these different branches culminated into one strong current um well it kind of
reminds me of the tower of babel so to speak I mean honestly like they had one you know one
language or one story so to speak and next thing you know there's all these other languages there's
all these other things so yeah in the new chronology the tower of babel is going to be a story about
the empire and the rise and fall and how when it was created you know the tower of babel is supposedly
one of the greatest architectural engineering and scientific artistic humanistic uh buildings of
all time they built it extremely massive they decorated all the walls and halls of with the
greatest art and furniture and stuff like that uh supposedly you know from the records but um this
in the new chronology it's that they built this magnificent kingdom and it fell apart and uh the
languages started crumbling and nobody could understand each other and it just grew so rapidly
and god smited them because the common people were trying to become like the royal people
so this is interesting what you're doing is interesting and this is so focused in and this
is we can get lost this can get you lost yeah but what you're saying here if I'm gonna like let me
just leap somewhere let me leap to Atlantis okay Atlantis ends up dying from a flood the gods were
displeased the people became they didn't follow the morals of the gods etc etc flood boom overnight
bam this similar flood theme plays as part in a variety of different stories I'll just call them
that for the sake of argument with people who might actually hold to these stories they might say
these stories are historical or some might say no these are stories that are mythology or no these
are theology or no they're allegory of real history or historical fiction whatever astrophiology
right and I think there's aspects of all of this stuff in it I really do I don't think it's one thing
but it's complex and what you said it just kind of makes me think of how maybe there's all there
was an overarching kind of story that did get passed around and it got jumbled by different cultures
and different areas who may have experienced different things and told these stories and
passed these stories on to different you know in different ways and now it's almost reminds me that
it's the same type of bone structure so to speak as the other stories and that's what like I deal
with a lot of people today who come on the show who are speaking about you know syncretism or the
ideas that there's synchronizing systems of thought in other ancient world ancient worldviews to
Christianity and we have people who are historicists who say no nice try Jesus is not a parallel to
Osiris or Jesus is not a parallel to a dying rising god etc etc and they're out there I'm
going to be hosting one here shortly but at the end of the day is that really the case or is it
like by what standards are they not parallel or compared do they have to be identical for you to
say those parallel I got called I got called a fruit loop for thinking Joseph and Jesus are
parallel and and like the depth at which we went into this story you're a fruit loop dude what are
you doing no that's too much over you're over parallel parallelomania it's the cop out now yeah
like okay you're drawing too much too many parallels for my own comfort therefore you're going crazy
with parallelisms you draw the line but anyway I didn't want to ravage all off I think it's
interesting is there other sources that talk about the power Bible having all that stuff in it because
I know that the biblical one or at least the one that we have in the Old Testament per the
Christian or the Hebrew Bible according to Jews that one doesn't go into like there's arts and
there's all this stuff in there but where is that written is there I have to look into that again
that's stuff that I haven't looked into for a few years here okay and it might be Jewish there might
be some type of Jewish rabbis who's espoused or someone mentioning that that may not be the
biblical source itself but like you said you know it you could you can really magnify into some
topics here and there's only so much time in the day to get through it so there's some areas that
I really have dug into and I feel like I've gotten as far as I can as far as like analyzing what's
out there and understanding it but the tower of Babel is not one of those areas of right I always
do this I do this every time we find something we get lost into it so all right take us back let's
ground real quick because I know your time is limited let's let's focus on this theory okay
and the human history as we know it going back to the Egyptians and all has actually according
to the new chronology taken place within the last thousand years it's not three thousand it's not
four thousand it's not five it's not yeah based off the building structures everything that we see
these things that are 3,500 years old or 5,000 years old supposedly it's all within a thousand years
so yeah if you want to get into real specifics here Jesus Christ the character that the biblical
Jesus is based on was born 867 years ago so we're in 867 AD and prior to that we almost
had no records of what happened that was it was really one of the first major events that went
down and got recorded and spread throughout the empire right prior to a I would imagine a population
boom okay question because this everything we're the new chronology is going to create you know
criticisms and questions I think it should create more questions and and get some scholars so if
you're somebody watching the show and you know someone who's a professional in this field that
may be willing to join on the show to discuss these things please do reach out okay I'm gonna
make sure my email is down in the description Steven also is reachable I would say educate
yourself on this because I'm not going to argue or debate it I don't know it I don't know it well
enough but I do want to ask you a question does does the astrological and the astronomy
chronology concept that they bring does that bring more weight than carbon dating and stuff are they
saying that look there there are zodiacs there are things like astronomical that they're basing
the timeline off of because I mean that stuff though it moves it's kind of fixed if you know what it
means they can they can date using that with pretty good accuracy I suspect whereas carbon dating is
kind of it can be hit or miss is that is that how what is it outweighing the carbon dating concept
like we have supposedly fourth century or third even 12 uh second century fragments supposedly
of New Testament right um I know you probably haven't probed too deep on what the new chronology
dates these these texts so to speak maybe you have maybe you have a just a guesstimation but
what what do we do with carbon dating because I know that's a key factor I'm sure you hear a lot
from people who don't even like take the time to look at this stuff yeah um carbon dating is
interesting it's another one of those things that is they say it's an independent dating method right
um but it's not by my I wouldn't call it independent because it's dependent on mathematics uh to
calculate these dates and it's dependent on historical records to understand how long the
how long the half life is on the carbon so what what happened was with radio carbon dating they
used dates of known objects to calibrate the so yeah this is what they just offer the fixed
chronology so to speak this so yeah they it was I I don't know how many I haven't even been able to
find the fundamental publication on it I imagine it's in a library somewhere but it's not published
online anywhere for people to be able to go in and say okay well what did they use to figure out
what the half life was here and um the two main the two main things that are often reported are
that they used bread from Pompeii and a cloth from an Egyptian mummy or some yeah I think it's the
cloth from the Egyptian mummy so but the bread from Pompeii is one of the big ones so they say for
sure you know Pompeii got destroyed in 79 AD and um based on that you can figure out kind of how much
the C C 14 has decayed uh but yeah I haven't dug into the terminology for the carbon stuff I've
looked into kind of how it's set up mathematically and based on the dating system so originally it
was based on that and then with more developments they were able to create a calibrated date but
I have these I have an Instagram I post quotes from stuff that I read I got three really good
ones on radiocarbon dating and one of them talks about how the calibrated dates are considered
to be more accurate but scholarly communities disregard them to keep chronologies consistent
and so regardless of the radiocarbon dating that they do they ignore it anyways to still say yeah
no this is definitely right you know that date was just wrong the the test was off um
so you're you're like me you're a lot like me and in the sense that uh there may be a historical
Jesus but there are certain things that you're going hey guys what why is this question not
that important to you oh no we just based it off this methodology this is why we
presuppose there's a historical Jesus because we know other people have cognitive dissonance
they experience seeing dead people rise from from the dead or they experience dead people
that are recent relatives are close to them which I just recently did a show on the explanation of
how a risen lord could even be the case for Jesus Messiah and then they'd worship him etc and he
became into divine same with Bart Ehrman kind of concepts and and anyway I'm like the question
doesn't matter we already know he existed it's like but no you don't know that with certainty
so dealing with what you're talking about with the chronology I'd like to I'd like to dig deep
and and make sense of this for someone like me who's not able to really wrap my head around it fully
but what does it do to you when you listen to my show and I'll say stuff like okay in 63 ad
or 64 ad when the war with you know when the Jews went and attacked the two legions of Rome and then
in 70 when when the war began and then in 73 do you just kind of like disregard those those things
that are commonly discussed as as if the chronology is correct and you just say hey but we're we're
focusing in on what the literature is saying I'll disregard the chronology right now focus in on
what the literature says and then you reinterpret that later somehow trying to figure out when or
what's your head do because you've got a unique way of looking at things um yeah so I I try to be
familiar with different people's arguments and so now I really have to kind of talk to people and
ask them questions about what they really what they personally believe because from person to person
like I get a whole bunch of different responses you know like I was talking about with the timeline
comparison thing that I did um if I talk to Joe you know he's gonna tell me 4500 years ago this
thing happened and I talked to Jenny she's gonna tell me 3500 years ago it happened and
I'm gonna be left to reconcile between the two of where's this extra thousand years come from um
and your new chronology saying everything's happened within the past thousand years so
what the heck has been going on in that thousand years from 3500 to 4500 that's so yeah when I'm
listening to your show um you guys you talk a lot about the historical Jesus or the mythological
Jesus you know the character Jesus and um the people and events that are related to him and
you know how can we even be sure that there was a Jesus character and stuff like that um a lot of
textual criticism and um historical historicism um so yeah but when I listen to your show I take
all that in and I try to get familiar with what some of the top scholars are saying I mean you I
think you've had Richard Carrier on here haven't you yeah a couple times yeah you've had Carrier
on here you've had I think Atwell uh Dr. Price um you've had some pretty big names in this field
on and so you know listening to what they're saying is definitely worth the time because you
know they're leading names in this study and so um because of that you know you'd hope that they're
bringing the leading information um and I would say they do uh based on what I've seen so based on
that information I I do try to kind of reconcile it with where it would actually fit into the new
chronology and what could these texts actually be talking about and so then you know you guys talk
a lot about comparisons because there is a there's a ton of theories out there about you know who was
the real Jesus um I I don't remember the guy's name I think it's Ellis um he yeah argues that he's
King of Odessa uh I could be getting that wrong but yeah so Jesus is King of Odessa the yeah you
were talking about having Berman on he I think he argues that Jesus was someone else right um
he has actually come to the conclusion that that it's kind of a Frankenstein but that it's
based off of King Bazus the father of the son whereas Ralph Ellis thinks it's actually King
Bazus the the king's son who's actually Jesus but he actually thinks he is Jesus I think Jacob
actually says the gospel narrative that takes place under Pontius Pilate they based him in the 30s
under as King Bazus based it off of him so I dude all of this is speculative by the way it's just
based off things like uh he'll say the names sound very much alike they both had a similar
program an aspect about them etc etc it's all circumstantial but it's trying to make sense of
a big it's chicken shit making a chicken pie you know like the new chronology based on what you
just said you know it it would fall in line that uh Fominca argues that the biblical Jesus Christ
is based upon the the most accurate secular records that we have are the Andronicus Comnenos
and Andrei Bogoliubsky I think is his name and those are the two primary chronicles that we have
of an accurate rendering of what happened to this dude that gave way to all the stories about Christ
and Commodus and Socrates and players like that well those of you watching okay history took
place all within the past thousand years practically okay give or take think about that if we've been
told 2000 years ago is when Jesus came on the scene we we we still got 1500 at least years to start
talking about Egypt to go back that's 3500 years if this new chronology saying it all happened
within the past thousand that's something to look in I mean you can scoff and mock at it but it's
something I think is worth looking at at least challenge it and I like your position Stephen
because at least you're saying hey I'm gonna ride it till it's till I can see you know the holes in
the armor and and and I want to see it fail but under strict scrutiny I want to see scholars come
at this thing and disassemble it and stand firm on the chronology we have right now or make at least
a strong case for why that one's absolutely you know not the case you're like me man under underdog
you know so to speak but but you have your reasons I'm not saying you're just picking it
because it's the underdog position I'm saying you have your reasons I would love to see you be
challenged on it by someone who's educated in this field to at least help you with your search
because I don't have that same ambition right now but then again I haven't actually studied
the theory if I watch the theory and I'm sure some light bulbs might go off and go oh shit how do
you know anything at this point because it's probably going to confuse the hell out of me
trying to figure this stuff out there's a lot of layers you have to factor in and
there's a presupposition but then when you realize that oh but that's based off of another
presupposition and it's just like how do you do it man how do you do it so any any other information
for this first episode that you think is important for someone who's new looking at this that they
should know about this theory I think that's important before we close out because we need to do
I think you'll you'll come up with some stuff for our next podcast in detail that we can particularly
cover that you think is going to be vital but what do you think a newcomer looking at this needs to
know um you know it's it's definitely not something that you're gonna figure out overnight uh you're
not gonna be able to quick hop on Wikipedia or skim through some of the books and then be like
ah ha you know I've cracked the code and now I can show exactly how this guy is wrong um it's
gonna take some time and investment um there's a lot of different areas that it touches on and so
if you're getting into it and you're starting to look at some of the information I think that uh
you're gonna want to have at least a either strong background in mathematics or a strong
background in history uh because the two legs that it basically stands on are the sciences and
humanities and uh you're gonna want to tackle the astronomy or tackle the textual analysis um to
figure out exactly how it's wrong um I've gone in and I've done quite a bit I I have a website
that I post on and um I'm tracking my information and my studies publicly and I invite people to
come in and comment their send me messages about where I have it right or wrong and um to try and
sort this out as quickly as possible because if if it is all nonsense you know I don't want to be
wasting my time on it for too long um but if it actually does have some merit to it then um I I'm in
the understanding how to figure it out so yeah for new for new people coming in uh I I would just
recommend um not knocking it based off of a night's research or even a week's research you know I've
been looking into this for a few years and I still have quite a bit to learn um to be even able to
uh explain it to other people exactly how it's been uh constructed this is a project that's
been over 40 years in the making so to try and condense all that and comprehend it in under
two or three years you know it's it's definitely a lot of work to be looking through um but yeah
and you have to know a lot of stuff about history too so uh definitely uh check out I don't know
can I say my website name absolutely I'm gonna put it down in the description of the video so not
only you say it here please um I'll make sure that they can go and click the link down in the
description it's the first link you see in the description is his website all right so yeah it's
www.ctruth.today um and that's c truth is in the letter c and then truth it used to be chronology
truth but that's a lot to type and um I was meeting quite a few people that couldn't pronounce the
word or um they didn't know what it was so c truth is a lot more uh calm and collected uh
c truth today you know it's about trying to understand exactly how we arrived at the modern
ideas of um history and so really you know like if you if you believe that we're in 2019 then the
question is why do I believe that and um sort of pulling those types of threads and so then if you
were to say you know I believe it because Christ was there then you say why do you believe Christ
was there and so on and so forth and what it boils down to typically is the textual history and
that you learned it either from it's all based on the texts um so yeah and then figuring out what
those texts are and tracing them through history so technically our our timeline of being in 2020
right now is fabricated if this new chronology is correct we're not in the year 2020 but okay
it would be incorrect to suspect Jesus took place 2020 years ago you see what I'm saying like
he wasn't born 2020 years a give or take you know a go based off of this new chronology
we're in the year at least what eight eight six seven okay um it's actually yeah it's kind of funny
when you just say it like that uh I have gotten to this point where I kind of like I know who Jesus
Christ is based on the traditional viewpoint and so like yeah Jesus Christ did live 2000 years ago
in that story in that fictional myth um yeah for sure he definitely did but in reality no he
just got created in like the 14th or 15th century um when the stories were edited and finally written
down I got one last question I gotta I gotta ask what is gonna happen with everything you've
studied these years if you end up getting someone who can show you the like hey this
chronology is correct or they give you enough sufficient evidence to say okay okay uh I'm going
to stand with the basically the standard chronology it's right and wrong there's some things that may
not be completely correct but let's suppose someone and I I know you hope this happens at
least if not someone comes on and goes hey voila good point this is something that needs to be
investigated but what would happen if someone actually comes and convinces you that all that
information you spent with this chronology based off of from Yinka what would you what what do you
think man I mean yeah I didn't even mention this but um it was like I must have been like 19 or 20
I came up with this idea called think well um I stumbled across this article it had like 250
cognitive biases and fallacies on it and I decided to every day practice on um identifying these
fallacies and biases and I'm trying to identify them in my own life too to see how in which ways
am I thinking poorly and so uh to think well is to understand all these different identified
errors in our thinking and reasoning and um the the new chronology I also saw that as a great
opportunity to practice the think well um thing so at the end of the day you know I'm gonna be
thinking well and uh trying to still improve my thinking on that and really taking a critical
view on it all um while I'm going through it I'm learning a lot about traditional history anyways
and so at the end of the day if it's all wrong I'm already gonna know a little bit more than the
average person on why they believe what they believe on certain things um I know when certain
things come to light uh over the years you know I've watched I've consumed a lot of content
historical content and I know kind of where the different areas are that still can be um
sort of built upon um where the dark areas are that we could easily shine a flashlight on too to
see what's there um concerning the idea of somebody convincing me that it's not true uh I think the
easiest way for you to do that would be to just get all your information get your ducks in the
line about uh the statistical analysis for the narrative materials and explain exactly how it's
wrong or get your ducks in the line for the astronomical material and explain exactly how
those calculations are wrong um I'd be really interested in seeing um people's information on
that uh it's taken me quite a bit just to get familiar with what the arguments are much less
to calculate them and verify them all so I've only verified maybe a little a small portion of it all
but I chip away at it daily here and there so um yeah come at you just get the uh information about
the historical analysis or the astronomical analysis and um make sure it's really comprehensive
because I I'm um it'd be I'm really looking into theoretical areas here so it'd be theoretical
astronomy and theoretical history and so it's based off of what we can definitely tell for sure um
you'd want to if it the way that I would structure the arguments would be if the speeds of these
planets are constant and so and so you know these are the all the different dates that they could be
in and um then you know if the earth's rotation does change if it slows down at certain points
um this is where all the planets would be and um that's one thing that uh that's why I'm brushing
up on my trigonometry skills is because all the apps out there are based on NASA and the
um European Space Agency and they're all based on the given that the earth's rotation does change
and so it's hard to verify with their information because their information is tainted in a sense by
the um the assumption that yeah the earth changes rotation and we know this because of the historical
records oh wow okay once again another presupposition to making your point but then again I'm not
I'm not educated to make that type of pro or con against it and I like where you're at with this
so technically someone come on someone someone bring it and and someone who understands this more
um Steven's asking for someone to you know not come and attack but man come and help him out
if you've already traversed this path even if it's attack I don't care you're at the point you
know I yell at me please if it has if it's valid information I don't really care how you present
it um as long as it's valid and comprehensive uh otherwise you know if you present it politely
you know I'll probably think of you in a different light than if you were to obviously be abrasive
about it um but yeah so really it's it's just going to take uh math it's you know I I didn't
really uh going into this I didn't realize how much math was involved in history uh history itself
is dependent on applied mathematics uh basic fundamentally it's dependent on applied mathematics
and it's because history is based on chronology and chronology is based on applied mathematics
and so without applied mathematics all you have is a half full of facts that could be splattered
anywhere um so without math and fun a really comprehensive understanding of that um I just
think that it's uh possible for a person to be able to argue against this so that's I've been
spending a lot of time on math and my I was doing math just for fun the other morning and my girlfriend
was laughing because you know she's like I would never do this for fun right I gotta say good luck
because I hope someone comes on that's that's interested in these things and at least hopefully
someone's traversed this path before but I will speak on your character here for a second that
you've always been kind you've always been open minded it appears to me you're you're interested
in hearing no matter what side it is no matter where it's coming from if it sounds interesting
you're willing to hear it out um and so I'm gonna ask my audience if you know someone please let's
get this out there put it out there share it with someone that you know who who's the astrophysicist
do you know who's who's someone that might have a level of brilliance that can understand these
things and get this information to them let them check it out please I'm asking you because I would
like to have you find that you know what you need and say why is everything based off this I think
I probably already know the person that's gonna convince me if I'm gonna be convinced and it's
gonna be me because there's just nobody that's really looking into this so I think that probably
before any expert gets their hands on it I'll have already become a established expert on the topic
and either I'll be even more for it or more against it but what do you think what it's a flip a coin
of course do you think at the end of the day both of them might be wrong do you think at the end of
the day you're like okay we got it wrong the traditional view is wrong but this new chronology
is also wrong yeah I could see that there's just there is a lot in the new chronology um
that would make me suspect that if anything this new chronology is way more accurate than the other
one wow there's that that just boggles me to say there's this one there's this one thing that
this is a really strong point and I've this I've only had one or two rebuttals to it and basically
it's either that it's okay so yeah I'll just explain this to you real quick okay there's a map
that was uh produced not by their team but by somebody that they had found their something I
can't remember the guy's name but basically what he found was that the capitals of um Europe so I think
you know all of all those capitals are based on major cities from the past um
all of these capitals are based on the major cities and they span out in concentric circles
from Vladimir Russia and this is in the new chronology evidence of a quick expansion
and a attempt at structuring the empire and that the cities are similar distances apart
and similar distances out from the center and they span out in concentric circles and
it just it boggles my mind I've gone and I've looked at it on you know there's like a ton of
different ways to render a map um the mercator projection is really popular uh I've looked on
a few different maps and really there's no other I've done so you can the main argument that I hear
back on this is that you could just do circles out from any point and it'll line up like that and
that's not the case I mean you can try it for yourself I'll try and remember to send you the link
but if you put circles out from just any given point it does not line up like it does from Vladimir
these these cities are based structured out from that city it appears and so the main argument
that I hear that it's just you could do it from any point is nonsense the those people have not
tried to do it so technically they're saying from from a certain location you're with this theory
saying from that Vladimir location um technically these circles work out where these cities or
civilization or people groups are in perfect locations equally distant on their way out
I've heard something not like this but and I'm not trying to be funny when I say this like
there was a guy trying to explain why there's certain structures that line up across the
earth almost like it's a satellite view like who's watching us from above you know down below
how did they see and know to line these particular huge megalithic structures in particular areas
across the earth they did it almost looking like they saw it from space in a way knowing that that
would look like the Nazca lines right so it kind of makes me wonder where you're going with this
it's not like this can just work at any point you got to have to see it from a certain angle
is that kind of in a way a rough way of saying what you're saying from Vladimir this only works
it's not something that you'd have to see from space but right I'm just saying that
basically like it's mathematically it's really it'd be a really tough I mean it'd be really tough
than not for it to just be a coincidence you know statistically it's a really small chance that
the cities would line up like that just by coincidence and that's all it is is and maybe it
is you know maybe Vladimir really was one of the latest cities to be developed and turned
into an important city but yeah in the new chronology there's five major points for this empire
that it comes from and this is like summing up all of human history in 30 seconds that we started
out in Egypt developed sciences and technologies we moved up to Constantinople near Bacos mountain
and from there we went to Vladimir which was the third capital then we moved back down towards
Istanbul and finally up into Moscow before the collapse of the empire and this is why the
this is why Moscow is sometimes called the third Rome is because in the traditional history some
people would count the Rome in Italy as the first one Istanbul is the second one and Moscow is the
third but in the new chronology Egypt is identified as the first the capital outside of Bacos mountain
is identified as the second which is where Christ is born outside of and then Vladimir is identified
as the third and then the fourth one moves back down to it's when Christianity becomes declared
as the state religion the common people defeat the royals in a battle and so they move it back to
commemorate their savior this is the uh oh yeah 323 I can't remember the date off the top my head
but uh that's what that is about in the traditional history is the I think Constantine
ushers it in but so yeah in the new chronology it's uh in the I think 1390 is when the fight is
so 14th century is when they're back down in there but yeah it's interesting stuff very interesting
and different uh never really dug into this kind of stuff before Steven so I really appreciate
you bringing this on we've got to do more what I would ask of you on our next podcast if possible
not only put some material together that you want to share but try and think of a way of sharing it
which is very complicated to do where someone dumb like me can chew on it and get it I grabbed
what you said but uh I I definitely it's very complicated I'm not convinced is what I'm trying
to get at like I mean I'm not saying that it's not a possibility I don't know I want you to try and
like convince me so to speak like try to but I can do that it would take research of course
on my end to really buy into anything but like um pretend uh you know you're able to try and tell me
facts and base it off of those and and make a case for what you're what you're saying so
would that be something you think we'll dive into something specific on the next show we'll have a
really specific topic that we can zoom into we could even do Josephus if you wanted to
whatever you want yeah yeah I can pick something up I I did start putting together some stuff on
Josephus just because I was watching your show and he's one of the main uh sources you know for
extra biblical uh reports on Jesus well you supposedly you know the number one historian
you know or at least uh definitely Jewish historian in the first century and that's
first century but right is it really the first century what is the first century the first
century 900 years ago you see what I mean so yeah the earliest surviving manuscripts that we have
of Josephus I think are dated to the ninth to tenth century and that's just like I think one or two
of the manuscripts the rest of them are all considered to be 14th and 15th century manuscripts so
that's when the traditionalized three considers them to have been created
based on if you really want to get skeptical when those manuscripts themselves surface out of
obscurity is even more recent than when they were created because the traditional view is that they
sit around in a monastery for 100 200 300 years before anybody discovers them and starts to use
them again so I'm starting to trace out some of that uh textual history like that I've got
quite a bit done on the bible which starts to appear out of obscurity in the 15th century
with the codex Vaticanus in 1475 and uh so yeah it's kind of interesting stuff there's
dude this is I like uh centering it around Christianity because obviously this is the
Gregoroman backbone of all this stuff is what we're dealing with but uh I'd like to do whatever
focused and centered around this it's the topic a lot of times I bring on the vision so yeah
let's do it bring it yeah we'll we'll get into it okay well I appreciate you joining me brother
yeah thanks for having me on website is ctruth www.c the letter c truth dot or is it
is it ctruth it's ctruth dot today today okay awesome man um I appreciate you joining me man
here myth vision and like ladies and gentlemen I know this is uh something you've probably never
heard of leave your comments down below you know something to investigate look into it if you're
smart enough to do that kind of stuff uh on this level please help them out and how can they get
a hold of you Steven other than the website or is that the best way to get a hold of you um I've
got all sorts of stuff on the website to get a hold of me I've got uh a ton of social media on my
homepage you know I've got links to basically every social media account I'm on uh my that I've
got a gmail account that's specifically for chronology truth or ctruth so yeah if you just go to the
homepage uh there's a contact bar a contact thing at the top and there's another one at the bottom
and you can comment on just about any web page on the website so I am really easy to reach if
you're trying to get a hold of me I might not see your messages right away but uh if you want to
get a message out there it's really easy to do so sounds good well I appreciate you joining me here
