I was peeing a few weeks ago, and my seven-year-old son walked by, and he's like,
What? Why does your pee look like that coming out from down there?
It just goes everywhere. And he's, and I'm like,
Well, that's just where my pee hole is. And he's like,
Oh, I remember one time he told me that you have three holes down there.
Where are they? So I pull up an anatomy chart as I'm literally on the toilet.
And I have like, there's this animated drawing and I'm like,
Here is the clitoris. And then he's like, Well, what's this?
And I'm like, Oh, that's the labia.
So instead of me, most parents' institutions are like, Oh my God, don't look.
I'm like, don't open the door. Close the door. How dare you see me pee?
It's like, I'm like, Oh, yeah, this is just what it is.
This is what it looks like. And he had questions.
And I think kids are naturally inquisitive, but when we shame them
because we don't, we feel uncomfortable, those questions never get to surface.
And then we temporarily feel comfortable because I'm like, Okay,
I'm not supposed to have bought that.
But then now they had to go find out on their own.
Yeah.
