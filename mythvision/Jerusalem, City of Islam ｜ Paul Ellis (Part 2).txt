Jerusalem, the city of Islam Today, I'm interviewing Paul Ellis.
On the origins of Islam and in the Quran, the constant references to the house of God.
And when we look at the Bible as its connections, we constantly see Jerusalem being the locale.
Why is it that Muslims prayed in that direction but then it changed?
While the Muslim sources say Mecca, while others are arguing Petra as the source for
Mohammed's journeys in the beginning, Jerusalem is the only place we have a coin.
We have numismatic evidence supporting the case that early Islam started and was birthed
from the city of Jerusalem.
In this 25 part series with Paul Ellis, we're going to go through these arguments.
In the case of Jerusalem playing a much more significant role in early Islam than what
the Islamic tradition tells you.
I only want to saffa and mawa and this one's slightly more involved so if I go at a pace
it's because I want to finish this before sunset.
The key verse here is Surah 2, verse 158 Truly saffa and mawa are among the rituals of God.
So whoever performs the Hajj to the house or makes the Umrah, there is no blame on him
going to and fro between them and whoever volunteers good truly God is thankful knowing.
So this refers to people making the Hajj to the house potentially going between two places
one called saffa and one called mawa.
Where are these places?
The Islamic tradition has two rocky knolls just a few yards from the Kaaba where it is
said that Haigarh ran back and forth seven times looking for water.
There's no trace of this prior to the Quran.
This tradition or these rocks having any particular significance and I would say that that's an
invention whoever established the Meccan shrine looked around for a way of incorporating
saffa and mawa found these two rather convenient small hills and says yeah that one's saffa
that one's mawa.
Okay look what do they really mean?
Mawa I would say is Mount Moriah I think they're so similar as words that that's a reasonable
inference and Mount Moriah is so crucial to the story that the Quran constantly tells
the Bible story that I think it has to be a very good candidate.
Remember Mount Moriah was a scene where God tested Abraham with the sacrifice of Isaac
in Genesis chapter 22 a story that as we've seen is referred to in the Quran in Surah
2 verse 124, 129.
It is also in biblical tradition precisely on that spot where Abraham raised the knife
to sacrifice his son and that Solomon later built the situated the holy of holies of the
Jerusalem temple and that's in two chronicles chapter 3 verse 1.
So that's Mount Moriah I find that a very easy a very easy step to to interpret saffa
a little bit more challenging.
I would claim this as a reference to a hill that's called Ha Hatsofim or in the more common
it's now more if you look at an English language map of Jerusalem it's now called Mount Scopus
which is a Greek word coming from the fact that it was originally called the the Mount of the
Watchmen or look out look out mountain and if they don't sound particularly like saffa
this hill was referred to as saffa by the the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.
I can't help but but no you can go to the next image if you'd like this is really interesting
though I can't help but think that this can't be one person thinking this through so when we talk
about the Quran this is why I'm interested in getting that book by Daniel Beck it's quite
expensive I looked it up on Amazon but the idea that that the Quran is like one guy wrote all
this down and is aware of all these sources this detailed if it is one guy he knows how to read
and write I can't imagine or his staff that is around him are brilliant and they know where
this stuff is at I cannot picture an illiterate man who does not know anything from anything
never escaped Arabia coming up with this stuff this is just that's why they want to say it's an
angel Gabriel but that just to me is I would refer to the the authorship of the Quran as genius
I regard as one of the most impressive literary achievements of humankind for somebody
to write the first book in a language and to pack it in with this level of sophistication
of of literary references textual references and wordplay and puns and ingenious little twists and
the great injustice is that Muslims or the Islamic Islamic tradition gives these banal
and simplistic answers at every opportunity where is Safa and Marwa oh it's two hills one
called Safa and Marwa and somebody used to run between the two my favorite one is the blind man
so 80 where the blind man frowned and turned no he frowned and turned away when the blind
man came to him and the the explanation is that the prophets were within the mosque one day and
a blind man came to him and Muhammad frowned and turned away and this level of utterly banal
and simplistic explanation for such a sophisticated book is really an injustice to to the author
and what what he originally meant yeah and it makes me wonder if it's one author and then there's
the poetic sense of the text but I I wonder if it's multiple like some academics think that this is a
this is a like a a work like by multiple people in it I don't know it's just if not I just I
don't think that like you said the simplistic dumbing down of the reality of the text is just
it really is stilling the thunder of the text because I told this to Muslims and they talked
about Angel Gabriel gave all this and and I'm like I'm finding Gnostic I mean stuff that's in
Alexandria Egypt which is not too far from Arabia okay and I'm thinking to myself where are they
coming up with these ideas of Jesus not being actually crucified and I found precedents that's
already existed within Christian tradition even if it is Gnostic um that he didn't get actually
crucified and I'm thinking well if this is already something that's existing what's more probable a
guy hiding in a cave who gets some type of revelation or he's well aware of all these traditions
or his group are aware however you want to put it that to me is more probable it makes the most
sense and it makes it more fun to me yeah the the bits of Persian in there particularly
relation to Paradise and the images of Paradise and Mithraism there's bits of Ethiopic tradition
in there it's the guy or whoever it was whatever process led to the Quran was fantastically
erudite and the notion that this is an illiterate guy is is it doesn't know justice to the text
it doesn't honor doesn't honor the Quran at all okay so what do I say about what about
Saffa by Josephus is it possible this is just a coincidence well let's have a look at what it is
it's a reference to Jerusalem as the eschatological landscape so here you see modern day Jerusalem
and the Dome of the Rock is built around the natural summit of Mount Moria if you took away that
great rectangular platform that's been built and added on by one person after another and you take
it all away and you would find a mountain underneath which would have its summit exactly where the
gold golden dome is built over it and over way in the distance you can see Mount Scopus or in
Hebrew known as Ha Hasofim well this passage in Josephus refers to Saffa within the context of
the conquest of Jerusalem by Alexander the Great the Jews this is obviously going back
back away you probably know better than I do is that fourth century BC Alexander I believe it is
fourth fifth century let me double check it we'll go ahead keep going okay go along a way back back
in the day the Jews refused to help Alexander according to Josephus's recording of the tradition
the Jews had refused to help Alexander and when his army approached they were afraid
that he was going to sack the city so the high priest called Joshua left the city in a great
procession to ceremonially offer its surrender to Alexander at a place called Saffa it was fourth
century just so we know okay and when he that's Joshua the high priest understood that he meaning
Alexander was not far from the city he went out in procession with the priests and the multitude
of the citizens the procession was venerable and the manner of it different to that of other nations
it reached a place called Saffa which Nafe translated into Greek signifies a prospect
for you have then a prospect both of Jerusalem and of the temple so as you can see here that's
such where it would be you can just about see the temple in the distance from from over there
and when the Phoenicians and the Chaldeans that followed Alexander
thought that they would have liberty to plunder the city and torment the high priest to death
which the king's displeasure that's Alexander's displeasure fairly promised them the very reverse
of it happened and this is where Josephus then goes on to portray Alexander as a righteous pagan
who's very respectful of the Jewish tradition and he actually leaves the temple alone he doesn't
plunder it and honors their Jerusalem and and so on is his part of the incorporation of the figure
of Alexander into the Judeo-Christian tradition now Alexander appears in the Quran twice in Surah 18
verse 60 to 64 we have the story of Moses and the fish this must have puzzled more than most
part of the Quran this must have puzzled Muslims for centuries why on earth is the Quran telling
them this strange story of Moses he stops and his servants about to prepare a fish for them to eat
the fish comes alive leaps out of his hand and swims away what on earth does it mean this is
in fact a variant of a third century Alexander romance of pseudo-cholestines but you didn't
have to go that far this is also referred to in the Babylonian Talmud and also in the homilies
of Jacob of Saru which incidentally also contain the story of the seven sleepers of Ephesus which
also inspire a story in Surah 18 at the same time so whoever was reading or whoever was composing
Surah 18 was I think under the influence of Jacob of Saru primarily well the story of Moses and the
fish the original story is that Alexander is traveling the world seeking the form to eternal
youth and his servant Andreas wants to wash his fish in a river and the fish leaps becomes alive
and swims away as in the Quran story and Andreas trips and his attempt to recapture his dinner
falls into the water never never tells Alexander about this this incident until sometime later
and then he recounts this odd story and Alexander realizes that that was the font of
uh immortality where they had camped and they go back looking for it and they can never find it
again and it's a Chris it's a Christian allegory because the idea is that the great ruler Alexander
the Great misses out on salvation whereas the humble servant there's obviously a metaphor of
baptism there and the humble servant gets immortality and his master doesn't
if I may just to make a funny interesting connection to the Gilgamesh epic this is kind
of another modern retelling of what happened with Gilgamesh where he goes to Utnapishtion
trying to seek immortality he gets a plant or he's told to take this plant in the plant gets
stole or taken by a serpent and the serpent takes off with this plant and he cannot live forever
which in the ancient world when the serpents would pill their skin they would renew their life
and they thought they lived forever just an ancient Near Eastern concept of snakes but
that's just it makes me think of that much older how these retellings are taking place but the fish
we know that's Christ we know that's Jesus yep so the Quran knows this fish is clearly
assembled for for Christ but if you don't understand this just think of all those
countless generations of Muslims reading this story and just scratching their heads saying
what's this about it's we're so privileged now to have all of the internet and access
to all this information but the Quran is so rich and this and it really doesn't injustice to it
not to to spot the the illusions that his author clearly intends his readers to get
thank you then a few verses later we have the story of Dil Karnayn the two horns one
and this is a variant of a different legend of Alexander the Great this time it's the Syriac
legend of Alexander and this is more relevant more important because this is used by Heraclius
to celebrate his victory over the Sasanian Empire in 628 in the Syriac legend Alexander goes to the
place of the rising of the sun and the place of the setting of the sun and then he goes to another
place where he builds a wall of iron and bronze to keep Gog and Magog at bay and he says that when
Gog and Magog break out then that will be a sign that the end of the world is at hand well Heraclius
said that yes well I am that that's what's happened he says the Sasanian Empire of Gog and Magog
and the prophecy has come to pass and the end of the world is now at hand and he says I am now
the last emperor before the last day says the time is running out and and I'm the last virtuous
emperor and it's a very very complicated story you you need to read Stephen Shoemaker's the
apocalypse of empire to where he explains all about the role of the last emperor and how the
last emperor fits into to this story but there's there's no doubt that the the story of Dull Carnane
in the Quran is a retelling of the Syriac legend of Alexander the Great and one can only assume
that Muhammad is placing himself in the role of of the last emperor or trying to allude to the idea
that that he is the the main person who's going to establish a righteous rule before the end of of
days I must I must add too that just saying in light of all of this many Muslims early on
actually for I think the first few centuries were all unanimous and agreeing this was Alexander the
Great Dull Carnane was Alexander the Great then things started to change over apologetics I think
start to set in and they start finding ways well this is a problem with our modern conceptions but
actually I wouldn't go that far because the to me that this rather mysterious name the
two horned one seems to me deliberately ambiguous I think that what he's trying to do is trying to
conflate the story or the figure of Alexander with Moses because as Moses has fulfilled the
role of Alexander in verses 60 to 64 with the story of the fish and because Moses was often
depicted as having two horns I think the rays of two horned one is an attempt to take the Alexander
legend and project it onto a Moses like figure and then the Quran author himself explicitly
describes himself as being a new Moses for the new for the new age very interesting that is a very
clever way of putting it yeah there are layers and layers of this and further layers if you want
another layer is the Quran has many similarities with the book of Daniel in particular and and
Bog of Daniel refers to Alexander the Great who he depicts as a goat so it's a complex complex
multi-layered illusion I think thank you okay so now I hope I've explained why what seems of the
first glance to be a rather bizarre reference to Josephus and the accounts of the surrender of
Jerusalem to Alexander the Great if you have a vision of the Quran author or the Quranic community
as being trying to capture Jerusalem that is the place that they're heading towards that's
where it's all about and the course of place where they did actually capture in 638 then this
reference to the surrender of Jerusalem to Alexander makes perfect sense and if one assumes I
think we must assume that the Quran author is very familiar with with Hebrew texts and with
the not actually Hebrew texts it would be a Greek text but the works of Josephus then I think the
reference to Saffa becomes a lot clearer than in my first glance seen so the name Saffa I would say
refers to the surrender of Jerusalem to Alexander the Great who is the Del Canane of
Surah 18 83 to 103 but there's more there's a lot more let's go back to my little
chart of Jerusalem as an eschatological landscape you see over here this area of high ground is the
Mount of Olives and the valley that separates Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives is the Kidron
Valley well in biblical tradition the Messiah will when he arrives will arrive on the Mount of
Olives and the Kidron Valley will be the scene of the judgment of the enemies of Israel if I refer
to two biblical texts the first is the book of Joel chapter 3 verse 2
God through through the prophet Joel says I will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley
of Jehoshaphat that's the the valley of God's judgment there I will put them on trial for what
they did to my inheritance my people Israel because they scattered my people among the nations
and divided up my land so Joel has the the situation of the judgment of the nations of the
world in a valley that he refers to as the valley of God's judgment the valley of Jehoshaphat
now tradition has it that that is the Kidron Valley but we don't need any other any extra biblical
tradition because it's in the Bible itself the book of Zachariah the prophet Zachariah
chapter 14 says low a day shall come for the Lord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst
and I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle the city shall be taken houses plundered
women's ravaged and half of the city shall go into exile the rest of the people shall not be removed
from the city then the Lord will go out to fight against those nations as he fights in the day of
battle on that day his feet will stand on the mount of olives east of Jerusalem and the mount of
olives will be split in two from east to west forming a great valley with half of the mountains
moving to the north and half to the south and the valley of the Lord's mountain shall be filled up
with the valley of those two mountains reach the set it should be filled up as it was filled up by
the earthquake in the days of Uzziah the king of Judah then the Lord my God will come and all the
holy ones with him so Zachariah is absolutely explicit that God's feet will stand upon the
mount of olives east of Jerusalem and he will then form a great valley and because this uses the same
terminology as as Joel it talks about gathering all the nations together for judgment
I think it's reasonable to say that this is the valley of Jehoshaphat which is of course what
biblical tradition says now how does the Quran deal with this the Quran refers to a great plane
in Sura 18 again back to Sura 18 47 to 48 on the day we will set the mountains in motion
and you will see the earth an open plane and we will gather them and leave not one of them behind
he's talking about gathering the nations of the earth together for judgment at what the Quran
refers to as the the valley or the plane of Qiyamah and Sura 20 verses 102 the day the trumpet shall
be blown and we shall gather the guilty on the day blind they ask thee about the mountains
say my Lord shall scatter them as ashes and he will leave it a barren plane you will see no
crookedness or curvature therein so these two passages refer to the God creating a a plane on
the day of judgment for the day of judgment to to take place to assemble all those who are about to
be judged and this seems to me a clear adoption of the passages from Joel and Zechariah the creation
of a plane of judgment and if it adopts the the mechanism of flattening mountains or scattering
mountains like ashes and creating a great plane of judgment then I think you have to accept the
location of that and that would be the the Kidron Valley would be the place where that happened
so the Kidron Valley which is the valley of Jehoshaphat in Judeo-Christian tradition
is also I would say the site of the future plane of Qiyamah on the last day of the Quran
but there's more even than that
to the south we have the valley of Hinnom the valley of Gehenna now I think I've already spoiled the
surprise on this because Jesus refers 11 times to the valley of Gehenna as symbolic of the destruction
of the unrighteous usually by fire so I've got all the references here particularly I would single
out Matthew chapter 12 verse 28 when Jesus says fear not them which kill the body but are not able
to kill the soul but fear him who is able to destroy both body and soul in Gehenna or similarly in
Mark 943 if your hand causes you to stumble cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed
than with two hands to go to Gehenna where the fire never goes out
and as I think I mentioned right at the beginning of our interview
the word jahanam is used in the Quran to refer to hell and the hellfire in fact it occurs 77 times
in the Quran in fact more than that there's another another 30 times when it used as a word
jahim which is probably a shortened form of it but at least 77 times and I think it is clear that
jahanam is an arabicization of Gehenna which is an aramaic version of the valley of Hinnom
so the Quran seems to accept the Jerusalem eschatological landscape you have the valley
of judgment in the valley of Kidron and you have the the the gateway to hell on the adjacent valley
the valley of Hinnom or the valley of jahanam just a small little note about this that I find
fascinating not only does Jesus mention Gehenna which is I like the way you're pointing out this
is what the Quran's discussing he also talks about the judgment of the nations so referring
back to that previous point it isn't just the Hebrew Bible that has this Jesus himself and
Matthew mentioned something about the judgment of the nations he doesn't give all of the geographical
location that you see in Zechariah and what you mentioned in Joel but it I mean when he's sitting
on the Mount of Olives in Mark 13 Matthew 24 Luke 21 and he's saying you see all these things see
this temple yeah this is going down and I think it's very apocalyptic so you know I think they're
harping on the same apocalyptic tone that you find within the biblical text yeah I'll move on to that
but we've got another couple of steps to go
yes there's a ritual of the red cow numbers chapter 19 Moses is instructed to sacrifice
a red hypha that is free from every blemish and upon which no yoke has ever been laid
and Moses is instructed that this this red cow should be led outside the camp and slaughtered
in the presence of the high priest
there's a certain complexity about why this is which doesn't I don't think we need to go
into the details here but there is a part of a wider part of a wider ritual
now in the Mishnah power which is a commentary on on the on the Torah
there is a passage in the Mishnah power one might add is actually called the the Mishnah
of the cow apparently power means cow and in Surah 3 verse not Surah 3 in chapter 3 verse 6
it describes the ritual as it used to be practiced in the days of the of the temple
it says they put them within the Israelites the Jews they made and there's a word that could
be translated as a ramp a bridge or a causeway from the temple mount to the mount of olives
being constructed of arches above arches each arch placed directly above each foundation
as a protection against a grave in the depths below whereby the priest who was to burn the cow
the cow itself and all who aided in the preparation went forth to the mount of olives
so they built this this viaduct over the valley linking the temple directly with the mount of
olives so that you wouldn't step on any graves and you'd walk in this exalted path this pavement
in the sky from one place to the other in order to carry out the ritual of the red cow and there
I've got a a picture again I've downloaded from the internet of of of this ritual taking place
I should add that there is not a slightest shred of evidence to say that this structure ever existed
but that doesn't really that doesn't really affect my argument it's the point that in
in the Jewish tradition this structure is said to have existed right or the way this route
yeah and you've got to ask yourself well where else is this tradition mentioned uh we have it
here in the Mishnah so if the Quran is bringing it up which I think you're going to get there
one plus one equals two anyway yeah so and this is a ritual that is actually recalled in
Surah two of the Quran between verses 67 and 71 you may you may recall I set out Surah two it begins
with the experience of mankind and then moves on to a section of of the infidelity the perfidiousness
of the Jews and and this during the course of this it refers to the Jews being deliberately
obstructive uh concerning the sacrifice of the red cow trying to find any reason any excuse
not to be able to conduct the sacrifice asking um physicians questions about what type of cow it
should be and the second step is the eastern gate to the temple complex is in the book of Ezekiel
said to be reserved for a figure which we assume is some sort of messianic figure that is described
as the prince in Ezekiel chapter 19 he and we assume it's an angel brought me this is Ezekiel
talking back to the outer gate of the sanctuary facing the east but it was closed he that's the
angel said to me this gate is to remain closed it is not to be open for anyone to enter by it
since the lord the god of israel has entered by it it shall remain closed only the prince
may sit down in it to eat his meal in the presence of the lord he was entered by way of the vestibule
of the gate and leave by the same way so we have the eastern gate uh of the temple mount which is
reserved specifically for the messiah and there is a very grand um gateway uh that was built
constructed uh on the eastern side called the golden gate uh which is now all bricked up and
can't use although i think um i think the wakf have tried to reopen this as a mosque haven't they
and as you were referring to yourself uh christianity of the gospel writers not christianity
then really but the gospel writers have adopted this idea of the messiah entering
jerusalem from the east so jesus acquires a donkey to enter jerusalem on palm sunday at a place called
beth age on the mount of olives and he spends his hours before his arrest in the garden of gift
seminary and both of these are on the mount of olives and i would say that this is a suggestion
that jesus entered the temple from the east on those two occasions
at the end of the gospel story jesus ascends to heaven from the mount of olives and the angels
tell the apostles present at the scene uh that he will return to them just as you saw him go up
which is traditionally understood that jesus will return to the mount of olives he ascends from the
mount of olives and he will return to earth from the same place so by completing the the prophecy
of ezekiel so you have this this um eschatological importance of the of the um of the mount of olives
and the the idea of particularly of traveling between the mount of olives and the uh and the
jerusalem temple and the temple mount and the jerusalem proper
so i've built a little uh i've built a little viaduct there for my for my kid on valley
and i've also got jesus on his donkey uh heading across the kidron valley
uh there so is it possible that this is a coincidence
façades façades two's verse 248 saffa and mawa not to be jerusalem it requires the following
fact to be explained away as a coincidence the jerusalem includes two places one of which sounds
remarkably similar to mawa the other once known as saffa
but these two place names they aren't just two individual place names one called saffa and
one called mawa but they are similar geographical features they are both hills and they are virtually
adjacent to one another and i wonder could you find a place called saffa and a place called mawa
in london or paris or new york or any other city um it's quite a remarkable coincidence to find
two places saffa and a mawa but to find them as similar features next to each other i think is
is a heck of a coincidence the jerusalem just happens to be the central location of the bible
narrative associated with many of the karan's key biblical figures and stories as i have mentioned
so it's not just anywhere it's not london or paris or new york it's jerusalem the place that the
karan uh talks about and that all the people that it talks about would regard as a center
that each of these sites has an independent significant significance to passages of the
karan maria as the traditional location of the testing of abraham and the site of the temple
saffa as a place where place where jerusalem was surrendered to alexander the great
more than that it's not just that we've got a saffa and we've got a mawa we've also got the
idea that moving between the two which is what the karan verse refers to he doesn't refer to saffa
and mawa alone it talks about moving between the two moving between the two involves crossing the
kidron valley where the biblical tradition states that the great plane of judgment which is referred
to in the karan will be created on the last day and that this will be following the route taken
by the high priest to carry the sacrifice of the red cow a ritual that is referred to in the karan
in a sura called the cow and the route that ezekiel had foretold that the messiah would take
and which the gospels imply that jesus took one has to accept that all of this is just a series of
bizarre coincidences and in fact saffa and mawa refers to two completely non-descript
walks deep in the hijaz that if they weren't brought into service to explain this verse
would probably never have been given any name at all quick question i'd like to ask you is
when did that tradition of the rocks down there in the hijaz actually be you know
pointed to and when is the earliest we can say that they made those claims
it's a good question
it's going to go straight up to the audience really uh if it all wants to put a post on
with i'd love a question i'd like is the earliest um secure reference to mecca in hijaz um there are
various occasions where mecca is um but the word mecca is referred to for example in the um
in the uh Byzantine chronicle and the and the various hints that there might be something going
on down there you've got the inscription that talks about the building of the carbor in uh 696
isn't it and you've got um inscriptions between taith and mecca that said yes so people were
going backward and forward but what is the first solid reference to somebody saying right i'm going
off and making my pilgrimage now to mecca it's i'm going to be some time because it's located
down at the hijaz i wonder what the first reference to that is it's certainly not going to be before
the abbasid revolution um i wonder when when the first is yeah and i have i have a problem too
just looking at this little map right here to give you an example me and my buddy umar we're
going through this and so you have the taith over here on the right side i pointed to and
this is a side angle to show you the mountain tops to get to mecca unless there's like a narrow
passageway uh here's another one from the top to kind of give you an idea of these mountain ranges
between both where modern mecca where we would say mecca is and taith which i think would be uh
so just interrupt i can't see what you're showing because i'm sharing my screen oh okay should i stop
sharing no no no we don't want to mess that up i just showing the audience there's a mountain peak
here how do camels get through this uh this is just they'll they'll be able to see this and go
what the heck so there's a lot of questions the point is is we have more questions than answers
and when we are looking at these early estates i'm interested in knowing when's the first time they
said hey these two little mountains down here in arabia are really these uh what we're talking about
with mariah or saffa and marwa so good questions and yeah i know who's going with these names either
i mean if in the story the traditional islamic narrative you've got abraham taking haygard down
into the hijas leaving them at the point uh where the mecca where the carbo now is and
abraham gives them some water and says good luck and he disappears they they went out of water
they obviously haven't moved very far and so they're then going hey guys running backwards and
forwards seven times between these two sites now the obvious point is you know if you run out of
water um what's the point of running backwards and forwards seven times how is that going to
help your situation that is reasonable to check both sides for for water it's reasonable to go
back and double check to make sure you haven't missed anything but seven times it makes no no sense
but but more than that let's suppose as that was the case who then calls these two hills saffa
and marwa what did those names mean who said i'm gonna call it saffa because i'm gonna call this
one marwa because uh i don't see any explanation there yeah doesn't exist two random words um in
the caram great points really good points
so
