Jerusalem, the city of Islam Today, I'm interviewing Paul Ellis.
On the origins of Islam and in the Quran, the constant references to the house of God.
And when we look at the Bible as its connections, we constantly see Jerusalem being the locale.
Why is it that Muslims prayed in that direction but then it changed?
While the Muslim sources say Mecca, while others are arguing Petra as the source for
Muhammad's journeys in the beginning, Jerusalem is the only place we have a coin.
We have numismatic evidence supporting the case that early Islam started and was birthed
from the city of Jerusalem.
In this 25 part series with Paul Ellis, we're going to go through these arguments.
In the case of Jerusalem playing a much more significant role in early Islam than what
the Islamic tradition tells you.
I'm now going to really adopt Stephen Schumaker's brilliant work and looking at the sources
that show that Muhammad was trying to capture Jerusalem.
I start with something that Stephen Schumaker hasn't discussed.
The career of Muhammad based upon the historical sources, the earliest event that occurs in
Muhammad's life or a person with the name Muhammad that we know about, is contained
in Jacob of Edessa's genealogical chart.
Now Jacob of Edessa died in 708 and so we can assume that this is made before 708.
It's very close to the Quranic period and it seems unlikely that Jacob of Edessa would
have made a mistake.
I misspoke there, sorry, Stephen Schumaker does address these genealogical charts and
he says that he thinks Jacob of Edessa must have made a mistake here because the dates
don't really tie up very easily with what we all expect of the Islamic narrative but
I find it very difficult to accept that Jacob of Edessa would have got this wrong.
He was the patriarch of Edessa at a time that it formed part of the Arab conquests.
The events that he's talking about occurred maybe 70 years earlier so that could easily
have been within living memory of some of the old people there.
It seems highly unlikely that he would have made a genealogical chart of who was ruling
the different empires at that time and he would have got the first person wrong and
it seems very unlikely so I want to try and incorporate this within a historical model.
Now on the screen you will see this chart.
It starts off with three columns with their dates in, one, I'm not quite sure what the
significance of the first column is, the second are the years of the reign of Heraclius.
The second is the years of the reign of Kuzro and they are correlated to one another and
you see a little margin note where he talks about Mohammed going down on business to the
land of Palestine and it has a little quote there, I feel I can't quite read it on my
screen at the moment.
Then it talks about Mohammed becoming the first king of the Arabians and ruling for
seven years and after that interjection we now have four columns not three and you see
a fourth column has appeared at the end with numbers one, two, three, four going down to
seven and these are the seven years of Mohammed again put alongside the years of Heraclius
and the years of Kuzro and this comes to an end with number two of the Arabs, Abu Bakr
who reigns for two years.
So when one puts this against because we know the years of Heraclius and we know the years
of Kuzro so we can now work out what the years are, the Mohammed it would seem became the
first king of the Arabians in the period between 621 and 622 since that is the eleventh year
of the reign of Heraclius and this is reign comes to an end between 627 and 628.
That was when the reign of Abu Bakr begins.
Now this doesn't immediately fit with Stephen Shoemaker's thesis that Mohammed is campaigning
in Palestine in the 630s because it would look from here as though his reign has come
to an end he's been succeeded by Abu Bakr and that's it so it doesn't fit with a 630s
campaign.
My way of squaring this circle is to say that I think that Jacob of Edessa is accurate and
I think that his reign came to an end of the Arabians and the Ta'ay in 627, 628 at the
point when Heraclius has been victorious in the war, in the great war with Sasanians
and I think that the Arabs have come to a consensus that they want to invade Persia
and they don't want to invade the territory of the Byzantines since they've been successful.
If you're on the edge of a great war and you're looking for a bit of plunder it makes a lot
more sense to invade the side that lost not the side that won.
So I think that Mohammed, his reign came to an end.
We don't know if it was an amicable or if it was if Abu Bakr or they decided to split
their forces or if it was usurped we can't really tell but I would say that the historical
evidence is that Mohammed had an early period ruling for seven years somewhere in northern
Mesopotamia and that after that he then enters into a little bit of a wilderness period of
his own.
Okay, the next source that we have is the history of Sebus.
This is being written in Armenia and I'm sure your website or your podcast has had this
many times before so these words will be very familiar to anyone exploring this topic.
He talks about 12 tribes of the Jews having gathered at the city of Edessa and then as
Heraclius becomes victorious in the Byzantine-Sesanian war he surrounds Edessa and he forces
the Jews to leave.
So taking the desert road they went to Tashkastan to the sons of Ishmael and summoned them to
their aid and inform them of their blood relationship through the testament of scripture and says
that the Ishmaelites weren't initially persuaded by this but at that time a certain man from
among the sons of Ishmael whose name was Mohammed a merchant as if by God's command appeared
to them as a preacher and the path of truth.
He taught them to recognize the God of Abraham especially because he was learned and informed
in the history of Moses.
So he then forms an alliance between the Ishmaelites and the Israelites, the sons of Israel and
the sons of Ishmael and they all gather in union and this uses this phrase from Erila
as far as Saur which is opposite Egypt and that is a phrase that is borrowed from the
book of Genesis to describe the land of the Ishmaelites and from there they went into
the desert of Paran twelve tribes according to the tribes of the families of their patriarchs
and then he divided them a thousand men into each tribe to lead them into the land of Israel.
So here we have a story of Jews being expelled from the Byzantine Empire from Edessa at the
end of the Byzantine-Titanian war they meet somebody called Mohammed who is an Ishmaelite
and he leads them into an invasion of Palestine and I would say this is entirely consistent
with my thesis that Jacob of Edessa was describing Mohammed as an Arab leader somewhere in Mesopotamia
but at 628 at the end of the war he then forms this army and heads off to invade Palestine
but most of the Arabs don't don't join him.
Oh I'm good I'm good this is I yeah I'm well aware of this and there's so many sources that
kind of indicate that this Jerusalem issue is going to come up and the uniting between
the Saracens and the Jews like what is going on here makes me makes me really interested in what
the origins of Islam was like because you have different people Fred Donner I think it was this
umbrella monotheistic group you have other people with all these different views but it's got a lot
of Jewish implications to it that makes it highly odd to me to think that this was purely a Christian
movement or something out the gate as I don't know if you watched my Peter von Sievers interview
but yes yeah it just there's all sorts of interesting things to think about I think Peter
von Sievers is is fantastic at laying out the Christological controversies and setting the
scene but when he's done that and you're ready to hear his explanation of the Quran I don't I
find his argument falls a bit short because the Quran doesn't really talk about Jesus for the vast
majority of its of its text and places where you would expect Jesus to be if for example
if making a list of prophets you would expect Jesus to be in there it's a lot is in there a lot
and Moses but but not Jesus he just really doesn't get a look in until the source right at the very
end I would say so the idea that it all comes out of the Christological controversy I don't think
so because I think Jesus would have a much stronger role I do like Gabriel Said Reynolds's
observation that the early Quran tells Old Testament stories in New Testament language
which I think is very insightful and explains why it's so easy to be set off course
thank you okay um then we have several sources placing Mohammed in Yathrib on the on the Red Sea
most prominent of course we have the Quran itself saw a 33 verse 13 where a group amongst them said
oh people of Yathrib turn turn back and a group of them sought permission from the prophets saying
our houses are exposed that they were not exposed they wanted not but to flee so it's obviously is
attacking a group within the Quranic movement which were seen as turncoats and cowards but
it refers to them as people of Yathrib so this seems to me good evidence that the Quran was
addressed to a people who who were based in in Yathrib we have the constitution of Medina
which is said to be a a treaty between the believers and the submitters of the Quresh
and Yathrib and Yathrib is also mentioned in a couple of early sources the Kuzhistan Chronicle
and the source that Stephen Shoemaker refers to as a common Syriac source otherwise known as the
Chronicle of Theoth Phyllis so I think there's there's good evidence there's good evidence as
you're going to get that Muhammad had a a base in Yathrib so putting this onto a map
we've got 621 to 626 or there about you've got a kingdom of the Tayyai somewhere in Mesopotamia
probably base where the the Lakhmids had previously had the autonomous zone under the Sasanian Empire
628 with Heraclius' victory the Jews are expelled from Odessa and they go into this place that
Sebeos calls Tashkistan they go into the desert they take the road to the desert and this is
obviously the road to the desert and this is where they find and here they they meet Muhammad
but at about the same time in probably the same year Muhammad his reign comes to an end
according to Jacob of Odessa and he is succeeded by Abu Bakr
Thereafter Muhammad establishes a base at Yathrib and I see here some possible early memory of the
hijra this this idea of going into the wilderness of a being dispossessed of your home of heading
out on this on this noble religious quest I see this fitting in to this to this to this model
and so although it's a bit of a story and it seems rather
action packed as a series of events I think I'm a I'm a synthesis on the historical sources I don't
want to say I choose this source and I reject that source I want to try and find an explanation
that accommodates as much of the historical material as possible and this is this is what
I come up with I see no reason why it couldn't be true interesting okay the next bit is the well
known chronicle of Thomas the presbyter who describes how in 634 there's a battle between
the Romans and the Taiyay of Muhammad in Palestine at 12 miles east of Gaza in which the Taiyay
seem to have been victorious Romans fled and and there was then some massacring and plundering
that could just be a little bit of a Christian exaggeration we don't know but we know that
there's good evidence that Muhammad was leading a group of people in Palestine at that time
634 just east of Gaza and we have the British Library Gospel Fragment which tells a similar
sort of story a similar sort of text it says in January of and we think this is for reasons I
don't completely understand and we think this is 637 and in January the people received assurances
many villages were destroyed through the killing by the Arabs of Muhammad or a missing word by
the something of Muhammad and many people were killed and captives taken from Galilee to Bet
we don't know how that we don't know how that ends I like to think Bethlehem because Bethlehem
features in the in the sermons of Sophronius as a place where the Quran author was probably active
and the third source is a doctriner Yaqibi which doesn't actually name Muhammad but
describes a prophet it's about somebody being killed as a commander of the Byzantine army
was killed by the Saracens and the Jews are all very happy with that and the writer asks somebody
what can you tell me about the prophet who has appeared with the Saracens and he replied his
respondents replied groaning deeply he is false for the prophets do not come armed with a sword
later on so I Abraham inquired and heard from those who had met him that there was no truth to
be found in this so-called prophet only the shedding of the men's blood he said he has the keys of
paradise which can't possibly be true so I think that's fair enough to assume that this is Muhammad
and the Saracens concerned it's the same army that was raiding Gaza in 634 and was up by Galilee in
637 so we've got evidence of Muhammad's Palestine campaign and that's a very brief
rattle through but obviously I'd highly encourage everyone to buy Stephen Shoemaker's death of a
prophet to get it in a lot more detail also sticking with Stephen Shoemaker we have another
article that he wrote an article that he wrote on the church of the catisma now this is a as you see
it's a ruin now but back in the day this was a a major Christian church it was used for Christmas
Day Mass because it was believed to mark the spot where Jesus had been born where Mary in the
photo evangelum of James and never actually makes it to Bethlehem and she stops on the way and she
gives birth in an isolated place on the roads to Bethlehem she doesn't actually get to Bethlehem
and this church was built to mark the the spot and Christmas Day Mass was celebrated here
later on with the canonization of the of the four gospels
Bethlehem becomes the official place where Jesus was born and they have to find a new
explanation for this church and so they make it the site of the miracle of the of the palm tree
where palm tree bows down and offers its dates to Mary and that is apparently during the
during the flight into Egypt so sometime after after the birth of Jesus but this Stephen Shoemaker
points out that in southern 19 of the Koran these two elements are united as though they are part of
the same story Jesus is born and instantly as a newborn baby he commands the tree to bend down
and offer his fruit to Mary and also offers a spring of water to appear at her feet and
Shoemaker argues I think very very persuasively that these two traditions are only ever
coexist in relation to the to this church and the historical accident that it was first of all
the church of the nativity and then became the church of the miracle of the palm and the Koran
seems to combine these two I also notice that in Sophronius's Christmas sermon of 634
he talks about being unable to go to Bethlehem to do Christmas Mass because the godless Saracens as
he calls them are on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem where it's only a six-mile road
and this church is exactly halfway along it so I find that's a very very plausible that the Saracens
were in possession of this church and this informs southern 19 anyone wants to know a little more
detail Shoemaker's article is called Christmas in the Koran the nice title the Koranic account
of Jesus's nativity and Palestinian local tradition if you google that you will find it
thank you so one further piece of evidence putting Muhammad campaigning up outside Jerusalem
and of course we have the the fact that Jerusalem does fall to the Arab conquerors in 638 so
Muhammad's fighters are fighting probably as late as 637 Muhammad seems to die and then 638
Jerusalem falls to the Arabs the Koran authors then writes Sorin 9 which talks about being in
possession of the Masjid al-Haram but this has no basmala because their prophet is dead and they
can't give that the seal of prophetic authority and that would be my explanation
Muhammad's Palestine campaign the Koran is traditionally believed to have been revealed
between 610 and 632 carbon dating has suggested that the early mis manuscripts were created no later
than 645 it is suggested that the Koran's sacred place of frustration the place that the Koran
was exhorting its audience to capture was nowhere other than the sacred place where the historical
sources state that a Muhammad was in fact trying to capture between 634 and 637 and the place that
did fall to the Arabs in 638 namely Jerusalem and I think put like that you really need to have a
busload of faith to think that it's all about the hijaz and somewhere in Arabia and there simply is
not a shred of evidence for it there is a a mountain of evidence against it and seen in this light
I've certainly persuaded myself I hope to persuade your viewers too
yeah this is a very interesting point I brought this up with Stephen Jay Shoemaker
and Robert Hoyland and others just to kind of throw out some sources and get their thoughts and
it is very interesting the least I could say is very interesting thank you in in death of a prophet
under in the apocalyptic empire Shoemaker considers it and as I say he says it certainly
can't be discounted as a possibility and that's all he says just one sentence so his mind is thinking
this he can see the sources Stephen Shoemaker is far more intelligent than I am if I can see
he can see it he doesn't want to say it but I would I would welcome anybody who could
just just find him and ask him to how he would characterize this at the at the moment because
it seems to me that the evidence that he has presented makes a case um compelling
so
