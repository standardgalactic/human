associations
uh... that might prognosti prognosti kate what was going to happen in the battle but
for the for the sake of john mccuse thesis
he asserts that through the punning of mesopotamian constellation writing
we get all the motifs of the story in the new testament jesus walking on water
now john now john the okay the the stars as a form of writing
the civilizations come to recognize that after they had already developed writing
or were the stars considered to do that sort of thing
before actual writing had been introduced to those
societies uh... i would argue it's after writing is invented writing is
invented and suddenly the stars are seen in a new way
right they're they're seen as writing and so
right you know no one really understands the birth of astrology by the way
we don't know when it happened i would argue it happens after
the invention of writing astrology is a product
of the invention of writing uh... it's it's because now
you're categorizing things in a completely
different way you know um oral peoples observe everything in nature and they
they look at all the relationships in nature and that's how
they determine where your watering hole and hole is and when
when the calendar occur you know all the all the cyclical events they're
they're watching everything in nature litter people don't do that anymore
we read symbols on a page in the symbols on the page
you know the early alphabets the the symbols on the page were actually
still objects in nature you had animals that were hieroglyphs and you had
you know it was still related to how they processed information but over time
the the alphabetic characters get disassociated with that and they just
become symbols and now you're reading something on a page that has no
corollary in the natural world this actually
rewires the brain now we are all internalized thinkers because we're
reading things that have no corollary in the outside world
oral thinkers they don't internalize like we do
they you know remember a circle they don't have a word for circle
they call it a plate or a moon they don't have a word for square they call it a
door or a house right so they're very concrete thinkers
and everything they think is attached to something they look at and see
well litter people we don't do that anymore we
we abstract everything because we process our information with abstract
symbols on a page that have no corollaries in nature
so this is just the subtext of how we probably the medium is the message guys
and so the invention of writing reformats the way people look at their
cosmology and so not only do we get the birth of the city
state i would argue that's probably when we get the birth of our first
astrological models now before that they're still using astronomy
and they're still using heaven earth correspondences
but you know by the early second millennium bce there is a deeply
systematized astrological system throughout all the ancient world
and uh and that is a product of that regimented
priestly cast subscribes who are writing and they're saying hey
now we can do this to the sky this is the secret of the gods
and we're going to relay the writing of the gods
we've been doing this for generations anyway but now we we've discovered the
secret we we now understand that this is writing that
can be used to foretell the future for example and so
so that's i think that's how that develops but yeah look you know astrology
ancient astrology guys isn't the modern newspaper
natal astrology you look up your birth chart and it's going to tell you what's
going to happen to you today ancient astrology
his primary purpose was to manage the state
we just don't we've just completely forgotten
that all their intellectual resources was to make the state run as a
copy of the cosmos and so you know you you you did your rituals in
in repetition of cosmic cycles because what you're doing
is you're bringing down the beneficial powers of the eternal
into the material realm and so you are trying to duplicate cosmic patterns in
all your social structures and this just gets a new iteration with the
birth of astrology where they are trying to do all
all their wars their the contracts their treaties
in line with what the stars tell them would be the best time to do it
because they're modeling the earthly order after the heavenly order
the primary purpose of astrology is to manage the state
and that's just something we've we've forgotten
you know i could go off on another tangent
i really want to but i'll just get in trouble with
i'm already in trouble with uh some of the scholars i know what he's talking
about astral theology off with his head
i won't i won't get into how the modern world we've descended back into these
astrological astrology is ontology it defines the
self the state in connection with our ideas of the eternal
so technically no it's not modern science modern science is in ontology
it's you know it's it's there to produce technology
but we keep relapsing into these social
social models that that we attach our our sciences to and and
there is a great argument to make that whatever you think of climate change
the climate change industry is basically the secular way to manage the state
and they use every a weather event to describe their theory and this is very
much how the astrologers used every stellar action to describe their
theory and and we're actually doing the exact same thing
that they did thousands of years ago we've just transposed it
from the sky to the ground and you know i i am a huge environmentalist so let
me just put that out there but uh i i think we have some real problems with
way the the system is being run because it's more
ontology than it is science it makes me very nervous
anyway right right you can you can edit that out if you want
i'm going to talk about the new testament in astral theology
um look so mickey writes this article
and uh i i i just fairly disagree with his methodology and so i wrote a opposing
article my article is called the heavenly shepherd approaches to a
resurrection story and um i basically say this whole
mesopotamian constellation writing that you're using to prove that this is
where they got the motifs in the new testament story i think it is highly
implausible and so i just i i one we don't have any
corollaries that we know of in any of the record
where the these ancient astrologers were doing what
you're saying that they are doing two um you're using this constellation writing
to you know every mesopotamian word had a couple dozen
puns associated with it right and so if you combine a couple
words with uh the makes of puns that could be associated with it you start
getting thousands of possibilities and so using mckews methodology you could
say oh yeah mesopotamian constellation writing uh
was what uh the writers of the star wars script used
to create their story if you could literally make that argument
and so it's just not uh refined enough to
so i just had a huge problem with his methodology but having said that
i did think now he does have an interesting thesis
because there are a lot of similarities between these ancient pagan systems
of a ryan in the sea walk which is associated with a resurrection or new
life and the gospel story of jesus but just because
there's associations doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything it just
means there's associations so i i i wrote in my own article
i just explored that theme to see you know what could we prove what couldn't
we prove and what could we say about it so for the rest of this presentation
i'm just going to talk about um uh
i'm going to talk about you know the contours of my argument in my article
and so here we have the uh scene uh in the gospels of jesus walking on water
it's reported in three gospels matthew mark john there are the references
what's really interesting is that every gospel writer gives a different story
and of course you know i i suppose you would expect that but
it's also really interesting that most modern Protestant Christians anyway
uh we don't we're not very good at looking at the contradictions in the
text what what what tends to happen is believers
just combine all the differences into a meta narrative
and they create a meta gospel right uh matthew remembers this mark remembers
this john remembers this therefore the truth must be all of it and so we'll
just homogenize it all and create this narrative where jesus does all these
things i i don't think that's very smart methodology i think it's
much more enlightening to look at the contradictions as contradictions
and to see what we can learn what what the differences are
and of course you can homogenize them if you want but uh
hey hey john if you need to do chapter and verse i've i've got the scriptures
electronically in front of me so if if you need me to to render to read any of them let me know
all right so you can so you can actually maybe point out the why i'm gonna fly through these
because i just spent so much time talking about can enable and climate change which has
nothing to do with anything so i'm i'm i'm gonna fly through this but uh if uh well i didn't
want i didn't want anybody to miss anything because we didn't deal with the actual text so
it's up to you is however you want to all right well i just wanted to point out that the
differences in these texts in the story of matthew jesus departs to pray uh the disciples are in the
boat a storm comes they call to jesus he walks on water peter briefly walks on the water in the uh
gospel of mark something else happens it's it's a little bit humorous jesus tries to walk by the
floundering disciples what's that about they're they're about to die in a storm and and they see
jesus and he's sneaking on by and they call to him and say hey save us and uh jesus looks over said
okay i'll save you and then in the book of john something else happens he say he walks on water
he saves the disciples but he saves the disciples by transporting their boat instantly to the other
side of the shore no no way to say what that that's a miracle greater than walking on water he just
he just zipped out a tardis out of nowhere and moved the boat instantaneously across the sea
thank you dr who yeah that's right and so um we get these radical differences in the gospels
uh you know they they all have similarities but um so we look at those differences and we see
well you know these might be um different uh narrative threads from different traditions that
they're that they're homogenizing into their their textual constructs so all right so the first
thing uh i did as as a scholar is i went to the library to look up what the biblical scholars have
said about the jesus walking on water narrative and so there's this great book by patrick madden
where he goes through all the modern scholarship or the scholarship of the 20th century anyway
and he divides how biblical scholars have interpreted this uh narrative motif jesus walking
on water into five different categories and i thought i would show these guys because one of the
big criticisms that mainstream biblical scholars have against astral theology is that it's just
too subjective and you know they're right there are a lot of a lot of people say this is astral
theological it relates to this constellation but suddenly everyone's giving a different
interpretation the the the interpretation is so subjective there's no you know rigid uniform
standard by which to interpret the astronomical motif that it becomes very unreliable as a
methodology and so bible scholars just rejected out of hand and you know what there's truth to that
you know these astral theological systems were never literate they were never written down if you
publish you perish and they're always ritualized they they were secret initiations and uh and so
we're not going to get what literate biblical scholars want say that last one more time just
just say that one more time i love that i'm just saying the astral theological models
were not literate they were associated with secret rituals and initiations if you publish
you perish and and therefore to get the kind of literate proof that literate biblical scholars
want they're demining a diamond out of a turnip you just aren't going to get the written proof
uh from these ancient oral rituals structures this is i mean
you know i i'm not going to get into that the bottom line is there is a lot of subjectivity
in astral theological interpretation fine and well look at what the mainstream biblical scholars
have done with just mainstream literate biblical interpretation of this of this of this story
mattin divides biblical interpretation into five different categories he says there's scholars
who believe the account is historical it happened just as the text tells us it happened
you know some of them most of them don't deal with all the differences you know they homogenize
the differences in those accounts and then there's a group of scholars that say well maybe
or maybe not not it's historical we don't know and then there's a group of scholars that say oh no
it's historical but he didn't walk on water he was walking on a sandbar you know there's some
natural event because we can't believe in the supernatural and then there's the scholars who
say oh it's not historical at all in fact it might even descend from foreign sources in the first
half of the 20th century there's a whole group of scholars that compared jesus walking on water to
the buddha narrative who walks on water and helps his disciples and so you know there's a group
scholars that say it descends from pagan origins this was john mccuse thesis and then there's a final
group of scholars that say well the account is a displaced resurrection narrative that's actually
very interesting and i'm going to talk about that in a second but i i list all this because
all right so one of the main arguments against astral theology is it's too subjective now look
at what mainstream bible scholars do with the interpretation of any story in the bible it's
like throwing a dart at a dartboard except the dartboard is any damn well thing you want to believe
i mean it's historical it's not historical maybe it's historical it happened it's miraculous
it's not miraculous it's you know look bible scholarship runs the whole gamut right and so
it's as subjective as anything else you know and that's just good to know i still believe in
scholarly methodology and um and so i i am still going to tackle biblical issues using scholarly
methodology but you know i you know here's another aspect of scholarly methodology that we
should be aware of it cannot address divine it cannot address the supernatural it can't there's
nothing in scholarly methodology that can prove or disprove anybody walking on water and it's just
outside right it's just outside of its purview so um that's a real challenge because if you're a scholar
studying you know the supernatural aspects of religion you've got a real problem because you
know your methodology can't address that so um you know so is is jesus historical and did he
really overcome death you know what there's no scholarly methodology that can tell you
that is a choice you have to make and it's a choice of faith it's a leap of faith that's
that's all you get and so um there's nothing that you're going to find in the archaeological
record that's going to prove it or disprove it and you know this is you know one of the weakness
if you know in the myth this is say uh there's no evidence for a historical jesus well whatever
evidence there is we've got it right what kind of evidence are you going to find that would prove
to you that jesus is historical let's say you found a birth record and it said on this date
you know six bc six ad whatever jesus was born to joseph and mary from nazareth uh and a donkey
and a sheep were by his stable let's say you found you you found that birth record well what scholars
do they would immediately say it's a fraud right i mean we take this we take evidence
and we process it through our own you know our own cultural lenses and our own prejudices if you
if you ever sit in a courtroom you can see two lawyers arguing over the same evidence
from completely different points of view and you quickly learn oh my gosh any evidence can
be argued in almost any way so the the bottom line guys is that scholarly methodology can't address
the divine so there's that so you know and i believe in scholarly methodology but in the
interest of full disclosure i am also a man of faith and i just have to take a leap of faith
to be a man of faith i you know my scholarship isn't going to prove or disprove the things i
want to prove or disprove because i can't so that's that's what we get and the other thing is
i've been around scholars long enough to know that if you were to transport a hundred modern
day scholars back in time and in a TARDIS and you transported them right in front of jesus
right at the moment that he's raising Lazarus from the dead so that they could see this happen for
themselves i'm just telling what human nature would do i'm just telling what human nature would
do what would happen a hundred scholars they see jesus and these actually raising Lazarus from the
dead what would happen well you know 90 percent of scholars a few scholars would probably follow their
knees and say i believe and i'm not even going back to my own time in the TARDIS i'm going to stay here
and become a disciple of jesus a few people would do that a few others would go yeah i do believe
but i'm going to start my own school and charge tuition because you got to make money somehow right
and so they start their own religion right a few scholars would do that i'm telling you the majority
scholars this is what they would do they'd pick up a club and they'd beat poor Lazarus back to death
they'd throw his corpse back into the tomb and they'd turn to jesus and they'd say that never happened
i speak with a little you know a little hyperbole but i'm sorry that you know
that's just sort of the deal we were in our own conceptual universes and so we go to this material
with our own conceptual uh interpretations of what we accept as evidence and not evidence
and look here in front of your screen all the different scholarly interpretations of the jesus
walking on water motif and it's everything you can conceive uh and so john john yes you brought
you brought back memories of grad school you know you you know you know when you i'm just describing
grad school yeah that's that's all you're doing you know when you finally decide after after months
of looking at the literature what's your phd thesis what your dissertation is going to be about
and then you find out that some scholar has already done that study yeah and then you hide it
in a corner of the library hoping that nobody will discover it okay i know what you're talking
about yeah edit that out darryl edit that out that's right right hey hey darryl there's a lot
you got to edit out of tonight so thank you you can add uh i'll let you edit anything you want
put in a picture of a cat somewhere all right uh the the point i'm just making some points that
scholarship is is a reliable methodology but it has its own limitations and so when we're
talking about the divine we're talking about the supernatural we're talking about life after
death overcoming death scholarship has really nothing to say about that and so you just have
to make your own choices so make them and if you are an atheist and that's the choice you make then
hopefully that choice helps you lead a good life and if it does then i'll support your choice
and if you're a believer and you say well i can't prove it but i'm going to believe that
jesus walked on water i don't care good for you if it helps you become a good person
do it right the important thing is we're not killing each other with a rock
because that's our nature and so um you know anyway so there's that well
uh let me just go back what really piqued my interest in reading this scholar's review of all
the scholarly interpretations is this last one madden actually belongs to this camp he believes
that the story of jesus walking on water is a displaced resurrection narrative and he gives
reasons why whoops he believes this and here are essentially his reasons if you look at all the
stories in the gospels about jesus walking on water and you compare that to when jesus first
appears to the disciples this isn't to marry or the women at the tomb but to the disciples
strangely enough jesus appears to the disciples by the sea in john 21 one
i should have wrote it down there the exact greek phrase is it can be interpreted as by the sea
or on the sea and that exact same phrase is used in all the sea walk narratives in all three
gospels but also the similarities are these the disciples are bereft of the lord darkness
followed by the appearance of the lord the appearance of the lord occurs that or right
before dawn a formal greeting including command not to fear the lord difficult i difficulty
recognizing the lord in other words there's these common motifs between the sea walk narrative
and jesus first appearing to the disciples and so madden and a group of scholars say
what we think happened is you had this resurrection narrative but it got split up and and and so now
you get this one scene of jesus walking on the sea saving the disciples but originally it was jesus
walking on the sea saving the disciples over death right and so john john by the way
yes john 21 one talks about him walking upon the greek word is epi right yes epi
upon epi tase talises i think yes yes yes sir so right epi upon the sea so um
so that i think that is a very sophisticated argument that's a scholarly argument
and so i think it but what's really interesting about that argument is uh you know if you listen
to the last podcast did you guys listen to the last podcast you we did together yes i hope so
because you were you oh yeah oh yeah uh in my last podcast i proposed the theory
it's a theory and it's unprovable but i proposed the theory that uh by the second millennium bc e the
flood story was being used as part of an initiation process to overcome death this is why gilgamesh s
utnapish team how do i gain eternal life and this is why utnapish team gives his answer as the
flood story and i went and what's interesting i i i traced this through my book mythos and cosmos
there are numerous traditions in the mythological record which associates the floods with
new birth resurrection in eternal life and the big one is uh you know chapter 175 of the egyptian
book of the dead but we also have the labors of heracles and the story of rama where uh they are
find the secrets of life using a bow and arrow and confronting the flood waters or the sea waters
with it and so we get these multiple motifs that have all the same structure to them well and so
the the idea then is that in the oral age with the oral imprinting press the ritual of overcoming
death was synthesized in your oral imprinting press you associated it with a certain star that
represented rebirth and we can actually track that star it's probably serious maybe canopus i'll
explain why later and then uh you reenacted a myth that you told associated with that star
you know we forget that this is very often during childbirth for example in multiple
different cultures there's a ritual that would be performed as the woman gives birth
and part of that ritual would include a deity that uh is the creation deity and the reason why
they're including the creation deity in the birth ritual is because the the creation the creator
created the earth and so they're analogically using the powers of the creator deity and imposing
that on the birth of a new child so when you perform that ritual the child will be reborn as
a new creation so what they're doing is they're pulling in your creation myth and your creation ritual
and they're transposing it on to the myth and ritual of childbirth right that's what they're doing
i'm arguing they did that with the flood story they they pulled in a deity of the flood a ritual
a narrative of the flood and they transposed it over to the ritual of of life after death gaining
life uh because if you survive the flood you're going to survive the waters of death right so that's
that's the thinking behind it and my argument then goes this eventually turns into baptism this
eventually turns into our our uh uh you know our our liturgy of baptism we get reborn uh as a
new christian or whatever religion you are are out of the waters right and so it's just interesting
that this particular scholarly interpretation says jesus walking on water is associated with
resurrection well it turns out all the pagan deities of resurrection are associated with waters
and not only that they have to cross the waters in no small sense they walk upon the waters right
and so here we have our our our next slide look the ancient resurrection theme are gods are heroes
who are born or reborn from the sea or who must cross the sea to find rebirth well here they are
Dionysus Gilgamesh Sargon Osiris Noah Moses Cyrus Tamuz Karna Oedipus Adonis Heracles Jason
Perseus Ryan Romulus all those people have to cross the waters in order to get rebirth or to
get resurrected um and and literally Orion walks on the waters to get rebirth and um uh resurrected
this is why John McHugh says Orion is the precursor to the Jesus story because it's the
constellation that walks on the waters uh that and where he finds rebirth um but there's a really
another really interesting uh parallel in uh Diodorus's library of history where he talks about
Orpheus Orpheus is leading Jason in the Argonauts to the underworld where their secrets uh where they
find the secrets of life okay so this is our repeated theme and they're crossing a sea they're
Argonites in a boat crossing a sea to find the secrets of life all right so here's here's our mythological
template uh Orpheus leads is the leader he's the guide because he's been initiated into the mysteries
of the cabaroids the um um and i'll talk about that in a second but according to Diodorus uh when
they are in their boat a great storm comes up and the boat of the disciples of Jason is about to
be overcome they're about to be drowned and so what's Orpheus do he prays to Caster and Pollux
and uh the storm is abated and so and then they're able to continue their journey to find the secrets
of life well this is also you know there's a lot of similarities we have a boat of of disciples
being led by Orpheus is a savior figure he's a mystery cult figure of resurrection he's here's your
parallel to Jesus and he saves the boat from being uh overthrown by a storm and of course he
doesn't walk on the waters but you do have to cross the waters to get reborn and uh more interestingly
he prays to Caster and Pollux and this gets us into our astro theology uh with Orion uh so we're
about to go down a rabbit hole guys um i like it because one of the things i have a problem with
with astro theologers is i think they get it all wrong um i you know look astro theology because
it's not mainstream scholarship it's done by a lot of pseudo scholars and so there's so it's really
problematic at best uh but um also astro theologers tend to say hey look so Orpheus does the same thing
as Jesus you know Orpheus doesn't walk on the waters but he does descend through the waters
and he does calm the storm and he does save the disciples in the boat and so you know the Jesus
story therefore is just a mimic of Orpheus and then when they get into astro theology which i'm going
to get into here real quick uh with some graphics they'll say well the stars were in this position
and it's basically just the calendar this is what happened to them and so they told a story
about that and that's what turns into our story of Jesus walking on waters and this is generally
how it's told that all astro theology is just some sort of simple calendar model of the stars
crossing the sky to certain seas and it gets turned into a story that's not what is going on at all
and um i take you back to that John real quick if you don't want me emphasizing that what you're
saying are you suggesting not only does it portray these things but there's levels to this or
there's more to it than just oh well that does tell time i mean you know when these constellations
come this season comes there's more than just the physical aspect of telling time in astro theology
this is esoteric this is in every aspect uh back to the orality concept where it encompasses
everything would you agree with that's where you're headed with it absolutely you hit the nail
on the head we are dealing with a vast metaphysical system root i mean it's a religious system
and even as scholars can't address the divine you know we can't really address what these
astro the ancient astrologers were they were describing the same supernatural processes
of overcoming death but using different metaphors but it belonged to a very sophisticated metaphysics
that only the surface was about calendric models of how the stars moved across the sky in the seasons
and that's where all the astro theologers stop and they say oh all your sacred stories it's just
based off this no actually what they're basing it off is the same sacred story with the same deep
metaphysics just using a different metaphor and so you've just short changed your argument
you astro theologers because you haven't answered the issue at all so i'm going to get into this
and so let me just get into it um so i'm just uh giving showing you a graphic here this is
what i wrote in my response to mccue i said look rather than dealing with this
improvable mesopotamian constellation writing which i think is deeply flawed
why don't we just do this if a ryan is the uh you know i i suppose it's important to note
that the story of a ryan he gets stung on the foot by a scorpion he dies uh in another version
he's blinded he rapes the daughter of a king and he's blinded and punished and he's exiled
in both stories he has to cross the sea he regains his sight in one of the traditions at the house
of the sun where uh he is reborn and then he's cast as a constellation in the sky that's sort of
the mythological story of a ryan uh what we get are the motifs there then is the image of death
being stung by a scorpion there's that scorpion again and in the mithras uh
attraction he's seen the scorpion is below the um is below the bowl but it turns out scorpio
was a gate of death remember heraclides writing that there were three paths of the soul in the
afterlife one was near scorpio that was the gate of death where one descended into the underworld
when gilgamesh descends into the underworld he passes a scorpion gate guarded by scorpion men
it's the same gate in the sky and so uh we this motif of ryan being stung on the foot by a scorpion
is astronomical sure enough but it's dealing with a metaphysics of rebirth that lost track of
so but in any case ryan is a good concierge over death by the waters and i'll tell you why
first off here's another calama
let me follow the picture anyway it is produced by starry night uh software which allows me to pick
the location on the earth and the time so here's the sea of galley at the time of jesus this is the
sky you would see okay and uh this is the fall months um where a ryan on the right there
is setting in the east the constellation of the argo or ship is seeing sailing on
waters as a sunset ryan is literally walking on the waters as the boat makes its passage
across the horizon so it's just an interesting coincidence that um if you were to stand on
the shore of the sea of galley you would see in the the fall stormy months ryan walking on the
water with a boat sailing behind him right and aryan is a good uh archetype for the savior
figure uh jesus and i'm going to get into that um anciently aryan was related to stormy waters
virginal horus pliny polybios all referred aryan with stormy epithets this due to the fact that
in the fall months aryan was seen sitting in the west as the sun rose in the east the fourth
night of the watch was the time right before dawn when jesus walks on the water and but it's also the
time uh when aryan is seen descending from the sky to drown below the horizon right before dawn
during the stormy season so it turns out the fourth night of the watch which is a really
interesting detail the gospel writers include why would you say that jesus walks on the water
at the fourth night of the watch it's just it seems like a superfluous detail but it just so happens
that at the fourth night of the watch aryan walks on the water with the boat argo behind him
during the stormy season when the storm overthrows the boat yeah that's just that's an interesting
coincidence coincidentally if standing on the shore of galley they would also see the
ship argo upon the waters well furthermore the motive of the boat of the disciples speeding
to the other side of the shore that's the gospel of john that's what he gives us just might be explained
by the fact that aryan appears with the sun for most of the year but quickly descends from the sky
during the fall months by winter solstice this constellation has disappeared with the rising
sun so summer and fall aryan sets as the sun rises but by winter solstice the sun is setting
and aryan rises in the west in other words aryan has transposed himself on the other side of the shore
from the sun are you getting that so here's a picture of that where in the winter solstice the sun
the sun on the right is setting and that is when aryan rises to walk on the waters and so aryan
rises in the east as the sun sets in the west aryan is disassociated from the rising sun is now seen
with the setting sun this disconnect from the rising sun explains many of the motifs in the
ancient myths including his rebirth cycle and association with the resurrection in different
religious traditions in other words um the rising sun is going is when he sets the setting sun is
when he rises he he gets disassociated from the solar cycle only to be re-associated with the rising
sun and so is seen as a motif of resurrection are you following that yes john you you have me
wanting to ask a vital question and yes it is controversial and um you know i know you've made
it clear um you you are a man of faith and so forth so this is a question i think uh and this is
just my journey everybody's on a journey right um and in my journey i feel as if let's suppose
hypothetically that uh the what we've been told by the church that one must believe a man physically
died and physically rose biologically from the dead including lazars etc etc etc okay let's
suppose that what we're talking about here astrologically in the resurrection that we're
seeing take in place this rebirth concept that we know is mythology all right is it we know it is
of deep deep esoteric and personal significance to every person in not only the writers of this text
but the context of the people that it was being spoken to and it look at what it's done through
history even though we've maybe interpreted things in so many ways there is a structure there's a
deep uh wisdom to the text no matter what you do on the onslaught of these you know
literal interpretations of certain things is it possible that these resurrection this resurrection
concept with jesus could very well be what we're talking about here in an oral type of sense yet
it's ritualized and it may not have actually been a necessarily a literal guy who actually did
those things not saying there wasn't a guy named jesus he could possibly have been but he might have
been a priest like we've talked about and he ritualized or had these motifs these mythological
motifs of wisdom uh incorporated into a story which i know i'm rambling i'm not trying to take
over the show but i'm just trying to make the point what if is this a possibility and have you
thought about that well look guys astral theology is scripture for oral people this is the this is
how they conceptualize their idea of the eternal and of rebirth and resurrection they they wed it
to patterns in the sky because that's their imprinting press so this is this is their scripture
and so um you know i your question is uh you know jesus could have been a historical figure i
personally believe jesus was historical i i find that the argument that of his non-historicity
a little bit silly um but um but but that doesn't mean that everything in the in the text happened
historically uh and what i think you're asking is could you know these things just be ritualized
uh traditions based off these old patterns that gets historicized in our text is that your
question yes something like that and that uh just to emphasize so i get a good answer because
i know i want to make sure i'm drilling this home i'm not saying did jesus exist or not that's
that's irrelevant uh i'm actually on offense i'm not a hundred percent sure either direction
but i'm fairly saying there's a likeliness that a guy named jesus that is based in this text
that's that's a rabbit trail my ultimate thing is let's just say he does exist this guy actually
did exist he was mythologized or if you will i hate to use that term um in your sense of
orality concepts of what we're seeing with this uh ancient tradition being shown do you think
it's possible that a guy named jesus actually didn't physically literally die and rise from the dead
but they took these uh wisdom patterns and applied them to him is that a possible
you know explanation instead of the literal historical understanding yeah that is a possible
explanation um i um guys why why is a uh a ritual explanation of an eternal truth
going to be substantively different than a historical explanation remember world people's
consider truth as cosmic facts literate peoples consider truth as historical facts right um
so a ritualized expression of you know couch sinastro theology is still getting at the same
eternal concept as a historical explanation and if you totally agree and say um if you come in and say
it's not historical therefore what you're believing isn't true then you've missed the oral uh
methodology altogether because there what they're saying is you can be resurrected i don't care
if jesus lived and resurrected i'm showing you in the sky in the earth in the patterns of nature
life dies and resurrects it does it every seasonal cycle and you are the culmination of the creation
in this right you too so i'm going to express this through uh myth ritual uh myth and ritual
we express it through historical narrative why uh why do we have to say that if it's
not historical it's not true um i agree with you man we don't look uh i can't answer for you derek
what's gonna happen to you when you die i i i just have my guesses purgatory for at least
three centuries yeah oh well you know what i'm gonna let my ancestors there derek hey hey i'll meet
you there thanks bar okay that is so wrong yeah right look i can't i can't explain to you uh what
no one can tell you what's going to happen uh when you die but for thousands of years for tens of
thousands of years there has been an existential uh decision and it's a conscious choice of faith
that most people believe that there is life after death and it turns out in these astro
theological systems they're not about calendar processes everything i just showed you on the
screen with a ryan being associated and disassociated with the sun that's where astro
theologers leave it and they say oh so this is what's actually being described and therefore you
and your belief of jesus wagging on water and him being a literal resurrecting savior you're just
believing it this is all just very telling you just they're missing the point entirely first off
they get the astro theology wrong in which i'm going to continue to do um i was going to read
you something out of my book mythos and cosmos which addresses your your question but it'll take
me too long to look it up um i let me just say a couple of things um how about this i mean we're
well beyond the 45 minutes i had you're gonna have to do all kinds of editing i am so sorry how are
you even recording this you gotta have like a six terabyte drive to record this thing um after
three thousand years in purgatory of acquiring the uh the most radical to say yeah that's right
dude i'm going to be there a lot longer than you let me just tell you um the uh the most
radical interpretation of the bible guys the most radical interpretation happens to be the
literal one i mean what if god actually showed up who would ever guess that i mean i mean seriously
what if god actually did appear on the mountain and speak to moses who would know it scholars would
know it that's outside of the scholarly methodology i mean if if jesus was resurrected the last people
who would ever know are the scholars all right um and so you know again this is a choice of faith
that you have to make because you can't prove it and um but john but john john history scratches
and itch yeah it'll it allows you to say ah and and and it and it doesn't really do much more
because somehow people think that something is real when it has an objective existence
apart from them and if it happened in history it means it's not dependent on on something as amorphous
as a consciousness or thinking or some being or it happened in a mind somehow it continues to exist
and persist outside of as i say a conscious being but really i think what people are saying is
it exists outside of me that that whether i'm here or not no matter what i think or don't think
this thing has independent existence and that just makes people feel good that's a very good would
you agree that's a very good insight luther i and i do agree history allows us to say ah
it scratches now i think that's a that's a i'm going to take that from you
i uh be my guests i think that's i well yeah that is true but you know look when it comes to the
terrible questions is their life after death is the soul eternal
what are you going to do with that science on such questions can only offer honest silence
religion is going to tell you what you should believe about it but uh you know the science
is going to say you can't believe that well i'm sorry but you you get nothing but science
silence mr science you have nothing this scientific method to discuss it
so shut up uh but then right and then so then you turn over here to the religious crowd
and you say all right religious crowd what are you going to do with this oh wait my priest
just killed his brother with a rock oh crap and so look these are existential questions
and so um well you you bring up another good point john like you you've got the
you've got the scientific side that can't answer it and most of the time they answer it
even though they can't really answer these questions and then you have correct you have
the opposite spectrum you've got the highly religious structured systems who claim to have
the absolute answers okay and they don't have they don't have the clue ultimately of knowing
they can say look we have experiences we have we have certain things you can you can take from
this you can you can internalize and figure out and have somewhat of a no or a gnosis if you will
to some extent um you can experience it but you have to carry our baggage by the way you have to
believe a guy was somehow um you know with everything that comes with the indoctrination
of the process and whatever that traditional view may be i mean you can talk about whatever
religious angle you want to take you can talk about muhammad in quran and you know but my
i'm just making a point rather than just the bible itself you have one or the other can we ride
the fence and say look i feel like there's a balanced understanding there's things we'll never
know we live in the mystery but we experience some things that we know to be true on an absolute
level does that make sense oh no i i agree i that that makes perfect sense because that's
what everyone does i i mean look i i we no one ultimately knows for sure the only people who know
if there's life after dead the death are the dead and um and if you're talking to the dead
no one's going to believe you because you're crazy so and so uh there's just you know so you
on the other hand on the other hand there are thousands of ndes near death experiences people
who've died and have come back and they've had this numinous experience and they've reported it and
there's actually thousands of these in every culture in every religious tradition that's
really interesting i you know i you know i don't study them but i just i that's very interesting
all i can say on the subject is i mean have you had numinous experiences experiences that
don't correspond to any rational process i have i've had a couple experiences which are actually
life changing and they're and they're you know semi mystical and um i i can explain them but it
does you know it does make me think wow there's something more beyond material existence so
i'm going to pay attention to that but all of this is a side argument guys you know um it was gk
chastritin that said the self is further than any distant star and that is a brilliant insight
our the real challenge in in conscious living is to discover who we are and you know what it's
i i don't know how many people actually do that it's it's easier to belong to a religion and
and live a religion and never discover who you are it's easier to become an atheist
and make fun of religion and never discover who you are discovering who you are
is finding the divine in yourself because the more you become yourself the more whole you become
the more holy you become you discover god when you discover yourself in vice versa and uh i um yeah
so i i i you know these are these are great metaphysical questions they're completely off
off subject but again you know look we live in the secular world uh that wants materialistic proof
and a lot of these religious issues you're just not going to get that and then we live in an era
where we want historical proof and it turns out you know that is jesus historical well we've got
all the evidence we're ever going to get and even if we found more evidence it would be easily
to explain away and so now you make your decision do you believe or do you not believe and then you
live with your decision that's what you get um and so um religion guys is a tool you know like a gun
you can you can use a gun to feed and protect your family you can use a gun to destroy and kill
or religion has been used to feed and protect in the noble and in grace and it's been used to
destroy and kill and so if you got rid of all the churches and religions on the world would we be
a much more reasonable uh people i'm going to tell you what the bible says and the bible says no
and it says no because of that story of kane enable the curtain opens religion hasn't even been
invented and the first thing people do is hit each other over the head with a rock you get rid of
religion and nothing changes people um and so uh human nature is human nature and you know the
purpose of religion is to examine human nature and find out who you are so you know that is the
most noble difficult quest and journey anyone could ever take on and requires enormous work
suffering and discipleship and so it requires belief that's for sure so you you make your decisions
and um and uh if if your decisions help you become an ennobled good person i'm going to support
you and i don't care what you call your god i don't care if you're an atheist i i if if you are
doing good um you know that the all of judyism is summarized in mica six here thou oh man what
god requires of thee to do justice to love goodness and to walk humbly before god yes that
that's my religion right there if you're doing justice if you're loving goodness and promoting
goodness and you're walking humbly before something you consider greater than yourself uh you're going
to be uh you're going to be wise you might be a goat herder or you might be a professor it doesn't
matter because it turns out most of the goat herders and most of the professors don't do that
so so it's it's it's a very difficult road a road filled with good and evil so you know there's
there's your sermon for the for the sunday that's good that's good you know this this is
yeah really really been amazing um that we took this to another level i mean this this thing went
from uh a little bit guys i'm not even done with my astrotheology look i have more slides what are
you doing he's got slides he's got slides darik john what are we doing here okay so so let me ask
you this guys we're three hours into the well eight eight minutes eight minutes away from three
hours into the program okay i'm gonna i'm gonna definitely have to do some tweaking but but
nonetheless um would you rather stop here and pick up where you left off or because here i can
already see what's gonna happen john you know we found a connection tonight we're in the zone
so what's gonna happen is he's gonna go through three four five more slides and he's gonna be like
i have 1700 more slides man like
and and luther's gonna be like yeah keep bringing them in man keep keep bringing them in bro i'm good
and i'm over here going guys i gotta get it five in the morning i actually i love it i love it more
slides but if i think we're past three hours i think we've got we've gone on i we probably i
probably need to go well uh that's what i was going to say we if we chop it off here man we
could pick up i really think people need to come back and check this out because there's three hours
here i'll try to divide this into three separate clips three hour clip three one hour clips because
it's meaty there's very few people just like you said there's not many goat herders and there's
not many people who are at the top who you know follow that path well it's very few people who
will spend three hours going through this content and if you're one of them i'm very thankful for
you um but we're gonna go through the one hour at a time separate these into parts and uh look
get the book mythos and cosmos by dr john lundwall john k lundwall because there are other
lundwalls and uh you don't want to be mistaken this is going to be oh man we found uh some magic
tonight did we not guys i don't know if it's i i'm glad you think it's mad
thick
who are in rare form not have been but right now you're in rare form and we get all of that
with you uh we got to have you back again uh you although you answered just about every
conceivable question i might have uh and and to boot just a lot to think about but uh
uh derrick what shall we what shall we do we've got enough material for uh maybe three shows
right now so if we can gently kind of bring things uh to a close and ask john if he wants
to make just some closing remarks right now would that be okay yeah let's let's go ahead john tell
him tell him how do they get your book uh how do they check you out websites give him some
information before we close this thing brother yeah again i haven't uh do you see me i turned
off my screen share um the uh i i i haven't created an online platform i just have my facebook
page you can get my book on amazon kindle or print barn's a novel online um and so uh i i am
developing guys uh you know here in another six months i'll actually be able to say hey you go
to this website and here i am and and here's all kinds of material you can you can look at
but that's that's down the road so until then people get me by looking at my youtube channel
and by watching a show like yours and by reading my book and you know what if they want to contact
me they can email me or message me i actually had um a couple people who watched your show last
time contact me so and i'm totally okay with that i would be happy to answer any questions
they can message me through facebook on my mythos and cosmos page and then i'll message them back
luther anything
i'm not hearing luther yeah thanks thanks my mute was still on sorry but as long as people can get
a hold of you john because uh you really have peak not just the interest but uh the soul's urgings
in uh in a lot of our listeners i think so we gotta have you down the rabbit hole of astral
theology i was just showing you the surface you know the calendric models i wasn't even i was
about to get into why arine is being used as a resurrection motif with water why orpheus is being
used that that's a whole another subject that the astral this yeah but john all roads lead
eventually to the same point man and you got exactly where you were supposed to get on this
particular show that's true and and and and we can't thank you enough we love you john uh we
gotta have you uh as often as you can make time for us uh ladies and gentlemen once again uh we

you said earlier luther history is like ah and i felt very lots of moments where i was like ah
but then john you said something as well the esoteric is like wow so you have the ah moments
and then you have the wow you know and and we had both of those moments tonight it's absolutely
true i mean we have ah and wow and you can't have one without the other sometimes and this was
not only a historical moment here on this show but also a wow moment that i look forward to the
next one i think this is going to be great but if you want uh more people of my caliber on your
shoulder may i suggest that you search the asylum's pubs in purgatory i'm afraid that the mics might
catch fire you know no okay hey guys it's been a pleasure thank you brother really thank you thank
