we are myth vision welcome to myth vision guys your host Derek Lambert I'm
here to bring you guys some special guests today Dr. Luther G Williams is
still editing the book be on the lookout you guys are showing some love
when that comes out let's get right into this I love this show that we're
about to do fascinated I'm a student of these two characters and these guys are
stand-up men that have been joining us on the podcast and they're going to
continue to bring you guys the truth as they see it and that they've done their
research we have Dr. Robert Eisenman and we have Christopher Lawson how are you
two gentlemen yes sir I figure why not jump in we'll go with the master first
Dr. Robert Eisenman has written many many books I will not list them all but I
will mention a few of them James the brother of Jesus okay and the Dead Sea
Scrolls he's got breaking the Dead Sea Scrolls monopoly Maccabees Zadokites
Christians and kumran he's written multiple versions of James the brother
of Jesus and go down in the description in this video be sure to get you a copy
they've got it in PDF he's got it in hardback preferably get the penguin
version that's the best version that he has and he encourages that version it's
a big one the Dead Sea Scrolls uncovered New Testament code and on and on and on
it goes he is definitely a scholar he's been a professor he's taught on Islam
the Bible and he's been very controversial he's even gone so far as to
suggest the the osuary of James the brother of Jesus was actually a fake
he's come out bold about a lot of things you've seen him on TV he's been on
it isn't his thank you for correcting me guys he's been on interesting okay
well you heard it from the man and well thank you so much for correcting me and
Christopher Lawson he has written some work right now he's got a book PDF
format reconstructing Jesus what if the historical Jesus was the heir to the
throne a reconstruction based on the first century Dead Sea Scrolls and that
ch. Lawson how are you two gentlemen doing I'm doing alright just having a
picnic up here to survive well let's dive right in guys because we want to talk
about this New Testament situation and the Dead Sea Scrolls I'd like to start
first off with what and we'll ask you Dr. Eisenman if you don't mind what made
you think these scrolls were dated around the New Testament or first century
context when all the other scholars say hey this is second century BC yeah but
they got everything wrong because first of all they have the enemies as the
Maccabees and these are totally in the spirit of the Maccabees you couldn't be
the enemies of the Maccabees with the aggressive militancy that you find in
the Dead Sea Scrolls so for one it's just that their mindset was already
oriented toward oh well the Maccabees this isn't Christianity these are some
aggressive militant revolutionary Jews this is nothing to do with us and
because we're dealing with churches and beautiful beautiful buildings with some
kind of a pagan iconography if someone hanging on a on a crawl so they
portray him you're not supposed to have images in you know Judaism you go into
these churches I just saw a whole program on this the other day that's why
it's in my mind and it's frightening to me it's frightening because it's pure
paganism would you like to tag on that because I'd like both of you to be able
to piggyback and and if you will collaborate on trying to give evidence
why what you see that makes you say hey these Dead Sea Scrolls aren't talking
second century the context of them are really dealing with the first century
issue between a pro-Roman sect and these messianics so one of the things that I
see is a big commonality between the whole Jesus movement and and the Maccabee
in history is the concept of a pious ending and the Maccabee brothers all
went to the end they went to the limit faithful unto death and that is a lock
step match to the Jesus movement Josephus said concerning the fourth
philosophy which I linked to the Jesus movement that these people were so
faithful unto death and face such tortures that it was impossible for
Josephus to do proper justice to the descriptions for his readers sake and
that he fears that his readers might not believe him but they if they don't
believe him they should believe that he's being too conservative in his
description if they have any doubt about what he's saying that these people took
horrible horrible painful deaths and they took it in stride even the kids
because they were going to be faithful to their heritage and they weren't going
to give it up at the last minute when they thought they were about to what
they thought they were winning a crown well the problem also with speaking
about Jesus is you have material written under erodian Roman auspices
basically mostly overseas in a foreign language and you can hardly prove a
Palestinian context to it so you don't know how much of it is is accurate you
you don't know that was my original problem in dealing with the different
Gospels they don't they contradict each other often anyway but you can't you
can't decide if this is Greco Hellenistic literature or if this is
Palestinian or is or Judeo I hate the word Palestinian but I can't use any
other one that's the area that the name of the Romans gave it on purpose but if
this is Judeo history of some kind and if it's Judeo history of some kind then
it doesn't look like what we have in the Gospels but if you look at Paul's
letters there's where you find history you can find the authentic letters of
Paul you can find history so once you start pulling the material out of the
authentic letters not all of them are authentic but the main ones are you can
really reconstruct something of what happened there and then you see the
character of Paul knows something about is James the brother of Jesus and it's
quite clearly he even calls him the righteous one the Sadiq so once you
start picking up on these things and then the acts is the same as the Gospels
until you get to the latter part the we document and when you get into the we
document from around chapter 16 onwards then you're getting quite a lot of
history if not completely historical and the climax comes in Acts 21 21 when
Paul meets James and comes up to Jerusalem and you see James as the
leader of the early church and Paul has to do with James says and James sends him
into the temple to do something that he's totally opposed to that is pay the
expenses with the money he has of four people under Nazarito and he's against
any of these things you see from his letters anyhow he's against the law he's
against all of these things but he has to do it in order to show his
subservience to James so when you start picking up on these things you start you
can reconstruct the history and that's how you move over towards the Dead Sea
Scrolls and away from the Gospels and when you're looking for the history of
Jesus I've always taken the idea that the only piece of the puzzle that really
is testable is the idea of royalty the idea that Jesus is part of the the royal
family and if so then James is part of the royal family and while we were
talking about acts the hit James role in Acts when you come to the that section
that Dr. Eisenman just cited for us you find James sitting on a throne it says
Throne Oaks and it said James says I judge he used the word krino and then
after James does his judgment everybody else in opposition to James backs off so
it does look like James has a commanding rule now is that it does that imply our
royal role or a priestly role or both together that's one can argue by one can
argue in favor of both actually well I don't know where you get the idea of a
royal family from except the Gospels you know there's nothing in the scrolls
about the righteous teacher being part of the royal family they don't talk about
the royal family at all in fact they're very much opposed to whoever impersonating
the royal family like the Erodeans at this time and so to talk about the royal
family what royal family there is no royal family I'm around 500 BC on to a
hundred eighty I mean this is just imagination to some extent but they're
what the scrolls are centered about is righteousness righteousness that's what
makes you a son of God they're interested in sonship not royalty they're
interested in symbolic sonship and it is this righteous righteousness ideology
the the so-called sons of Zadok the sons of the priesthood the Zadokite
ideology and then that's where you find the James character fitting in and the
reason I put the Jesus character in is because at the end I say who and whatever
James was so was Jesus you can't reconstruct Jesus until you reconstructed
James and if you try to do it from the sources that you have then you're just
getting into a Greco Roman mystery cult I would say the Dead Sea Scrolls imply
the royal heir to the throne when it talks about the branch of David and
their expectations of the branch and they link the idea of the branch to the
unique teacher so do they identify him with anyone I don't know well gentlemen
I don't think they identify anybody clearly I think they just give
descriptions of the various characters and we have to do it anyway you know
more about the descriptions they have than I can remember because I haven't
looked at this material in 15 years so I really can't pull it out of my brain
anymore you know we've got to dust the cobwebs off right well here well you've
done a lot of great work you remember more than I've ever learned I'm sure so
yeah well let me ask you guys this question because they always go to
carbon dating okay this is there they're always throwing that up in the face
right maybe we could deal with that but in light of that my question is this
context-wise or in contextually is there any contemporary to the second or
first century BC that you think this could even fit the narrative of the
situation then I mean no but as far as the carbon dating goes you can't get
that kind of precision that they're claiming that they get I have a whole
attack on the carbon dating of the of the of the Dead Sea Scrolls they don't
bother reading and I've been attacking the carbon dating since the 1980s you
know what good does it do they go back to it because that's their only crux that
they have they have this pseudo dating that they rely on when in fact internal
internal dating you know internal historical dating that you can get
where you're clearly not attacking the Maccabean family you're attacking the
Roman Herodian establishment and once you understand that in the Dead Sea Scrolls
then you move forward so I mean these folks are never going to change and we're
we're never going to come to any agreement on it but the point of the
matter is that the that the establishment that's being attacked in the
Scrolls has nothing to do with the Maccabees therefore it's not second
century it's not even first century it's around late first century BC into the
first century CE. Would you like to add something to that Chris? Yes when it
comes to the carbon dating the carbon dating is not a specific date a lot of
people have the misconception that the scientists pour in the data and their
computer comes out an exact date it's more of a range and so they have a first
sigma distribution range and a second sigma distribution range and the first
sigma distribution range the date is 60 is a two-thirds probability that the
actual date in there but the second sigma distribution it's a 95 percent chance
date would be in there because it's a larger range and so when you look at the
range of the Dead Sea Scrolls community the range in the first sigma
distribution is already a broad swath that goes from the first century BC all
the way up to the first century AD they're very both ends of it. Yeah and so that's
their margin of error they have a huge margin of error. Exactly. So I mean rather
than talk about carbon dating and I want to keep talking about carbon dating
because it's such a pseudo science anyway for this period because you know you
don't have enough dated manuscripts you don't have anything like that and you're
you're trying to talk out of Paul Kloth and use this against internal
information which is so clear and so raw and sophisticated is that's the
problem in this field we're dealing with people who are unsophisticated in
historical literary analysis and so they they fall back on a pseudo analysis of
a subject that is totally unreliable. Well Professor Eisenman I'm glad that you
segue into something different because that is a obviously someone can do some
digging and figure out that there isn't that many second century BC first century
BC writings so something to compare as a like like you said previously Christopher
a control by which you would test this. By the horse they're using the Dead Sea Scrolls as their
actual material from that period. Looking at evidence within the scrolls for the
first century dating for first century CE dating. There's a lot of evidence in
there. First of all the evidence of the zealots and their activities it matches
Yigel Yudin and Andrei Dupont's summer both say I mean Yigel Yudin and Andrei
Dupont they say that the War Scroll matches the first century army manuals
of the Romans and then Cecil Roth and G.R. Driver linked the scrolls to the first
century zealot movement. Barbara Thering said there's a first century pattern and
commentary style that matches in the Bible and in the scrolls. There's all sorts of
reasons for a first century provenance. Dr. Eisenman you mentioned the delay of
the Perusia in some of the scrolls and that's an indication for the later date
of the scrolls of first century. I also bring in the evidence for the parables in
the scroll there's all kinds of parables and that's an indication of the
first century. So gentlemen let me ask both of you this question. I want both
of your opinions if you don't mind. Why were the Gospels written? I mean what do
you think the motivation for writing those Gospels or at least the four
years? It's obvious to subvert the Messianic movement in Palestine. I say
that the scrolls represent the Messianic movement in Palestine. That's what the
scrolls are. That's not what my colleagues said the scrolls are. They
don't know what the scrolls are. They think the scrolls are Essenes. You look at
Essenes they're not supposed to be peaceful Essenes you know contemplating
their navels not not aggressive and so on and yet Hippolytus in the second
century tells us there are four groups of Essenes among whom includes Zellot
Essenes and Sicari Essenes and we know that the Sicari were the people that
occupied Masada that were called Sicari because they supposedly cut people's
roads in assassination attempts and ultimately committed suicide on Masada
and we found scrolls on Masada so we know that these two movements are linked
in some way and it's obviously that they are. So what I say is yes this is a
Messianic movement in Palestine. This is not the Essenes that people like to
imagine. Yes these are Essenes perhaps but they're aggressive Essenes that is
Sicari Essenes Zellot Essenes and once you can grasp that the peaceful Essen model
is only a model in the mind of our pseudo scholars all over the universe
and the ones who play games with with carbon dating and know nothing about
history and the interpretation of texts and text interpretation then you
start you start moving away from this and you'll go back to the literature
and text itself and they've never emphasized not to mention appreciated
that these texts are totally Messianic so you have a Messianic movement in
Palestine totally the opposite of the Greco-Hellenistic Romanized
Polarized movement that you get in the Gospels and the Jesus in the Gospels
is created in the image of Paul line literature and Paul line argumentation now
in the Gospels there are some real parts that Jesus said are preserved but it's
not the parts that the Bible Thumpers like it's the ugly parts of the Jesus
story that they wouldn't have made up in making
picture look prettier later such as Jesus saying if you don't have a sword
sell your cloak and buy one or come not to bring peace but a sword
these these parts match the zealot movement
the idea that Jesus called the syrophoenician woman
and her child dogs this matches the xenophobia
of the zealot movement and that also by the way is another tie back to the
Maccabines the xenophobia and the political nature
they combine their politics and their religion yeah no native Palestinian is
going to be marrying a Phoenician woman exactly so for Jesus to say
their dogs shows a very realistic clip about Jesus
that the story got preserved because the Phoenician woman apparently knew her
place accepted her role as a dog and say yeah but even the dogs get
crumbs and so this showed that she had faith in the
story got preserved otherwise we wouldn't have had that part of the story
deserve either but if you call of course you have
Paul's so-called mission to the Gentiles that is
totally either reconstructed or created or imagined himself
so yes fine you can have a mission to so-called Gentiles
in the Asia Minor peninsula in the Greco-Roman
universe of southern Europe but the point of the matter is
first these people have to convert to Judaism
before they can be heir to the prophecies that were promised to the
Jews and of course this is annoying to the Roman authorities
who see the Jews as a minor troublesome people always involved in
revolution always involved in in protest and of
course they're not going to be sympathetic to any material
that is that is messianically inspired that has to do with
that being Jewish no of course not so Paul refurbishes the whole thing
and he as I show at the end of my little books and a lot of my books
Paul is from the Herodian family Paul says at the end of Romans and I
take that literally give my regards to my kinsmen the
littlest herod the youngest herod Herodian means the young
he reveals right there that he is a devin Jewish
in fact he comes from that the Herodian family
came from that area that we now call the Gaza the Gaza strip
and they took over Jewish Palestine by slaughtering all the Maccabees
the Jewish heroes that the Jews supposedly loved in the Maccabee
books and so on so we have a totally anti-Jewish ethos
of this Paul of this colonized material and that's what survived and that's
why you have the Holocaust that's why you have anti-Semitism
and that's why it's still endures to this day and it will go on because
unfortunately as beautiful as the Gospels are and I say they are beautiful
but they're anti-Semitic and as long as you are walking around with an
anti-Semitic guidebook in your pocket you're going to have a tough time
fighting off anti-Semitism you know church fathers right off the bat
totally agree I mean if you just research how anti-Semitic
these these pagan church fathers really were
it's it's quite interesting so I didn't mean to cut you
yeah Christopher I'm sorry I cut you off no we can all take turns
just to get back to some of the links to to the zealot movement
and to the militarism of this movement that the Essenes were not
all the peace lovers that the Sicarii that you can sell to the name came from
the name of their blade it was called Ossica in Aramaic and Sicae in
Latin and linking the zealot movement at
Masada to this group we have scrolls at Masada
of the songs of the Sabbath sacrifice and also the book of Jubilees and these
are both identical to the scrolls from the
humane caves by the way the deaths are the people at Masada they believed in
the resurrection and had hope in it because
they had a scroll buried under their synagogue at Masada
and the scroll was a scroll of Isaiah I'm not Isaiah Ezekiel 37
which talks about the dry bones gaining flesh etc so they were treacherous because
they're looking forward to the resurrection right because they knew
that we're going to commit suicide right so so on that note I think this is a
good time to segue into something I'd like to ask
professor Isaman his opinion on I know your opinion Christopher you were on
the show recently and kind of expressed the idea of the 40 years
um Paul has this three days and three nights
resurrection idea of Jesus okay he's he's spouting that this Jesus character
did die and rose again and I was thinking of the context where it talks
about the heresy of phyleetus and hymenaeus how they had perceived that
the resurrection had already happened um my question
professor Isaman you in in light of the James movement which is tied in with
this Jesus character that has obviously been politicized
hellenized whitewashed completely romanized
and washed over from being what we're looking at here the kumran sect
um do you believe that the original movement that this man was put to death
possibly by Pontius Pilate in the 30s and that they really did believe he
rose again then or maybe they thought he was going to rise again in the future
and Paul was teaching that a resurrection already happened
how do you where do you put the the idea that they thought he really rose again
from the dead at is that a later concoction and
is that inserted into Paul you think or do you think Paul really taught
there was a Jesus who rose again from the dead in the 50s
well you've thrown in so many aspects or questions here in one
in one in in one phraseology that it's very difficult for me to
yes i'm sorry but i would say this it's all right i would say first of all you
have to realize it this is all hellenistic
greco-roman ideology in terms of a person uh you know actually
rising from the dead and returning to walk on earth and all you get that in
the greek literature you know you you get those things in in greco-roman
literature you don't get this thing in any palestinian
jewish literature i hate to use the word palestinian but i can't help it
you know you don't get this this picture at all
you don't get it in the Dead Sea Scrolls they may
allude to um as chris was saying they may they may allude
to um a um resurrection later world in the other you know in the other universe
but they haven't got there yet and the war scroll
talks about the final apocalyptic war against all evil on the earth
being led by the angels who are going to join their camps so these just have war
like movement this is not a peaceful movement this is not a turn the other
cheek movement now i know turn the other cheek is
very appealing i mean that's what we love it and i'm not against it and if you
love it you love it but that is not what was going on in
palestine that was the way of subverting the palestinian messianic
movement to make it pacifistic and pro-roman and and and until you can
approve i mean as beautiful as it is until you can appreciate what they're up to
and know what the i don't say the scrolls are beautiful no not necessarily
because the scrolls are interested in one concept basically only
righteousness and righteousness is not necessarily a beautiful thing
righteousness is sometimes very harsh very you know
being very stern being very uncompromising
and being not the least bit peaceful in your attitude
and that's unfortunately what the scrolls are so they don't attract
and the gospels do attract them not against them
all that makes me angry is to is to is to attach this to jewish literature
and to claim that this was going on in palestine and to recreate a person
that we have no proof even what was like that therefore if you don't look at
james you can't know what this character was
and we do get a picture of james as i said from paul's letters
the end of ax and you glue this into the righteous teacher at comron
you can begin to develop a picture but nowhere does it talk about you know
uh turning the other cheek uh
kissing someone who's died or all that kind of thing
this is all greco-halinistic literature not history
now for an alternative interpretation that it that still fits with what you're
saying that uh that's still a militaristic idea
is it possible that the turn the other cheek concept
was part of their of the g the original jesus movements
advice for agents were not in question by wrong
how do you know there even was one where why i'm talking about something
you have no palestinian proof of you don't know nothing about it
a palestinian jesus movement except from overseas sources
where where do you come of you you know a james but you don't know anything about
a palestinian jesus movement well i see james you just imagine this because
you're still glued into the gospels the gospels have
totally have taken over your mind and they have
they have totally uh influence your whole outlook on the world
no i i i i i think you must you possibly misunderstood what i was
trying to get at actually i i think that it it i'm just suggesting
that it could have been a co a way of keeping
their activity covert as they were planning their war against rome
uh and they're being questioned by rome to turn the other cheek and don't give
away that you're a zealot don't give away that you're a revolutionary
keep it a secret i'm just thinking of the kind of logic that's expressed in
me uh sarah how you're hot uh
they describe what jesus itself is a greco roman name i mean what name you're
going to give this character in palestinian you want to talk about a
movement in palestinian then you got to call talk about a joshua movement or
something let's skip the movement concept i just
want to get to the idea of the turn the other cheek concept and i'll get to the
move back yeah turning our cheek idea i think is a
uh a way of don't give yourself away before
the righteous man will have everlasting hate i can't hear him anyway
we're losing you chris okay i'm right up against my mic can you hear me
yeah now at that at that last moment yeah okay
all right must i might have a bad i can't hear you again can you hear can you
hear me now can you hear me now yeah okay i'll keep the mic
still the desi's quote the sarah how you had the rule of
community how can we go to the internet like that
the rule of the community says everlasting hatred
for the men of the pit in clandestine spirit he should be a man
yeah no no turning in love there no exactly so this i think that the turn
the arrow cheek if it was at all part of the original movement and it may not
have been but if it was it was probably more in the
context of don't give your covert agency away
could it be go the extra go the extra mile in the roman
roads and don't let them know that you're one of the leaders of the zealot
movement and that way you stay alive for another day
that's plausible but but um what do you think about this idea chris and
professor isamin what i mean to me you have that is a possibility
to me it's more likely though that this is like a instruction manual on trying
to tell people do this you know for the roman so
like it's like a pro roman type of slant i get
what you're saying but it just was the new testament used it that way the new
testament definitely used it to say be nice to the romans because the new
testament is all pro roman is it to hide who these people are possibly but i
kind of wonder with all the other stuff that adds up in it
is this really an authentic what we're seeing movement here going on in the
gospels jesus even associates with roman centurions i mean
in the gospels you know this is you know for a palestinian messianic
movement a leader to to have anything to do with a
a roman centurion this is this is in another universe
yeah it it is and especially when you read about
the whole idea of cornelius being converted as a centurion
that whole nonsense especially since the uh they
josephus mentions the italian regiment in cesarea
and says that they were specifically anti-semitic and they did such horrible
they were the worst of all yeah they were the worst of all and
josephus refused to even describe the atrocities uh because they
so that's how bad they were it's obviously a rewrite
uh so the the the new testament is saying okay here's the
the centurions uh they recognize jesus first uh
you know surely he's the son of god the romans are enlightened
uh pilots is what crime has he done the new testament portrays the romans as
enlightened yet the jews they see jesus he raises the
dead uh he had he he feeds the four thousand he
feeds the five thousand uh he walks on water uh he
does one miracle after night he goes whole villages
all these miracles all over the place and the jews just can't get it that this
is the guy they've been looking for it's obviously anti-semitic
opum well it's obviously literature too it's not you know no one's walking on
the waters except in people's imaginations and
and their desire to have something miraculous that
happen in their universe because they're all gonna uh you know
die in the end and they don't want to think about that so they want to believe
in in mirror in miraculous things greco-roman literature allows them to
Judaism never did so let me ask this question and i know this is the big
topic i mean everybody get you know professor isamans book
james the brother of jesus okay this this book is
super important that unbelievable amount of information i want to ask you one
question if i know you probably speculate there was a guy named jesus but
is it possible that there wasn't a guy named jesus but really james was
actually the movement's leader and then the romans
made him have a brother to take the attention off of james do you think
it's possible i don't see any reason why uh
james couldn't have had a brother called jesus i mean i told you
that i consider most of paul's letters authentic
and in the letter to the galatians paul actually does with the gospels and the
roman literature usually doesn't even do or acts that is
he says james is the the brother of jesus
and you know he he sent up to see james the brother of jesus in jerusalem who's
the leader of of the movement and we're thinking in the
gospel terminology oh you mean james the brother of john oh you mean this is all
diversionary material to throw you away from james the
brother of jesus they only towards the end begin to talk
about there could be a brother of of jesus called james and stop
stop forgetting about james and john the sons of zebedee when they both get
killed in the gospels so that therefore you know when another
james suddenly appears who is he who is he who is he
so the point is that originally the zebedee brothers i used to like to call
them zippity-doodle the the zebedee brothers
are are are are um
something to take your attention away from the real
james and talk about these odd people that the gospels have created
a historical people now i would like to get back to
something that uh derrick asked earlier and that's about the 40 year wait
yeah please do the the zebedee scrolls keep on
mentioning that it's going to be 40 years till the destruction of all the
wicked men who turned back with the man of the lies it's going to be 40 years
until the uh the the righteous teacher
popped up out of the mass document too
now we're losing you chris we're losing you brother okay can you hear me now
yeah that one yeah okay uh now
damascus document fragment two lines 13 to 15
now from the day when the unique teacher was taken until the overthrow of all
the fighting men who turned back with the man of lies
there shall pass about 40 years uh the commentary on psalm 37 says
on fragment one line 68 at the end of the 40 years they will be wiped out and
on the earth not a wicked man will be found
but those are not historical documents those are visionary documents
we don't know if they're accurate those things
well i agree they're visionary documents but i think they took the time
the pesturim are different the pesturim actually that's why
usually just deal with the pesturim i don't deal with these other documents
to that extent the pesturim the the the the the the uh the jewish word for
commentary uh the word for commentary they actually
deal with historical situations and if you zero in on the
commentaries pesturim then you can start to reconstruct a real historical
situation not these general visionary
documents that well then then let's go to one of the pesturim
let's go to the psalm pesturim from cave four uh the psalm pesturim cave four
i mean uh column uh two it says they will die by the sword by hunger and by
plague and then it quotes psalm 37 a short while
yet and the wicked man will no longer exist i will stare at his place they
will longer be here its interpretation concerns all the
evil at the end of the 40 years for they should be devoured and upon the
earth no wicked person will be found again it's the same idea
it's coming up in the pesturim as i i cited well i can't follow what he's
saying so it doesn't do me any good so technically uh
what he's saying is that the it's the same idea that there's this 40 years and
then the end of all wickedness was supposed to happen
and i suspect we're tying this into the first century visionary that this is not
an historical uh analysis that's a visionary analysis
i think you have let me finish when you have the righteous teacher
confronting the spotter of lying and it tells what
is happening between them that's an actual historical situation
that's not a visionary situation that's something that's actually happening
then and there and through those episodes like in paul's letters
when he encounters uh james and james sends him into the temple and so on
those are real historical situations you can reconstruct something
from a visionary text you can you can imagine but that doesn't tell you real
history right i i agree with that a hundred percent
dr iceman uh the text i was quoting was from the psalm
pesher from k4 and i was quoting apart from the interpretation they can have
visionary material in the pesturim i'm only talking about the historical
material when you have confrontations arguments uh
interactions between people not something that looks forward to
an imaginary future that may or may not be real
exactly i understand that it's real necessarily because someone is having a
vision if i had a vision now and told you know in 50 years
trump is coming back to rule the universe are you gonna believe me
well let's hope not i'm talking to the narrator are you gonna believe me of
course you're not you guys are funny tell you if i tell you
today trump is arguing with the people who oppose him
ah you're gonna you're gonna accept that right
yeah okay okay um let's uh let's shift topics here yeah let's shift
let's shift topics okay so so gentlemen it it looks like to me and there's like
a reverse of role okay this is like you talked about the context of what's
going on in here the the situation that we're finding
in the new testament and in the epistles you've pointed out dr iceman
that the language being utilized even by paul
that he is aware of the literature of the kumran sect and he's flipping it on
its head almost like purposely reversing the roles
and making the enemy the the friend and the friend the enemy
and the light the people of light are darkness and darkness is light he flips
it on its head do you guys want to talk about some details about these things i
can't pull them out of my head now but you're right there and the point of the
matter is is that i think we should move over to
to paul the roman empire paul's roman citizen what's his ship what's he doing
walking around with a roman citizenship uh you know he gets that from his
herodian family roots his herodian origins and so on
all the erodians in had herodian had roman citizenship
in perpetuity in honor of herod the destroyer of the of the jewish people
in the maccabean family anyway we go over to this
this pauline roman universe and the romans of
course destroy the jewish revolution in palestine
they cause all of the messianic zealot type of individuals to
to kill themselves on masada and so on the ones that haven't killed already
they wipe it all out people want to know what happened to the messianic movement
some fled down into egypt a few got down there
and maybe got down to the arabian peninsula
then we talk about the the wilderness camps the war scroll talks about the
wilderness camps there's more the kumran is one camp
it's not the only camp so there are camps in northern syria some of those
probably survived and went into islam that's why islam
so resembles the dead sea scrolls muhammad never saw a dead sea scroll
but those people in the northern syrian context where he was involved in his
trade routes and in egypt where he visited and so on and so forth
and the chiroganiza ends up with an actual you know scroll document
those those people did survive so i would say
85 percent of the well of the uh of the revolutionaries
were were liquidated in one form or or or another the other jews who did survive
cooperated with the romans and became somewhat of what judeism is
up to the present era before israel was established that's why the jews couldn't
fight during the holocaust they didn't know how to fight anymore
they didn't know how to oppose the secular authorities they cooperated
with the secular authorities to the extent of sacrificing themselves to them
during the nazi period and very few ghettos were like the
war soul ghetto actually fought like that you know most of them went
peacefully people understand how come they went peacefully to the camps
because they'd already learned this 2000 years before during the war against
room and and and and this was going on for another
2000 years in their history the ones that did survive
and this beat this turned into rabbinic judeism but rabbinic judeism is not the
scrolls which is why the rabbis generally are not terribly
sympathetic to the scrolls in terms of ideology but as you see
being a scroll minded person i am sympathetic to the ideology of the
scrolls i like their aggressiveness i'm not interested in turning the other
cheek i like their their call for righteousness
and i like the fact that they think all the righteous ones are the true sons of
god i believe if you're perfectly righteous
which is hard thing to be then you turn into a real son of god and there isn't
and there isn't just one there are multitudes as many
as there are righteous ones interesting
is it is it really no i i i was gonna say interesting and i wanted to
chris can you hold that thought for one second because i wanted to ask professor
isamin one quick question and you could just say yes or no if you don't mind
and that way i never say yes okay we're going
okay um let me put it like this can i could i become if i wanted to could i
become a son of righteousness and be according to the to the scrolls
uh could i become one if i followed and really committed is it something that i
would be able to do i think first of all you i don't know what
conversion means or anything like that but you have to convert to the uh to the
ten commandments to all of those things basically what
Judaism used to be i'm not talking about the rabbinic Judaism that we're talking
about now i'm talking about the the the the the early primordial form of
Judaism that the new christians would have encountered
in these teachers that went that went overseas to various places
not the colonized ones the aggressive kumrun type ones
and uh once you were willing to do that i think yes absolutely so take just
because i'm not biologically from no it's not a blood thing it is not a blood
thing it's a behavioral thing okay thank you sir christopher what were you
going to say sir sorry to interrupt i i kind of lost where i was going to go
but i still have something i want to talk about otherwise
yeah please do the overseer at kumrun he was said to be a master of all the
mystery don't keep talking about kumrun because i don't have the
documents in front of me i thought we're talking about general history here
uh okay well he was going to talk about the overseer um
yeah i just wanted to talk about he keeps going back to the scrolls if you
want to just interpret these scrolls that's just another person interpreting
the um scrolls they're they're about uh 50 60 people
doing this and none of them agree with each other on everything
so it doesn't do us any good to try to do better than them
it's better for us to to to look at the whole period
and try to understand the whole period and what was going on
not what an individual scroll document says about that period
right i'm not i'm not dealing with a particular scroll document i'm i'm
thinking about paul snipe in first princey is 13
where he says uh if i even if i have all knowledge
and i know all mysteries and i can speak with the languages of men and angels if
i don't have love i'm nothing i'm wondering if you think that
sounds like it's being specifically directed at the overseer of kumrun
who had to be a master of all mysteries and uh have all knowledge and the
apparent was alleged to have spoke with the angel
i'm wondering did you catch that isamin okay so
paul and first carinthians uh seems to be what appears
to christopher addressing um the leader or one of the leaders correct christopher
of the kumrun the overseer the overseer do you think that that might be what
what's going on he wanted your insight to see if you thought maybe paul
is kind of addressing these people and maybe but i don't think so
no i don't think so you don't think he's addressing no i don't think he's
i don't think he's doing anything he's just stealing their documents
their their uh their ideology their concepts reversing them
and moving on i don't think he's talking he's not arguing with the people in
the scrolls at all he's just walking on with their material
but i think in fact he spent time at kumrun and he knows their
their ideology and and doctors in order to be able to use it and
reverse it and i think he was expelled from the kumrun community
he was one of the people that was expelled and thrown out
so he's not addressing any leader of the kumrun community
he's gone off into the into the into the new world with his roman citizenship
his his roman connections his erodian connections
he's got tremendous advantages and he's often running
in what we now know is the paul gene pal mission
i agree with that completely i was just thinking he was insulting me over here
oh so he's thinking that that that paul's actually insulting he's trying to
insult the kumrun community okay yeah so
what we're gonna have to do chris we're gonna have to find a way to get you a
mic because i think there's a lot of misunderstanding because they're not
able to hear you as clear as he wants to go
i've been picking up on that it's okay hey look
it's okay that's what i'm here for you know i have the gift of being able to
interpret tongues no i'm just kidding you know you can you can
rephrase what people say and say it to the other
party so they get the right meaning so what is going on here you you mentioned
the history the overlap you want us to look at the history
professor isaman and see what's going on overall and i think that's where a lot
of people miss the point um especially people who believe
in the new testament for example well they they're drinking the kool-aid but
but uh if you actually start looking at the overall image
this seems like a political machine that what we're seeing in the people don't
know there was a war in palestine if you tell them there was a huge war in
palestine where the revolutionary jews were liquidated
you tell them this kind of thing they're like why why did i say we say don't read
joseph's just uh joseph's war read his you know
antiquities and so on but they also don't know that there was a new roman
emperor emperor coming into being the flavian dynasty
and they were the roman generals in palestine and the weirdest thing was
recently i saw something that was talking about the
monuments in roman they were talking about the coliseum
and they were explaining that this was built immediately after the jewish war
by uh by by vespasian and titus and it has a
dedicatory plaque on it that no one ever looked at
this was says was built by titus or or or or or uh vespasian
i'm not sure which with the money that they took from their defeat of the
jews in palestine in other words this was taken from the boot
the coliseum itself was built from jewish booty money and nobody even knows
that so you don't even you're starting in a world of total ignorance
and then you start there and then you can get them start moving
do you think and i mean i like to speculate i'm a big speculator guy i
mean i just enjoy these things do you think it's possible i hope you don't lose
any money speculating hey hey i'm not betting anything i'm just
playing games i mean the stock market i'm talking
let me ask you this because this is a fascinating point you found that
that that's written there that's clearly built off the money that was taken from
the war do you think it says actually on the actual
on the only inscription they found on the coliseum stone
was this little inscription that says it was taken from the money
that the flavians or vespasian or titus which one
i don't know got or took or or or had
available to him from the war against the jews in palestine
yes that's what the coliseum says and who and who
has ever heard that before this even i had my you know i'm i i i it just
it just amazed me you actually brought that up last time and now it makes me
wonder if the situation i didn't know it last time
well um i'm talking about when you me did a show you mentioned this to me and
luther last time and i just it refreshed me we didn't do a show too
long ago but i was going to ask you something that
makes me think we we we date the gospels post
destruction of the temple and i just learned this about two months ago so i
don't know when we did it i i think you dropped it the last
time we were here but either way okay that's a fascinating piece of evidence
that i wonder if the gospels are trying to poke at because
jesus comes on says tear down this temple and i will rebuild it in three days
well this is a romanized version of the story
could it be that this is kind of way of saying we're going to build our own
temple this is all magical talking this is
Hellenized hopeful hopeful literary activity being
expressed and uh you know i mean you will never find this in any
jewish literature and you will find it in the Dead Sea Scrolls
what rebuild the temple in three days a person is going to rebuild the temple in
three days i mean this is never going to happen it
never was going to happen in fact i would say we don't want it to happen why
we don't want a priesthood back we if you have built a temple you've got to have
sacrifice of animals i don't want animal sacrifice
i don't want priests doing sacrifice i would never rebuild the temple
i would leave it in ruins period and i would build a shrine on the temple
mount not where the temple or the mosque is i don't have to disturb
the islamic shrines they want a shrine up there let them have a shrine up there
but i would build a commemoration of the return of the jews to palestine israel
on the temple mount a shrine to commemorate the return
of the jewish people to their land i wouldn't i wouldn't dictate any what
they should do like kill animals and sacrifice animals for seeing in all
this kind of you know very very primitive old
fashion behavior christopher you have something you'd
like to add sir uh as far as uh shrines in israel
no i'll leave that to someone who's from israel
and someone who's i don't have a stake in it there so i don't have a say let them
kiss the rhodian stone if they want yeah no he he said he'd rather leave that
to someone like you who who's from there and is aware of the area and all this
feels i feel it's very passionately i'm i'm a i am a nationalist i believe in that
i wouldn't even allow the people to kiss the stones where they kiss on the
wailing so-called wall because those stones were put up by heron on the backs
of jews that he slaughtered jews revolutionary jews the maccabean jews
and so on those are herodian stones and an herodian temple
that i consider illegitimate now the jews kissing those stones they're
expressing an emotion that they have fine they don't know what herod was they
don't know what these stones represent someone has to stand up in front of
them and say no stop don't do this pull these
stones down go up to the temple mount mount
don't build a temple we don't want priests again build a shrine you want to
you you you you want something to kiss to express your emotion of having
returned to this country fine go up why why can't you go up on the on the on
the temple mount if the world doesn't want you there i would
i would i would um what do you call it when you annex something i would annex it
i wouldn't play this this this game that that that they're forced to play
that they can visit it in small numbers now if they if they behave very very
nicely no no this was taken after a huge
amount of suffering after six million people were slaughtered
and so on by a few survivors who were able to return
and fight their way to um jerusalem my great grandfather
walked to jerusalem from viala russia in the 1880s and 1890s
and he settled in uh jerusalem and he's buried on the mount of olives
and uh and he took two of his sons with him who
had a family there i don't know if there's there's still i'm not in touch
with those people but i knew do know where his uh where his um
grave is on the mount of olives and after the six-day war i refurbished it
and i fixed it up because it had been thrown over by the arabs or palestinians
whoever you want to call them and i bought 10 tunes for my family
on the mount of olives so that they could be near him not right next to him
because that's all taken but there it was there were um empty empty spaces i
built spaces and i put my father up there and i put my mother up there
and uh in two of them that that i bought and i have eight left
and uh uh i'm my my great grandfather is there
and uh that's what we did we walked he walked to palestine all the way he
went to constantanople and from from viala russia
two sons came to america i'm descended from that part of his family
two of others went with him younger ones went went with him to palestine
their cousins and so on i don't know very very much at the moment
but that that that his what he did there and and and the fact that he worked
all the time in a public service institutional hospital
was honored by giving him and his wife a graveside on the mount of olives
speaking of graves i wanted to ask you about this uh this is an interesting
discussion i think you might appreciate this uh mr lawson
um do you think they found the grave of james the brother of jesus and maybe
jesus do you think they found these guys yeah you
wanted to come to that house where i know you wanted to yes sir i was going to
ask your opinion on it because you the literature says that he was buried
where he fell after he was pushed from the temple wall
that's in yusebius quoting an earlier source
and um that you can see where he would have been pushed from the temple wall
and uh later killed where he fell uh and buried there and then the literature
later literature says that there was an osherway somewhere in the um some of the
churches there the sort of um more not the not the roman so called
but more the greco uh Byzantine type of uh of christianity churches
and then that disappears now i don't know if uh according to the later
materials and beliefs the Santiago de Compostela in northern spain
which is the center of a pilgrimage is the burial place of james the brother
of jesus uh okay they talk about james the zebedee maybe but it's the burial place of
james and the osherway there is an osherway there under the altar there
and there's a pilgrimage as you know to Santiago de Compostela to this very day
every year and so i mean i would think that if there was an osherway if it had to
do with james it's sitting there in the church in Santiago de Compostela
it's not this osherway that someone concocted recently in palestine because it may have had
the name jacob on it what do you think about that chris well uh i'm not familiar with the
james the zebedee osherway that uh dr iceman speaking of but i did want to comment before
we get too far uh from what dr iceman was saying earlier all that family history and all that
passion was wonderful to hear and the the the idea of such passion uh i think is very illustrative
and is very helpful for your listeners to realize this is the kind of passion that the early
followers of jesus and associates of jesus would have had and they imagine when they see
romans in the holy land when they have that kind of passion for this land they're actually
mentioning jesus you don't have anything from him you don't know what he had what he said
what passion he had you have something from james but you don't have anything that you can
ascribe to jesus with any authenticity why do you talk about passion for jesus when there's
nothing that we can be sure of in terms of coming from him well i'm i'm i suppose i'm
speculating you're back to the gospel always over and over and over again even though you
don't want to be well sure the uh i was just thinking that there is so much passion involved uh in
nationalism uh when when i read the macabees and i read the kind of passion they have i get the sense
that the the group of jesus i had around him had that same kind of theme going for him i certainly
read it that uh that kind of passion the dead sea scroll and uh i can't hear uh yeah you have to
interpret it yeah i wish the mic would be clear so that dr iceman could hear it i would have loved to
have quoted uh passage from the scrolls that i think uh is from their righteous teacher but if
he can't hear it there's gonna be no point well we can uh if you if we can give it a shot let me
let him know what you just said here because ultimately he's saying the zeal that you have
the passion for nationalism clearly invokes an ancient idea that's rooted in this very thing
we're talking about with the kumran sect that they were very nationalistic they were very zealous
about their land and their traditions and their and their god and and that these romans who were
in there invading their country so to speak and telling them here pay these taxes they wanted
freedom they wanted freedom from that and they were freedom fighters technically and so you have
that same zeal right so he was just saying that he the alexanders uh the successors of alexanders
oppression in palisthenics macabre's actually achieved uh freedom and a state for a certain
amount of time till the herodian romans crushed them and now they're reviving the macabrean spirit
in the scrolls and that's where the macabres are not the enemies of the scrolls it's the spirit of
the macabres are back in the scrolls and they're going to fight once again for their independent
state and now we fought again but we have gone through so much suffering on the way to this
final struggle therefore i say don't give up anything don't take a step backwards don't give
in you have suffered so much you have given so much for this fight it through to the end right
and that's exactly what we see if you don't mind uh mr isman give it a shot chris hopefully you can
hear you there's a quote he wants to quote uh where's this from chris uh it's from the hymn scroll
from cave one from the hymn scroll from cave one these quoting things to me yeah he just he's he's
trying to just carry a quote man yeah yeah he's enjoying the dialogue and he's not trying to
prove anything he's just wanting to discuss these should i quote yes sir let him i just i just wanted
who who you think who wrote the hymn scroll uh dr isman in your opinion who wrote the hymn scroll
yes i don't know who wrote any of the scrolls per se i know the kind of people who wrote them
that's what i mean what's extremely i just told you i described who they were they were this
extremely zealots righteous passionate uh uh uh uh fighters for freedom righteousness and the
restoration of freedom of the kingdom of the jewish people not even kingdom of the of the of
the living space the the sovereignty of the jewish people and the rabbinic jews were not
too much interested in that so the jews that survived were the ones who were willing to do
the compromising but now we've returned to the other con and the scrolls come to light just
when we've turned to the other kind and therefore i think that the scroll ideology is a good motivator
i don't think it's modern enough to be acceptable to most people but it's a good motivating uh uh
as chris is picking up on a good motivating uh uh uh push towards this um messianism if you want to
call them i've heard the quote before um and it does sound very messianic uh which one give me the
quote yeah quote go ahead and try and quote it chris all right here we go they said of the vision
of knowledge it is not certain can you hear me so far yeah yeah okay and of the path of your heart
it is not that but you oh god will answer them judging them with your power according to their
idols and their numerous sins so that in their schemes are caught those who deviate from your
covenant at the judgment you will annihilate all the men of deception there will be no longer exist
series of delusion for they do not value me even though you exhibit your power in me and reveal
yourself in me with your strength to enlighten them you have not covered in disgrace the face of all
those looking for me those who unite together for your covenant those who walk on the path of your
heart have listened to me they have lying themselves with you in the council of the holy ones through
me you have enlightened the face well chris likes quotations he likes quotations from the scrolls
and so on he's a greater believer in the dead sea scrolls than i am in terms of its ideology
you know but okay those are inspirational passages they don't they're nothing to do with
history per se they show the spirit the spirit of the materials and that spirit as i've been saying
runs all through the scrolls but he's taking literally word for word for word and i'm not
interested in something that's 2000 or 2500 years old whatever it is literally taking it literally
literally i'm interested in new literature i'm interested in a new voice that speaks to the
modern jewish people in a manner that they can understand can be inspired like that but that
isn't going to speak to the average person in a manner that they can understand it's very inspirational
but it's not going to help anything i just wonder who that person is he's certainly megalomaniacal
he thinks he has a very major role i don't know i don't know who wrote these different scrolls well
it sounds to me like the righteous teacher or the overseer of the sack and it's he says that
that he the person who's writing that is saying that they were looking for these people were looking
for him and these are covenant people and they were listening to him and that there were many of
uh and that he's he's uh in opposition to seers of delusion and men of deception uh that you're
looking to unravel the puzzle of the scrolls yes i'm not looking to unravel the puzzle of the scrolls
in its in its actual itemization i take the general spirit of the scrolls and inspiration of the
scrolls and move forward i don't want to know i'm trying to wrap the puzzle whether jacob and whether
jacob and jacob or joshua ben uh zedekaya or someone like that wrote this particular piece
i want to know what's the moving what is the moving spirit spirit that can move us today
and help us move forward to restore ourselves and restore our land well hey brothers i really
appreciate you guys joining me we are at our one hour and ten minute mark approximately and i just
wanted to conclude here everybody who's watching this you guys can see that uh there's a first
century relevance to these texts that is the point they're trying to make get the book if you're
wanting to really see some proof definitely check out robert eisman professor eisman's book uh james
the brother of jesus where he not only makes a case for james existence he says well whoever james is
it's a good chance you're going to find out who jesus was so you definitely got to get the book
and he has a lot of other stuff about the dead sea scrolls you want to check out
he's forgotten more than he knew and uh more than i'll ever learn so i really appreciate that and
christopher lawson also has his book you guys can get pdf format just shoot me an email it'll
be down in the description if you guys want to give a donation you're more than happy to and
i could send you he has three or four pdfs one of the main ones is reconstructing jesus
what if the historical jesus was the heir to the throne a reconstruction based on the first century
dead sea scrolls i appreciate you guys joining me on the show do you have any closing statements
you'd like to make professor eisman and chris well i don't know what the heir to the throne could
possibly be anyway so i can't comment on that um and particularly for the present day uh as far as
uh as um as far as um my latest book i wrote about um the um freeing of the dead sea scrolls i just
finished that last year and that's out for people they can they can they can they can read the whole
story of how we freed the dead sea scrolls the dead sea scrolls were under the control of this
establishment group of scholars and uh including all christian ones and very few jewish ones are
certainly no jewish um nationalist ones and um you know one had to one couldn't seal all all all
all of the scrolls they just released a certain number there was a professor in in oxford vermesh
his name was who thought he was jewish but he wasn't even jewish and uh his ideas are like
amazingly uh you know way out of context and all of these people are considered experts
so when you uh free the dead sea scrolls you not only free all the fragments so everybody can
look at and we did then publish all the fragments in a complete two volume version uh because i got
a hold of all of the fragments because i knew the person who was photographing them up at the
huntington library and i got a hold of all of the fragments and james robinson who's now passed away
and i published them so we published all the fragments and in doing so we want to also free them
from the control of this mindset that i've been referring to throughout this discussion
that still exists as you see it exists in this scholarly framework and to some extent
criticism is free of it but on the other hand he's part of this mindset in the sense that he
takes some of its parameters uh for granted and i don't take any of that for granted i move forward
from where we are now and the inspiration of righteousness passion nationalism and a jewish
territory for jews to be what they are is my main goal and i'll close with saying thank you dr
iceman for all you've done in the work for scroll research and in the interpretation of it uh i think
there is no uh scholar a scroll studies uh that could do their work and call it complete if they
haven't taken your work into account and i say thank you for getting the scrolls to be free all your
work at huntington library and all the abuse you took from her shall shanks and associates from
biblical archaeology review and you took it in stride uh i say you're the man of the hour you're
the man of our century and that they had some sort of metal for it and i was in charge of assigning
it uh you would be getting one so thank you dr well give it to my great grandfather too thanks a lot
me and spartan myth vision podcast derek lambert thank you for joining me we'll see you next time
