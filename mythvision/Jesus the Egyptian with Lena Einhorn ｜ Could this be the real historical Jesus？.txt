Jesus the Egyptian please do not miss this episode make sure you guys watch
it through because I want to hear your opinions and thoughts at the end I will
be looking through the comment section.
Lena Einhorn takes us through a couple of her books that she discusses some
interesting topics we cover everything from who is Jesus really according to
the historical record. Josephus and the shift in time and how the Gospel narratives
don't match she has graphs we're going to do further shows where she goes
through presentations I love this lady she is wonderful please go down in the
description check out her books in the Amazon link make sure you guys get it a
shift in time and the Jesus mystery this woman is brilliant so I hope you guys
subscribe to the channel like this this is truly fascinating what she brings to
the table I've never heard anything like this pertaining to Jesus and looking at
the errors in the New Testament.
we are myth vision welcome back ladies and gentlemen your host Derek Lambert
today we have a shift in time with Lena Einhorn how you doing well thank you I'm
glad you came to join me some of my audience has mentioned you and I try to
be a good host the best I can yes ma'am so I read I read some of that paper that
you sent me and I'm currently going through a different book that you have
of course but on audible because I have a hard time sitting and reading I can
listen better than I can sit and read this new generation of us you know the
way we are however wash the dishes yes yes I am actually astounded at what
you've what you've done and simplified something that was very interesting to
me that the historical Jesus is missing from history now we start with that
idea that the Gospels we aren't really counting you know when something's that
fictitious and so much I don't want to use that in a derogatory sense but so
much allegory so much parabolic language it's metaphorical it's it seems like
it's not literal history when we can't find this guy what are we doing you know
how are we gonna figure this out and you go to Josephus and you go to other
historians so I want you to introduce yourself of course to the audience but
also tell them what you get let's get into the discussion of what this is all
about oh this is hmm there are several points in time when it comes to this
hypothesis it really started many many years ago and I'm not gonna go into the
beginning because it sort of evolved let me instead say that even if it wasn't
the impetus that the the reasoning behind the hypothesis is really the thing
that everybody is basing their hypothesis or non hypothesis about Jesus
namely that you cannot find him outside of the New Testament in real time you
know during the first century if you accept Testimonium Flavianum which
is a paragraph in Jewish antiquities by Josephus which almost everybody says
is it is to some extent a falsification or is it is some you know people vary as
to how much different it is from what what is the original but at least it's
not your it wasn't originally there as it's written outside of that you really
don't find Jesus in the first century historical texts outside of the outside
of the gospel texts the New Testament texts and so you know so there are two
main hypotheses one is okay he was sort of one of the many messianic claimants
and and you know and that was a tumultuous century and he's just buried in
there with the rest which is sort of the majority view among scholars and then
there's a minority view which basically says no he never existed at all it's all
fiction now now on that note I I just like to plug so we have good dialogue
this is gonna be an introductory show because I honestly think a series you
can do a series on the show because I was blown away on your paperwork focusing
on that I would like to ask you to please name some of your books for our
audience some people are not familiar with some of your works that you have
written on these things I'll have them down in the description so that they can
click the Amazon link and get a hold of them what are some of your books you've
written well I'm basically I mean my background is is not as as a biblical
scholar at all I'm I'm an MD PhD by training but many years ago I shifted to
doing documentary filming and I'm presently mostly working as an author I
have two books that are published on the historical Jesus and they both deal
with the timeshift both of them know the first one was written originally in
Swedish it came out in 2006 it was in Swedish you know the translated title
was what happened on the road to Damascus in English it became the Jesus
mystery with a lengthy subtitle that I don't remember but it was called the
Jesus mystery now after that was published and in English it came out in
2007 for a number of years I went to the Society of Biblical Literature
conferences and they accepted my abstracts and I was allowed to present so
I I did maybe five or six presentations over a few years at the Society of
Biblical Literature international annual meetings of this hypothesis and and
there was something happened it was really really interesting what happened
and when I was in the seminar room and I presented it as a PowerPoint
presentation it was like it was completely quiet everybody followed me
everybody knew what I was doing the questions that came afterwards were
incredibly relevant everybody was with me always somebody would come up to me
and said why hasn't this been published in a journal I'll help you do it or you
should contact this person or whatever and then when the seminar was over and
the door closed it was as if it never happened and this repeated itself over
and over again and when I contacted you know there were quite a few people at
each that there were these were a number of seminars when I if I contacted them
afterwards it was like it was very it was very fascinating and it wasn't
disturbing as much as it was and it was interesting and it was a confirmation of
how people's minds work when we encounter things that make sense but don't fit
with our preconceived notions or our ideas of what truth is and it's just
very interesting and it and it's certainly true in science as well and
perhaps more than anything in in biblical science because it's connected to
faith and in any event so I kept having these presentations and in the end I
decided no I'll publish a second book where I assemble more of the data I
have because the first book the Jesus mystery as it's called in English is
more of a it's it's more of a literary piece and I decided okay I'll make it
written in a popular way but I'll put in all the evidence that I'm presenting in
this scholarly context and that became a shift in time and that was published in
2016 you actually sent me that the article on this right this is right that's
the article that that that came out of the presentations at the at the society
of biblical literature I want to talk about that I mean let's let's go into
some meat if you don't mind because sure first of all for our audience who
hasn't read this you really should get the book I was astounded I love it
because that's what we entertain on the show we're big on finding out like who
is Jesus was he a rebel leader was he just a faith healer you know trying to
figure out who the guy was which you you do a good job in this in this article
and then in the book I'm certain this is the condensed version so to speak
Jesus first of all he doesn't fit in the 30s he doesn't fit in this window and
you do a good job by going to these other people like the book of Acts talks
about the Egyptian the book of Acts talks about Judah the Galilean okay or
Judas however you want to pronounce his name these these actual people who
existed in history in Josephus you find these guys and you're like following
their their their cookie crumbs you know you're saying okay here they are and
you're using details of the robbers you mention a term robbers that is utilized
in the New Testament and in Josephus and you do this fascinating thing where you
go where's it at and there's charts these charts are showing before the 30s like
in the beginning you know very first century beginnings you have all these
activities in these terms being used in Josephus talking about historical stuff
then you have after that in the 50s and 60s and it's like where's it going on
under the Pontius Pilate situation exactly what does that do to the extra
biblical historical context of stuff from Tacitus and Suetonius how does that
affect the Crestus who's being killed in the 30s supposedly if Josephus isn't
even really going hey guys look it's right here I don't understand but I mean
what you're talking about is evidence from the second century it's you know
you're not talking about I mean Josephus is the only person who is writing at the
same time as the Gospel authors mainly he is he is really and not only is he
writing at the same time but he is the I mean any other source looking at this
period and looking at this geographical place is is minuscule compared to
Josephus he really covered it and and what is so fascinating when you and
that's why everybody is comparing a New Testament with Josephus because that's
the source and all they find is testimonial Flaviano which you know is
sort of not wasn't there from the beginning I mean we don't have to go
into all the evidence there it's plenty of evidence right in any event so the
thing when I started writing the first book I was doing it because of another
hypothesis I was exploring and I decided that I was just gonna do this
comparison I was just gonna start from the beginning I was just gonna do what
everybody else was doing and then these weirds this weird stuff kept popping up
you know it's like it wasn't only that Jesus wasn't there or his disciples or
Christianity wasn't there in Josephus but the people the famous people from the
New Testament you know all the dignitaries and the high priests and
the and the and this and the emperors and the procurators and prefects you know
the names were there in Josephus but hey they weren't doing the stuff that that
is described in the New Testament it was like nothing fit it wasn't only that
that Jesus wasn't there but it was like these you know like there were no two
high priests and Caiaphas and Annas they weren't high priests together I mean
they were separated by three high priests they never ruled together I mean
there were lots of these things I mean that pilot was killing Galileans I mean
pilot wasn't even ruling galley all these loads and loads of things that
weren't fitting with the dignitaries but the funny thing was that there were
things that fitted with the dignitaries but 20 years later and and you know it
was like this thing when it for me the interesting thing is that when I started
writing the book I came two-thirds through the book until we say in
Swedish that the coin drops well I guess maybe it suddenly was a late night
basically what happened was there were all these chronological things that were
not correct in in the 30s they weren't there I mean robbers there were no
robbers in the 30s there isn't a single robber mentioned by by Josephus between
six the year six in the year 44 none but they are very much present before and
they're very much present after no crucifixions between between four and
46 no crucifixion but before yes and and afterwards yes there were loads of
things that you know just wasn't there when there was supposed to be there and
then there was this guy the Egyptian it sounded an awful lot like Jesus he
spent time in the wilderness just like Jesus it was called the Egyptian there
was an Egyptian connection to Jesus he gathered his disciples where on the
Mount of Olives which is where Jesus gathered his disciples he preached to
his disciples that he was gonna tear down the walls of Jerusalem very similar
to what Jesus was preaching that he was perceived the Egyptian and if and the
interesting thing is that if you look at the 30s there isn't a single messianic
claimant or a single leader religious leader mentioned at that period but the
Egyptian is one of those that is mentioned as one of the major leaders
in both Jewish antiquities and war of the Jews Jewish war so he's a big one but
he was in the 50s he was not in the 30s and then there were a few things that
didn't fit there were many things that did fit but there were a couple of things
that didn't fit first of all the Egyptian was not crucified what is said
is that just like Jesus he was defeated or whatever you want to call it on the
Mount of Olives exactly the same spot and he was perceived as a threat by the
authorities the big difference is that whereas Jesus was resting and with his
disciples and then he was arrested resting and arrested by the Sanhedrin the
Jewish Council the people sent out but the Jewish Council this is not what
happened with the Egyptian what happened with the Egyptian was that the
procurator who wasn't pilot at that time it was Felix he sent out Roman soldiers
a cohort of Roman soldiers to fight against the Egyptian and all his
disciples up on the Mount of Olives and it was a big battle and a lot of people
were killed this is what Josephus described and then he says but the
Egyptian escaped out of the fight and he was not heard from again now I kept
putting in I just in those first chapters of the book because I was making
this I was writing as I was being perplexed so I kept putting in this
the Egyptian it's awfully weird how similar he is to Jesus but hey it's in
the 50s it's not it's not and then late one night it's really late at night I am
sitting with the Greek I don't know Greek but I sit with the sort of parallel
Greek translation of John of the description of the Gospel John of how
Jesus is arrested and there's a difference between John and the Synoptic
Gospels in the description of the arrest because in the synoptic Gospels you
know the Sanhedrin the Jewish Council the men come up in the arrest Jesus in John
it says that the men from the Jewish Council is accompanied by the Speira
and the Heliarchos now in the translations all the Swedish translations
English translations it's like the captain and the guard but that's not what
it means a Speira is a Roman cohort of 1000 soldiers and the Heliarchos means a
leader of 1000 the Roman soldiers that according to John not according to
you see this was sent up to arrest Jesus were a thousand men okay that is a
battle that's not the resting resting man that is a battle and the interesting
thing about the New Testament is that it's written there too but it's it's as
subtext it's written in subtext and there are hits once you sort of make the
connection you see it you see in Luke that Jesus tells his disciples to bring
swords up to the Mount of Olives and you see that someone is cutting the ear of
that you know you you you you have the signals there but you don't you sort of
gloss over them until you get the full picture and it's like it's like an
autostereogram I don't know if you call it that in English like when you when you
read the text of the New Testament all you see is the surface and then you see
all these weird little things like the the names of these of these rebel leaders
thrown into the text and you don't understand why and you just gloss over
it one of them is the Egyptian is in the New Testament it's an act and you see
Judas the Galilean and you see theaters and they're all thrown into it you see
that that the birth of Jesus is during the tax census under Carinius and you
know what was born under the tax at the tax census under Carinius the Jewish
rebel movement that's when it was born so so so so what you see is you see all
you see the New Testament is written in layers okay and I'm now writing a book
I'm almost finished I'm almost done with it it's coming out this fall it's in
Swedish so far and it's about the Old Testament the interesting thing that I
find is that and I want to say this because it's it's important I think you
know and it has to do also with the whole idea of mythicism etc now when you
don't find something you either say well you know it's so long ago we don't have
the evidence or you say it's all invented it's all fiction but what I really I
really believe now after having worked on both in you and the Old Testament is
that the people who wrote these texts they had to satisfy two needs one was a
religious need to congregate people around you know a vision of God and you
know prophets whatever they had to have a story that fitted the movement and the
religion but they had another need to and that was to tell history they wanted
to tell history and so they had to in order to and these two needs they didn't
gel often because history wasn't always fitting into the needs of the religion
it sometimes it didn't fit at all and so then what they would do is they would
tell the story on the surface and then they would under the surface they would
tell the other story and the only reason you could see the other story that I
felt that I could see the other story in the New Testament was because I put
you see for some top of it and I shifted but I had to shift it and when I looked
through the prism of Jusifus at the New Testament the whole story you know it
sort of came up from below if you understand what I'm saying and suddenly
you know when John then says that there is a thousand soldiers and the commander
coming up to the Mount of Olives it's not crap it means something.
You know something interesting looking at that passage just because I can remember
I don't have the passage right in front of me but you know it's like he turns and I think he says
something or something I can't remember and they all fall like they're dead which is just a funny
fictional there's something there as to why they're saying that these Romans just they just fall
like they're dead at the feet of Jesus but then they get back up and then they rest him and he
almost seems like he's in total control of the situation how they how they fictionalize it here
and John I think it's beautiful what you're doing I don't think your your motives are at all bad I
think your motives are driven in the right direction really trying to figure it out I mean who who
hasn't watched mystery videos and movies and thought what if I can find the Ark of the Covenant you
know and this is a different type of Ark of the Covenant if you will figuring out the enigma
of the New Testament let's let's discuss something not only the New Testament I mean I really think
this is you know history is a new thing it eroticist was 400 BC you know there was no history before
then no no epic history but there was there were these religious tales thousands of years of religious
tales and they had history too and I really really believe that you don't make up the stories for
for no reason they aren't made up but they had to be fitted with the religious tale
and that made an adjustment necessary as far as and I guess I want to jump and ask you just
point blank why not um do you well two point question do you believe that there was an actual
historical Jesus if so who was he all right which is which is part of that let's just start there
let's just start there yes I do believe there was a historical Jesus I believe he was the Egyptian
but not only the Egyptian but for for now let's speak with you that's what see see this is the
issue that I have Lena and look I totally agree with you in fact I've coined a phrase
histo-mythesist okay no but I'm not gonna you know what I if you're gonna say that it's a it's a
count it's a what would it go they use more than one no no you think it's primarily one okay I really
do think he is the Egyptian okay but I think that the New Testament in its incredibly clever way
it's not that there are several people who are Jesus it is that the Egyptian is several people in
the New Testament all right all right so I like that difference primarily it is the Egyptian now
it's the Egyptian it is the no it's I would say it's 100% the Egyptian and they just added some
things on to him but but Jesus but there are several people in the New Testament who's a
Barabbas is also Jesus you know what Barabbas means son of the father yeah and his name in Matthew
is Jesus Barabbas okay so the guy the rebel leader Barabbas who's a robber and escapes
out of the situation his name is Jesus son of the father
this is out of the fight just like the Egyptian but but you know this is what I'm telling you
this is what I feel that the the truth is there in the New Testament too so if if if if the Egyptian
wasn't crucified then there is someone in the New Testament who wasn't crucified as well because the
whole history is there interesting way of looking at I never would have thought about it like this so
so let me ask you I guess getting to the next obvious question I have since this is about the
shift in time I'm not going to title it that I want more people to see this I want as many
possible people who are watching this show to click this button and listen to what you just said
here here's one of the things I want to ask you do you think they purposely and for theological
new numerological religious purposes placed it in the 30s so that it was exactly one generation
away from the temple's destruction that 40 year gap into the 30s under pilot so that there's that
40 years like in the wilderness with Moses idea being repeated here I I don't know I haven't thought
about that and and I'm not sure I can tell you why I think they moved it from the 50s I'm I cannot
say for sure why they moved it to the 30s my my reasoning behind well first of all why did they
move it because they didn't want a competition and and and Josephus was publishing and and he was a
famous guy in those days and he wasn't the only one justice from of Tiberias was also publishing
although his his writings are lost but you know there were competing narratives of the same period
and of the same people that is my explanation why they would move it so that there would not be
competing narratives now why they moved it to the 30s maybe another reason they could have moved it
to the 30s is because there was no there there on the 30s there was no there were no robbers there
were no other messianic leaders there was there were nothing in history that that could you know
it was empty so to speak not empty I mean but but a lot of the stuff that that is present in them
in the 50s and then much more as you approach the jewish war and that are elements of the
new testament text like crucifixions and robbers and things like that they're not there in the 30s
and so it's an empty period it's a it's a hole that you could fill that was my interpretation
I mean there could be other you know interpretations of that there was a symbolic meaning to the 30s
I don't know you know I don't I this isn't finished I mean every time I look at josephus
I see another link to this I haven't I haven't seen it all you know I mean there are lots of
stuff there you you every time I mean I'm sure that every line in the new testament means
something every word is there for a reason nothing is just thrown in there for no reason
but you can it's not always easy to find it because it's so cleverly put put there and not
everything is 20 years later the main story is 20 years later but you find the jewish war in there
too there are there are there are parallels to the jewish war in in and I have in in both in the
book you shift in time and in the paper a lengthy parallel between acts and the story of Peter and
when they're when they're preaching the temple after the crucifixion and and something that's
happening at the beginning of the jewish war with manahem who was a rebel leader and you put
them next to each other and it's it's not one parallel it's not two parallel it's not three
parallels it's like 30 parallels or at least 25 it's it's so convincing that this is you know
it's statistically very strong that these are two parallel narratives but it's not that's not 20
years later that's the jewish war and so every time every time I look at it I I I see a new thing
and what I really think is the consistent story historical narrative of the new testament
is the story of the jewish rebellion against Rome and the egyptian is fit at a particular
time there which is in the 50s that's the time of the egyptian but there is other stuff in there I
mean as I said they throw in theaters and and and just take theaters I mean theaters is really
interesting because once you see that there's a parallel between the egyptian and jesus and you
say oh okay who's the guy that came before the egyptian well the last messianic leader that
that jucefus mentions before the egyptian is theaters okay now who is theaters well theaters
was this messianic leader rebel leader who gathered people where by the jordan river but the
the authorities which is the it's not herald and pass in this case it's it's fados who's a
who's a roman procurator they he doesn't like him so he sends out all these soldiers and what do they
do with theaters they cut off his head and they carry it to Jerusalem I mean this is oh guys this
is great this is great I love this so this all of it like you said it fits this puzzle and and
theaters I mean all these details makes me ask because I'm sure you go to Judah we might as well
go to Judas the Galilean too while we're here and have you discussed that before I get to a point I
think where I'd like to ask some other questions but just what else is theaters because this is
John the Baptist obviously pictured here beheaded by Herod the great correct if I'm not mistaken
no no heradan pass in the in the in the gospels but right but but fadas in in josephus I didn't mean
the great sorry but so totally different people exactly but that's the whole thing so how do you
shift something in time how do you do that there's only one way to do that because we didn't
at though in those at at that time you didn't have you know bce or or ce or whatever you want to call
it you had dignitaries that's how you had time how you fixed time it's the x year of tiberias's
rain it's uh you know that's how you fixed time and so the only way to present a time is by presenting
a dignitary and the year of his usually rain that's the only way to present time so how do
you shift time you shift dignitaries do you think that josephus or whoever obviously josephus who
wrote this and his cohort his his group said we're monopolizing this time so if you're going to
write anything you're going to have to place it in another time do you think that's what happened
or do you think further it's not no I mean listen the year 70 is the big catastrophe of the Jewish
realm okay it's it's Jerusalem is destroyed people are dispersed few people remain fighting on
masada for another three years it's the end it's the end of history there you could write a story
and nobody would know if it was true or not because everybody's either dead or gone and especially
since the gospels were written you know outside they were they were written after the Jewish war
and and and they were written you know presumably in Greek and they were written for another audience
somewhere else okay so you could have gotten away with writing anything but there were other
historians and there were other historians who were outside and who survived and who wrote the
history of that period and the most famous one is josephus the surviving one is josephus we know
over the least one more just as of tidbirius and there could have been others but josephus
he was a friend of Titus I mean this was a major player you know he had a statue in Rome he has
books in in in the libraries this is what not nobody he was the the historian of of the people
that people expected would not exist anymore that was his I mean he's a very interesting guy josephus
he was he was a commander in the war against the romans and he switched sides you know he
was a survivor you could call it but he had and he became a friend of the romans he became part of
the of the court but he had this thing I'm I have to save for posterity the history of my people
and so he wrote the an enormous body of work especially about the first century but not only
but especially about the first century and you know and it's very detailed and what's interesting
is there are a lot of people who are writing about whether luke read josephus I think he did
because there are many phrases and and ways of reasoning that are similar in any event
if he didn't read josephus then the people who were putting together later the gospels and and
the other writings into the new testament for sure knew about josephus there was an
alternate alternative narrative that was established um you if you write a religious story
rather than just a historical story I mean history is always skewed but it didn't have
josephus didn't have any religious sort of motivations let's put it that way so he he
just wanted to tell the truth be albeit perhaps skewed but that was the people who wrote both the
old testament and the new testament they had to consider the religious needs and so when
josephus who hated the messianic claimants who hated the rebels who called them all kinds of
nasty names and he did not like the egyptian I mean he called them a false prophet a charlatan
you know you don't want to compete with that narrative and so that is my hypothesis of why
they would shift it I don't know why they would shift it I'm I'm certain they did shift it because
if you if you look at this at the 30s you don't find anything that fits nothing I mean you may
find names but you don't find activities that fit and we're talking dignitaries we're not only
talking jesus here and if you shift it it suddenly all fits and and you gotta keep you have to keep
coming back to the show we've gotta have you keep I okay I I cannot be sure of why they shifted it
but my my my main interpretation is that they didn't want to have competing narratives got a
question for you then Jesus okay let's let's go to an interesting part you have two passages that
usually are disputed over who you know Jesus is the testimony in flavinium which some scholars
we're not even going to go into that but they think there may be a core to it who cares if there is
at the end of the day it's been embellished it's become this Jesus character has now become the
version for the Catholics etc now the other James the brother of Jesus situation in Josephus
who do you think that jesus was is he anywhere in the new testament in your opinion that jesus and
which jesus the james and then james son of damian's like that's just like one line I mean that's
what I'm saying why would they only mention this why would joseph is not he goes in all this talk
about the you know I actually I actually you know so many people have done it before me but I
do in the book and I don't remember if I do it in the paper too just put up all the arguments why
this is these are interpolations and I and I and I claim that that the the one about john the
Baptist is as well because you know if thea does is john the Baptist and that's another person and
one of the things that's so clear is that the narrative would flow much better if they didn't
stick that paragraph in the middle and that's true of both of them you know it's like it's there's a
story if you've left out the paragraph the story sort of continues underneath or on each side of
the paragraph but that's not the only reason the argument there are lots of arguments why why this
is you know you you find you don't find it's an origin you find it and you see I mean there are
kinds of when it comes to to the testimonial flavian there are other arguments when it comes to the
john john the Baptist paragraph in any event it it's the only thing there is it's the only thing
there is why would they name this guy jesus question maybe his name was jesus I don't know
we only if he's the egyptian that's not a name
okay yeah and I just I just wanted your thoughts of maybe you know because they did john the
Baptist was deotus john you know what I mean so that's kind of why I'm like I don't know you know
I'm just using logic here and it doesn't really when we're looking at it like this I'm just I was
just going logically where that goes so I love this number one I want to say this my fans I'm certain of
enjoy this regardless of if they conclude where you're at with this but this how well I want to
stick to your works but I almost want to mention the the the guy the king of kings when it comes to
historicity Bart Ehrman what's he think of the egyptian have you ever dialogue with him no I think
yeah if I remember this is years back I I think I wrote to him and either he didn't write me back
or he wrote me back very like I didn't have time to read sorry or something like that
yeah I know I wrote him and I know I didn't get into a dialogue I don't remember if he did answer me
or if he just asked if he didn't answer me or if he just answered me very I don't have time I think
it was I don't have time to read it you you said that Josephus was saying that the egyptian was a
charlatan and these people two questions I hate doing two questions but I know that I'll miss them
because once you get dialogue going it's tough to keep up number one wasn't supposedly Josephus a
rebel himself supposedly um and then number two the egyptian does that also line up with the magic
jesus kind of ideas that this guy could have been more than just some hardcore tour orthodox guy he
could have probably probably been like a healer type of the whole thing about Egypt if we should
remember the josephus question okay and we'll take the because the thing about
Egypt we haven't talked about it yet but um there are about four arguments and I line them up why
jesus not only went to Egypt as a child and returned as a child but that they actually
returned as an adult just like the egyptian um the first argument um now I don't want to rank them
but one of the arguments say let's say is is the um very comparatively early you could call it
anti christian description uh that you find with it where there's a lot of description of jesus
which is very early it's it's alithus logos uh by celsus that came around 175 and the only reason
we have it is that origin wrote a book called contra celsum which was against celsus but he
quotes celsus there and celsus at length he quotes him so origin the church father
writes a book to refute celsus and in this book which is um you know wherever he got that
information he claims that jesus um was came from a very poor single mother and he went to egypt
you know as a young man and he came back having learned magic skills and this is what celsus writes
he came back as an adult obviously not as a as a child that's that's that's one two is that
the talmud uh in in in in talmud you do find descriptions which are in general interpreted
to be and which were very controversial in the middle ages and they had to strike them out etc
are considered references to jesus uh and he's there called ben stada or ben pantera he has several
names but celsus says actually that jesus was the son of a soldier by the name of pantera so
so he's there called ben pantera and ben pantera also comes from egypt and has learned magic skills
um comes back third argument is that in in um sort of the middle ages and there are several
quotes of this christian authors wrote that the jews called jesus the egyptian or the egyptian
destroyer or that his father was called the egyptian and these this is what christian authors
write that the jews say about jesus okay so that's another to call him the egyptian
that's another argument another argument uh is that when jesus comes to nazareth
you know and he's around 30 years old and nobody recognizes him at first where has he been
and then when they start recognizing him they connect him to his family to his siblings it's
like oh it's that guy that we saw so i mean where has he been all those years but the most important
argument i i've listened i love this last one is is the most important one and that is in matthew
where it says now i don't remember the exact wording
but it says in the gospel of matthew right after jesus comes back as a child with his parents
from egypt it says at that time john the baptist started preaching in the wilderness
now john the baptist is six months older than jesus what is he doing preaching as a child
and and it's not the only thing you find you find there but but you you he starts preaching in the
is it the 15th year of the reign of tiberius now that's a very long time after the death of herod the
great which is when jesus was supposed to to return that's about 23 years later so so it seems
that also there you find you have the indication that when jesus did return from egypt he was not
a child he was an adult and so this also fits with this whole concept the there came out of egypt
it says when josephus says there came out of egypt the man that said he was a prophet this is how
he starts describing the egyptian and he came and and he and he went to the mount of alms and he
started preaching to the masses that he was going to tear down the walls of jesus you've done a very
good job on on this show letting me get a good picture of this person i i i have a fundamental
question that i think is at the root of everyone watching this all of this makes perfect sense it
really does one thing i'd like to ask is who is writing this about him and are they writing about
this this jesus character okay yes it's it's religious history so to speak it's more religious in my
opinion than it is actual history but they're trying to combine which i've always thought there's
something there my question would be this are these people who wrote these new testament books do you
think and i know this is a hunch i can only ask you what you think because everyone has a motivation
question oh they wrote it too trick or or like we have people who come on the show who'd say the
romans wrote it or we have some that come on and say look these were probably jewish people who were
part of mystery um mystery cults that wrote these things do who do you think these people were and
why did they write them about this person unless they maybe and they made him look good they didn't
make him look bad they made him look like he was cool with rome even though rome's the one coming
to kill them it's just very complex is it not i i think it was his disciples that started writing it
and you have to also ask yourself did he die on the cross or not if he didn't what happened then
and uh and that is my guess um it's interesting when you come to to luke in acts that somebody
is luke if you want to call him that is writing for someone or someone seems to have been dictating
to them dear theophilus i mean it seems like this is a story that's told um now who told it
that this is so awesome though because something just comes up to me i have to say like you brought
up the whole point of the crucifixion this guy escapes okay they got the crucifixion and this
supposed man named paul this is my problem this is my problem and and i think everyone watching
this is with me at least to some extent that that that actually follows what where i'm coming from
this is a journey i'm on lina at miss high einhorn um i just don't want to be disrespectful but
why is paul 20 years after the 30 supposedly doing this thing and saying this is the guy he was
crucifix or whether or not you know there's that dispute among whether he even knew a guy because
he says i got it from scripture i got it from this there's a crucified jesus right and he's supposed
to be right here how's paul i just don't see how paul wrote in the fifties these scholars who say
these are seven authentic but listen if it if everything happened in the fifties then the the
gap in time is is very very small so but he believes in a crucified jesus or is that interpolation
listen i mean we might as well i don't know how far you got into the jesus mystery but i do have
the hypothesis presented there and i'm not claiming it's true i'm throwing out the hypothesis
that jesus and paul is the same person okay okay so i guess i'm getting into where they just need
to get the book to figure this out i i'm not addressing it i'm not addressing it in the
second book a shift in time because it sort of clouds over everything and this is how i started
the whole thing i can tell you this how it all started it started many years ago
by someone saying you know jesus didn't die on the cross and i you know it was like this oh
and then everything fell into place you know you know and it went okay so what it would you know it
all took a split second no okay he he survived he he uh that was so it was so the the romans didn't
or pilot didn't want to crucify him it uh it was such a complex story he he lives he dies
he lives again he dies again but it it all it you know it was split second oh you know
and then i thought okay what happened then where did he go if he's you know even if he
survived in the way that that that the gospels tell it you know if he was resurrected whatever
where did he go what happened and and the name paul entered my and that's why i started this whole
exploration now i didn't have a clue then that i was going to run into this time shift or that i
was going to find anything with josephus i was just exploring this and i did i i did and i still
throw out and i put in the first book the arguments for and against the jesus and paul could have been
the same person i don't claim with anything you know sounding like certainty that this is the case
but i throw it i threw out the possibility and i argue for it i argue against it the time shift
i feel much more on solid ground because there's so much evidence but they don't the two things don't
go against each other and you know there is one line in the gospel in the acts that basically
you know it's written in two it's written in in layers it's beautiful this book the
testament it's amazing if you look at i think it's acts 21 38
um paul comes back to jerusalem and he's been there before and he's always hiding
for some reason and the explanation is different but this time he goes to the temple
and it says in acts that he's recognized and people want to kill him and there's a big tumult
and the roman commander comes and rescues him and takes him out
and before he does he says who is this guy he asks this is all in acts who is this guy
he asks of the uh of the people in the temple and it says all these names were thrown out
but there was such a tumult he couldn't get a clear picture i'm not quoting verbatim but
basically that's what it said then he takes him out
and then jesus says to the commander can i ask you a question and the commander says
oh you speak greek then you are not the egyptian went out into the wilderness with four thousand
sycarii interesting how did i miss this it's the only time the egyptian is mentioned in
the new testament the only time
this is okay we got to speculate here everything's speculative but if but you know he's he's
saying it to paul and paul was definitely and what do you have any just asking you i'm not
i want our audience who may not agree with this idea okay to try to have mercy and understand
we're just you know playing with pieces exploring okay and this is nothing and i want to say it again
i don't think the the idea of jesus being paul is in any way proven but if there is
one point in the new testament where it's sort of actually with the finger points that way it's
that line but you know i i'm not i'm not claiming anything with regards to that i i think we all
get that and and you know i'm with you like i don't want stones to be thrown um i do want you
know i like exploration though and i don't want you to feel like you can't say something because
oh what are people gonna think i don't care i have i have guys like joseph no i mean and the
reason the reason i didn't even bring that up in the second book the shift in time is because it's
clouds everything and it's not and and the and the time shift is so solid that i i wanted to
stand on its own merits and not be clouded by this big issue let's put it that way oh Jesus
oh we can't listen to her now right no it's not only that it's not it's not that they can't listen
to me but that it because it takes over you know uh it's it's it's it has but
bottom line bottom line is i do think i am not a mythicist i do think jesus existed
i do think he was uh very similar in many ways or i think he's he is described in the new testament
as he was but he was a rebel and the and the sort of the rebel part of him is under the surface
it's it's sort of in little like why why should they bring swords to the mount of olives i mean
it comes in little spurts it's not very obvious but in principle i believe the new testament is
a historical text do you think he was well two questions something in pairs keeps coming to me
so first question i'd like to ask without going back to the gospels too far is sol becoming paul
does that have any significance to your theory when we're exploring and the second question would be
when we look at the new testament and we see jesus talking to samaritans i'm sure that's significant
because you bring up in the historical chasm or the shift in time so to speak there's not
really any issues between jews and samaritans anywhere in the time the new testament puts it
it's before and it's after that any well it's it's there's a war there's a galley and samaritan
war between 48 and 52 and you cannot say or one cannot say that you know they're completely at
peace with each other but but jucephus does not mention any animosity outside of those 48 to 52
and the interesting thing is that the new testament also has a specific period of animosity and that
is in the gospel times whereas when you look in acts the the samaritans are mentioned a number of
times and there's no hint of animosity so you do have a period of animosity in the gospels and you
do have a period of animosity in jucephus but they're 20 years apart okay uh jesus uh okay we did the
what about uh paul being saul saul being paul is there anything there i don't know and
listen and
now i'm really out speculating welcome to myth vision podcast let's say
that that uh jesus in the time when he was in in uh judia and galley was a rebel leader
let's say he escaped now there are two periods and something brought out the peace loving
the jesus as we know him and i it may have happened in that particular shift between
before and after the crucifixion or whatever you want to the end the end time there it became
a religion that was preaching you know um it had a more peaceful message than what was happening
during the extremely you know this was an extremely uh it was an apocalyptic time
the first century i mean it was the end of the world as they knew it it was very violent
there was it was a time of of survival it was a time of messianism
um it was uh it was rebellion was what the time was all rebellion and and and messianism and the
end of times was what the the first century was in history in reality um that was not
that was not the message that paul was preaching
strange yeah that is strange you asked me something else before and that's about
jusephus if he was a rebel yes jusephus was an aristocrat jusephus was the opposite of the
rebels the rebels were like peasants they were to large extent galleons i thought he was in
prison though i thought he got captured in a war supposedly that's yes it's because what happens
when you approach the jewish war that everybody becomes a rebel or rather everybody becomes a
fighter it's like the aristocracy and the leadership and the and the rabbis they were they didn't
want to fight with the romans the rebels wanted and there was this tension and and it got worse
and worse you know got some really awful roman procurators and in the end you couldn't stop it
and once you couldn't stop it people like jusephus joined the fight and because he was such a
prominent person he was an aristocrat he had been he'd been living in roman in in in he was he was
the the uh emperors and nero's wife's close confidant i mean he was living in he you know he
was not your typical rebel but he became a commander in the jewish war he became one of the two competing
commanders in the galley um and and so he's not a rebel but he he becomes a fighter in the jewish
war and he hated he hated the rebels that's why his history his depiction it may be skewed
too much the other direction and he painted them in such black colors that it's not a pleasant
read you know he's he hates he hates the the the robbers so so that's why you know he say
they destroyed our country so he has a very very negative image very negative picture of of these
people so anybody who who wanted to put this messianic movements in a in a good light you
didn't want to be compared to jusephus's writings because he didn't like them
wow this was such a good show um i definitely want to put a hold on there and um we will
definitely go into some other interesting things on another podcast if you guys are watching this
ladies and gentlemen please do me a favor i want to bring her back go down in the description
make sure you guys get the book because ask questions if you have questions put them down
in the comment section and i make sure that when we do our next interview i'll pick out
some questions from you guys so that we can ask her and uh you guys will be more aware of the
position too because i'm going to be reading this and going into this more do you have anything
you'd like to say to end this show um to the audience to keep an open mind um i think
we all suffer from not only preconceived notions but ideas that we hang on to and
we love our ideas and that's true of me and it's true of everybody and and it's the hardest thing
is to keep an open mind that's that's one thing um and the other thing is a new testament is one
of the most incredible books it's like a mystery novel it's like a puzzle i really we have a Swedish
term puzzle mystery it's so well cleverly written and not a word is there for no reason it's everything
means something um it's so cleverly written it's amazing um and yeah and um hey another thing i
would like to say as i'm now doing the same operation on the old testament and uh people are
already i'm getting some expert readers who are like screaming out loud um
i don't think that people make up history as a rule they may need to skew history they may need to
to push history one way or another they may need to adjust history but people have a really strong need
to tell the story and i that's why i'm not a physicist i don't believe people construct stories
out of thin air i think they do it for a reason and that they base the story on reality you got me
uh questions so many questions you know i'm thinking of like romulus and like if there were other
deities that might be like you know but but then again that's a different show for a different
time maybe that we could just talk about different things but even that's not your field that's not
your area necessarily i just there's so i agree there's i agree i agree there's something there
for sure and i i wonder you know i hear these scholars say these old testament characters
did not exist and so what does that mean does that mean that there was no basis to reality on
these people in history are they based off other people maybe uh i have other guests that come on
this show too miss anaheim and sorry if you don't mind me saying that i'm just from the south so like
my mom and dad always taught me to say mrs mister you know and just be kind to people um but they
look to find who these guys are and like i have a guy named ralph ellis he comes on he talks about
he thinks that they're egyptian so like adam and eve is probably akhenaten and nefertiti
you know and there's like shift in either place time or something where they're using the story
and it's uh it's obviously not necessarily exactly what reading but there's something else going on
usually and they're still saying that they're historical people and then others say they don't
exist like i um lots of critical scholars say like moses didn't really exist but then there's some
who say yeah but once again here we are there's probably a guy it's just not what you're reading
necessarily but there's probably some truth to it and i'd really be looking forward to your book
that's coming out and when that gets a new one yeah we'll do a show on that it's coming in swedish
this fall and i'm gonna translate it to english probably myself to to do it pretty quickly um
but we can talk about it once it's out i'm i'm um i think it's the same thing with the old testament
it's it's basically true history but it has been adjusted for religion religion demanded it so to
speak well in case you're wondering and anyone else we are myth vision
