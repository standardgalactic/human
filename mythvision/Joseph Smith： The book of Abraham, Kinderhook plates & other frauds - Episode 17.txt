Mormonism guys I mean this guy the more that I'm learning about Joseph Smith I hate to say this
it's like when I watched you already know where I'm going like when I watched the Sopranos for
example like I'm like this guy's a bad guy okay this guy's like but he loves his family like he
really loves what he does in life and he's a he does love family he has family tendencies he has
things that I personally you know can relate to at the same time he's a bad guy and Joseph Smith's
a bad guy but like when he gets captured I'm like is he gonna escape he better make it you know I
don't know why I want the bad guy to win it's like there's something wrong with me so price
will you help us out man so okay this has been you know a crusade that I've sounded off about on
this series before but like this is the side of Joseph Smith that no Mormons learn and it's so damn
interesting if they were to teach this stuff in church I'd like to think that the church would be a
lot more mature that the members themselves would be a lot more mature because you you when you
examine the life of this guy and and just the the story arc that he left in his legacy you see so
many things about the human condition that are that are not curable that there are things that we
all deal with to some extent and I love exploring this world of Joseph Smith and there's a whole
community of people similarly minded who explore this person and explore this history because
there's just so many fascinating stories within it and it does cause you like you said Derek where
you're like why am I rooting for the bad guy what the hell's going on here it feels weird but still
at the same time for some reason we like an unlikable hero it's it's weird or or yeah he's a
very likable hero he's a pure villain straight-up villain but I mean the guy is charming yeah charming
and that's it there's he he's one of those people that has that X factor that has that intangible human
element that we don't know why but we gravitate towards those individuals and I don't think that
anybody living as a contemporary of him could answer that question more than we can today of what is so
appealing about this character what's so fascinating why does he capture and cultivate our our minds
and our imaginations so much and there's there's just there's more there to the story than the story
itself will tell us and for that reason alone I just I revel in this history I love it I just
can't get enough of this stuff me too you left off with Porter Rockwell looking like John the Baptist
down in a bar and he beats the crap out of some guys and he's looking at Joseph Smith like yeah
we're about to throw down buddy like nine months of no shaving probably eating honey and locust
you know what I mean there's no telling what this guy was doing well it's and it's worse than that
because they they said jokes come down quick there's some crazy sauce watch man down here
and so they come in they don't know who it is they all of a sudden you know and then Joe sees
eyes and sees who it is and it's just this magical reunion you know well and to be clear like yeah
the dude hadn't shaved but he also hadn't bathed he had been living in dungeons for nine months like
he he he was he was not recognizable until you saw his eyes and it's like these these guys who you
know Porter Rockwell and Joseph Smith have been friends since they were like five years old you
know you know those those eyes regardless of how much grime is covering them and so let's talk about
Porter Rockwell right so this guy you know he had been friends with Joseph Smith long before the
church was ever conceived and long before the gold plates long before any of this the Rockwells and
the Smiths were good friends in Palmyra and Manchester area so they they become good friends
and throughout the entire history of the church you know Porter Rockwell is the youngest person
baptized into the church on its first day April 6 1830 in in New York he was you know close to
confidant of Joseph Smith in Kirtland and Missouri Porter Rockwell made himself more and more useful
to the prophet in whatever way he possibly could and then finally in Nauvoo now when the church is
at its you know at its critical mass and it is requiring underground assassin squads in order
to survive this guy is placed at the head of one of the companies of this assassin squad that's
known as the destroying angel company and that becomes a euphemism as a warning from from the
prophet or from anybody who is you know in the community you know that if you speak out about
the church then you're going to get a visit from the destroying angel which became synonymous with
Porter Rockwell himself so he is you know for for all of these same reasons that were like Joseph
Smith is a likable villain Porter Rockwell is as much in the the culture of the church today as he
was back then he is mythologized as a you know a wild west badass that Mormons love today even
though he was a total monster he was a murderer yeah he was suddenly definitely wanted on your
side because he would come through to you he would get you over that mountain he would get
through whatever it took Porter was your guy yes absolutely he also was a notorious screw up
so there this is more so the case in the Utah era but he was also not let's just say he had some
street smarts but he wasn't always the smartest when it came to logistics and there were a few
assassinations that he botched that Bill Hickman had to come in and clean up and there there were a
few times where Porter Rockwell screwed up but under Joseph Smith's command him and Joseph were
such close friends it didn't matter if Porter Rockwell screwed up they were going to be friends
no matter what and it was this symbiotic relationship between these two men but Porter Rockwell
I was gonna say I think it's interesting that Wyatt Earp and Perrick Gatt I think it is what's
to say it says Wyatt Earp and I'm looking at Wikipedia real quick and Pat Garrett so like while
he was uh he was he was famous and controversy controversial during his lifetime as Wyatt Earp
and Pat Garrett so lots of people know like Tombstone you know the show the movie Tombstone
with Wyatt Earp like this guy's like that you know he's he's that kind of figure he has reputation
as a gunslinger because he had killed I wouldn't say 43 men that they knew about in open just an
open you know draw and boom you know not counting all the people he'd been assigned to kill secretly
on the down low yeah well in his career of of uh murdering obviously expands greatly in Utah
because there are no he is he is the law right um and it's him it's Bill Hickman it's Jedediah Grant
who was Brigham Sledgehammer uh it's Hosea Stout there's there's a whole litany of these these
these dark and seedy figures and you know Samson Avard was that in Missouri and you know Joe always
had a cabal of these darker figures around him uh at any given time because those people are super
useful when you're trying to build an empire right and that's what Joseph Smith at the end
of the day that's what he was always aspiring to was building an empire uh but you know Porter Rockwell
had been imprisoned and Joe had sent that guy Jackson to go down and finish off bogs and to
break Porter Rockwell out of prison and Jackson wasn't successful um but also like Jackson was
getting more and more ingratiated in the the leadership of the church um and Porter Rockwell
didn't like Joseph Jackson um thought that he was an enemy or another Bennett type figure who was
just there as an opportunist looking for a grandisement um so Porter Rockwell was Joseph Smith's
bodyguard and he might and might well have been that exactly that an opportunist who was just in
there as a uh you know yeah yeah absolutely um so it is notable right like Porter Rockwell gets
arrested by these bounty hunters uh and taken to Missouri and he's can you know conveyed around
all sorts of different prisons and stuff like that um so what the state had on evidence to try and
convict Porter Rockwell was the affidavit of the guy that he shot claiming that it was Porter Rockwell
who pulled the trigger that's all the evidence that they truly had to try and convict Porter Rockwell
which the state knew that they couldn't that that was the evidence was too flimsy to carry out the
conviction right not to say that we don't have good evidence ourselves now looking in 2020 hindsight
just say oh here's the gun that did it here's his connection to it blah blah blah so in in hindsight
we have good reason to think that yes he was the one he was the shooter um but anyway as you say
but but at the time right it's always cloudy when the events are contemporary right um so so the
the state is moving him around different jails trying to get different convictions uh trying to
you know hold him for for different uh charges and stuff like that um and he attempts his first
prison break and this first prison break he very basically works with somebody else who had recently
been convicted uh allow you know get him to use some of the tools and a pouch of a buck shot that he
tried to use as a blunt weapon um and this is the escape attempt where like he wrestles with the
the woman jailer and like tumbles over her as they fall down the stairs and he runs out into the
courtyard and vaults the fence and the guy who he like worked with to escape couldn't vault the fence
because he was too fat and he had eaten too much uh so Porta Rockwell goes back and tries to rescue
him but by the time Porta Rockwell gets him that guy over the fence the whole town is out it's late
at night everybody is out there surrounding him and they try and lynch him on the spot right there
for trying to escape from prison uh but the jailer it was able to successfully get the jail cell
closed and get the people out and keep Porta Rockwell in um so that first escape attempt did not
work out for him um so they tried to convict him for escaping uh attempting to escape prison uh but
through some technicalities the charge didn't actually stick so they were just like all right so
we're gonna hold you over to court uh until like the the autumn the autumn session of court so you
have to stay in jail um and he tries to escape again and this second escape attempt involves him
while he is uh chained and not hobbled but while he is chained he rips the stove pipe out of the
ceiling of the dungeon and he takes off his clothes and lines the hole because it's you know
it's a hole cut in the wooden floor he lines the hole with his clothes and tries to and climbs through
the stove pipe hole which is you know it's 14 inches across like and he's a he's a stout guy
uh but because he was being mistreated he was also very underfed in all of this so he had lost
a ton of weight he was gone he was had low energy um so he had lost a lot of weight and he was able
to slink up through that stove pipe hole um and he was also able to to rig um some tools up and he
was able to get through the first door but jail cells uh jails in that time had two sets of doors
they had the inner door that had a locking mechanism on the inside and then they had the
outer door with a locking mechanism on the outside um second door and then he resigned himself to his
fate and was too tired to even crawl back through the hole so he just laid there on the floor and
passed out and they the jailer found him the next morning on the upper floor out of the
dungeon having escaped but unable to get through the door and eventually that was one of the charges
another attempt to escape prison that was finally the charge that stuck so uh he ends up uh getting
if we remember back to the Missouri Mormon War there
if we remember back yeah if we if we remember back to the Missouri Mormon
sure no all right one more time yeah I did it again sorry okay um if we remember back to the
1838 war in Missouri there was a general in the Missouri militia uh who was a friend of the Mormons
but wasn't a Mormon uh he was known as a jack mormon and this is the guy that one of the generals
commanded to execute Joseph Smith in the town square of far west the next morning and this
guy refused that order he refused to carry out an order from his superior officer this guy is
named general alexander donovan well this guy alexander donovan was legal counsel for the Mormons
during the the court of inquiry after the the 1838 Mormon war and the two Mormon cities surrendered
and were sacked uh and the Mormons were forced out um well port of Rockwell wanted alexander
donovan to guard or to uh service his legal counsel uh and donovan said well I have too much
of a caseload I can't do this and the judge there was like it doesn't matter you're his legal counsel
now so donovan was like I'm not sure what to do with this port of Rockwell guy um I'm gonna try
and get him transferred out because all of the judges were the same judges that were you know
the people that were intimidated when their houses were surrounded by the Mormons they were the same
all the same people that were involved in the Missouri Mormon war just five years prior so
donovan tries to get port of Rockwell a transfer and he ends up getting a transfer successfully
pulled through um and when the transfer happens these two constables are responsible for conveying
port of Rockwell three days on horseback to the the location transfer um and they do this knowing
that the Missouri citizens view port of Rockwell as public enemy number one uh he will be assassinated
if these constables aren't careful transferring him from one jail to the other um so to prevent him
from escaping they tie his legs underneath the horse and then tie his hands behind his back
and they carry him on horseback three days on back roads to keep away from any possible
assassins who were trying to kill him and that's a weekend fun trip that yeah oh lots of fun lots
of fun yeah and Rockwell even said that it was a hard riding horse and he doesn't even have like
his leg strength in you know holsters or anything he's just bouncing along for miles and miles and
miles so you gotta feel bad for him too and he's also underfed uh he's probably uh you know struck
with dysentery and diseases um he's he's in a bad way dude is suffering a lot and like this is
I don't care who you are like prisoners don't deserve this treatment I don't care what you've
done like you don't deserve this people don't deserve treatment like this but he got it
uh and he was public enemy number one um so he gets transferred to that jail
and uh there's another hearing that's scheduled in front of a different judge who was
more impartial to what happened uh and the judge said hey there's a problem with the paperwork
sorry take him back oh and the constables have to carry him back on another three-day horse ride
tied and hobbled to the horse uh bouncing and evading assassination attempts of which there were
there was they tried to assassinate him both on the journey out there and on the journey back
without success so once again he's hobbled he's he's restrained he can't do anything uh he's
thrown in a dungeon and he just has to wait it out and finally General Donovan was able to get
him a hearing in front of Justin uh Justice Austin King and Justice King is the very judge who
was chaired the November Court of Inquiry with the Mormons back in 1838 um and he's they went
forward with enough uh evidence that the charge for him they didn't have enough evidence to charge
him for murder uh or attempted murder the charge ended up being attempting to escape prison
how ironic is that it's like the Al Capone it's like oh yeah all these you know machine gunnings we
can't get you on but but tax evasion tax evasion yes exactly yep yep they always get you on something
like that right uh so they uh they have a full hearing he pleads not guilty to trying to escape
prison which he did General Donovan tries to argue a technicality that breaking out of prison
involves breaking a lock or something to that effect and which Porter Rockwell didn't break any
locks he didn't break any doors exactly uh so the the justice determined uh so Justice King
determined that attempting to walk through a door to escape prison is also incorporated in
the Missouri law uh you don't just have to break a locking mechanism uh so the jury comes down with
a guilty verdict and he is sentenced to five minutes in jail they should have got him for
trespassing no yeah right so five minutes in jail and ends up turning into five hours in jail
Porter Rockwell knows that if he's caught or if he's seen on the roads once he's released that
it doesn't matter what the state says yeah everybody in that state knows that he is guilty
and that he was part of the Mormon assassin squad and that you know Lilburn Boggs was shot by this
guy everybody knows who Porter Rockwell is um so he's gonna be assassinated hold on hold on hold on
this is important okay this why do I feel like I don't want this guy to get killed and I want him
to survive the way you're painting this is so good dude do a show on this like seriously HBO
Netflix I'm not even kidding you like I can see this and he's about to escape and there's people
were like yeah oh he's leaving the jail in a few minutes all right it's like but I don't want I want
him to hide in the woods and like find his way through the swamps and like now okay well let's
let's let's add some more details to this right because the whole time that Rockwell is in prison
in Missouri he's also hearing you know like he's in jail where Sheriff Reynolds is the warden
now Sheriff Reynolds was one of the two sheriffs who arrested Joseph Smith in Dixon Illinois he was
one of the sheriffs who worked with the special orders from the governors of Missouri and Illinois
to arrest and extradite Joseph Smith to Missouri Rockwell heard while he was in the prison Sheriff
Reynolds talking about this attempted arrest like he did they were about to leave to go arrest him
to arrest Joseph Smith um so when that happens Reynolds leaves he you know Rockwell hears all
of this uh and this is what Rockwell said after he escaped he said quote knowing that they were
after Joseph and no means under heaven of giving him any information my anxiety became so intense
knowing their determination to kill him that my flesh twitched upon my bones I could not
help it twitch it would while undergoing this sensation I heard a dove a light on the window
in the upper room of the jail and commenced cooling and then went off in a short time he came back
to the window where a pain was broken he crept between the bars of iron which were about two
and a half inches apart I saw the dove fly around the trap door several times it did not
alight but continued cooling until it crept through the bars again and flew out through the broken
window I relate this as it was the only occurrence of the kind that happened during my long and weary
imprisonment but it proved a comfort to me the twitching of my flesh ceased and I was fully
satisfied from that moment that they would not get Joseph into Missouri and that I should regain my
freedom and that does name the holy spirit yeah right so yeah so not only does Joe not know what's
going on with Rockwell in Missouri prisons Port of Rockwell doesn't know what's going on in in
Nauvoo in in Illinois he doesn't have any idea what's going on and all he knows is that Sheriff
Reynolds his warden is heading off to Illinois to go arrest Joseph Smith and these guys are trying
to kill Joe right this is his childhood friend this is the person who he has taken a vow a decree
a covenant with God to to protect him with his own life and all he can do is sit there hobbled in
his chains and you know underfed under resourced and just dark and cold in these prisons there's
nothing he can do but just sit there and deal with it right so like there's there's you gotta also
feel sorry for for both Port of Rockwell and Joseph Smith because these are these are childhood
friends torn apart by the system of laws that they have been flaunting for years and neither of them
knows the whereabouts or the safety of the other they don't know what is going on with each other
so when you look at Mormon history how there's two sides there's the the official side where it's
only tells the good side about how amazing these people were and then there's the shadow side where
you see what they did and who they murdered and whose lives they ruined but it's it's fascinating
to be able to see both of that and still root for these guys you know in your way it's very
game of thrones that way very yeah well and that's one thing that you realize when you're studying
basically any history is that there really are no heroes yeah you have heroes you know you better
be prepared to have those heroes tarnished have them degraded because heroes aren't real people are
real um i think that's what makes the the epics a lot of times like the greek epics more suspenseful
and more i think relatable than like the gospel epics of jesus if you will like you know you know
jesus is almost too perfect it's like it's hard to there's good examples there right there's some
good examples but like you know uh some of the stories are more human in the greek epics which
makes it interesting but anyway yeah i think that uh i i like that about the greek epics more you
know there's there's more real i think there's more reality in those you know then just you know
something is that you know what's interesting about that is just to go down a very small rabbit hole
is when we start with our oldest and original gospel marx gospel he's the most fallible human
jesus and it's like you know they marx sets him up as a human guy who's born human just like us
and who gets adopted by god at his baptism and he goes into the garden and gets somebody he doesn't
know everything's gonna be hunky dory he just knows us okay god is telling him now you have to
die for asin for israel and uh when you read the garden of get the simony story like that
it gives you chills mm-hmm yeah three's gospels later by the time john goes around and he's like oh
no he's super god he might as well have i am god written on his t-shirt he's just slow
there's no pathos no drama at all um you broke out for a second yeah and as you say it's because
he's more human oh where do you lose me uh where do we live with the gospel of john yeah there's no
pathos there's no drama there's no human connection to him at all the way there is in the earliest
gospel and then he just gets better and more superman like with each success of gospel so true
david uh brice i have to ask you this to keep us on track what the heck happens okay he hears
that his friend's gonna get killed he's got a few hours till he's about to be released how does he
make it there like what the heck happens so in all of this um porter rockwell's mom actually
is one of the people who's trying to coordinate his legal counsel and his escape and everything
she ends up meeting with her son in the prison in missouri and then she travels up to navu to
collect money from joseph smith to pay for or to pay for porter rockwell's uh legal counsel to
pay for general donovan as his counselor um so she is there on the night that he is released
and as she basically tells him hey we have a couple of friends um go go to these places uh
you can borrow some money from this person and they part ways you know mother and son part ways
and say i'll meet you back in navu um porter rockwell determines that there are two ways of going
home that uh are going to be most expected and he sends her on one of the paths he takes the other
path in hopes of maybe diverting or you know you know a little subterfuge to try and keep the
assassin's office trail uh the vigilantes i should say um so yeah really it's a it's a matter of
perspective i guess um so he ends up uh he doesn't have any shoes at this point um he
hasn't changed clothes in five months uh he hasn't bathed in nine months he hasn't shaved he is he is
unrecognizable anybody who might know what porter rockwell looks like back in 1838 this
porter rockwell looks nothing like it which aided in him traveling across the state of missouri
which is probably for the best uh general donovan even warned him uh keep on guard
do not travel during the day take only back roads and keep on watch when you're traveling during
the night so that's what porter rockwell does he finds uh barns and stuff to sleep in during the day
and he travels during the night he's walking 20 to 30 miles every night um without shoes his feet
are shredded to nothing um he borrows four dollars from a friend of the Mormons that
was still remained in missouri and he uses that to pay for lodging and for for meals he even
rents horses a couple of times to take him on a short stints of the journey um but he takes he
takes a number of weeks to get back to navu he's released december 13th he arrives in navu on
christmas day um and he uses the last 50 cents of that four dollars to take the ferry from montrose
iowa across the mississippi into navu he had to be freezing yes freezing and and he's walking
over frozen ground without shoes as well so his feet are just cut up at one point he stops for
three days to try and quote unquote recruit his feet um because he was they were just so
just so torn up he couldn't walk anymore um he's it just he's in a real he was in really bad shape
and of course he's for nine months he's been underfed as well i mean fed holocaust rations
basically um so he's lost a ton of weight he looks gaunt and sunken in cheekbones um and he
porter rockwell is a portly guy he's a big guy and for him to be in this state he doesn't he's not
recognizable um so in this state is when he interrupts the christmas party at the navu mansion
late at night uh there's a brawl and and there's this missourian throwing punches at the patrons
and joseph smith hears what's going on and says throw the missourian out and he comes down and
pushes in front of the crowd and sees it's his old friend porter rockwell throws a big hug around him
and they drink and they are merry what and two minutes for this they all had the
knives out they were yeah yeah it's true and joseph was in his uh military regalia for this as well
for this meeting uh which it really provides a crazy dichotomy between what the people that are
his subjects have suffered but joseph smith had never had to suffer himself he's in his battle
regalia while porter rockwell shows up having been locked in prison for nine months hobbled crippled
gaunt and underfed um it really it really exemplifies this dichotomy yeah and that is a moment too
that joseph looks at him and says as long as you are faithful to church no blade or bullet
will ever harm you you're the new samson let me yeah let me find that exact quote was because
what happened right so once joe realizes porter rockwell he gets him a bunch of food and drinks and
everybody's happy at the triumphant return of the destroying angel right at this time uh yeah so
porter rockwell tells joseph smith everything that happened and the next day what's awesome about this
is Mormons are incest and record keepers so the next day porter rockwell goes and files an affidavit
to add to the Mormon persecution that happened in Missouri and porter rockwell tells all of this
stuff to a person who writes everything down verbatim porter rockwell is illiterate right we
wouldn't have his detailed account of what transpired during his nine months in Missouri
if not for the Mormons being incest and record keepers but because he was we have the contemporary
source which is really awesome um so he regales everybody with story and joseph smith sits back
silently and sits for several minutes and then uh quote placing his arm around his friend's shoulder
announced for all to hear i prophesy in the name of the lord that you are in porter rockwell so long
as ye shall remain loyal and true to thy faith need fear no enemy cut not thy hair and no bullet or
blade can harm thee end quote and that's this from uh hal schindler's excellent biography of porter
rockwell uh man of god son of thunder son of thunder yeah amazing biography yeah truly incredible
i have to say just a quick plug i've written a science fiction trilogy i've told you guys this
before it's a it's got time travel and porter rockwell is one of the characters in book three
um all right that's how much i always have liked this magnificent bastard yeah he truly is he's just
a hell of an awesome figure he really really is amazing and Mormon lore of the utah period is
replete with stories about porter rockwell oh yeah and and a lot of people uh their ancestors
have stories about porter rockwell uh for example uh one of my mentors uh shared what happened when
his great great grandfather encountered porter rockwell on a path through a canyon um and his
you know this person's great great grandpa was driving a carriage porter rockwell was just on a
horse uh and he was driving the carriage didn't know what you know who this person was just had
a hood up over his head uh long hair coming out of it um and and this guy's riding the carriage on
the trail it's not wide enough for them to pass each other uh and rockwell just when you know
they're coming to each other rockwell just yells out in this kind of high-pitched voice get out of
my way and the guy knew that's porter rockwell get the hell out of his way uh and and you know
a lot of people with Mormon ancestry have stories like that yeah i have another story if we have
just a few minutes to tell it yeah uh some young punk kid came up and wanted to call him out in the
street you know gunslinger style and the porter looked at him and said i think i know your dad
going home boy and and uh the kid tries to shoot him he does not blink at all while this guy is
shooting at him and he took him down and starts doing the you know dance thing where he's shooting
at the guy's feet to make him stop and uh but apparently he was never phased by being shot at
ever after he wasn't he was the Mormon samson and uh apparently except for one incident that
happened in Utah he was not shot or stabbed his entire life uh in it's one of joe's a few
prophecies that actually came true and i want to say there was one point where he actually did cut
his hair to make a wig for somebody some mother he did for for a widow actually he cut his hair
very late in his life in the 1870s he cut his hair to make a wig for for an elderly woman
and like wow it's like oh he's a monster assassin killer he would kill you as soon as look at you
but you know he does stuff like that didn't yeah yeah he was also a kind and compassionate guy
if you were his friend you just gotta be a friend somebody you want on your team for sure yep uh so
porter rockwell of course you know before he was arrested before the whole bogs incident before he
had to flee navu before he was arrested by those bounty hunters he was running the taxi service
right and he loved his his horses and carriages he loved his race horses he was you know that
was one of his fascinations it's you know like people you know like guys are gear heads now
right like like me right uh he he loved fast horses uh and he loved his whiskey um so he uh you know
before he was running the taxi service and one thing that's great about a taxi driver they hear
all sorts of conversations right well porter rockwell was no longer the taxi uh service in navu they
somebody else had taken that job uh but instead what porter rockwell did was take over as bartender
for joseph smith's bar uh and if you know anything about taxi drivers and bartenders
they both hear really interesting conversations uh so joseph gets you know one of his most trusted
acolytes to be the the the bartender at the town's biggest bar which is joe's own mansion right
emma doesn't like this though emma is really she does not like having a bar in the house she
thinks it brings in the riffraff um and also how does it look that a prophet of god has a bar in
his own home um so she convinces joseph smith to get rid of the bar well what she does is say hey
it's either me and the kids or it's your bar but one of them is gonna go one of them yeah exactly
and joe's like oh well but i'm keeping it here for porter because he needs a job and she was like i
don't care just get it out of my house uh so what they did instead is they built just like a rickshaw
kind of crappy you know bar wooden shack across the street from the navu mansion and porter rockwell
was the bartender over there you know and then the patrons of the mansion would go across the
street and get drunk and then they'd come back over and stay the night at the mansion yeah
uh so yeah and that that kind of gets us into early 1844 uh with porter rockwell joseph smith
the mansion and everything um but there are a couple of incidents that incidents that occur
in 1842 and three uh that we we didn't really hit on but they're just really fun stories in
Mormon history uh and i think i think we should spend some time with those what do you think
we got 20 minutes david what do you think 20 minutes that's enough time because there's like
these three little archaeological the what would you call them incidents hoaxes
and these are supposed to show like his flaws like right yeah these are these are one of those
stories that it's like it's very clear that Mormonism is pure unflinching bullshit exhibit a this
story instead of being this story okay i can't wait so uh we got to start with book of Abraham
right and we we barely touched on the book of Abraham earlier uh you know a few episodes ago
but it was published in 1842 and what happened is the a guy came in hocking uh Egyptian artifacts
into kirtland even crazier than that it was an irish circus owner irish circus owner i didn't
know that detail michael chanler you're talking right okay uh yeah so he comes in and he's hocking
mummies and papyri and statues and just Egyptian artifacts and joe was like oh that's
that's the book of Abraham written by abraham's own hand on papyrus uh we'll buy it and the guy
was like i knew you would say that it's 2400 bucks and joe's like i got the monies right here uh and
that was a ton of money that was way over market value for some so for some dead people and some
scraps of papyri right um but joe thought joe was a translator right and he had national
renown as a person who could read dead or unknown languages uh so this guy michael chanler you know
he capitalized on that and sold them some some papyrus that were just funerary documents that's
all they were they were just funerary and funerary documents yeah uh and he made a ton of money and
he left you know with a little heel click laughing as he waltzed out of kirtland 2400 dollars richer
yeah and to be fair these are actual egyptian artifacts he wasn't both yet those are that's
true yeah actual egyptian fragments from three different as it turned out common funerary manuals
from the sixth century bc uh yeah so let's let's uh show a few exhibits here so if you're looking
on screen now um here is uh if you look google book of abraham this is what you're gonna find right
so there are these papyrus fragments that joseph smith pulled apart um and of course papyrus
this is from it was about from the first second maybe third century c e so you know they were
12 13 14 1500 years old when joseph is playing with them they kind of fragment and pull apart
and he kind of destroys them by opening up the papyri uh by unrolling them um so what we have
here is just this is the original papyri that joseph smith purchased from michael chandler here
and you can see the chunks that are missing um it's actually basically glued to this wooden plaque
here um and uh joseph smith filled in this little portion which you can see the chunk that's filled
in this is in the printed version of the book of abraham right so joe buys these things in 1835
and he sits on them for seven years but they're finally published in the march 1842 edition of
the times of seasons um and joe claims that they are the the papyri are the book of abraham written
by abraham's own hand which is if you know bible timeline that's crazy stuff that is crazy crazy
stuff because that would that would predate any text that we have of any septuagint uh you know
manuscripts by by what 1200 years probably well oh no no more than that it's like if these are if
these are first century you know and i've heard uh that there are like sixth century bc which is
already 1500 years after the supposed time at abraham who fun fact was also a complete bullshit
but um nonetheless no matter how you slice these yet it comes up archaeological fraud uh for what
he's his purposes are and you don't even have to say that abraham didn't exist which we already
know that isn't the case so it's like but like suppose he does you this still doesn't work it
doesn't work not even not even and yeah um i totally lost my train of thought where i was going with
that but church authorities um they would say oh well you know um you know what here's the fun thing
once joseph started making all these claims about oh here's an egyptian artifact i'm gonna
translate it for you one of the beautiful ironies of his life is that he didn't realize that over in
france people are starting to decipher uh hieroglyphs the rosetta stone has been discovered and look
look at this it just opens up the whole language and now we know what these egyptian things say
and guess what they're nothing like anything he ever said during his life um and so you guys are
you guys are literally saying pretty pretty much like this is obvious evidence of just to
show you what he did his whole career and in everything that he did he had a great imagination
he would create these ideas absolutely and and use something that like it's falsifiable it's easily
falsifiable but people just want to believe you know and i will also add for x mormons
he could do this on the spot yes exactly he could do it on the spot and also i will say that for x
mormons if you take polls for x mormons what led them out of the church book of abraham almost
always hits top five it's usually polygamy book of mormon book of abraham uh priesthood ban you
know a litany of other issues book of abraham is usually in the top five because it is such a
simple open and shut case that joseph smith was a fraud it is so simple and it's really funny to
watch apologists work their way around this thing um because what it's devolved into the
changing defenses that you go ahead the changing defenses exactly because the criticism is always
the same the criticism is this isn't the book of abraham the book of abraham isn't a real thing
joseph made it up um that's the criticism the criticism stands um as more evidence comes out
as more studying is done they have to change their defenses against that criticism but the
criticism still stands it doesn't matter how many apologetic defenses you come up with if the
criticism itself is true no amount of apologetics is going to nullify the criticism um so where the
current realm of apologist stands right now is called the catalyst theory where joseph smith
basically you looked at the papyri and then god gave him the vision of what is the book of abraham
right just don't happen to have any copies of the book of abraham but god revealed it to joseph smith
but he had to have the physical artifacts of the papyri in order to catalyze the revelatory uses
inspired him but funny story back in the day when no one he had a copy of the book of abraham
or wondered what had happened to it they were saying a completely different story and then
one day in the 60s somebody finds the book of abraham with joseph's notes written on it in his
own hand and his uh and they have the actual thing and it's like all these stories about oh well you
can't until you see the actual fragment you really can't judge it's unfair for these so-called experts
to criticize it and boom lo and behold we have the exact thing and yes it's exactly what egyptologists
have been saying all along nope this is from this book this book in this book we know exactly what
they're saying that's not pharaoh that's not even a woman a man it's a woman it's goddess ices goddess
um and and careers of mormon apologists have been forged around this single thing for counter apologetic
yeah and also like one of the quintessential mormon apologists uh hu nibly that's that's a big name
in mormon studies hu nibly he learned egyptian and became b y u's egyptian professor in order to try
and create the apologetics for the book of abraham and he even made his own translation of the actual
hypocephalus and the the artifacts that we have when they were discovered in the 1960s hu nibly
himself learned egyptian and made his own translation of it to try and create the apologetics around it
and what's crazy to me is when hu nibly made his own translation of the the papyri um he was
resurrecting the same arguments that were made in 1856 and that that argument was
somebody who knew egyptian who knew egyptian hieroglyphics came and visited the mormons
in uh in navu in 1856 i think it was and looked at the papyri and said that's not the book of
abraham that's a funerary text and even translated some of the words on it from the egyptian into
english and they're the same words that hu nibly translated in the 1960s after they were rediscovered
right like in 1856 the mormons knew this was a fraud yeah and still in 2020 apologists are
their entire careers are centered around this one damn artifact it's mind-blowing to me wow anyway so
yes as i kind of apologize myself this is like the holy grail of of mormon busting it's like
it's so simple but what it did do though when joseph published this yeah it's the dum-dum-dum
of dum-dum-dum-dum it is it is it's it's dum-dum squared it's incredible dum-dum-dum-dum but
when joe had this all published in 1842 this caught a lot of people's attention and uh uh
two of these people are named wilbur fugit and henry casswell now let's start with henry
casswell i love henry casswell so much this guy was an episcopalian minister who was also
beginning to work in america as a museum curator and he was conversant with dead languages he knew
ancient greek he knew uh herew so he was a bible scholar um so he had on his person as part of one
of the artifact collections he was working with a greek salter which is just a greek manuscript of
of one of the psalms right um and he estimated that the salter that he had was probably from the
12 or 1300s uh and he said i'm not ancient but medieval old yeah yeah old very very old not
ancient but old it looks very impressively old yes exactly so to an untrained eye uh who doesn't
know any languages who doesn't know greek who doesn't know what uh parchment is the difference
between parchment and papyri um a person like joseph smith let's say would never be able to tell
what this actually is so this guy takes his greek salter and he just saunters into navu and is you
know looking at the town and it's beautiful this is uh this is summer of 1842 that this goes on
and he talks to a few Mormons and it's like hey i have something that i you know i i saw that you
have the the book of abraham there i'd like to see that uh could i get a meeting with the prophet
um and then he pulls out the greek salter and the people's minds are blown away like you've
come to the right place our prophet can read the dead languages uh so this guy gets a meeting
with joseph smith in the navu mansion uh and he's these guys are surrounded by people by Mormons
and the henry casswell pulls out the greek salter and hands it to joseph smith and was like
what do you think of that and uh you know he says so much he says i think it's a greek salter but
i'd love to hear what you think about it and joseph smith joseph smith said that ain't greek
there's not a word of greek on there and then later in the conversation he goes back on that
and says what ain't greek is egyptian and what ain't egyptian is greek this is an alphabet of the
ancient egyptian just like what was written on the gold plates and he points at the at the
capitalized letters at the beginning of each first and says that's the egyptian hieroglyphic and then
that what follows is the greek interpretation of the egyptian hieroglyphic now uh if you look at a
greek salter right um you know i'm gonna screen share again so you can see kind of what a greek
salter looks like and probably what's you know similar to what joseph smith was looking at right
so you have the capitalized greek at the beginning of each of the verse and then the verse joseph smith
doesn't know shit about any of these languages right he's making everything up so he sees these
things and says that's exactly like what was written on the golden plates that i translated
into the book of mormon and then after it is the greek translation of the reformed egyptian
and which is beautiful that it's clear though none of those things are egyptian hieroglyphs those
are all clearly greek uppercase letters clearly if you know the most rudimentary thing about greek
yeah and so and henry caswell did right so he's kind of like chuckle into himself and laughing
about this and he and and what's cool is um uh so joseph smith he's a hick right he is absolutely a
hick and he um i'm gonna try and find henry caswell's uh statement here because it's so so good um
it's gonna take me just a second i have some here if you don't if you can't find it i'm just trying
to find henry caswell's article because as soon as he left uh he he went and published the whole
story and it was hilarious um but so henry caswell himself look ahead in my book by the way if you
want to you do have this story good good good good good oh i love that so much yeah um get the book
serious yeah uh so one thing about joseph smith is everything that we have of his is uh is edited
it's very edited but joseph smith talked like a hick uh and that's one of the reasons why people
didn't expect him to be the prophet that he claimed to be because he talked like a hick but everything
all of his sermons he's very eloquent he's very well spoken he's he knows languages he's very has
a very strong command of the english language but those have been edited those are most of those
have been fabricated um the actual the actual words of joseph smith rarely peek through the
historical record and the way that he talked um henry caswell records joseph smith's words
the way that joseph smith talked and it's really really incredible because you get to see
joseph's dialect and he you lose this veneer of who the you know joseph smith was uh and you you get
to see a real version of joseph smith um i'm gonna find a just a couple passages from this because
because henry caswell is just i can't find it i've got some here uh okay yeah yeah feel
fair to read i'm gonna read through a little bit of this article uh but please do here's one thing
he says from this is from his uh his new story pointing to the capital letters at the commencement
of each verse he said them figures is egyptian hieroglyphics and then which follows is the
interpretation of the hieroglyphics written in the reformed egyptian oh my gosh and because
you never hear joseph smith talk like that in his sermon them figures is egyptian them figures is
hieroglyphics because it doesn't yeah and in our first original editions of the book of marmin
the very first editions he has things like and the prophet went awoken and yes exactly exactly
oh wow they had to clean up all that cornpone goofiness uh it was the goofiness to joe heighten
it that makes sense though that is interesting did this guy ever sell this book to joseph smith
or did he just like no joe tried to buy it but he said i'm not selling right joe did want to buy it
and put it in his uh in his uh so yeah here's here's actually the very interaction um here we go
so this is from henry caswell's pamphlet that he published it's called three days of novel
three days at navu uh he said upon this the marmots around began to congratulate me on the
information i was receiving that joseph smith was telling him oh it's it's egyptian it's an
interpretation or whatever the prophet now turned him he said there they said we told you so we told
you that our prophet would give you satisfaction none but our prophet can explain these mysteries
so the people are also sick of fans they just love this right this is joseph smith in his element
the prophet now turned to me and said this book ain't no use to you you don't understand it
oh yes i replied it is of some use for if i were in want of money i could sell it for something
handsome and joseph says but what will you sell it for said the prophet and his dignitaries
my price i answered is higher than you would be willing to give what price is that they eagerly
demanded i replied that i would not sell it to them for many hundred dollars they then repeated
their request that i should lend it to them until the prophet should have time to translate it and
promise me the most ample security but i declined their proposals we'll give it right back when we're
in all of this henry caswell was like uh no joe this is this is this is greek i know that this
is greek and then joe kind of wafts around a little bit and then um he let's see uh he proceeded
with me to his office accompanied by the multitude he produced the glass frames which i had seen on
the previous day but he did not appear very forward to explain the figures now the glass frames contain
the egyptian papyri from the book of abraham right uh so he had those framed and then he would sell
people admission to go look at the egyptian papyri and the mummies from which he supposedly
translated the book of abraham and that's how his mom actually made a living was she was basically the
caretaker of these artifacts wow uh here uh you know caswell continues i pointed to a particular
hieroglyphic and requested him to expound its meaning no answer being returned i looked up and
behold the prophet had disappeared joe ghosted this guy when he was like hey what does that one
mean what does that one mean and joe ghosted him he continues it's really great um the prophet
had disappeared the moments told me that he had just stepped out and would probably soon return
i waited some time but in vain at length descended to the street in front of the store here i heard
the noise of wheels and presently i saw the prophet in a light wagon foraging his whip and
driving away as fast as two fine horses could drop him and caswell summarizes it perfectly he
says as he disappeared from view enveloped in the cloud of dust i felt that i had turned over
another page in the great book of human nature wow quote that's well said that's very well said
yeah yeah at after this absconded by uh by joseph the Mormons turned to me he says well you know
what this is a greek salter so it's like what do you think isn't our prophet amazing he's just uh
well no this is a greek salter actually and i know that very well because i speak greek
and so what am i supposed to think of your prophet now and so the guy scratches his head and says
well sometimes joseph smith speaks as a prophet and other times he speaks as a mere man
so it's like wow dude he literally that's what Mormons say today about joseph smith
yeah still to this day that propaganda works the the catholics do it with the popes as well the
popes uh he's not speaking in fallible right now when he says that um it is interesting because
you know what you've done there as we wrap this show up i just want our audience to kind of like
take notice he went right back to the root of his entire scandal of golden plates he literally
if he didn't mention that oh that's what's on the golden plates uh what like we know you're caught
in a lie here this is greek and obviously anyone who's watching should know that obviously saying
egyptian reformed egyptian which is bs so he's saying that's what's on the golden plates i wonder
if anyone has ever seen the plates that he supposedly had in that box it's funny you say that
derrick because as it turns out just the very next summer somebody did uncover actual plates
just like the plates of the book of Mormons actual golden plates that that we have we have
i believe they're in the chicago uh chicago museum archive yeah oh my gosh we're gonna have to talk
about that in the next episode yeah well i i don't know man i love talking about these two stories
in conjunction with each other we could do we could do these plates in five minutes can you
give us five minute derrick let's go a little extended yes five minutes okay five minutes so
because joe had so much national attention right that's what happened with henry caswell
bringing the greek salter in well there's this other guy named wilbur fugit wilbur fugit
had some metallurgical skills and he and three and two other guys were like hey i bet we could
we could we could pull one over on the old prophet uh so they're gonna have a story right so they uh
they live in a little town near navu called kinderhook illinois um and these guys made they
manufactured a set of plates no no no wait stop stop there was this amazing archaeological
discovery so oh no no okay you know yeah you're right so yeah we can't we can't jump the shark
so these guys tell joseph's younger brother hey uh samuel uh we found an incredible artifacts
come and come and help help us dig them out and and see what what can be done so they bring the
the plates they they find these plates and you know here i'm gonna pull pictures of them these
ax shapes plates of metal connected by wings that are so old that they're encrusted in rust
and the rings the coils you know holding all together break apart at their touch um and at
first they like try to clean it with the soap and water and scrubbing things they can't get the rust
off it finally they put in sulfuric acid and uncover these amazing metal plates with uh ancient
writings on them exactly and this is so this is the one that uh that we still have right here but
these are mock-ups of what they probably look like here um and you know you can you can see uh a
larger image of this um let me try and pull up a large well of course it's not gonna pull up a
larger image than just that um but you get the idea so there's the small brass plates yeah um
with ancient writings on them yeah and they're brought into navu and joseph's myth loses his
freaking mind right because this is this is a new discovery this is something new to translate this
is from the ancient uh israelites that roamed this area that became the native americans um
but once again this is just like the book of abraham like the people are expecting
for joseph's myth to translate the dead language uh and to tell them something tell them something
about this so they receive the these kinderhood plates in and uh joe publishes in the times and
seasons which is the church's periodical and navu that he has begun translating these things
and that they are uh the story of the person with which they were found uh and he gives a few
details of the contents of what's on the kinderhood plates and david it looks like you're about to
read a passage yes he was a descendant of ham through the lorns of ferro king of egypt and he
received his kingdom from the ruler of heaven and earth that's about as far as he got to translate
that yeah but he so he did start translating these things right um he never got around to
finishing the project he never published a full translation of them he just told us what was on
them which is such a shame i would love to see what the book of abraham version the book of kinderhood
would exactly they weren't lost forever for all time so we never knew even though the church
authorities assure us that they were real and legit and then one day in the 60s hey they found
one found them again yep that's right uh and and when that one was found in the 60s once again
that same guy hu nibbly came out with a defense that was published in the church's periodical
its own periodical there was a defense that the kinderhood plates are legitimate they were so
excited and they were like inviting everybody the fighting the world to you examine scientifically
because they were so sure that as this is the real deal and more than 15 years past with this
knowledge with this understanding that the kinderhood plates vindicated the prophet
and finally i think it was in 1986 a metallurgical study was done with that one remaining plate
that we have and they found it good news bad news good news bad news yes this is not a forgery
it really is the original kinderhood plate yes which as it turned out is made of 19th century
metal alloy not yes that was etched with acid to make it look old yes oh my gosh and this guy
wilber fugit he didn't want to come up you know to come out and go public with the fact that he
made the plates until after joseph smith had published the the translation but joe died before
the translation was ever published so the guy just sort of forgot that he ever did it and then
in like the 1870s or 80s like 30 40 years after this happened he was like oh yeah i remember that
oh yeah no i made those plates i etched him with some acid and we buried him and we were yeah we
were trying to pull one over on joe that was it that was it it was inconsequential to him he didn't
care he was just he was just trying to screw around with the prophet but it's yet one more example
that just unequivocally proves how much joe was lying he he was a fraud he was a grifter and it's a
classic example of the same song and dance of look these are real you'll see we told you so
oh wait it's not real but that's okay oh you know what they just inspired joseph smith you know
exactly it's like i was like the biblical scholars who talk about the forgeries and the
new testament says well those were inspired by god too it's like yeah okay yeah james didn't really
write that but it's in the spirit of james even though the author's not really james or first
peter or second peter because you know that was a great honor back then they did that out of love
for them and it was very well respected right it's a totally common thing that everybody did yeah
not at all condemned by ancient sources who talk about that yeah you know much more than we did
yeah bart airman doesn't know what he's talking about no no bart airman's one of the points out
these i know i'm joking i'm joking yeah no bart is great his book fordrian counter fordrian
christianity exactly shows all this stuff going on yeah i love his book ford's but i want everybody
who's watching us to just imagine just imagine with what brice and david had brought to you today
okay um imagine if joe would have stayed alive another 20 or 30 years okay how many more stunts
like this would have this hold on him no so good that would be so good you know he lives would he
have had right yeah didn't think about that one you know tell me what you guys think down in the
comment section i think it'd be hilarious to imagine he's just one of those guys who has a
fantastic imagination because i know a guy i'm gonna leave unnamed um that i've actually played
along with this like he always knows everything and one time i said hey uh did you hear about in
the news they found that a person's body in a in a black trash bag chopped up in little pieces here
in cumberland county and he's like yeah i did hear about that actually and i made it up like i
literally just fabricated and then i'm like dude i was just checking i literally was testing you
because you always know everything and he was no no no you didn't hear there was it may not have
been in cumberland county but like literally there was a body chopped up and i mean that's the
that's what they do it's a personality thing yeah yeah ah just impervious to facts yes and
there are certain people you can you can recognize them from a mile off they are just impervious to
information and to reality they fabricate their own reality and they're happy inside that little
world it just so happens that joe's little fabricated reality extended far beyond his own little mind
it incorporated tens of thousands of people and now millions of people and you know what's the
miracle about Mormonism is i mean it is complete bullshit start fit there's just no two ways about
no polite way to say it it is completely bullshit and yet look at what this family run business has
done i mean it's the miracle of Mormonism is that it's accomplished as much as it is out of sheer
bullshit it's spungled that a sheer bullseye really and it's also really many millions alive
it's ruined as many lives as it's uplifted so you know i i will also say right well far more
it's it's yeah Mormonism has a very high body count um i'll also add into this right like
when you recognize these individuals that are just completely impervious to to facts like
there's it's really hard to break through that mold it's hard to break into that echo chamber
and like the the three stories that we talked about with the book of Abraham the Kinderhoek
plates and the greek salter incident those three stories alone right there prove no shadow of a
doubt that joseph smith was lying about it and that he knew he was lying but that the fact that he
was lying didn't matter he could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and they would still love him right
nothing he could do would cause his people to not love him and not want to die for him
wow and that right there is a truly dangerous personality yep yep and again if he'd lived
for another 20 years run for president who knows what this country would look like yeah you know
it's true guys gals leave your comments down below tell me what you guys think don't forget
