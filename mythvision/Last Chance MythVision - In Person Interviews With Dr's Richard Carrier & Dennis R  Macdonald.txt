We are MythVision. Come the fifth, I'm taking off from North Carolina, and I am heading on to
California. I'm going to be interviewing Drs. Richard Carrier and Dennis R. McDonald. If you
guys aren't familiar, get familiar, you know, Jesus from outer space. He has On the Historicity,
which I have on eBook and Audible. I'm listening to that as well. Dennis McDonald's books, you know,
Luke and Virgil, the Dionysian Gospel, Homeric Epics and Mark, you know, he makes these connections
to the Greek epics. And he also has his book on Q. I am making this video for those who are
patron members of MythVision podcast. You guys can ask your questions, send me your questions
through message on Patreon. And that way I know I'll make it make sure I take a screenshot,
ask these scholars your questions when I go to visit them next week in California.
Also, I'm going to have videos with them both side by side in recordings. So we're making
history. No one's ever had Dennis McDonald and Richard Carrier in person, side by side,
asking constant video recordings of questions. I want to make that clear for people.
We also next month after this October, I'll be going to Delcey Allison, Jr., Dr. Delcey Allison,
Jr.'s and New Testament scholars. Well, if you're a patron member and you want to ask questions,
feel free to ask. I only have one day with him, so I have to limit how much time I spend asking
questions to him specifically. But I'm going to have a whole, excuse me, a whole week with Drs.
Dennis R. McDonald and Richard Carrier. And if you want to have your question asked, become a patron.
Thank you so much. I want to make this last shout out to you guys. I could use a lot more
questions for Dr. Dennis R. McDonald. If you have them, feel free to reach out. Let me know on Patreon.
Love you guys. We are MythVision.
