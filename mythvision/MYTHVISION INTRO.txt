Does this mean everything I've believed in for so long has all been a myth?
Oh my god.
It'll be a voice that shakes the very foundation of the pit itself.
And it'll hear a voice that stops the fall.
It'll hear a voice that shakes hell.
It'll hear a voice that hell responds to.
It hears the voice of the maker, the master, the creator, the lord of the universe.
And hell itself begins to rise.
Higher it comes, up to the surface.
All for a fleeting moment.
The soul has been burning for a thousand years.
May have one moment of thought of respite.
Possibly I can be forgiven.
May be God has changed his mind.
Or maybe an opportunity.
I'll repent.
Oh Jesus, I'll repent.
I'll repent Jesus.
But it's too late.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit.
Thank you.
