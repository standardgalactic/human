Tell us what your book is about.
The book is basically about the early, early career of the God who's described and adored in the Bible.
And it's basically tracking his early career from the kind of late bronze, early Iron Age through up into, well, basically to about the sixth century of the common era.
But what I do is I basically do an anatomy of God.
I argue that this was a deity who was understood to have a corporeal form.
He had a human shaped body and a male masculine body.
And I basically try to explore the reasons why this deity was gradually disembodied culturally and theologically to become the God that we're kind of more familiar with today in Western cultural constructs.
So, yeah, that's what the book's about.
I'm a professor of Hebrew Bible and ancient religion at the University of Exeter in the UK.
I'm an atheist.
