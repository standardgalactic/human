Show us some warm and fuzzy, won't you?
Coming up in the month of July, we've got an in-depth show with renowned mythicist scholar Dr. Richard Carrier.
We'll be discussing his book entitled, On the Historicity of Jesus.
We've got two shows planned with Dr. Robert Price, a favorite with our viewers.
We'll talk to him about the legacy of the Dutch Radical School
and what it means to be a complete textual scholar.
But none of that will happen unless you help us with the production of the show.
Derek, chime in on how important it is for our viewers to help us.
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, nothing's free in this world, as they say.
But we have some special guests that we do bring on, and MythVision is trying to bring you the finest.
It's been a goal of ours to try and bring you a variety of different guests.
Yes, you may not see eye-to-eye with many of them, but it's always good to learn new things.
And we like to provide a way for people to come onto our platform,
and you being able to help us through PayPal and Patreon by anything, $2, $5, whatever.
If you wanted to monthly subscribe for $5 a month, you're helping us keep this platform going.
So I really appreciate that because we're able to help those who are scholars
and those who are out there who are coming onto our show.
We're able to do things to help them come on.
And you guys are helping us bring you the finest.
So, Luther, that's pretty much all I have, brother.
Well said, Derek. You know, it never ceases to amaze me who tunes into our program.
We've intercepted on the cosmic plane the ancient Jewish historian, Flavius Josephus.
Josephus, we welcome you to the program. What's going on, man? You're a historian.
What are you doing listening to a show on Myth?
Hello, MythVision. I guess I've got everybody fooled.
Those miraculous stories I wrote about in my Wars of the Jews never happened.
That bit about seeing armies in the clouds at sunset.
This calf giving birth to a lamb.
That's just me using celestial imagery as a propaganda tool for my employers.
Keep up the good work, guys, and don't take me or yourselves too seriously.
Wow, I don't know what to think now. We always think of Josephus as a historian.
You know, our special guest today is a lot like that.
We don't know how to categorize him.
Just when you may think that he's a historian or a mythicist, he'll come out with some surprising opinions.
He's author Michael Lido. Michael was born in a small town in Pennsylvania and was raised Catholic.
By 1973, his itinerant family was living in Charlotte, North Carolina.
There he got married and joined the Navy, serving on a nuclear submarine.
He describes himself at this time as your basic math and science geek.
In 1979, he successfully completed his time in the service and marriage.
So the prison sentences are now over. Don't take me too seriously, the ladies in the audience.
But at this point, when Michael wasn't following the Grateful Dead around,
I love that he's a Grateful Dead fan. Me too.
He was working as a subcontractor at various nuclear power plants and as a radiological controls technician or a radiochemistry technician.
It was during this period that he took an interest in religion,
asking God to show him the truth, which led to his atheism. Ouch.
I asked God the same question and wound up doing this show. Go figure, right?
But listen, even as an atheist, Michael still had an interest in biblical stories
and read everything he could get his hands on, combing used bookstores in his travels.
This is before the internet was up.
He gravitated toward discredited 19th century authors seeing some good aspects within all of the bad.
Michael wrote one modest book in 1995 published by the Atlanta Free Thought Society.
He had planned on reviving the works of the prolific poet, writer, philosopher, and Egyptologist Gerald Massey
and rekindling interest in Massey's comparisons of the Bible to astrology.
But the disorganized way in which Massey wrote caused Michael to really shell the project for years.
And it wasn't until he heard Richard Elliott Friedman speak on the hidden book in the Bible that Michael got his second win.
So his first step was to gather the needed background information on the stars and the constellations.
And there was plenty of material available. It was just a matter of matching up dozens of stories to their proper stars and constellations.
It didn't happen overnight, but once Michael figured out that there was a pattern to the stories, he was in the home stretch.
He has written two books on celestial mythology called On Earth as it is in heaven.
That was in 2009 and the secret astrology of the Bible the following year.
They are both available on amazon.com.
Being his own worst critic, Michael will begin to revise and amend certain assertions,
although he's still convinced that the Bible consists of many astral myths.
Please welcome to Miss Mission Podcast Michael Lido. Michael, it's great to have you with us.
Thank you. It's great to be here.
I want to start out with an amazing new discovery, something that is a game changer that goes against everything that the scholars have told us about the origins of the constellations.
They tell us the origins of the constellations was about the time of Sargon 2000 BC or so.
Makes sense because they look at the constellations, how they're arranged.
You got Tars, Sarah and the spring for the plowing.
You have Lieber there as the tombinal equinox for weighing of the crops.
It all makes sense that this was the period that was in.
They tell us it was the Babylonians that started all this.
However, the Greeks tell us it was the Egyptians.
How would they know? I mean, compared to our scholars, right?
I have the Egyptian spider. Let me see if I can get this screen.
Launch for you.
Okay.
Anyway, if you Google Egyptian spider rock, can you see the screen?
Nope. Go ahead. I can edit this. Don't worry.
Hold on. Let me look at it. I had this.
Hit share and then desktop.
Okay. I got to go to the big screen and then do the share.
Okay.
How's that? You got that sure now? You're good.
All right. That's the Egyptian spider rock.
And if you Google it, that's what it's going to come up with.
And they'll tell you this is all types of different things.
There's one guy who actually measures the angles of these
and tells you how it was astronomical, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
And it's amazing. This is like refrigerator art.
There's some things you've got to remember about ancient astrology.
Number one is that the constellations were never drawn to scale.
Sometimes they're not even in the right place.
And rarely do they even look like what they're supposed to be.
So anybody who comes along and does the measurements on these rocks,
they're out to lunch.
So what I did was I used a technique that I learned from in kindergarten
and then carried on is that if you take a picture or something,
you adjust the resolution on it, you can get better scaling on it
to where you could just take your penny pencil and color it in
and see what it actually looks like.
So when you do that on this one,
all I did was color in the lines and come up with something like this.
And this is an astrological symbol.
Now, what you have to remember in ancient times,
you had to know something about ancient stuff.
And one of them is that we do have an actual spider on the spider rock.
There is one and one only.
And that is in the constellation of Orpheus.
And if you read Richard Allen Hinckley's book on star names
and goes into the legacy, he tells you it used to be a spider.
Now, a lot of times it's like a half a sentence.
You can get him.
We have a bird down here where Scorpio would be.
Sometimes Scorpio is represented as a bird.
What we also know is Hercules.
The constellation of Hercules used to be fields.
And in the Bible, these were the fields that were given to Abraham.
Abraham was a combination of both Hercules and these fields.
The rewok is broken right here.
This was a line that separated the land of Hercules and the land of Lot.
And Jesus would also become a field.
So these would both be fields separated by a boundary line.
That's what we have from the Old Testament.
This is supposed to be somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000 BC.
Probably more like 6,000 to 8,000 because right in the middle,
we have the Libra Scales.
I would assume this would be the summer solstice.
And the scales in Egypt were not for measuring crops,
but this was for measuring, if you remember in the Book of the Dead,
they used the scales to measure a man's heart,
to see if he can go on into the afterlife.
So this was like a New Year's, like Janus in Rome,
forward, backwards, probably a reflective time for when
they could make their New Year's resolutions back around 7,000, 8,000 BC.
Over in this one corner, we have like a face of Leo,
which is really, it's really sad refrigerator art.
I kind of overextended the bug up here, the scar of up for cancer,
but the most interesting part was right here, is Virgo.
We have her sitting right here with a woven dress,
which sometimes they call the spider, and she has outstretched arms.
So this is the constellation Coma.
They combine the constellations all into one constellation here.
And normally this is Isis holding the baby Horace.
However, we can see she's wearing the crown,
and this would be the crown of lower Egypt,
which is the northern crown, which is probably better off off over here.
This is significant, because this is the first, this is not really Isis.
Let's look at Isis. Let me see if I can pull that up on another one.
That's the planet sphere of Dendera from about 50 BC or so.
And in that one, well, that's Isis with Coma.
It's very similar to what we have on this very ancient one.
It hasn't loaded yet.
Huh?
It hasn't loaded yet. We still see the same screen.
Okay.
You don't have the Coma in Dendera screen.
All we have is the same one that you first started showing us.
The spider rock.
Yes.
Okay, I'm not sure how to...
Can you minimize this one?
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, there you go.
Let me minimize that.
Here's...
Okay, now it's back to you.
Let's go back to the share again. Let me see if I can hit the share.
Okay.
I have it now.
Coma in Dendera.
Coma in Dendera, yeah.
This is from about 50 BC.
And what we see here is almost identical to what it is from the 7000 something BC.
And that is amazing itself that over thousands of years,
they basically have the same constellation, the same way.
However, if you notice on Isis right here, she is not wearing the red crown.
Isis never wore the red crown.
All right.
We have to go back.
Now let's go back, see if we can go back to the other one.
Oh, I almost hate doing this.
You're looking good on your own.
You got the old one, original one back up.
Okay, so here she's wearing the northern crown.
And this is very significant because Neath wore the northern crown.
So this went from Neath to Isis.
Now, the significance of all this is, and there's multiple significance.
Let's first talk about the northern crown.
The northern crown is that spiral shaped one that goes around in a curly cube.
It's part of a maze.
The northern crown represented the maze that Dionysus went through in Greek mythology.
And I identified as the constellation of Tamar, where she has the twins and the one-sixth's hand out.
They tie a red string to it, pulls it back in, and then the other child came out without the red string.
All right.
The red string is the same as the red crown.
It's circular.
And this is womb imagery.
The string and the curly cube represents the umbilical cord in the womb of the child.
And this is almost universal throughout Europe and Egypt.
That is what it is.
And you'll see women wear that little maze thing, okay?
You know, the ones that don't shave their armpits.
They got that on there, and they're part of Greenpeace.
And hey, they like that little maze, ancient maze imagery.
So that's where they come in.
Now, this is part of your prophecy.
This is Horace.
Horace was going to be all these wonderful things.
Prince of Peace, King of Kings, Salt and of Swat.
You know, all those, all those superlatives that you could possibly fit into one sentence that only Dickens could get away with.
And then this goes on.
This same prophecy goes on into the book of Isaiah.
You remember Isaiah where it predicts the coming of the young girl will conceive.
And then this was used in the Bible as a prophecy for the coming of Jesus.
So here we have, probably around 7,000, 8,000 BC, we have the prophecy of the coming of Jesus right here.
If that's what you want to believe.
But yeah, this is that.
So Isaiah, and they had this big discussion.
Atheists love to talk about it being the young girl and how it's mistranslated into virgin.
Because these guys who spoke Hebrew and Greek as their first languages, they didn't know the difference, right?
They obviously mistranslated.
No, they mistranslated it correctly.
Gotta hate air quotes.
But they did that.
They did that because they recognized it was part of this prophecy of the virgin.
So when they translated the woman as being the virgin, it was because it was Virgo.
That's what this is.
Now, if you're one of those ancient astrology guys, hey, you can have here, you can have your spaceship launching pad,
and you can have the spiders from Mars.
That's right.
If you're an ascension, it'd be the spiders from Mardak, okay?
Yeah, I like that.
Yeah, that was his 12th planet.
But yeah, I mean, that's what this here is about.
It goes into the...
Now Eve, I don't bring this up, but this goes into the...
Now, Eve, one of the things they talk about in Eve, if you could find some Egyptian books,
is that she was androgynous.
They're saying she might have been also male, and they say, no, this can't be so.
Somebody messed up because she also has the title Mother of All the Gods.
So how could she possibly be male?
The same is true with Ishtar.
Ishtar was also supposed to be both male and female.
And this is because they represented the planet Venus also,
which the morning start...
We'll keep it simple.
The morning start was the male, and they were both the goddess of war.
So in the morning, when the Venus comes up in the morning,
the troops would assemble, and they would go out to battle to have war.
She was also the goddess of love.
So in the evening, she'd be the female.
Venus would come out in the evening also.
Rome...
Rome had named...
Did not go into the androgyny stuff.
They were a little different.
So the evening one was Venus, and the morning one was named Lucifer.
So in Isaiah, where they have the Lightbringer, which should have been Ishtar,
he translated anachronistically as Lucifer.
He recognized it as being, you know, the morning start when he did that.
And had he not done that, we would have probably never got
Louis Cypher, a great movie, Serpent in the Rainbow.
But, you know, that's where all this came from.
The morning and evening androgyny of Venus.
Now, Ishtar, this is also Eve, who is a representation of Ishtar.
And if you go...
And you can look this up in Wikipedia.
Eve comes from Hiva, from the Hittites, H-E-V-A, or H-E-V-A.
This goes back to the Hurrians, H-E-P-A-T, if you've got it online, looking up it on Wikipedia.
And then this actually, he goes back to the Hurrians.
It goes back to a woman, Cuba, who lived before Sargon Territory.
She was the only Sumerian queen listed in their books.
And she was deified.
She was deified and combined with the goddess of Ishtar
and given the title Mother of Us All.
And there are those pictures of her online, too, where they made sculptures.
Honestly, if you want to go back to where Eve came from,
she actually came from a real woman, the Mother of Us All, from the Sumerians.
And that aspect is really not in my book,
but that's something I've discovered since then, since reading Wikipedia.
So, all this is simple.
Anybody who has a penny pencil and can trace, you know, can go online,
look at what the scholars looked at, trace it in, and come up and say,
hey, what you have is totally wrong.
You hosed it, right?
This is not the spider rock.
Now, there are spider rock cultures all across, mostly in the New World.
I would suggest, my guess is the spider rock culture is developed
when the spider symbol was part of the summer solstice.
That would make sense.
We're looking at this 8 to 10,000 BC error or so,
and that has had all your major migrations happen.
This is when, you know, when they came across the Bering Strait,
went down into the New World, which is all where all your spider calls were located.
That is my guess, that this was the universal symbol that came out of the caucuses
or wherever.
Antonea, Golbeki Tepe, this is where this probably came from at that region.
Everything spread out with the Indo-European languages
and down to the Semites and one over there.
But there's very little in common, astrological-wise,
that we have with the New World and we have with Australia.
Everybody who says otherwise is probably out to lunch.
Simply because like Australia, Australia is separated from us 50,000 years ago
as far as the human population is concerned.
That's from DNA sequencing.
We know this pretty much for facts.
Like facts, if you can't get around the facts, I don't even want to hear it.
But so anything that they would have in common with the rest of the world
would have been from maybe 50,000 years ago.
And I just don't see it.
But you can make comparisons from all the way from Egypt to India
in all three Europe, I would say they're all legitimate mythological comparisons.
And in fact, there's so many books out there on common myths in this area.
It's just incredible.
So yeah, they have certain things in common.
And most of the myths they have in common are concerned the vernal equinox
and the summer solstice.
So what you have are creation myths, flood myths,
and the myths of fighting with the dragon.
And those are the very common myths that go in between there.
You get outside of that and the whole thing falls apart.
Okay.
Okay.
Derek?
I could track that pretty well.
I mean, obviously it raises some interesting ideas.
You know, it really does.
And I thought we were going to ease our way in.
There was no foreplay in this conversation.
This thing is all okay.
Like I said, this is a game changer.
It is.
It is. Nobody warned me on that one.
No, I wanted to surprise you.
I wanted to have your initial reaction.
I told you Spider Rock is a game changer, but that was about it.
I like what you're saying here.
So technically what you're saying is they used a different,
I think Randall, or not Randall, Carl Sagan said something about how
different cultures used different animal motifs,
but they all used a similar zodiacal structure for celestial,
you know, on earth as it is in heaven type of motifs.
This is like before the most common,
I guess you'd say the most newest structure we have, correct?
This is a, like a pre, I don't know what you would call this.
This goes further back though.
Wouldn't you say that?
This symbol that we have of the zodiac,
that we can positively identify as being part of the zodiac.
So this predates all the Babylonian stuff.
This says it's actually not Babylon.
So all the theories that I have about it coming out of Babylon are incorrect.
This is, you know, saying the old Greeks, they were right.
They knew what the heck they were talking about.
I love how Virgo is almost the same as what it, you know,
it is thousands of years later.
And Leo, well, sorry, I mean, this is refrigerator art,
and a lot of people, you know, they'll look at this and they'll get the angles
of these lines and stuff, and that is totally meaningless.
It's one lady, she saw this, and she said, oh, this is the star Cirrus.
I give her points for like not going into the jump, jumping on the spider rock stuff,
but that's wrong too.
I mean, this stuff is kind of obvious as to what it is.
And you can blow it up and color it in yourself and see if you come up with the same thing.
I mean, it's not.
And so now your homework now for your term paper is to go find a rock online somewhere
and color it in and come up with something that's a total game changer.
That's, and anybody can do it.
And my advice to all the PhDs out there is when you start to color them in,
use the wax crayons.
It's easy to get cleaning off the screen.
Michael, it's over there.
If you don't mind me.
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
Can you guys hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can hear you, Derek.
Something that just makes me wonder.
I did not realize that Hercules was once a celestial motif for fields.
And what I find very interesting when you're looking at old stories like Abraham,
Moses, and things throughout the Old Testament, and of course Adam and Eve and the flood,
you know, the deluge and everything.
So star names, is that where we go?
This is the Bible.
This is what I use mostly to write my book.
I would look in here and I would look for the little things that he would say like,
Oh, Hercules, the kneeling man, he was this, he was that.
Oh, he was also a field.
You know, it'd be like half a sentence in their type.
That's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's kind of like the gospel when it comes to star lords and myths.
There is a website.
I'll plug that.
I also use run by Anne Wright.
Her name was spelled with an E. She's out of Australia.
I communicated with her quite a bit.
And she has a lot of information from this book and others on her website.
And I used it because he doesn't have actually everything in it.
There is some other stuff that's out there that other guys,
I think I named Robinson wrote and I couldn't get a hold of their books.
I ended up using a website for that.
But Michael, have you,
have you seen Ian Ripath's book or Deborah holding?
They've also got some material very close to this.
I think probably not as in depth as Alan.
I have other books.
I don't know who wrote them on this on star lords stuff.
And I have found nothing that compares to Alan.
I mean, he's kind of like,
he's kind of like the guru on this stuff.
I would say most of their stuff is kind of watered down versions of what Alan has.
Right.
Right.
From what I've seen.
So let me ask you a question.
I don't know if this was involved Michael and anything we were going to talk about,
but you know, till this day,
we still have a struggle between, you know, believing Christians and Bible believers,
whether it's Jews or Christians who are defending the Exodus that took place.
And then you have the scientists are saying,
hell no, there's no way that many people came across this place.
And they weren't slaves in Egypt and blah, blah, blah.
Is this a celestial myth here?
Is this why people are confused and they're really arguing past one another?
Because they're not even knowing what they're looking at.
Of course it's a celestial myth.
I'm the guy who believes everything is a celestial myth.
I mean, what?
I mean, I don't do...
I don't do...
I don't do...
People who go archaeology review, they have seminars.
And I went to a number of these seminars with the PhDs and stuff like that.
And I talked to the guys in the universities who teach the Bible.
And basically, they don't believe the Exodus happened.
Simply because of the Hebrew language itself,
there's no words in it that are Egyptian,
that would have been Egyptian idioms and words and phrases
that would have infused themselves into the Hebrew language.
And it just isn't there.
It doesn't exist.
There's no way they could have been in Egypt all that time.
Now, if you want to talk about that,
let me see if I can pull something else up on this.
But yeah, it's basically...
Hold on.
Let me pause this for a second.
Let me get off here.
While you're looking that up, I think this is important to say.
If we're looking at it in the way you're presenting it,
it did happen technically in the stars.
However, it did not actually happen on Earth.
So it's kind of like a win for both sides, if you will.
So everybody can stop arguing now, right?
It happened, but it didn't.
Okay, enough said.
The famous Lambert compromise.
I'll take it.
Yeah, it happened in the stars.
It was just...
It happened.
It's like the on Earth.
Like I said, on Earth as it is in heaven.
Hey, Michael, I was sold as soon as I discovered
the Eridanus River was up there
as I was studying the constellations.
And I immediately connected it philologically to Jordan,
because both have this root that means descent.
And I said, wait a minute.
Jordan, Eridan, in Hebrew, it would have started with a yod,
and therefore Eridanus.
I said, wait a minute.
All this stuff is in the stars.
I've been hooked ever since.
Uh-oh.
I have the Eridanus River as the Nile in the myth.
And I kind of leave the Jordan River out of it.
It's, if it was in the book, it would have been
probably somewhere in Pegasus.
I can't see.
I have that here somewhere.
Yeah, there it is.
Okay.
And what are we looking for, Michael?
I got it.
I don't know.
I'm going to share this right now.
There we go.
You got that now?
Yep.
All right.
Now what happened, they created a false history.
This is why the Bible, the Old Testament was spectacular.
They're the only ones who actually did that.
You have other areas.
They have the cosmic myth, but they never put them together
in one big story as a history and a contiguous matter.
This is where the Bible is unique in that point.
This is the end point of all your astral myths.
This is where it comes.
And you could use the Bible to figure out just about any astral myth
from the Indo-European Semitic region.
If you just know a little bit about what's going on.
The Nile, the Eridonis River is right here, floats around.
There is something called the ostrich basket or ostrich nest
right at the front.
This is the basket that Moses had found floating down the river in.
There's an eggshells up here where somebody had died.
This is the slaughter of the innocents.
So Moses, he kills the guy and he runs off to Midian,
which is up here.
This is where Joseph... See, Joseph was here.
The story of Joseph ends right here in Taurus.
Back up a little bit.
He was in Taurus, I think in the original text.
The brothers did not recognize him.
He recognized his brothers.
He gave them what they needed.
He threw a little don't trip on the way out,
which was a little joke that he had in there.
And the Hyades in Taurus,
Romans had a saw feeding her piglets.
And that's what basically this was,
was Joseph was feeding his siblings.
They were feeding off him.
And when he was taken out of the pit,
he was taken to by the Midianites.
See, right here is Midian next to here,
and they dropped him off in Egypt.
Now we got to get from Egypt.
Now we got to get out of Egypt.
So the next story starts here in Egypt.
Moses goes up to Midian where he meets his wife,
Sephora.
Sephora, which means bird over fall.
Right.
In ancient Babylon,
it was shown that this was a...
The constellation was actually a bird
sitting on the back of Moses.
So we have that connotation there.
The brightest star in the Pleiades is,
was it Cepheus,
who was the wife of Poseidon,
and also was a heartbeat,
a little bird-like creature.
And also to connect us to the Pleiades is,
Moses' wife was one of seven sisters.
Although the Bible doesn't say seven sisters,
it says her father had seven daughters.
So you have to figure that out.
A lot of people have trouble with that.
So we go up here.
The burning bush is the head of Medusa.
It oscillates.
It's an oscillating one in,
as far as the brightness.
It goes several magnitudes of brightness.
I don't know how they possibly could have seen that back then,
but apparently they did.
And the head of Medusa
was also known to have,
to speak.
And this is where he meets God
up here in the burning bush.
And this is a very evil sign.
This is a satanic sign.
This is evil.
So when Moses leaves and comes back,
what happens is we have this odd scene in the Bible
where God is wrestling with Moses
and tries to kill him.
Not exactly part of any sermon that I've ever heard.
I honestly haven't heard many,
but it just doesn't play into
your normal theology.
They tend to like brush over this.
They skip it.
Some of your Bible scholars say,
well, it really wasn't Yahweh.
It was maybe,
maybe it was like an angel or something
and they mis-wrote this.
But anyway, he tries to kill Moses.
That's a major plot point.
I don't know about you,
but God trying to kill somebody
who he wants to do his work is a major plot point.
Yeah, Michael.
The atheists don't miss it.
We belong to some of those groups on Facebook
and they make a lot of points about that.
Yeah.
So they come back,
go back here to the beginning
and we had this odd scene
where Gershom is suddenly circumcised.
And there's this funky
phrase in there
that he threw it,
where they translated that they threw
the circumcision, the skin
at Moses' feet.
And actually the literal
Hebrew translation is
he touched his foot
or it could have been
or feet.
There's no plural in Hebrew.
So I'm looking at foot right here.
It's the foot of Orion.
And we know about the heel of Orion.
This is where she touched
Gershom's foot
with the knife.
That's how that should be translated.
And literally that's how it would be translated
except the scholars don't like that.
We go through here
with the Nile.
We have the plagues.
One of these stars is the frogs.
It has to do with frogs.
So we end up with the plagues.
And then when we get to the Red Sea,
the crossing point is actually down here at the bottom.
There is a bridge here, a land bridge.
The literal translation is
the hand of Yahweh
pushed back the soldiers
of the pharaoh.
So this is, you have a hand
or a paw in this case
on the Nile River.
This is where they would be pushing back.
So this gets them over into the desert.
And here we have where
this would be
Mount Sinai.
Mount Sinai would be the star mirror.
And if you remember, God was not always there all the time.
They had to walk around the mountain
say certain things and then get them there.
Well, the odd thing about this star
is that this star
is oscillating also.
And it's not always visible.
Sometimes it's visible, sometimes it's not visible.
So it's just like God was on Mount Sinai.
Another thing I just recently discovered
is that Mardak, who I connect to Moses,
one of his tasks was to
make his constellation disappear.
In constellations, the stars are basically the same thing.
And that would be probably this star right here
that he would make disappear.
And then from here, he moves up
and he conquers the Amorites,
which was right here.
And here he was the symbol Amaru.
This was where the Amorites were typically
associated with the constellation of Aries.
And then he moves down to Moab
where you have the ring.
There's a ring that is the binding
to your enemies, which is what happened
when they went into the Moabites
where they intermarried with them.
And then the burial of Moses,
what they say about the burial of Moses is
no man knows where he is at.
And that means there's no star for it.
That's one of their keys.
There's no star for it if no one knows where it's at.
Love that!
Great translation.
If it's there until this day,
it means there is a star for it.
That's what it means.
Your oceans and your
land points are down here at the bottom.
Your plains generally run through the middle here.
This area right here tends to be hills.
And then you go up into the upper regions.
Those are mountains and your towers.
So it has certain
geographic qualities
of the constellation.
Now, I have a question, Michael.
You got Mount Sinai down here.
And I thought the burning bush was on Mount Sinai,
but I could be mistaken.
No, no.
He did the burning bush when he went to visit his wife.
Right.
I mean, that was up here in Midian.
Okay.
It could be, but this is where the burning bush is at
and this is where the Mount Sinai was when he was in the desert.
Okay.
Michael, why is Cetus the sea monster,
the guardian of the wilderness?
He's got his paw on the river
and he's sort of the gateway to the wilderness.
In other words, you can't talk about the wilderness
without talking about that constellation of Cetus the sea monster.
Why is that?
Tie that in for us with the number 40.
What's the significant value? You have a good insight.
Yeah, the number 40 is a
constellation number that they use.
40 years or 40 days meant
that's how much time they spent in that constellation.
And then it tells you to move on to another constellation.
Cetus is the desert
because there's very few stars in it.
It's very open up, very blank.
That's why they made it the desert.
And I believe,
some scholars say
this is the monster Tiamat
that was slain by Mardak.
I believe Moses
is derived from the word Mises,
from the Assyrian word meaning hero,
which they applied to the
Babylonian god Mardak who was very
prominent.
They just changed the I to an O
and I have another whole theory on that.
I don't want to go into it this time. Maybe we'll talk about that a little later in the show.
That's all that had to do.
They were very similar.
If you read in the book of Psalms,
it says that Egypt was Rahab.
Rahab was the monster.
Right here in Cetus was the monster that was slain
by Mardak, his most famous
feat.
Mardak was then
combined with
this guy named Sargon.
They deified Sargon and they deified his grandson
and combined him with Mardak.
Which Sargon, there were two.
Sargon the great, back around
2500, 2400, 2200 BC or so.
That's the first Sargon.
Not the later Assyrian guy.
The first one who started
all these books
on astronomy and astrology.
At the Vernal Equinox,
this is all about the Vernal Equinox.
The celebration of Passover.
Even the word Passover, the Paschal celebration
comes from the Acadians.
Sargon would lead the Acadians.
He would don the cloak of Mardak
and he would lead them in a play.
Their own little play
for the Vernal Equinox.
They combined him with Mardak.
His story
is the same. His birth start narrative is the same.
He was found floating down a river in a basket.
His name was Moses.
He's combined with Mardak.
If you read this guy named Joseph Campbell,
one of the things he'll tell you is
that this story of Sargon
being placed in a basket and floating down a river
is a cosmic myth.
He never says where that cosmic myth is.
He doesn't go into any details, but he says it's a cosmic myth.
You can just make your own connection to
Moses yourself as being a cosmic myth.
It seems to me that a lot of guys
like Joseph Campbell would have
I've heard a lot of people who try to shy away
from making Bible characters
or even going towards Christianity.
They'll lump all these religions together showing
oh, Celestial myth, Celestial myth, but then you start getting stuff like
Christianity or New Testament.
Oh, let's shy away from that. Too much criticism.
Nowadays we're kind of able to freely discuss these things
with me if I were to take a logical
continuation of what you're saying.
These 40 days, these motifs of the slaughter of the innocent.
All that's in Matthew. All that's in the New Testament.
All that's talking about Jesus.
He's copying Moses. He's copying Old Testament Celestial myths.
Here we are right back into another Celestial myth
in the New Testament.
I know that's not where we're headed with this
because really just showing the Old,
you can show in the New the news copying the Old.
But just dealing with the Old is so important.
I think it's great. I love that you're showing this right here.
Telling us the story of Joseph and then Moses.
I was wondering if you have
the story of Samson by any chance.
I don't know if that's something you had prepared, but I know
for a fact his name meaning little son.
That's an obvious one. I know a lot of esoteric teachers
and Celestial myth guys
are always pointing to him saying, this is cosmic.
This is obviously Celestial.
Samson comes from the
Babylonian sun god, Shemaaz.
The reason why sun gods are judges
is because when the sun comes up, you can now judge things.
There are certain characteristics of sun gods
is that they had
they liked women
and they went out there and they, yeah,
they had a very strong apple.
I can't believe you.
Judge Samson and the sun god.
Now his story breaks
from
let me see if I can pull this up again.
Again.
This story breaks from the tradition
the way that I was writing the Bible and how things
went.
His story actually repeats a lot of the constellations
that was there.
So his story starts with Leo again
and where he was born
Leo, you have a story about the brother.
Not the brother, but the lion.
He kills the lion
and he has the bees in the lion
right at the mouth of Leo.
There is a constellation known as the beehives.
Right, right.
Technically, from what I know, that constellation
is a modern nomenclature
for the beehive.
Here we have it in ancient times.
Does that mean they knew
about the story of Samson
or how did that work in there?
Michael, the beehive was also called the manger.
Alan talks about it
as it had the other name of the manger.
That's right.
In the Old Testament
that was the place where the servant
slept, Isaac's servant
when he went to go get his wife.
It's the same place, the manger.
I don't have that.
Anyway, yeah.
So it goes from there
to there.
He gets tied to Virgo.
Virgo was his first wife, gets tied in the tail
to her.
They added the part about a barren birth
on Samson, which seems to have been added to the story.
That is cancer.
It's this constellation of the barren birth.
So he goes through there.
And they set it up in order to get into Aquarius.
The southern
fish of Aquarius
was the point of the
old winter solstice
where the sun god would have lost all of his hair
and was blinded. That's classic winter solstice
imagery where he loses his hair.
His hair was actually the rays of the sun.
The sun was the power.
So when they cut that off and they blinded him,
that was the winter solstice.
And the star
in the southern fish act also represented
the temple of Degon,
which is where he was.
So we have this coincidental thing in ancient times.
Aquarius was also
in ancient times also. He takes the jaw bone of the
ass, hits the water, and all this water comes out.
And that's where you see all that water coming out of Aquarius.
And there's also connections to some of the
constellations around him.
One is he is tied up
with ropes made out of new flax.
And that's a Pisces reference.
The ropes in Pisces and the flax.
So there's aspects that go into
Pegasus and around
Samson. So yeah, that whole story
was designed to give us a story on the winter solstice.
Kind of thought that already too.
And that's pretty cool. I always thought that was interesting.
Michael, tell us something interesting.
What is something pertaining to this?
Is that enough yet?
I'm trying to
get some of your favorites because
I could tell you mine and ask
questions pertaining to that. But maybe you could delve into some
interesting things you don't think a lot of people are aware of
when it comes to this. That you like.
The story of
Cain and Abel.
I like that one.
That may not have been part of the original.
The constellation
is Centaurus.
You can see him stabbing
in the side of an animal.
If you want to know what Cain used to kill Abel, he used a spear.
That's what the constellations would tell us.
Not a rock, a spear.
It's the same spear
that speared Jesus in the side.
Right down below Centaurus is the southern cross.
That southern cross was the mark of Cain.
We know that from the
Midurashian told us it was like a tal.
It was like a capital T.
The cross of Jesus was the mark of Cain.
Kind of odd thing.
That's where that was.
That whole area was the passion
of the Christ.
Next to that was Scorpio, which was Judas.
He was the healer.
That would be Nicodemus.
You have the northern crown, the crown of Thorns.
You have the garnet star of Arcturus
which I identify as the road, the mocking road
that they put on him in the Old Testament.
I identify Arcturus as the code of many colors
or at least the code of one color that Joseph had.
I have to ask Mike.
You got me excited hearing this.
Earl Doherty.
I got to get into Amethystism for just a second.
I think this is an important question.
Earl Doherty had a theory
that Jesus was neither a man
nor God, not Yahweh, but some angelic being.
He plays an angelic role.
It appears to me
if you've got any taste
of people who've done the celestial myth
in the New Testament, like reading Devil's Pulpit
or something to these guys.
My question is this.
You're saying kind of give way to their idea
of a celestial Christ, a pre-existent,
crucified in the heavens type of idea
of a Christ figure.
I'm sure you've heard these discussions before
but that's what the debate boils down to.
Christians say a man was born,
he really lived, he really died,
he really got spirited aside
and cried of thorns and wore this robe
and was crucified on a cross and ended up in a tomb
and rose again from the dead. All this happened here on earth.
This could not have happened in the heavens.
This could not be some pre-existent crucifixion idea
even though you read in the passages
and like Revelation it says he was crucified
before the foundations of the earth.
That makes me think this thing happens somewhere
in the heavens.
There's a lot of writings out there
I think you see this right
about the Christians who believed in Christ
before he existed, the Catholics and stuff like that.
If you look at the Gnostics
they will tell you
that yeah Jesus did this, that and the other
and they will agree with you 100%
but the stories are all correct.
They are really young stories.
How do you reconcile that?
The only way I can reconcile that
is that they believed it was a cosmic myth.
I find that really easy to do
but they want to believe that Jesus actually existed.
It's possible that a man actually existed
that they attached myths
to.
There's two things that we know
for certain that didn't happen that are myths.
One is miraculous
virgin birth.
That was all cosmic myth.
Bethlehem literally means house of bread
and that would be the
line of Virgo the virgin
which means the cancer which has the manger there
it also has a star that represents the ass
this is clearly the cosmic myth.
You go into Orion which is Nimrod
you have the belt of Orion which is the three wise men
that are walking toward the star Sirius
which was the star of the east.
This is all right there.
The other myth is the crucifixion
play.
There's a book called the 33 crucified
saviors that go into all these different saviors
that were crucified and the reason why they have that
is because it's a myth.
I went through that whole thing before
with the southern cross and everything else.
The thing about the Christian myths
is that Jesus was a solar god unlike Yahweh
he was a solar god.
When you're looking at the mythology and placing it
in time you're looking at the constellations
that appear right before sunrise.
You're looking at
for instance
for Easter this is why you have your sunrise worship
service so you can see the southern cross
which we actually can't see anymore from our latitude
in 33 AD.
But right now we can't see it but back then
you could because all that stuff changes.
That's where this comes from.
The fact that his constellations take place
right before sunrise would indicate he is a
solar deity.
The halo that he has is solar.
That's what that means.
This transition Michael
from lunar to solar
Goldzer who wrote a famous
poem called the mythology of the Hebrews
says that lunar gods were primarily
nomadic and as people
transcended the desert and they created cities
by bodies of water then
obviously they didn't have to travel by night
by the cool of the night and they were now making
a living through agriculture and they became
solar worshipping people.
So is that what's going on with Yahweh
and contrasting him with Jesus
or let's say David and Jesus.
David is another lunar god
is reflected in lunar deities
and Jesus in a solar.
Is there also this thing about nomadic people
No.
I don't think so.
You had lunar gods that go all the way back.
I will say that lunar gods tend to be
somatic and in Indo-European cultures
they were females
and they are males in the summits.
You go back to the city of Ur
and the city of Heron
that Abraham was from
those were moon worshipping cities
so you're going back to 3000 BC
your first city, one of your oldest cities was
lunar. Now the Babylonians
made things really
confused because every city had
its own gods. Some were solar gods
some were lunar gods. One of them even
was the bird which was the Pleiades
and when they conquered another city
their god became the supreme god
over the other gods.
So whatever story that may have existed of their god being better
had to be changed.
So they changed that to where the god of the conquering city
became the supreme god.
Now if they got conquered by somebody else
they would always change again.
So you had all these narratives and it made it very
confusing. Unlike Greece which says
they got Zeus here and this is where everybody at
and you guys go fight all you want it's not going to change the gods.
Stories will change
but Babylon was totally different. They changed this all around.
So the lunar god was big
during the early Bronze Age
but then when Hema Marabi came in he liked Marduk.
And Marduk was a solar god
he was identified with Jupiter and he was a
specific solar god that was associated with the
Bernal Equinox.
So he was the hero of the world.
That's where he was.
So he was big at that time.
And one of the reasons why I thought
of the original biblical text and I'm wrong on this
was written in the early Bronze Age because all this
information seems to be
from the early Bronze Age
to middle Bronze Age period.
So that's why
I initially jumped on that. I spent a lot of time
on my book discussing Bronze Age
period and how this Bible was written in the Bronze Age.
It was not written in the Bronze Age.
As a matter of fact I've come full circle on that
and that's because of you.
Dr. Williams, you said that one word to me.
You said, can I give you that one word?
Plastics. Oh no, no, that was William Blake.
You said politics.
Yeah, you said politics.
And I started thinking politics. Yes, politics.
The last way this was written was because of politics.
So I started looking more
at the data that's out there.
And there is no record
of Moses or
David and Solomon in Jewish
writing
before the third and fourth century.
I mean, you have something known as the Elephantine
Torah, which talks all about Passover.
It doesn't mention Moses once.
It doesn't mention none of that stuff,
which you would think would be in there.
So all this writings came
after this time. It came basically
after the Greeks had invaded
Judea.
So now I'm like, well, why did they make it look old?
They would have a library full of information.
They would have to have a library full of
maybe even Alexandria. I don't know.
Maybe the public library of Jerusalem.
I have no idea where they got it, but essentially
there was a lot.
They had a library full of information that
they drew on.
They made this thing look deliberately old.
They added stuff to it to make it look like it was being
updated.
Gee, I'm not sure which theory
is more incredible, whether this one
or the Bronze Age one.
I have to go with the facts.
The facts is the Bronze Age is out even though
they tried to make it look like the Bronze Age.
I spent a lot of time discussing the Bronze Age.
We gave her the title, the Shakespeare
of the ancient world, because she wrote so much.
I thought all about him.
I love Nautimus. They should do a movie on that guy.
He is great.
No, it's not.
Now I have to rethink this whole thing.
There's a book there for you, Dr. Williams, if you
care to go into it, on the conspiracy
theory.
My next thing I'm going to look at is the
Neolithic times, trying to get all that stuff together.
I want to do a book called
Evolution of Religion from
cave porn to Jesus.
Something of that nature.
Working title.
Thank you, sir.
I'm much appreciative of
your consideration of me.
We got into this area about politics.
That's my word now.
Let's get into it now, shall we?
The Old Testament stories
written for the Hasmonean expansion.
Derek, you should love this.
I want Michael to talk about the Hasmoneans
and how they adapted scripture, used it.
As you said, came up with these basic texts,
made them sound old, made them sound revised,
but there was a purpose behind it.
What was that purpose?
My internet's
fast enough.
There you are.
We got you.
The question is sometimes they limit my bandwidth.
I'll tell you what I need to do.
I need to get rid of everything else that I'm running here.
Did you catch Luther's question by any chance?
Did you catch that question?
This is just
working title.
This is just a working theory that
I just came up with.
I don't have everything into it,
but one of the things I discovered
is that
the conquest
of Joshua
and the territories that he
conquered is the same as the Hasmonean expansion.
This is kind of like
what they went into.
We're looking at
a couple hundred B.C. or so,
140 B.C.
We are one degree away
from the constellations
going from Aries to Pisces.
Yes, sir.
Right now, we're like one degree away
going into Aquarius.
That's based on the Assyrian model anyway.
They had set up
and whoever,
I think the rule was whoever was
designated as the
Bernal Equinox, whatever, let's go back.
Zodiacs are called houses.
This is because they represented
houses of people, families
represented by the Zodiac.
This grew into cities.
Cities were represented by constellations,
particularly Zodiac constellations,
and then later this would go involved into nations.
Nations would be represented by each specific Zodiac constellation.
In ancient times, Tars was Egypt.
In ancient times,
Aries became Amorites
and slash Babylon,
which they attached to Greece also.
If you see the
Alexander,
he would have the ram's horns on the coins and stuff.
He was part of this Aries.
So now we're moving into Pisces,
which was the early symbol.
They actually used two fish early on.
This was the symbol of Pisces. This is the new era.
So Pisces was going to have a new ruler.
So what the Jews did was they created this,
my theory is they created this old,
this book that made it look like it came from ancient times,
handed down by maybe God himself
that would say that the Jews were destined
to rule this area.
So they fought against the Roman Empire
for five generations or so
for over 100 years,
trying to fulfill this destiny.
We see that in the book of Revelation
it was supposed to be the culmination where they actually went and defeated
the Roman Empire, which didn't happen.
Now I was reading a story in Julius Caesar
and there was a blurb in there that says,
Rome went and conquered this area to bring peace.
They thought it was their divine destiny
to bring peace to this region of Earth
by conquering it and making it a state.
So it's kind of funny how everybody
is using God to justify their wars.
I believe that's what the Hezbovians were doing.
There are, for instance,
Joshua has elements
that would show it was
Greek. It was written during the Greek time.
The flax, the roast bay out of flax was Greek.
The being hidden,
they were hidden actually in the wings of Pegasus.
This was Greek.
The only thing that was not Greek
was the original Pisces which was the two fish
that was kind of universal.
But the other details going into it, going into there,
going into Pegasus, this is all Greek
and would have been written after the Greeks.
Even some of the stuff,
if you look at the blessings of the children of Jacob,
how he disseminated the blessings,
one of them he gave Dan two specific blessings.
He gave him the judge and the serpent.
The judge was Libra
and the serpent on the foot was Scorpio.
The Greeks had those two as one constellation
where a Scorpio would be
the scales was actually
the claws of Scorpio.
The Greeks had that as one constellation.
They were putting this as one constellation
because of the Greeks, but it was actually two constellations
and the Babylonians had it as two constellations.
They were doing it both ways.
There was a peculiarity
that when you start matching up the suns
to the zodiac sign,
Reuben the firstborn,
the wildest water one
is Aquarius.
When you figure it all out, Benjamin,
it's Capricorn.
You're looking at the first month of the year
and the last month of the year in a calendar
that the Romans created about 154 BC.
Oh my.
Now you're asking,
well, it could be a coincidence, right?
The coincidence of 1 being 1 is like 1 in 12
and you multiply it by 1 in 11 times the other one.
The size of this happening
coincidentally would be like 1 in 132
which is not astronomical,
but you've got to ask yourself, is this a coincidence
or is this me putting them together
to be this way?
There's a lot of ways you can figure this in,
but I'm looking at,
if we look at the Dead Sea Scrolls,
and they're only partial now,
but that contained verses of the blessings,
they date from that period.
So I'm wondering if the Dead Sea Scrolls
were actually a place,
where they were manufacturing Scripture
and not just reproducing it.
And we also know that there's two Psalms there
from David that are not in the Bible,
but the Dead Sea Scrolls have two extra Psalms
that were composed at a later date
than the ones that are in the Bible right now.
So they were doing something there,
so they were doing some composing,
and they have added verses to the Bible
in the Dead Sea Scrolls, just minor stuff,
but yeah, they were composing.
Two quick points that would seem to add to your hypothesis.
The story of Joshua lists his father as Nun.
We know that he's the son of Nun.
The Gamatria of Nun, which means fish,
it's a word that means fish, is 153.
Where have we seen that before?
153 fish, it's in John,
it's Pythagorean, it shows Greek influence,
much later, and here it is in the story of Joshua,
who is the son of Nun.
Again, that would seem to argue
for a late date, as you are saying.
And then you go to the blessings
in Genesis, what is it, 48, 49?
49 something like that.
49, okay.
And the father, Jacob, who's also Israel,
says to his sons,
let me tell you what will befall you in the last days.
The numerical value of last days
is 1290, where have we seen that before?
That's in Daniel chapter 12, verse 11.
1290 days from the abomination
of desolation till the temple
is destroyed.
Again, that is Greek Gamatria,
Greek influence Gamatria,
right there in the Genesis 49 story.
And we pretty much know that Daniel chapter 12
dates to the Hasmonean period,
it dates to the early Hasmoneans,
165, Maccabean period, 165 or so.
So I think you're right on target.
Yeah, I have.
Later Daniel was actually written in Greek,
so it's like, yeah.
I'm not sure of the number.
I told the folks no math, okay?
I'm sorry, Mike, I'm sorry.
Forgive me folks.
Derek, edit that stuff out.
Yeah, I started looking at that type of numbers
and I have a hard time getting into it
because there's numbers all over the place,
there's letters all over the place and it's,
to me, you can make just about,
it's worse than my theory,
that you can make anything be what it wants to be
if you want to do it.
So I'm very hesitant to go down that road.
So I kind of avoid it all together in my writings.
I'm not denying it.
There may actually be something there,
but it's, I'm kind of like on the fence about it.
I like things simple.
I like to keep things simple
and that starts to get a little bit more complexity for me.
So like tracing with a,
your black thing on a screen,
to see what the constellation, what it really is.
That's simple, okay?
That's fun.
Awesome.
Yeah, I can see where it's connected.
There could be some connection there.
Okay.
Definitely is,
but obviously more research.
We could do a show on that in particular at some point.
I really, really, really enjoy what we've already discussed here.
And now you're going to, you're writing a book.
You said, what is this book that you're,
you're going to be publishing here at some point?
I haven't started on it,
but I'm looking at ancient symbols.
K, art, trying to get something.
Since we have,
what I showed,
what I started to show off in the beginning is a connection
between ancient times,
between the cave and the Neolithic art and the modern zodiac.
So we see there's a lot of connection there.
It goes back to that time.
So the question is, how far back can we go with this?
We know the migration patterns,
and we know that it basically,
Golbeki Tepe is probably ground zero
for where this stuff came from.
Plus that's the only place we've got to monolith.
But, yeah.
Yeah, I have my suspicions that there might be more,
that we're just not,
what we can put in concrete,
it is not concrete, but in stone, I guess you'd say.
There's so much I wish didn't get destroyed,
weathered, natural disasters,
possibly catastrophes that have wiped out during the Ice Age,
the melting of the Ice Age,
man, there's no telling.
I always tell this to Luther,
and I like to think like that,
even though we like to stick with concrete evidence,
we like to stick with what we can prove.
But I told my wife one time,
I sat in a Mexican restaurant,
I was down in Georgia doing a job.
And I said, honey,
what if 40,000 years ago,
they had little food joints, you know,
and there was a man who,
or no, let's say 40,000 years in the future,
and a man sitting down,
he says to his wife,
honey, have you ever heard of the USA?
And she's like,
I mean, that was like a myth,
a story about like a civilization
that practically ruled the world.
And he's like, you know,
I'm not so sure it was a myth.
I think there was a place,
and it was an amazing place,
a civilization that really had
its reaches across this world,
and influenced practically every civilization
on this world.
She's like, stop with that crap, honey.
There's no public evidence
to prove USA,
or the United States of America,
was really what you think it is.
I mean, we know that we were hunter-gatherers
12,000 years ago, honey.
And that's kind of how I think.
I know, I'm not saying that
at one point there were satellites
floating in outer space.
I'm saying though, we may have restarted,
you know, many times.
I don't know.
I mean, we may have had our points in the past
where catastrophes have come in
and kind of took us from where we were,
and we went right back to square one.
Scratch that stone.
Okay, we got fired.
All right.
I'll just...
I have a hard time with that theory,
because simply advanced civilizations,
if they were,
they never got into metallurgy.
You got to have metallurgy.
You got to have stainless steel.
You got to have all that good stuff.
Plastics and everything else.
There's no record
of this ancient civilization
doing anything besides stone.
I'm not suggesting...
Yeah, I'm not suggesting
like this type of civilization,
but I'm saying
even as advanced possibly
as, you know, the Greeks,
you know,
to some degree,
maybe we've had civilizations
that have gone to this degree,
and boom, you know,
retract back.
I don't think they were building airplanes
or possibly having cars necessarily.
I'm just saying,
I know that the Discovery Channel
had something like after 10,000 years,
what would happen,
and the only things that we would recognize
of human civilization,
if all life went extinct,
practically, that would be the only thing,
and it would be the Great Pyramid
and Giza, and
they say
what is the name of the...
where they have the presidents carved out
on the...
Mount Rushmore.
Yeah, but I don't know.
I mean, that's the Discovery Channel once again.
Yeah, Discovery Channel.
They're like the History Channel, too.
It's like, when are we going to see some real history
on the History Channel?
I don't know.
It's like, come on.
Yeah, I just kind of wonder
before the Ice Age, if these guys
were tapping into some of these celestial myths
and how far back does this stuff go,
you know?
Well, it all started.
I like to think it all started.
I don't know.
You ever see the movie 2001?
Yeah.
Love it.
Now, in the book,
in the book, he had a name.
Moon Watcher.
And that's when it started.
When we were still hairy guys
looking up, looking at the sun and the moon.
That's when all the astral myths started.
And it grew out of there
and it evolved, and we probably
wouldn't even recognize what the initial ones were.
But they kept it simple.
And, for instance,
one is like
resurrection
and reincarnation.
Thank you, Michael.
Yeah, just when it gets juicy
every time, right?
He drops this bomb
and then we lose him. Michael, are you there?
You were about to tell us
the answers to the universe.
Sorry, folks, but
gotta hit that Patreon and PayPal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Give it a second. I know he'll come back.
He was just talking about death and resurrection.
Maybe he died. He'll resurrect soon.
You know. Yeah, you're right.
Michael.
Let's hope he pops back in.
Oh, we lost him.
So he come back. We lost him for a second, guys.
Look, something I want to hear, Luther.
And this just has me fascinated.
I was actually listening to a lecture.
Someone was proving
and showing how we have
technically,
I don't know if it would be called a gene,
but a God gene.
And he was explaining why
humanity had come up with
God, how we evolved
and had came up with the concept of God
in our minds.
He says it's all natural.
He explained why we
developed these ideas, okay?
Today we would evolve those ideas
in the further. But, okay, Michael's back.
There he is.
Hey, Mike.
You're back, sir.
Yeah, that's my
wild blue internet
connection there for you.
No, that's your
impersonation of the Apostle Paul.
He drops a bomb and leaves town.
We're not going to let you do it.
No, tell us. You said
death and resurrection.
You were right there.
Death and resurrection
comes from
the sun setting and the sun rising.
The Egypt,
their land of the dead was in the west
where the sun set. That's where everybody
went to die, was in the west,
because the sun set there.
It would resurrect in the east.
It would come up again.
And they had different sun gods for the morning
and evening and everything else.
They had reincarnation and resurrection
as simple sun
moving up and down.
So those
stories
could be universal
throughout the world or other
world simply because that's what
that is.
You know,
it's just based on
something's a myth.
I think that makes sense, especially
Easter Sunday.
The idea of
him resurrecting.
I don't think they have to ask her.
But yeah.
I've heard Easter
but yeah,
either way, questions.
Easter sounds like presentism.
Yeah.
Yeah, it does.
Let me ask you this about the
holidays, the holy days
of the Bible.
I've heard it said
and the argument has come from
those who deny the mythological
motifs that what we're talking about here.
And they'll say, you know, there's no
dying and rising god motif here
with Jesus. It's very unique.
This is a historical guy. They just made
this whole thing up pretty much almost
like it's authentic to the Jewish
version.
Now, they say the only way that you could say
that is if this had agricultural
significance.
They always throw that out and say
unless the Hebrew Bible, the Hebrew scriptures
are agricultural,
you can't make the argument
this is another dying and rising god
that is borrowing from other
myths because the other myths
are agricultural.
Are these myths agricultural
in nature based off of like,
I mean, everything that we're seeing with
the Hebrew holidays and
do you see it
agricultural in nature?
There
is a lot of it is agricultural.
I mean, the Passover and stuff like that.
I'll
give them that. However, let's
I'm looking at
one of the
one of the aspects, one of the things I was looking at
agriculturally, I believe
that Virgo
was the constellation of the
vernal equinox
when it was created. That would make
sense. Here she is, the virgin,
the opening of the virgin.
This would be
agriculturally related
although
she goes into a time period
before we had agriculture.
So I'm kind of like struggling
with the whole thing.
They like that virgin opening up
the virgin
of the spring.
In the Bible, this is
where the Amorite
soldier kills his daughter.
This is in the
constellation of Andromeda, which again
was a sacrifice
of the female virgin
which is actually not a spring
constellation, but kind of like right
before spring.
So when he kills his daughter, there are
things that we look at. One of the things
is she's a virgin.
Well, what does that have to do with
anything? So she goes up into the hills
to lament her virginity
up into the hills.
That's Andromeda, which is above the
Zodiac.
One of the things that it describes,
she's wearing these trimbles
on the wrists and ankles
and that is similar to Andromeda
who was chained.
So we have these different aspects
in there.
It's not the same,
but we have the similarities.
That's what you have to look for in comparing
astral myths is
so much the story
lining up and being same, but having
certain points
that are identical.
And on the opposite of that
is sometimes you get two stories that
look identical
that are nowhere related as far as
cosmic myths go.
You can have it both ways.
Wow.
My favorite one,
I think I mentioned this to
Luther before,
is the Pisces, the Joshua.
In the Greek mythology
is you have Venus
and Cupid
or Erez was
or is it...
Anyway, the two of them are else women.
And then this sea monster comes along
and then they turn themselves into fishes.
So they want to stay together
so they tie a rope between themselves.
And then they go hide
from the monster.
Well, this is a story of Jericho
which is nothing like this at all.
We have
Joshua, son of Nun. Nun can be plural too.
Fishes.
And then
they are the two spies.
We have the number two.
They go
and meet Rehab.
Rehab is another name
for sea monster.
And then she hides them
in a wall of flax.
And
they have to tell us it's flax.
I'm not sure what the significance
of the flax being that they hid
these spies in other than
it's connected to the flax
of the rope that was tied to the two
fishes. So to me
when you have these idiotic little
tidbits of information
in the Bible that are totally meaningless
of the story,
the only thing I can think of
all of a sudden is just
astrological.
It's
you know
why else would it be in there?
This is beautiful though.
Somebody was actually there
and saw it was flax and wrote down
it was flax.
No, come on.
Get out of here with that.
And even if it were,
let's say they were,
why would they even include that?
The last thing.
Yeah.
Probably the last thing you put in there.
You know this reminds me, I can't remember.
I was in English honors in high school.
We read an Indo-European
story. I cannot remember the name of it.
They did a cartoon movie about it later
on, sometime during
my generation.
And it's about
a swamp monster, sea monster
type thing. The guys are celebrating.
They're eating their feast and the monster
comes in. They can't pierce
its skin.
They're trying to kill this
sea monster fish thing.
And the guy, the hero who always
it's part of one of those myth motifs once
again. The hero ends up taking
either sword or something.
He was able to rip,
or maybe it wasn't with the sword, maybe he was able to rip the arm.
An arm off this beast.
You might know what I'm talking
about if I kept going, but
rips an arm off, the beast runs.
It's actually the child of a mother
beast. And
it goes.
Is this the Grindel thing?
The what?
Grindel, the movie
that had Angelina Jolie in it.
Mmmm.
I don't know.
I don't know, but he rips the beast arm off
because the beast was so strong and then this guy
comes on. It reminds me of Hercules.
It reminds me of Samson, but
an Indo-European style type one.
He tears the arm off of this beast.
This beast thought it was going to grab him
and just kill him, or beat him.
And he rips the beast
arm off, and the beast in shock
runs while bleeding,
bleeds to death.
And I think the mother of the beast,
the seed monster,
finds out that her child was killed.
So she comes back for revenge.
This was all, I remember
reading this. It is so left
filled. I know I'm coming out of nowhere with this,
but it just tells
me that these cultural motifs
and myths,
they're all over the place, man.
And they're all trying to tell us similar things.
They may not be identical. Of course, this one
wasn't identical. This was a
Anglo-Saxon myth.
I'm sorry, Anglo-Saxon.
And, uh,
I just keep seeing
more of these super strong
heroes, you know, that can
pull swords out of stone,
or can, you know,
lift gates off cities
and rip lions in half. It's just
the same stuff. It just
is this really just a story
that, um,
and this is one of my issues that I find with guys
that deny astrothiology
or even, they're like, ah, it's
celestial myth. They don't really care to go into it.
To me, it tells me these are based off
what you're talking about, Michael. What you're
talking about is going to the root
of all of the
origins of these religions.
And that is what I said to Dr. Robert M.
Price in his living room one night. I said,
Dr. Robert M. Price, these myths seem like
they're advanced storytelling of
something more primitive. Something that
was probably more, like, look up.
Alright, you see that? You see this?
We're going to show you the story in the heavens.
And
he kind of looked at me and said, huh?
He wasn't thinking like what I'm thinking
and I, am I wrong in thinking
that way?
No, you're correct.
It probably was a cosmic myth.
I mean, there are a limited number of places where
you would have a monster
or be like Hydra,
Cetus, or maybe even
Draco or something like that.
I mean, this is where it would be.
I'm not sure the details
as to where. I have to sit down
and look at it and see if I can pick something out.
But yeah, I mean, it moved
out about 10,000
BC or so
when they started to
migrate out of the Caucus Mountains.
They moved east
and they also moved north up to Germany
and into the
English-speaking states.
So you had these separate migrations that are going on
and down into India.
And then they also floated down the
Tigris River and connected
with the Semitic people down there.
And
they gave us these myths.
Now, depending on how old the myth is
it would be more how
common. But there's also people, Indigenous people
living in this area, in those areas
that were not part of the
Indo-European migration
so they combined their stories
with the existing ones.
So it's
very difficult to create
you
have to look at the big picture
on the myth
in order to try
to do it with a knife
is going to be well beyond
my capability of doing here.
I'm
concentrating mostly on...
I know where the endpoint is.
I got the endpoint down.
That's the Bible.
That's how they got everything.
And I'm relating everything to the Bible.
And I can take that Bible back
all the way up through
the Bronze Ages as to where
the stories came from.
And I'm looking into Egypt now
from what we've seen.
We've got the enunciation
of Egypt and going back
thousands and thousands
of years. So there's
a lot of
commonality, but
it evolves. It changes over time
and it changes from culture to culture.
And you have to be careful
looking at the stories.
You got to leave
there's too many people using
comparing Egypt
to the Mayans and to
Australia. Yes,
there's some common symbols there.
There's some commonality, but I think
that's more coincidence than it is
trying to draw lines.
Luther?
Back to politics.
Let's look at
the Jews
and their celestial myths
and how that changed
because of certain political realities.
You've touched on this more than once
in the discussion tonight.
But you had
Jews, militant Jews
who were fighting against the Romans
for generations.
And
according to you in your book, many of them
were spurred by the stars.
They believed that the age of
Pisces would see
their rulership
come into play. And it obviously
didn't happen. Rome won.
But you say
the conclusion to your book
on earth as it is in heaven
that there were three outcomes
as a result of this. Some
kept on fighting. They believed
in the celestial myth and okay
this says the Jews are going to be on top.
We're going to continue to fight with Rome.
Others abandoned
the myth entirely.
And now here's the most interesting
outcome. This is the one I want you to talk about.
Some of them
took the astrological
geography that said Judea
is going to be on top.
And they changed that to
astrological
Michael. Can you hear me?
Michael? Michael, are you there?
Yeah, I can hear it.
I missed the three points.
They're your three
points. They came out of your book.
I told you, I wrote this
second ago.
True. Okay, alright.
Alright, you said
some of the Jews kept fighting Rome.
They believed in the
astrology of Pisces and that they
were going to rule. You said others
totally abandoned it. But I want to talk
about that third group. They had
astrological
geography. They thought Judea was going to be on top.
They changed that. It morphed
into astrological anthropology.
They said it's not about
land.
But it's about people. We're not tied to the land.
It's not that we're going to dominate
people from Judea. But it's that we'll
dominate as a people.
That is fascinating.
I want you to comment on that.
How did that happen? Yeah, that was
something that I don't want to
try to do this by sounding
anti-Semitic either. But that was
the idea. They were supposed to become
people of the book.
And they were supposed to be good citizens
in whatever land that they went to
live in and rise to
prominence in those
lands. That was
supposed to be what that
theory
goes on.
That was
their calling.
Now, I'd be willing to also say
that they probably lost
the
cosmic connection
very quickly on that.
They just went on. Just like
Christianity has lost its cosmic connection.
In
looking at something we had
talked about was
the midrash, or midrashium,
plural. It took me a year to
realize that the plural is midrashium
and not midrashes.
And
my word spelling doesn't like
either one.
But
that was written probably up to
about 400 AD
or so.
The Jews, the rabbis
wrote in their stories
that contradicted or
supplemented those in the Bible.
And if you read that
those stories would indicate
that they had a knowledge
of the astrophiology
on which the Bible was based
based on the details
and how they relate them to the
Greek mythology and Greek stories
that are
of the same constellation.
So it seems to me they maintain
this knowledge for
several hundred years after many
have given it up on it.
They know what the origins were
probably as late as
at least 400 AD.
Maybe longer
beyond that, I don't know
when it started to fade out.
And then you get into
your Kabbalah era where
it has a resurgence.
So how much of that
was original? How much
was just added from the
European mysticism?
It's a question
there that you probably
could not be able to answer.
I love this
the thought behind this
because
we've had
John Knight Lundwall
who was a scholar in this field
dealing with the celestial myth stuff
and
he says they went from an oral peoples
to a more literate and you just
verified becoming a people
of the book.
See they were more ritualized in nature
even if they did have text
they were more ritualized and they continued
the ritualization
and with their
I suspect connection to the
celestial motifs and
they became more so focused on a book
they gradually kind of
disconnect plus probably not
being so much of people of the land
so I suspect
that there's a connection between
the land and the
myths and the heavens. Oh I
love that picture.
What do we have here?
What do we have here?
That is from a synagogue
that is
a zodiac in a Jewish
synagogue.
The Jews who don't believe
in astrology or the
zodiac
if you talk to scholars
they will tell
you that
this is
from I'm trying to get my
stuff here.
Oh
anyway
if you talk to scholars
they will tell you that
this was just a common
way of
building temples back then
it was just part of the Greek architecture
and that's why they put it in
those synagogues on the floor
they put these big beautiful mosaics
just because it happened to be
part of
Vogue at the time
and I'm like what
did they get a special deal
on zodiacs that they had to put one in?
I mean
what did this
work?
Buy one get one free.
Now
if you go south
I think it was in Yemen
in southern Arabia
there's a temple there
they don't have the zodiac on the floor
but they have the name of the zodiac
constellations carved in the wall
going around
yeah
so
it's kind of like evidence that
hey there's something to this
and in the middle
you have Helios
the sun god
which is
the sun god which would be represented
of the Messiah or the coming Messiah
that would indicate these were
Messianic Jews
that's my opinion
I like that because
that wouldn't make sense if this was Yahweh
it would be a lunar god
I like how you're... I like that
that's an interesting idea
and scholars who've said
that there are Messianic
or people who are looking for the Christ
a Christ prior to the time
of what we see in the New Testament
here is this possible
1st, 2nd century BC movement
of these Messianic
Israelites
or Jews that might be practicing
all the way down through
this solar
this is interesting
now
I have my own theory on this
and it's a single point theory
and
I'm kind of out of the lunch on it
now I have no evidence for anything else
I am assuming
one of the things that they did back
in this time and all during the middle ages
and everything else was they made amulets
amulets were good luck charms
and they had to make the amulets
at certain
times
there were specific times for instance
if you wanted to make an amulet against a scorpion bite
you had to make it like while the sun was in
the scorpio and the moon was in cancer
maybe it was vice versa
and you had to make it in a specific place
in a specific, you know
place you had to do this
and then you would have to have an incantation
with it and then incantation was
in the biblical scripture
and they would take those incantations
they would roll them up in a little piece of paper
and tie a little string
or piece of leather
around it
and it would be with the amulet
for what they needed and they would
speak these words at a specific time
and place in order to get this thing
to actually work
well it actually didn't work against scorpion bites
but that's how it would work
and I am
I think that maybe the zodiac was
a place where they might have
the holy place
that they would make
form the little clay
amulet
I don't know, I have no other information on this
this is just a wild
single point
very guess
that I have nothing to back up with
so that's why I'm thinking
they were still using these
synagogues
I'm not sure why otherwise
they would use that
yeah
a whole bunch of questions come to mind
Michael, those synagogues are beautiful
one thing is
what's the practical application
I mean as you say, yeah
this is on the floor but was it used as a workspace
was it used as some sort of ground
zero for an observatory
the way the larger temple was
I mean the temple had the minarets
you could actually go up
several stories
and there observed the heavens
but the synagogues were on a smaller scale
so did you have
the same type of
observational concerns
and if so, was that modified
and if so
what part did the zodiacs
on the floor and on the walls
play in that
that's fascinating, we know almost nothing
about the uses, we know that they are there
but
the rest remains to be figured out
one of the things
about the Hebrews
that a lot of people
don't connect them to astrology
is that even though
the whole Bible and stuff was into astrology
they really suck as astronomers
they were not
good at it at all, that was not to
fulfill the expertise
they relied on other people to do their work for them
that was basically what that is
our modern day
astrology was set up
about 800 BC by the Assyrians
before that
whatever constellation
you were in
the constellations are not equal
in size, they are not a perfect
30 degrees
the Assyrians did that, they said
we are going to make each constellation
30 degrees and screw you
Virgo who is like 44 degrees
you are going to lose and all these other constellations
they are going to gain, so they all became
30 degrees
and we are going to make Aries
since Aries is the first constellation
of the vernal equinox
we are going to make it constellation number 1
so when Pisces came along
Pisces was like hey I was 12
I should be number 1 now
he was like nope, Assyrians made Aries number 1
Aries number 1
we are almost into Aquarius, what is it
Aries, still number 1
they set that system up
800 BC
and nobody has
dared change it at all
that is the way it is
now if you are into
astrology that is real
today it is called Vedic astrology
it is based out of India
they are really into that stuff
but I am not promoting
astrology
I don't believe in astrology
I just practice
looking it up
I just love ancient astrology
and how it ties into everything that we did
buildings that we put erected
cities and everything
it was just there and it is something
that modern day scholars have ignored
not only do they ignore
they know nothing about it
they know nothing about the ancient symbols
and they
constantly misidentify stuff
because they don't know it
I gave you one example right here
how they totally misidentified something
that is very important
that is more important
that they find a 7000 year old
Neph
that is
a spider
another one that they had
they had
it was from Iran
ancient Iran
and it was obviously
there was a bull in it
there was a bird
or a scorpio
and then there was the
man I think for Aquarius
so they had these three points
so logically your fourth
point would be Leo
the summer solstice
they had all these other things
well Leo
the fourth drawing on there
was a dog
so the scholar goes oh
that is the dog star
he did not know
that in ancient Persia
Leo was
a dog
and that is because they got this from the Akkadian
the Akkadians
did not have a word for lion
their word for lion
was big dog
ok
the Persians
the Persians got their
astrology from
the Akkadians
that is why they have a big dog
for Leo
they got the actual word
to me that is like a thumb print
as to something in
ancient history that you can look at
and say ok that happened
this is where it came from
but scholars modern scholars
they do not know the ancient constellations
or who had what so they constantly
misidentify stuff in the past
when I described the biblical archaeology
they had stuff in there almost
every month that they
don't know why this is
why is this beehive here
with Ashera
we have no idea what is going on
with this and then the serpents
why are these serpents on this thing
it is like come on
look at the astrology on this thing
I try to break
things down to simple basic
elements
and that is what they do
it is not that hard
it is really very simple
people try to make it complex
all you got to do
is know
the ancient stuff
yeah but Michael
you keep it moving and you are willing
to constantly revise
your theories and I think that is what
makes you successful now you have
these two books out
I have enjoyed them one is
the secret astrology of the Bible
and I am showing that because
mine is a well worn copy
guys but it is what I have
and then the other one on earth
as it is in heaven I have that on gimbal
but I don't have the physical copy
of it but guys they are available
on Amazon they are well
worth you are checking out
I am using it right now
both those books as a resource
in my writings on celestial mythology
and scenes
of a
stellar allegory in the Bible
particularly in the book of Acts
you don't want to be without it
and Michael Lido has
no axe to grind he is not
like Robert Taylor who got put
in jail twice for talking about this stuff
you know what I mean
so he doesn't
have a tip on his
shoulder so Michael
we have enjoyed our time with you
tremendously you have to have you back
on the show
we have to wrap up
this is Bible bloopers
I corrected the stuff in there
and now it is out on this one
skeptics view of the Bible
I go into Josephus
I go into New Testament stuff
I go into
the piezo conspiracy theory
I go into all these different aspects
that is not
in anything else that I wrote
you what
Michael you are holding out on me
I didn't even know about that publication
man where can we get it
Amazon
everything is on Amazon
the original title was Bible bloopers
I would not recommend that because there is a lot of
I got it
from using books
as sources
and where the books were wrong
I was wrong
so I have stuff in there that I say
as fact is actually
for a better word urban legend
and it is wrong
so I had to get rid of it
I had to redo the books
and I retitled it
so this is
going into that
my first one
do you want to do one more here
one more here
yeah of course what have you got
one more thing
one more thing
this is from
a 1650
book
reprint
it is the heavens
and each star
has a Hebrew letter
by it
and this was supposed to have been
they said the Hebrews read the stars
like a book
and by assigning the letters
to it they also said the same about the ancient Babylonians
they read it like a book
and the way it worked
is that each of these
had a letter
and the planets
were the volts
the one from Mercury would be
the A or Alpha
then E or Venus
I, Mars, O, Jupiter
and
you for like the Uranus
thing which is why
Moses which was
Moses was associated with Jupiter
they changed it to an O
because that's what the Jupiter thing
Eve had the two E's
Venus associated with Venus
those are just guesses I can't do that
with everybody in the book
but supposedly they
as the planets
went through the heavens
they would also go through
these different constellations that were assigned
to different nations
and they would make the words up
they would use the words
they would make numbers
out of them
and they could predict
how long an empire would last
that they used this for
prophecy
so this is what they did
in 1650's
when this book was written
it's actually a French book
I got a really bad English translation
but that's
now how long were they doing that
is that something that they developed recently
or is that something they have been doing
since the Babylonians were reading
the stars like a book
I always thought that was kind of poetic language
it was just a metaphor
they read the stars like a book
they actually did
that's really a book
but it's like ok
I do find it fascinating
that
and I've heard this said
the everlasting gospel
so in the New Testament
the story of the gospels
they say is once again
pre-existent
the gospel had been there
in fact Paul acts like the gospel
had been preached to Abraham
so it's like this idea that
the gospel
has always been in the heavens
the story
of the good news has always been told
as a book story in the heavens
I find that to
kind of fit what you're saying in a way
well that's Bullinger
I don't know if you ever read Bullinger's book
he wrote one
there's actually some Christians
that follow Bullinger
I picked his book up
is the New Testament in the heavens
I disagree with what he has found
for both the New Testament
I think it's more Old Testament
but I used his book
basically what he does is
he takes the Arabic name of the stars
and he looks at the nearest
Hebrew word that
would be associated with that Arabic name
and then he uses that
as his basis for that
star
and he translates it into a story
of the New Testament
it's interesting
I don't know
I kind of question his methodology
but I know that it works
in some cases when I was using it
in my Old Testament work
for instance around Libra
it worked very well
where he did that
aspect
but in some places it just doesn't quite work out
the way
I thought it would
we're going to latch on Michael to
the idea of the
constellations being consonants
and the planets being the bowels
we're going to get into
considerably more depth
on this theory
because I think it's just fascinating
that we have you on next time
tell us how
viewers can get a hold of you
that's basically the theory right there
you don't know how much more depth I can go into it
you will be by the next time
we talk to you though
I'm not going to sit here
and try to figure out words
because I'm looking at this picture
the constellations aren't drawn in
so I got no way
to figure out which stars are what
I'm looking at this
I mean heck this could be
you know from another planet
and you know the aliens thought this thing
I had no idea
Michael but if somebody
wants to help
I know what happened to the space aliens
okay
what happened to them Michael
what happened to the space aliens
if you look at the pictures of all
these space astronauts
right with the helmets on
and their garb and everything else
right they're getting ready
they're going out in space
they're not wearing any shoes
hey
I know
they died out
they didn't have shoes
yeah
and all God's children
need space shoes
that's what it was
that's what the song says
all God's children
when I get to heaven
I'm going to put on my shoes
when we get to heaven
or some such thing Mike
we'll be able to be a lot closer
on the meaning of all of this
thanks so much for being with us
do you have an email
hello
hello there
yeah
how do people get a hold of you
Mike
when you finish your task
and make your discovery
by taking your penny pencil
and drawing in some ancient stuff
and make a monument discovery
and you want to contact me with it
so that I can use it in my next book
and not give you any credit
how does that happen
how does that happen
it's a simple email address
it's mikeledo
at aol.com
I've had the same email address
it's 1998
alright mikeledo
LEDO
join us next time
Mike, wonderful having you
we are out of here Derek
you got anything to end with
hope you guys like the show
I really appreciate it next time
we're going to delve into some of the other stuff you mentioned
piece of theory
let's talk about how the stars correlate to the lands
and maybe theories around that
not saying you have all the answers
but it'll be an interesting discussion
it helps us to bring you more shows like this
thanks a lot guys
miss vision, Derek Lambert
Dr. Luther G. Williams and our guest
