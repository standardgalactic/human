The Mormon Church was founded with Joseph Smith as the prophet. In Doctrine and Covenants section
132 it's one of the most sacred areas about marriage and becoming a god with your spouse in
heaven after death and in this section we are going to tell you expose the secrets of what this
is really all about. You're going to want to stay tuned. Gary Stone a descendant of William Clayton
Joseph Smith's best friend wrote several letters letting us know the details surrounding
this doctrine and covenants section 132.
So we'll dive into polygamy specifically around the revelation
that Joseph Smith received and dictated it to William Clayton and he wrote it down
which is today Doctrine and Covenants section 132 in the Mormon scripture today.
So you know as a kid growing up I want to honor my sisters and my family, my sister Susie.
I remember early in my life telling me how concerned she was about polygamy. Polygamy really
bothered her and I can remember like trying to go through section 132 and justify what
132 is really about you know and I wanted to explain that really 132 is about how your
marriage to your husband can last forever and how you'll become gods together in the life
you're after right. So it's this really beautiful thing it's not really talking about polygamy
um and so I want to like apologize to Susie my sister for I don't think her maybe she didn't
feel hurt or she probably didn't wasn't heard by me and others in my family and I want her to
be heard and I want her to hear what we're going to release what really happened with
Doctrine and Covenants 132. Can I add some some amazing icing and cherries on top of this?
I say that to say they've been right and we should have been listening to our wonderful
women in our lives for years so this is a shout out to the women it is my wife who's told me the
Bible right was written by men and that you should really be careful to believe anything man wrote
right this is her I mean I think about how difficult my journey has been it is so much more
difficult for women because they know there's a problem but they can't talk about it and they're
not heard and we're just physically more aggressive and and more in control of what we're gonna allow
patriarchy it really is so dedicated to Susie and and that look I'm gonna keep it real I don't give
a flying you know what about the whole politics this is not political no we men historically
scratch your politics have been running the show for far far far too long and I'm not here to see
here and act like men shouldn't have some I'm making the point like look at the abuse you just
went through about the sexual polygamy going on in the previous episode how manipulative men are
and in that power structure yet they had to hide hide it from other men but the point is because
they were in that position of power they were capable of doing such a thing they had the power
to create the system that oppressed and really made women property yeah and so it's just the truth
it's not political so we're just putting our cards out on the table we say man we've been wrong and
we apologize but it's time it's time that we we also stand in defense of what they've been trying
and try to be a voice yeah and listen so remember William Clayton is in Navu
and the leaders of the church who are involved in political year trying to keep it secret
but they just can't keep it contained right and there needs to be some revelatory you know
thing that that solidifies this most importantly for for Emma because Joseph is at this time trying
to convince Emma by the way she has no clue he's already started it she has so he's trying to
convince her that we need to try this thing out right and these other women are in agreement
Eliza Snow for example but these women and men already knew they weren't already practicing
polygamy and so they're trying to convince Emma of something that they were already doing it's
it's it's so like I feel so bad for her right so but I'm also really impressed with her because
when Joseph Smith would approach her and say well I the Lord thinks that I should be able to do these
things with other women because it makes me happy and she said back to him well the Lord
thinks that I should be able to go get with other men because it makes me happy and she would say
that to him he didn't like that right and he actually kind of would threaten her and you're
going to see here we're going to read from the Doctrine Covenants you'll see where he addresses
that specifically about Emma now Mormons that read Doctrine Covenants 132 will not know if you
understand the historical context of where this section came from you'll understand why he's calling
Emma out the way that he is and I want to point that out it's very important because remember
right up into this revelation he's been getting pushed back from Emma like crazy including if
you're going to do it then I'm going to do it right that's not that's not part of the plan
he's got to put her in check for that right and by the way this is her churches as much as it is
his right she knows that and so Hiram, Joseph's brother and William Clayton is in like a an office
Joseph Smith's office with him they're always together William and Joseph Hiram comes in and
says to Joseph I know how to convince Emma and Joseph looks at Hiram and he's like good luck
that woman is never going to accept like me right and this is all written by William Clayton in
this journal and I'm paraphrasing and Hiram's like no no no no we're going to we're going to address
it in this way we got to talk about Abraham and Moses and and these biblical prophets that had
multiple wives we've also got to talk about how we're going to we can continue our marriage
after this life and and how the you know the New Testament's wrong about you know not being married
in heaven and and so we we've got this broader revelation that will convince her and so Hiram
think he thinks he's got a plan and Joseph's like okay but I don't think it's going to work right
Joseph was right it didn't work but this is where this section comes from and I want to
emphasize this is in Mormon scripture today and it was not because God came down and said this is
the revelation it's because Joseph was getting nothing but resistance from Emma including her
threatening to do the same thing and then Hiram coming into the office with William Clayton there
saying let's let this let's dictate this revelation and then Hiram offers to take it to to to Emma
and that we're going to read that you're okay and William is writing it down this is in Nauvoo
July 12th of 1843 verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph that in as much as you
have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I the Lord justified my servants Abraham
Isaac and Jacob as also Moses David and Solomon all polygamists my servants as touching the
principal and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines behold and lo I am the Lord thy God
and will answer thee as touching this matter therefore prepare thy heart to receive and obey
interesting how they spell obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you for all those
who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same so I want to just pause there there now
imagine you're William Clayton and you're writing this down and that's how Joseph's talking he's
talking in third person he's talking as if he is the Lord but verily thus what what's the very
beginning so yeah verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph right Joseph saying that
right and could you imagine how weird that I just think that would be so odd but William loves it
right writing it down okay sorry no you're fine and by the way I just want to also help our audience
understand this is this is first and foremost an answer to Joseph's question or Hirams I think
this was Hiram's idea why did these really important prophets all have multiple wives and
concubines it's not about raising children under the Lord the section is not about godhood the
section is not about you know having marital relationships beyond this life it's it starts
out with why did these guys get to have concubines and we don't for behold I reveal unto you a new
and everlasting covenant and if ye buy not that covenant then ye then you are that you then are
ye damned for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory so in order
for you to be saved you have to practice polygamy yes this is the covenant for all who will have
a blessing at my hand shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing and the conditions
thereof as was instituted from before the foundation of the world what a wonderful way of making sure
that you this is from god right and as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant it was
instituted for the fullness of my glory and he that receive it a fullness thereof must and shall
abide the law or he shall be damned sayeth the lord god so this was a common theme for Joseph
Smith at the time that he moved from like restoring the church back in kirtland through the book of
Mormon because you will find none of the doctrines taught in navu in the book of Mormon the celestial
kingdom not in the book of Mormon these ideas of polygamy not in the book of Mormon so there's this
whole new era in navu where Joseph's not just revealing the original church of Jesus Christ
he's now revealing the entire fullness of the gospel from the foundations of the world Adam and Eve
and so it gets very big and grandiose and verily I say unto you that the conditions of the law are
these all covenants contracts bonds obligations oaths vows performances connections is this connections
associations or expectations that are not made and entered into and sealed by the holy spirit of
promise of him who is anointed both as well for time and for all eternity and that too most holy
by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed whom I have appointed on earth to
hold this power and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days
and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood
is confirmed so only joseph smith has the power and authority to seal the word is sealed a man
and a woman together in this relationship of polygamy and we still call marriage ceremonies
today a ceiling my wife and I were sealed together now this changed in history because
joseph smith is obviously not here and so who could seal us well later on in church history that
sealing power was delegated off to many others I could see how someone might interpret there's only
appointed unto us so only one so about one on the earth at eight times they would interpret that
meaning at the time it was joseph but at a time so they found a way to loophole yeah but now there
are many many seals because there's many temples got it and I think those there are people including
myself that hear that section like you own your the sealing ceremony it is really special to me
because that's where I entered into a marriage with my wife right so I hear that and I'm like
well that feels good I don't really like to hear about the concubine part but this section I relate
to got it so it says um this power and the keys of this priesthood is conferred are of no efficacy
virtue or force in and after the resurrection from the dead for all contracts that are made
not made unto this end have an end when men are dead behold mine house is a house of do I go next
order sayeth the lord god and not a house of confusion will I accept of an offering sayeth
the lord that is not made in my name or will I receive at your hands that which I have not
appointed and will I appoint unto you sayeth the lord accept it be by law even as I and my father
ordained unto you before the world was so what's interesting about what's happening here is
Joseph Smith is I'm trying to imagine this room where Joseph Hiram and William are together
and all we have from William's Journal is that Joseph dictated this now I can't imagine now
Joseph pretty smart but just like dictating this off the cuff it took three hours and I
could imagine that it may have been collaborative maybe William said something well maybe you know
Hiram said something but just think about what what was happening in that room for three hours and
and all this rhetoric all that language is saying is this marital contract if it's sealed
through this priesthood authority it will be honored in the heavens hereafter I would even
go a step further to add that I also see this as really again authority authority authority
authority affirming god said god said in not Joseph are you hearing god yeah are you paying
attention god is speaking here imma yep you better listen this is not me your husband with
this earthly desires this is god yeah and that's what I keep picking up and and it will it will
continue it in the heavens that's yeah I have not appointed and will and and will I appoint
unto you saith the lord accept it be by law even as I am my father ordained unto you before the
world was I am the lord thy god and I give unto you this commandment that no man shall come into
the father but by me or by my word which is my law saith the lord and everything that is in the world
whether it be order or ordained of men by thrones or principalities or powers or things of name
whatsoever they may be that are not by me or by my word saith the lord shall be thrown down and
shall not forever sorry shall not remain after men are dead neither in nor after the resurrection
saith the lord or god for whatever so for whatsoever things remaineth are by me and whatsoever things
are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed therefore if a man marry him and we're back
to this thing so so I want to stop loving this I'm loving that you are reading like this I thought
this would work and it's working because I have never realized until right now that the reason he
talked with that level of rhetoric was for power and authority yes the priesthood it's god I mean
go ahead with your thoughts I mean this right here if I really believe in god this is the most
manipulative level that I think we're seeing right here and what's interesting is how opposite the
christian the Mormons have made this they are looking at this because it's so divine as if this
is good we talked about how manipulative joseph smith was manipulate enough to talk about you want
him to destroy your father that is that's holy sanctioned stuff he's making up shit to get these
girls to open their legs for his own purposes okay let's keep it real let's keep it real
this is not a private conversation between him and the manipulating a single girl
he's trying to take the manipulation behind closed doors and make it permanent and from god
and to damn nation level okay so he is making a public record in a way of his manipulation
right here to power and control and he knows that people believe in fact we know that people
even when they left and said what a dirtbag joseph smith was still believed he was used by
god to accomplish these things the Mormon yep so the ones who said this guy's not the guy they
still believed in the the experiences they had and all of that they go back to this being the true
movement even with him being apostate absolutely so this the way I'm reading this is he is so
clever and manipulative wanting his stuff to be and it shows a desperate side of him it does
he's so desperate for sex and to get his way with the women that he is literally making god
be the guy he's already been doing that but it's like you do not understand that's how desperate
they want this thing to get out they're hiding the secret that they have to try and find a way to
make it work that's bubbling over bubbling over yeah that's how i'm seeing it it's a power thing
and it's interesting we started polygamy look these are heroes that we know Abraham all that
then god has to go on this long if i have spoken it will you not listen to us if i have not said
if i decreed it do you not listen like and like really almost like he's talking to Job or some
some poetic powerful biblical language here that you're almost like yes lord yes lord you know it's
god talking all of a sudden that's how manipulative this is and then he just gets right back to
about marriage here we are let's continue
therefore if a man marry him a wife in the world and he married her not by me
nor this is so so manipulative goodness gracious
and if he marry her if a man marry him a wife in the world and he he married her not by me nor by
my word and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him their covenant
and marriage is not a force when they are dead and when they are out of the world therefore
they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world therefore when they are
is he repeating this he repeats himself hold on so this is interesting
they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world therefore when they are out of the
world they neither marry nor are given in marriage so he's trying to deal with that jesus
passage he goes that's right but our appointed angels in heaven which angels are ministering
servants to them to to minister for those who are worthy of a far more and exceeding an eternal
weight of glory for these angels did not abide my law therefore they cannot be enlarged but remain
separately and singly without exaltation in their saved condition to all eternity and from henceforth
are not gods but are angels of god forever and ever so he's pretty much trying to argue that
the people he's trying to argue in this marriage thing it sounds like the angels you don't want to
be like the angels right and that's what the bible is referring to right because jesus angels are
not given in heaven right will be like the angels right neither given or taken in marriage and he
actually does his little god doctrine here by saying there'll be angels forever and are not gods
right the ones that are gods are the married ones the ones who are married now i want you to know
an apologist and mormons this is very sacred to mormons even even to me today right because my
marriage i've been taught my whole life is about this whole idea that it makes me and my wife gods
in the life you're after not angels right and apologists will be listening to this and will say
that's what doctrine covenant section 132 is all about the beauty of you imagine you and ryan
will be together forever and you will be gods and goddesses and you will make your own planets and
have your own jesus and all that kind of stuff right and so but you know that this always written
out of a desire to convince emma of what polygamy polygamy not not godhood not not families are
forever together this is about polygamy right and this is where apologists will like don't look at
the polygamist part of this don't look at the man behind the curtain just look at this one part
yeah but this this i'm looking at this one right and in historical context plays a significant
role in understanding this because if you're looking at this and he says married nor are given
a marriage jesus right but our appointed angels in heaven okay well what's so bad about being an angel
i'll tell you what's so bad about being an angel he's twisting it to make it even bad to become an
angel because he says but our appointed angels in heaven which angels are ministering servants
to minister for those who are worthy of a far more and exceeding an eternal weight of glory
who do you want to be you want to serve or do you want to you want to be the far more
exceeding glory you know the person with that also implies those angels don't get to have sex
right but the gods do right for these angels did not abide my law well what law is that joseph
smith polygamy polygamy doing what i'm trying to tell you god is saying right now manipulating
everybody using god as your excuse to get up to come to the system but he calls it a new and
everlasting covenant of marriage it's called a bunch of other things but it's polygamy it's
polygamy so it's clear right here he's wanting his way and he's saying for these angels did not abide
by my law and they'll say if the lord i just said which is about this marriage thing um therefore
they cannot be enlarged but remain separately and singly like you said no sex without exaltation
in their saved condition to all eternity and from henceforth are not gods but are angels of
god forever and ever and again barely i say unto you if this guy like if if a man marry a wife
and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity if that covenant is not by me or by my
word which is my law which is what he's saying right now and is not sealed by the holy spirit of
promise through him whom i have anointed and appointed unto this power then it is not valid
and who he's talking about there is himself yes so it's him speaking and it's talking about god
talking about the only one that can condone these marriages right i have anointed and appointed
into the power unto this power then it is not valid neither a force when they are out of the world
because they are not joined by me sayeth the lord neither by my word when they are out of the world
it cannot be received there because the angels and the gods are appointed there by whom they cannot
pass they cannot therefore inherit my glory from my house is a house of order sayeth the lord god
and again barely i say unto you again it gets back to marriage there's so much emphasis here
he's pretty much saying if if joseph smith does not do it then you're not in and it almost it's
almost like he's even trying to make it to where if you're going to get married period period it needs
to go through joseph smith that's true and that did happen it's still that way today so there's like
in a way it's a clever way of saying marriage at all needs to go through me exactly and so i have the
right i'm the appointed one to say multiple people you can marry more than one and as long as it's
done through me then you're in exactly it's the system so he's already hijacking a normal
what everyone's already been doing institution and now he has the authority according to god
through him in his own voice which means his whole mind is doing this to manipulate it for
his own deeds ultimately he wants to hijack the system and convince others about that that's how
i'm perceiving this so he says um gods are appointed there by whom they cannot pass they
cannot therefore inherit my glory for my house is a house of order sayeth the lord and again
verily i stand to you if a man marry a wife by my word which is my law and by the new and
everlasting covenant i'm reading that and saying my word joseph smith's word joseph smith's law that's
how i'm reading this i know they'll say it is god but i am saying joseph is saying this and it is
sealed unto them by the holy spirit of promise by him who is anointed joseph smith right back at him
unto whom i have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood and it shall be said unto them
he shall come forth in the first resurrection and if it be after the first resurrection in the next
resurrection and shall inherit thrones kingdoms principalities and powers dominions all height
and deaths then shall it be written in the lamb's book of life that he shall commit no murder
whereby to shed innocent blood and if you abide in my covenant
and if you abide in my covenant and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood
it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them
in time and through all eternity and shall be of full force when they are out of the world
and they shall pass by the angels and the gods which are set there in their exaltation and glory
in all things as hath been sealed upon their heads which glory shall be fullness and continuation
of the seeds forever and ever so there's there's the continuation of seeds that they're gonna have
they're gonna have babies spirit spirit children that for other planets but one of the things that's
interesting about you know that that section that you just read is that essentially he's saying
why does he bring up murder it's because people who enter into this arrangement into this covenant
are essentially automatically saved and exalted and nothing they do will stop that from happening
unless they murder shed innocent blood so this is this is a it's a very powerful like
it's like here's your ticket to it's like jihad like someone doing a straight up bombing themselves
to get it instantly into heaven it's an instant it's instant yeah it's an instant heaven
plan so here we are again like which is really manipulative right it's like you if you do this
like if you don't do it you're damned but if you do do it then you will be exalted beyond the gods
and it's automatic right you you you don't have to do you don't have to be righteous the rest of
your life you've just got your ticket golden ticket then shall they be gods because they have no end
therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting because they continue then shall
they be above all because all things are subject unto them then shall they be be gods because
they have all power and angels are subject unto them verily verily I stand to you except you abide
my law you cannot attain to this glory for straight as the gate and narrow the way that lead us unto
the exaltation and continuation of the lives and few there be fun be that find it because you
receive me not in the world neither do you know me but if you receive me in the world then shall you
know me and shall receive your exaltation that where I am you shall also you shall be also this
is eternal lives to know the only wise and true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent I am he
receive ye therefore my law broad as the gate and wide the way that lead it to the to the deaths and
many there are that go in in threat because they receive me not neither do they abide my law
he's making it religious so he wants this to to really get people on and it's central today
marriage is central today to the to the church operates right it's the reason the church today
is so vehemently against gay marriage because it it's this this is what marriage means it is
the law it is the golden ticket to godhood verily verily I stand to you if a man marry
it's all about this a wife according to my word and they are sealed by the holy spirit of promise
according to my appointment and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and
lever lasting covenant whatsoever and all manner of blasphemies and if they commit no murder wherein
they shed innocent blood yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection and enter into their
exaltation but they shall be destroyed in the flesh and shall be delivered unto the the buffeting
of satan unto the day of redemption sayeth the lord god the blasphemy against the holy ghost
which shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the world is in that ye commit murder wherein
ye shed innocent blood and ascent unto my death after ye have received my new and everlasting
covenant sayeth the lord god and he that abideth not this law can in no wise enter into my glory
but shall be damned sayeth the lord I am the lord thy god and will give unto thee the law of my holy
dude he is repeating he is in repetition mode he wants you to know this is god this is god and
it's not that this is god only it's like this is god and he's me on earth and like if you do not
listen to this guy joseph smith who's telling you this um you're screwed you cannot get salvation
this is it right so he's saying um the law of my holy priest priesthood and as was ordained by me
and my father before the world was abraham received with all things whatsoever he received
with by revelation and commanded by my word sayeth the lord and hath entered into his exaltation
and seteth upon his throne abraham received promises concerning his seed and the fruits the fruit of
his loins from whose loins ye are these my servant joseph which were to continue so long as they were
in the world and as touching abraham and his seed out of the world they should continue both in the
world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars or if ye war were to
count the sand upon the sea sure ye could not number them this promise is yours also because
ye are of abraham and the promise was made unto abraham and by this law are of the continuation
of the works of my father wherein he glorified himself go ye therefore and do the works of abraham
enter ye into my law what did abraham do
enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved but if ye enter not into my law you cannot
receive the promises of my father which he made unto abraham god commanded abraham and sarah
gave haygar oh we're getting into the juicy stuff now god commanded abraham and sarah
gave haygar to abraham to wife why did she do it because this was the law
right here let's pause for a second the law go back to the beginning of this entire revelation
if you're wondering what the law is what joseph joseph smith just told you he just told you the law
it's almost like you could interpret this and i don't want to like i know an apologist watching
this is gonna probably not get where we're coming from right but i almost want to read
joseph here saying if you do not do polygamy if you are not giving your husband's multiple wives
then you're not obeying the law that god just commanded you to obey like exactly that's absolutely
true and and what's happening here too is the what that's what was known later in the church
is the law of sarah so that what's being added here is that the first wife needs to be willing
and be part of giving multiple wives and approving the next wives for right and isn't it clever they
went to the bible to really push us it's almost like imagine someone who really badly wants to
own slaves right all right you can go to the bible and really justify your owning of people
really easily joseph smith is finding justification in an ancient book that is showing like
but i just want to emphasize if you go back and reread this um and maybe we'll stick the
link to this in the yes down in the description when he says law understand this is he's telling
you he's queuing you this is really what i mean exactly because he doesn't really spell it out
that explicitly clear till right here i mean it's there if you already know what we know
but he says abraham god commanded abraham and sarah gave hagar to abraham to wife
polygamy and why did she do it because this was the law and from hagar sprang many people
now i could see the apologists leaping on i go oh but that's only so they're probably gonna find
some way to say that law was temporary or something right right this is an everlasting law for the
foundations and it's the only way to godhood so you can see why fundamentalists are right doing
this right and f of the s are doing this so he says um many people sprang from hagar this
therefore was fulfilling among other things the promises with abraham therefore under condemnation
verily i say unto you you may for i the lord commanded it abraham was commanded to offer
his son isaac nevertheless it was written thou shall not kill abraham however did not refuse
and it was accounted unto him for righteousness he's mixing all sorts of passages here he's aware
biblical stuff pretty well abraham received concubines and they bear him children and it was
accounted unto him for righteousness because they were given unto him and he abode in my law
who were given to him these women yes like they are owned yep like they can be given and taken
yep and that's one thing my sister susie would say about this she you know because i would say
well isn't it wonderful that we are gonna you know your marriage to your husband will be forever
and it will make you gods in the future okay that might be cool maybe but what about this part
she would say where these women are given to abraham right right they're owned yeah they're
his they're his yep and and the children are his and the children this is not unlike slavery no
very similar they are his property it was accounted unto him for righteousness because they
were given unto him and he abode in my law as isaac isaac also and jaco and he keep
listing the names you know i mean of the guys oh it goes it yep and none none other things
other than that which they were commanded and because they did none other things and that
which they were commanded they have entered into their exaltation according to the promises
and sit upon thrones and are not angels but are gods david also received many wives and
concubines and also salomon and moses my servants as also many others of my servants from the beginning
of creation until this time and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received
not of me so he really david david's wives and concubines were given unto him of me by the hand
of nathan my servant and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power and in none other
thing and none other and none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of uraya
and his wife the murder and therefore he hath fallen from exaltation and received his portion
and he shall not inherit them out of the world for i gave them unto another saith the lord i
am the lord thy god and i gave who unto others he's basically saying so david was given what
women right wives and concubines they will not be with him in the life hereafter because he broke
this commandment he murdered he murdered and really the other thing he's saying is he didn't take
this uh was it uraya uraya's wife through like it his wife wasn't given to him by nathan like
nathan didn't condone that additional wife right so it's the murder but it's also like you didn't
you were didn't go with your the guy who's the nathan should have given you that so then he says
here i gave all those women to someone else in the life hereafter again these women are just
property right given to someone else right it's again the patriarchy it's so when you
trying to understand where i mean we we can't you and i are not women we don't know what any of
that's like i just want to call that out that this is if you're a woman reading this you you
what would you be thinking about who you are and how these men see you right you are property that
are given and taken uh like like cattle yep he says uh he's pretty much says i gave them unto
another saith the lord i am the lord thy god and i gave unto thee my servant joseph in appointment
and restore all things ask what you will and it shall be given unto you according to my word and
as you have asked concerning adultery verily verily i say unto you if a man receive it the wife in the
new and everlasting covenant and if she be with another man and i have not appointed under her
by the holy anointing she has committed adultery and shall be destroyed she commits adultery
but not him exactly so emma better watch your mouth that's where we're going because she what did
she say to him i won't just days before this i'm going to do it too if she be not in the new and
everlasting covenant which is on board with polygamy that's how this is understood clearly with the
law of told to abraham that we know what that means giving other women to him and she be with
another man she has committed adultery and if her husband be with another woman and he was under a
vow he has broken his vow and has committed adultery and if she has not committed adultery
but is innocent and has not broken her vow and she know with it and i reveal it unto my servant
joseph then shall you have power by the power of my holy priesthood to take her and give her
unto him that has not committed adultery but has been faithful for he shall be made ruler over many
for i have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood wherein i restore all things and
make known unto you all things and do time and verily verily i say unto you as whatsoever you
seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven and whatsoever you bind on earth in my name and by
my word sayeth the lord it shall be eternally bound in the heavens and whatsoever sins you
remit on earth shall be remitted in eternally in the heavens and whatsoever sins you retain
on earth shall be retained in heaven so let's go back to that that that section that i think for
many people just kind of sounds like gibberish like well if if if she commits adultery then you know
but she's not sealed and then you know this and that but if she didn't commit adultery
then she'll be given to someone else right that whole red all that rhetoric it's really
justifying what he had already done so so prior to this joseph smith had already married women and
men had already married women who were married to men already so there were women who were married
and he would send their husbands out to beyond missions in eland and then he would turn around
and marry those women so those women were already married so what he's doing here is explaining why
he could marry them even though they're already married that's why he put that all in there is to
explain away uh some of those marriages that he had entered into where they're not virgins they're
they're already married so how how is it that he could marry them and that's why that's he's going
well beyond biblical text in terms of that yeah because he's he's already done all this stuff like
what we're reading here is it's it's already happened it's a justification it's all been
seen it's unjustification jeez um and again verily i say whosoever you bless i will i will
bless and whomever you curse i will curse again i say unto you my servant joseph that whosoever
you give on earth and whosoever you give anyone on earth by my word and according to my law it
shall be visited with blessings and not cursings and with my power saith the lord and shall be
without condemnation on earth and in heaven he's he's letting so joseph smith is literally
he he can say what is right what is wrong exactly and and it's okay it doesn't matter forever
murder he could technically get anything and he did yeah uh so whatever his word is is
internal justified on earth as it is in heaven he's the peter in a way here you know what i mean
he is yeah um so he says uh for verily i still upon you your exaltation and prepare a throne for
you in kingdom of my father with abraham your father because i have seen your sacrifices and
will forgive all your sins i have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which i have
told you go therefore and i make a way for you your escape as i accepted the offering of abraham
of his son isaac which is like he was going to murder his son and uh anyway so verily i
say to you a commandment i give unto mine handmade in the smith so what's happening here in this
section is joseph smith is talking about well joseph channeling god is is forgiving himself
like you are forgiven joseph you've made all the right sacrifices you're exalted now let's talk
about emma oh gosh and as she is she's saved emma smith your wife whom i have given unto you
that she stayed herself and partake not of that which i commanded you to offer unto her okay so
what does that mean read that one more time yep that is very important verily i say unto you a
commandment i give unto my husband or sorry handmade a commandment i give unto my handmade emma smith
your wife whom i have given unto you that she stay herself and partake not of that which i commanded
you to offer unto her what did he command him to give to her polygamy he commanded joseph
to enter into so he's saying she's not allowed to do this but you are yeah it's simple yeah
because she's already threatened to do it she's already said well if god gave you that privilege
then he can give me that privilege and i'll go get other men and so right here joseph saying nope
she's not allowed because she's already threatened it right right for i many i'm telling you there
very very few Mormons will understand what that really is about without understanding the historical
context what's he talking about there i'm commanding you not to partake of what i've given him permission
to do well it's because she wanted it she and she didn't really want to practice like polygamy
with all these men but she's just pushing back on joseph like if you can do it i'm gonna do it yeah
which a which a strong woman would do yeah i think he's fair but anyway for i did it say at the
lord to prove you all as i did abraham and that i might require an offering of your hand by covenant
and sacrifice and let mine handmade emma smith receive all those that have been given unto my
servant joseph because why does he say that right there because he's already received he's already
been married he already has multiple wives let's see let's see Mormons would say this is the this is
when the revelation was received 1842 polygamy was not practiced before right that's yeah yeah but
anyway and you know uh we know that's not true and he says it's not true right he's sitting right
there i've already been i've already given him several wives except that emma yes he says emma
smith receive all those that have been given unto my servant joseph and all the way back to fanny auger
right and who are virtuous and pure before me and those who are not pure and have said they were
pure shall be destroyed sayeth the lord god for i am the lord that i got it almost sounds
like to me right now and i might be reading something into this that isn't there it almost
sounds like he's saying the people who act like they're they're not committing adultery and that
they're pure and they're not actually participating in this new law that he's describing here they're
really the ones that are going to be destroyed so he's making the point from what i can read here
that if you're saying you think you're pure and you're not participating in what he's saying here
you're not pure you're going to be destroyed what are you well that's that's good but it's it's
not what he's saying and that's only because he's talking about 100 the women he's already been given
okay so there will be women who have said that they were virgins right and that they
that they followed because what he's trying to do is retrospectively
layer in this new law to cover all of the affairs he's had right right and many of these marriages
are these women are married to men right already and they've never told the men right that they're
married to joseph smith and so he's what he's saying is there are going to be some of these women
that are going to say well i wasn't a virgin or i didn't follow this law or or that will say
he never offered to be in a polygamous relationship we just shacked up and had an affair those are
going they they're not telling the truth and they're going to be damned he's basically just
prepping emma to and whoever's reading this that these women that were given to him beforehand
some of them are going to say some shit don't listen to them got it okay um they're going to be
destroyed say the lord they'll be destroyed for i am the lord thy god and he shall obey my voice
and i give it on my servant joseph that he shall be ruler over many things for he had been faithful
over a few things and from henceforth i will strengthen him and i command my handmaid emma
smith to abide and cleave unto my servant joseph and to none else because yeah because she's
threatened to yeah get on with other men but if she will not abide this commandment she shall be
destroyed sayeth the lord for i am the lord thy god and i will destroy her if she abide not in my
law but if she will not abide this commandment then shall my servant joseph do all things for her
even as he had said now what in the world was he thinking okay i mean if he's trying to convince
his wife this is the whole thing is to convince emma yeah this is being written first and foremost
to convince emma that's how that's why that context is also important because what he's
doing for emma is explaining all the previous wives you're going to hear about other women that
have i've had affairs with that are going to say it was an affair don't listen to them right so i just
think to myself like if why would he then go on so far as to say you're going to be destroyed
and and have such an awful threat right i mean he goes to all this length to like make sense of
or justify his behavior and again i mean i know the answer is probably just how manipulative he is
but that's really this is his wife there's something here in this passage that i'm curious
about right here when he says i am the lord thy god and will destroy her we're talking about emma
smith if she abide not in my law but if she will not abide this commandment so this is the same thing
like it's the conjunction isn't two different topics he's still talking about this if she will not
abide in my commandment in this commandment then shall my servant joseph do all things for her
even as he has said what are those things i don't know i don't know either and i'm wondering if he's
made threats to her and he's let her know like i i'm telling you what's gonna happen i think he had
i think that that did happen when she said she'd get marry other men i don't know if it's a death
threat i don't know if it's curses he's hoping happens i'm not sure if he's saying if you don't
do this it's actually gonna end up worse running in it with way more women than you even imagine
because listen to what happens right after that this is why i'm wondering in a real argument in
real life because i've been through them with my wife and they've had these arguments right and this
sounds like some stuff's going on yes real drama so he says um then show my servant joseph do all
things for her even as he has said and i will bless him and multiply him and give on him a hundred fold
in this world of fathers and mothers brothers and sisters houses and lands wives and children
and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal world and again invariably i say let my hand servant
her handmade forgive my servant joseph his trespasses and then shall she be forgiven her
trespasses wherein he wherein she hath trespassed against me and i the lord thy god will bless her
and multiply her and make her heart to rejoice and again i say let not my servant joseph put his
property out of his hands list an enemy come less than enemy come and destroy him for satan
seeketh to destroy for i am the lord thy god what property is he talking about the the wife women
yeah so that sounds like a threat conversation that he had of like if you do not get on board
what's going to happen is you'll be cursed and destroyed and and god's just going to manifest
hundredfold right if you don't like it now you're really not going to like it when it really
comes down that seems to be the argument terrible yeah imagine talking to your wife like that
and threatening her with many many many more children yeah i'm going to have so many kids
that aren't even by you that's how it sounds like you're not even going to be the one in which the
seed is going to go on it's going to be and these three men in this room they're like talking about
this and william's writing it down not one of them said you know we're going this is a little rough
let's soften it if we've tried to convince her right it just it's just amazing to me you kind of
imagine um i wonder how often he had tried without getting this far many times with her i imagine
yeah they had already talked a lot about it and this was the last attempt and hyran thought this was
hyran thought this was a good idea probably because the men really do have yes the say so
that's the only reason that i think this is even a solution to say same work yeah he goes on to say
i am with him as i was with abraham thy father even under his exaltation of glory now as touching
the land of the priesthood there are many things pertaining there unto very uh verily if a man be
called of my father as was erin by my own voice and by the voice of him that sent me and i have
endowed him with the keys of the power of this priesthood if he do anything in my name
and according to my law and by my word he will not commit sin and i will justify him
justify all of these things they're doing with these women let no one therefore set on my
servant joseph for i will justify him for he shall do the sacrifices which i require at his hands
for his transgression sayeth the the lord or god and again as pertaining to the law of the priesthood
if any man espouse a virgin and desire to espouse another and the first give her consent so the first
wife is now going to have to give consent for any new wives right this is this is a new pattern that
hasn't existed before got it okay so in a way i think he's throwing emma a bone i think he thinks
that's what he's doing okay you you get to decide on all new wives and that is what he tells her
okay this is interesting okay so if any man espouse a virgin and desire to espouse another
and the first give her osan which says consent brackets and if he espouse the second and they
are virgins and have vowed to no other man then then is he justified he cannot commit adultery
for they are given unto him for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongs unto him and to
none else and if he have 10 virgins given unto him by this law he cannot commit adultery for they
belong to him and they are given unto him therefore is he justified but if one of either of the 10
virgins after she is espoused shall be with another man she is committed adultery and shall be destroyed
for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth according to my commandant
and to fulfill the promise which was given by my father before the foundation of the world and for
thine exaltation into eternal war worlds that they may bear the souls of men for herein is the works
of my father continued that he may be glorified and again very very i say unto you if any man have
a wife who holds the keys of this power and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood and
pertaining to these things then shall she believe and administer unto him for she shall be destroyed
say the lord your god for i will destroy her for i will magnify my name upon all these who
receive and abide in my law therefore it shall be lawful in me i mean how obsessed how obsessed
you have to be to go to this length this length he these three men i imagine all three are that
desperate yes they are you know and and i'll just say are we at the i think we're at the end
yes that's it okay so all right so yeah finish it i think that's important i will magnify my name
upon all those who receive and abide in my law therefore it shall be lawful in me if she received
not this law for him to receive all things whatsoever i the lord his god will his god will
give unto him because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word and
she then becomes the transgressor and he is exempt from the law of sarah who administered
unto abraham according to the law then i command is so he's exempt from which law the law of sarah
so he doesn't so the law of sarah now and now newly revealed is that the first wife gets to
choose all new wives unless she you know emma doesn't comply then he can he doesn't he can do whatever
right okay she doesn't she doesn't have the law of sarah anymore so it's like the law of sarah
doesn't matter got it i commanded abraham to take hay guard to wife and now as pertaining to this law
i'll fairly fairly i say unto you i will reveal more unto you hereafter therefore let this suffice
for the present behold i am alpha and omega amen okay now all right derrick so oh my god so so so
when you understand that historical context and again this is william clayton wrote that
dictation and pre that dictation wrote the whole context about how it came about that's
i'm not making that up that like hyrum comes in and tells joseph i know how to convince emma
you're gonna you're gonna receive this revelation i mean william writes all of that down we know
that that's what happened right we understand this context william clayton's the one that
wrote down the story of emma threatening to marry other other men i mean he this is the
documentary evidence if we're using documentary hypothesis on your channel that's what we're
talking about here i this is not anti-mormon rhetoric this is not some my interpretation this
is what is written in these contemporary diaries and then so hyrum takes this document and he
takes it to emma and i don't know why hyrum thought it would be better for him to do it than not joseph
so hyrum takes it and says the lord gave us this revelation how do you think emma responded
do we have documentation let me ask you that we do we have william clayton kidding me okay um
she's pretty feisty dude if they fought this long let me put it like this i'm guessing because i don't
know you're literally getting i'm putting you i'm a virgin right now yes this is fun um so based on
what i have seen in that and my assumptions from my own experience my arguments in the past with my
wife when we weren't you know doing good in our relationship stuff like that we're young dumb
things like that um she did not she was not going to be pushed over i'm gonna tell you uh this if
anything you effed up a a ron you done messed up now okay and i would imagine that she's like
bullshit exactly so what's interesting to me about that is that this is where i go back to
my own hypothesis about emma feeling that this is her church as as much as it is joseph's right
because she was with him from the very beginning again one of the first scribes of the book of
Mormon was emma so she didn't look at that and believe that god revealed anything she knew exactly
what that was it was joseph writing bullshit for her that and so she ripped it up and threw it in
the fire and higherman came back and told joseph and william clayton this is what happened and
joseph said i i told you so and and what's what's and i i know that that's the reason i
want to emphasize that is because Mormons today believe that every single section of the doctrine
covenants which is our scripture it's part of our scripture it says it's as important to Mormons as
the bible and the book of Mormon and that those revelations were god talking to joseph but we
so i just want them to understand the context behind how that was written doctrine and covenants
132 today was joseph's attempt to bring together all of his past polygamous marriages justify
them under you know a commandment from god and convince emma that this is a good idea and emma
who is as close to this church as anyone else developed the church she's she's building navu
quite frankly looks at this and she knows it's bullshit she does not think to herself or recognize
this is revelation from god right now there might be other women that would right i think any other
woman that might receive that letter might think he's getting a revelation from god but why didn't
emma and this is a question i'm just asking rhetorically and maybe you want to answer it but
why wouldn't emma know or believe at least that this came from god but that it was just joseph
i mean i would imagine emma in some way emma sees the frailty of him and doesn't see him on that
level everyone else might i would imagine um maybe she thinks god's used him in some way maybe
but she's not buying this whole thing she sees all the dirt she sees all of that's going on
and she sees that she's being manipulated in some way so she's got a lot of street smarts i would
imagine um so i'm curious about how much she really even believed in any of this revelatory
stuff because you know she recognized joseph can have a revelation well so can i and that happened
frequently right she would say well you can have revelations from god why can't i
and so it makes it just makes me curious about like um how they together their relationship
and how they formed the church together and what was she thinking when he was dictating the book
of Mormon and and was she a willful participant in this pious fraud and i don't know if pious fraud
is the right word for this but she she was she was part of this this whole movement and knew
she knew full well joseph's bullshittery is my wonder i think so i would imagine and it wasn't
to her benefit too so there's that that normal natural what the heck which is also why isn't it
emma that like once joseph's dead is there's a splintering where yeah and i think a lot of i think
a lot of members don't quite understand that either they think that joseph died and immediately
brigham young became the new prophet and that was the right succession plan but truthfully what
happened is there were no leaders the church went leaderless for probably a decade and then you know
brigham young took over the church that went to utah emma continued the church in navu and really
emma believed that the church had passed to joseph's next you know living son and at that time his
living son was like 13 and so they had you know it wasn't until he was in his 20s that he became
the prophet of the of the you know real church of jesus or the reorganized church of jesus christ
of latter-day saints under emma that stayed in in navu but the other thing i want to mention is that
this because navu was so powerful in the in the united states the united states was seeing this
influence of Mormons in navu abraham lincoln was either i think the senator or governor at the time
of navu or about billinoy before he becomes the president joseph actually went and met with abraham
lincoln to say why can't we why is polygamy being illegal it infringes on my religious liberty right
my religious doctrine dictates that i have to practice polygamy that's another reason for that
revelation because now it proves that this religion's doctrine is polygamy and we shouldn't
enact any laws in this country that stop them from you know doing something that they believe in
he he implore and abraham lincoln even told him when if i become president i'm gonna fight for you
which that didn't happen but that that's what a claim joseph claims but eventually marriage then
for the country became an issue Mormons made marriage a national legal issue
before then i don't think that there was a like constitutional thing at all at a national level
about marriage and and if it was governed in any in any way it was at the local levels right
and so it was so ironic to me that when gay marriage started to come into you know limelight
in the in the uh 2010s um that the church vehemently fought against this the church didn't
like that that there was going to be a constitutional right for gay marriage and yet it was the church's
fault that marriage became a national issue in the first place and what they wanted was multiple
wives they wanted a non-traditional marriage too and yet it's that very same church that then says
well gay marriage is not okay and and it's just the irony is uh sweet i don't know yeah in the this
goes back into an old thing we've already mentioned just in this video you can see
how unfair and how not okay this whole practice is for women um but i would imagine like the
same goes for slavery like so what you can find ancient precedents for things what do you do um
a lot of that ancient stuff is not good we have come to realize this now we are stopping things
that were once practiced as a regular thing so we if anything it's almost like we need new
revelations and i'm not talking about divine ones necessarily i'm saying why don't we learn
what is the least harmful in the in in most fair across the board um so that this is like my aim
and my goal right and i'm with you i like this i mean we're talking about people who are of same
sex marriages they got a problem with that no wonder they got a problem with that i had a problem
with it when i was a christian i was like what's wrong no this is not how god made you know this
and that and it's like whoa but of all christian denominations that should that shouldn't have a
problem with that it's the christian denomination that started its whole existence with non-traditional
marriage like this is the this should be the church that would be like let us practice polygamy you
guys go ahead and practice you know your form of marriage but this is the one christian religion
that having non-traditional form of marriage that you know obviously did a huge pivot and
joined the rest of the christian denominations on uh banning gay marriage or or being anti-gay
there's so many things to me walking away from this if i were a Mormon and i actually heard this
and it wasn't and i wasn't being hit with cognitive and for those Mormons watching Derek we read from
Mormon scripture today right directly from doctrine covenants 132 not from you know uh
anti-mormons or scholars we read directly from scripture that is in the church today
that if i found that out i would be forced for the couple options in my mind i mean there's a
couple different ones i could come up with but i would imagine either i would disagree with you
trying to act like this is some negative thing toward Emma or that they had previous fights or
whatever i try to divorce the historical context right and and accept actually polygamy you know
everybody this is very important and maybe we need to bring this back you know what i mean like
and some do right that's right that's one option um there's multiple options we still do practice it
though i'll just tell you so and i said this yesterday too but like if i were to only we
practice it in the spiritual world still today okay right so if i did lose my wife i could get
sealed to another woman and i would be sealed to both of them and so it's almost like a look we'll
save she couldn't do the opposite she couldn't so this is like a saves you the headache of dealing
with this world but we're gonna have it in that we still have it in that world right it's still it's
still a doctrine in the world you're after so they're still keeping it in a way it's still there
so there's that sense in which i would say no it needs to be brought back period okay
if you're a restorationist then yeah well if you're reading this and you're taking his word
seriously and you believe what he's saying is true then yeah i would be like forced to say
polygamy's right the prophet spoke like unless you wanted to say this was satan uh but if you did that
you're really screwing yourself if you're a believer because if god can speak so thus say
if lord over and over and over from this man's voice what else is satan well yeah so what an
apologist would say is a new prophet later on wilford woodruff received a new revelation
called the manifesto that discontinued this okay that's kind of interesting and new and ever lasting
law from the foundation of the world that you're going to say you serp the early one and if we
investigate the historical context of why that new prophet has come up with a new revelation
i imagine the real world is coming down on this practice to a point where they're forced to have
a revelation with the united states wouldn't let utah become a state that's really what was
happening and at first there was a first manifesto that joseph fielding smith put in place a prophet
that was fake right so we did it for the federal government but they were still practicing it
when they were caught so then there had to be a second manifesto from the next prophet wilford
woodruff i think that's how it worked but there were two manifestos we no wait the second manifesto
i think was joseph fielding smith i'm probably getting those names in a way we didn't we didn't
fully just disavow this until the 1900s early 1900s so long story short is that they're clear
non-spiritual motivators yeah yeah and this to me would be like all right the later prophets
are full of it if i thought joseph smith was our guy you see what i'm trying to get at those manifestos
they do keep an opening an open door for we still practice polygamy in the life hereafter but we'll
follow the law that's basically what the manifesto say right i just have a hard time believing when
i read that joseph smith was clearly saying that if you don't practice this law yes this law
that joseph smith is saying if you're not practicing that and some what many apologists will say is
well we do we we get married through in a temple yeah i mean that law though that law is that sarah
i mean that is the giving of the hay car it is the law of sarah you're right yeah and repopulating
is the command be fruitful multiply if you're not obeying god's commandment here of like
literally practicing the law of sarah then you're not actually obeying the law he's describing here
the law he's describing here is polygamy if you're not practicing polygamy that's why i wanted to read
it that's why i wanted to read it because if you read it and you have the historical context
that's the law and we're fooling ourselves when we pretend that it's just marriage it's more than
yeah yeah i think that yeah because imma shows up over and over and over and like marriage this
marriage and it's all about marriage and it's all about this thing going on between the man
allowed to do this but the woman not and then it's their argument you can see their argument playing
out in that section it's quite interesting and her yeah i know it's fascinating it's like a jerry
springer it is um it's really interesting yeah so i would be forced to either try to recognize
what's going on here if you really confronted me with this or as you can see apologists you've
already pointed out are gonna do all sorts of stuff to get away from it and that's what
every a whole bunch of gymnastics that do it in every religion i deal with islam christianity
Judaism you name it depending on the kind of person practicing Judaism um but i'm looking
at this going the other option is damn it's just a guy that's my sister susie that's her
realization there's a third option and it's my dad my dad does this ignores it will not talk about
polygamy because it is so upsetting to him so he's still very faithful goes to church every week
but will not pay one i couldn't do that completely put it in a closet yeah i'm weird meaning i like
to know what the what the truth is and i need to know what's the facts and i need to get into the
details because it's dishonest it's yeah it's dishonest if you're not knowing what's really
going on wow so in conclusion in conclusion the church was fully and completely at least by
the time they got to nabu based on and centered on polygamy and polygamy just became everything
that the church needed to be and brigham young continued that in utah and so when we when we
hear prophets today in our church disavow polygamy say it was a hundred years ago no big deal why are
we being asked about it it's because it was a big effing deal to the members of the church they
defended it with their lives so don't pretend that it wasn't a central component of Mormonism
and just getting back to your beginning testimony when did you see this and know this like i know
you knew about it but like when did you really digest what were what we read today and understood
it with what you understand now it was really reading william clain's journals fully like
like really reading all the the excerpts because they're not all in one place so you have to you
do have to like study them and and find where the different excerpts are but when you want you
and that's really what i did and i actually did that in preparation for one of my youtube videos
that i did on polygamy and it was it was actually a little bit painful and embarrassing because i was
like william clain i mean this is my my ancestor we we have uh artful proclivities in my family
that probably came from him to a degree like he was a singer and a and an artist and and he was
intelligent and was a writer i mean many traits that me my siblings have right so i wanted to
find something positive about him and it's very disturbing to like really like read what was going
on and just if any of that was happening today yeah we there is no doubt we would call it a cult
we would call it bullshit and and and it would and these men would look like absolute
misogynistic fools that were creating a power system that gave them fantasies that made their
fantasies come true i'm king david and i have many wives and concubines that's what i found
when i was reading his journal
