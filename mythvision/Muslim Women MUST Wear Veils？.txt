son do you want to know what the truth is after this there's no turning back you take the blue pill
and you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to you take the red pill and you stay
in wonderland and i show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes remember all i'm offering is the
truth nothing more
awesome awesome derrick i love that intro it's banging thank you thank you i'm gonna have to
hook you up with my buddy jonathan sheffield he's like amazing with cartoons he's a great guy
and i'll have to hook you up um let's apologize to the audience because what happened was we had
to unbler her photo and it took us so long to unbler it that we finally got it right and now
we can go live isn't that right yeah guys we were having technical issues which actually means we
were using a software to try and unbler my face uh so you apologize right no um on a serious note
so this this the guy that you debated i want to call him a radical fundamentalist
muslim and he he stands for everything i don't in so many ways um i just want to point out
this is his channel and this is his thumbnail that he literally put on his channel for his
muslim audience because well why don't we let you because you know what happened during this
debate that made me really feel like okay this is not how we're going to let things roll you
didn't get to talk about the things you wanted to talk about he guided the whole conversation
he kept stepping on you during cross-examination so um why do you think he did this well first
of all i think that daniel's i was so derrick to be honest i was a bit shocked in general that daniel
wanted to debate me because he's the one who goes on like on twitter and stuff and he says
unless you have this much of a platform or a following who you know you don't even like
get onto his radar to be debated against so i think his intentions to debate me were more like oh
there's an ex muslim who claims to be a feminist as well let me kind of go in to demolish and
destroy in the words of daniel's following so i think his intention was to come there and obviously
try and make it you know some of his debates have been so iconic and people have created memes out
of them and i mean no matter how bad he looks his intention is always to you know try and quote
and quote destroy the other person or their credibility so i think that's kind of the
intent that he went in with and then his arguments well because i anticipated like what's he gonna
say to you know kind of defend the veil but his arguments were very much like i said an appeal
to history appeal to tradition um looking like cherry picking this is the problem with daniel
he cherry picks things from a certain point in history or random studies and he just uses them
to fit with his argument um so yeah the most the first like the thing that honestly my my
intention was just please don't lose your cool with this guy so when he the bar was so low derrick
i was like just stay calm but um when he kind of started to brush off uh what happened with
masa anini and you know her death and just in general like things that are happening in in
iran and afghanistan that was kind of the first low blow when i was like you're trying to whitewash
what most of us have heard and seen horrifically as the way that she died uh so again it was an
emotionally charged debate for me in the sense that he is saying things that are just so like you
know just obviously untrue yet there are girls around the world who are being killed in the very
name of what he says so some people had to go at modern day debates as well but like for saying
why do you platform somebody like daniel um and their position is like no matter how crazy the
ideas are we just want to kind of get them out there which i also you know i don't know i i i i
think that is kind of it has a good spirit to it it just when daniel can be saying like can
be saying these things without any pushback and he gets more and more airtime it is scary but
you know i had like his army of muslim trolls come be unleashed on me but
the pushback has not been so bad well i'm looking at it and he has so many views and i i hope my
goal is to get some of our audience to go subscribe to your channel i mean the video you
posted the same video he has and we're gonna show something just for everybody before we get even
started into the discussion you got 3.8 thousand views right we definitely need to help grow your
channel and go support what you're doing there he had 170 thousand i mean 7.5 thousand likes and if
you look at the nonsense in the chat um i don't know how to spell out like i hate this woman uh
you know more like they are so angry that you had a voice and i've heard you guys i love you too
well yeah we want we want to see you you know succeed in getting your voice out there because
i think you're gonna have a lot in common today i felt like he also blurred your video um i've
heard because he wants to keep his muslims from possibly being um fallen to sin over lust or
something and you're not wearing a head covering right so look at what he did for everybody look
at what he did to her video this is what took him so long to get on the stream he pixelated her video
where you can't really make out much i mean it's it's all this is ridiculous and this is the kind
of stuff that you know is encouraged in his community so we are in a ideological warfare in a sense
against bad ideas i also have your twitter up i hope people will go and subscribe you on twitter
it's neria k uh at neria k and then you have the youtube i want to hit refresh at the end
to see these numbers grow that's my goal so let's come back and see these grow you're one of the
few supporters that i am a member of the youtube channel in support of what you do because it's
hard enough being an ex muslim for real and then being an ex muslim who's a female that just adds
more icing on the cake so i'm following your lead and whatever you feel is on your chest you
want to get off you want to discuss i'll follow it and then if you want we can take super chats if
you're okay with that like question super chats whatever during the stream yeah sure no first
of all uh derrick you are always like you always plug my channel and everything so i just want to
say thank you so much um you really care about increasing my viewership and i like it comes from
such a good place so i really really appreciate that uh but yeah please do go ahead and check
out my twitter and youtube as derrick was saying um but yeah i guess we can kind of go into first
of all what he did there was like somebody mentioned the comments it's literal erasure that's
what he was trying to do because we know like a woman's stature in islam anyway so daniel does go
by you know islam how it should be in its real sense and uh yeah that it's so true he definitely
thank you inclusive line for that super chat um but yeah not exactly derrick so so his he's
doesn't shy away from admitting mainstream like what islamic values are so that was like point
blank you know debating somebody that's trying to erase you and not even treat like a human being in
the very first place but yeah moving past that um obviously his argument like i said derrick do you
know about christian roman history where women were forced to cover to that extent that women are
forced to cover in in islam i don't know exactly when in history but i do know head coverings was
encouraged even in the new testament so it wouldn't shock me i would imagine there's probably somewhere
in the heber bible as well um and the the logic behind this if anyone investigates the whole reason
it's in paul's letters is or at least i think it's in paul's letters or it's in one of the epistles
because there's all sorts of different voices that are going on here one of them literally
sees women as baby making machines so if you reproduce that is your way to salvation if you
don't reproduce good luck as a woman but in this case it was cover your head so angels don't come down
and and rape you so it's like the weirdest but i imagine there's obviously control behind
the very notion as well as well but i don't know in history when that was enforced
yeah no exactly and to be honest even though it was like encouraged and you know it happened in
various empires in history it was never done in a way that in a perfect islamic state that it would
be mandated in the sense that you would get killed for two strands of your hair showing
and the kind of main point that i was trying to distinguish was that in islam the hijab and the
veil is there as a marker to just doing distinguish between uh believing women and and non-believing
women i.e slave women who you are free to molest and rape um so there's that huge distinction as
well at play um and daniel like again he just glosses over these massive flaws in islam and
kind of again just cites these studies there in the moment that you can't fact check um
but yeah daniel do you mind just one second sorry i'm not feeling very well could i
absolutely here i'll um so while she's doing that i will uh see what's going on here yeshua the king
good to see you in the chat again yeshua wake up to islam and realize that the ideology that needs
to be exposed not christianity i think mrs kahn would agree maybe some christian groups but not
christianity i think we might have i mean what do we talk about when we say christianity i would
have to i would say that christianity period why not expose it if it's false and if it is harming
people if the idea of people going to hell or how they live their lives in some way is affected
negatively typically what i see happen though is that christianity evolves to people's ethics and
their moral standard so that they have made it pretty and we see this also i would say with some
forms of islam so you're getting modernized versions that aren't as bad and to me if you're
going to be a true christian you're going to take up your cross and go to martyrdom you're
going to do anything and everything to follow and be like christ and i think it was wasn't it
nichy who said there was only one christian whoever was and that was jesus or at least one
jesus himself was the only true christian um but for me i'm going to expose anything i think
is false and um i i get that there's more harmful ideas that might be in radical forms of both
christianity and islam that need to be addressed but i would imagine this is my thoughts just saying
this to you i know that you're a christian so of course you wouldn't feel that christianity would
need to be criticized or or or picked apart um i'm not an ex-muslim i am an ex-christian and so
my expertise of knowing what i know would be particularly on that subject however keep in
mind i have friends who are christians we disagree but they are my friend what i don't find i i do
find radical christian fundamentalists they view you as an enemy like personally whereas in islam
there's a lot more people who view ex-muslims as enemies it's like built into the into the framework
so um they have it a lot harder and with that being said i definitely stand against these
kind of things so uh i'm trying the best i can to be balanced and be fair but if it's bad i'm
going to call it out and if i think it's not true i'm going to call it out and that's what i think
also of christianity so i really appreciate the support and the super chat i hope that answer
solves that problem and nary is back here we go sorry about that that's okay sorry derek i'm not
feeling too well but i'm going to try and push through this okay um yeah so i missed that last
thing you were saying on the super chat that you always comment on it sure we'll comment and keep
rolling um yashoda king was saying wake up to islam and realize that that that's the ideology
that needs to be exposed not christianity i think miss con would agree maybe some christian groups
but not christianity and i just simply said that like if it's false if i don't think it's true
i'm gonna i'm gonna pick apart there are prettier versions of it there are lovey-dovey
messages there's things you can learn in christianity and i would even go so far as to say maybe even
in islam that you can walk away and go there's some value to this something to learn does that mean
that i couldn't pick it apart or you know anyway but your personal thought as an ex-muslim and
engaged in the world you probably see islam as worse i don't know what are your thoughts
yeah no 100 first of all what you said is like yeah that you know okay so basically what i
stand right now is that christianity has been pacified over the years it is nothing like what
it was once upon a time and it's not it's not got that forceful power behind it i think if christianity
wants to come into power today you see glimpses of traditional christian values being employed at
derrick in your country in america and it's it's kind of scary you know like even roe v wade and
all the things that are happening with that but women having to fight for their most basic
fundamental rights in 2023 because of fundamentalists in christian bible belt america so again
christianity is also problematic in its very nature but what i was saying is basically that
you know over the course of history the printing press exposed and pacified christianity people
started to read the bible in a language of their own and think you know what there's so much bs in
this like it might be good for you know us to kind of keep on our bookshelf and go to church once
in a while but we're not going to enact what what this teaches whereas islam is very much going
through that phase at the moment so again it's the age-old thing since the advent of ex-muslims
that we are saying that what the what the printing press did to christianity the internet is now doing
to islam um but yeah yeah i'm not sure if you've heard that before derrick but it's really relevant
because um as you can see like the wave of our sex muslims on on youtube and all the other platforms
that i'm not even privy to but the pushback is now like i would never derrick i would never have had
the time or the the wherewithal or cared probably that much to go to a local imam or cleric and a
mosque and like read these hadiths and you know like read like to the the seer which is the commentary
on the the verses of the quran but now at my fingertips i can just search like all like the
major commentaries i compare them and highlight them in a moment but this was all inaccessible
that quran was very much the the book on the shelf but sorry to answer super chat i completely
agree islam is the need of the our religion that is is kind of the most fundamental threat to it
it's fundamentally poised against human rights so it definitely does need to be exposed
yeah i i see the threat with christian nationalism and stuff if you need to if you need to like
disappear and you do i'll just be like popping me back up and then i'll but this is about you
i really want to give you the platform so i opened an article before we came here and
feel free to run in the middle of talking opened an article called he job no more a phenomenological
study and i was looking that up on google and i was thinking to myself holy smokes like no wonder
when girls who are forced to wear it and you were at one point maybe you can give a little
testimonial of your own personal experience wearing he job and then you find out like i don't
have to wear this and in fact you you found freedom there there there is a sense of reaction
that takes place there but what daniel is saying in this debate is that this is a necessary like
he tried to use evolution to try and like argue against you on this whole point the evolution
that he doesn't believe in supposedly you're right there's a lot of cherry picking here because
evolution right it's the survival of the fittest whatever is the fittest in the environment that
it's in but like as if he found a moment in history you know what we were sacrificing humans at that
time you know we should we should go back to look at how many civilizations across the world
sacrifice humans the mayans did it completely divorced from what was going on in egypt and what
was going on in the middle east and what was going on over here we need to go back to
sacrificing humans right naria not not just that dirrick bring it all back bring back slavery
bring back even the burying your first newborns especially female newborns like
again this is just most basic appeal to tradition which again is not it just because something has
been practiced over time and for the longest like time in human history does not mean that we need
to bring it back if anything the whole see we come from a different perspective in terms of
our morality right daniel thinks that we can we we don't even have a moral compass because our
morality keeps changing or progressing but he is using islamic morality to cherry pick
appeal from tradition case studies in history and by doing that he's imparting that half of the
population is basically considered less unveiled and he is even acknowledging that like men like
yourselves derrick are the problem so instead of you not controlling yourselves it's on us
to be able to have to do that so we can we can go into how problematic that is as well but
yeah also just like on your point about hijab that my slight difference in all of this is that
it was actually a personal choice of my own nine-year-old nuria wanting to be that good muslim
who gets to heaven thought oh if god wants this then let me do it so in my case it was weirdly
peculiar because i was actually being encouraged to take it off which rarely happens yeah wow but
you when you lived now you were married at one point i'm sharing your testimony right you were
married at one point and you were in what where were you did they like did you have to wear hijab
when you were there what country was i i was in dubai when i was married in the ua e so you don't
you're not you don't have to wear uh like you don't have to cover your head there many emirati
women or muslim women choose to wear the abaya but where i lived in saudi before that it was uh it
was like obligatory for you to cover your hair especially when you kind of hit puberty i'd say
like around like you know 12 13 you're you're expected to wear it and you have to wear the
abaya regardless when you leave your house right so yeah um which is weird because i had done it
voluntarily in england and then i moved to saudi arabia where it was forced and again it just the
natural aversion in me was like why are they forcing it was okay when i did it myself but having
to know that you have no choice it kind of you know it does few things a lot i'm just gonna give
my two cents here and then i'd love to get your thoughts naria i see the hijab as i get its tradition
i understand that but i do see it's it's a weaponized form by a religion which is patriarchal
nature like through and through that literally subjugates women and sees them as property i
mean literally that is what a woman is in this religion they are the man's property um and that
hijab is weaponized against women um the whole time you debated him while i thought that i also thought
the only reason he would defend this and you're gonna hear my saying and then people in the audience
i think are gonna connect the dots they can have up to four wives you can't have up to four husbands
now of course i would say that they probably try to argue other reasons behind this but it's like
well the men are the ones who work and have the money and like if they can afford to take care
of more women they're actually helping these four these three other women if they already married
like you can't tell me this is not like completely built and made for men this is what it's all about
yeah a hundred percent i mean like if if islam gave women you know the same kind of fundamental
freedoms where you can marry up to four men it would be a different story but like i'm sure you
know we see in Mormonism or anything else like when when there's polygamy it's always there for the
man to enjoy it's it's never the the other way around uh and not just that but again you you've
got your one of four wives a lot of Muslim women have i'd say it's like inherent Stockholm syndrome
where they are they they kind of justify it but then you ask them if they'd be happy to be one of
four and they get disgusted at the very thought if again you want to apply to like you know appeal
to sorry our biological nature or our tendencies i wouldn't necessarily go as far as to say like we
are all built to be monogamous i don't think that's necessarily the case but i don't think one-sided
polygamy is you know in the best interests or biologically even accepted by women in general
so yeah you can completely tell it is you it's made by men for men and then for me the origins of
the veiling verse uh where it came from and the reasons behind it um i will go into that in a second
Derek give me one second i'll be back yep yep yep all right so i'm gonna oops wrong one here we go
bear with me i'm gonna give another shout out to her on uh subscribe to our youtube channel we're
gonna refresh this at the end i did pin it at the top of the chat and um let me come back to me for
one second here uh we got a super chat i'm gonna i'm gonna get to your super chats here just a
minute i'd like to have Nuria also answer these with me because to be honest with one of them
um i don't know as many she would be more aware of some of this material in terms of anti-islamic
groups and stuff and uh i'll be getting to those i hope everybody is having a wonderful day and uh
please like the video go subscribe to our youtube channel and let me know when you have press one
if you have subscribed to Nuria's youtube channel how about that in the meantime while we wait on

i know i really appreciate that derrick sorry i'm not feeling good but i did not want to pass up on
a stream like this especially when you're giving me this like the platform to say all of this i
i hate that i'm feeling so awful but i'm gonna continue um yeah i just want i just apologize
to your viewers as well i'm really you don't have to apologize just you're fine trust me
everybody loves it so you're good don't worry we're just here to support you honestly oh i really
really do appreciate that um but yeah again derrick just to touch on i'm sure you might have heard of
it in in passing in some of our conversations but the origin of the the hijab is so embarrassing
in islam like when i realized thank you see everyone's being so nice in the comments thank you
everyone um when i first heard about it i was shocked like i didn't you know as a muslim woman
i thought okay this is a commandment from god or whatever but having looked into the islamic
origins in history of it got worse like one of uh derrick one of muhammad's companions umar
would actually like he he was he was one of the worst i'd say like out of the four rightly guided
caliphs he was the most kind of misogynistic sexist violent um so he would conduct like these sexual
raids in the evenings where women were really vulnerable and um he would do that in a in an
area nearby what was called manasi which was like a field where muhammad's wives would go and like
relieve themselves and answer the call of nature and um umar was out there one day conducting one
of these sexual raids and he noticed one of muhammad's wives who was a tall lady called sauda
and he had been wanting the veil to to come anyway for some time and muhammad wasn't really into it
and then he yelled out that day when he saw sauda bless her just relieving herself and he goes oh
sauda like i've recognized you and poor woman was so flustered by that as well she like went home
and told muhammad and then he goes oh yeah okay maybe maybe the verse of bailing shouldn't be
revealed and after that umar goes as far as to in the hadith boast about the fact that Allah
listened to him when it came to three things and one of those things was bailing so that's just
sparked so many questions in itself yeah i mean i heard this before but i'm glad you said it for
the audience it's like can you imagine an entire system of of something like this is starts from
women defecating in a field and getting seen by men so the men are like oh watching your
woman defecate well we need to cover these these women of ours and make sure that they're not like
seen they can't see their body um it's pretty crazy and how it's been used against women is also
wow i could imagine someone trying to like argue against the hadith or the traditions and stuff
to just hold on to to the quran only now i understand there are some good arguments to point out later
traditions are made up maybe even for the people but like are you with me and i'm sure you have
muslim friends that are more progressive or quran onlyist or something that are that are
like trying to find a way to make this balanced but are you with me and saying like do we really
even need the quran like like what is the point if you're doing all of that oh oh 100% also like
Derek just to just to backtrack a little bit that question sorry that story of the hijab
raises questions as to the creator of the quran itself like it can you really say that that's the
word of god transmitted by the angel gabriel sorry by Muhammad uh through the angel gabriel
because if umar if his words have gotten in there then that kind of it you puts the whole of the
quran into question then it puts all of the islamic claim into question so you're on very dangerous
ground but yeah i would agree with you there's there's so with with veiling it's very tricky i
wanted to know obviously i thought daniel would just take the mainstream approach but with veiling
for example there's so some people go as far as to say like it's not even in the quran at all like
it's not mandated and then there's other people and obviously when you look at some islamic states
wherever islam is in power it is mandated so the overarching consensus in islam is that veiling is
is mandatory Derek imagine oh go ahead go ahead you can hear me you can hear me i i guess i don't
know let me wait let me wait just in case um i really appreciate everybody being patient obviously
nervous not feeling good right now and uh i'm gonna go ahead and jump up here to these super chats
that's what we'll do we'll get to the super chats and then we'll go from there and uh that way i don't
leave everybody hanging here let me see hold on did i pass one oh here we are okay so starting
we'll be starting with you Zachary and we'll work down through the super chats and continue to
continue to move forward but for me i mean there's a lot of apologetics i see going back
and forth in defense of trying to you know make your religion palpable to modern ethics and what's
going on in the west or anything like that and fundamentalists who have all of this tradition
and writings on their side are like you know clearly have the upper hand in many ways of trying to
argue a lot of this stuff against those who are trying to make a pretty religion and might like
for me a lot of people went why did you go from fundamentalists to becoming an atheist like
isn't there a transition why didn't you just become a liberal christian for many many years or something
for me when i recognize that bubble popped i did start to transition but eventually like i was like
is there anything and i wonder what that takes for someone who's in islam like a muslim to
then do the same thing with their religion is it the same is it the same kind of experience that
i did when i was a christian who thought the bible was god's word and fallible or an errant and all
of a sudden you just bubble pops and you start to realize like maybe i don't even know if there is a
god at all because one might go well christianity why didn't you check that or why didn't you check
judaism or whatever um i'm wondering what that process is like for the x muslims which is why
interview x muslims i think lots of the lots of people have been critical of like why do you
interview them they're not experts not everything i do is a phd on meth vision like that's not my
thing um i'm interested in hearing people's testimonies their stories i relate to people
who've left cults and uh neria when you get back just pop on let me know um i am uh just gonna make
one more comment about Mormonism i just had a buddy of mine who is a descendant of william
clayton who is a scribe of joseph smith and the entire religion i can't speak the same for
islam to know but like the entire religion of Mormonism it's like foundational one of the
pillars to it you take the pillar the house falls down it's not one of those where one pillar can go
is polygamy and it's all about the man's wishes the man can have several wives he called it spirit
marriage and i see a lot of overlap between what joseph smith did in Mormonism and what i'm hearing
and seeing going on in islam so big questions to ask darik i'm so sorry i'm back i i'm gonna try
i'll give it one last push but yeah i apologize you don't have to apologize i promise you we're
we're here hanging out waiting on you no worries i really really unless you feel so bad you need
to go and we want to blast through these and do another follow-up i mean we can i don't want to
force you to do anything that's the goal of this show oh gosh okay uh let's see how i go um and if
if we need to do a follow-up we can but let me try and get through our discussion on these
Zachary uh thank you so much for your super chat i'm sure Derek's already answered you
also Derek that stream um on Mormonism was was bloody fantastic like thank you could honestly
i was eye-opening for me i love looking into these religions that are as i i want to just
use the word loosely but as totalitarian as islam um it is just so like to see the parallels are
just it's like wow it really makes me be able to humanize Muhammad more because i almost see like
a modern-day replica of him whether it's like you know in joseph smith or uh the founder of satan is
a sorry satanism uh science Scientology right or whatever it's like these extraordinary men who
just claim to have like this like this direct command or conversation or knowledge from god
normally we're looking back to like jesus and Muhammad telling us to do these things so
that was really really interesting but yeah Zachary um would you consider anti-islamic
movements to be racist motivated or anti-theist motivated that is a very very great question
um i think it depends who's doing the commentary on Islam for example you can get factions like i'll
speak just in the uk context here for example we've got we had the edl they've uh since changed
their name but it was the english defense league who naturally are like a far right english uh
nationalistic party and they were very much against islam so um uh some of their like
tommy robinson is one of them most like outspoken members and he would you know go hard against
islamists and you know in national debates and stuff but he was not arguing from a position
where he thinks oh let me argue or talk about islam because it's detrimental to society
he was coming from a very racist perspective uh so in like i mean he would probably lump in
Sikhs and muslims and let's say anyone from the subcontinent maybe you know the that racist that
you don't even know whether you're indian pakistani bangladeshi what are you they're just all brown
people who need to be out of arbitrary kind of thing so so it depends who's doing it for example
when when somebody asks me if i'm being racist or tells me i'm being racist because i'm talking
about islam i like to throw it back in their face and say islam is not a race and muslims are not
one race why there's there's indonesian muslims there's african muslims there's muslims from all
over so those two things that that's again a non sequitur you can't you can't be racist by calling
out islam islam yes it's you know written in the qarashi arabic and it does advocate for in a sense
like arab supremacy and arab expansionism and and i'd say arab colonialism and imperialism
but in itself it's not a race uh so in terms of like the ex muslim movement i'd say that's an
anti islamic movement but i definitely would not like to think that we come from any any quadrant
related to race it's purely because it is a antitheistic but first and foremost anti islam the
message of islam movement wow okay thank you zachary for the super chat that's why i needed you to
answer it because i didn't know i don't know much about the movements that are there i do know that
there are some people who come across kind of only within it with a negative driven agenda everything
has to be ugly instead of kind of fairly assessing all the information in my opinion and i keep my
eyes on that docus says wasn't hijab imposed because some creep followed prophet's wife when
she went outside at night to answer nature's call yes that's exactly why hijab was imposed
which is what i mean like a lot of muslim women again like the lollipop fallacy and stuff uh you
know flies get attracted to uncovered lollipops muslim women have become so desensitized and so
comfortable in their position as derrick mentioned beautifully earlier as property in islam i also
like to say a woman in islam is like you're just constantly an infant you are a glorified child
for the the entirety of your life but a lot of muslim women would defend this and say it's like
one of the most beautiful things to have happened and how much it protects them and it's part and
parcel of respecting women but when you look at just the basic origins as for me i find i found
that embarrassing as a muslim woman i i had second hand embarrassment when i realized the origins of
the hijab but it's a shame that's why one of my first videos derrick was to try and like you know
show women where it actually came from because maybe if we can look at the historical context
and almost ridicule it it won't it won't it won't mean so much anymore it's just it's just a cloth
but it has become like a veil of oppression if we realize how stupid slash how dark slash how
you know already uh sexist and perpetratory behavior that was occurring for umar to even
ask for this to happen it kind of would make a i'd hope it would make a woman think twice which
woman would advocate for that happening to poor sauda for its wife so much has changed in the
world too i mean i don't know there's so many things to get into but i don't want to keep you
too too long in case you end up having to go critical faculty in the house hanny good to see
you here hanny great to see the brilliant neria and thanks derrick for all your hard and honest work
thank you hanny it's nice to see you as well um i will hit you up on twitter i know we we need to
talk uh but we'll do something for sure soon but thank you for your support subscribe to critical
faculty seriously again he's back he job is a slap on the face of humanity both women and men
oh yeah 100 agree with that i mean for me like derrick you tell me as well but like for me it
makes me think that it even kind of says to men like you have zero control you're you're beyond
evolving and you you know like it's kind of like yeah men are that weak that we need to cover up
just so they can keep it in their pants like are you guys that weak derrick no i look as a man and
i consider myself like coming from that hardcore military background we have passions without a
doubt they're passions and we have thoughts and these are this is complete i talk about this all
the time with my deconversion and one of the things i struggled with was pornography and the struggles
throughout the years of like uh am i god's child and that kind of stuff this sin that i had
never once was i like i need to go and like take this woman because she if anything i would like
go in private and probably like think about these things and then lust in my mind but like the act
upon the people who would act upon these things or do those kind of things that i mean i'm being
absolutely transparent here like if you have to go out of your way and have people covered because
you're just too no i mean i've heard statistics that muslim countries that are literally ruled
with the law of islam if you or that that's how they do things like saudi arabia or whatever
have like higher pornography rates than other countries and you go why is that do you have
to wear a hijab on your internet browser because like what is it that's making you do these things
i think we all have it in fact the next super chat touches this weird coming from a christian but
doesn't a nudist community prove the hijab isn't necessary to keep people from rape lust etc i don't
know about lust in the mind but and not everyone thinks the same way you know and i consider
myself someone who has pretty good testosterone like so it's like why would you you know i don't
know i don't understand yeah and and derek sorry i think we are gonna have to cut this short i'm
really not feeling good i apologize um i'm we please we can like do a follow up but i it's
not fair to the audience as well if i know i don't want you to suffer here um but i did also
want to say like in terms of the pornographic rate you at that point is bang on if you look at
countries like even the islamic republic of pakistan it's got one of the highest
porn consumption rates in the world but not just that derek like the the categories of porn that
they search are some of the most like heinously barb like just horrible like you know that they're
searching up bestiality and things like that so that is meant to be an islamic country where
women are already barely seen in public sphere but yet the men the teenage boys are there and
they're looking at people you know having sex with goats and things like that because they're
that far gone from from women anymore but i think this is definitely something we need to deep dive
into that's so we need to look i gotta let you go but gray says do you think it's wrong to share
images of muhammad on the internet on purpose i don't think so but i also don't purposely go out of
my way to like create cartoons to try but then again that's not my that's not my uh not my agenda
but what are your thoughts same i i think i absolutely do it it needs to be done especially
when uh teachers are being you know forced into hiding and people are being amped like having
their uh head cut off in in france and stuff because of this like absolutely it needs to be
done we need to desensitize uh the muslims for themselves about not taking lives over a cartoon
but as derrick said first of all i am an ex muslim and i'm already vocal and my life is kind of
already on the line so just for safety reasons i don't also don't go out of my way to do it but
every time i have caught myself putting like a picture of muhammad even as a thumbnail it's
other people who have stopped me and said whoa whoa whoa are you sure you want to do that and
i've just kind of reigned in but as derrick said i i already vocalized so much about islam
i don't go out of my way to do it but uh the people who are putting it out there i'm very
much behind the need to desensitize muslims yeah we're letting you go i just this is i don't want
to leave anybody super chat hanging and i'm going to refresh it anyway just to see how many subscribers
what's your favorite piece of abrahamic literature oh that is such a good question because i've not
read them all um the quran i'd say is probably down there with one of my the worst um but i
i still have to get through some more of the scriptures to give you some feedback i'm sure
there's some books uh as part of the bible which i've heard of very very good like like derrick
there's some that are way more uh like realistic and fun than than others right so i'd love to
like look i read axe maybe or one of those in more detail just to get a feel for what's what's
going on there's all sorts of crazy stuff out there and yeah anyway grace thank you so much for
that and neria we're gonna refresh here i'm gonna go ahead and pop it up and we're gonna get you
out of here so you can go and recover i i hate that you're sick and um i know that that was one
of the reasons you weren't here earlier so i didn't see much of an increase it was 15.4
let's hope after the stream there's more um let's plan let's plan another follow-up and actually
go through maybe some of the arguments that we didn't cover in this debate yes definitely uh
fahti and other people in the chat are saying please do a part two i promise you will do a part
one because i i understand i realized this wasn't even a proper part one but yeah i'm just i'm not
feeling very well so i will go thank you all for putting up with me and sorry derrick for for kind
of making more for an in and out stream but i i will do a proper uh rundown on this with you thank
you she osis i'm not forcing her there's no compulsion here okay thank you neria all right
everybody hit this subscribe to neria all right son do you want to know what the truth is
after this there's no turning back you take the blue pill and you wake up in your bed
