Beneath the sands of time and the layers of ancient text lies a mystery that has puzzled scholars for centuries,
the lost gospel of Q.
Today, we embark on a journey through the enigmatic realms of early Christian texts,
where the whispers of a forgotten gospel echo through the corridors of history.
The gospel of Q, an elusive and mystifying document, is believed to hold the keys to understanding the very foundations of Christianity,
yet its secrets remain locked away, its voice silent until now.
Enter Dr. Dennis MacDonald, a maverick in the field whose groundbreaking work must the synoptics remain a problem.
Two keys for unlocking gospel into textuality challenges the paradigms of biblical scholarship.
With insights missed by others, Dr. MacDonald offers not just a glimpse, but a guided tour into the heart of this enigma.
His approach sheds new light on the tangled threads of the synoptic gospels and the elusive Q,
unraveling mysteries that have long been tightly wound.
But Dr. MacDonald's Q is not the standard Q of academic discourse.
It's a document twice as long, rich with layers of meaning and historical context,
which he prefers to call by its original title, the Logoi of Jesus.
This is not just a variation, but a revolution in understanding.
A new way of seeing an ancient text that could change everything we thought we knew about the early days of Christianity.
Why does this matter?
Why should the lost gospel of Q or the Logoi of Jesus stir our curiosity, ignite our imagination, and demand our attention?
The answer lies in the very fabric of our understanding of history, religion, and human belief.
Solving the puzzle of Q is more than an academic endeavor.
It's a quest for truth, a journey into the past that shapes our future.

Welcome to the enigma of Q.
Who put Q in intensive care?
The two document hypotheses.
Over a century ago, New Testament scholars made two important discoveries that pointed to the existence of a lost gospel,
that consisted largely of sayings attributed to Jesus.
The first discovery was the priority to Mark, to Matthew and Luke, both of whom used it as a source.
The second was the recognition that many of the sayings in Matthew without parallels in Mark
appear also in Luke, often with more primitive wording.
This strongly suggested that the Lucan evangelist received them not from Matthew, but from elsewhere.
These Matthew-Luke overlaps against Mark required a scientific explanation.
Did the authors of Matthew and Luke know similar oral traditions and independently record them?
Did they copy from multiple similar sources, or did they know a unified gospel?
More than a century ago, many scholars chose this last solution
and developed a methodology for isolating the influence of this gospel elsewhere, Matthew and Luke.
It came to be known as the two document hypotheses, 2DH.
The two sources for Matthew and Luke were Mark and a lost gospel, Q, from the German word Kvele, source.
Its most likely title was the Logoi of Jesus.
You can see two source hypotheses on this graph.
To isolate Q, they set out to remove from Matthew and Luke every vestige of Mark and influence.
Furthermore, on the assumption that Matthew and Luke redacted Mark and Q independently,
scholars privileged the wording and sequencing that seemed to be more primitive,
sometimes Matthew and sometimes Luke.
One might call this phenomenon oscillating priority.
This sifting for Q required the painstaking application of criteria
for determining the relative priority of Matthew to Luke or of Luke to Matthew, often within the same verse.
The resulting reconstructions of Q, of which there have been several, thus are scientifically eclectic and useful.
This is the case, for example, in the most highly regarded reconstruction
by the International Q Project and its critical addition of Q, C-E-Q.
The greatest strength of two document hypotheses is its demonstration
that the Matthew and Luke and evangelists knew a lost gospel in addition to Mark.
Early on, however, several scholars noted that even when one expunges from Matthew and Luke,
every vestige of Mark and influence, the resulting reconstruction still contains many parallels to Mark.
These are particularly visible in doublets, replications of the same saying twice,
because it appeared in both sources.
Here is a textbook example of a Matthew doublet.
She commits adultery.
Matthew 5, 32, and 19-9.
Everyone who divorces his wife, except in the case of fornication, makes her commit adultery.
And whoever should marry a divorcee commits adultery.
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife expects for fornication and marries another commits adultery.
Luke 16-18.
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery.
And the one who marries a divorcee from her husband commits adultery.
Scholars routinely recognize Luke's priority here to both Mark and Matthew.
Mark apparently added the prohibition to wives divorcing husbands.
And Matthew twice added an exception in the case of a wife's fornication.
Advocates of two document hypothesis thus use Luke's version for their reconstructions of Q.
If so, the Matthewian evangelist redacted version in a lost gospel known also to Luke as well as the version in Mark.
In other cases, Matthew and Luke avoided duplicating content from Mark and the lost gospel by conflating similar sayings into a hybrid.
Here is an example where Matthew does so.
The redaction of Mark is in bold.
Its parallels with Luke are underlined.
Insofar as Matthew could not have known Luke, the underlining flags wording from another source.
Mark 4-30-34.
And he was saying, how should we compare the kingdom of God or what parable should we apply to it?
It is like a sea of mustard, which when sown on the earth is the smallest of all seeds on the earth.
Yet when it is sown, it rises up, becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches
so that the birds of the sky can nest under its shade.
Matthew 13-31-32.
He presented another parable to them by saying, the kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard,
which a person took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the greatest of all shrubs and becomes a tree.
So that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.
Luke 13-18-19.
Then he was saying, what is the kingdom of God like?
And with what am I to compare it?
It is like a seed of mustard, which a person took and threw into his garden.
And it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.
On the one hand, doublets and conflations confirmed that Matthew and Luke likely knew a lost gospel.
In addition, to Mark, score one for the existence of Q, how about it?
On the other hand, it potentially is inconvenient to two document hypotheses
because Mark, too, apparently knew the same lost gospel.
For this reason, many Q proponents have departed from the mainstream
by insisting that the Mark and evangelists, too, must have known the lost gospel.
Unfortunately, these advocates for the modified two document hypotheses, M2DH,
fell to take Mark seriously as a third witness for constructing Q.
Therefore, their reconstructions are nearly identical CEQs.
Mark thus does not get the attention it deserves.
A pathology one might call Q's mark and deficiency anemia,
but it was not this condition alone that put Q in intensive care.
More damaging is the growing recognition among other scholars that Luke knew Matthew.
One telling example should suffice.
The Matthew and evangelists created much of his story of Jesus' birth to fulfill biblical prophecies.
The so-called formula quotations give his narratives biblical credibility.
In other words, the author most likely created narratives to fit the citations
instead of finding appropriate citations to match the narratives.
If so, when one finds parallels to these Matthewan episodes, also in Luke,
it strongly suggests its reliance on Matthew.
Here are three examples of this phenomenon.
Jesus was conceived by a virgin, the Annunciation to Joseph.
Took place so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled.
Behold, a virgin will conceive and give birth to a son,
and they will call his name Immanuel, which translated is God with us.
Here is Luke's equivalent.
The angel Gabriel tells Mary.
You will conceive in your womb and birth a son and will call his name Jesus.
And Mary said to the angel,
How will this happen since I am not sexually experienced with a man?
Scribes told King Herod that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem.
For thus it was written by the prophet as follows,
And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,
You are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,
For from you a ruler will emerge who will shepherd my people, Israel.
Here is Luke's equivalent.
Joseph too went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth into Judea,
to the city of David that is called Bethlehem.
Jesus began his ministry near the sea.
He went to Capernaum by the sea in the region of Zebulon and Naftali,
where he took up residence so that what was said by the prophet might be fulfilled.
Land of Zebulon and land of Naftali rode by the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
The people who sit in darkness have seen a great light.
For those who sit in the region and shadow of death, a light has risen.
Here is Luke's equivalent, spoken by Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist.
Through the bowels of the mercy of our God,
The dawn from on high will look upon us to shine on those who sit in darkness,
And the shadow of death to guide our feet in the way of peace.
These three examples by no means exhaust Luke's secondary parallels to Matthew.
What makes them exceptional is that these Matthew-Luke overlaps issue not from shared traditions,
but most likely from Luke's reappropriation of content invented by Matthew to match the biblical citation.
What put Q in intensive care is the detection of two document hypotheses to D.H.'s most obvious melody.
Luke's Matthew intolerance.
Is it time to pull the plug on Q, the Far Hypothesis?
Advocates of so-called Far Hypothesis, FH, have been the most vocal critics of 2DH and M2DH.
That's two document hypotheses and modified two document hypotheses.
For this very reason, according to them,
Matthew-Luke overlaps could issue from Luke's knowledge of similar oral traditions,
multiple sources, or a combination of both.
More significantly, what appears to be Luke's priority in Matthew-Luke overlaps
often is nothing more than his crafty makeover of Matthew.
Furthermore, the doublets in Matthew and Luke could issue merely from their fondness
for sayings that they had seen in Mark.
Not all advocates of Far Hypothesis deny the existence of a lost gospel,
but they are dismissive of any reconstruction of it on the basis of oscillating priority between Matthew and Luke.
Ironically, both atheist and Christian apologist go further than Far Hypothesis
and call for pulling the plug as a mercy killing.
The strand of atheism, self-described as mythicism,
worries that if such a lost gospel did exist,
it could be used to confirm that the Jesus too existed.
On the other hand, for many Bible-believing Christians,
any suggestion that the followers of Jesus would have suppressed the earliest narrative witness to him is unthinkable.
For both groups, the absence of any physical scrap of Q means that it never existed, groundbreaking cure.
The Q plus Papias Hypothesis
Here is a visual representation of the Q plus Papias Hypothesis plus Mimesis criticism.
Starting with the materials that we are discussing, which help us solve the problem.
We see the Greek Bible or LXX and Homer, which plays significant roles in the development of the gospels.
The LXX influenced all of the gospels, including the lost gospel Q, Mark, Matthew, even Papias and Luke Acts.
Homer's Odyssey and Iliad influenced the authors of all the gospels and Acts.
But as indicated by the arrows, less so with Q and Matthew.
As they had much larger influence from Scripture, Papias most likely wasn't influenced by the epics.
The lost gospel of Q influenced the synoptics and Papias.
In chronological order, we have Q, then we have Mark with Matthew next and Luke and Acts last in this order.
Papias came before Luke Acts in chronology.
So here is the big picture of the entire synoptic problem mapped out with dates for the gospels, Papias and Acts.
Dennis McDonald says,
In 2012, I published two shipwrecked gospels, The Logoi of Jesus and Papias's Exposition of Logia about the Lord.
In 2019, I published a sequel from the earliest gospel Q+, to the gospel of Mark, solving the synoptic problem with Mimesis criticism.
My Reconstruction of the Logoi of Jesus, Q+, also informs my 2022 synopses of Epic, Tragedy and the Gospels.
The studies defended in detail the solution to the synoptic problem that I named the Q+, Papias Hypotheses, Q+, PAPH, and its alternative Reconstruction of the Lost Gospel.
All three books are highly technical because of the complexity of the topic.
After all, the synoptic problem has resisted a solution for nearly two millennia.
More recently, I published another book targeted primarily for Q skeptics that develops an argument not only for its existence, but also for a more reliable reconstruction of it.
Must the synoptics remain a problem?
Two keys for unlocking gospel intertextuality.
Be sure to grab a copy of this book as it is the most recent cutting edge development solving the synoptic problem.
And this documentary is only a highlight of all that I go into for that book.
Again, what follows here is a reshuffling of the arguments made in this book, Treatment for Luke's Matthew Intolerance, Transplants with Reverse Priority.
All four solutions to the synoptic problem addressed thus far, 2DH, M2DH, FH and Q+, PAPH, hold to Mark and Priority, and Luke and Posteriority, which one might diagram like this.
Mark's first, Matthew's second, the longer arrow going down to Luke means Luke was written after Matthew.
The chronological sequence thus is Mark to Matthew, then Luke.
One thus might use the angle bracket symbol, as you can see, to represent the Mark's relationship to Matthew as Mark with the bracket angling toward Mark, Matthew.
That is, Mark is chronologically earlier than Matthew.
But a careful comparison of these two gospels reveals that often Matthew's wording is more primitive.
It is older in many places.
Ergo, Matthew with the bracket toward Matthew to Mark.
The same pattern holds true for Luke, whose chronological relationships to Mark and Matthew are.
Mark comes before Luke with the bracket pointed toward Mark, and Matthew is before Luke with the bracket towards Matthew.
But in dozens of examples, Luke's wording issues from an earlier stratum of tradition.
Luke with the bracket toward Luke has earlier material than Mark, and Luke with the bracket toward Luke has earlier material than Matthew.
I call this recurrent phenomenon, reversed priority.
Or to simplify, this means there's material that is actually earlier, though this gospel came after.
To assess the relative priority of one version of a saying over another, scholars apply variations of the following criteria.
Independence with the bracket toward independence, narrative contextualization.
When one version of a saying stands on its own, it generally is earlier than one assimilated into a narrative context.
Difficulty, embarrassment, or ambiguity with the bracket towards that earlier than improvement, meaning they're going to approve it later.
When one version contains a problem, it generally is earlier than one without it.
Later texts tend to solve problems rather than create them, to enhance Jesus' stature rather than to diminish it.
Atypicalities with the bracket toward atypicalities, typicalities.
When one version displays characteristics typical of an author's style or viewpoint, it generally is secondary to one that lacks such telltale traits.
Reverse priority of Luke to Matthew, with Luke having older material than Matthew.
The most powerful treatment for correcting Farer Hypothesis' diagnosis of Luke's Matthew intolerance is evidence that more often than not,
When Luke shares content exclusively with Matthew, his version displays more primitive wording.
Here's a list of examples.
Numbers preceded by hashtags identify the location of the parallels in synopses of Epic, Tragedy, and the Gospels.
For those wanting to take a deeper dive, be sure to grab a copy.
You can follow these numbers in that book and find the examples.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is emphasizing examples from the Gospel of Mark that also appear in Luke,
but Luke's version is more primitive, meaning it's older than Mark.
This is Reverse Priority, capitalized by Dr. Dennis R. McDonald.

To this list of Luke's reversed priority to Matthew,
one might add examples of Matthew's reversed priority to Mark.
This list could be expanded.
Those listed here suffice to that even though
Matthew conservatively redacted Mark,
he often preserved earlier wording from elsewhere,
potentially from Q.

These lists show that even if Luke knew Matthew,
he must have known a lost gospel with more primitive wording.
Perhaps the same gospel that could account
for Matthew's reversed priority to Mark.
If so, the damage inflicted by far hypothesis advocates
of Luke's Matthew intolerance is treatable.
But Luke's reversed priority not only salvages
most of Matthew Luke overlaps included in CEQ.
It also adds Logia to the lost gospel.
Let me provide one spectacular example,
which scholars have universally ignored.
Reversed priority of Luke.
Luke has older material than Matthew and Mark,
the sinful woman.
Thus far, I have said little about Papias of Heriopolis
or his exposition of Logia about the Lord.
But in Eusebius' survey of the largely lost five volume work,
he makes the following enticing comment.
It included,
A tale about a woman who had been accused before the Lord
of many sin.
A tale that the gospel of the Hebrews contains.
Lamentably, nothing more pertinent to this famous story
has survived either from Papias or from the gospel of the Hebrews.
In any case, Papias could not have inherited it
from that apocryphal gospel, which was written later.
Furthermore, Papias could not have known it from Luke's story
of the contrite woman in 736-50.
Not only because his gospel too was written later,
but also because Eusebius surely would have made note of it.
Meaning, he didn't know about Luke's gospel at all.
He only mentions Mark, two versions of Matthew.
Of course, the bishop of Heriopolis could have known
the episode from one of his many living informants,
but there is compelling evidence to suspect
that he knew the story from one of the three gospels that he knew.
One attributed to Mark and two to Matthew,
one of which was likely the Logoi of Jesus.
Insofar as the story of the sinful woman
does not appear in Mark and Matthew,
it is appropriate to investigate if it appeared in Papias' lost Matthew.
In other words, did Papias know the story from the Logoi of Jesus?
This question is one of the most interesting
and important questions one can ask about Hugh
and merits more attention here.
Our quest begins with a Matthew-Luke overlap,
where the Luke inversion displays reversed priority to Matthew,
meaning Luke knows of an older idea than Matthew.
In other words, even though Luke knew Matthew,
in this case, he apparently relied instead on a source shared with Matthew.
In this case, the reconstruction of Hugh in CEQ is spot-on.
To what am I to compare this generation?
And what is it like?
It is like children seated in the marketplaces,
who addressing the others say,
We fluted for you, but you would not dance.
We wailed, but you would not beat your breasts.
For John came, neither eating nor drinking,
and you say he has a demon.
The son of man came, eating and drinking,
and you say, Look, a person who is a glutton and drunkard,
a chum of tax collectors and sinners,
but wisdom was vindicated by her children.
After this logion in Matthew,
one reads that Jesus is a friend of sinners,
only if they first repent.
Then he began to denounce the cities
in which the majority of his miracles occurred,
because they would not repent.
What a friend they have in Jesus.
In Luke, however,
soon after the statement about Jesus being
a chum of tax collectors and sinners,
one finds his version of Jesus's anointing
by a profoundly remorseful woman
who publicly displays her repentance.
What concerns us here
are the parallels between Luke's story
and my reconstruction of the story of the sinful woman
from its many later textual manifestations.
Logioi, the elders brought in a woman
who had been accused of many sins
and standing her in the center.
They said to him, Teacher,
Moses commanded us in the law to stone such a woman.
So what do you say?
But they were saying this to test him.
Luke, one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him
and a woman who was a sinner in the city
on learning that he was reclining
in the house of the Pharisee.
The others at dinner
found the woman's erotic expression of contrition
to be offensive and faulted Jesus
for not recognizing what kind of woman she was.
She is a sinner.
Logioi, but Jesus stooped down
and was writing in the ground with his finger.
And as they continued interrogating him,
he straightened up and said to them,
whoever has not sinned,
let him lift a stone and throw it.
And he stooped down again and was writing in the ground
and no one dared to do it.
And they left one by one.
Jesus is writing with his finger in the dirt,
contrasts his view of Torah
to what one finds in Deuteronomy 9, 10, the LXX OG.
The Lord gave to me, Moses,
two stone tablets written by the finger of God
and in them had been written
all that the Lord had spoken to you.
Apparently, it was the Mosaic commandment in Deuteronomy 22, 21
that Jesus wrote in the dirt.
Luke, Jesus rebukes the Pharisees
and vindicates the woman in verses 40 to 46.
Therefore, I tell you, her sins, though many, are forgiven.
She thus loved much.
But one who is forgiven little loves little.
And he said to her, your sins are forgiven.
And those who were reclining with him
began to say among themselves,
who is this fellow who even forgives sins?
Logioi and Jesus straightened up and said to her,
woman, where are they?
No one is condemning you, are they?
She said, no one, Lord.
And Jesus said, I do not condemn you either.
Go.
It would appear that the story of Jesus
forgiving the sinful woman was known
not only to Papias, but also to Luke
who cleverly revised it.
In both Matthew and Luke, Jesus befriends
a chum of sinners, only if they first repent.
What about Mark?
If he knew the lost gospel,
did he simply snub this episode?
Or did he somehow transform it?
He transformed it into an affirmation of monogamy.
In the following columns,
note the impressive lexical and thematic parallels.
Logioi 5, 17 through 22.
Mark 10, 2 to 5.
The elders brought in a woman
who had been accused of many sins
and standing her in the center.
They said to him, teacher,
Moses commanded us in the law to stone such a woman.
So what do you say?
But they were saying this to test him.
This commandment appears in Deuteronomy 22, 21.
Pharisees came and asked him
if it was permitted for a man to divorce his wife
to test him.
And in response, he said to them,
what did Moses command you?
They said, Moses allowed him
to write a scroll of dissolution and to divorce.
This commandment appears in Dote 24, 1 to 4.
But Jesus stooped down
and was writing in the ground with his finger.
And as they continued to interrogate him,
he straightened up and said to them.
But Jesus said to them,
whoever has not sinned,
let him lift a stone and throw it.
And he stooped down again
and was writing in the ground
and no one dared to do it.
For your hard hearts,
he wrote you this commandment.
Note the following similarities.
In both stories, Jewish authorities,
elders or Pharisees test Jesus
about sexual matters.
In both, at the core of the dispute
is what Moses had commanded.
In both, the text to be interpreted
comes from Deuteronomy 22, 21 or 24, 1 to 4.
Both portray Jesus' opponents as sinners.
Confirmation of Mark's transformation
of our tell appears just a few verses later
where Jesus applauds an inquirer
for obeying the 10 commandments,
including the command to not commit adultery.
Mark's transformation thus removes his writing in dirt
and turns his refusal to stone the promiscuous woman
as required in Deuteronomy 22, 21
into prohibition of divorce
as permitted in Deuteronomy 24, 1 through 4.
Even though reverse priority
is the most important criterion
for inclusion in Logoi
according to Q plus papious hypotheses,
it is not the only one.
In the case of Jesus is forgiving the sinful woman,
all four apply.
Reverse priority
does a more primitive version
of the Logian appear in text
written later than its known sources?
Luke's priority to Matthew indicates
that he inherited the following Logian from elsewhere.
The son of man came eating and drinking
and you say,
look, a person who is a glutton and drunkard,
a chum of tax collectors and sinners.
What follows immediately in Luke is a meal
where Jesus demonstrates how greatly
a sinful and repentant woman loved him.
Evidence of tradition.
Does the Logian display evidence
that the evangelist inherited it
and did not simply create it?
Even earlier than Luke,
papious's exposition contained a tale about a woman
who had been accused before the Lord of many sins.
Congruence.
Is the Logian compatible
with Logia established by reverse priority?
Criterion A.
Jesus' forgiveness of the woman
illustrates his lax attitude to Mosaic law
throughout the lost gospel.
As in this declaration,
the law and the prophets were,
were in force until John.
From then on,
the kingdom of God is in force.
A kingdom that includes those
who do not obey all of the Mosaic commandments.
Or,
Logoi 711,
woe to you Pharisees,
for you tithe, mint, and dill, and cumin,
and give up justice and love.
But these one had to do
without giving up those.
Omission or transformation.
In later gospels,
can one explain why?
If a synoptic evangelist saw a Logian,
he avoided including it
or radically transformed it.
In the reception history of this story,
three aspects of it have proved to be problematic.
One, Jesus' refusal to observe
an explicit Mosaic command.
Two, his cryptic writing
with his finger in the dirt.
And three, the woman's failure to repent.
By omitting the story,
as is the case with Matthew,
or by transforming the story
into a story of a woman's contrition,
as is the case with Luke,
or by transforming it
into an affirmation of monogamy.
The synoptic evangelists
avoided all three problems.
One might diagram
these intertextual connections
as follows.
See the graph.
This example opens the door
to qualifying additional Logia
to the Logoi of Jesus
by identifying other instances
where Mark, though written first,
displays content
with secondary alterations.
In this case,
Papias and Luke,
though written later
than Mark and Matthew
are the most valuable witnesses
to this famous story.
But Q is an intensive care,
not only for Luke's
Matthew intolerance,
but also for Mark and deficiency anemia.
The discovery of a reversed priority
of Matthew and Luke to Mark,
meaning Matthew has older material
in it than Mark
and Luke has older material
in it than Mark,
strongly suggests
that the Mark and evangelist
knew the same lost gospel
that later informed Matthew and Luke.
This is the major contribution
of M2DH.
As we now shall see,
the number of parallels
is far greater
if one takes into account
Mark's extensive imitations
of classical Greek poetry,
especially the Homeric epics.
Treatment for Mark and deficiency anemia.
Injections of Homeric mimesis.
I have defended mimesis criticism
and Mark's imitations of the Iliad
and the Odyssey
in many publications,
most extensively in synopses
of epic tragedy
and the Gospels.
I obviously cannot do justice
to them in this documentary,
but I can cite examples to show
that when one recognizes
Mark's project
of creating a myth of origins
to compete with the Homeric imitations
in Virgil's Aeneid,
the evangelists' debts
to the lost gospel
come into clear focus.
One can find many more instances
in must the synoptics
remain a problem.
Two keys for unlocking
gospel intertextuality.
The two keys are
1. The recognition of Mark's
programmatic imitations
of the Homeric epics
and 2. The recognition
of Mark's redactions
of the logo eye of Jesus.
Without these two keys,
the synoptic will continue
to remain insoluble.
It is the faithful application
of these two treatments
that ultimately discharges Q
from intensive care
and permits a full recovery.
Jesus calls fishermen
to follow him.
Mark 1, 16 through 20.
Luke 9, 57 through 62
contains details
more primitive
than the parallel episode
in Matthew 8, 18 through 22.
An inconvenient fact
for advocates of
farer hypothesis
insofar as,
in this case at least,
Luke's version
must have derived
from elsewhere.
At first appearance,
it might appear that
Mark was oblivious
to Q's account,
but that is not the case.
Instead of conservatively
redacting the lost gospel,
to Mark and evangelists,
radically rewrote it
as an important aspect
of his memesis
of the Odyssey.
In this case,
the model or typos
was Athena's acquisition
of a ship
and a crew for Telemachus
after his rejection
by his neighbors in Ithaca.
Athena looking like Telemachus
went throughout the city,
approached every man,
told her story
and asked them to gather
a dusk by a swift ship.
Then from Noamon,
the illustrious son of Fronius,
she asked for a swift ship
and he gladly pledged it to her.
And to them,
spoke the sacred might
of Telemachus.
Come friends,
let's bring the supplies.
Having said this,
he led and they followed.
And then Telemachus
boarded the ship
and Athena led
and sat down at the stern.
The Mark and evangelists
cleverly rewrote
what he saw
in the lost gospel
in order to make
four fishermen
Jesus' first admirers
and to provide him a ship
for later adventures
on the Sea of Galilee.
Compare the following.
Logoi 3, 7 through 10.
Mark 1, 16 to 20.
Someone said to him,
I will follow you
wherever you go.
And Jesus said to him,
foxes have holes
and birds of the sky
have nests.
But the son of man
does not have anywhere.
He can lay his head.
As he passed along
the Sea of Galilee,
he saw Simon and Andrew,
the brother of Simon,
casting nets into the sea.
They were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them,
come after me
and I will make you fishermen
for people.
Immediately they left their nets
and followed him.
But another said to him,
and going on a bit further,
he saw Jacob,
the son of Zebedee
and his brother John.
They were in a boat
repairing the nets.
Master, permit me first
to go and bury my father.
But he said to him,
follow me and leave the dead
to bury their own dead.
Immediately he called them
and they left their father,
Zebedee, in the boat
with the hired men
and went off after him.
Mark apparently knew
this logion from Logoi,
which later informed
Matthew and Luke
because both later evangelists
redacted both stories.
They created mimetic doublets.
Look at my image
of Jesus calling fishermen.
A dominant feature of
must the synoptics
remain a problem.
Our diagrams such as this one,
which requires an explanation
when one first encounters them.
Numbers preceded by hash marks
identify the logion numbers
used in synopses of epic
tragedy and the gospels.
Jesus's acquisition
of followers appears
in both Matthew and Luke
and reverse priority
older material
points not to Luke's redaction
of Matthew
but to his debt
to the lost gospel.
I depict the retention
of the logion
with an arrow pointing down
to Matthew and Luke
in the bottom left.
Next, look at the top right.
It would appear that
the Homeric story of Athena
providing Telemachus
a crew and a ship
informed Mark's account
but so did Logoi.
Note the relevant arrows.
Mark's account thus
is a mimetic hybrid.
Note also
the arrow dropping down
to Matthew and Luke
in the bottom right corner.
Here
we find mimetic doublets.
That is
the Matthew and Luke
and authors
not only retained
the acquisition of disciples
from Logoi
but also the calling
of fishermen from Mark.
And this is why
such mimetic doublets
are important for solving
the synoptic problem.
Traditional reconstructions
of Q
insist
that Mark did not inherit
the story from it.
This then is a case
of Q's
mark and deficiency anemia
caused by insensitivity
to Mark's mimesis
of the Odyssey.
To my knowledge
no scholar
has argued for Mark's indebtedness
to the end of Odyssey 2
and Athena's acquisition
of a ship.
That is
advocates of both
two document hypothesis
and far hypothesis
lack the first key
to solving the synoptic problem.
They also lack the second
two document hypothesis
insists
that Mark was ignorant
not only of the Odyssey
but also of Q.
Far hypothesis
insists
that the Matthew-Luke
overlaps issue simply
from Luke's use of Matthew
and likely
have nothing to do with Mark.
Only Q plus
papious hypothesis
and Mark's Homeric mimesis
can account for these parallels
by applying both keys
Mark's mimesis of Homer
and his free redaction
of a lost gospel.
Syrophoenician woman
Mark 7
25
through 26.
My reconstruction
of the lost gospel
contains five verses
from Jesus's commissioning
of the 12
that do not appear in C.E.Q.
because Luke displays
no obvious vestige
of them.
Mark however
does.
Interpreters have not recognized
these parallels
for three reasons.
1. The Farah hypothesis
questions the existence of Q.
2. The two document hypothesis
omits them
because they appear
only in Matthew.
3. Both the Farah hypothesis
and two document hypothesis
fail to recognize
another Mark
and imitation of the Odyssey.
Odysseus' swine herd
Eumaeus
told his master
disguised as a beggar
that he was born on an island
called Syria
and that his nurse
came from Sidon
and was a Phoenician woman.
When he was still an infant
Phoenician traders
moored at the island
and one of them
seduced his nurse.
The lovers then stole
baby Eumaeus
together with goblets
from the master's table.
Artemis
the protector of children
killed with an arrow
the pirates through her body
overboard
and sold the baby
to kind-hearted laertes.
Odysseus speaks.
Eumaeus
surely you move the heart
in my breast
by telling each of these woes
that you have suffered
in your heart.
But surely Zeus
has given you good fortune
alongside the bad
for after having suffered much
you arrived at the home of a man
who is kind
who provides you food
and drinks solicitously
so that you live
a good life.
The hero thus
seeks to encourage Eumaeus.
Second best is good enough.
Here is Mark's tale
with highlighted parallels
to the commissioning
of the 12
in the lost gospel
as I have reconstructed it.
Jesus got up from there
and went into the region
of Tyre and Sidon
and when he entered a house
he did not want it
to become known
but he was unable to escape detection
but immediately
a woman heard about him.
Logoi 10
2 through 4
after summoning the 12
he gave them authority
over defiling spirits
and to heal diseases
and sent them
two by two
saying
do not go on the way
to the Gentiles
and do not enter a city
of the Samaritans.
Mark 7
25 B
26
her daughter
had a defiling spirit.
She came and fell at his feet
and the woman was Greek
Sarah Phoenician by birth
and she asked him to cast
the demon from her daughter
and he said to her
let the children
first be fed.
Logoi 10
5 through 6
A
do not give what is holy
to the dogs
and do not throw your pearls
before swine
go rather
to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.
Mark 7
27 B
for it is not good
to take the bread of children
and throw it to the dogs.
She responded
and said Lord
even the dogs
under the table
eat the children's scraps.
And he said to her
go the demon has departed
from your daughter
because of this comment
and after she left
for her house
she found the girl
thrown on a bed
and the demon gone.
The Mark and evangelist
not only depicted the woman
as a Gentile
but with some help
from Homer
a native resident
of ancient Phoenicia
born a Sarah Phoenician
and culturally Greek
furthermore
she was a single woman
no father appears
in the story
and her daughter
was demon possessed
one can scarcely
imagine a character
more alien
to the house of Israel
even Mark's
Jesus
viewed the daughter
as a Gentile dog
the woman's request
speaks
for the evangelist
the exclusion
of Gentiles
is deficient
in scope
and compassion
the mathian
evangelist
redacted Mark's story
but added
an unmistakable citation
of the lost gospel
he
Jesus replied
I was sent
exclusively
to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel
but she came
and worshiped him
saying
Lord
help me
check out the
Sarah Phoenician woman chart
because the
Luke and evangelist
omitted the story
of the Sarah Phoenician woman
this diagram
looks quite different
let's begin
in the upper right corner
it would appear
that Homer story
about Eumaeus
his Phoenician nurse
informed Mark's story
which also shares wording
with a passage in Matthew
about the 12
not evangelizing Gentiles
note the arrows
to Mark 7
and Matthew 10
on the left
back to Mark
note the arrow down
to Matthew 15
on the right
which symbolizes
Matthew's version
of Mark's story
but it also cites a sentence
from Logoi
as symbolized
by the long
diagonal arrow
this is why the chart is important
for the synoptic problem
no previous reconstruction
of the lost gospel
includes Jesus' instruction
to the 12
not to evangelize Gentiles
blessed is the one
who comes
Mark 11
1 through 14
in the following columns
your house
refers to the Jerusalem temple
Matthew 33
38 through 39
look
your house
has left a wilderness
for I tell you
you will not see me
from now
until you say
blessed is the one
who comes
in the name
of the Lord
Luke 1335
your house is forsaken
I tell you
you will not see me
until you say
blessed is the one
who comes in the name
of the Lord
Luke's version
is nearly identical
to Matthew's
except
that instead of
your house
is left a wilderness
suggesting knowledge
of the fall of the temple
one reads in Luke
merely that
your house
is forsaken
suggesting merely
the God no longer
will protect it
from harm
Luke's reversed priority
to Matthew
thus would be yet another
inconvenient fact
for far hypothesis
score one
for two document hypothesis
critical edition of Q
justifiably includes it
inconvenient for
two document hypothesis
however
is evidence
that Mark
incorporated the same
saying
into his account
of the triumphal
entry
which C.E.Q.
acknowledges
as a parallel
though not necessarily
lifted from Q
Mark's model
for Jesus's arrival
in Jerusalem
was Odysseus's
picaresque
entry
into the city
of the phyachians
compare the following
Odyssey 6
and 7
Odysseus
arrived on the island
of the phyachians
entirely bereft
Athena told
Nasika to ask her father
for mules
and a wagon
Nasika told her father
she needed the wagon
to do her wash
her father granted
Nasika the mules
she folded the clothes
and put them on the beautiful wagon
yoked the strong hoofed mules
and mounted herself
Nasika's mule cart
led the way
then came Odysseus
on foot
hidden among the slave women
Odysseus traveled
through the fields
Odysseus though a king
entered the city
wearing someone else's clothing
behind a mule wagon
carrying laundry
Nasika viewed Odysseus
as the will of the gods
Phyachians esteemed him
as a god
he entered the city
late in the day
Odysseus just stood there
gawking
and when he had gawked
at everything
among the marvels
was the Garden of Alsinus
with its fig trees
that bore even out
of season
fig after fig
Mark 11 1 to 14
Jesus arrived in Judea
without money
or a host
Jesus told two of his disciples
to find a cult
and bring it to him
the disciples told those
with the cult
the Lord has need of it
the owners allowed them to take
they brought the cult
to Jesus
and put their clothes over it
and he sat on it
some of those
escorting Jesus
into Jerusalem
walked ahead
and others
behind
some in the crowd
brought branches
cut from the fields
Jesus though the Son of God
entered the city humbly
riding on someone else's
beast of burden
with clothing for a saddle
the crowds shouted
blessed is the one
who comes in the name of the Lord
on entering the temple
late in the day
Jesus looked around
at everything
the next day
he cursed a fig tree
for bearing no fruit
even though
it was not the season for figs
while the parallels to Odysseus
and the Odyssey
are quite intriguing
what most concerns us here
is Mark's incorporation
of the saying
attributable to the Lost Gospel
on the basis of Luke's
inverted priority to Matthew
meaning Luke has older material
than Matthew
in addition to identical wording
in both cases
the saying is used
in the context of a criticism
of the Jerusalem Sanctuary
Logoi 721b
you will not see me
until the time comes
when you say
blessed is the one
who comes in the name
of the Lord
Mark 11 tonka 9
while those who preceded
and followed
were crying out
Hosanna
blessed is the one
who comes in the name
of the Lord
because the Matthew
and Luke and evangelist
reproduced Logoi's
beautitude
and Mark's account
of Jesus' entry
into Jerusalem
each created
a memetic doublet
look at the
blessed is the one
who comes
graph
all reconstructions of Q
include the acclamation
blessed is the one
who comes in the name
of the Lord
because it appears
with the identical wording
in both Matthew
and Luke
note the downward arrow
from Logoi
to Matthew 23
and Luke 13
the same sentence
already had appeared in Mark
in the acclamation
of the Jerusalem crowds
at Jesus' entry
which the evangelist
apparently modeled
after Odysseus' entry
in to the city
of the phyachians
here then
is another mark
in hybrid
caused by his dependence
on both Logoi
and Homer
note the relevant arrows
because Matthew and Luke
both redacted
Mark's story
and the acclamation
from Logoi
they independently
created memetic
doublets
note the arrow
on the right
parable of the wicked
vine dressers
Mark 12
1 through 12
Luke 20
9 through 19
unquestionably
is more primitive
than the parallel
in Matthew 21
33 through 46
an inconvenient fact
for far hypothesis
advocates
of two document hypothesis
thus were justified
in reconstructing
Q's parable
as follows
A certain man
prepared a large dinner
and invited many
and he sent his slave
at the time of the dinner
to say to the invited
come
for it is now ready
and all began
to make excuses
the first said to him
I bought a farm
and need to go to check on it
I beg you
let me be excused
and another said
I bought five yoke of oxen
and I'm going to try them out
I beg you
let me be excused
and another said
I married a wife
and therefore
I am not able to come
and the slave said
these things to his master
then the householder
enraged
said to his slave
go out on the roads
and whomever you find
invite
so that my house
may be filled
advocates of
to document
hypothesis
to DH
noting that
Mark has no obvious equivalent
to this parable
assumed that this evangelist
was ignorant of it
not so
the marketing evangelist
has nested it
in another imitation
of the Odyssey
as a youth
Odysseus had planted an orchard
with his father
laertes
and before going off
to fight in Troy
he had built his own house
he then put his slaves
in charge of his estate
his wife's suitors
and several unfaithful slaves
abused the family
and its slaves
and feasted on the produce
of the farm
they even plotted
to kill Odysseus's beloved son
away from the public eye
Antinous
let us hear
and now devise a miserable death
for him
for Telemachus
and may he not elude us
for I suppose
that as long as he is alive
these deeds
will not be accomplished
but come
before he assembles
the Achaeans
at the Agora
when they hear of our wicked deeds
they will not approve
let's do this
lest they do us harm
and expel us from our lands
and we go to the land of others
let us get the jump on him
by seizing him in the field
far from the city
or on the road
let us take possession
of his property
and his goods
divvying them up
fairly among us
fortunately for Telemachus
the suitors ultimately
rejected this plan
of course
when Odysseus finally returned
he killed the suitors
and treacherous slaves
and rewarded the faithful
compare the following
Odyssey
Odysseus built his house
put his slaves in charge
and went off
to fight in Troy
the suitors
abused the master's slaves
and ate from the estate
as though it were their own
Telemachus
the beloved son
sought to regain his authority
over the estate
Antinous
son of Eupithus
spoke among them
let us hear
and now
devise a miserable death for him
let us get the jump on him
by seizing him in the field
far from the city
or on the road
let us take possession
of his property
and his goods
Odysseus returned
destroyed the suitors
and rewarded his faithful slaves
and traveled from home
at the appropriate time
he sent a slave to the tenants
to receive from them
some of the vineyard
three
after seizing and beating him
they sent him away
empty-handed
five
he sent yet another slave
whom they killed
he had one more option
a beloved son
he sent him to them last of all saying
they will treat my son with respect
those tenant farmers said to each other
this is the air
come let us kill him
and the inheritance will be ours
they seized him
killed him
and threw him out of the vineyard
what will the master of the vineyard do?
he will come
destroy the farmers
and give the vineyard to others
Logoi 8
43-49
a certain man prepared a large dinner
and invited many
and he sent his slave
at the time of the dinner
to say to the invited
come
for it is now ready
and all began to make excuses
the first said to him
I bought a farm
and need to go check on it
I beg you
let me be excused
and another said
I bought five yoke of oxen
and I'm going to try them out
I beg you
let me be excused
and another said
I married a wife
and therefore I am not able to come
and the slave told these things to his master
then the householder
enraged
said to his slave
go out on the roads
and whomever you find
invite
so that my house may be filled
Mark 12-1
B-5
9
a man planted a vineyard
placed a hedge around it
dug a wine vat
built a tower
and hired it out to tenant farmers
and went on a journey
and at the appropriate time
he sent a slave to the tenants
to receive from them
some of the produce from the vineyard
and after seizing and beating him
they sent him away empty handed
and again he sent another slave to them
they struck that one in the head
and dishonored him
and he sent yet another slave
whom they killed
and many others
some of whom they beat
and some they killed
the vine-dressers kill the master's beloved son
so what will the master of the vineyard do?
he will come
destroy the farmers
and give the vineyard to others
look at the parable of the wicked vine-dresser's graph
because Luke's version of the parable of the great supper
obviously is older than Matthew's
it appears in all reconstructions of Q
note the downward arrow at the left of the diagram
no reconstruction however suggests
that the mark and evangelist knew the same parable
despite the obvious similarities in wording
the differences in mark
almost certainly issue
from the suggestion by one of Penelope's suitors
that they slay Telemachus
if so, here again
we have a mark and memetic hybrid
indicated by the arrows from Logoi
and the Odyssey to Mark
finally, Matthew and Luke retained both parables
the great supper from Logoi
and the wicked vine-dresser's from Mark
thereby creating memetic doublets
here again, recognition of Mark's Homeric imitation
permits the reader to detect the author's debt to Logoi
which is denied both by Q advocates and Q skeptics
one of the reasons the synoptic problem isn't solved
is the conundrum that Luke and Matthew
though they are later than Mark
contain materials that are older than Mark
and Luke has material older than Matthew
Dr. Dennis R. McDonald suggests
the Q plus papious hypotheses
solves these issues
Luke's older material to Matthew
is an inconvenient fact for far hypothesis
since the far hypothesis suggests
that Matthew just used Mark
yet Luke used Matthew and Mark
without an earlier gospel
but this mark and memetic hybrid
is also inconvenient fact
for the two document hypotheses
since Mark apparently knew this parable from Logoi
which later informed Matthew and Luke
because both later evangelists
redacted both stories
they created memetic doublets
to summarize to my knowledge
no scholar has argued
for Mark's indebtedness to the Odyssey
and the plot against Telemachus
that is advocates of both
two document hypotheses
and far hypothesis
lack the first key to solving the synoptic problem
they also lack the second
two document hypotheses
insist that Mark was ignorant
not only of the Odyssey
but also of the Logoi
far hypothesis insist
that the Matthew Luke overlaps
conceivably could issue
simply from Luke's use of Matthew
and have nothing to do with Mark
only the Q plus papious hypothesis
and Mark's Homeric memesis
can account for these parallels
by applying both keys
Mark's memesis of Homer
and ingenious redaction
of a lost gospel
Mark's apocalypse
Mark 13
1 through 37
Nowhere does the gospel of Mark
display more parallels
with traditional reconstructions of Q
than in chapter 13
because of this density
this so-called Marken apocalypse
has been a gold mine for advocates
of modified two document hypotheses
M2DH
who insists that this evangelist
must have known the lost gospel
that later informed Matthew and Luke
fans of far hypothesis
of course would dismiss any attempt
to attribute these sayings to Q
and most proponents
of two document hypotheses
remain skeptical
of any literary relationship
between Mark and Q
each of these solutions
to the synoptic problem
share this invidious element
blindness
to Mark's Homeric memesis
of Odyssey 19
the so-called nip-dra
or washing
because the book ends with Eurycleia's
famous recognition of Odysseus
while washing his feet
by curing this element
one can see more clearly
Mark's extensive revisions
of the lost gospel
note the following similarities
Odysseus and Jesus
both tried to keep their true identities
a secret
Telemachus was amazed
at the great light
that's shown on the walls of his house
Mark
one of Jesus's disciples
was amazed at the great buildings
in the Jerusalem temple
Odysseus went to Penelope
and sat
Mark
Jesus went to the Mount of Olives
and sat
Penelope in private
questioned her husband
in disguise
Mark
four of the disciples in private
asked him about
the destruction of the temple
Odysseus answered
and gave her signs
that he had seen her husband
and that he would soon return
Mark
Jesus answered
and gave the sign
when he would return
that very day
Odysseus was consulting
the oak sacred
to Zeus at Nidonna
Mark
the disciples should consult the fig tree
Odysseus predicts his own return
in the third person singular
he is near
Mark
Jesus predicts his own return
he is near
Odysseus
all these things
will come to place
Mark's Jesus
until all these things
take place
no one knew if
or when Odysseus would return
Mark's Jesus
it is like a man on a journey
keep watch
because you do not know
when the Lord of the house is coming
the suitors were prepared
to kill Telemachus
and Odysseus
Mark
the chief priests and scribes
were seeking some deceitful way
to arrest and kill him
the suitors feared harm
from the people of Ithaca
Mark
the Jewish authorities
feared a popular uprising
after giving his prophecies
to Penelope
Odysseus
disguised as a beggar
sat by himself
Mark
after giving these prophecies
to four disciples
Jesus sat at table
in the humble home of Aleppo
Odysseus' old nurse Eurycleia
entered with a bowl of water
and washed his feet
later
she anointed him
generously with oil
Mark
a woman entered
with an expensive stone jar of ointment
and poured the contents on Jesus' head
when Eurycleia recognized her master
she dropped his leg into the vessel
spilling the water
Mark
the woman who broke the jar
to release the oil
the wicked female slave
Melantho
had objected to Penelope's generosity
to a poor beggar
a monstrous act
Mark
people dining with Jesus
objected to the woman's extravagant anointing
the ointment could have been sold
and the money given to the poor
Jesus told them
she had done
a beautiful act
the name Eurycleia means
renowned far and wide
Mark
Jesus declares that what she has done
will be remembered
wherever the good news is preached
Odysseus and Eurycleia discussed
the disloyalty of some of the female slaves
Mark
then Judas Iscariot
one of the twelve
went to the chief priests
for the purpose of betraying him
these parallels should suffice
to show that in Mark 13-14
the evangelist was profoundly indebted
to Odyssey 19
but he also was indebted to sayings of Jesus
from a lost gospel
the Mark and Apocalypse
thus is a magnificent
memetic hybrid
and again
integrates Logia
from Logoi
into Memesis of Homer
here is a list of possible parallels
between the lost gospel
and Mark
Logoi 8
11-12
when they bring you
into the synagogues
do not be anxious
about how or what you are to say
for it will be given to you in that hour
what you are to say
Mark 13-9-10-11
watch out for yourselves
they will hand you over to councils
and you will be beaten in synagogues
and you will stand before governors and kings
because of me
as a testimony to them
and the good news must first be announced
to all the Gentiles
and when they arrest you and hand you over
do not be anxious beforehand
about what you are to speak
but speak whatever is given to you
in that hour
for it is not you
who speak
but the Holy Spirit
Logoi 8-26-27
I have come to divide
son against his father
and daughter against her mother
and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
and a person's enemies
are those at home
Mark 13-12
brother will deliver up brother to death
and a father his child
and children will rebel against parents
and have them put to death
Logoi 4-3-4
blessed are you when they hate and insult you
and say every kind of evil against you
because of the son of man
be glad and exult
for vast your reward in heaven
for this is how they treated the prophets
Mark 13-13
why who will be hated by everyone
because of my name
but the one who endures to the end
will be saved
Logoi 9-1
if they say to you
look there
do not go out
look here
do not believe it
Mark 13-21-23
if anyone then says to you
look here is the Messiah
or look there
do not believe it
Logoi 9-2
as the lightning streaks out from sunrise
and flashes as far as sunset
so will the son of man be on his day
Mark 13-24-25
in those days after the affliction
the sun will be darkened
the moon will not give its glow
the stars will fall from the sky
and the powers of the skies will be shaken
Logoi 7-21-B
you will not see me until the time comes
when you say blessed is the one who comes
in the name of the Lord
Mark 13-26
then they will see the son of man
coming on the clouds of heaven
with power and glory
compare Mark's version of this
in the next parallel
with this lie
told by Odysseus to Penelope
her husband
went to Dodona to hear the will of Zeus
from the divine oak tree with lofty foliage
how he might return to his beloved homeland
openly or secretly
after having been gone for so long
so he is safe
and will come
very soon
not for long will he be far from his loved ones
and homeland
nevertheless
I will give you my oath
at the departure of the light
Odysseus will come here
between the waning and waxing of the moon
Logoi 8-28-30
when evening has come
you say good weather
for the sky is flame red
and at dawn
today it's wintry
for the lowering sky is flame red
the face of the sky
you know how to interpret
but the time you are not able to
Mark 13-28-29
learn the parable from the fig tree
as soon as its branch becomes tender
and its sprouts leaves
you know that the summer is near
so also when you see these things taking place
you know that he is near
at the gates
Logoi 4-11
it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away
than for one iota
or one serif of the law to fall
Mark 13-31
heaven and earth will pass away
but my words will never pass away
Logoi 8-23
the master of that slave will come on a day
he does not expect
and at an hour he does not know
and will cut him to pieces
and give him an inheritance with the faithless
Mark 13-32-33
concerning that day or hour
no one knows
neither the angels in heaven
nor the sun
but only the father
watch out and stay awake
for you do not know when the time is
Logoi 9-11-12-A
a person on taking a trip
called his slaves and gave them his money
to one he gave five minas
to another two
and to another one
and he took a trip
Mark 13-34
it is like a person on a trip
who left his house and gave authority to his slaves
to each one his task
commanded his doorkeeper to watch
Logoi 8-15-A
blessed are those slaves
whose master on arriving finds watching
Mark 13-35-37
keep watch
for you do not know
when the master of the house is coming
in the evening
or at midnight
or a cockroach
or in the morning
lest he come suddenly
and find you sleeping
and what I say to you
I say to all
watch
Mark 13 thus is a magnificent memetic hybrid
that embeds over 20 verses
from the lost gospel
within his extensive imitation of Odyssey 19
the author of Logoi
located all these Logia in Galilee
whereas Mark relocated all of them
in the shadow of the Jerusalem sanctuary
we now shall see why he did so
Jesus threat
to destroy the Jerusalem temple
Mark 13-2
16 verses in Mark 13
from the lost gospel
predict the return of Jesus
as the Son of Man
but the five that come before verse 24
pertain instead to events before
and during the coming Jewish war
this first half of the chapter thus
offers an answer to a question
from the four disciples
tell us
when will these things happen
and what will be the sign
that these things are about to be fulfilled
the reader earlier
had been told what the disciples meant by
these things
as he was leaving the temple
one of his disciples said to him
teacher
look what kind of stones
and how great the buildings
and Jesus said to him
do you see these large buildings
one stone here will not be left
upon a stone
that will not be destroyed
these verses too
have parallels
in Odyssey 19
when Odysseus and Telemachus
enter their home
it radiates a mysterious glow
then at once
Telemachus spoke to his father
Oh Father
what a great marvel
that I see with my eyes
the walls of the hall
the beautiful panels
the pine beams
and the pillars that loom above
they appear to my eyes
as though burning with fire
surely some God is within
one of those who hold spacious heaven
shrewd Odysseus answered him
and said be quiet
get a grip on your mind
and stop your questioning
this is the way of the gods
who hold Olympus
in Mark 13 2
Jesus takes no responsibility
for the destruction of the temple
but the Mark and evangelist
clearly was aware of a threat
that he himself would destroy it
when he returned victorious
as the son of man
here is the relevant passage
from Jesus's trial
before the Sanhedrin
some false witnesses
against him rose up and said
we heard him say
I will destroy this sanctuary
that is made with hands
and after three days
I will build another
that is not made with hands
and again
their testimony was not consistent
and the chief priest
arose in the middle
interrogated Jesus and said
have you nothing to answer
these people
who are witnessing against you
he was silent
and made no response
this false charge against Jesus
for having threatened to destroy the temple
reappears later
at his crucifixion
those who passed by derided him
shook their heads and said
aha
destroyer of the sanctuary
and builder of it in three days
rescue yourself
by coming down from the cross
furthermore
the comment immediately following Jesus's death
suggests that by killing Jesus
his foes had sparked the destruction of the temple
Jesus gave a loud cry and expired
and the veil of the sanctuary
was ripped in two
from top to bottom
the rending of the temple veil
symbolized God's abandonment of it
and refusal to protect it any longer
Matthew's version of Mark 13 1-2
strongly suggests
that he saw Jesus's threat
to destroy the temple
at the end of the following passage
which as we have seen
came from the lost gospel
because of Luke's reverse priority to it
Matthew 23 37-39
and Luke 13 34-35
the following reconstruction is identical to that
in CEQ
O Jerusalem
Jerusalem
who kills the prophets and stones
those sent to her
how often I wanted to gather your children together
as a hen
gathers her nestlings under her wings
and you were not willing
look
your house is forsaken
I tell you
you will not see me until the time
blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord
I located my hypothetical reconstruction
of the temple threat and logoi
immediately after this prophecy
because this is precisely
where the mathian evangelist
locates his redaction
of Mark 13 1-2
compare the following
logoi 7 22
mat 24 1-2
and as he was leaving the temple
one of his disciples said to him
teacher look what kind of stones
and how great the buildings
I will destroy this sanctuary
that is made with hands
and build another
that is not made with hands
and Jesus said to him
do you see these large buildings
one stone here
will not be left upon a stone
that will not be destroyed
what follows
is Matthew's redaction
of Mark's apocalypse
which is loaded
with the logia from logoi
the mathian author
apparently saw in logoi
immediately following
Jesus's judgment on Jerusalem
his threat to destroy the temple
he also would have seen
at the beginning of Mark 13
Jesus's prediction
that it would be destroyed by war
but not by him
to harmonize his sources
and to exculpate Jesus
for the failed prophecy
Matthew replaced logoi's threat
with Mark's prediction
and replanted logoi's judgment
on Jerusalem
just outside the temple
he thus replaced
logoi's threat
against the temple
with Mark's
less scandalous alternative
someone else will destroy
the buildings of the temple
not he
although these parallels
and their analyses
are complex
they magnificently satisfy
all three of the criteria
for filling in the reconstruction
of the lost gospel
when there is no evidence
of reversed priority
criterion A
evidence of tradition
does the Lodian display
evidence that the evangelist
inherited it
and did not simply create it
surely the Markan evangelist
did not create this threat
against the temple
which he then had
to discredit
congruence
is the Lodian compatible
with Lodia
established by reverse priority
criterion A
in logoi
Jesus speaks
in the first person
and declares that
God has abandoned it
house
the temple
if the temple threat came next
it would extend
the first person voice
and suggest that now
that God will no longer
protect his house
Jesus can replace it
with another
not made with hands
omission
or transformation
in later gospels
can one explain why
if a synoptic evangelist
saw a Lodian
he avoided including it
or radically transformed it
all three synoptic evangelists
wrote after the destruction
of the Jerusalem temple
which disproved prediction
of in the logoi
that Jesus
at his victorious return
would do that job himself
and build another
not made with hands
the Markan author
transformed this prediction
at the beginning of his
apocalypse discourse
into one stone here
will not be left
upon a stone
that will not be destroyed
and then
has Jesus predict
vatacinium
exeventu
the coming war
those who
like the author of logoi
would say otherwise
resemble the false
witnesses at Jesus
Sanhedrin trial
and the hecklers
at the cross
the chief priests
and the entire Sanhedrin
was seeking testimony
against Jesus
in order to kill him
but they found none
for many witnessed
falsely against him
but their testimonies
were not consistent
and some false
witnesses against him
rose up and said
we heard him say
logoi 7 22
I will destroy this sanctuary
that is made with hands
and build another
that is not made
with hands
Mark 14 58B
I will destroy this sanctuary
that is made with hands
and after three days
I will build another
that is not
made with hands
and again
their testimony
was not consistent
and the chief priest
arose in the middle
interrogated Jesus
and said
have you nothing to answer
these people
who are witnessing
against you
he was silent
and made no response
see the graph
about the threat
against the temple
this diagram
differs from the previous
four
because Matthew and Luke
offer no independent
attestation
to Jesus' threat
against the Jerusalem temple
all we have to go on
are two passages in Mark
both of which
are agonistic
or hostile
to what they likely
saw in logoi
the context of the first
appears within a long
imitation of odysseus
predictions
of his return
to Penelope
at the beginning of which
Jesus predicts
that an imminent war
the temple
will be reduced
to rubble
Matthew and Luke
say so too
note the arrow
at the left
but at Jesus' trial
false witnesses
claim that Jesus
said that he himself
would destroy it
and build another
Matthew
but not Luke
said the same
note the arrow
on the right
all Q advocates
and Q skeptics
alike
understandably
have denied
any connection
between this saying
and a lost gospel
but it satisfies
the criteria
for inclusion
according to the
Q plus
papias
hypotheses
if I am right
about this reconstruction
of the synoptic tradition
Dr. McDonald says
it establishes
the existence
of a lost gospel
an inconvenient fact
for far hypothesis
and other Q skeptics
more significantly
in my view
it reveals the two
natal pathologies
of two
documentary hypothesis
one
the insistence
on recovering the lost gospel
by focusing on
Matthew
Luke
overlaps
against Mark
and
two
the insistence
that Mark was ignorant
of the lost gospel
in this case
the most important
witness
to a saying in
Logoi
is Mark
stated otherwise
this assessment
is a treatment
for two documentary
hypothesis
Mark and deficiency
anemia
Mark not only
knew the lost gospel
he is our earliest
witness to it
and as such
his gospel
must be taken
seriously
and any
textual reconstruction
of it
what would
a healthy Q
look like
the Logoi
of Jesus
the
Logoi
of Jesus
thus far
in this presentation
I have largely
ignored
considerations
of the original
literary
sequence
of
Logia
attributable
to the lost gospel
this presentation
is not the
right venue
for exploring
the matter
exhaustively
but detailed
treatments
are available
in previous
publications
including
synopses
of epic
tragedy
and the
gospels
the following
list of criteria
will have
to suffice
criteria
for establishing
Logoi's
original
sequence
a
frequently
all three
synoptics
present
Logia
attributable
to the lost gospel
in the same
sequence
which
should be
honored
be
Logia
that appear
in only
one
gospel
should be
located
near
content
in that
gospel
C
for
Lucan
Logia
without parallels
in mark
and that
display
reverse
priority
to
Matthew
but agree
with its
sequence
the shared
order
likely
derives
from the
lost
gospel
D
occasionally
two or more
Logia
attributable
to the
lost
gospel
evoke
a biblical
antecedent
that may
suggest
in which
order
they
originally
appear
E
when
Logia
appear
in a different
order
one
should
prefer the
one
that
displays
the least
literary
dislocation
one
should
prefer
the sequence
most
internally
meaningful
with other
content
one
can
confidently
attribute
to the
lost
gospel
Logoi's
social
identity
construction
and the
historical
Jesus
Q
as reconstructed
by
CEQ
is a
fragmentary
collection of
sayings
sprinkled
by the
occasional
narrative
this is not
the case
with my
reconstruction
that is
Dr.
Dennis
R.
McDonald's
reconstruction
of the
Logoi
of Jesus
which is
a coherent
rewriting
of the
book of
Deuteronomy
to portray
Jesus
as the
promised
prophet
like
Moses
more significantly
Logoi
creates a picture
of the
early
Jesus
movement
with distinctive
social
identity markers
a detailed
discussion
of my application
of social identity
theory
to
Logoi
appears
in
must the
synoptics
remain
a problem
the
basic principles
of social
identity
theory
are
intuitive
and straightforward
but their
implications
for mapping
social behavior
is spectacular
the three
formative
observations
of social
groups
are
one
the positive
auto-stereotyping
of the
in-group
two
the negative
heterostereotyping
of out-groups
and three
the idealization
of the in-groups
prototypical
leader
for the author of the
Logoi
Jesus
obviously is the
author's
idealized
leader
and is even called
Son of God
Son of Man
and Lord
he also is
Logoi's
soul
spokesperson
for the values
of the
stereotyped
in-group
especially
his 12
disciples
he identifies
members
of this
Jewish sect
as advocates
for
the Kingdom of God
the stereotyped
and vilified
out-groups
include
the rich
the managers
of the Jerusalem
Temple
but especially
Pharisees
and other
obdurant
Galilean
Torah
enforcers
social
in-groups
often define
their values
and behaviors
by distinguishing them
from those
of inimical
out-groups
and that
certainly
is the case
for the
author of the
Lost Gospel
nearly at the beginning
of Jesus
as inaugural discourse
one reads
the law
and the profits
were in force
until
John
from then on
the Kingdom of God
is in force
but it is easier
for heaven and earth
to pass away
than for one
iota
or one
serif
of the law
to fall
so whoever
does not
do one of
the least
of these commandments
will be called
least
in the Kingdom of God
and whoever
does them
this one
will be called
great
in the Kingdom of God
in other words
although
mosaic law
will remain
eternal
not
everyone
in the Kingdom of God
will keep
the least
of these commandments
Jesus
is radical
relaxing
of Torah
compliance
is consistent
with his
forgiveness
of an
unrepentant
woman
in direct
violation
of a mosaic
commandment
later
he tells
a certain
exegete
of the law
that the
only law
necessary
to keep
is this
you will love
the Lord
your God
with all your heart
and with
all your soul
and with
all your mind
and your neighbor
as yourself
Logoise
Jesus
thus establishes
the following
hierarchy
Jesus
the Son of God
and proclamer
of the Kingdom
of God
those
who observe
every commandment
those who do
not observe
every commandment
John the Baptist
the last
prophet
before
the Kingdom
of God
finally
those
born
of women
before
John
the Baptist
Moses
and the
biblical profits
of course
fall
into
the last category
the author's
mimesis
of Deuteronomy
was a brilliant
vehicle
for making
Jesus
the
prototypical
leader
of a
stereotype
in group
that defined
itself
as proclamers
of the Kingdom
of God
that included
Jews
who had been
marginalized
by harsh
Torah enforcers
the most
vilified
outgroup
even though
Logoise
is not a
history record
of Jesus
as sayings
its social identity
markers
place it
closer
than any
of the canonical
gospels
to the social world
of the historical
Jesus
for this reason
it is a vitally
important witness
to him
and his social
environment
according to
the lost gospel
he was not
a Christian
but a Jewish populist
and radical
reformer
whom the
Roman authorities
crucified
apparently
for whipping up
Jewish
confrontations
with their leaders
summary
and
conclusion
this
presentation
has argued
that
Q
likely will remain
in intensive care
unless it is treated
for two
serious
maladies
Luke's
Matthew intolerance
and Q's
mark
and deficiency
anemia
the treatment
for the first
is to recognize
Luke's
extensive
literary
debt to
Matthew
and
to transplant
its intolerance
of
Matthew
with its
reverse
priority
to it
this treatment
results
in an appreciation
of
Luke's reliance
on at least
three sources
a lost gospel
mark
and
Matthew
these three
thus
are among
the many
narratives
about Jesus
that the
Luke and
evangelist
told
theophilus
he had
followed
thoroughly
curing
the second
melody
requires
a separate
treatment
altogether
the remedy
for Q's
mark
and deficiency
anemia
requires
repeated injections
of
Mark's
Homeric
Mimesis
discovering
the extent
of parallels
between the
gospel
of Mark
and the
lost gospel
requires
serious attention
to Mark's
Mimesis
of the
Iliad
and especially
the
Odyssey
Mark's
memetic
hybridity
of
Logoi
and Homer
one
final observation
the reconstruction
of the lost gospel
was both
a science
and an art
in my view
that is
Dr.
Dennis R.
McDonald's view
traditional
reconstruction
of Q
such as
that in
CEQ
are longer
on the former
and weaker
on the latter
indeed
traditional
gospel
scholarship
in general
has been
prone to view
the evangelists
merely
as scribes
who
faithfully
redacted
sources
and
recorded
traditions
Mimesis
criticism
on the other hand
appreciates them
as the
literary
artists
that
they were
artists
who ventured
to rival
the most
venerated
poet
of
Greek
antiquity
as our
journey
through the
shadows of
history
and the
labyrinth
of ancient
texts
comes to a close
we find ourselves
more intrigued
than ever
the lost gospel
of Q
or
the
Logoi
of Jesus
as meticulously
uncovered
by Dr.
Dennis
R.
McDonald's
has opened

But remember
this is
not the
end
it's
merely
a new
beginning
the path
to unraveling
the enigma
of Q
is long
