Ladies and gentlemen, Derek Lambert, MythVision Podcast.
I want to say thank you, thus far.
2021 hasn't been an easy year for all of us.
We've all been struggling, and I'm glad we made it.
This online dealing with mythologies
and the studies of ancient religions,
Christianity, Judaism, and we're gonna be delving into more.
I want to say thank you for the GoFundMe,
people who helped complete the one for Dr. Bart Ehrman.
He will be appearing on MythVision Podcast
on May the 5th of 2021.
That's coming up soon.
I'll be looking forward to that.
All because you guys made that possible.
I have two GoFundMe's that I have made.
One is so that I could fly out to Dr. Richard Carrier
and meet him in person for two days in a row
and harass him like I do Dr. Robert McNair Price.
MythVision Podcast has truly gone down in history,
doing something unique that other podcasts
and YouTube channels haven't done.
And I've interviewed so much content
and continue to do so with Dr. Robert McNair Price.
We have never seen anything like that
on the internet with Dr. Richard Carrier.
I wanna go fly in person,
harass Dr. Carrier for two days in a row
asking your questions.
Help make that GoFundMe possible.
That's gonna cost around $2,000.
If you guys can go down in the description
and join and help, that's awesome.
If you can't, I appreciate everyone
who likes, comments, shares this content
just to grow the channel and to keep us going.
You're all a part of this.
But if you guys wanna participate,
I'll put your names down in the description.
I'll mention your name if you wanna be mentioned.
When I ask the scholar your question, you'll make history.
Also, Dr. Don J. Collins, John J. Collins
that I recently interviewed
and I've done a couple of interviews with him here.
I wanna fly up to Connecticut,
interview him for a couple of days in person.
If you guys wanna make history
with Professor John J. Collins
and help MythVision podcast do that,
you guys can help out with that GoFundMe.
Both of the GoFundMe's are down in the description.
Your names can be mentioned or remain anonymous.
It doesn't matter.
If you're able to do so and you wanna make history
and you wanna be part of it, please consider going down
in the description and making that happen.
Those are the two goals for 2021 that I really have
in terms of flying and interviewing in person
is Dr. Richard Carrier and John J. Collins.
I have more hopes for more scholars
in the future and making that happen
will be all up to you guys.
And of course, the development and growth
of MythVision podcast.
Once again, thank you.
Every single person who has participated
and making this channel grow, I so, so thank you.
And all the Patreon members who've joined
and helped us in that manner
and the hundreds of videos that I did for Dr. Price,
those questions are your questions.
I thank you so much.
I really do.
Never forget, wee.
Ah, MythVision.
