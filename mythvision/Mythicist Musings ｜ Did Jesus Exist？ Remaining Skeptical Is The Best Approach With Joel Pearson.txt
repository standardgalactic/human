we are myth vision welcome back ladies and gentlemen Derek Lambert here your
host dr. Luther please come back my friend we need to resurrect him from the
dead all of you seances and incantation people warlocks and witches please try to
resurrect him and if you can't we'll call upon Joseph the dreamer to possibly
come and interpret this dream we can get Luther to resurrect from the dead
somehow maybe three days and three nights earlier or later so let's see what
happens with that we have Joel Pearson with us what's going on Joel all right
I'll be protected by the angels at the moment I see that I was thinking that that
could be a crack on your screen but then then I'm becoming too much of a
naturalist and we're not giving credit to God so I need to pause back up for a
second and say you know what that does look like a flaming sword poking out at
the corner of your screen and I feel like the angels are going to be with the
message that you're going to present today am I wrong or yeah man either
that or it's an angel of light which they warned us to stay away from we'll
figure that out as your message comes out today we'll see where you land man you
might be on the bad guys team I don't know see the photographs from the omen
where you've got that line on the photograph showing what was going to
happen to them that's right I don't know too many interpretations there's too
many options you know it sounds like Christianity you know what I mean it's
like we could never figure it out I'm glad you joined me today brother we I
figure we'd have a I guess you say amusing today we'll just have a
interesting dialogue pertaining to historicity mythicism and shoot it
from the hip what do you say to that yeah it sounds like fun we can do some
just broad-scale stuff that people might not necessarily be aware of and we
could pick on individual points that sound interesting well let me ask you a
basic one since I guess a lot of people who look at this they're probably like
come on man we always hear this argument an argument from the majority
anyone who's to be taken seriously all these serious scholars seriously if you're
going to even think Jesus didn't exist possibly as an actual historical person
you're not to be taken serious it's like get out of my face don't even consider it
and therefore really make you feel well if I even take the stance from the get-go
I'm already I've already lost because you look like you're you're really just
purposely choosing a French side and all these serious scholars don't so what do
you say to that the majority argument and I know that that would be a logical
fallacy to try and push that on people but maybe delve into that a little if you
don't mind well in the most cases it does make sense to side with the
consensus and for example scientific consensus tend to be pretty solid
nowadays although that's the question is well what is this consensus based on
so if you doubt a consensus you want to go to the evidence find out how how much the
evidence backs the consensus but in cases where there's a lot of bias you want to
watch out for consensus so especially in anything involving faith then you have
to watch out what for what methodology they're using so we can we can look
into methodology and look at the evidence so like you know the idea of
there being a consensus of a flat earth because it looked flat and that's the
kind of thing where you say well yeah there was a time when everyone believes
the other's flat and that consensus was wrong so in the case of mysticism you
could say people who don't really understand the question and just want
to defer to the experts would say okay in that case users probably existed
because that's what most experts believe but then you have the major bias where
the funding is christian the scholars are christian in most cases
and we even have examples of people who have lost their jobs or been bullied in
some way for going against the christian position even on things where the
evidence is pretty solid against it so yeah it's one of the ones where you
shouldn't just go okay there are bias scholars here therefore the opposite is
true but you should at least question why this consensus exists
that's a good point and i agree i think i see that often in the arguments that
what we deal with i mean it makes you kind of honestly uh it's a very pressing
matter to me because that's the argument i hear from people who don't even know
the argument they don't know uh and i'm not meaning this in any way derogatory
that the the emotion i'm portraying here is not at all like oh they're stupid or
they don't know but they like legitimately have never actually delved into the
matters that we're talking about considered what's being presented and
saying now some people may have and still side on historicity don't get me
wrong i'm not denying that i'm just saying most people have not actually dealt
with the arguments considered what we're talking about here and saying
i actually understand why you think that way
even though i disagree that would be a fair position to take
instead it's uh are you ridiculous barred airman doesn't believe what you're
saying he's he admittedly says you're crap pots
you're french don't consider it at all i wouldn't even take you serious no
historical or no historian who's you know
serious would ever consider such an idea and that shuts off the door to inquiry
in my opinion um so we're trying to break down that that wall
bring this stuff out to the to the public and let them consider the evidence
at least bring the arguments ourselves and so that delves into another
question i want to ask you because you've been around for a while uh i mean a
good bit but longer than i have into the mythicist uh i would say to the
educated mythicist position um in terms of actual scholarship
that has taken the mythicism you know seriously what made you go from
historicism to mythicism or i know it's probably not one thing
because it's multiple layers that really convince us to start shifting gears
but can you recall like a aha moment is there any time that you can remember
so i mean i can move from historicism to agnosticism on the position
which was uh reading i think it was Richard Dawkins at the time when he was
saying these are the things where christians are
taught but this is what historians say so you're already moving away from a
faith-based position onto a historical position and saying
okay this is the actual quality of the evidence
you've got Ehrman's position where just the amount of corruption that there is
in the text and saying well we just we can't really say for sure we can
guess which pieces are and aren't reliable but then i compared Ehrman's
methods to Richard Carrier's and Carrier's methods in
uh what was the name of the book uh was it Proving History wasn't it
Proving History was the original one yeah yeah well he went through the
methodology used in jesus studies and why is this methodology only used on
jesus and nowhere else it's because it doesn't work it's unreliable
and every study used on these methods have shown that they're
some of them are literally logical fallacies and other ones just don't
work um so yeah it was i would say it was gradually
working through these systematically different books
and then moving further and further towards the methods this position it
wasn't until i read Carrier that i actually decided
jesus probably didn't exist um and that's one where you know there's so much
evidence laid out then it's so systematic that i haven't really seen a
good defense against it i haven't seen a good argument in the other direction
at the best i've seen is Ehrman's work uh did jesus exist
but obviously um the quality of that work isn't as high
i have to agree with you um from what i've seen so far
it it makes me wonder have they really considered what is being said
you know on Carrier's side it kind of made me wonder
um and didn't read um Carrier's book so you have to consider his position is not
fully up to date i don't know if he's read it since
but i haven't seen any sign that he has yeah i'd love to see him actually come
out with a if there is a jesus i would love i would
want to see him come out with a shotgun boom we're gonna
look here it is okay here it is but um i haven't heard that i haven't got the
aha moment i have become more skeptical
over time and i'm still torn between the two joe i must admit
um it's my opinion at this moment if there was a guy
the story is not really that guy they made this guy something he's not i know
Ehrman works with the Ehrman works with the model the
gospels give i think the model that the gospels give
are actually not uh proper accurate elements for who that guy was
there may be elements being brought in from a variety of different sources
which is why this frankenstein or you can call him the potato head
uh because he's got different pieces being put on him
trying to find out who he is at the core is going to be tough and so i kind of
wonder if at at the bottom of things when you look at stories like the book of
ax the fictional writings of ax yes i said it i'm just
going to go ahead and call it what it is fictional history all right i'll say
fictional history to be fair they talk about these rebels and they
compare jesus this movement of christianity to these rebels the egyptian
and they talk about judas the galilean they talk about
and they kind of equate and they say how these movements didn't succeed
yet the jesus one that they're trying to represent here
is still going well why why parallel christianity to this other these other
movements unless it's possible they're equating it to
this movement of jesus here now you don't necessarily have to have
the guy jesus christ in order for a movement to be going
we've seen that in arguments already made by carrier and them
this could be an angelic figure like we've been talking about but the movement
themselves is really trying to come against uh
rome and that kind of angle a bit stronger to me
than saying oh here's the guy here's the guy who says turning of the cheek
here's the guy who's you know rendered a Caesar
praising roman centurions you know doing some really odd ball stuff
it just uh it's hard to pin the tail on the donkey
and it's also interesting that the way they said um this movement's still going
if the movement if they were writing at the time of the movement and if this
was a witness to the movement in the early days then it wouldn't be much of
a boast to say well the movement's still going because well the guys who
started the movement are still doing it but if of course if axe is written
lifetimes later as it seems to be then it makes a perfect sense in the context
to say look this movement's still going even though the original founders have
died now i agree i think the way that um the way
that ermine uses the gospel timelines for jesus is by taking the gospels and
moving them back before paul that seems to be how he does this
hmm wouldn't that go against everything that he's teaching though about paul
being the earliest yeah exactly so so the way he
does this is he takes oral tradition and says the gospels represent oral
tradition and paul uh represents after the
oral tradition so he just takes the sources we've got
puts different dates on them and says well those are the original dates
so his sequence um in how jesus became god seems to be
the synoptics first and then paul and then john i think in order to fit them
together into the sequence that he wants to build for jesus becoming god
but if you go with the real dates then of course jesus starts out
as paul's jesus not as the gospel do you see that's what that's what gets me i
mean i don't know enough to see here and say definitively but it would be my
opinion that the gospels being i i suspect he takes that
stance because the where they place the gospels in chronology
and he probably looks at sources like tacitus and tries to use this as an
extra source to prove under Pontius Pilate you know this crustus so
let's go back to crustus under Pontius Pilate therefore the chronology of the
gospels orally would be from back there it to me and i mentioned this before
wouldn't it be just as plausible to suspect some historian who understood
per century history could create a or concoct a story
surrounding these contemporaries from the 30s 20s
you know ad it wouldn't be just as easy to say that they could concoct a story
using those characters rather than really saying oh this is really based off
what was really going on then i suspect someone like josephus as an example
not saying him alone but just someone like him probably
had the knowledge of what was going on during that time and could
elaborate a story uh that would place it back then
wouldn't you wouldn't you agree and using Pauline ideas
well you could of course concoct the story that way
um i don't think that christianity was big enough to warrant mention
at the time um the way it grew seems to be quite gradual
it seems to be quite an insular secretive cult um so yeah you'd have to write
considerably right later in order to invent a decent beginning for it in
that way so i think that the original writings of christianity
we've got that aren't considered forgeries are pretty much genuine
original writings of christianity um obviously the gospels being anonymous
later fictions um you can you can see them up a fiction all over them
in the way that they draw in other sources but i think paul's letters
probably genuine um you know the six or seven ones that most
golds agree on so to me that's representative of a very
small cult that did manage to grow systematically
through a lot of effort um and just because in the empire that's
a turmoil allowed them to do so and they were able to grow outside of judia
thanks to uh thanks to paul's efforts but um yeah it seems too small to me
and i don't think that it was invented by rome i think it was later used by rome
and it was later picked up by constantine for for good reason to be able to plunder
the pagan temples and be able to unify the empire um just at the right time
with just the right saturation of population um but yeah i don't think
that it was something that was wholesale invented i think they genuinely were
some jews in the first century who were working on this the real question is
was one of them jesus or was he just a figurehead
it's a good question and the more i delve into it the more i don't know
honestly but at least i'm fairly saying i don't know um
because i could easily and this is another thing people want people think uh
i think that there's a a large sum of mythosus out there
that with certainty believe he did not exist just like
there are a lot of historicists with certainty excuse me with certainty
to say he did exist i think it's fair to say i don't know
and i say some days i'm torn to saying he did
um probably did uh and and there's some days i'm torn between saying
and i need more evidence i just i just i don't see the guy the guy
that we're looking for um and and that's that's a fair
i think that's a fair position to have and i think the the more time we delve
into this question unless new evidence arises
i think more people will start to see what we're saying and say okay
i get why it's probability at this point and and the probability isn't so
absolute that he did exist we need to step back and say
all right let's look at the meat really what did he do really
who was this guy you know and so was he a pacifist no uh okay then what was he
you know was he a rebel leader like brandon would say
consider that let's look into it but um
i'm about to interview mike lorenz on my channel
i've been reading his book contra ermin i'm 56 through i give an exact number
because you know how uh it tells you on ebook exactly how far you are per page
percentage wise uh i had to set it down for five days had
family matters to take care of and uh he brings up some interesting points
um i i definitely want to go over those points with him in his book
on the show have you read his book i haven't read that one yet no
yeah check it out it's it's an interesting one uh it comes
you know comes straight for the heart of ermin
what ermin is espousing at its heart is practically that they wouldn't
invent like this is from what mike was saying
ermin's argument is christians or jews would never invent a suffering messiah
they would never have come up with this idea to say
hey our messiah is gonna die and on the cross you know or be crucified or be
killed our messiah and they say our messiah is going to be
successful he's going to win he's going to be a battle warrior who's going to be
victorious so he says this was a failed
mission uh they they put the title on this guy
who was supposed to be the messiah he goes and he fails
at doing what he was supposed to do as messiah they can't let go
you know cognitive dissonance so they have to concoct a way to have him come
back somehow and in my opinion already i have
so many red flags in that idea that you are now tearing down
the narrative the the fictional narrative in which
all of this is is is where we're basing our evidence
that narrative seems mythological and necessary as part of the whole myth so
how can you use that narrative to try and say oh well this was real stuff
but they mythologized the real stuff and really it became a hocus pocus he's
supposed to come again at the end of the first century which ends up
happening at the war very interesting idea of a 40-year
distance or as my uh mike mentions a 70 years
from zero or you know 180 up to 70 80 there's an interesting
mythological numerological significance to this story and when it was
placed in history all all of that is part of the
myth and so it was a very interesting thing to read you might want to check
out that book but i don't know if you've heard anything like that or not
um i've read some of mike lorenz's comments and
did he do any videos i think i might have seen some of his earlier stuff
i think he did um he's got some on youtube i've been reading the book though i
haven't really gotten the time to sit down and listen to a lot of his videos
yeah so um obviously the the 180 to 70 80 didn't exist at the time of all this
being done so but contextually they still have you know the maths they
still were trying to work out from daniel what years
things were supposed to happen i don't think you necessarily need to have
an individual person killed who was leaving the cult and then
replaced because you've got the context of it happening all the time
like you know israel had these failed revolts over time
for so long by that point they had this cycle of dying messiahs already
so you didn't have to have one specific one be picked you just have the general
trend of roam stamping on them every time they try and rise up
and that's good enough already for that myth to arise you don't need to have
a specific jesus killed you just have that theme
just in the consciousness and it's even more likely when it's
more than one happening in a sequence because then you get the sort of
um the sense that you'll never be able to defeat roam
through physical means that takes you down the spiritual road and saying okay
well we can't be them that way but god can't be wrong therefore
the only option left is that this is a spiritual victory not a physical
victory and for a moment to say that no
Jew would do that is obviously a ridiculous claim because you can't
possibly know what every single one of them was thinking
saying the majority wouldn't fair enough it only takes one
no i definitely saw the angels the lights on your screen
flicker when you said that they they were battling the demons that
that were trying to fight what you were saying um just being silly
no but uh the i think the whole point that airman saying is there's no
like there would be no suffering messiah
story okay so he's really trying to cut out the idea that this was really
um that this was really an invented or created narrative
rather than real history and dr bob's been on my show and he's pointed out
Old Testament narratives where you have the dying
suffering servant psalms chapter two with david
you have a suffering messiah idea in the Old Testament
and this is a narrative like you're talking about that's been going on
and all it is is a continuity of that except it's hitting a point where
they're trying to have a finality of the suffering messiah concepts
here wrapped up in this jesus and he said something else that kind of made me
think was like made me think that jesus is not an individual
he represents israel which was very interesting to me that he's not a guy
he is the nation so to speak uh you know in a sense there's some kind of allegory
there but i know dr bob also mentioned uh
he said that leviathan he said yaway actually fights leviathan in joe
and it's the god the storm god that battles the dragon
and what do we see with jesus you know in the in the
book of revelation we see another divinity type fighting the dragon idea
is like he's defeating the the that old serpent the the dragon the
liar and that theme is attached to jesus so
at this point we have to go okay if you hemorization is taking place
in my opinion this is just my opinion you start cutting off all the fat what do
you have left um was yaway a real guy so it's like
i know that's a huge leap but i'm just saying can you imagine
us trying to you hemorrhize like the the you hemorists did
by saying zeus and and Poseidon were ancient kings from way back in the day
then yaway must have been an ancient king at some point and jesus comes along as
a king and he it does say in the old testament
before israel asked for an earthly king that yaway was their king
and so jesus is coming on and he's replaced it seems like he's doing
something like the old testament mentions before by becoming the king of
israel in the same sense that yaway was originally king of israel so to speak
i i see a myth here man it's very hard to see history in this
i if this is if there's any history what is what is
at this point what is really it well so i don't think that revelation is
particularly helpful when looking at hystericity just because of how
late it is it's written what the 94 95 thereabouts
96 i thought but i could be very disconnected from
the actual history that we're looking at which is you know 20 years before
paul wrote that's what we're really interested in is that it was there a
guy around that time and i think that the
argument that jews wouldn't invent a suffering Messiah
is self-defeating because they did regardless of whether jesus existed or
not they still invented that story that narrative of the Messiah
you know the dying Messiah and there was even
a sect that placed him 100 years earlier i think
yeah it was a jewish sect i think like the was the
idiomites that said he was 100 bc or he was 70 something bc under a different
reigning emperor i can't remember but it's in the
town they put him under a different emperor i think yeah
but that's uh i don't trust my memory well enough to go into that in any
detail without looking at it properly that's wild man i can't
i don't know what to make of that dr bob's made that argument too when i
looked him up on wikipedia when i was originally looking into this
stuff i remember him making the claim and i've
heard this from acharya asked dea murdoch you know she said
when you peel away the onion all the layers of the onion
and he starts out that well that's that's definitely myth
okay that's mythology uh when you get there you realize you have no
nothing to pill at the end you have to go back i guess if you were
like in my mind to really really really be honest and not bias and really say
okay there's gotta be some history here you gotta go back to each layer of the
onion you peeled and look for the details in there
in that myth to try and suggest well i know that's shrouded in myth
but you know there was that emperor okay does talk about hair the great okay
that was a real guy okay so now you gotta pick parts out of the myth
and say well these are people these are places and these are things
that are real um and the argument i hear from
historicists will go like well let's see for example
john the baptist was real uh herod the great was real and you're going to
tell me jesus was it well how can these guys be real
yet jesus isn't what would you say to that
well john the baptist is also questionable but i think is more
solid than jesus uh in history but yeah obviously i think the usual
argument that's used as well new york is real but that doesn't make spider man
real um so you know it's very common in
historical fiction to take um markers people and just
weave them into the story um it's like forest gump you know load of the
events that forest gump walked into were real but he himself was a fictional
character um so it's it's quite easy to write fiction
that way in fact it's easier to write historical fiction that way because you
have these anchoring points and if you have a character who
systematically meets real people you start to think well this is
really narratively convenient to help the person's imagination because you're
bringing up people that they know from stories
but what are the odds that this one person that nobody's mentioned outside
this story actually did meet all of these people
it's like um the story of the hundred man you're a hundred year old man who
climbed out the window and disappeared he bumps into countless historical
figures uh you know he's he's met people all over the place
like joseph starlin general franco and so on i've obviously know that this is
fiction and we know that this is a fictional story
um but imagine if you took that story and then people started to say
later on they started worshiping this figure and started saying okay this
this alan karsten guy really did exist and the consensus of historians who
worshiped this particular guy also say he really existed
but then you have a couple of skeptical scholars who say well actually this
looks like fiction to me um if that was all you had left just that one book
with no trace of whether it was history or fiction and you can say well
these other historical figures did exist i mean how you're going to work out
whether he really did exist you'll have to look at the story itself and see what
the markets there were if you have no other evidence to work on
good point very very well said and um it gave me a different perception to
view that so so to be fair uh it's fair to just say
now we're saying well we think there was one but uh we're not sure
it's fair to be agnostic so to speak or leaning towards historicity if you're
going to be a historicity guy and saying it's possible he didn't though
we don't hear him say it's possible he didn't i don't hear that and
why don't we hear that why don't we at least hear that you know
there's very possible chance this is a fictional guy what's going on with that
joel
well so is with the case of jesus then yeah he is fictional regardless so
whether the guy existed or not um the only question is how fictional so which
which pieces can you rescue um and it's very difficult to find any piece that
you can nail down and say that's a real one because
everything has theological significance um i suppose you could probably find some
obscure uh areas where there doesn't appear to be a
theological significance but then we're not thinking the same way as people
you know two thousand years ago who wrote all the stuff down um and you and i
don't have the qualifications we don't have the contextual training we don't
have the languages so we can really only rely on the scholars involved but
even from their perspective they're still looking through you know a
couple millennia worth of um just corruption uh and just darkness so
we've got this veil where we don't know what was really happening we don't
know the context for sure we can only piece it together from the remaining
scraps that survived this moment and all of that's been through a heavy
filter of christian tampering over the years where
they haven't preserved anything that would go against their own
theological position so you know all we have left
is what christians allowed us to see and that means we have to be really
careful about what conclusions we draw from it
because obviously all the evidence remaining has a heavy christian bias
with the possible exception of finds um such as the nagamadi
uh library uh you know and um what was the other one there was um kumran
there's the dead sea scrolls but there was an akamadi they two they're the two
separate things uh bases that we don't know um i know
the dead sea scrolls or the kumran text there and then nagamadi but
there was another there was another discovery the mastic texts i think yes
that's the egyptian uh they found them buried in egypt i believe
it wasn't actually library that was it was a pot
yeah can you imagine how much we lost uh they smashed the pot when they first
found it as well yeah i just at the the library of
alexandria didn't burn down i think i honestly think we would all
have uh more at least more to play with for sure
because i wish we had more pagan i'm sure a lot's been destroyed but i would
like to see the enemies voices a lot more because
someone probably if if there wasn't a jesus let's just play a game
i like to play games if there wasn't a jesus it's and these guys were writing
and they were going dude this is the guy that was involved in this
you guys made this up i know his cousin okay
he told me you know probably i'm just saying there's probably there's probably
writings about the saying you guys are involved in the making of this
this myth oh and now you're pushing it on everybody
we're not buying it you know or whatever it makes me wonder if there's
something like that that may have been destroyed because
clearly we have enemies of the church written
in the actual letters already saying they thought this is mythology
and that this isn't real literal so something is starting to evolve they're
already starting to push that this is true in the literal sense and this is
my problem i've been going around trying to
explain to people i'm torn between this is allegory
and this is bs because to me you have okay i see a ton of allegory
in the new testament but if it weren't for the claims
of people saying no he he died and rose literally
from the dead okay if there was nowhere that demanded that
i would see this as much more of a beautiful text and that
there was no laid claims on this by suggesting the literalness
of these supposed events okay i'm torn between that you know because i
want to tell people hey this is this is literally
allegory and not an actual literal claim
problem is paul didn't do that well so you have to consider the motivations of
the author as opposed to any case
all right um so when you consider the motivation of the author
i think that's the key thing so when you're saying okay it's an allegory
or they're telling a literal story but what's the reason that they wrote
that's what point are they trying to get across
um so if you were going to tell a literal story even then you would choose the
story which has some meaning for you and we already know that this is
theology this isn't a history that they're writing so regardless of whether
jesus existed or not the stories you're going to get are going to be
theologically rooted stories especially given
how expensive it was to write a book and copy it and all that you're only going
to preserve the key stuff that actually is relevant to your
your threats to your theology so yeah so i i think the theology in the
gospels kind of doesn't make a difference as to
whether jesus did or didn't exist on that because they could make up stories
about am i the way or twist stories of things that did happen
into a theological point um so it always just leaves us back to the
other source and trying to figure out what paul was talking about
and i'd think that the historicist perspective really doesn't give enough
credence to the way paul does not give jesus a life
it's it's just they seem to skip over that step they seem to go there's a
couple of passages that ambiguously might have mentioned the historical jesus
but they ignore 99 of the text
see and and that approach i i have to say that i have a lot more respect for
that approach on the text versus trying to take a
literal historical one um if you believe in some angelic figure
or some celestial being so to speak i mean let's be honest they even consider
planets to be gods uh people would consider planets to be gods so
if jesus is the bride and morning star whatever that might be
to paul let's just say that is paul's idea i know that's a later
book of revelation idea or maybe even if you go in the old testament check out
the prophets and you're looking there um regardless
suppose it's some type of celestial being so to speak
um then i can look at this is allegory and go
okay okay they're not literally making the claim
that this is an actual literal guy who literally came
who literally was born through an actual literal virgin who literally
resurrected people from the dead healed the blind the sick blame them
all that's allegory and it has a deeper significant esoteric meaning for
people there's some good wisdom teachings there's some
good lessons um but it's just like anything else
paul bunion in the blue ox Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
there's deep meaning and lessons in this story
i would then appreciate it that much more i really would i'd say you know what
this is a relevant text it's got some really good stuff
that we can glean from it but when you have people on top of that
who have now monopolized this text have said this is the way it's going to be
it is you must believe he was born of a virgin you must believe that this
literal this the literal that the actual literal resurrection
and they have absolutely monopolized it now you're asking for
opposition for those who are thinking in a more rational
logical sense of of way of thinking if you will because
today you're going to get that opposition that's going to go hold on so
you're telling me god Yahweh sent a bear to mall 42 kids for calling a man
bald you know at what point do you stop and go
you know i'm painting myself into a corner claiming
all this literal miraculous and then i now have to defend myself
against every worldview out there by suggesting mine's the correct one and
all these other are allegories or myths or this
mine isn't even though it looks exactly like those in so many ways
the only difference is the earliest church fathers
they said it's rooted in true history this is the literal what really happened
eyewitnesses really said i think they messed up on that one man
has caused so much damage
well so i don't think that mysticism and the textual criticism of the bible
is the best way to approach dealing with people who literally believe the truth
of it because that's a question really for epistemology
so that's something that i would deal with in a more general case of logic
and you know learning how evidence works and how i just have to think rationally
so that's not really where i would go with them trying to deal with supernatural
claims because people will bounce around constantly from one to another you have
to nail them down to the basics and go to epistemology for that
and for the wisdom in the bible in the new testament in particular
i don't think there's anything particularly profound that jesus came up
with so the jesus character has words put in
this mouth probably the best one was the woman caught in adultery but then
that's not even original to the bible that was a later edition
something i first learned from reading ermine
and also there's nothing he said that wasn't said better by say confucius or
500 years earlier or even uh i think there was an egyptian golden rule
even earlier than that
all i'm saying is is those teachings even though we do have them being brought
in from outside sources it's still beautiful um there's
still some good lessons you can glean i'll give you an example um
you know i mentioned this the other day that buddha in his story had an enemy
you know how you have satan in the new testament he had an enemy and buddha's
enemy came and offered him power um he offered him these
these things materials of the world offering him these things
and the buddha resisted that temptation where as jesus did the same thing
he offers him you know eat turn this this stone into bread he's hungry you know
physical material uh he says you know these kingdoms of the
earth he finally says actually tells him hey jump down and your angels
will take care of you and then hey all the kingdoms of the earth i'll give you
the power right outer material uh and power and he denies that power
there's something good about that in my opinion there's something you can glean
out of that story that also the buddha teaches i only say that because of
being a recovering addict myself um i realize that uh that i don't have to
find power out there in the world i already had it and i always tell
this to people when i got clean i prayed i did i legitimately prayed when i got
clean asking this what was going on in my head as i thought the universe is
trying to say something to me but you know about uh you know how the brain
works okay the brain's an amazing thing and scientists
starting to realize this more and more i now look back and go you know what that
divine source that helped me was always in me and it probably was me
you see there was a place within myself that i was tapping into
and so that type of teaching i know buddhas that are atheist
they don't believe in a creator they but they do believe the divine is within
them that they are it and so uh there's this weird interesting thing there
and so i could see a teaching like that being useful
but when you couple that with here's our doctrines here's our creeds
um we just burnt your cousin at the stake because he doesn't believe in a
trinity he believes in unitarianism what yeah that's right
the trinity is recruited by that temptation claim anyway
because if they say well jesus was fully god the whole time then that wasn't
temptation at all so jesus um the temptation stories and
the narratives come from the times before jesus was fully god so before
the uh the john's version of jesus for example
um so that would be the adoptionist sort of mark version of jesus where he's
still just a guy and still susceptible and vulnerable
and then doesn't get um transported into godhood until later on
although i think erwin points out how jesus sort of gradually in the different
gospels moves further and further back as to where he starts
because in uh mark's gospel the spirit comes on him at the baptism
but then by the time you get to mass use then he's gone further back and it's
his virgin birth and that's the time when he becomes
the messiah and then you get all the way to john where he goes right back to the
beginning where he was always there from the beginning and you know the beginning
was the word and using this uh logo theology
so it just it ruins the whole trinity story because
if you throw out the context in which the gospel was written
uh when jesus was supposed to be an ordinary guy with something a bit
special about the spirit of god with him if you go for the fully god thing
then it just ruins that entire story and you're going well this isn't temptation
at all
oh man i love this this is so funny so i i i definitely need to read erin's uh
i bought it on audible.com is the uh uh
what's the game going no no he he shows that they're forgeries the forgeries he
oh uh yeah there's forged um and then there's forgery in caps forgery
i think it's forged yeah forged is like the pop culture one it's the one i
read first but if you want to go even further in
depth then forgery and counter forgery is like the academic version of that
book where he goes even further into depths uh it's really fascinating a
lot of it goes up in my head but i'm sure that i need to start with the basic
stuff man because it'll probably lose me i'm so
busy with so many things um that i do do it's very
difficult to just sit on one thing i'm juggling this youtube channel i juggle
my other youtube channel i also have the kids the wife i
help drug addicts um a lot and so yeah so i have a hard time i gotta
keep it simple um yeah so i'm playing with family and
work and trying to read as many things as possible
i actually am planning and i'm trying to get to our audience uh to maybe help
out if possible but i want to get carrier and dr bob on to do a
show on the celestial christ and really go into
the the the heavenly angelic jesus figure um and really show paul's jesus so
i really want them to spend two hours on a show it's going to cost us some money
to get both of them on to spend that time to go deep
i want them to go before we'll plan the show out so they can get all their
notes together and be prepared to bring the heaviest evidence that they can to
prove as much as possible that jesus is a
celestial being and where it comes from
and how it's it's rooted in old testament because we could show
we can show that uh you know that there's elements that the
the new testament's just borrowing and copying from the old and if paul says
he learned about his christ or his he learned these things from the old
testament and from revelation we need to show that we need to
prove without a shadow of a doubt that that's the best
position to take rather than this real historical guide becoming god
it seems that that he's you hemorrhized from an angel
and then from the you hemorrhization they make him divine and man
so i'd be interested in seeing uh that evidence what what do you think of that
um yeah i donated a bit to that fundraiser as well
um it's something that i think they would probably disagree on a lot and i
think uh it would be very easy for two scholars to go
down deep into one particular point and then just argue about the point back
and forth for a while so it might be best to have some sort of
agenda to hit multiple points just to make sure you actually have enough time
to get through everything i want to look through
oh well we we're refereeing we're not going to let it get too stuck
i have to get the point across for those who've watched and they've heard the
mockeries that even in the debate with airman airman mocked the
ufo jesus he likes to act like the outer space
uh alien jesus you know and like they they want to mock the whole
mythosist idea that it's a celestial heavenly jesus um
i want to i want to bring that one across as the celestial sperm bank thing
they like to do yeah trying to come in as well
what's interesting though is that uh mythosists don't do the same thing the
other way around so you can see um
historicists trying to um what would you say doing
argument of mad absurdum or just trying to strongman another argument is
trying to find a way to make it sound as ridiculous as possible when you're
making your case whereas mythosists don't need to do that
you can just say okay maybe there was the historical jesus we'll just go with
the really basic historical jesus we don't need to say
are you guys believe in the magic jesus you know
we just say okay maybe those are basic jesus behind that we don't need to
make a caricature out of it already um so although to be fair there is bad
mythosism out there and i try and stamp down on that as well
especially the zeitgeist stuff when i see that around
i'm just trying to push people towards the middle of the debate if they're
too far in either direction yeah i definitely agree i mean if you're
going to make an argument on syncretism for the non-existence of jesus
uh there's more to it than just saying oh look there
here's some outside sources being used in the bible that wouldn't be the case i
would make to try and prove that jesus didn't exist i guess
the strongest thing i could think of by going to outside sources
the argument um the argument that carrier makes
showing mythological people and then comparing the hero archetype
to jesus so or using jesus in that and showing numbers but
it's all probability it doesn't prove one way or the other ultimately
that could be part of the mythology that was added to the guy it's just um
the onion peel away the onion and how much of it do you have left
you know and i get it i've i've seen some um
mythosists who come out at historicists but i think it's more in defense
because historicists do come out mocking and it's like one of those things
once again where's your tinfoil hat you know
because you don't believe jesus really exists or you think that
he probably did not exist based off of the evidence we have
hit where's your tinfoil hat uh the earth is flat
you know you know watch out for the vaccine you know whatever
yeah the thing is this um i do see them compared to flat earth quite a lot
i think if a historicist is resorting to insults then they've already lost
um you know they they're not taking the argument seriously it just means that
you're gonna get the rug called from under them when you go to the actual
evidence uh and it can be the case that some of them
know the argument well enough that they can make their case
but by starting out using fallacies uh you know they're not starting on strong
footing so they're gonna have to make up ground from that point so yeah i don't
take offense to it um when i get insulted and it does
happen from time to time and i usually just say well if you
want to do a real debate let's do a real debate
if you're just gonna throw around insults and not take it seriously then
you've just made no case uh we could just leave it there
yeah i i get it i'd like to i one thing i've seen
is that they talk about from the majority how scholars
that don't agree any real scholar would would believe that historically a
jesus existed where does carrier and dr bob like
dr carrier and dr bob play a part in this do you know where
i mean like when you hear that argument and we throw back hey
we have two phd's now they're not his well carrier if i'm not mistaken he is a
roman historian if i'm not mistaken correct um yeah
historian of science and the classics i think he doesn't fit in the same
vein though i mean like if you use these two scholars
and you say well look uh dr uh airman we've got dr bob we've got dr carer
here they're both of them are uh phd's in the field
they're not to be taken serious is that is that how they view them i mean like
what is it that uh well it's it's ironic on that because
carrier is more qualified than airman uh because at least carrier is a historian
whereas airman is a textual critic now to be fair airman does a lot of research
and he does um you know he does loads of stuff
about early christianity because obviously that's been his focus
but yeah technically carrier is more qualified than airman in this
regard because at least he has a durian history this phd is an actual history
um but the thing is arguing credentials back and forth or arguing numbers
back and forth really doesn't make much difference
the key is the actual evidence and the methodology so as long as you bring a
sound methodology to it and you can make your case this is something that will
never be settled for nothing it's something which people can always take
one side or the other because the evidence is so weak
um so the best you can do is make up your own mind on it talk to each other
and and figure out between you what you think is reasonable
try and change each other's mind or try and change your own mind as you pick up
new pieces of information you didn't know before
and there's a whole wealth of background information that you can go into
it takes a lot to try and understand the context i don't understand the
historical context the best i can do is rely on what the scholars tell me
and compare them to each other and compare the evidence that they're citing
in order to make their conclusions um but there's something that carrier said
in i think it was proving history it may have been in on the histories of
the jesus where he said okay we're told that
there's this consensus where we're told um you know all these historians
believe that jesus existed but then you look at what do they
actually believe about him and they all contradict each other
there are as many jesus is out there as there are historians investigating
so there isn't a consensus really there's a consensus that
you know that this is elit jesus existed or that this failed apocalyptic
prophet jesus existed so when you look it up closer it
turns from a consensus into just a mess it's there
so many different jesus are scattered all over the place and everyone reads their
own personal opinion into it where they pick out what they think the real
jesus was just happens to match their own beliefs
so yeah i don't even consider it a consensus it's only a consensus if you
take back and look at the large scale view but the second you try and go into
it in detail and also um all the effort that's been put into finding out about
jesus is probably one of the most studied people in history
and we're still no closer in fact the more they study it the further the
ideas of jesus diverge people go down different paths
so yeah it just if there's a historical person really there
you would expect that to become clearer and clearer and focus in on one person
as you examine them whereas what you get with jesus is to get worse and more
spread out and that makes me want to ask the question
how many times have we heard the comparisons of well look they deified
the caesar caesar augustus he was deified but how many scholars
all have differing opinions on who this caesar augustus is
how i mean like and i get it i get it he's not nearly as mythologized
all right but nonetheless i don't think for every historian of caesar augustus
or that that delves into this topic they all go to lunch and argue all day about
the differences between how they view caesar augustus i very much doubt
that it's that spread out whereas with this it makes you already think the
reason they cannot get to the bottom of the barrel
is because there's so many different sects of christianity involved in the
in this text already trying to you believe that kind of all right we're
going to add that into this text we want to mold a text to fit
a variety of different ideas for different sects
and to be fair that's where you would lose this possible historical guy but
at the same time it's also like where's the real history at all
in all of this so if there was a jesus like dr bob said i'm going to quote him
not verbatim but he says if there was a jesus we don't know anything about him
now literally we have no jesus left because they
have written him out there's there's no way to know
so do you have it's a point that um ermine brought up about the
gospels where we keep saying the gospels as if there's a central story but
every single one of those gospels is fighting against the other ones they're
all four different stories and he says read them side by side and try and
trace the stories and you will find just constant contradictions between them
and especially with john who just goes off on his own is a completely different
storyline um so yeah there isn't a single coherent picture of jesus and
that's why they come up with so many different ones especially when you start
bringing Paul back into it because then you've got
jesus is all over the place it's um you can bring up a different aspect of
him to make a different theological and there isn't really much of a jesus in
paul anyway so you can you can say how much of that is jesus and how much is
paul is there any jesus and there is it all paul
good point joel good point it's so many questions man and there's so much more
to learn um i'm picking up more books as time
goes and and chiseling away at this subject
i'm remaining uh i guess you'd say this one at the moment
oh yeah how how is that one going so far that's great fun
and uh dr bob has a good sense of humor so i'm enjoying it he really does
he really does man um i like i gotta get him back on again soon too but uh
yeah i haven't had time to check that book out yet i need to uh he did a show
where he talked about some of the stuff you know on my channel
about the book i watched that show and i bought that book
yeah are you gonna write anything at some point
um i don't think i have the patience to sit down and write a whole book but you
never know and maybe if i pick a subject i think it's
everything i know about these subjects i learn from people who are better
experts on it than me so i think well they're the guys who should be writing
the books on this uh but yeah maybe someday i'll
consider myself well read enough to put my own thoughts to paper
okay and like you know maybe david first gerald for example because he's not a
phd historian on this but he's really good at picking up all these different
facts together putting them into an interesting and fun way of
expressing them and putting the book out i think he's done a great job with that
yeah even dr bob said he's learned from david Fitzgerald
so it's uh and i say that because you know he's phd and
david is good at finding clues that makes sense and he's got a different
perception so he sees things differently in many ways
man i enjoyed this uh do you have anything you'd like to close this with
uh i'd like to say go and read david Fitzgerald's books as well
yeah and this is mything in action right well yeah so mything in action is
three volumes you've got nailed as well and um the book about the Mormons was
good uh what was it called the um
the skeptics or the heretics guides to uh western religion uh his book on the
Mormons was fascinating like the history of Joseph
just gonna look it up even and the thing is he doesn't grow
so one thing that writers can do on this is they can take
ideas and just run with them so like um carrier s for example
or dm mode i think her other name was i forget which one was the pseudonym
but so sometimes she didn't check facts whereas i found with david Fitzgerald's
work that he does actually check what he's writing and he doesn't go off and
be found into crazy ideas he actually uh goes to the sources and finds out what's
really there well it's the Mormons by david
Fitzgerald the complete heretics guide western religion book one
and it's on kendall for six dollars and sixty six
cents so for all of you evil people who side with the angel of light
that is there right now with joel piercin trying to protect him from all
the vibes of positivity i'm sending his way
you know go get that book there too guys i love this question um
it's it's a i guess it's like you can get bored of a subject once you know
everything about it this subject is so thorough and so vast
you can't really know everything there is to know about it
there's a different angle you can always see there's always a little crevice or
crack i've noticed as i delve into this that
ooh that's a good point and it adds more to this whole thing
hopefully we discover more evidence if there is a jesus a real historical one
i would love for us to find uh stronger evidence uh just shut us up
for good and then we just side with them and say you know man this was one hell
of a mythology that was written around around the sky
and uh if there isn't a historical jesus i would like also to see
possible further documentation that we could find
showing uh maybe a pre first century uh jesus figure like we've tapped into a
little with phylo if that's even usable or an old testament jesus that's been
mentioned if that's even usable i only say that because
some argue that that's not to be used um but maybe there's something there that
we find that that gives us more clues on the mythology
or the mythicist view of of jesus and uh who knows i'd like to answer this
question one day before my life is up and i'm sure you would
mind figuring out what's really going on too that'd be cool in our lifetime after
two thousand years to really get to the bottom of who or what this is
well although there's quite a lot of evidence there i would say most of it
is context the actual evidence for jesus is very sparse
um so yeah although it is a vast subject the vast majority of it is peripheral
uh you get down to the roots of what evidence we really have for jesus and
you've got basically the gospels and the epistles
good point good point joe how do they get a hold of you
um i mean there's a telephone number is no i'm just kidding
best way is is the mythicist versus historical uh is it mystical jesus versus
historical jesus facebook group um which is on this context to be best place to
just talk to us about this because of course you're in the group as well and we have some
um a lot of interested people and interesting people in that group going back and forth on
this question yeah both sides very intelligent people um the the groups in the description
of all my videos uh believe i put it in all my videos now so you guys can come and join the
discussion um and and yeah there's there's both sides pull me back and forth i've had guys on
the show that are historicists i've had guys on the show that are mythicists and i'm kind of like
going between the two so thanks for joining me brother and uh
yeah we'll see you in that group i guess and uh hopefully luther can come back because luther
asks such uh more profound questions they might be the same questions in a way that i asked but he
says them so much better than i do he's poetic with it you know so yeah i'd like to talk to him
again he's a fun guy oh we're gonna have you back on too uh well this was a cool from the hip
having fun type show and thanks for joining me here in myth vision brother thanks um all right
together we've got to do this we oh myth vision all right y'all we'll see you again thanks for joining us
you
