We are MythVision, your host Derek Lambert, thank you for joining, checking out this show.
I have Jim Majors with us today. How's it going, brother?
Hey, Derek, it's going good, man. Thanks for having me.
Awesome, man. Thank you for joining me. I look forward to this show. I'm going to be learning
a lot from you on the martyrdom of the apostles and the ideas of persecution and things like that
with them. You know, it's a common thing. But before we do, I want to let everyone know that
Jim Majors here is a PhD candidate in Oklahoma, has a master's in theology on New Testament studies.
He is writing his dissertation on Daniel and should present it sometime within the next year or so.
Give or take, COVID's a pain in the butt, and he's working on this. I've talked to him on the phone,
and we had a pretty good, long conversation. He knows a thing or two, trust me. You guys,
make sure you go down in the description. He has a YouTube channel. He's trying to grow.
You can subscribe and go like his videos, comment on his videos, show him support,
and he's on Twitter at the Jim Majors. It's one word, at the Jim Majors,
and that'll be in the description as well. You guys can check him out. So, Jim, we were both Christians,
man. Yeah, I'm super stoked to be here, man. I really enjoyed our conversation and looking forward
to getting into this. Yeah, you started scratching the surface and I was like, pump the brakes.
This is too good to not be recording. And I decided, let's really jump on this. You're going to be,
I hope, a reoccurring guest on this channel and to help grow your channel, of course, too,
because this information needs to get out there. You are in the framework of scholarship here.
And so what you try to stick with is the up-to-date peer-reviewed literature, up-to-date consensus
on topics and ideas and testing things, not saying you necessarily side with everything that comes
out, but you are reading it. You are sticking to what's going on currently. And we were both Christians
at one point. Yeah, that's correct. I was a Pentecostal. I was a Pentecostal pastor. I went to
seminary as a Christian. Wow. So did you do the whole gibberish thing? Yeah, I spoke in tongues
first time I spoke in tongues. I was 14 years old. Yeah. And then, well, before I spoke in tongues,
I remember going to my grandparents' church one summer and they lived in Texas. I was in
Southern Louisiana at this time. And they were Southern Baptist and went into their church and
you know, sat down and the opening hymn was leaning on the everlasting arms. And dude, that was my jam.
Like, I get up, everybody stands up. I start clapping my hands. All I had was a piano. You know,
they didn't have a guitar and a tambourine and people stomping, you know, like in the Pentecostal
church. They didn't have no drums, but we had a lot of bass. But all they rose was just an organ,
just a piano, and playing, leaning on the everlasting arms. But I start singing and clapping
my hands and put my hands up in the air and start feeling the Holy Ghost, you know, coming on me.
And I'm looking around and everybody's looking at me like I'm a frog, man. Like, what is this
kid doing? Yeah. And I was like, well, why aren't these people worshiping? What is what is going on
here? And that was the first little loop that that threw me there was actually just just experiencing
another Christian Christian worship service. I was in the same boat very young when I started
to they were like, the utterances will just come. But I'm listening to them do it. And they're going
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Do they ever grab your head and shake it and say, let loose?
I think that we've done that a lot of times we did that when we were trying to cast out demons
because they consider demons. Yeah, like the way that they looked at demons and spirits was like
if you had a masturbation problem, or if you had like anger problem, that was a spirit. So
everything had a spirit. It wasn't like, and then most people don't get this, like especially
even like other Christians that don't even know this like everything is spiritual everything and so
we were like cast and I'm gonna leave you spirit of lust spirit of gluttony spirit of lie you
know all that kind of stuff and so everything had a freaking spirit like they had a different book
for this if you got caught doing something if you got caught backsliding on saturday on sunday
man people were around you laying hands on you and praying for you and some of me been beating
you with pillowcases weird stuff man so my my question and i had this conversation with you
on the phone briefly was on martyrdom i really am fascinated with this topic because christian
apologetics are often deployed to uh use the example of saying would someone really die for
something they knew wasn't true and that's usually how they they frame it they frame it in a way
where uh they don't really open up the conversation and really i could give examples like even if
martyrdom was true i can give examples of martyrdom from jihadist that do things in the name of their
god that believe what they're doing sure and so even if at the end of the day before we even get
into the mythology of some of the stuff and some of the exaggerated claims and all that um i just
wanted to point out if you at the end of the day say no i really think all these people were martyred
blah blah blah it doesn't change a thing it doesn't it's cognitive dissonance could easily
play a huge role in why people do what they do but anyway no yeah i i absolutely agree i mean
you know the christian apologists uh they like to ask or they like to use the the excuse or the
apologetic uh well the apostles wouldn't die for a lie you know they they wouldn't die for something
that they that they knew to be a lie um and they just assumed that all the apostles were were
martyred uh why because that's that's what it takes for them to to have their belief that that's
that's tradition uh people believe a lot of things for unjustified reasons and a lot of
his church tradition and a lot of it i mean we're going to get into right now um a lot of christians
that believe in the martyrdom of the apostles they they aren't they they don't know what source
it's from they don't know what it's dated to they don't know um the the manuscript evidence that we
have for it the manuscript tradition that we have for it um or or anything else about about
the text they don't they don't care that it's apocryphal or or whatever it's just because it's
church tradition and and you found some serious strange things discrepancies issues which anyone
who reads as far and as wide as you have and sees these things will probably scratch their head too
most christians stay within the framework of the canon of course but uh you know there's so much
more out there and we were talking about papias and it was like oh my goodness the exaggerated
claims this guy comes up with about judas and all these things so uh can we start somewhere with
with some of these exaggerated claims or some of the things you'd like to bring that you've
investigated in this in this field sure uh so i've put put together all of the information
that that i've had i've done a video on this before it was a live stream so it was you know
like three hours long it was ridiculous i don't even think i got through the whole thing um so
i just want to say when it comes to determining the historicity of the martyrdom of the apostles
there are so many different sources uh from so many different people and they're telling us so
many different things and they're all spread out across a broad timeline uh so for simplicity's sake
i've attempted to divide uh when applicable uh the information into four different categories
that we get so we got the the new testament tradition if it does appear in the in the new
testament for the the martyrdom of an apostle uh the church tradition uh what is traditionally
accepted as uh the the place time and method of uh of martyrdom if if at all um the earliest
references um to it uh to the the uh to the the traditional explanation and then later legendary
developments um uh so Sean McDowell wrote a book called the fate of the apostles um
Sean McDowell's a christian uh apologist um but this is probably one of my favorite books on
the apostles or on martyrdom persecution of early christianity anything like that this is a really
really good book um and i just want to want to quote something in there okay and Sean McDowell
says that the the willingness of the apostles to face persecution and martyrdom indicates their
sincere conviction that jesus appeared to them after his death and he goes on to say the apostles
willingness to die for their belief does not demonstrate the inherent truth of the christian
message but that the apostles really believe that jesus had risen from the grave right
and uh later in the book he says to to be honest talking about the uh the the the martyrdom of uh
of peter he says to be honest the hit the historical evidence is late it's legend filled
and contradictory for the rest of the apostles and this is a christian yes yes the christian
apologies he's not uh some uh secular christian or some some critical or liberal christian right
right right and not not a critical scholar at all very very conservative see this this fascinates
me because it gets right to the heart of the issue i mean everyone who looks at this goes
would they really die for this well let me ask you this and i know that you let's not spend
three or four hours if we can trying to go into some of this i'm sure you have it diluted down
we can give a summary we can do deeper focused topics you know on the subject and do a video
series but i'll go ahead i just remembered that that quote it wasn't um two it was one about just
peter but uh peter james and paul those are the three that that uh that shawn mcdowell
thinks that we have the that we have good evidence to suggest that that it that they were
they were killed they were he says martyred but i'm going to give in to why it's not
martyred them um later on um but he says that besides that the historical evidence is late
it's legend filled and it's contradictory for the rest of the apostles so all the apostles besides
peter james and paul let's center on them for now because it's obvious you you even have
discrepancies here uh like unbelievable tells about paul's death you gave a hint at yesterday
and i'm like okay take us through some of this if you don't mind well i'll do i'll tell you what
i'll do uh peter and i'll do james but i'm gonna save paul for last because it's just too good man
okay okay okay okay so uh peter uh also called uh simon peter or uh simon bariona um it was later
given the name uh kphos uh by jesus it's uh from the air aramaic for rock or stone kpho
which is translated the greek is petra petros and then translating to english simon petros simon
petros became simon peter uh he was the brother of andrew um the earliest reference to his death
or what could be said to be his martyrdom is uh john 21 18 uh is the the only new testament
reference uh to his death or to his martyrdom uh it says uh it's supposedly it's jesus predicting
the crucifixion of peter and jesus says fairly truly i tell you when you were younger you used to
fasten your own belt and go wherever you wished but when you grow old you will stretch out your
hands and someone else will fasten the belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go um
but so which traditionally peter is said to have been crucified upside down in rome uh the earliest
reference that we had to that um is so john doesn't say anything about crucifixion just says
that somebody's going to take you where you do not want to go and then not until the second
century and the acts of peter the apocryphal acts of peter do we uh do we we get that uh we have
earlier references um that talk about the uh uh that just say that he was crucified but
the tradition was that he was crucified upside down um so that's acts of peter's late late second
century um so it has this really funny dialogue in there uh it says as he went forth to the city
he saw the lord entering into rome so peter's going into the city to be to be crucified or i'm
sorry no he just he was going going into rome and he's going into rome and he sees in rome and he
sees jesus and it says and when he saw him he said lord wither goes thou thus or here
so he's like he's like lord what what are you where are you going and the lord said into him
i go into rome to be crucified and peter said into him lord aren't that being crucified again
he said into him yay peter i am being crucified again and peter came to himself and hadn't
beheld the lord ascending up into heaven he returned to rome rejoicing and glorifying the lord
and said i am being crucified so the prediction in john 21 says that somebody will put a belt around
you and take you where you do not go and in the earliest tradition or in the earliest textual
evidence uh in the earliest text that backs up the the tradition of him being crucified upside
down in the acts of peter he's not being drug kicking in screen where he doesn't want to go he
is joyfully walking in the room into into rome throwing his hands at saying i'm being crucified
because he gets to follow jesus wow so that to me you got to scratch that one off the evidence
when he when josh mcdowell makes this argument so to speak he needs to back up for a second and
not use that so all he has is john uh what else is there to bolster this claim that peter died and
we can know he was martyred for believing in this right well it doesn't say that he was killed for
his for his belief it doesn't say that he was killed for being a christian
um origin says uh origin agrees with uh the the method he's from the the early third he's
writing at the in the early third century um he agrees that peter was crucified upside down
and he said it was because uh peter felt unworthy to be uh crucified in the same manner as his lord
and so at his own request was crucified with his head downward but uh i believe in the acts of peter
he says something about him uh um coming into the world head first or head down um and that's
he wanted to get that perspective again interesting right yeah yeah that is interesting what the heck
he's happy to die but then what's also strange is jesus is being crucified again it's like
you know what the heck yeah yeah like he came down to earth and no ministry or anything he just
felt like reliving old times let me just get crucified again bucky yeah i forgot what it felt like
i just wanted just wanted just wanted i haven't haven't stretched that good in a long time i just
didn't get that stretch out do you think origin is looking at the um what is this which uh document
is this that the acts of peter the acts of peter is he looking at this you think uh almost certainly
he's aware of it um i mean it was written around the time he was born uh actually probably a little
bit before the time he was born um and yeah i don't see why he wouldn't wouldn't be be aware of it
it was a fairly popular text before we get into anything else on this i just want to ask did the
is the church relying on these pseudographical writings to to bolster their tradition yes yes
sometimes you'll have later uh later medieval renditions of it uh you know you'll have a fifth
six seventh even later renditions where they just completely change it but keep the core tradition
just because they don't want it to be associated with a with a a heretical apocryphal text
they can't let go can they wow it's like we talked about with the preterism the other day you
know the kingdom of god and if it didn't physical manifest man we gotta keep this kingdom of god
thing how can we make it work you know although one of the early church fathers you see this in the
fourth century uh he's actually really against these apocryphal texts and he talks against them
but he whenever he speaks against them he almost always first records the story and then changes
some things and then he says oh they're heretical and they're untrustworthy we can't we can't trust
these these texts so he does that with the the acts of with the acts of peter and he does that with
with several more i'll i'll point him out as we go along okay see so who was who was next uh
james james okay so let's see james james the son of zebedee uh james the son of son of zebedee
brother of john son of zebedee uh the traditional view is that he was beheaded with a sword by king
harried a grip of the first in jerusalem in the year 44 ce just before the day of Passover
so this the the earliest is found in acts 12 uh verses one through two uh it says it was about
this time that king harried arrested some who belong to the church intending to persecute them
he had james the brother of john put to death with the sword uh there was no mention of the crime or
and given an option to recant or anything like anything like that pavius talks about him later
but the the acts of the apostles is really the only uh reference that we had to that um it's
some say that it's implied in the gospel of of mart so this is number two on uh shon mcdowell's
list of the the the top three uh that he believes uh most likely are historical uh so we had peter
james and then we have paul next but we're gonna we're gonna save paul all right now this is not
james the brother of jesus or is it um so it gets confusing i know right so there's several people
that are named uh james um and in early christian uh history and in the new testament text um and
there's a lot of uncertainty over who's which uh because of uh the identification there's there's
actually um inconsistencies amongst the gospels um he's the so he's usually called james the
greater um and then you have james the less who is the the son of altheas um it's what he's he's
known as and james son of altheas is the one who was traditionally known as the brother of of jesus
um and and if he is the brother of jesus um he was uh stoned by Pharisees uh according to
josephus and hippolytus um they they both say that he was uh he was stoned um but really
hippolytes is just seconding josephus hippolytes is aware of josephus he's just aiming josephus
so as the history of that i mean we we really don't know but there's not a whole lot of tradition
to compare it to so it's it's one of the most consistent makes sense that does make sense so
what happened to this guy you you were talking about james and this guy was beheaded yes james the
son of zebedee yeah he was uh supposedly beheaded uh with a sword by king herod a grip of the first
in jerusalem and the year 44 c just before the day of Passover that like they they get really
really specific with it okay dig into this one because i keep thinking of john the baptist being
beheaded and i keep thinking about paul supposed you know situation like i'm like it's weird is
everybody getting beheaded and stoned to death out here or what and some are crucified so it's
like okay right right i mean there's there's a lot of a lot of variants in it like i said that
there's a lot of different traditions i mean but all what i what i split up into is like what is the
tradition the church tradition is that he was beheaded by by the sword uh by by herod a grip
but you know we and we have that uh we have acts um to to back it up but other than that i mean
not a whole lot i mean we don't have anything that that we can say this is this is absolutely
historical i mean we have Josephus um but we we know how how reliable you know that that
tends to be and then Hippolytes is really just uh just using uh Josephus as a as a primary source
and are these the only sources that we have of anything mentioning this same James or
are there some crazy or later ones that change the story or have a different opinion or
there's some spurious ones that talk about you know his life and things like that but as to
his his martyrdom specifically um that's that's really all that i that i that i picked out were
the ones that were specifically hinted towards martyrdom or or death of of some sort
um you have uh so that was James the son of zebedee uh then uh you have his brother John
son of zebedee uh so the earliest one that we have to him is is the same reference that is
that was given to James uh to James son of zebedee is it's implied in the gospel of Mark
then you have a papias that says that he was martyred doesn't say how he was martyred or
or anything like that um then you have the acts of john um was written about 50 years after papias
would have would have written of course we don't have any any any existing texts of of papias but
the the acts of john are written around at the end of the second century like 170 to 200 somewhere
around there um and they say that he died a natural death in Ephesus of old age um
and then you have a tertulian tertulian is writing at the end of the second century as well
and he says that john was and this is the the church tradition uh tertulian says that john
was sentenced to death by emperor domitium and he was to be boiled to death in a vat of oil like
they would they would heat the vat up until it was boiling and to get oil to boil it's like
twice the the the temperature that it takes it takes water so it has to be twice as hot as water
to boil it that's like twice the boiling point so it's super hot and then they have a huge crowd
around they lower john into the vat and nothing he just just chill and then he starts praising god and
then he starts praying and then he starts blessing everybody he starts preaching to everybody so he's
gathering a larger crowd so seconds minutes go by and so finally they're they just they they pull
him out and they just they just give up and so instead domitium uh sends him uh in exile to the
isle of patmos uh where he allegedly wrote the uh wrote a revelation uh and eventually according
to tradition another emperor a later emperor pardoned john and he was able to uh live to an
very old age uh in his late 90s according to tradition and he died in natural death
he was not martyred at all dang he didn't get the lucky glorious ending all the other guys got
right and this is supposedly the the beloved disciple this is this is this is Jesus's beloved
this is supposed to be his uh his right hand man dude i can't imagine that oil though i mean like
right right it's like a shadrack me shack and a bendigo rewrite so to speak you know
yeah yeah but i don't know i think i'd rather the furnace yeah i mean i don't know what's quicker
let's just go ahead and get it over with oh man like but i mean imagine being lowered in feet first
like you you find out it's hot like way before it kills you dude i can't imagine something like that
but they it also i think i had to request and uh to do me peter style and just flip me
i'm probably reading too much into this but it reminds me of the um the fiery lake furnace
that uh zoroastrianism has where the righteous yeah the righteous are dipped into the fire but
it's like yeah it's like warm milk to them it's like nothing right it uh it it redefines them
yeah and that's it that's it it's like it doesn't do anything bad and so
i don't know if that i mean i could be reading way into that i'm just throwing it out there that
who knows i mean i'm i'm no no expert because it's zoroastrianism i mean i just i i read it
just as a hobby as a side thing i'm uh so some scholarly texts but i mean i don't really get
into the the research side of it but i mean from i mean it sounds right um there's a couple of other
sources that mention uh that mentioned john and how how he died um uh the the acts of john the
theologian has written sometime after the third century between the third and the fifth century
couldn't really find a a a good dating on that uh say that he just just vanished just gone just
disappeared nobody ever heard from him again um and of course tertullian says that he died in
natural death uh poly crates um of of of emphasis in the late second century uh writing about the
time tertullian maybe a little bit before uh says a natural death in emphasis that he died natural
death um iranaeus in uh in the mid to late second century a little bit before poly crates said
natural death in in in emphasis so this is one of the the more consistent ones uh however they
don't say that he was boiled in a in a vat of oil first um that's that's uh something something
later and there's there's other spurious texts that that talk about uh uh how he was tortured in
other ways uh somebody tried to flay him and they couldn't and a bunch of other things but
way way too spurious yeah i've heard of that one they peeled the skin off slowly or something like
oh yeah well they they they tried to but i think they they couldn't cut his skin or something like
that what the heck that's crazy yeah oh my gosh okay okay um so are are you ready for a crazy one
i want i'm dude i'm that's exactly what i was about to say i'm like okay go ahead and drop the
bomb on us i'm gonna throw you now i'm gonna throw you a good one it's almost good but not quite
okay okay go ahead go ahead so we got we got philip right i was hung upside down uh he was
crucified upside down he was hung by the the iron hooks through his ankles uh how is this
he was hung on a tree with irons in his heels and ankles not not like on but in um this is by
the romans in hierapolis and it was it wasn't because he was a christian but it's because he had this
this conflict with these snake worshipers this they were worshiping this this this snake deity in
hierapolis um and so while he's upside down he curses everyone and in a this this this massive
chasm this massive hole opens up and it swallows the procounsel who crucified him the viper temple
the the priest of the temple and uh everybody and seven thousand men that were around the temple
and plus women and children uh and this is where where uh or philip is is crucified as well
being hung upside down uh and the hole closes up and then jesus appears gets better jesus appears
and he says philip you shouldn't have done that i'm gonna punish you um i will not allow you into
heaven for 40 days after you died today uh for 40 days you will be tortured outside of the gates
of heaven and then you may come in that's so ridiculous isn't it like he didn't have a problem
destroying pagan stuff in the old testament like philip thought it was cool i mean yeah
yeah like dude uh what happened you and your dad were on the same page i thought right you know
and it's i i love that meme there's a funny meme with jesus praying and he's like um dear father
me you are some crap like he is his own father that he's praying to himself um but no yeah that's
it's so funny how he changes his mind is so to speak by acting like that's a problem at the same
time i could see i could see some wishy washy stuff because i think god was mad at moses for
throwing the tablets but maybe he was just mad that he broke the tablets like dude i already wrote
him once screw the guys that got killed down there that were worshiping bell but you know uh
you know how sore this finger gets dude this i can only do this once man i can't believe you
made me do it reminds me of that joseph smith thing you know like uh when the woman burns the papers
which i'm doing a series on right now oh man the wife of the man burns the 116 pages that they wrote
of the first Nephi or whatever and she's like well if he's really from god he should be able to write
it again and just was like i can't believe you did that i can't because the enemy has already got a
hold of it and made up some bs story you know why you can't write it again so right anyway i just
rabbit showed it out of there but so so philip you know it was just to recap philip hung by his
ankles by by irons you know through his Achilles tendon upside down by uh from a tree outside of
this serpent temple he caused a hole to open up uh 7 000 men plus women and the priest and the whole
temple fell into the hole and closed it back up uh he dies goes to heaven and gets tortured for 40
days and then is allowed through the gates uh into paradise which when it's eternity 40 days is nothing
right right and then in uh the the other uh sources that we have uh it's clinton of alexandria
who's quoting heraclean and eusebius who's quoting polycretes of emphasis and they both say that philip
died naturally um wasn't martyred anything like that um but the tradition is that he was crucified
upside down uh but they do not like to go into detail uh this is one of my favorite ones to bring up
uh i say well do you know how the apostle philip was martyred and they say well
most of them don't know but every once in a while you'll get one else somebody will say
yeah he was he was crucified he was crucified upside down like um like like peter was
and say well what what else well what do you mean well what about the hole that swallowed the
temple and seven thousand men plus women and children and they just look at you like they
don't know if you're joking they don't know if this is a joke or if you're serious like they're
kind of they kind of half want to uh institutionalize you and half want to be very afraid for their faith
yeah that's what usually happens when you start bringing up stuff like this and of course
what you're going to be saying about paul which is like goodness gracious so i'll go through the next
one's really quick um bartholomew uh traditionally he was uh skinned alive he was played alive
that was the one i was talking about by the way yeah okay right um other other traditions uh so
that the the earliest one the earliest mention of that for the tradition is the the acts of philip
and it's from like the fourth century to fifth century um and he wasn't just flayed he wasn't
just skinned alive he was also crucified and in in some accounts he is just crucified in some
accounts he is flayed alive and then crucified and then beheaded um in some he is uh he is drowned
he's he's uh he's put in a bag the bag's tied up filled with stones and they throw it in the water
and then they drown him uh what yeah um the in the martyrdom of bartholomew it's a fifth
mid-fifth early sixth century text uh it says that he was beheaded in india by king uh um
uh by king astrages astrages um it's it's written in a in a pseudo uh um hippolytus uh text it's
like third century um but just just totally different different stuff um yeah so that's all
over the place uh thomas uh you know thomas is uh uh is called a didymus in uh in john 212
he's called did and he's he's called didymus uh because the also he's called didymus there in
in john and in the acts of thomas um it's an early to mid-third century text he says that thomas
called him didymus uh thomas the twin but the twin of who uh you know who he's supposed to be the
twin of jesus right yeah yeah and that's where it comes from is the acts of thomas oh yeah and
that early to mid-third century apocryphal text okay what did john mean then what's that john
mentions this right right the gospel of john that's well i mean people argue about it uh
probably about jesus uh that's that's kind of what the you know just because it's it's such a
a late a late development i mean there's there's a lot of a lot of being spilled over who or whose
twin uh thomas is but traditionally thomas is killed with spears uh in india uh he's run through
with spears um that's that's in the in the acts of thomas um so the earliest uh the earliest
source for the church tradition of how he was martyred is from the is from like 250 260 ish
and the the earliest mention is from the late second century from clement of alexandria
he which is quoting hara clion uh says that he died a natural death
and this is one uh the acts of thomas is one of the texts that eusebius pops up and says that's
that's not right uh that that's that's heresy that's that's those are lies and and exaggerations
so it seems like eusebius sides with these other guys who talk about natural death more
often than the other ones but he still has his picks where he's like no i agree with this one
and this one this one but i don't agree with that one but but it seems strange though you know that
that the ones that have a a church tradition but the earlier ones especially clement of alexandria
when they're quoting hara clion uh some one of the the earliest uh early church fathers
references to the martyrdom of the apostles says that he died a natural
death you know that it's earlier it's almost like like the the martyrdom of the apostles was
something important to the uh you know third second third century christian community uh
more likely the the third late third uh century christian community and so clement of alexandria
is saying that they died a natural death just wasn't cutting it they had to come up with something
and if you're gonna come up with a lie i mean let's make it a good one right like i didn't
catch a fish this big like it was it was a pretty big fish yeah yeah yeah if you had a little man
in it who was there for three days his name was jonah right oh my gosh um so you got mathew mathew
real famous he's called levi also the also the son of altheas he's called the son of altheas and
mark and uh just levi and lou he's a tax collector he was whenever we're looking at the sources of
the martyrdom uh he was confused for for mathias uh they so they they would uh often conflate the two
mathew and and mathias as if they were they were one and the same um let's see the tradition of
mathew is that he was martyred in ethiopia that he was stabbed in the back by a sword um and
that's from the sixth seventh century um it's a a a pseudopigraphal text um supposed to supposedly
it's allegedly written by um uh by adias uh in the sixth seventh century it's uh but it's it it it
wasn't um and then you have the the only other uh sources that we have for his martyrdom is that
he was uh burned in present day uh eastern uh crimea um in what they called marmadonia or you
might see it called mirna um and he was burned to death by in uh and this city was supposedly
according to tradition was a a cannibalistic city a cannibalistic uh society uh and he was burned to
death it sounds like it doesn't sound it doesn't sound like he was burned to death it sounds like
like they put the fire out at one point and had some dinner oh they were having the lord's
disciple supper it's pretty much what they were doing right they were eating his flesh and drinking
his blood in a whole different oh man wow oh uh her heroclion is heroclion uh whenever heroclion
is mentioning the uh the apostles martyrdom and uh you have um you have uh you have earlier your
church oh shit um dammit what was i saying oh heroclion um all right okay so so heroclion
differentiates between levi and matthew um heroclion is uh is quoted by later church fathers uh
is quoted by clement of alexandria that's where we get a lot of the these martyr these earlier
martyrdom traditions especially of like the natural deaths um so clement of alexandria
quotes heroclion a lot so clement of alexandria notices that instead of identifying levi as
matthew um they use them as as two separate people so they both have the same uh the same tradition
of of martyrdom according to uh to heroclion which is a late second century let's see okay uh
james son of alpheus we're almost there uh there's a a third century sudo hippolytes text um
the same one that i've mentioned earlier and some of the other ones uh because a lot of these texts
mentioned the martyrdom or or the death of all of the apostles or some of them uh and the tradition
and that that tradition is that he was stoned in in jerusalem um and this is like where the the
differences and the the the identification problems come up with is is uh was james the one who was
stoned by the Pharisees mentioned by josephus or or is he not uh because i mean if you if you look at
like the like Protestant churches or like eastern orthodox churches uh in their tradition they don't
accept uh the identification of james as the brother of jesus or at least the best majority of them
don't so this is by and large for the majority a catholic thing that identifies uh james son
of alpheus with the uh the brother of jesus um let's see he's uh mentioned in mark as the son of
mary and uh clopus uh that's doesn't really touch too many nerves um let's see he has another he has
a fifth century uh source or a fifth century mention of him uh is martyrdom uh it's a
hero hero nemean uh martyrology uh it's a fifth century text it says that he was crucified in
persia uh so so far we have a third century a fifth century there's a ninth century text from
nicetus david or nicetus david uh it says that he was martyred in egypt uh doesn't say how
and if he is indeed the brother of jesus then he was stoned uh by by the Pharisees in Jerusalem
so you've got hippolytes in the third and uh josephus and uh josephus saying that he was stoned
by Pharisees in Jerusalem then you've got uh a fifth century uh text saying that he was crucified
in persia so crucified in stone two totally different things persia two totally different places
a ninth century text saying that he was just martyred in egypt uh so it's uh nobody can figure
out what the heck's going on right let's make sure he was killed everywhere just to make sure
he was killed we just want to make sure they know he was killed right put him everywhere though
and then if he is indeed the one that that is identified with uh with that did you that josephus
is mentioning there's a whole other slew of of sources of saying well he wasn't just stoned um
he was he was very or he was he had a heavy stone placed on his stomach and people stood on it
and crushed him and then they picked him up and made him dig a hole and he got in at waist deep
and they filled it up and they stoned him uh saw me it's just it's and then or they they threw him
from from a pinnacle uh the hole and then they stoned him and then they hit him with a club
there's just a whole lot of variances there uh then you've got jude uh it's called thaddeus or
judas son of james in in luke um you've got the the fifth century um uh heroine damean martyrology
that says that he was martyred in suinar persia uh it doesn't say doesn't say how
then you've got a fifth century text the greek acts of jude um that says that he
died a natural death in syria uh then you've got the same pseudohyplitis text that we mentioned
earlier from the third century that says that he died a natural death in asia minor so martyred
in persia natural death in syria natural death in asia minor and the tradition says that he was
clubbed to death flip a coin guys it's probably none of them i mean you think you need to roll
a dice at this point we got more than two choices that's a good idea yeah no great point great point
pick a card pick a card how about that wow um simon the zealot a lot of people don't even know
he was an apostle they're like simon the zealot i don't remember that one it's like you know
harry low lou and was it mo larry curly and yeah and Todd everybody's like well Todd who was Todd
um he's often confused for simon peter son son of Jonah uh some uh mark calls him uh simon the the
kananian or uh kananayan uh let's see we have a couple of different sources um we have the
heroine to me in martyrology from the fifth century that says that he was martyred in
persia just the same as as jude uh you've got the uh what a a text that is supposedly by dorthias
part of dorthias this is a synopsis but it's actually a super beautiful text that's a sixth
century that says that uh that simon the zealot was crucified slain and buried in britain okay so
so far we got martyred in persia and crucified slain and buried in britain and they're less than
100 years apart um and within the same 100 years uh all three texts within 100 years uh authorship
you've got uh uh mo shea of chlorine uh his uh history of armenia it's a late fifth century text
he says as to simon who was sent into persia i cannot relate with certainty what he did nor
where he suffered martyred him it is said that one simon an apostle was martyred at uh various
various spore uh so mo at least mo shea of chlorine is is being honest here um so we got
martyred at uh various spore martyred at persia or crucified and buried in britain
wow this is fascinating and even if they wanted to know they couldn't know by now
there's just too much it's already muddied water that no one can know so the sad part
about this is jim and we haven't even gotten to the juicy is that if we really wanted to know
we can't not with certainty at all there's no way people have fabricated so much that
that it just it messes it up i mean you can you can see why uh why shon mcdowell
can only claim you know like a maximum of three and that's pushing it you know pushing it some
people push forward but i mean okay this next one's gonna be really quick ready judas is scarier
next was was not martyred uh actually so far none none of these guys um have been have been martyred
none of these guys were killed for being a christian uh you got uh matthias uh matthias
replaced uh judas as the 12th apostle uh in x 126 uh they cast lots between uh uh uh joseph or uh um
barcadas or justice uh depending on what what translation you're looking at um and matthias
and the lot fell on matthias so he won um and we don't know a whole lot about him we know we have
a third century sudo hippolitis texts um called uh on the 12 apostles of christ that says that he
died of natural causes in jerusalem and uh it's it's one of our only sources like our only good
source and according to tradition all we know is that he preached in the land of the cannibals
uh so it could be a confusion with with matthew um or he he might have you know there might be
just been a lot of cannibals around sounds like um and then way later you've got a 14th century
historian um um that says that he was crucified in in in colchise uh which is like the country george
in the country georgia like modern-day georgia um and then around 300 years later in the 17th
century you've got a a historian named louis de attiguement who says that he was uh stoned
and then beheaded in jerusalem um and but oddly enough if you want the truth i went to the catholic
encyclopedia and got the truth it says quote all information concerning matthias's life and death
is vague and contradictory there you go there you go we got it dang okay okay you ready buddy
oh my gosh yes all right drum roll the apostle paul tradition according to tradition he was
beheaded in rome in 67 c e it's really really particular on that date some say 67 69 it's
it's usually right right around in there uh so the acts of paul is a late second century text it is
the earliest text that actually says how he died and i'm going to read you an excerpt from it from
the acts of paul's in english translation says then paul stood with his face to the east and lifted
his hands into heaven and prayed a long time and in his prayer he conversed in the hebrew
tongue with the fathers and then he stretched forth his neck without speaking and when the
executioner struck off his head milk milk m i l k spurred it upon the cloak of the soldier
and the soldier and all that were present when they saw it marveled and glorified god which had
given such glory unto paul and they went and told caesar what was done milk yep it's the second second
century um wow and then the that's actually not the full tradition though is the full tradition
actually didn't finish developing until uh until the fifth or sixth century uh so as a legend develops
by the sixth century you had this new tradition where not only did milk come out of his neck instead
of blood but at the moment that paul was decapitated his head rolled and bounced three times on the
ground one two three and water springs freshwater springs sprung up wherever it bounced so three
of them in in a row and uh the the first textual evidence we have this is uh um in a document by
pope gregory the great in the late sixth century uh but you have the the the building of this church
was like in the in the fifth century and there was already a pre-existing tradition of this this
this bouncing head so we know it's a it's a probably a a fifth century development
but there are three springs there in a row you can go to the church you can see that they're
covered they have they have plates covering them but you can put your ear to it you can hear the
water i've seen them i touched them it is they are real springs and this church uh well actually
it's a whole a whole monastery it's like three or four separate churches that were built over hundreds
of years but the the first main one uh i think the the main one was the uh uh the san paulo uh
san paulo alea three voltan uh or the the saint paul the three fountains um yeah that was built in
the fifth century so okay they literally have mythologized this stuff so much they've literally
made natural resources like springs into stories of how those springs even sprung up by using apostles
it's it's just fascinating how quickly something like this is fabricated and he had milk come out
i mean it's like yeah no blood it's just milk doesn't even say blood with milk like the gospels
at least say blood and water when the spear went through jesus side it's just milk like paul's milky
neck man it sounds like a like a punk rock band dude this is crazy so before i get a whole bunch of
christians climbing all over me i do want to mention that there is an earlier text first
clement um writes about it in first clement uh five four through six um but doesn't say anything
about his martyrdom all it says is that he departed from the world and went into the holy
place having been found a notable pattern of patience and endurance that is all that it says
so it it does imply that he died and went to the happy ever after but no mention of martyrdom no
mention of i mean so it talked about his oppression before you know paul talks about he's been stoned
he's been shipwrecked he's preached here preached there been imprisoned yada yada uh first clement
is patting him on the back and they say they say all that but no no martyrdom doesn't say
doesn't even say that that it was in in rome doesn't say he was beheaded
none of that um and then of course you got steven and barnabas but they aren't apostles so we don't
have to talk about them well this seems like a fitting time to close on this subject it's a
man i apologize no no no no no but this is it's interesting to just show how how reliable can
you really be to sit here and say well we know this we know that oh yeah no why would people
die for something they don't believe in well people create stories about stuff like this as well so
to say what is and what isn't it's all written in these books you you it's apologetic in nature
to try and make those cases so i love what you did though you point out a lot of interesting things
mostly contradictory um and i think most christians will agree that most of this stuff's contradictory
a lot of the people who are protestant will go well this is why we disagree with church
tradition but they don't realize how much they use or borrow from the church they might disregard
these stories right here um but there's still so much that's still handed down in in the way they
believe i mean most of these churches still have to believe in a literal physical this or
the physical resurrection or jesus had to have literally physically rose from the dead when paul
has a spiritual kind of resurrection idea like you know i mean it's all orthodoxy still to some
degree well and i just want to say that i was that in in doing this like i was i would say that i
was charitable in in my in my my representation of the the actual uh the actual textual evidence
actual textual tradition of it uh but but i i encourage anybody who's who's watching this and
they they don't like what they see or they they they they don't like my my characterization of
a certain apostles martyrdom then then i i challenge you to see you to go and find a better source
that will fit your narrative and i can promise you you will not find it but you are welcome to try
i love it there's a challenge ladies and gentlemen jim majors go down in the description
join his youtube channel make sure you hit him up on twitter uh unless you're trying to harass him

dr josh will bow in here soon which is gonna be really delightful talking about fellow prophecy
from jeremiah to daniel oh man that's gonna be fun because you know me and prophecy dude oh i'm stoked
about it and i talked to talk to dr josh about it already and we're we're both just thrilled to
