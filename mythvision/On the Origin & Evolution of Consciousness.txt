3G image, not just of the world, but of the temporal state of the world. We can talk now about
think or remember the past, live the present, and anticipate the future. These three together
will give you a 3G image of a model of anything you can think about.
It's a very, very huge step towards consciousness,
which is going to lead us in a very interesting little lovely bird called the western scrub j
in the picture attached here. This interesting bird would actually hide its food in a cache
once it's got an abundance of it for later on. It will actually resist overeating to store it and
being able to eat in the future. It knows the future. What is even more interesting about this
little interesting bird is if it detects a competitor, not a bird, watching it hiding its food,
it will keep hiding in that particular place and waits until the bird flies away and the bird
thinks, okay, I'm going to go and grab that food from that place. He will actually go and hide it
somewhere else after the other bird is actually not just anticipating the future. He's actually
reading the minds of other birds, knowing that they also wonder food and putting themselves in
their position. Once you do that, you're adding another layer to consciousness, which is the
ability to understand that there are other consciousness around you, that they want to
compete for food. They have other desires like yourself and you can outsmart them or you can
empathize with them because they might be a friend or part of your clan. So it might be, okay, well,
here's some food. So being able to understand what other consciousness might be thinking. Go to the
next one. Okay, so that was it. The morality will sort of connect with it, but that is my
presentation of the steps, the small steps that will take to the
to get to the convoluted human consciousness. Look, I mean, I'm not going to lie. It hasn't
been that long. Do you want to get through the morality since you've already tracked us this
far? I mean, sure, we do a vote here right now. There's 154 people. So in the chat, let's get a
one if you want to go into morality and have him explain that with consciousness and evolution,
or if you want to go ahead and stop here for a second video at some point in the future,
where we go into morality and we take Q&A now. So it didn't take him too long. I don't think it'll
be too long to get through the second part, maybe 15 minutes. Yeah, this one is a little
more complex, and it's way more interesting because it's, yeah, but probably about 20, 25 minutes.
So we're still going to be done within the first hour and we still have questions.
Everybody's voting, dude, and it's looking pretty good. I got to hit that like button,
but also let me know. Press one. If you want to hear about his take here, particularly on the
morality point, we got a one here. We got a one here. Yes, a one, one, one, a one. Good to see
you in here. Non-believer dynamic constellation. Again, that's super chat. You are a boss. Terry
Minderbinder. Why not? One, one, one, one, one. We got a lot of ones in here. So it looks like
everybody is interested in hearing what you have to say on the consciousness side. And so are you
cool with continuing? Yeah, absolutely. Because I think it will, it will quite, you know, it's a
nice segue and I will, I will try to again prove that the search for energy has led to the emergence
of morality. So again, morality. I'm going to mute. I'm going to pop up. We're going to continue on
the emergence of morality. And then before we go to the PowerPoint, I mean, we can just exit the
PowerPoint. So I want to define some terms because again, once before we get into the subject, I like
to ensure what people agree. We agree on what morality is. Yes, morality can be explained in
so many different ways. To me, morality is nothing but a tool, a human tool that has been developed
over the years to, to better serve humanity in terms of conservation and social contracts with
other fellow Homo sapiens to ensure that the survival of the group. It's, it has not come from
heavens. It's been, it's been with us from day one. It's the rules of engagement. It's, I'm not
going to hurt your kids. You don't hurt mine. Simple as that. You don't need any superpower
to explain to you that without morality, humanity would have not survived. As a matter of
fact, animals do that. That's why infanticide, you know, apart from few species is not widely
practiced. And killing their own species is not widely practiced. It's done within the animal
kingdom. So you don't need to even be human to realize that there are certain rules of engagement.
As a matter of fact, you would see some interesting footages of deers, hippos, crocodiles and lions
when they are very thirsty in Africa. They can be all lined up around the lake
drinking. And it's peacetime because we're not interested in food at this point. We're just
drinking. It's almost like that social contract of we're drinking now or we're not, we're not eating
so you can actually, 20 minutes, but let me get my drink. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds about right.
Yeah. So we do. Just to say, yeah, I think that, yeah, I think the construct has developed.
And you could say that we have really sharpened our skills on trying to create better.
Even if it goes contra nature in some sense, we have created models that try to tone down
nature. If that makes sense on how we have these models socially speaking, because it's not about
just the individual's pleasure, there's a bigger picture. Yeah. We're already gone beyond, there's
no such thing as Darwinian socialism. I mean, it's always talks about it and he said, look,
we were gone beyond that. We don't need that anymore. We can understand the beginnings and the
underpinning urges, but we can now, because we've got that consciousness, we can now
write better social contracts amongst ourselves. Jean-Jacques Rousseau would have argued.
So we can do that way better now. Again, you don't need God for anything supernatural.
There is a negotiation amongst ourselves. And that's why you get different moralities around
the world. What we see moral here, I mean, all of animals, and dogs is probably one of my favorite
animals. A lot of people love dogs, but you go to China and you see them sold in the market for
meat and you go, yeah, and you go so enraged. But then if you're a civilization that will think
pigs are so smart and never be slaughtered, should never be slaughtered. And then you're here eating
a BLT. Then who are we to talk about our own morality and morality isn't to our tastes over
there sort of thing. It's quite like cows are treated as sacred and holy in India at certain
places. Whereas, yeah, so it just depends on the compass of the social cultural context and then
go from there. This is good. Are we going to do it now?
Yeah, so I'm just going to some morality. Now we agree what morality is. And yeah,
and let's let's display. I want to take one moment to ask everybody who's watching. I've pinned
Hanny's YouTube channel in the comment section at the top. Please, please, please, for the sake of
what we do here and of course, show and love and community. We're setting the higher moral
standard on YouTube amongst some of the bigger YouTube channels. Go subscribe to our guests,
subscribe to Hanny, take the moment right now, click that YouTube channel, hit that button,
come on right back and join us live. We're not going anywhere. And I'll get started. Give me
15, 20 seconds. That's enough time to go click, maybe open up a separate window, subscribe, help
out our friend here, Hanny. All right, Hanny, I'm going to mute and then I'm going to go ahead and
pop this up and get it ready.
So I'm not seeing the presentation, Derek, is it supposed to be there?
I can't see it. Oh, wow, I hit it share. Hold on. Oh, really? Oh, now I can see it.
I didn't have it shared up on the screen. Here we go.
Morality. Okay, we can straight away. So again, I'm going to be arguing that the rise of morality
have emerged from or stems from the search for food or energy. Go to the next slide, please.
Okay, so we'll define morality, but we can also define it in simpler form for the sake of this
mental exercise. I'm going to define morality as incurring costs to yourself, whether it's energy,
time, money, whatever, in order to benefit someone else. And the range of that can be
as little as being on an airplane and helping a little old lady to lift her baggage in the
storage area, all the way to jumping in a lake to save someone's life. These were called moral acts.
But it's quite interesting. It's quite interesting. Why do we have that urge? Why natural selection
would have, especially those who read the Selfish Gene by Dawkins and misunderstood it,
they'll actually think it's actually altruism is actually inbuilt. If you understand properly,
it's the selfishness at the gene level, but there is the kin selection and
other type of selections that will actually deem that you could sacrifice yourself in order for
the group to survive or your genes. But why is that urge? Why do we feel good about helping other
people? Why do we care about things that will not win us any brownie points like recycling,
plastic, and nobody's looking? Why do we do that? I guess I've defined already what's in
that slide. Can we move to the next one, please? Okay, we're going to go back to about 500 or 350
million years. And this is a world controlled and governed by reptiles. The brain is made of three
different parts. The very ancient, we call it the ancient brain is the bad part. And that's the part
that controls instincts, sexual desires, food urges, everything that's primal. And we get the
middle brain. And that's your family tides, your emotions, your group dynamics. And then the
prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex is only two million years old. And that covers the
logical abilities and so forth. This is still growing. Humans by far display the biggest
frontal lobe cortex in all mammals. However, when we go back to 350 million years ago, we're talking
about reptilian brains and reptilian nervous systems. If you notice a turtle, a sea turtle,
laying eggs on a beach, and there are hundreds of them. And the mother will sort of move away
and go away. Doesn't have any more business. And that sea turtle will have to fend for itself,
because it's got like 10 to 15 seconds to swim to the water before iguanas and hoax and other
predators will grab them and eat them alive. So these animals will have to learn so quickly
within the first 15 to 20 seconds of their life. And we'll probably within the first few
minutes of their life, we'll learn every skill they will need forever, in terms of hiding,
running, doing everything. You want to say Derek something? No, I just think it's interesting to
think about. Yeah. And the mother, so the mother would leave the animal and you will see that in
an other animal in the animal kingdom, if the babies mature a lot quicker, they don't need the
care of the mother. The mother doesn't care because again, there are lots of them as well.
Instead of if you're a mammal, usually you have a litter, maybe the maximum is like eight or 10.
But if you're a reptile, we're talking hundreds, because you know, probably half of that, if not
more will be eaten. So the rest will make it and we'll learn very, very, very quickly.
The nervous system and the brain of these reptiles are only pretty much focused around
the welfare of themselves. It sustains them only. They don't need to care for their offspring,
because their offspring will learn very, very quickly. So they have a very primitive nervous
system that will only look after that particular animal. If that animal does not have the right
nervous system to look after itself, it's extinct. It's gone. That is an initial condition needed for
the conservation of that particular animal. These animals, they're called ectotherms.
Reptiles are ectotherms, which means they regulate their body temperature
through the external heat. That's why you see lizards and, you know, they're sunbathing, they're
trying to observe the heat. And they can only, they mostly eat around the daytime. At night,
they'll hide, they'll hibernate, they go away to conserve heat that they've observed throughout the
day. So, and that's why they don't need to eat, they don't need to eat as often.
Crocodile might need to eat once a month, and that'll be enough to sustain them.
Now, go back to about 300, 200 million years ago. 200 million years ago,
something's happened. That was the emergence of mammalian life. Some sea creatures have crawled
out of the ocean and found that there is abundance of food out there. And that was the rise of the
first homeotherms, the warm-blooded animals. We also know as mammals, because we're warm-blooded
animals. For the first time, you can have an open buffet the entire day. You don't need,
because what's a homeotherm means, self-regulating, self, the heat comes from the calories you burn.
So, you can eat day and night.
Very, very good. However, it poses a challenge. For a homeotherm to survive, it needs 10 times the
amount of food to eat more than an ectotherm. So, that's right there, an ecological pressure. It
needs to find food, it needs to search for food all the time, and it will need to be smarter for
that to happen. So, the way nature would react to that is either by making the animals a bit
smarter, so a lot more neurological synapses and connections in the brain, make the brain bigger,
but that's quite costly and trade-offs and evolution is quite important. It doesn't happen
that immediate. Or have it that the animal mature at a later stage and get smarter, get a nervous
system that is designed to learn slower, but learn a lot more over time.
So, that's why we see the mammals. And mammals is sort of breasted animals and it will actually
care for their offspring and breastfeed them. And the litter is smaller and there is that care
factor. For the first time, the nervous system of an animal is not just designed for the mother
or the parents, but it's for me and mine. So, myself as an animal and my offspring.
And that's why you get that mammalian connection. It's a smaller litter and you get that connection.
And with that, it was the emergence of the serotonin.
Sorry, the oxytocin, I'm not saying. That is the love hormone. That is the opioid that gets
produced by the brain to emphasize bonds between mother and offspring and offspring and mom and
mother. A baby monkey might need the care of its parents for quite some time. But once it's
grown up, the learning curve is quite steep. It's quite big. You can learn way more skills.
But it needs that first connection between mother and offspring. So, this is the first
time the central nervous system is designed, not just to look after yourself, but to look
after someone else. And that's the precursor of morality. That someone else is other than you.
So, you caring and you're doing something nice for your offspring, but that was not the case
before in the reptilian life. So, that's the very first step towards morality. You're doing nice stuff
for other animals other than yourself.
So, if you apply that to modern humans, Homo sapiens is about the oldest specimen we found in
Morocco 300,000 years ago. Religions is about only 10,000 years ago. This is the agriculture age.
This is where you get all the feminine gods. And you have the hunters and gatherers,
sort of dynamics. And the communities are getting bigger. And you need to have a law to govern this
particular area. And they end up with the first class of priests, the shaman. Those who tell you
that there is an invisible entity out there that will probably harm you or punish you or reward you
if you do certain things. So, we know for a fact that religion isn't the source of morality,
because religion is only, and we're talking about the non-Ibrahamic religions here,
some 10,000 years ago. However, humanity is way older than that. So, we must have had some sort
of code of conduct before religions has sort of broken into the scene, because morality is way
before that. So, if people face who would claim that morality is a marriage with religion,
then it's not true. It's objectively not true, because it must have pre-existed
the emergence of religions. So, we can go to the next slide, please.
So, this is where I'm talking about the social behavior of emergence and evolutionary response
to the issue about food, which is basically, it leads to the emergence of mammals. You can
eat day and night, but you have to eat 10 times more. So, you've got to delay the maturity of the
animal organisms and you end up with the care factor between mother and offspring.
And the ecological pressure being put on the mammals for them to find food. So,
that pressure has been answered in terms of evolution, in terms of making the animals mature
slower, but make the learning curve very, very steep and very, very large. And for that requires
the bond between mother and offspring and that's the precursor of morality, doing something nice
for someone else other than yourself. Go to the next slide, please.
So, we talked about this before. These are the maturity, the learning curve between a baby
turtle and a baby rat. A rat is a mammal and will learn way more and will need its mother care for
quite some time. That's not the case with the baby turtle being in the reptilian family.
So, there are some trade-offs. In evolution, there's always a trade-off. You get a higher learning
capacity, but you get higher newborn dependence on the mother. And that is the care factor. So,
now the rewiring moves from me to me and mine. Okay, next one, please.
So, this is the opioids that get introduced in the brain. We talked about the oxytocin. So,
you emphasize the pain and pleasure systems. That's why when I said, why do we feel good helping
other people? Because of oxytocin. You get a very good dosage of oxytocin in few. Once you,
once, you know, that guy sitting on a corner and asking for food and you've got a, you've got a
couple of pieces of, a couple of sandwiches and you decide to give him a sandwich and you look
over your shoulder and you see the person smiling at you and you have a brilliant day. You feel
good. You go to work. You feel refreshed. You feel you've done something nice. And that's because
you've got a very handsome repayment of oxytocin in your brain. And we get that, obviously,
started from mother and offspring. But as society gets complex, because a lot of animals
display the offspring mother and offspring bond, but other animals will have that
areas. And we're going to talk about it in a second in, in the tribe or in the group.
And that group gets bigger and bigger and bigger. You might include your own race.
If there are such a thing, there's no such thing as race and science, but it's only one race,
which is the human one, human species. So, but when you do something to even cross species,
now, humanities are caring for other animals and you feel very good about looking after your dog
and your dog looks after you. Now, this is, this is a telling fact here. Oxytocin are,
they sit on receptors on the brain and they get expressed. And they wanted to know what,
what causes the monogamy, for example, why some, some animals are monogamous. So,
TT monkeys and the California deer mice are monogamous. And they turned out that their,
their brain receptors, the, the oxytocin gets expressed in areas that emphasizes monogamous
relationships. However, if you go to, for example, to the baboons and baboons are more like a family
or tribal type of animals, the same receptors, the oxytocin are expressed at the group dynamic level.
So, they feel the same handsome dosage of oxytocin mu released when they go beyond
their kin, they just, within the group of their, of their clan.
So, we know for a fact now that humans tend to have a very high reward systems around areas of
cooperation. There are so many different experiments and tests that will show that in, in even little
children. They feel a lot more when there's a bit of a cooperation system going on. They,
they feel happy. And you can actually see the, the influx of, of, of the oxytocin.
Being emphasized by that social inclusions. While the opposite social exclusion or rejection
by the clan or by the mother will lead to the decrease of oxytocin, which means an increased
distress. So that's the pleasure and pain system completely in operation, making sure that more of
what we think is a moral, just act that's suspended. And it's in the abstract. It's actually
emphasized by the chemistry of your brain, which means it's hard wire into you from very early
stage, because that particular behavior would mean that you group would survive and thrive
better when you produce these particular attitudes over and over and over again, like
cooperation. Next slide, please.
Yeah, I think that, that was it.
That was it. Yep.
Yeah. So again, the search for energy in both occasions have led to the emerged, obviously
moral, moralities now has taken different, because now we can talk about it in different
terms and morality is a lot more complex, but these are the humble begins because everything
we talk about in evolution, it's not convoluted. It's very, very simple. It's very, so the very
simple beginning of morality here is for the first time in a nervous system is geared up to
look after another living being other than yourself. That's the beginning of morality.
There's so much here to get into and actually research and dive deeper because you literally
did like an airplane drive by just giving us an idea. What I found interesting even at the
introduction was just a gradient from non-life to life is how any abiogenesis scientist other
than the one who's a creationist guy who, but he's even not an abiogenesis scientist, but he
likes to, you know, because he's a chemist, so he's aware of chemical compounds.
Oh, James Stewart.
But at the end of the day, they're like, it's super gradual and you could see even in the
complexity, let's just assume life already started. I don't care if aliens came down with
wizard wands or if it gradually happened life. We got like very primitive point of life you
described with some of those images and I saw that YouTube video that uses those cartoon images.
I watched that video a long time ago in the evolution of consciousness and it's about food.
The whole thing is about hunting and desiring and hiding food and creating memory to know where
you stored your food or how to make sure I can get more food in the future and kind of
becoming gradually more advanced to try and make sure you could survive more.
And I think that that whole spectrum there plays a significant role in almost every area,
including the morality point. There's just so many things that kind of come to mind and
I read a book called A Short Something of Life on Earth. Someone recommended,
one of my Patreon fans recommended I read it and I read it and I got to interview that scholar
because he goes through from the start of life in the sea level, like on the sea floor pretty
much algae and all that kind of stuff to what we end up having today and then going in from
birds to reptiles to, you know, we're reptiles to birds to all sorts of cool stuff. So I highly
recommend people take this stuff further. Before we get into Q&A and asking super chats,
is there anything you wanted to mention? No, I think it's organically now from the
questions we're probably going to end up talking about bits and pieces. But the last thing I want
to add is I don't want people to think because of the beginnings of these things that they're now
cheap. Like morality is a cheap thing. It's a materialistic thing and it's just a search for
food. So we're just us atheists around making everything that is so valuable to humanity so
cheap. That is not what I'm trying to say at all. Morality is very important. It's taken a completely
different turn. Now we are aware of it. Now we can seek it and we can get better at it. We know
we can include animals. We can include other species around us. We can be better to us and
the planet. And with more information, that's why I don't subscribe to the objective moral truth.
God is a moral agent and he's objective and therefore morality is objective. I think it's
subjective and I think it's changing. And it's a good thing that it's changing because as more
information comes in, you alter your behavior and you do something better next time because you
know better. And I like that. I don't like stagnant. Anything stagnant is just not nice. I like dynamic
change, evolution of things. I think evolution sums up life quite nicely and entropy and cosmology.
You've got two things together. Entropy and evolution will mean that you can never be stagnant.
Any static organism will end up being dead. You've got to be on the move. You got to always
change your mind. You can always revisit what you think it's real and what you think it's true
and never stay static. I think the same of religion. If your religion is not changing,
don't worry. It'll become a fossil. And that's why I think Christianity out the gate was like
the turtle you described earlier. It had to wiggle and run fast. It had to change. It had to
learn everything you needed to learn in 48 hours so that I'm making an analogy to the early church
and continue to evolve and find a way to formulate. And once they set it in stone,
you still had heretics that were still trying to push different views. But even then, there were
debates down into the 7th, 8th century on the Christology of Jesus and then various new things
come up. They find different ways to distract themselves with their religion, dumb down people,
don't read this book, that kind of thing. But the Enlightenment really, really did some stuff to
them. So anyway, let's get into the super chats and here we go. Sorry, you were saying just about
the religions being fossils. We actually can see that right now. There are certain gods that can
only see them in museums or in DC comics. And that's been relegated to that. So if these current
religions don't do something very, very quickly, they'll soon join their brethren. Yep, that's
true. Contextual religion, thank you for the super chat. Just show and love, keep at it. Thank you
so much. I appreciate that. Experiments in prebiotic chemistry. This is the number one reason I am an
atheist. Consciousness is produced by the brain. No soul, no afterlife, no final judgment equals no
God. Well, my answer to that is very simple. We think now consciousness is definitely coming from
the brain. And I'll give a couple of proofs on that, or evidence, I would say, because proof is
only mathematics and you cannot really provide proofs, mostly evidence right now. This split
brain personality. There was a doctor called Chandler and there's a video, a very, very famous
incident where an epilepsy patient, when you have epilepsy, they sever the brain, they
separate the right hemisphere from the left hemisphere. So the electrical pulse sort of
does not continue. And that person was half of his brain was an atheist and the other half
was theist. That's one example. Second example, a person who is heterosexual married got a tumor
over the amygdala. The amygdala is an area in the brain that function as the moral judgment area.
Turn into pedophilia. They operated on the tumor, the pedophilia disappeared.
Then tumor came back again, pedophilia appeared. So I can send you guys references that,
you know, after the show, I'll put it in the comments. Where is the soul in here? If we're
talking about a certain behavior that will continue to death in this life and eternal
tournament at the end of days of something that you are not in control of, where is the spirit
here? Where is the essence? It's weird you just brought this up. I had a psychologist buddy
spent 20 years in the hospital, I mean, working with people on behavioral side.
I believe it's the psychology part, not the psychiatrist where they prescribe the medicine,
but the behavioral. He was pointing out that people with sexual issues when it comes to these
type of things, usually never reform with these kind of behaviors, usually. I imagine with a
normal brain, if you end up having or at least meaning no tumors pressing any area or anything
like this, I would imagine the point is, is they don't usually recover from that. There's no cure.
And you kind of have to ask yourself, I am not in any way defending them. But it's kind of like,
what made that happen? And I imagine ancients would go, he did some sin in his early life or
maybe like, I don't know, he was in his previous life, he did something wrong and now he's paying
for it now or I don't, you know, the crazy idea is to try and come up with what it is. And I'm
looking for what's wrong with the brain. And I, in fact, if you ever watched that Jeffrey Dahmer
show, it was out at the end, they wanted to preserve his brain to maybe see if something was
wrong with it. They said, destroy it. I would have been curious to know, I mean, obviously,
he should have gone extinct and, you know, be dead. But you kind of wonder what would we have
learned if we did discover something about his brain or why he behaved the way he did? I don't know.
Yeah. And that will question the soul right there. I mean, if there is something that is
abstract and it's suspended from you, why does our behavior completely and drastically change,
not just from tumourism, you could have displayed a completely different mood if you
woke up on the wrong side of the bed or didn't have a cup of coffee. This is how your chemicals in
the bridge, the chemicals. And I'm talking about temporary changing moods. Mind you, if you have
just structural damage in your brain, who owns that op? I mean, you didn't design that.
Trust me. I know as a drug addict. And the interesting thing about that, just as we go
further into the next super chat here in a minute, is when I talk to another recovery doctor who knows
the brain and he talked about your frontal lobe cortex is not connecting right to your midbrain.
So it's misfiring and your behavior, which is being controlled by what's in the frontal lobe
cortex on how you should do things in decision making processes, are connecting proper to your
midbrain. And he said, it takes time to heal those neurons on how they're going to fire and how you're
going to properly behave to know how to change that behavior. And I call that rewired addiction,
my program, but it's like rewiring the brain's process of trying to learn how to behave in the
proper way. Sometimes they say you have to act a certain way, even if you don't want to, until
you start wanting to act the way you behave. I know it sounds crazy, but it's like-
Think about it. Do I want to go to the gym and sweat my butt off for two hours when I haven't
been to the gym in a long time? I know it's healthy. I know it's good, but do I really want to do it?
Once you start behaving and making yourself do it, next thing you know, there's a reward process that
comes from it, and that reward isn't immediate. It's a reward that comes from this emergence of
consciousness you're describing, but I learned that my decision making process got hijacked.
The addiction almost felt instinctual, like sex, water, sleep. And if I didn't have it,
I felt like I was going to die. So I was willing to do things morally that were not correct, not
right, not good for society, which is why I ended up getting a crime charge against me.
You do things you wouldn't have done. And now, of course, I want to help others not have to go
there. So that's a little more personal, but I figure I would throw it out there just to let
people understand. When I discovered some of this, this is what helped me de-convert and realize it
ain't demons, it ain't God, it ain't monsters. This is natural. And you can kind of also forgive
yourself a little for being a human, an animal, right? Not, oh, I'm a fallen angel and I should
have been the pinnacle in the image of God and like, I'm nothing and he's everything to, I'm
a rising ape who's trying to learn to live in this world. That's why Derek also our punishment
system of change. It's changed from just being angry with other people and wanting to take revenge
and wanting to get even, you know, burning witches to the stake and not suffering them
all the way to the point where the death penalty is being abolished, understanding that, but you
still have to have punishment because people would say, actually, well, if you're not in control,
why punish people at all? Unfortunately, you are that vehicle that is colliding with everyone and
you have to at least separate it and isolate it from the community so that you won't damage
other people or try to rehabilitate it. So unfortunately, we still have to own even the
accidents we were born with because we are everything, including our brains.
Thank you. Again, Hany, I really appreciate you joining me. Constellation Pegasus in the house,
you two need to get to a kingdom hall soon. Armageddon's right around the corner. What's
you waiting for? Get hot and on it. Thank you so much for the super chat. XJW here being funny,
so really appreciate that kingdom hall is not where it's at. The Seventh Day Adventist is.
Constellation Pegasus, again, is free will and consciousness same illusion as a determinist?
I think the only way to prove free will exist is if these bunch of atoms called humans find a way
to leave the universe and continue to live forever. It's saying these atoms decided to leave on their own.
Well, thank you for such a generous, Constellation Pegasus is just a wonderful, generous person.
This, I'm a compatibilist, but I'm a compatibilist who believes that there is no free will,
but I'm a compatibilist for pragmatic reasons. I just don't want to go mad because
even the most determinists will still, after they finish talking about free will,
and somebody would ask them steak or chicken tonight, and they go, oh, let me think about it,
and still act as if they have free will. So like Christopher Hitchens once said,
do you think we have free wills? And I don't think we have a choice but to have free will.
So I think that's the dilemma. I'm a determinist at heart, but I don't operate life as if I'm
determined. I still make choices and live the illusion, which is, again, according to Daniel
Dennett, all these illusions, the consciousness, free will, morality, everything that we have
constructed, they're very, very helpful. They're not bad illusions. They're making sure that life
is simple for you. Otherwise, you won't be able to go through your day. It makes me wonder,
are we meant to know this? Are we meant to understand this? And you look at humans,
and you see the experiments Michael Schermer talks about in his book, The Believing Brain,
and you go, we're even more superstitious than animals, statistically speaking. So
are we meant to figure this out? And will this screw us up discovering the fact? And what if
the reality, the truth, is a scarier outcome than the let's remain dumb, not try to advance in this
respect and just go off a superstition and live in a fantasy? You know what I mean?
Superstition is not that bad. It's the other side of the other thing that we use quite nicely,
because that's scientific imagination. When Einstein thought about relativity and thought
about the thought experiment, about free falling in an elevator, that comes from the
same area as superstition. It's that imagination. It can go off whack. So other animals don't have
that at all. And therefore, they're just going through that linear path, while us humans diverged,
and we can go both ways. We can go crackpots, or we can go... But I think it's the same side of the
coin. I could talk to you for a long time. I mean, there's just so much to talk about pertaining
to this topic. And in fact, I was talking to my wife about this last night, we kind of have routines
about how we do things, whether it's breakfast, we go to the gym, we get breakfast, get our coffee.
And then at night, sometimes we've got a big bathtub in the house we're renting,
we just sit there and soak and talk. And we talked about evolution last night. So it's really...
And even though I've explained it sometimes, last night, she said,
you did better that last night than you've ever done explaining it. And it makes a lot of sense.
You need to record that. And I said, well, just so you know what I explained, I know I got some
stuff wrong in the process of explaining that. She goes, that doesn't matter, because someone
like me who never understood it, never thought it was true or made sense, you made it make enough
sense that it was like baby steps into the door of like, ah, okay, that actually makes some sense
of what you're describing. And I'm like, because people like you or guts that given might be using
terminology or might be like going, you know, first of all, and it's all good stuff. It's just,
I'm like having a really tiptoe holding their hand explaining her way into this whole idea. So...
Well, I understand said once, I think if you can't explain it to an eight years old, you don't
understand it. So I think some of the things is a good thing. That means you actually have good
grasp of the subject matter. So I'd say enough. I don't feel like it's good. I feel like it's enough
to just at least explain the mechanism, the mechanic of how, why this is what we think now.
Pocket locker 86 in the house. Jay, appreciate the love evolution in the house. God isn't real.
Happy holidays, Derek. We are myth vision. I had to add that. Like I could have just read it like
we are myth vision, but I was like, we are myth vision. Be sure to subscribe to Jay. He came on
here the other day and was talking about evolution. And his YouTube channel is here. If we have anybody
in the chat that might be a mod, please. Actually, while I'm here, might as well copy and paste it.
But yeah, go show the community some love, just like a good primate would. And let's
show us some love. Let's go subscribe to our chat here, especially for the support. Jay,
we've got some work to do. We've got courses that are coming up. And we've got more work to do,
start educating our fellow humans on planet earth here. All right, we're scrolling down.
Undead daemon. Thank you so much for the super sticker.
Did you have a comment? Trooping the color.
Okay. Thank you so much for the support. I didn't see a, just appreciate the sticker.
A contextual religion. Again, Hanny, can you give me a quick rundown of how evolution explains
the move from asexual cells, male and female species, or two, I mean, that that's just two,
I think, male and female species. This is the biggest issue I have with evolution.
Well, in very, very simple terms, and obviously I'm by no mean an expert because I,
my studies are not in biology. But the way I understand it is if everything starts at a
humble beginning and requires less amount of energy to do. However, if it seems to be good enough
for the survival of species, the mechanism itself, the mechanism of evolution themselves,
also evolve. So if this is a mechanism of reproduction and reproduction, remember,
we said two things are required for a living being to be called the living being.
There are actually seven, it's called the Mrs. Grinn, and this is an acronym for the seven
characteristics an organism need to display. But I go with the Schrödinger one, which is the simplest
one, an organism needs to sustain itself. So that's the lipid and the information is kept and reserved
and being able to replicate itself, making copies of itself. The splitting
that's extremely gradual too, like this transition, like everything else is just,
it's just time. I mean, if we had a camera and we could roll it,
I'd love to be a fly on the wall. Because I actually was asked this question,
you could tell I don't know, I'm not aware of evolution on the scale of other science-minded
folks like yourself, or even far more science-minded like Guts at Gibbon, Erica, others, you're very
aware. But when I had Professor Davon, we were talking about it, someone asked like,
if you could go back in time with a camera and like film something happening, and I was like,
hey, biogenesis, and Professor Dave was right. He's like, what do you mean? You're not going to see
anything. You're not going to see anything happen. And his point was, you would need millions of years
of a camera rolling, and you need to speed it up enough that you could see it in five minutes
to see something form and like to become something you just couldn't.
And you probably wouldn't notice it because there is never an evolution at defining moments.
There isn't a moment where an ape gives birth to, it's always the same species. There are
micro little changes, you can even detect them. That's why I had the problem in the last live
stream about evolution saying, how this is a threat to any form of theism, unless you think God is
like, doesn't carry empathy, right? So it's more of a force or a law rather than it being any type
of personal entity at all. Because all the death that it took for all of these previous models
to get to where we are today, so much death. And you got to go like, what we're describing in these
texts doesn't work in that model. It just doesn't. This is my walk away. It's like theistic evolution
for those who still want to walk away and go, I'm still a Bible-believing Christian. And they
want to somehow save the Bible from evolution. Like, what in the world? God steered all of this
in the process through which he steered it all this death and really cannibalism of life itself.
Because when you can't find just, you know, like that book says at the bottom of the sea, there's
there's, they're just eating algae and things like that to turning on its own different species or
bad term, different life forms are eating themselves as energy forms. And now today,
I was explaining to my wife yesterday, I was like, literally certain animals are the absolute life
which other animals have to eat, rip their flesh, bleed to death, destroy in order to survive.
Like it's, it's crazy. It's chaotic in a way. If you look at it from this theistic point of view.
So I've got, there is a comment by Daniel Whitaker, which is I disagree with. He said,
sexual reproduction is a strategy to differentiate DNA, not a strategy of reproduction. I disagree
because DNA, it's to carry hereditary attributes and the final outcome is reproduction, not the
other way around. Because as I said, one of the most important underpinning characteristic of a
living being is to be able to reproduce when the RNA, which is the hypothesis for biogenesis of the
woman that the RNA, which is the one helix along with the lipids and the proteins, a splitting cell
or a splitting bacteria gets attacked by a virus or by another bacteria will actually cease to exist
because it's when it replicates, it replicates identically with the asexual, with the sexual
reproduction. Although it takes energy, it takes way more energy. And that's why you've got lots of
species who can actually do asexual and sexual reproduction and they can alternate based on
conservation of energy. But with asexual reproduction, you get an interesting mix of male
and female DNA that you get more varying genetic pool later on. When you add to that the mutation,
which is the errors in the copying and you get the teas and the season and you get the random
errors. And it gets picked up by natural selection because it's got to use like a quarter of a wing.
Eventually it has a use and it leads to the evolution of a certain species. But I think
the the object of affection here is not the DNA, it's the reproduction. The reproduction is
one of the most important characteristics of a living being is to be able to replicate itself.
A DNA is a thing that will aid reproduction, not the other way around.
Thank you so much contextual religion. I hope that helped.
Experiments in prebiotic chemistry. Hey, Hanning, unless I missed it, you forgot to mention Alzheimer's
disease, Alzheimer's disease. Great response though.
Yeah, unfortunately that's again and hereditary. These things are hereditary. So they run in the
family. So yeah, thank you so much for that super chat. Constellation or contextual religion,
sorry. I'm so used to constellation. Contextual religion. Thank you. Eyes are needed to hunt
food efficiently. But with how complex vision system is, I'm having a hard time seeing how
organisms knew to make this body part without, say, a download or something like that,
not hating. Thank Derek for my skepticism. This might need another episode in its own,
the evolution of the eye. Right. So the evolution of the eye can be a full episode because
different species have different types of eyes. We actually don't have the best of eyes. The
octopods, like the octopus and squids have better eyes on us. They don't have the blind spot we have
where the race is back to front. And I think it's been about, it's about 12 steps that the eyes
have evolved. But we're talking about, when we talk about vision, we're not talking about the
vision we have right now. We're talking about pinhole without a lens that will only recognize
dark from light. That is the beginning of vision. Exactly like that. And then you get
all these types of separate evolutions of eyes. There are some animals that can see infrared
and ultraviolet. We can't. I know this is a, I always use personal examples in my own life to
try and give analogies. But when I was young and dumb and on a beach trying to flex my muscles
and I got in this huge fight, all these college guys, like we're jumping in on our small crowd,
they were even recruiting people. Anyway, I get beat up, man, baseball bat to the back. I mean,
they're pounding on my head. I got jumped, right? I started going unconscious and like I almost
literally went unconscious and then who knows what they would have done to me then. But I didn't,
but my sight started fading big time, but I was seeing tunnel vision. Like I could see the light
at the end of the tunnel type of thing. My vision was starting to give out and that kind of crap.
And I've had that happen not only with those kinds of situations, even drugs like with heroin
when I was addicted. You're almost the point of complete fade and boom, you're seeing your
visions going out, things like that. And I hear a lot of people getting choked out. The last thing
you're seeing is that little bit of bright light at the distance. It's your sight that goes out.
People who are also training for jets in like, they're up there in like, what is it called?
Mach 3, Mach 4, Mach 5, whatever. The pressure is so intense. Their sight starts to go out,
they go unconscious. So the blood is not getting to the head or the oxygen isn't getting to the head.
And yeah, I'm just... Remember, your eyes is the hardware. The eyes is the hardware,
but it's connected to software and that software is in your brain. So anything that
will affect your vision. And that's why it's the hardware working with the software. So the more
complex the eye vision is, it needs to have the proper software to operate it as well,
which is the link with the neurological link between the eyes and the brain.
Contextual religion, thank you for your skepticism and your support. I really appreciate that.
Bigly agnostic in the house, appreciate that support being a member and the super chat.
I almost slapped my forehead when you pointed out consciousness started millions of years
before religion. So spiritually based morality is a fallacy.
Well, there is no... I don't think there's morality in religion because for a moral
agent, to be a moral agent, it needs to be something that was realized from
within that particular conversation for the species. The morality provided in religion is
called in philosophy the divine command theory. It's provided to you. It's almost like freedom.
Freedom cannot be given. If I say, I'm going to give you freedom that actually negates freedom
on the concept of freedom. It's a self right that is not given. Once it's given, it's incoherent.
And so is morality. Morality is the conduct of people amongst themselves. If it's given from
above, because remember that God is quite arbitrary. Certain things that were deemed immoral because
God said, don't do them. Then if God says, oh, but by the way, you're allowed to do them now
because I said so. And then there's only moral. Just like that slavery was so bad because the
Jews were in Egypt. They were never in Egypt, by the way. I'm Egyptian and I can tell you
firsthand testimony that they were never there. The archaeologists, they were not there.
But God was very upset. The Jews were in state by Egyptians. And as soon as they were out,
he just told them all the malachite is fair game. Go ahead and keep the versions for yourself.
What happened to morality then? So we're talking about arbitrary morality based on God's whim.
That is not morality. That's called the vitamin theory. It's by order.
Wow. You brought it to religion and actually this full circles the whole thing vaguely. I love
this question or this point because I always thought, you know, these arguments from Christians
for a while, when you don't really factor in evolution, when I didn't know about evolution,
I thought, man, this is a heck of an argument. Like, dude, they got a great point. Christians
are right. And then when you learn and you read and you keep reading and you keep learning and
you kind of find out a thing or two. So I want a full circle bringing this to religion because,
you know, Myth Vision talks about mythology, ancient religion and the development. And I
definitely factor in evolution now into what we see even in the Bible. And we talk about, you talk
about, you know, subjective morality rather than being objective. At one point, you see humans
sacrificing humans, even biblically speaking, God commands, you know, your firstborn son.
Eventually it becomes trade off for something else, which is the best move you can do for
survival of a group. But what's interesting is it brings me to that Michael Shermer part in his
book, Believing Brain, that we both have read, where they have replica beaks of birds that see
the red at the tip. And if you make a fake red that's even more red, it won't even go to the
one that's the real thing. It'll go to the fake thing. So there's a sense in which it's like,
if I can get opiate rush from showing kindness to my sister or my brother or whatever, that's cool.
But if I can get an opiate rush by eating this plant, like, I will go to the plant probably
before I go out of my way to try and do some effort to please my brother so that I get opiate
effect. And I'm talking about the poppy plant. Let's just use that as an example.
So these things get hijacked in these systems that evolve and that we develop, and we call them
religion in many ways. And isn't it interesting, you talk about food as the primary energy source,
I find it interesting, you also brought up a lot about sex. So sex and food come up a lot,
replicate, get an energy, replicate, keep getting energy. Isn't it interesting that these religions
specifically the Abrahamic ones, and I'm going to go so far as to just start pointing closer
towards Second Temple Judaism and Christianity, you can find this in the Hebrew Bible, but in a
different way. I'm not even going to waste my time. They're like wanting you too fast, right?
There's this huge emphasis on like, don't do the food or bring food to the temple. You got to give
God food. And because if we're hungry, God's got to be hungry. And then the other idea is the sex,
like either procreate to have babies and be saved as one of the, one of the pastoral
epistles says, or no, no more sex. This is actually bad because this goes back to the
garden type of thing. It's like built into our stories. And it's actually harmful if you,
in a way, you can kind of say like, just trying to reduce this. Remember, Derek, I started with
the two things that identify you as a living organism. I said, sustaining yourself, and that's
food, energy, and reproduction. And religion is sometimes can be actually genius because that's
humanity finding out that these two elements are so crucial and so important. And it's always,
I mean, we haven't, we haven't gone away from it. It's food porn and porn. We're still living in
the, we haven't really gone away from these two primal instincts that far. There's still dominates
quite a lot. If you, if you go to scroll your YouTube videos, and you'll find like, you know,
even though you're like, you know, moral person, you love your wife, you stop without you realizing
at certain things that have food or sex. And you don't know why, but you did go like this,
and I'll scroll and some super pretty girls on there. And I'm like, and then my wife goes, you
pause. And I'm like, what do you mean? What do you mean? What's for dinner? What are you talking about?
I kept scrolling. Nice try. Nice try. And now I know why she likes to get all dressed up or
tries to like, she wants to keep my attention, you know, and it's kind of funny that you bring that
up. But it's, it's primal. It's, it's, I mean, you can say whatever you want to say, but these two
things are deeply rooted in the human nature is nothing. It's, you know, you can deal with it in
a better way. We can make fun of it, but it's, and that's why religion used them quite cleverly,
and they control them. If you control these two, you control the person. You know, that's why the
biblical, the Torah and the Old Testament, the amount of things that you couldn't eat as a Jew
is like, and without even explanation, you can't eat this, you can't eat this. And I was like,
what would God worry about foods? What's that to do with anything? It's interesting. Yeah,
they control what, what you eat, and they have their own reasons and weird in different ways.
It's kind of strange in some ways, why, but it reminds me of that song. I smell sex and candy.
You know what I'm talking about? I was thinking about that as you were saying. I was like,
maybe they were thinking about our evolution when they wrote that song. I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, we got another super chat. So I do really appreciate all the support and love. If you
have a question, get it in. Because after this, I've got to help a family member and I don't want
to put them on the spot by mentioning their name, but they're struggling with addiction right now.
Fetinol actually overdosed many times in the past. And so I'm doing my very best to try and get them
into treatment, separating them physically from their environment to give them a chance at changing
the cycle that they've been living in. I've had two best friends overdose and die in the past.
And I don't want to see any other loved ones overdose and die if I can help it. So I got to
put on my cape and I got to go out there and try and save as much as I can. So I really appreciate
it. Minderbender, thank you again for the support. Let's have fun. Perhaps at the expense of caution.
At what threshold would you surmise an orgasm is conscious or orgasm? Sex and candy. Here we are.
Organism. I said that. Don't take my words out of context. What's your minimum?
You know what's on my mind. Well, these animals that we're talking about
at the very beginning, the one that uses chemical receptors, they have consciousness,
but a small part of it or an primitive version that was good enough. Remember,
everything you have is good enough for you to survive your habitat.
Would our consciousness get even better? Yeah, maybe the frontal cortex will get bigger.
The adrenaline gland will get smaller so that we're not as emotional. Who knows about the future
of the human species? We might actually be a lot more rational, but at what expense? Because there
are always trade-offs. Remember, we don't want a very rational society that we eventually would
like that movie with Christian Bale equilibrium that we always bring up. I love that movie.
I love that movie too. I'm not religious, but I still think there's a place for music and emotions
and poetry. And it does not have to be supernatural. But remember that scene where he must kill the puppy
because nobody was allowed to keep any art. And he looks at the puppy and freezes and says,
well, I can do that. My favorite part is when he starts to wake up. It actually equates to my
addiction story, which is why it hits so hard. He starts to wake up and his own wife, that was
where it was like, here we are with morality and my empathy. And I was like, his own wife,
he then realized what she was, and then the kids, they're little gangster kids.
Oh, horrible kids. But remember that scene where, because you remember, they had to have the windows
covered because they're not allowed to see any sunsets for any emotions to be evoked. And he saw
the first sunset, he started crawling and crying. It's just a sunset, but then it's little things
that you take for granted. Things like a sunset or watching the ocean from the mounting cliff and
little free things like that that make you go, well, life is beautiful, sort of thing. You can
take these little things for granted. And it's always going to be in my memory.
Yeah. And I hope that what we're doing today doesn't cause people to lose that artistic,
I hope they find more of it and find more meaning. And I think that's the hard part,
is thinking of this completely as chemicals, compounds. It's like, no, we need to recognize
our experience and recognize these feelings and embrace them. And go deep into it.
The two hardest atheists you can think about, Hitchens and Dawkins. Whenever they talk about
this bit, they are very emotional about it. Dawkins sing Christmas carols in the shower,
because he loved them. He would join in prayer over Christmas dinner, because it's the right
and polite thing to do, even though he's an atheist, because he said the words don't mean
anything to me, but I want to be kind to those who provided me dinner and I want to be nicer.
Thanksgiving dinner. I did the same. I joined in with them, but I didn't pray. They even asked me
to, my mom put me on the spot. I got a little bit embarrassed because I didn't do it, not because
I don't know how to recite the same things I've said my whole life. It was, I knew people there
that would have felt disrespected because, but mom was like, I'm just joking, but I got embarrassed
a little like, I don't want to be rude. So I feel you even like Ricky, Ricky Gervais,
like a comedian, English Ricky Gervais, he's an atheist and he's a full out of atheists. He
always, he appears on with Sam Harris. He appeared on Sam Harris. He appeared with
Dawkins a couple of times, but he always makes sure in any of his
series or movies that we insert a scene where he is confronted and challenges an atheist,
either heart atheism or an act of kindness. So his mother was dying and she goes, I'm going to
see you in heaven and we're going to meet again. And he could have told mom, don't waste your
last few seconds by believing in stupid things, but he wouldn't. He would actually say, yeah,
yeah, of course I'll see you in heaven and we're going to sing and you have to do that as an atheist.
I mean, yeah, like not everyone sees the world that through the same eyeballs, you know,
and I appreciate people who do that. I had a friend, one of my best friends who overdosed
actually, his sister called me and was talking about, well, God must have took him
because he was too good for this world. You know what I said? Actually, no, I said, you're right.
She's traumatized. She found her brother. He had like 30 minutes, 35 minutes with no oxygen
in the brain and that was it. He was brain dead, but his blood was still pumping, but it was over.
And so you got to, you got to learn where to die on what hills and you got to be smart about how
you approach this stuff. Yeah, so anyway, yeah, thank you so much for that. Bradford Baldwin,
where do you place heuristics and consciousness and how did you assess them in your work?
Well, I've got to say here and that word that I've done here, it's actually not mine.
This is, this has already been provided by Patricia Churchland. So if you go and google Patricia
Churchland, she has lots of conversations. She is a neurophilosopher because I believe the
area of consciousness is where philosophy and neurology and heart science can actually meet
for the first time. And that work has been done. So that is pretty much her view and I've adopted
it. It makes complete sense. Patricia Churchland, please google the name. She's Canadian, I believe.
She's got wonderful, wonderful chats about this particular subject. So it just makes sense to me
because it connects area of science and evolution, areas that have been, every time we looked at
anything that is complex and emergent, it seems to stem from simpler forms. And I think something
as convoluted and complex as consciousness could have not just emerged like that, unless it's
emergent. Nothing like that sort of comes. Suddenly, there are usually smaller steps and I think it
makes complete sense in that sort of narrative that are provided. So, but I'm open-minded because
it's at the very end and I must say it's a hypothesis. We still don't know. Remember,
these sort of sciences are more like forensic sciences. We're trying to go back in time. We're
trying to speculate what have happened. And as you said, Derek, we had a time machine, of course,
by the way, just something that's forbidden in cosmology and physics. You can never go back in
time. You can go back, you can go to the future, but you cannot go back in time because of entropy,
unfortunately. Why have an AC entropy machine? So, screw it.
Thank you so much. And yeah, I've seen this, if you're interested in the video you took some of
the images from, that's a really popular consciousness video that has millions of views
in the cartoon. And it's all about food. So, they're kind of like giving you a cartoony, fun,
very popular level example of how consciousness arrived and why they don't go into the explanation
of eyes arriving and giving you all the details. They kind of explain the process in a
drive-by airplane view kind of thing. But thank you so much for that question. Contextual
religion says, help it out, bro. F- excuse me, fentanyl. Just don't want YouTube to hit me.
But you know what, heroin, fentanyl, all of it, I actually named a video on my other channel
when I was really active on the recovery channel. F my brother's best friends, heroin and cocaine,
because at the time my brother was struggling and he's open about it. Dude, he's overcoming.
He's not dealing with those things today and I'm proud of him. But yeah, F heroin, F fentanyl,
all of this stuff, man. F fentanyl is the drug. I've been hearing some news here from Australia.
They found about 400 million doses in the US recently apparently.
I would be sure. Even locally, they caught someone here with, I can't remember how much,
someone was transporting it F fentanyl. I imagine they got it from Mexico, not a hundred.
Yeah, it's killing people. Little blue. Yeah, it's enough doses to kill the entire American
population. 401 each, take a dose. Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to do everything I can to help, but
I am one man too. So thank you for that. Really appreciate it. Hang fashy or shy. Forgive me
if I butcher your name. Does this put to bed the naturalistic fallacy? So naturalistic fallacy,
if it's natural, then it must be true. Well, you see, the proposition of the naturalistic fallacy
is pre proposing that something is true because it's natural or because it's explained by nature.
But we're not doing that. We're not being said because it's natural. It must be the most plausible
way of doing it. But we're providing it, we're providing evidence for it. And we still remain
with a little bit of skepticism saying, well, there could be something else that could have
happened in the past. And we're open to that. So we're not really committing naturalistic fallacy
by providing a naturalistic emergence for consciousness. It seems to be plausible.
And, you know, and we're open minded to it. So I don't think we're committing it because
we're not saying it must have happened that way. Yeah. I mean, I guess you could reverse it, right?
If you wanted to do a theistic fallacy, you could, you know, find a way to.
But I think some people just recognize the awe and wonder and they cannot picture how we got to
this point, even if they do try to factor an evolution without some mind or something involved.
And I come at this completely different. And there's a reason I don't draw that model. But
I don't know where I'll be at in 10 years. Who knows what I learn or what causes me to step
over that boundary into whatever. I want to remain a human who, who's open minded to learning
and knows his limitations, but thinks a certain model makes the most sense. And this is where I'm
at. I mean, and if we keep finding evidence that points in that direction, I'm going to,
that model sounds like it's on the right track. I can't, I'm not omniscient on its future predictions
or I'm not omniscient when it comes to even the knowledge of these things. But when that model
continuously seems to work and be what makes the most sense in the data, I tend to work with that
model. And so I don't think we should be like, naturalism is the absolute and we know it's like
if it works, you know, it's built in credibility by now, I think, you know, it's every time we
look back at ended up being that. So I'm still skeptical, you know, I'll leave a little bit
of a gap, but it seems to be working every time we've used it. It's worked. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I don't know. There's so many things out there to learn. Thank you for that. Super chat.
Really appreciate it. And I want to come back to your channel again. And just so everybody knows
where to go, I pinned it in the chat. And you can go subscribe right now, critical faculty.
You have anything coming up on your channel? Do you have any plans in 2023 that you could
tell us about? I was going to have a little bit of a break. But I think in the next few days,
I'm going to have Dr. Robert Price, we're going to be talking about Joseph of Arimathea and
John the Baptist. I've got Lawrence Kraus early next year. And I've got Hamid of the summit. I
think I'm trying to try to sit you up with him before. He's the most prominent Muslim atheist
in the Arabic world at the moment. Is he like a apostate? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I'll sit
you up with him and we'll really have a chat. You've already started a chat with him. He written
so many books. He lives in Germany and he's a lecturer in Germany at universities. But this
is the sort of guy that when he turns up, you know, there's like a few thousand people watching
live sort of thing. He's very, very... So if you go up above now again and go home, I think,
this guy there on top, here. This guy. Okay. Yeah. Well, send that information. Try and connect me
again. I know that he was in contact with me at one point at least. We worked communicating. We
didn't talk anymore after that. But so you've got some work coming up on your channel for sure.
Yeah. A bit of English and a bit of Arabic. Again, I'm not trying to do religion because I think
there's enough channels that will sort of attack religions directly. I'm trying not to do that
because I feel there is a gap in knowledge. And I think once good information come in in the head,
they will eventually spill out the bad information. So I'm trying to do it organically. I'm not
trying to confront, especially from a Muslim background and Christian. But the Muslim background,
that you don't treat them the same way, that everything is plastic to me and your head could
be gone within seconds. So he tried to be not too confrontational. And first of all, to tell him that
evolution hasn't collapsed in the West, as they claim. And intelligent design is not the
reigning scientific theory. So I try to do cosmology and science and biology. And every
now and then I touch on religion, but not very confrontational on that. Yeah, I think I spend
a lot of time there. I've had a lot of thought there. And I guess that's why it's really a,
I'm going to use the term because it's Christmas time, it's a blessing
that I get to do this and do this full time. And I love to do this. I love to learn about these
things and to dive deep. And in fact, I love expanding out into the science realm too, because
it is part of that journey. So it's not like, it's like I do what I love, and I'm expanding my love
for more things like history and strange things that aren't so-called underneath the religious
topic. I make it relevant. I try to sometimes spin it in to see how this is relevant to what the
narrative we've been telling ourselves for thousands of years or this religion or that
religion tells us. But I would love to expand out into Roman civilization, into Greek civilization,
into the ancient civilizations and how they arrived at their myths and what we've discovered
archaeologically and, I mean, history and science and philosophy and all of these things I will
religion is very interesting theology. I mean, I mean, I'm not one of those atheists. I love the
Bible. This is crazy. I like the Quran because it shows me how we used to think in the past.
This is very valuable, even if we made it up ourselves. I mean, I know we've written it,
and therefore it's actually a lot more valuable than God written it because it tells me how we
used to think in the past. So I'm a lover of human literature, even if it's bad and led to bad
things, but how are we going to avoid future problems if we don't understand lessons from the
past? And remember, Islam is six and a half centuries younger than Christianity. So we're
probably going through the same right now, the time where you guys in our six, six centuries ago
imagine trying to post Christianity and being confrontational about Galileo, didn't fare well,
and Bruno had even a worse destiny than him. But you know, the world of Christianity some
six centuries ago would have been you imagine trying to do what you're trying to do right now
six centuries ago. Wow. Yeah. And I'm at a good time in history. I'm privileged to do it. So I
want to spread information. Oh snap pocket locker with the last minute bomb drop just
great show. I think it's important to distinguish between scientific uncertainty
and doubt. I think those who doubt naturalism are unreasonable.
Well, this double PhD over here and knows evolution and so I don't know. Have you
heard of pocket locker? No, unfortunately not. I got to connect you to him, Jay. So he's definitely
he just did a show recently. You got to go subscribe to Jay. If you want to enter evolution heaven,
you know, because there is a heaven for those who evolve and think evolution is the case,
you got to go subscribe to pocket locker 86. You know what they say if you don't,
you'll evolve into some insignificant creature that just it's chasing its own tail and you
don't want that you want to procreate you want to enjoy your endorphins and opiate receptors
and all that because all of that stuff goes away if you don't subscribe right now. Anyway,
shout out to Jay for being funny. Might want to invite him for a chat, but you know,
this is the going debate, you know, naturalism. Well, it falls off fundraiser, you know,
it's it's it's less steps less conflicted. It's a it's the simplest of all explanations.
Because and you can you can prove it. You can prove it. You can have evidence first and you can
this is this is the telling point for me. You can build tech technology on the back of sciences,
empirical sciences that yields results. Evolution give rise to antibiotic antibiotic follows
rules of evolution. If you're the bacteria that you're trying to fight for the antibiotic gets
used to the antibiotic, you're that's why you got to change it every 30 days. It follows it. They
evolve. So it's got usages, naturalism and the sciences have got tech to back it up. Unfortunately,
with the other claims with the supernatural claims, there isn't any evidence, even prayers
don't work. We've got evidence of prayers of people being prayed for in hospitals.
They're doing exactly the same as those who have never been prayed for that and sometimes even worse.
Yeah, because they feel guilty that they were not recovering fast enough. So it's incredible.
Well, bless your soul. I appreciate everybody in the chat. Hit that like button, drop a comment,
share this with someone who's not a naturalist and those who are naturalist, of course.
Be sure to subscribe to my friend, Hannie here and go check out his stuff. Drop comments because
he's entering not only the English world where people speak English, which makes up less than 10%
of planet Earth. He is in the Arabic world. He's actually directly speaking to people who are
speaking Arabic. So he's actually communicating these ideas we discussed today in a world that
this is actually very strange informed to many of them. We at least have had a century and a half,
two centuries where it's just been commonly discussed. I'm not saying it hasn't been discussed
in Arabic. It's just now, I think, really starting to try and make an impact and he's
on the front lines of that. So go support what he's doing as I do and thank you so much, Hannie.
I really appreciate you. Thank you so much, Derek. I always enjoy your fantastic channel. I've been
telling you off air as well. You've become one of the most important outlets out there to discuss
biblical scholarship. The amount of academics that come to your channel, the seriousness of the
topics you provide, the way you're so professional about going about things. I think this channel
is not too far away from achieving that YouTube shield. I think I'm going to see it probably
by the end of next year behind you. Yeah, I hope so, man. I'll put it behind me. It is an honor to
be able to be alive and where I'm at. So thank you, Hannie. I hope that you get a lot of subscribers
from this and I really appreciate the audience for all the support. Never forget, we are MythVision.
