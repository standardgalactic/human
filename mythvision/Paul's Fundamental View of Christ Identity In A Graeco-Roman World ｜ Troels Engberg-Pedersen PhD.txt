Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an episode about the Apostle Paul, a deep dive where
Trolls Inberg Peterson is going to tell us about Paul and identity. Does his theology and philosophy
and in some ways, can we better understand what the Apostle Paul's writing to whom? Why? What's
he saying? What is his philosophy? What does he say when he talks about the penuma, the spirit?
And is it immaterial or is it some form of a material? There's so many things we unravel
in this episode. We discussed Paula Frederickson's view, particularly on Paul and things he agrees
with and maybe disagrees with. You're going to want to stay tuned. You'll have a better grasp
of Paul by the end of this episode. Don't forget to check out my Patreon to help support MythVision,
early access this video and many others. We are MythVision. Welcome back to MythVision podcast.
I have a special guest today and I hope I pronounce your name. It's Dr. Trolls at Inberg
Peterson, correct? Excellent. Wonderful. Yes, it couldn't be better.
I'm surprised because I always butcher my pronunciation of things. So do you mind me
calling you Dr. Peterson or what do you prefer? Trolls is fine. Trolls. Okay. I will try my best
to stick to that because I was raised by a mom and dad. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am.
I'm Danish and we are a little bit different on that point. Awesome. Well, thank you, Trolls,
for joining me today on MythVision podcast. Let me give everybody a little background.
There's so much to say here, but Trolls is classics. He is at Copenhagen from 1967 to 74 on
Ancient Philosophy at Oxford in 1974 to 76. Results, among other things, Aristotle's Theory
of Moral Insight, 1983. The Stoic Theory, and I'm going to butcher this. Is it Okeosis?
Well, very well. Yes, yes, yes. That's good. Okeiosis, but never mind. Okeiosis. There's a
pronunciation in Greek that was in 1990 and the New Testament, Copenhagen, 1986 from 2000
as a professor, results. Paul, in his Hellenistic context, 1994, I feel like it should actually
be showing the books for the sake of it while we're doing this because everybody needs to go get a
copy. And the one we're going to talk about is Paul on Identity, but who knows where the
conversation will go because I want to cover all your works, to be honest, at some point.
So Paul on the Stoics, Paul beyond Judaism, Hellenism Divide in 2001, Cosmology and Self in
the Apostle Paul, the Material Spirit. That sounds like an interesting thing. Everyone thinks the
spirit is immaterial. We need to talk about that. That was in 2010. Also more recently on the Gospel
of John, John and Philosophy, a new reading of the Fourth Gospel in 2017. I'm so curious.
Right now, work on Paul and philosophy, selected essays, and this is for 2023 to appear in a
prestigious German series. And here belongs two research semesters at Yale, 1987 and 2001.
This meant close to acquaintance and collaboration with Abraham Malherb. Am I saying that correct?
Malherby. Malherby. Yeah. Wayne Meeks, Richard Hayes, I know of them. Del Martin, I know of him.
Eventually, Harry Attritch. Of course, I've interviewed Dr. Harold Attritch and many more
since 1987, about 30 annual meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature
and here, the Hellenistic Moral Philosophy in the New Testament group and the Pauline Theology
Group, both 1980s to 1990s. Did I miss anything, trolls, or mess up on anything here?
Absolutely not. You were quite right. I did mention to you myself these
stays at Yale and also the fact that I have gone to all these SPL annual meetings.
And that is because it has been tremendously important to my work to have this contact with
extremely wonderful scholars in the United States. You see, when I started out as a sort of
philosopher, as you mentioned, it was Oxford and Oxford was at that time a highly flourishing
university for both philosophy in general and also ancient philosophy. But then when I turned
into the New Testament, I was looking around to find out where is the most important work being
being done in the New Testament. And I came to Yale and that was tremendously
helpful and fruitful for my own work. And I keep, I have contact with people,
Yaleians as it were, still right now. So that's important to me to stress that. Also,
during my work, I have had a lot of contact with people in the Nordic countries working
in the New Testament. I've learned enormously from them and also gradually in Germany.
But there is a sort of pattern here, first England, then the United States,
all through the Nordic countries, then gradually also Germany.
I really enjoyed in your book in particular, because you have a lot to offer,
myth vision here. We're an educational platform. We try to take, how do I put this in?
This is not disrespectful to scholarship. This is actually respectful to scholarship. But
scholarship, in my opinion, is almost hiding underneath the lampstand. And the general public
has no clue. They feel like they have to pay for a university to go and learn. And I get it,
it's expensive. We try to take that stuff that average folks think are boring or
that's, you got to be brilliant to understand and chew it up and spit it out for the general
public to get a little taste. Wow, this is actually very important and interesting material,
especially if you want to know what the New Testament authors are saying or Old Testament
or Hebrew Bible being respectful of Jews. But you in your book, there's a scholar you
mentioned William Reed. I was writing an article about this particular, the secret Messiah complex
that's going on in Mark. And you said this is one of your, one of your favorite scholars in history
was learning from William Reed in 19. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Well, he died in 1910,
as I recall. But well, first of all, he was a scholar who was not at all afraid of tearing
down what everybody else had been saying if it could, if it couldn't stand up. And he did that
boldly and without, you know, looking left or right or anything. And secondly, he also had this
impulse to write in such a way that it was intelligible, intelligible to everybody.
In fact, I think I mentioned in that Paul on identity that, that he wrote a sort of
folks book about Paul. And that means a book that was intended for the whole people,
which is a wonderful idea. It is also a very good book, but so many things have happened in
Paul in studies that one couldn't just, you know, translate it and then say, this is what we know
about Paul. So I had that very much in mind, whether I have succeeded is a different matter,
but that at least was, at least was the idea. Well, if I could take a second just to let
everybody know, please go get a copy of his works. In fact, I'm enjoying this book so much,
you're going through the authentic letter to Paul, of course, trying to get a better grasp of what
Paul means. And I was reading, not only do you talk to my mind, you'll Derek, the one I can see
here is Darlan philosophy, which of course is a wonderful book too, but we are talking about
Paul on identity. Yeah, okay. Right, right. And in your book, I was going to say Del Martin, right?
I've actually had a phone conversation one night with Dr. Martin, and he takes an approach,
as we're diving into this, I just want to mention, he takes this approach where he says, you know,
people don't, you know, people don't care, most people don't care why Mozart wrote his first
symphony. And in fact, you mentioned this in your book about symphonies in Mozart. So I was like,
okay, this is interesting that you're bringing this up, because I had a phone call with Del
Martin, and he said, people are more concerned with how they interpret the first symphony of Mozart
and how it means to them. And, and while I get that, and you try to take this balance in your
introduction as book of how does Paul matter to us? However, I have to be honest, my goal,
even though it may be an unachievable goal, is to try and understand the zeitgeist, the matrix in
which Paul lived, his audience, what the problems they dealt with, what was Paul, what did Paul
mean? What was he saying? And why was he saying it? And Del, Del said, well, you're asking to walk
on water, because in Del's mind, he's acting like it's not possible. Do you just don't even try?
He tried to tell me, don't even try. Well, you're wasting your time. And I'm, I feel like I'm not
wasting my time. I want to, I want to know what Paul meant in your book, your book about this on
Paul and identity is a must get. So please go get the book, ladies and gentlemen, and also support
us on Patreon. This episode will air on Patreon first for those who support us here to help us
continue educating the world. I have tons of videos with John Dominic Crossen, Christopher D.
Stanley, I've done some with Del C. Allison Jr., James Tabor, the list goes on and on. There are
academics, I'm even trying to get ahold of Dr. Paula Fredrickson, who I am hoping to get on
MythVision sometime this year. And that will be there for those who help support us. Enough about
my introduction. I just, I want to know what Paul means. And so I have to pass this off to you on
your research agenda. If you don't mind telling us what your agenda is. Okay, this will be a little
well, first of all, I want to thank you for expressing your, what is it, interest in trying to
get to understand what Paul himself meant in his own context, because that is also hard of what I'm
very much after. And when you say that Dale Martin says that that is impossible, Dale is a very good
friend of mine. And we've been talking about these things over and over again. We disagree on that.
He has a rather fancy view that that's impossible. I don't agree. I see all the obstacles and that
is up to us to be clear on them. But I certainly think that there's something approaching the
historical facts is possible to reach. So when we now discuss a little bit about my research
agenda, one thing that I have been very concerned to show and help people come to see is that the
so-called divide between Judaism and Hellenism doesn't work. You mentioned rightly a book I edited
in 2001 called Paul Beyond the Judaism Hellenism Divide. And that was precisely a collection of
articles with among other contribution by Dale Martin. And the aim of it was to show that
this automatic reaction we have that something is Jewish and something else is Hellenistic or
Greek or Roman or etc. This automatic reaction should be questioned. There may be certain elements
in it, but we cannot just start out from there. We have to look very carefully at each particular
topic etc. and find the roots etc. and also be aware that there may be absolutely no divide of
that kind in the minds of say in this case Paul himself. Or perhaps it would be better to say that
but this is something we'll come back to I suppose that Paul was and remained a Jew. But that did
not exclude that he also was aware of what we consider to be specifically
Hellenistic or Greek or Roman namely philosophy and that he might make use of that. These two
things do not go together, go against one another in the way we are accustomed to thinking. And I
think that is a very important point to keep in mind. It may sound as if everybody now agreed on
that but in fact when you look at what people are saying you can see that it is at the back of our
minds and in an unfruitful way. So that has been the first topic as it were on my research agenda.
If I may on that particular those two topics I've been reading with Im David Litva who's written
on how the Gospels became history and stuff and in his books not just that the Yesus Deus
and other great works that I've enjoyed he points out that that whole divide of like oh there's
Hellenism and then there's Judaism and it's like no in many academics such as yourself
have been writing about this and saying you know you think you're looking at something and you
think that's the opposite no even in the most sectarian groups of Judaism that we would call
were Hellenized and so you're looking at the Dead Sea Scrolls these people were Hellenistic
thinkers in some respects and we would call them the most conservative maybe.
Also on the other coin I've had academics who want to push back on Paul knowing philosophy and stuff
and they say well maybe he has an idea because it's in the air but he's not really into it and
I did a recent interview with Christopher D Stanley who's a Pauline scholar and he said that
when Paul uses terms like Jew and Greek he uses Greek he's not like Jew and Gentile or you know
the nations he uses Greek specifically and he says and maybe we can get into this at some
point during your interview that Paul is in both worlds kind of like what Philo of Alexandra is
he's both Greek and Jewish and he's tearing down both ideas the Jews think that they have what it
takes they think they got it all well the Greeks think the same thing that they have a high pedigree
they think there's something so he uses this term for both categories to say no your philosophy
you know it's foolishness to you and Jews want signs it's foolishness to you he has this new Christ
program this Jesus program if you will that that he thinks is going to somehow fix it I don't know
where this is going to go but I'm interested in your agenda yeah okay this is something one might
really discuss in in some detail it has to do with 1st Corinthians chapter one and and two
may I just say in direct response to what you've been saying that one reason why he uses Greek
there I think is that he's talking about well as you said the Jews go for something and then the
Greeks go for something else namely Sophia and that is one word that they used for what we would
call philosophy or the kind of insight you get from philosophy and it may very well be that he
felt that that was particularly well part of what it meant to be a Greek that you had this kind of
cultural heritage but that actually leads me to my second point on my research agenda which is to
try to convince everybody that Paul was also a philosophical thinker even though he was a Jew
and he remained a Jew etc precisely due to this intermix of Hellenism or Greek thought and Judaism
we have also to accept that he operated in a manner that we would call
philosophical in places not everywhere he has also certain ideas about the Messiah etc etc
that do not belong to philosophy but in many places and it has often to do with
when he is trying to explain things about the law the Messiah law he does become philosophical I would
say and I could explain to you what that means what defines philosophy here but the main point
is really that he is in places working as a philosopher he did not see himself as a
philosopher far from it he was the apostle of Christ etc etc but he works in such a way that
when we look at the context etc we will have to say yes okay he is working like a philosopher
I would say I'm not a philosopher but I'm fairly confident if you listen to me you'll probably go
he knows some philosophy and I have read some I'm just not a philosopher per se
now in particular you were going to get into like the specific profile I'm interested in hearing
let's dive in yeah okay well there are a number of elements in that and one in fact has to do
with what we were talking about situating Paul within a Jewish and Hellenistic context etc
my specific profile in that respect is that I'm not really so interested in whether we should say
that Paul was Jewish or Paul was Jewish and Hellenistic or something like that as if we were to
draw up the results of scholarly investigation and then we know that and we are happy and we can
turn somewhere else and never mind about that what I'm more interested in is to try to use
the material that we get to get hold of when we are doing that kind of comparative work comparing
Paul with other Jewish thinkers like Philo of Alexandria whom you mentioned a moment ago
or comparing him with philosophers Greek or Roman even philosophers I'm more interested in
what can we get out of that to understand Paul better that that is my main aim really
because I have the foolish or not so foolish idea that once you understand Paul in his historical
context better than we perhaps did before then you have also learned something that you may
eventually use in this or the other way either by rejecting it or by accepting parts of it we
can come to that later but the point is that I want to understand Paul better so it's not
if it doesn't work to bring in philosophy for comparison then I'll just skip philosophy in a
way but I do think that it that it works and that is the that is the reason why I keep bringing in
ideas from Hellenistic Roman Greek Roman philosophy to see whether it helps elucidate
specific arguments and Paul's in this or the other place this is exactly my goal in fact this is
this is what I would say you're you're saying to our good friend Martin Del Martin like hey
I want to figure this out I understand that you would say hey the New Testament is art and it's
it's reinterpreted through every generation I get it and and I have fun looking through church
history and watching how the church fathers reinterpret the book of Revelation through
history different people thought the beast is this and that and this this pope and you name it
this president whatever that's fun but that doesn't get to the answer for me I get it you do this
with anything I want to know what Paul I mean you can go to the newspaper and reinterpret the
newspaper if you want yeah what is Paul doing and I like your idea of comparing him to other
philosophers so maybe we could dive into some of these discoveries that you've made of Paul is
sure another special element in my profile is and everybody knows that who knows my name as it
were but there it is I believe that one philosophy in particular in that period namely so-called
stoicism is more relevant to understanding Paul than what we have usually taken to be the most
relevant type of philosophy namely so-called middle Platonism here I should perhaps explain a
little bit we have Plato and Aristotle back in the fourth century BCE and then from around 300 BCE
we have a peculiarism and stoicism as the main philosophers or philosophical schools
there weren't that many questions who were interested in Epicurus well part there are
elements in Epicurus and isn't that irrelevant to New Testament but I would say that if you look at
overall picture in that period it was stoicism that was the strongest kind of philosophy but
eventually and that is the interesting thing in the first century CE and onwards that is into the
first century CE etc Platonism returned in what we call middle Platonism eventually also Aristotle
and Aristotelianism which is closely related to Platonism also came into the overall picture
but that is a bit later so there is a period between 100s BCE and 100 CE where there is a
battle going on between stoicism on the one hand and middle Platonism on the other and that I think
is where we should place as it were Paul and parts of the New Testament also so for people like me
who are completely ignorant of philosophy if you might elucidate what is the difference or what is
Platonism and what are the key differences because you can probably get lost and pull out 100 books
on Platonism or what are the key elements that make Platonism and stoicism and those differences
and why is Paul one and not the other if you put it very very basically and it's a way of putting it
that that will be immediately I believe contested but I think there is actually still some truth to
it one should say that stoicism is fundamentally materialist and monist and that means that the
stoics are in fact reacting against Plato and Plato had you may have heard about the ideas and
phenomenal world etc a kind of dualism that the stoics were reacting against they insisted
that everything in the world was some kind of material very very refined of course in the case
of God even all things like that but still material whereas the Platonist and also the middle
Platonist they absolutely wanted to stress the dualism that the ideas were immaterial whereas
then of course the phenomenal world was material and there was this sharp distinction in the basic
metaphysics and that is what I'm playing on in that title you mentioned on Paul on the
material spirit that in understanding Paul this is my contention we need to understand the spirits
the Pneuma which plays a huge role in Paul in material terms this is something we can come
back to because it's that that is where I believe that this idea of using external philosophy to
elucidate Paul actually helps a lot that we can suddenly understand better what he is saying
whenever he talks about the Pneuma if we take it to be well basically a material entity that can
interact with other material entities like our bodies I was reminded of first Corinthians 15
and I know we're diving into all but this resurrection scene is caused quite a debate quite
a stir among the community that I am involved in on on YouTube where there are the Orthodox
Christian perspective which I don't you know believe but that they say well there's continuity
in Paul's concept of resurrection of the of this new body that is coming is literally like what Luke
and John are saying where he's eating fish and he's physical and he's like physical body and then
when I try to talk to some scholars like Steve Mason and James Tabor and others it's confusing
because they'll say stuff like well Paul believes it's matter of some sort but it's not flesh and
blood it's not physical in the body like what we're talking about so the Orthodox view within
the creeds and all they got that wrong but there's some truth to it being a physical spirit
absolutely yeah but but this is a very good point one of my key passages is precisely
first Corinthians 15 where he talks about this resurrection body and comes out saying that just
as there is a psychic body meaning evidently our body as it were which is full of the psyche
the soul so there also is a body that is pneumatic a body that is pneumatic so it is something that
must be somehow material but he also goes on to say that a flesh and blood cannot be resurrected
so he does clearly operate with a different type of bodyliness for the pneumatic body and if you
want to understand that then I believe that precisely Stoicism is the best place to go because
there the Pneuma plays a huge role and they go to some go some way to explain the material character
of the Pneuma which is in fact in their philosophy all over the world that is different from Paul
in Paul's case the Pneuma is something specific that God gives to Christ believers it's not
it's not elsewhere in the world so there is an important difference between Stoicism and Paul
but still if you want to understand how the Pneuma works in Paul I think it's much better to have
such an idea at the back of your mind than well I don't know how else you would would actually
explain that passage and if I can just make one additional point you are so right in mentioning
Stephen Mason and Tim's table here because one thing I have come to see I hope at least to believe
is that in order to understand the well I start again in spite of the fact that we have Philo
of Alexandria who was a Jew and a Platonist in spite of that fact I believe that in order to
understand what Paul is saying as a Jew Stoicism is better because it's closer to well a traditional
way of thinking of God and divine intervention and things like that namely as material facts.
This is so wonderful that you bring that up I don't have the book do I? No there's a book by
Francesca Stabrakapoulou called God in Anatomy she just launched it and it's gone viral and it's
all about God's physical body in fact she was perplexed as a young girl going through these
temples and seeing there's God there's an image of a God and there's a Greek God and there's Athena
she loved temples and gods anyway the whole books about God having a physical body.
I also want to make a quick comment that I think is important to to make clear and to have your
answer do you think the reason people get confused on Paul and put him in the middle Platonism or
in some form a Platonism category is because one Philo we love to look to contemporary Jews
two does Josephus fit into this category three where you know church fathers they fall into the
Platonism middle and Neoplatonism and then also is there anywhere in the New Testament because
I see an evolution taking place where Platonism begins to be a model and so people are going
backwards maybe it's in the gospel somewhere and they go well Paul must have it because here it's
in the Gospels and connecting dots that don't connect if that makes sense right yes I think you're
right that there are vestiges of Platonism in the New Testament for instance in the letter to the
Hebrews that you have already discussed with Heriotret. So it's just a matter I can only repeat
myself here it's a matter of finding out what works best as it were in elucidating Paul but
can I just come back to what you said about seeing God in physical form etc etc that is not
definitely what I'm saying about Paul because I think that he distinguishes very clearly between
the kind of physicality that we may operate with in connection with God which is a pneumatic character
and then flesh and blood because he distinguishes so clearly and says that what will be resurrected
is a pneumatic body but flesh and blood cannot undergo this kind of resurrection so it's definitely
not a matter of you know seeing God in so many physical forms. On the contrary I believe strongly
that this is one place where Paul shows his Jewishness namely that he did not think of
God along the way that the Greeks or Romans etc did where you did have all these different
gods and you made statues of them etc there's a traditional criticism of that in Judaism
and I believe he it's not just a belief but it's clear that he is very much against that if you
think of Romans chapter 4 but if I can just put in here an interesting little point if we if we
think of Stoicism again in Stoicism you also find this kind of criticism of the physical
understanding of religion if I may put it like that for instance in Zeno who founded Stoicism
that there is a criticism of temples in the ideal city there will be no temples at all
because that is not part that God is as it were within so there is the same kind of idea
on this particular point in Stoicism as in Paul the Jew. Wow so much yeah I think that
Francesca Stabrakapulu actually does think there's an evolution that takes place especially after
Alexander the Great and Hellenism comes in the ideas have evolved you know every conquering
nation probably made an impact on the Jews so I imagine that's the case of course when Stoicism
is reacting to Plato and all this and I love that because it makes it reminds me of Acts 17
whether historical or not it looks almost like an Aristotle type of thing anyway it's a wonderful
passage absolutely and it just shows that Luke understood so very much of the whole context
within which early Christianity was developing. I love this I'm really interested in seeing Paul
trying to see Paul at least with what he's trying to do what is he actually trying to say what is
he actually trying to do and I think that your deep dive is going to help us understand Paul
better and this is my whole goal it's your goal too is there anything in the special profile that
you didn't cover that you would like to? Well let me see I was thinking about that so there's one
thing I would want to take up because this is something that I have come to see more and more
clearly if you were to ask me have my views about Paul and Stoicism developed I would answer yes
they have particularly in the following area in my first book on Paul and the Stoics from
the year 2000 I explicitly set aside I use that term set aside I was definitely aware of it but
I set it aside the the basic fact that Paul was an apocalypticist that is that he expected the
world to be the whole world to be transformed very soon this is something that is clearly shown
already in his earliest letter First Thessalonians and I believe that it is also clearly shown in
his latest letter that I take to be Romans in chapter 13 so he he he expected that and it's
enormously important that we realize that and don't forget it in our understanding and that
is where I have actually I think come to see something better or more whatever in comparison
with my early work where I focused only on as what we might call the ethics but the apocalyptic
idea is belongs under what we might call the Paul's theology and I have come to see that there is a
very close connection an intimate connection between his theology and his ethics I put it
in these scare quotes and that's that is ugly but that's because we have a clear sense of
I believe a distinction between theology on one hand and and ethics on the other because
there's been this kind of intellectual development in European cultures but in in Paul it's it's
it's not so clear he doesn't he I think he immediately thinks ethics the moment he speaks
about theology and he also which we may not like thinks that the proper ethics can only be had if
you have the proper theology but but I think what what I had missed as it were was this intimate
connection between between theology and ethics and here if we have time for it I would like
to mention that in the letter to the Philippians he says in chapter 127 he's talking about what
we would call ethics I looked it up here live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ
here incidentally what right after here is worthy of the gospel of Christ because that that ties
the way they should live that is ethically directly into the theology of the gospel of Christ
but here I would also mention that the term he uses for live your life is polytheistic and that
means live in society there is a distinct political element to it live in society police the police
is the city live in society in a manner that is worthy of the gospel of Christ and then he immediately
in chapter 2 of Philippians goes on explaining what how they should live and he first brings in
something about the Pneuma the spirit that he has and that they have and he says two verses here
do nothing from selfish ambition but in humility regard others as better than yourselves that each
of you look not to your own interests but to the interests of others I've written an article on
this last verse because it's so important that he says that each of you do not to your own
own interests but precisely to the interests of others the translation I've given you here
is from the new revised standard version and it's it's it's okay I just wonder what text they were
looking at because there is a problem about a small a small words they are Kai but it I have
what I wrote in this article is that it means but precisely to the interests of others so
he's urging them to turn their backs on their own interests and only look at and then he
continues let the same mind be in you namely the one we just heard about that was in Christ Jesus
when he came down from heaven etc etc there you see the closest imaginable connection between
something theological and the Essex directly here and now and this is something that I I hadn't
really graphed sufficiently I think in my in my first book but I in fact I make a lot of that in
Poland identity because I think it's so so important yeah you mentioned in your book like
you you say I'm putting square scare quotes but quotes but I'm not going to continue doing it from
here on right and uh and you're you're definitely trying to say there's a connection here with his
apocalypticism or his ethics and theology but you also talk about the apocalypticism as something
important in that particular phrase where it talks about care more for others than oneself
is that a stomach idea oh definitely yes that that is precisely one of the basic ideas in
the system that as you grow up as a human being you come to realize that what really matters is
not what you can as it will get for yourself but that you act on behalf of all human beings
for the very reason that they are like yourself human beings they have their minds etc etc and
that calls for this open attitude towards others forgetting about oneself so in that respect I
think there is a close connection between Stoicism and Paul do you think that Stoicism's impact on
Paul may explain his universalism and I say universalism not like not in a total like
post mortem you're everybody's going to be saved in the end some people argue Paul meant that Christ
will be all in all and maybe he does have that idea maybe I'm just saying as far as Paul's interested
in going to the broader world of non-jews right right do you think his philosophy has made an
impact on his mission that is a very good question I would be a little skeptical here for a number
of reasons one is that as I said already I think that he brings in philosophy only gradually
it's not so clear in the first his first letter the first first Thessalonians there I don't think
you have some of the base absolutely basic ideas in Paul about the Christ event and what it should
mean the Pneuma also the spirit enormously important but he doesn't spell it out in in
any great detail and and he doesn't do it at all I would say philosophically so I think he had his
basic as it were agenda from the very beginning without as it were having elaborated in it in
in a philosophical manner it's only later when as I said the problem of the law becomes pressing to
him that he wants to find ways of saying both that these non-jews in Galatia they should not
become circumcised they should not become Jews they should not in that sense live under the law
but at the same time also that once they have acquired Christ's face and they have received
the Pneuma they will in fact behave well as as dictated by or by the law they will fulfill
the law and that that requires some some explanation and that is where I think he brings in the
philosophy so I don't think that one can say that that his basic agenda which was of course to
address non-jews that it was dictated by his philosophy and and I'm also a little bit skeptical
I must say about I've been working a bit on it about universalism etc in a way there is a
universalism in poll 2 namely in the idea as you also hinting that non-jews might become
Christ believers etc etc and eventually resurrected just as Jews would or might be that is of course
a sort of universalistic idea but but I think that it it comes out of something else namely
the idea that the Christ event is something revolutionary that God has set as has created
of relevance it must be sensitive so revolutionary of relevance to any everybody etc plus the fact
that that the essence of the Christ event and it the way it functions on human beings is that they
they take it in as it were and it transforms them again via the Pneuma it transforms them so that
any ethical problems there may have been are resolved and and when you see the effect of
the Christ event in that way then you would immediately say well but then it must be relevant
to everybody but it's not because he has the idea of you know universalism somewhere and now we must
go etc etc I think it's what he comes from the Jewish background that it develops it from the
inside and that's that's a better way of seeing it I think there's I don't know if we'll ever
have enough time to go into all of the wonderful things we could get out of these conversations
because you reminded me of Christine Hayes she did a recording about what's so divine about divine
law lecture she did and she's talking about how Jews you know have their law and in Philo for
example he's trying to kind of compete in a way by making the Torah the law of Moses actually
equated with natural law or divine law and so it makes me think of Paul and Romans 1 where he's
like kind of doing what you're describing here where it's like it's like okay so the letter of the
law it'll kill like like but there's this it's written on their heart it's more of a Pneuma law
kind of thing yeah yes that's right but but what is it that is written on the law on their hearts
it is I believe the Mosaic law so so so he is not prepared to give that up at all I don't think
Philo either meant to do that but as you as Jews I think they they stick very strongly to the Mosaic
law but then they precisely as you say and I think there is a sort of parallelism between what you
said about Philo and what you find in Paul they try to to extend it and the relevance of the
law even to non-Jews. There's all sorts of great stuff so you you want to get into your own profile
on reading of Paul developed or well how it developed I think I have actually made the most
important point that that he starts out in First Thessalonians in a way that is not really
philosophical in in the way I define that but then under pressure in connection with these people
in connection with the Mosaic law etc he becomes more and more philosophical there it shows as it
were that he knew about these things and could draw them in whenever there was a need for it
and that is where I actually mentioned it's not Mosaic I must say but it's Beethoven it's it's
from the first symphony until the 9th symphony and I think if you think of the development from
First Thessalonians until Romans it is clear that he had this kind of mind that developed and developed
and developed and wanted to bring more and more material in and make it fit together etc and so
you have Romans which is of course a fantastic masterpiece in in world literature and and rightly
calls for for continuous investigation and so on. As you described that you kind of put the
apocalypticism to the side earlier and you've developed Paul within stoic thinking and diving deep
how in what way did does apocalypticism play a role in this understanding of Paul as a stoic
because if I may when I talk to scholars they go well we have to remember first Paul's a Jew
and I get that and we were talking about earlier in the beginning of this episode about how we
shouldn't try to dichotomize Paul and go well is he true or is he Hellenized he's both so if we have
an apocalyptic Jew and he's stoic and he's extremely Hellenized in some sense I'll just say
extremely even though it's like what does that even mean because right at this point everybody's
Hellenized they're all sweating Hellenism you know it's coming out of their pores but in what way
did the apocalypticism of Paul impact your understanding within stoicism of Paul?
Ah that is a good question because I think well yeah I could I was going to say that it didn't
that that his apocalyptic stance is part of his Jewish heritage and and and that is what as it
were creates a whole frame of all his thinking but then I also want to connect his apocalyptic
stance with the phenomenon of the Pneuma of which we have spoken it is a Pneuma that is given to
Christ believers and that lies behind the way they then live you know in the meantime between
now and the apocalyptic end and then also lies behind what happens at the apocalyptic end and
this Pneuma as we also were talking about is I think one that one understands best in terms of
stoicism so there is that kind of connection but the apocalyptic basic idea itself is not I think
relevant to stoicism apart from the fact which is of course is interesting that the Stoics too
had an idea of a development of the whole world that would end up in the big fire when everything
was as it were drawn into God and then there was a moment of silence before God then began
again to create the world that that kind of image or picture is found in stoicism too but but it is
it is very different from anything you'll find in Paul so I don't think that that that is really
that is one of the I don't think you learn so much from for understanding Paul from bringing in
this idea of the eventual conflagration as it is called of the world but you see that that is just
wonderful with me that I'm not after saying Paul was a Stoic or anything like that but trying to
find material that helps us understand him best I'm with you I definitely want to figure that out
as well and this is why I do what I do and talk to scholars do you think that this panuma that Paul
is discussing how to put this the evidence that he would use to his audience for example in the
Corinthians or in other people who are who are kind of doubting or questioning because some people
come after Paul trying to say Paul's not giving you the whole truth and whatnot Paul's frustrated
you can tell in some of his letters that's why I know these aren't epistolary fictions these
look so real and you mentioned that in your book too in the opening you're like these are let's go
ahead and get this off there's a guy a human here who's trying to frustratingly at sometimes trying
to convey a message but do you think the evidence of this panuma in speaking in tongues and stuff
like that I know this a little bit off topic but it's in the vein of all of this is similar
to like what sibling oracles and other Greeks were practicing things where they believed that
there were utterances and such that were coming what do you think that practice is as it relates to
Paul's non-jewish audience because I just don't know how that would be a Jewish practice it seems
more of like who's over here speaking in tongues and going into okay yeah okay well that's an
interesting question Derek I haven't actually thought of that as as as something to to work on
in 1st Corinthians 14 12 to 14 he does address this issue of speaking in tongues and and evidently
that is something that has been taking place in Corinth etc he of course raises
a finger and and says that you had better there's a problem about that if somebody comes in from
the outside and hears that what on earth and so so he he speaks for news which is well reason
rationality as it were uh intelligibility and to that extent against uh this speaking in tongues
but Paul of course being Paul he also managed to manages to put in that he of course speaks in
tongues better than anybody else but whether that is something that has its roots in what we call
Greek mysticism or not I just don't know nor do I know whether it is distinctly non-Jewish
that that might be interesting but I just don't know thank you so much I'm sorry I
rabbit other it just came to my mind yeah and I appreciate your response um you mentioned and I
believe as we're going into the profile of Paul as you know Paul's developed in your thinking you
mentioned Paula Fredrickson and I loved her book Paul the Pagan's Apostle right so did I and I think
the reason is we're trying to like imagine a Jew who has an apocalyptic framework as we discussed
who's looking to the scriptures Paul has a very how do I put this many Jews rabbis have
imaginations with their text and Paul has a big imagination that you know the text seems to be
alive even like he you know the way he interprets for example 1st Corinthians 9 after he's trying
to tell them like hey they can have wives and they can get money I don't want any of that but
does God really care for oxen you know for it is written and he's talking about don't muzzle
your oxen etc you know he's rewriting it to say that's actually about us and me
what is how does Paula Fredrickson's work like where do you say I agree I agree I agree I like
this and then where do you split off in disagreement okay that also is a good question well I think
that where I agree is on the the very basic point that Paul was a Jew and he remained a Jew all
through and this is enormously important this is something that we had to get into our minds as it
were and and and never forget because tradition has taught us that Paul was well a Christian
first of all and then perhaps even the founder of Christianity or whatnot but but but but this this
will not work we have we have come to see that and and it is enormously important there's a
long scholarly development here that has led to this which we need not go into here but one could
say that the position that Paula Fredrickson is representing is as you were the the newest
position within that development towards stressing Paul's Jewishness they call themselves Paul
within Judaism I think that is very unhelpful because the position that that I'm going to
delineate to you in a moment also sees Paul as within Judaism but but there are some important
differences that I want to insist on so so I think perhaps this is a little too imperialistic to say
that they alone as it were have Paul within Judaism in Denmark we actually speak of of them as or
this trend as the radical Paul basing itself on something they themselves said but that's just
a parenthesis in a way I'm going to argue here for a Paul within Judaism that also has some distinct
characteristics about it and this is where the disagreement comes in it is true and that is
strongly emphasized by the radical Paulness that Paul addresses himself only to non-Jews
his whole agenda is relevant only well is relevant is addressed to non-Jews but
the question then is is this only relevant what he is saying to non-Jews is that only relevant
to non-Jews and not also to Jews and this is perhaps where we part our ways as it were because I think
that whatever he says about the importance of the Christ event the the arrival of the Messiah
the reception of the Pneuma etc is also relevant for Jews in the sense that they too
should believe that the Messiah has arrived in Jesus Christ and they too should receive the
Pneuma and Paul Fredrickson fortunately agrees that that that the Pneuma is also relevant to Jews
but but if you do that then it seems to me that
we are very close to a kind of agreement where Paul is articulating what I would call a new
Judaism it is Judaism it is it remains Jewish etc but is a new Judaism
where the question of whether one is a Jew in the traditional ethnic sense becomes of less
importance because there is one thing that ties Christ believing non-Jews and Christ believing
Jews together and that is what receiving the Pneuma acting it out in the communities here
here and now and eventually being saved at through the resurrection these central things
are I believe shared by Christ believing non-Jews and Christ believing Jews on Paul's view
that I think is what what chapters 9 to 11 of Romans is about that unfortunately not all Jews
have accepted this new message but Paul is certain that eventually they will so he does
have some pretty heavy language in Romans 9 when he talks about the hardening of hearts that's
come upon using that hardening of hearts on Jews and that some vessels are prepared for destruction
it's kind of a it's really harsh language and of course he cries at the beginning of that chapter
like well I wish I could become a curse for my people and then on and on but I did want to
mention in Romans if we if we could just one thing she said in her book that I'd love to
get your thoughts on she says Paul's writing this to non-Jews a Gentile audience and that Paul is
trying to downplay the Torah she thinks that Paul doesn't really think negatively of the Torah
but then Paul is downplaying it and making it sound bad for the Jewish or for the non-Jewish
audience so kind of like she thinks that he's trying to psychologically get away from it don't
follow it but right this considered the heart of what you're describing here as a new form of
within Judaism yeah and that is does Paul really think that for only non-Jews but think it positive
for Jews or does Paul really think toward the law right what he's saying here it's hard for me to
know right but but now you mentioned Romans Romans chapters one to three are central here
because you're you're right I think it's it's quite clear that he wants to downplay the importance of
the law for non-Jews but in that passage he as I read it certainly also says that there is a problem
with fulfilling the law for Jews too otherwise those three chapters really don't make any sense
and and and that means that this is as it were the situation as it is now or was before the arrival
of Christ and the arrival of Christ the Christ event then was meant by God to bring that
impossible situation to an end so that both non-Jews who had all these problems with with
Essex etc and also Jews who also had some problems may now eventually fulfill the law and be
be saved so I think the the the whole way of set the setup in Romans is of this kind
and I really cannot make sense of Romans as a whole unless one posits that it is also the Christ
event is also thought by Paul to be relevant to Jews but there are so many things with which I
agree in in Paul afraid for instance he speaks in chapter 11 of God's Israel and people have
traditionally taken it that this meant just you know Christ believing either non-Jews or Jews
that is Christians but I think that's wrong God's Israel is God's Jewish Israel but but but but that
doesn't change the fact that he he does want to say that there is a basic similarity between
Christ believing non-Jews and Christ believing Jews which is that through their faith relationship
to God their reception of the Pneuma etc all these wonderful things that we've been talking about
will happen to them all too that I cannot simply cannot get away from that however much but I
must say also I learn I usually say that I have learned most from Jewish scholars throughout my
career and for good reasons because they say something that we don't know as it were beforehand
so I if I want to understand Paul better then that is very helpful and my conversations with
Paul of Frederickson are enormously helpful to me at least yeah I wonder if this Christ program
this is why I was saying a lot of the older models within critical scholarship of Paul
they think that Paul's actually going against the Torah the letter of the law if you will
they go so far as to say he's doing something so new and different he's against what the Jewishness
if you will love the Torah even though he says he's a Jew the question I have is if he if he's
demanding that Jews are also to play a part of this new this Pneuma program of Christ
um what does he think about them so he's telling non-Jews don't you don't need to do this in fact
tell us people were telling you to do this Galatians cut the whole thing off so yeah
does is he expecting Jews to stop continuing in that letter of the law practice rather than
just being good people moral people and I say that to say because in Acts it sounds like I think
acts as a an apologist a very smart author here who's harmonizing Paul and they want to try and
deal with this problem I think by saying hey Paul we heard that you were telling Jews not to do this
thing where did that rumor come from did Paul actually tell Jews this no it's a serious question
it's a serious question a very good question and I also happen to believe that was a very good
answer to it namely that he's not saying to his fellow Jews that they should
start practicing the law but he is saying something different namely that whether they
practice the Mersaik law as they are free to do and that that's part of what it is to be a Jew
in a traditional ethnic sense or whether as a non-Jew you don't practice the law in that sense
is and here it comes indifferent the Stelig said at the airport run it doesn't really matter for the
one thing that really matters which is a Christ-faced Pneuma resurrection etc it's it's it's sort of at
a lower level whether you do one thing that is whether you are a Jew in a traditional sense
or whether you whether you are not there's something else that is the important thing
and and that that is that that means that Paul has not turned his back in any way to his traditional
Judaism and his whole message is a Jewish one too but but it also means that by distinguishing
between what really matters the only thing that matters and all the rest he has opened up
inadvertently he didn't want to open up for some people saying okay we can forget about
the Jews it doesn't really matter we have the the only thing that really matters and is the
Christ of end etc that is something that non-Jews who could say when they eventually
became more and more as we know they did after Paul more and more Christ believers were non-Jews
so they could say away well we don't want this Judaism whatever we have the essential thing
so my picture is that Paul is placing himself on a razor's edge where he belongs on the one
side with the Jews but other people might understand him later on as turning his back to
Judaism I think that that image helps us to understand the actual historical development
namely that eventually Christians as we may then call them turned their backs on on Judaism
Paul didn't want that and in fact I think that in Romans 9 to 11 he had as it were already foreseen
the risk that this might happen which is why he's so much insist that Christ belief etc it's a Jewish
matter the roots are Jewish and they must never forget that forget that he also says that remember
that when God cut off some branches from the olive tree and put others in namely the non-Jews
hey he may also go on to cut them off if they don't understand the situation correctly so he
is really threatening threatening his non-Jewish adversaries in Romans I can see how replacement
theology would have reinterpreted Paul out the gate because two factors I see that are coming
in here exactly what you're describing about the look I've got to keep a program for these Jews
as a thing because well has God he says over and over in Romans like has God forgotten his promises
God forbid like he hasn't so but then what really gets me interested is this apocalypticism so
if the program is supposed to happen soon and it doesn't happen but we're left to our own devices
we have to figure out a way that the program keeps going and so instead kind of a cognitive
distance in a way kind of resets oh what Paul meant is this new kingdom that's here and and it's
yeah you got it and that is one point where it's so important to remember the apocalyptic
character of Paul he was only thinking for the next few weeks as far as he knew
and and and that makes enormously an enormous difference in his in in in the whole situation
in which he is thinking so but you put it very well yourself I love this and I almost want to
I wanted to get on Paul and this book I hope everybody gets it by the way Paul on identity
I really it's fun I'm not I'm not just saying that like I you're writing style is very good
and for those who've not like read their bible like deeply they just read scholarship you're
gonna get Paul and the scholarship in this because he quotes Paul and sometimes you do tweaks of your
own like you take the nrsv but then you do a little tweak of your own little interpretation
and I love the way that you have written this style so that we can get a better understanding
of Paul but then hear it in layman's terms to understand okay right we're going deep and so
I would love to follow Paul and how his identity goes into the gospels but then they change his
identity over time in a weird way like they start to so Paul is like a very important person in
Mark our earliest gospel but then I don't know if you have something to say on that that would be
wonderful to hear you oh yes in fact I have because I've been working on first the gospel of Mark and
John then in the book you mentioned John and philosophy primarily in the first place as
those texts themselves that that is really what we must do we we cannot bring everything in at first
we must form an opinion on how does it hang together as a whole this particular writing but then I've
also thought and asked myself when as part in a way of that piece of interpretation
is there is a ah yes here yeah it looks as if they have actually read Paul and they have
transformed it in this and that way and and I I think that again it's not so
fantastically important to say whether they actually had read Paul and transformed it etc
but but I do think that one understands perhaps again better both what Mark is doing in chapter eight
and what what John is doing in in chapter 15 etc etc if one take it yeah well they may actually
have been reading Paul and they have understood his basic message in but then transformed it
in in in their own context because of course their context is entirely different they are
talking about Jesus and Paul of course is not talking about Jesus but about what it means
to the congregation once Jesus has died and has risen etc etc and they are living in this
short interim period I'd like to ask a few more questions as we wrap up this wonderful episode
Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 he died he was buried and then he rose again or if you will
a probable better term in the Greek would be the apotheosis concept he's taken up in his sense
in what way does stoicism play a part in that and then do you see
Mark creating the narrative of this empty tomb and the women at the tomb is this more
in your opinion more of a fiction of creating more narration about this of what Paul says
just very briefly in 1 Corinthians 15 well how do you see that connection
the first answer is that I think that stoicism is only relevant in connection with 1 Corinthians 15
to the understanding of the resurrection body that we talked about the the soma pneumaticon
apart from that I'm not really I don't think that stoicism is is particularly helpful in
understanding anything in 1 Corinthians 15 then on to Mark 16 I think it is extremely important
to understand that Mark very clearly says that what he has been describing is Jesus of Nazareth
that is the the human Jesus and what comes after that
everybody knows what comes after that and and Mark definitely knows it because he has already
described it sort of prefigured it in chapters 9 where Jesus is seen on the mountain with
with Moses and Isaiah so Mark is quite clear that Jesus is not just Jesus the human being
but in fact the resurrected Christ but he doesn't want to bring that out and that is why we have
just the empty tomb and the angel saying that he is elsewhere you are looking for Jesus of
Nazareth this is a human he is not here that is a clear clear emphasis from by Mark that
this is what his written theme was Jesus of Nazareth then we have to in a way provide all
the the rest of the story that that one could of course read in Paul etc etc but
but but that is not his his his agenda and and it I think it's very very important that this is
the earliest gospel and he wanted and he probably created the gospel he wanted it to have that specific
character that the the the divine resurrected christlike character of Jesus was certainly
known to the reader but was not spelled out in in any way and this is very different than from what
John does because there he Jesus walks around constantly saying all these things about himself
I and the father are one etc nobody understands it I personally believe that the gospel of Mark
and John are very closely connected John had read Mark and and then done interesting things to it
but there is a clear difference between between Mark's idea and John's idea I don't think you
can tie any of that any of that specifically to Paul where where you find similarities between
first John and Paul and Mark and Paul is in in what we could call the anthropology and
ethics where where it is all about what believing in that christ figure means to the human being
also exactly there you in those passages have referred to Mark 8 and and John 15 you can you
you can see some interesting similarities this what that's why I brought up the scholar you
brought up in your book um William Reed as he talks about this prefiguring you know I love that about
this you know exactly what I'm talking about I love it um I love that and I wanted to bring
up Paul just to get what you thought Paul meant in what's going on here do you think Paul meant
Jesus was like obviously says he was crucified he's obviously buried we we go to the gospels quickly
in our minds because Paul doesn't give us anything there and it's like what does he mean buried in
a tomb does he give it right right right but first coincidence 15 years as you said about
the resurrection of christ in the first half of the chapter and they this is something people
have seen him etc etc and if you don't believe that you don't believe in anything in in this
hurry area but that's only the first part then the second part of course is but but how can we
imagine a human being being resurrected that's something that the the correction had been
asking about and then he goes into all this material ending up with the pneumatic body
we could put two and two together here and say well if we ask how Jesus was resurrected
the obvious answer is that he was resurrected in the same way by the Pneuma that as it was
operating on his physical body and transformed it transformation is enormously important here
transformed it into a pneumatic body and as such he is now present in heaven with God etc etc
it would be fair to say there's a missing body then right if that's why you would say
mark is kind of there's continuity in mark saying his body's no more it's not here
it's transformed that's right that's right the only thing is that we are now enter the area of
speculation because Paul does not in first Corinthians 15 himself makes the step from
what we might want to say about the resurrection of human beings in general
and what happened to Jesus he doesn't do that so if we do it we are on slippery ground and if we
then take this additional draw this additional conclusion that this fits in with the empty
tomb then okay you could say that but it's not in mark either so we must we must really try not to
put ideas into the text we are reading in order to make the whole thing
coherent we have to at at certain points we have to say we just don't know we are not told and if
we are not told and we cannot form a decent guess about it we have better say that we don't know
right and this i'm about to ask you the final hot question and and it's kind of something i
pieced together in an article i wrote where i said i called it the minimal doubts argument
and it's because there's there are apologists out there that call the minimal facts argument they
want to like try and tell everyone why they're damned if they don't believe that kind of stuff and
i'm like oh so i combat some of this stuff and i write articles and i think that it at best people
have faith for a reason that it's faith it's not fact it's not here is absolute proof it's it's
a belief system but um i think that and then tell me where you stand on this i'm just going to
paint my picture and then you tell me what your picture looks like i think there was a split
i think that paul had a split from the jerusalem church i think ax is trying to harmonize them
and bring them together but really there was a break off i don't think paul and the other guys
saw eye to eye i may disagree with paula frederickson in galatians i think that when he's giving the
example of i stood and told peter to his face i think this is evidence of real problems that paul
and the jerusalem church had and then i think james is sending spies to spy out paul i am i'm
convinced that this makes more sense even though we can't be dogmatic and we can't say i'm certain
i think that this makes the most sense then when i read mark i called them the dim-witted disciples
they they never get it they just and we're talking about the jerusalem disciples these are the it's
constantly dogging the 12 they never get it and it's kind of uh smashing them a little bit that's
why i see matthew makes them good-looking mark downplays them and at the end the 12 or supposedly
the direct followers of jesus they don't get it and then it says the the man in the tomb and the
linen says go um tell the others that to meet in galately like we said and the women went and
told no one for they were afraid so the way i see it is this is a way of saying in my opinion and it's
guessing that paul is constantly having to say that i am the greatest apostle in fact
more than the others and at the end of that list in first quintessu fifteen he says listen i know
i'm the least and i'm the last but i work harder than all of them and it seems like yeah there's
always a problem going on between these guys so when i read mark and maybe it's my intuition
and little clues that make me take this conclusion i think that mark is saying they didn't get the
message right they didn't get the full revelation paul probably did i don't know i mean i'm guessing
but but but here i think we have to say the following um you are trying to sort of reconstruct
historical situation behind the text right but one could say that the text makes sense this
not understanding misunderstanding of the disciples makes sense on its own and that is and if it does
make sense on its own then there's no um text intrinsic urge to move outside the text and to
make this a historical reconstruction and in that case i think okay then we had better stay
with the text internal meaning now i'm i'm presupposing here that there is a text internal
meaning which is that that it is in fact uh well difficult to understand about uh jesus
all the things that mark also claims about him but even but only indirectly in those passages
i referred to it is a difficult thing to have that kind of christ face with the precise content that
jesus born as paul says at a specific time etc etc was also the messiah in the sense that the whole
physical machinery of the pneuma etc etc and god's intervention will him etc that that all of that
took place that that that is not so easy to understand and that is something then that
mark in a way wants to to celebrate so that you have the kind of opposition between what is
what is so difficult to understand that they don't get it etc at the same time of course as
mark also has it that the demons who belong at that level they they know who he is so you have you
have this kind of tension between what human beings can understand and it seems to me to make
excellent sense and to make good enough sense not to move move move outside the text and try to
i think the only thing i have going for me is that mark is very pauline and because it's very
pauline that's about the best i have going for me i'm just guessing but but you're right i i'm
that's why i said i'm not that automatic i think there could be something to this whole i'm all
against guesswork in biblical studies i think that that is that is the reason why one can as it were
constantly produce one i one theory and one theory and one theory and much of that is guesswork
and i i uphold it of course people can say that what i'm trying to do is guesswork too
that i i do believe and i do hope that and these will be my final words that
my suggestions for reading paul can be as it were validated by a shared sitting down and
reading the text and talking about what it aims to say and that is that is where i also
disagree with dale martin we began that there is such a saying as solid historical
work on these texts and and for that for the same reason i i i really don't want to enter
into speculation it's better to say that we just don't know of course we human beings are put together
in such a way that we would like to have the answers but it but but it is science and i think
scholarship to say that even if we want to have the answers when we cannot we shouldn't try to
postulate something what in that final thing is part of this is do you think there was a split
or a problem at least between paul and the other apostles when he talks about super apostles when
he starts or do you think it could be anybody i mean we don't know that there is super apostles in
first Corinthians were directly connected with or with peter or anybody else again we cannot know
so so i i i don't want to speculate about that at all i think i can make excellent
sense of second Corinthians in in those passages without knowing precisely who they were or without
knowing precisely what kind of other things they you know focused on in their understanding
of the of the christ event it's it's so much a matter of trying to speculate behind etc etc
