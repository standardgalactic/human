Predictable world events. Now, we've been discussing on this show a lot about prophecy.
I guess you could call me more of a naturalist in many ways. At the same time, there are some
interesting things that this guest is going to bring. Keith Hunter, he's going to take us into
a lot of interesting astrological things. Astrological. There are some celestial bodies he
believes when they are lined up at certain times in history, people in this world act
certain ways. It's really weird. He goes into the Bible showing numbers and how they are
significant to these astrological signs. He does a little mythology, but he'll take you through
this PowerPoint presentation. I hope you enjoy. I hope you like it and stay to the end because
we have a real heartfelt discussion at the end and it gets pretty deep. Let us know what you
think. Don't forget to subscribe to the channel. Make sure you like and comment down below. And
if this is your cup of tea, you know I'm always going to bring something else. Love you guys.
We are MythVision. Welcome back, everybody. Your host, Derek Lambert. I have a special guest,
a new treat, somebody you've never met before. And if you have, hey, my hat is off to you. It is
Keith Hunter, I believe, correct? Yes. Yes, sir. If you don't mind, Keith, you wrote me an awesome
email where I'm into stuff like this. I love researching ideas. I'm a fan of catastrophist
concepts. Randall Carlson, you know, you've got the Graham Hancox and gentlemen like that who are
trying to kind of figure it out. And Robert Shock and these catastrophists were like, you know,
trying to explain what happened to the Ice Age. And you said something that was esoteric as well
as a catastrophist concept, which I said, we got to do a show. If you don't mind introducing who
you are, because I don't even know really who you are. Yeah, I don't really publicize myself too much.
I must admit, I only occasionally go on various programs. I should do more, but I tend to just
do a lot of research privately. And it's so niche that not many people seem to,
they either get it or they don't, because what I try to provide with my research is highly advanced
esoteric solutions in certain critical areas. So my work over the past 20 years or so has been
looking at various different things. I have looked at from the basis of astronomy, I was very
interested in this idea, the earth once had 360 days per year. And the solar system was in the
state of great harmony. And so I looked into that. And, you know, and I basically did a breakthrough in
certain mathematical physical laws, which allowed you to confirm that the earth did indeed once
have 360 days per year, and the moon had 30 days a month. And it's all in line with say the ancient
Egyptian calendar system, right? So that view of the ancients was correct. And I also looked at
megalithic structures like the Great Pyramid and Stonehenge. And I was interested in like, you know,
the whole idea of an earth grid system, that there was something special about the global
location of these structures. And so I looked into that. And again, I used a true earth ellipsoid
model and was able to find certain brilliantly accurate mathematical connections with the gas
and placement of the Great Pyramid and Stonehenge and even the Pyramids on Mars. And this was an
advance on a lot of other people, because most people out there, they just use degrees, minutes
and seconds as angular measures over a spheroid earth. I'm using a true earth ellipsoid model. So
that was an advancement there. And I also looked at certain military bases, and they seem to be
located at certain locations, which are just like with the same considerations as the megalithic
structures. And so that actually comprises that that took me a long time to read, read upon and
make the breakthroughs. And that's all in my book called Physics. And this is split up into two
parts. And the first one deals with the astronomical alignments and so forth. And some of the laws of
proportion and how the earth form was actually altered. But I also, in the second part of the
book, start to look into some of the advanced stuff to do with the placement of megalithic
monuments, like the Great Pyramid being at the corner point of a cube within the earth,
and the grid matrix that is actually connecting up all the lines, the great circle arcs to it,
and certain critical ratios of certain components. And it's very high level stuff,
because not only that, I show the same kind of diagrams relate to some of these sophisticated
facilities like Men with Hill and the Pine Gap, these US bases, the only NSA stuff.
So there's a real revival of occult technology, if you will. They are looking at reviving the
technology that was the basis of some of these strange megalithic monuments. And even tightening
to nuclear bombs, which appear to be activated with regard to where the sun is in the sky,
you know, I did a major presentation on my YouTube channel talking about that thing. So
that's the kind of stuff I looked into in the early part as well. But I've always been interested in
astronomy. And I've always been interested in the Bible as well. And the Mayan calendar, I was one
of these guys that was obsessed about the whole 2012 thing, you know, I get it, I get it. And I
blame you. And by the way, our audience, the YouTube channel will be down in the description.
If you guys are interested in your interest is peaked here, make sure you go over there and
check them out and subscribe to his channel. And I also have the Amazon affiliate link that I have
down below. I'm gonna, is it on Amazon, your book? And no, I just sell it directly via my website.
Okay, I don't have a deal with Amazon. Okay, so just go to the website, then we'll put that down
there too. So awesome. I was, as I said, I was really interested in the, the whole 2012 thing.
And, you know, I bought lots of books on it. I mean, for example, as John Major Jenkins 2012,
you know, he thought it was all, it was all gonna end there. There's a, here we go, another one.
2012, at the end of the world, that one there. And there was also,
but one of the first books I bought, actually, was this one here.
And I always liked this book here. Most of the stuff in this book, in terms of what he says about
the, the mathematics of the mind calendar, unfortunately, he's completely wrong. But
what he does, he cites certain critical passages from some of the scholars who went to visit.
You know, when we went to the New World in the, like, initially in the 16th century, just
into that decade. And he asked, before we'd like totally burned everybody's books, you know,
all destroyed that the Aztecs culture and the mind culture, you know,
some of it was written down and we got the mechanics of the calendar systems. And so
I, I must admit, for 20 years, I had nothing. I was still thinking this calendar was tied into
2012. And in no way was it. But I made it an absolute critical breakthrough and solve the
entire calendar system. There is a special conjunction pattern, which I'm going to mention
as part of his presentation, which is what the long count was designed to target along with
the calendar round, the Aztec system. They were both used in conjunction. And you will find also
that even in the Bible and in Greek mythology, they all seem to have created various mythological
stories with their own local gods and heroes, their own pantheons, but they were all pointing to
the same conjunction patterns. So for example, the destruction of the army of Sennacherib in the
Bible, which is mentioned in the book of Isaiah, that particular story is encoded in Greek mythology
as the death of Phaethon with the thunderbolt from Zeus. Okay. And so what I'm going to show you is
it's a bit technical, but I've got a very, very well laid out slide show presentation.
I have several, in fact. You know, one was the mega one that was four hours long. But
this one here is a kind of combination looking at some of the key dates of disaster. I mean,
I'm going to solve the great mystery for people who are wondering about the day of the Exodus,
for example. And this is why you've really got to think about what kind of research focus you need.
A lot of people are trying to solve Exodus. Some people think, obviously, it's complete myth
and never happened, you know, which is not true. It did happen. It was a real disaster. All these
so-called plagues, you know, dust covering the land, obscuring the sun, the Nile going red,
you know, locusts and all that. There were real plagues and lots of people died. It was a real event.
But then everybody's trying to figure it out. And this is where you've got to think what is going
to lead you to the decisive breakthrough. A lot of people are going into archaeology.
That will get you so far. But these great disasters we have are triggered abruptly,
suddenly, when very special alignments are achieved. And because of this, if you can figure
out the alignments, you can look at the precise date of these disasters. And this is what I
managed to do. I figured out the precise date of Noah's flood, of the Exodus alignment,
of crucifixion day. And there's a few people out there have already got crucifixion day correct.
It's just that they don't know why it's correct, if you know what I'm saying. There's people not
seen some of the connections. And I've got some of these disaster dates. But once I figured what
these precise dates were based on the alignments, I then realized how they were tied together by
calendar cycles, like the Mayan lung count system, 144,000 days and whatever, and 360 day cycles.
And sometimes it's slight adjustments, because you're trying to harmonize two disasters. You've
got one disaster here, you might have another disaster occurs, a thousand or so years in advance,
you know, separating them. And you might have a 360 day calendar, it might not harmonize perfectly.
So you might have to have a little special adjustment to a certain number of days, and then
you set in motion the calendar, and you're achieving harmonization with a certain special
numbers of cycles completed. And this is the kind of information which is encoded in the Bible,
in the parables of Jesus. You know, what Jesus does, the stories of the main Gospels, Matthew,
Matt, Luke and John, they are effectively, it's a fictional public life story of Jesus, which
encodes calendar cycles, which target future disaster alignments, not just the crucifixion
which was itself an end of age alignment, but also at least three alignments in the sixth century AD,
which caused the dark ages to begin. And a few other alignments, several centuries in advance of
that. So Jesus actually basically targets multiple alignments, you know, so a lot of people think
that, like with Revelation, they think, you know, there's this one great event going to happen.
Well, they don't realize is we have these end of age alignments, if you will. We have one on average
every several hundred years, not thousands of years, every several hundred. It's just that some
of the effects are kind of mild, and they're not massively destructive. You know, we've had a bit
of a low point, but that's what I wanted to get into. So I was actually long time ago, I just
wanted to mention this, big fan of Randall Carlson, like I mentioned, and I actually contacted him
and I said, you know, Randall brought up some patterns and he went into these things showing
that the Egyptian pyramid and stuff has numerical significance. They understood things that we
don't, we take for granted, you know, we don't really realize how intelligent these people were
who helped build these structures. And I'm not saying ancient aliens, okay? I'm not saying that,
okay? I'm not, we're not trying tin foil hat, like don't throw stones at us. But I have had this,
you know, I want my audience to understand, I have had this, I'm a skeptic, okay? I'm a very
skeptical guy, like even what you're going to present today, I'm going to take it with a grain
of salt. I'm going to hopefully try and glean from it what I can accept right now and try to work
on it. And I hope they do the same, because when I looked at the biblical narratives and other
mythologies, I found numerical patterns. I saw repetitive numerological significances. And to
me, and I hear this all the time, dude, they're just numbers. They just throw, they're just numbers.
And I'm going, but the dimensions of the New Jerusalem and the dimensions of the cube and
the Epic of Gilgamesh, if you do the square of the, this is all furlongs and talking about,
there's these mathematical numbers, 72. And, you know, these numbers that kept coming up and I go,
why are there 72 Buddhas in Indonesia as statues in the temple? Why did Jesus send forth 72?
Why did Moses send forth 72? Why is these numbers there? And, you know, one might just go, well,
they just had a fascination with numbers, but these numbers go back to time and time goes back
to calendar. And how are they going to survive unless they can tell time? And I think it's more
than just agricultural. They might have had some type of tradition and able to see maybe what you're
going to get into a little bit here today. That's why I am open-minded to what you're going to present.
I, I myself, as I said, I go for advanced solutions and I have seen a lot of researchers out there
and I don't want to be disparaging to them, but they, a lot of them have certain superficial
connections and they present numbers, but they don't give you the decisive breakthrough. You know
what I mean? You just mentioned about why did Jesus send forth 72 messengers. You're referring to Luke
9 and 10 and I know the exact solution to that and I will tell you straight out right now.
The messengers go in pairs, right? Let's suppose, and I have a slide show, this is the very lengthy
presentation. I'm not going to get into this, but I'll just tell you straight out. As you ask, as you
ask the pairs, who are the messengers that Jesus sends out? Why are there 72? Why are they going
pairs? The correct answer is the messengers are Mars and Venus. If you have Mars and Venus in
alignment, the Sun, Venus and Mars all lined up 12 noon, how many days does it take for them to
reconjunct? And the answer is about 300 and I think it's 332 days or so and basically they basically
go forwards or rather anticlockwise 175 degrees when they reconjunct again. So how many conjunctions
does it take for them to go all the way back to 12 noon and the answer is 72? Okay and there's a
reference in another, I think it's the Gospel of Matthew, when Jesus is asked about forgiveness
and he says something like, how many times are you supposed to forgive people? 70 times 7. This is
a tie-in to Mercury and it's also a tie-in to the 72 messengers, firstly two ascent on their
own and then the rest, the other 70 and there's a reason why 70 is sent first because that ties
into the earth, but that specific story is all about the most important destructive alignment
that we have, a recurring alignment and it's the alignment of Mars, Venus, the Sun and Mercury
in that order, targeting close to the galactic centre, whilst simultaneously the Sun, the Earth
and the Pleiades star group are in alignment. That is the critical alignment that the Mayan
lung count was used to target and it's also the same one mentioned in Luke 9 and 10 and
you see Jesus in that very story 9 and 10, he says to his servants when they return, he says to them
you know, did you see, I give you the power to tread on scorpions and serpents, nothing will hurt
you, your names are written in heaven. If you look to the galactic centre area and you're where Mars
and Venus and you're looking down at alignment, the alignment is targeting the midpoint between
the sting of the scorpion's tail, shawla and zeus appendis, the lowest star of the serpent's tail
constellation, that's where the Sun is when the alignment goes and you know, two of his messages
initially say to them when they're rejected, shall we rain down fire upon them and Jesus says no no,
why, why no? Well because they're in the wrong houses, you know, he says go and knock on all
these houses, tell them I'm coming, he's not talking about houses on earth, he's talking about houses
of the zodiac, and the alignment is in the right part of the sky, then we rain down fire
and the critical date for that is the, well he gives two but there's the 4th of November, 1345
and we've even got a reference in Klub and Napier, I'm going to get into but anyway, let me,
I don't want to stop you but I just want to say that same, I can't take this literal man and this
is why I have a hard time but I take it in a esoteric sense, I think this star mythology and
some interesting stuff like you're talking about esoterically and allegory and stuff but it is
literally something other than what, and maybe we can internalize these things but what I was
going to say is Elijah does the same thing, so this is why we have patterns and I love this so
I almost want to call this like patterns, some title to do with patterns brother but thank you
so much, I'm ready, I'm ready, all right let's get the presentation and the screen share then,
how this one here to begin,
right, do you see my screen, you see this first slide here, it says special conjunction patterns,
yep, I don't think I hear you, oh yeah okay, yeah okay, yeah I'm just on mute, I don't want any
disruptions, oh I see yeah, so okay then, so what I'm going to basically do here, I just give you
a bit of a summary, as I said I've got very lengthy presentations but I'm just going to try and summarize
the analysis here, so basically we have these ideas of world ages and when we have certain
special alignments that occur they cause the solar system to go into a kind of resonant agitation,
in the bible in the Nakamari text it talks about the celestial spheres cancel their circuits and
the celestial powers are shaken, okay, so when we get alignments we can have all kinds of exotic
things occur, we can have geophysical effects which is the first thing here mentioned and this
is can be caused by the simultaneous resonant agitation of all the celestial bodies in the
solar system, so it's not just the earth right, you can also have the other bodies itself agitated,
so you can have height and seismic activity even planet wide and you can have a temporary
disruption to the axial rotation speed of the earth itself, so this is where you get people
talking about the sun slowing down in the sky, the certain Greek mythological stories about that
and it just it's only a temporary thing, it speeds back up to it's you know 24-hour
rotation period but there are disruptions like this, a lot of the disruptions that occur
unless they cross certain critical thresholds we haven't gone past a fundamental change, it
returns to the way it was, so we can have that effect there, then we can have the planets can
develop cometary properties, planets themselves like Venus or Mercury, they can ignite to develop
cometary properties, long tails and the earth itself might get caught up in some of the so the
cometary debris from Venus because when you have a conjunction you know say between Venus and the
earth, if Venus has got a long tail stretching tens of millions of miles away and that's absolutely
kind of standard, you can have that you know in astronomy even the very small comets but
comets always point away from the sun, so the earth can cross through Venus's cometary stream
and we appear to have had that in the past as well, so this is why when we get a lot of these
disaster stories, they talk about comets being seen in the sky but they're not always small
little comets, they're actually the planets that have become comets and develop cometary properties,
you can also have blasted off, I know this might sound very strange, but you can also have blasted
off into space material debris from the planets, they don't just develop cometary tails with small
like halos and dust and whatever, you see we've got small comets that we've seen blasting off
material you know from certain close studies of them and imagine everything scaled up, so instead
of a small comet blasting off significant sized chunks you can get a planet like Venus blasting
off material as well as long cometary tails, so this is where we get these meteor bombardments
from and this is what happened in 10,964 BC or whatever you know with the disaster alignment
there, we can then get and the third thing in this we can get changes to the sun itself,
it can change its colour, the light waves can develop coherency and via destructive interference
cancel one another out, so you've heard about days of darkness, it's not you to just an eclipse,
the sun itself literally is light waves can reflect back into themselves and the sun itself
temporarily as a visible emitter of light seems to just shut down, it's gone outside of our normal
spectrum, this is where we get the references in esoteric literature to the dragon of the outer
darkness with its tail in its mouth it's swallowing its own light waves so to speak, so these are the
kinds of things that you get when you get certain special patterns okay and this is what I'm going
to get into, events like Exodus, Noah's Flood, Crucifixion Day, they occurred when we had certain
special configurations which triggered some of these effects here, so I'm going to show you
precise screenshots, precise times of some of these alignments and tie them together with some esoteric
calendar cycles, so the analysis then if I go to this one here I'm going to use the Starry Night
program which is a really good program to use and for all your people out there to be able to check
my data I'm going to give you precise dates and not only calendar dates as you can see on the left
here but the Julian Day numbers as well, you can see those here, every if you're into astronomy
software, when you've got your normal calendar dates you can also have them, they have an absolute
day number, a Julian Day number and I'm going to be adding or subtracting one Julian Day number from
another between calendar dates so that we're dealing with high precision, we're not caught out with
leap years or anything like that but it'll be showing Julian Day numbers alongside their calendar
dates so if you're interested in astronomy software you'll be able to do that, so let's begin with the
first event, the Exodus event, a very real event, some people think it occurred around about the
the mid 13th century, that's actually quite wrong, the people that favour mid 15th century BC
they are correct okay, so let's see if we can just target it, well it's associated with some
sort of disaster alignment and comets are a part of that, so here's an article, I just want to show
you on screen, this is from the ancient origins website and somebody was talking all about a
comet, so this is a little quotation, it states here, a comet was recorded by the Egyptians in the
22nd year of the reign of the pharaoh Tutmosis III who described it as a brilliant disk much
large than the full moon, adding that it was a marvel never before known since the foundation
of this land and Chinese astronomers you know recorded it, all really amazing, now this talks
about it then being in the 22nd year of pharaoh Tutmosis III, well let's look in Wikipedia at
Tutmosis III, Wikipedia saves us, the orthodox Egyptologists here, they've got this guy's day
nailed, I mean seriously this is it, his reign is usually dates it says from 24th of April 1479 BC
so 11th of March 1425 but here's the interesting thing, there's no mention of a comet but it goes
on to say from the age of two until his death at age 56, okay so it says however during the first
22 years of his reign he was co-regent, now the very fact that we've got this comet cited
22 years into his reign and he's co-regent for 22 years, very interesting, but all we need is the
date here 1479, all we need to do is go forwards 22 years and we get to 1457 BC, this is the year of
Exodus, okay it was triggered by a planetary alignment so all I did was go into starry night,
top down view of the solar system, plugged in 1457 BC first of January, hit the play button
and watch the planets do their dance and you're watching and you're watching and you're watching
until suddenly an exceptional alignment just comes out of nowhere and you hit this pause button,
the alignment in question is this one, four-body direct alignment between Mars, the earth,
Mercury and Venus on the 28th of March 1457 BC, okay this alignment was the destructive
alignment that triggered cometary properties, I would imagine between Venus and Mercury
and this is what they were looking at, okay so but just to give you another interesting point here,
we know in esoteric literature the player days is a very important star grouping and the reason
for it is you usually get alignments, a lot of these alignments, you see there are certain
dangerous directions in the sky and when you get alignments in these directions that's you know
so I mean you can get four-body alignments you know kind of not too they're not too irregular
but getting them at certain points, targeting certain past the sky is a lot more rare,
if we position ourselves at the center of Mars and look all the way down the line
of this alignment and it's optimum right here to the day, here is what we see,
it's lined up brilliantly with the player days barely half a degree or so, okay,
Noah's flood involved a very special configuration which was also tied in to the player days by the
way but that's another presentation, Noah's flood did occur in 2348 on the 27th of September
but I didn't want to get into that one since otherwise we'd not have enough time so here we've
got the alignments, real quick question pertaining to that because when we for example like Noah's
flood happening on those days I know you didn't want to get into it we get a lot of material you
got to cover here but I do want to ask when it comes to stuff like that when you're dating this
are you using like more than just the biblical narrative to try and find an actual event that
occurred and not just saying well the Bible says and then I'm just going with what the Bible itself
saying but I'm actually trying to find like outside resources to suggest something happened
during that time kind of like you know because a lot of people say is this a global flood is it
an earthly flood a local flood I know some people think it's a celestial flood too so as above so
below concepts so anyway I just I just didn't want to sidetrack but for our audience most of
the people who watch my channel are skeptical and they don't take like the Bible at its word
necessarily so that'll be something to keep in mind as we go you know further yet the work I did on
Noah's flood there there is a lot you see I look at physical evidence and in one of the slides I'm
going to be showing in particular is going to summarize it we have physical evidence of disasters
okay and not just sighting sometimes we have sightings and in some of these cases I'm talking
about direct witness type sightings of comets in the sky we also have tree ring data pointing to
disasters ones in 536 AD for example we have the massive plague from a comet 1345 Noah's flood
there's a series of data pointing towards geological instability again it's in the physical record
circa 2350 BC there's a few citations from articles I've seen there we also have for 30
there's another you know the alignment I was referring to with the plateies
just with Luke 9 and 10 that alignment there so the the main calendar that was 3153 BC is the
precise calendar date of the alignment 3150 BC we were evidencing the magnetic field destruction
of the geomagnetic spike which is associated with cometary impacts that's for the work of
Professor Ionis Laritzis I believe so I do look at the physical evidence to try to get ballpark
times and then I look to see if there's some kind of special alignments going off there and I try
to figure out the calendar systems so I try to tie together the physical evidence of disaster
to calendar system cycles and also some of the clever encoding in such works as the bible so
I do try to get all of this stuff tied together so it's not just relying upon biblical interpretation
now I'm going to get into some of those slides which do as I said some of the cometary stuff
though that is the visual sightings you don't if we get caught in the cometary stream you don't
necessarily have if it's a bit subtle you don't necessarily have physical evidence for all these
disruptions especially if you're more celestial than massive disruption to the tectonic plates but
I know what you're saying you know I'm not you're saying but I'm going to try and tie some of this
together so I'm going to just go to move on to the bible still and this we're going to look at the
this is a reference and I've got some physical data I'm going to show you for this one this is
interesting this is a celestial pavilion the king osia of juda and I'm going to show you
a few bible passages first off but first we're going to go to Immanuel Velikovsky because he
mentions this in his world's in collision book right so he talks about in the eighth century
it states here in the days of osia king of Jerusalem there occurred a devastating catastrophe
called rash or commotion emus who lived at the time of his eye began to predict a cosmic upheaval
before it took place and it was made two years before okay so in that moment let's just have a
look at the bible with book of emus this is just chapter one and just a bit of a summary here you
know this guy emus then is concerning two years before an earthquake is going on about I'm going
to send fire upon all these different places you know gaza tyrus team and all rest of it
and then he goes on to say chapter two I'm going to send fire on moab fire on juda devour all the
palaces of Jerusalem you know so this is what we're getting at here now here's another interesting
thing chapter five this is where we get another reference ye who turn judgment to wormwood and
leave off righteousness in the earth seek him that make it the seven stars that play these
and Orion and turn the shadow of death into the morning and make it the day dark with night
and he's basically again encoding in a kind of elaborate sense some of the elements in the sky
which are associated with a disaster alignment but let's just go again to velikovsky because
velikovsky nailed the date precisely for this he looked at certain records to do with various
let me show you here this again is velikovsky and and he nailed it to 747 and this is because of
certain new year traditions in in you know mexico when he went to there to study the cultures of
the Aztecs and whatever you know new years so this is from velikovsky again it says the year 747
if the commotion of the days of us i was a global character i was brought about by an extraterrestrial
agent it must have caused some disturbance in the motion of the earth on its axis along its orbit
such a disturbance would have made the old calendar obsolete and would have required the
introduction of a new calendar in 747 bc a new calendar was introduced in the middle east
and that year is known as the beginning of the era of nabor nasa he first talks about the middle
east he also talks about mesoamerican i'm gonna get into that shortly he says it is asserted that
some astronomical event gave birth to this new calendar but the nature of the event is not known
so we've got a calendar tradition something in 747 bc a new calendar but we also have this big
earthquake do we have any evidence of this yes this is a scientific article you're talking about
a magnitude earthquake and this again is from a various studies it says earthquake debris at six
sites this is all around you know israel it says it's tightly confined stratigraphically to the
middle of the eighth century bc with dating errors of about 30 years so the event points to a single
large regional earthquake that occurred about 750 bc at least 7.8 in magnitude maybe even 8.2
and it says here it appears with the largest yet documented on the dead sea transform fault zone
during the last four millennia and the dead sea transform fault likely ruptured along
more than 400 kilometers the ground shook violently over 90 seconds the urban panic
created by this earthquake would have been legendary so they've got you know the physical
evidence of a massive earthquake stood in the fault zone 750 bc but the calendar system velikovsky
looks at he gets this change in calendar 747 bc allowing us just to narrow it down but velikovsky
narrows it down brilliantly even further it says here firstly we know when osia reigned between
789 and about 740 and again this is direct quote from his book he says if this conclusion is correct
the upheaval took place in 747 bc the computation according to which the era stasis on the 26th
day of february must be reexamined in light of the fact that further cosmic disturbances occurred
in the decades that followed and then he goes on saying it is worth noting that the ancient
inhabitants of mexico celebrated their new year on the day which corresponds in the julian calendar
to the same date the first day of their year was the sixth and 20 day of february so if this is the
first day of the new year 26th of february 747 bc we need to just go to the final day in the
words one day prior to this is the final end of age day and if we do that and look right down on the
solar system on the 25th of february here is what we see a four body alignment here and this involves
the earth finus and mars but also the dwarf planet seris okay now seris is located between mars and the
Jupiter it's in the asteroid belt largest object there it's about uh i think 600 miles in diameter
our moon is about 2160 miles so it's only a small body but it is a proper spheroid body it's not a
jagged edge fragment so it's an important planet and um i'll just show you that if you were if you
are going to program the center you need to use the correct solution because the jpl guys this is
the solution that they had on the screen and this is what i call a miracle seris solution they had
this and then they modified it and degraded it so it were even worse but you must use i had to
manually program these elements into starry night to create seris i couldn't use the default one
because they modified it but they had this solution here and you will find seris is involved in many
end of age alignments but you must use this solution that's just for astronomers though but
let's just move on back to the alignment if we are now located the center of the earth and we look
all the way down the line okay this is where we've got seris venus and mars just off to the right here
but you've also got neptune urnus aligned right and look the pleides is right there it's again just
a couple of degrees off and it's one of those special directions in the sky remember what
a must said about the pleides but he also mentioned a ryan so we're just looking at this from the
perspective of the center of the earth right at the time you know 12 noon universal time 25th of
february right if we pull back a bit but maintain the same date okay and we're still from the center
of the earth we can see a connection between a ryan and the pleides connection here this is what we see
if we have got the constellation of a ryan here then basically from beetle juice if we
look at the direct line it crosses through this critical star p i3 orionis straight line all the
way and that targets seris and if we have this other star here it's scythe and we again go through
p i3 orionis we go all the way to the center of the pleides and it practically cuts through
aligning brilliantly with that slight offset neptune and urnus okay this is the connection
of a ryan linking to the pleides and it's all part of amos is encoding this configuration
and this nails the date uh the 25th of february so we've got you know the encoding from the astronomy
from the bible we've got the mexican new year tie-in uh got the the earthquake mentioned in the
bible we've got the the dead sea transform fault zone circa 750 you know so this is the kind of
work i do i look to try and tie it all together with the physical evidence and the encoding
that kind of thing okay but this is where we get now to some of the advanced mathematics of it
because this disaster alignment in 747 bc a calendar system was set in motion to target
this alignment from the exodus alignment using the 360 day calendar with a special adjustment
so if we go all the way back here then this is the exodus day of alignment 28th of march
right here so how do you calculate how do you target this future alignment of disaster
okay well firstly you have a special adjustment of 96 days now i realize you're thinking 96 days
well i've been a bit convenient here 96 days is used as a correction multiple times it's used
in the mayan lung counts before they target a disaster alignment involving three back tons
so it's used multiple times 96 days and what they do is they basically are going to count a 360 day
calendar okay but what they do first is they count 96 days as a special count okay then
they begin counting 360 days and they count precisely 720 of these ideal years right which is
722 times 360 okay so 720 cycles of 360 days after 96 day correction and then you target
with perfection the date here 25th of february the precise day of the destructive alignment okay
and this is the kind of stuff that's been going on in ancient times okay high precision targeting
of future disasters it's not all about prophecy in the sense of some guys being told some information
or a division people have been given or you know they've been given this esoteric calendar knowledge
they're using calendars to actively track these disasters centuries in advance okay so let's just
move on to another one we're now going to go from exodus to the destruction of the army center cherub
instead of just exodus to that disaster in 747 what they end up doing is running multiple calendars
in parallel to one another so we're going to target another day of disaster this one's from
isire okay this is just the destruction the army center cherub okay so center cherub has got his
army and they're all master around jerusalem you know it's a big siege type situation and so he goes
to king hezekai goes to isai and says what can you just ask the lord you know is he going to help
me out or whatever you know i'm surrounded here and isire comes back says don't worry about a thing
i the lord says he's going to blast center cherub's army okay behold i will send a blast upon him
you know so what happens is this then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of
the issyrians a 104 score and 5000 there's 185 000 men when they arose early in the morning behold
they were all dead corpses okay now i'll just tell you a little aside here 185 000 for the
number of men in center cherub's army is a total fiction as a matter of fact it's 185 000 days
backwards from the day of this disaster which with again a slight adjustment it gets you to
i believe it's 11 9 it's 11 93 bc when there's this comet which caused the disaster in that year
okay and he's basically giving you he's encoding the time interval between this disaster and one
that occurred in the past so that number 185 000 is a kind of fictitious embellishment
yes center cherub had an army but somebody has embellished the story with a special number of
days which you know he's he's encoded as a number of days but it's given as a number of men in his
army okay i see that a lot yeah and yeah is that special adjustment 96 days again or is it a different
type of em i think it's 196 days in that one okay okay but uh again i ain't got a slice prepared for
that one but it's no no no you're fine i just figured out yeah yeah um but anyway so again
what is the precise day then of disaster that we have right here what is the day well you know
there's a lot of people into velikovsky's i was watching you know i like watching youtube people
or the researchers talking about velikovsky and they were talking about um his work done
uh with the gas the exodus and i've just done a screenplay to somebody else's slide
just to show you what they said right so this is all about the exodus disaster now i've already
shown you the date 1457 bc but what they didn't go on to say they talk about certain critical
passages in the bible right when we're going to begin this new age okay so i've highlighted this
is somebody else's slide and they put down three days after the third new moon following their
departure following the exodus disaster there were thundering and lightnings and a loud trumpet
blast and the lord came down on mount sinai and heavens did bow and the earth did shake
and it said according to hepo tradition all nations heard the roaring of the law giving
and held the start of the seventh world age it says w in c part one that would be worlds
in collision so when i saw this reference here three days after the third new moon that's when
the moon is in a silhouette it's between the earth and the sun third day following the third new moon
well because we know the exact date of exodus we can work out exactly when this is so let's have a look
this here is the date then because exodus alignment was on the 28th of march 1457 on the seventh of
july we are now i've gone forward so we're on this is precisely okay the third new moon after the
exodus alignment so we go forward three more days on this so we go from the seventh to the 10th so the
moon's just gone here right it was at its optimum full moon when it's aligned with the sun so this
is the precise day referenced in the bible third day after the third new moon okay well here's where
things get very very interesting let's just move on we are now on this particular day third day
after the third new moon we are now precisely on the 10th of july and we're 104 days after the
exodus alignment so it's at this moment then that something very interesting happens
we're going to set in motion a calendar system a calendar system which is actually based upon
it's one that the ancient heroes know about but they've practically forgotten about it but it's
one that is well known in mesoamerica the Aztecs and the Mayans used this calendar system okay
but before we start counting it we need a special adjustment and here's where all the clever
mnemonics come in you know when you've got your third day of the third new moon right right there
before you begin counting the calendar cycle which is going to target the day of disaster
right moses is at Mount Sinai and the lord says to him okay moses i want you to start counting a
calendar cycle but before you do i want you to count six times six times six days which is 216
days okay so you're already on the third day following the third new moon and you count an
additional 216 days mathematically it's a clever mnemonic you know like third day of the third
new moon and then you have another adjustment of six times six times six days 216 days so if you do
this you're on the 11th of february 1456 and it is at this point the ancient hebrew start counting
a calendar cycle and the calendar cycle they count is based upon 819 days well real quick i just
thought it'd be funny to let people know 144 cubits is 216 feet so in measurement in terms of distance
space and time so to speak here you have 144 cubits equals 216 feet which is interesting that
number 216 six times six times six so yeah yeah they use multiples of six a lot of times you know
as a kind of special adjustment before setting in motion some calendar cycles and this is an
example here so from what i gather if you will look up 819 days as a calendar cycle yes we know
because we've got stone carving monuments that scholars have looked at the ancient you know mayans
and the Aztecs and wherever they use an 819 day calendar cycle it's just that's modern scholars
have no idea what they used it for they've kind of forgotten that okay but trust me they did we've
got the stone carvings to prove they used an 819 day calendar cycle the ancient hebrews also used
one but they seem to have almost forgotten about it but this is the cycle that was set in motion
after we've done this firstly 104 days and then an extra 216 days that's 320 days exactly from exodus
and we start counting right cycles of 819 days okay now the reason why i point out that the special
adjustment of 216 days whatever you want to think about the lord at mount signi a conversation let's
just say conversation took place moses and the lord and the lord says a when the third day of
the third new moon the lord says okay moses you just need to count six times six times six days
216 days then you're going to start counting cycles of 819 days well you know what every
jew's favorite number is you seven number seven they love the number seven don't that i i i i i
i've even seen rabbi's joke about it why do they like the number seven so much and this rabbi
was watching uh he was doing a presentation and he's just joking we said just said just multiply
everything by seven and it all makes sense i was still laughing at that one because how true it is
so when moses asks the lord the lord if i'm going to count these cycles of 819 days to
target some future disaster how many cycles do i count and the lord said unto moses you shall count
seven times seven times seven cycles of 819 days now seven times seven times seven is 343 so if you
multiply that by 819 you get 280,917 days and if you count precisely that number of days
from this here from the 11th of february you get to the 23rd of march 687 bc this is when
senor cherub's army was destroyed now how sure am i let's firstly have a look from a top down view
the solar system okay on this precise date and this is what we see two alignments offset from
one another jupiter venus mars and simultaneously jupiter sun seris okay now i will tell you
straight out it's part of my more in-depth analysis um in greek mythology uh there's a story about
phython who is the child of the sun who is killed by jupiter with a thunderbolt that story
encodes this alignment seris is phython jupiter is Zeus and jupiter basically has a kind of energetic
exchange with seris which causes seris to develop cometary properties it triggers it okay so in
greek mythology this precise date 23rd of march 687 bc is the story of phython but in the bible
it's the destruction of the army of senor cherub we get some kind of blasts going off and the earth
is struck by you know cometary debris things like that and this is the alignment now
what i want to show you though is you know how we've seen the plaides so often associated with
these alignments okay if we position ourselves the center of jupiter and look all the way down
the line especially towards seris we see the following there's the plaides lined up it's part
of the alignment here the sun and seris and here the center of jupiter mars and venus in close
alignment okay now velikovsky again in his book world's in collision you know the only problem
velikovsky had i might you know i have so much sympathy for you i just i feel for him world's
in collision came out in 1950 pcs did not exist this guy did the research and found the correct
dates but he could not look at the solar system to see the alignments associated with it he didn't
know why these dates were the right ones but in world's in collision then he has a few passages
from it okay because he was trying to figure out when senor cherub's army was destroyed
and he got the data from various jewish traditions and chinese astronomical records
this is what he found he's talking about the army of senor cherub being destroyed then
and he says well for a more exact date for the night of the annihilation
modern research we know that it was the year 687 bc okay talmud and midrash give another valuable
clue the destruction occurred during the first night of Passover okay and then he goes on to talk
about chinese records and the court here at the bottom the year 687 bc in the summer in the fourth
moon in the day sin mao 23rd of march during the night the fixed stars did not appear though the
night was clear in the middle of the night stars fell like rain something very extraordinary was
going off in the solar system the next page the date 23rd of march it's beot's calculation says
though the night was clear a star fell in the form of rain and then it goes on the annals of the
bamboo books obviously first the same event when they inform us that in the 10th year of the emperor
qui the 17th emperor of the dynasty you or the 18th monarch since yahoo the five planets went out of
their courses again shaking you know the earth shaking so the planets just look a bit like
they're going off course here a bit in the night stars fell like rain the earth shook and they give
it here the 23rd of march 687 bc and that alignment two alignments offset involving jupiter okay jupiter
venus mars and jupiter serris son with the plades that was the alignment that triggered it and they
knew about it centuries in advance they had a calendar system targeting it okay so this is where
and the reason why i'm so happy to show you that alignment is because this is crucial because that
alignment was a bona fide end of age alignment involving some destructive effects we're now
going to go on to discuss crucifixion day okay now so jesus is around at the time and what is he
telling people he's saying guys get ready the kingdom of heaven is near there's going to be all kinds
of signs in the sky moon's going to go blood red sun's going to go black oh and by the way
you lot this generation you that i'm speaking to you will live to see it all he's absolutely
correct well how do we determine crucifixion day let's have a look
we use the alignment date the 23rd of march 687 bc destruction of the army of senator up
we use this precise alignment day here in order to target crucifixion day okay
so we're going to do it using the 360 day calendar system this is what jesus did
this here is absolutely confirmed in the bible
so do we start counting cycles of 360 days straight away in order to target the crucifixion
day no the harmony does not exist we need a special adjustment and what adjustment do we use
before we start counting six times six times six days 216 days again this takes us to the 25th
of october 687 bc now we start counting cycles of 360 days how many do we count and the answer
we love our mnemonics nine times nine times nine that's 729 cycles of 360 days and if you do that
you drop on the 3rd of may 33 ad is this crucifixion day no we've overshot the mark
we all know there's a certain guy who is intimately associated with the crucifixion story
judas okay we all know the story of judas he betrays jesus for 30 pieces of silver now if
you're into astrology you know that the sun the sun is gold sun is gold but the moon is silver
and when somebody says how many days are there in a month you're gonna say well 30 30 usually
in the sense of an ideal month yes 360 days for an ideal year has a calendar cycle 30 days for a
month the story of judas is the story of the backward correction of 30 days from this date
3rd of may 33 ad but what else do we know about judas well it's in the gospel of matthew apparently
is so guilt ridden by this this money they try to give it away do you know for the temple or
ever but they don't want it because it's blood money and what's the color of blood red so you've
got 30 pieces of silver he's instructing you to go backwards from this date here 30 days until you
get to this date here and this is crucifixion day 3rd of abel 33 ad now there's a few other people
got this date they're correct about it but they don't necessarily know why what makes it so decisive
well firstly let's just go on to mention the following if you do a a quick check of a Passover
Calculate 3rd of April 33 ad this is from midrash.org if you put it in the aduling calendar to the
bottom left 33 of April 3rd ad it's 15 nissan okay now 15 nissan as all Jews know that's
Passover day okay that's Passover day it always occurs on 15 nissan and that ties into certain
things in the bible okay but let's have a look then so what's so special about crucifixion day
well in order to understand it well let's just introduce you to the following little guy
as opposed to Elon muskman say this is an absolute unit but uh you know the reference
so again this guy here then this is a ram rams our male sheep and lambs you've got you lambs
and ram lambs they're young sheep okay so i just thought i'd mentioned lambs let's now talk about
another lamb the lamb of god this is a picture here from 1432 or circa ad by Jan van Eyck adoration
of the mystic lamb and it says he a lamb of god it says here that Jesus is usually referred to
when john the baptist sees Jesus and exclaims behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of
the world okay christian doctrine holds that's divine jesus chose to suffer crucifixion at calvary
is a sign of his full obedience to the will of his divine father as an agent and servant of god
in christian theology the lamb of god is viewed as foundational and integral to the message of
christianity this picture here you've got the lamb and it's like wounded and it's pouring blood into
this chalice right and you've also got some angels stood around and you got the cross the crucifixion
day this is a kind of allegorical crucifixion scene the lamb of god is present on crucifixion day
okay and we're going to see that very shortly but firstly let's just go to the next slide
so this is the third of april 33 ad precisely 12 noon universal time a whole number of julian days
and we're at the center of the earth and we are looking towards the moon okay and there's the moon
bright silver but remember the judas month is associated with blood if we make it just a
slight adjustment here very so slightly and go backwards though so forwards in time two hours
51 minutes you'll see the moon is kind of blood red this is because on the third of april 33 ad
we have a lunar eclipse and this is the significance of the blood money reference 30 pieces of silver
a 30-day movement backwards to a blood moon a lunar eclipse this here then on 1451 universal time
is the optimum when the moon is at its deepest red okay we are at the optimum right here of the
eclipse now if we position ourselves at the center of the moon and look towards the center of the
earth we will see the lamb of god so here it is aries the constellation aries the ram the lamb
and i've got here you can see at the bottom i've had to do a silhouette this is the the
starry night package this is where the earth is shown i've had to put a little blue ring around
because it's just a silhouette and the sun is actually behind the earth because it's a a lunar
eclipse okay so you can't even see it but what i want to draw your attention to then is when we're
right here at the optimum okay there's certain special relations between the center of the earth
and certain stars associated with aries you will find that the arc measure between the center of the
earth and hamel and the center of the earth and chariton practically dead on optimum you know we
think about lambs of in the the rams of in the throats court sacrificed on the rest of it this
again this is all tied into the symbolism which all has to do with this astronomical alignment
right here okay it's all to do with this alignment and this is where you have this angular offset
almost perfectly matched here but this isn't the only thing that's significant about this date
it's not just the lunar eclipse let's have a top-down view of the solar system right on the
third of april same date this is what you see two alignments going up at the same time jupiter
mars venus jupiter seris sun and also mercury now if we position ourselves the center of jupiter and
look all the way down the line we also find that pluto is part of the alignment amazingly enough
so there are the planets there all lined up and then we've got mars and venus here we're at the
center of jupiter so jupiter is aligned separately to these two groups okay so let's just have a look
again from the top view there it is now ladies and gentlemen when you get certain special alignments
you get energetic effects and alignments which have a similar type also because they are so
similar can also produce the same effects does this pattern look familiar well let's just lay
this pattern side by side to the destructive alignment of 687 bc and there you have it 687 bc
top left jupiter venus mars and here at crucifixion day jupiter mars venus top left here jupiter sun
seris crucifixion day jupiter seris sun same body's aligned but the order is switched but the energetic
effect is still present and this was a bona fide event so when people talked about things going
strange on crucifixion day for example this guy here wrote all about it the testimony fleagant
vindicated or an account of the great darkness and earthquake at our saviour's passion that's
exactly what happened we're all supposed to pretend though it didn't happen you know but it did happen
the moon went blood red the sun darkened midday and it was because the sun's light waves were
temporarily cancelled because of this special conjunction pattern okay this is what caused it
to happen okay so that right there is how we targeted the crucifixion day now what i want to
get on to next then is part two and this is where i need to switch to a different
file so i'll need to just take the screen share off and switch to a another file now this next
presentation though let me just stop this screen share here so you can you see me again fully
yeah so what i'm going to do then i'm going to now look in some detail as some of the key
parables in the life of jesus and i'm going to sort out some really good controversy between jesus
and john the baptist because the same parables in the life of jesus um and these parables were
designed basically to target various destructive alignments okay they were used to target these
alignments um using cycles of primarily 3200 days with certain adjustments or cycles of 360 days
so jesus again circa 2000 years ago that's when he was born right and we had these alignments um
and my phone's kind of ringing now just i think they'll ring back i don't think we can hear it so
you're good oh yeah yeah but um i'll i'll just let it ring it um so basically
the the same presentation is going to look at the the parables of jesus and it's going to look at
precisely um just how he targets certain individual alignments okay very special alignments uh in the
future which are very destructive so um in fact can you just hold on a minute it's just
really ringing here just one moment it put a wrong number i can't believe it the stars didn't line up
this time so i think i think you said he said oh he's like you also might i thought what
dude i'm in the middle of a serious uh you know well you know i i have so many um ideas i just
want you to present today because i i definitely want to have you come back too we can we can
wrestle with ideas and kind of like discuss different things because i think that you're
on to something there's something here and oh yeah in me being a skeptic okay the i i look at the new
testament this is just my hunch and i'm just throwing it out there for our audience who's
gotten this farm i am no scholar i i cannot speak definitively on this but like stuff like
let's say like uh herod going after all the two-year-olds and under we know that's that copies from
the exodus we have no sources outside of what we have in the gospel narrative to suggest that herod
really was doing that historically but i had this uh recent interview i did with a lady lady named
lana einhorn she looked at jocephus and she looked at the gospels and she found that the key players
not just like obscure like oh well that's up for interpretation like we're talking roman emperors
and like very important high priests that were supposed to exist during the time of the thirties
they're not found there in jocephus in fact they're found later by 15 20 years or something
but i asked her at the end of the day i said miss einhorn why would they put the story though
into the thirties and she says i can guess well what if what you're telling me what if this is
the reason what if just saying let's just suppose they had such a deep connection to the celestial
bodies and what happens in the heavens that they have this esoteric and religious fervor
they want to place these events close just speculating and throwing it out there to these
to these events that are in the heavens just saying because even even some people say well
they would never have crucified this man on Passover and and and they say this is possibly
fiction however this what you're telling me in my opinion is accurate like like if you're
gonna really find the real historical look up and stop trying to act like it literally happened
in the story in the literal sense there's probably something there and it could be wrong i'm just
i'm just throwing it out there for me um there is a connection between uh the old testament and
the new testament i realized they're very different but the mathematics that tie together such as
Noah's flood and the exodus event um they integrate with the mathematics that i'm going to show you
regarding the parables of jesus so this the same tradition of embedding numbers in stories
right it is so crucial i mean you know in in genesis uh they mentioned six days of creation
and then the author wants for some reason to mention the seventh day three times because he
wants to mention the number seven three times Noah when he's releasing birds you know he has three
seven day intervals because again he kind of wants to mention the number seven times you know seven
three times and you're multiplying it together and you're doing this for various calendar reasons
and uh when you look at Jesus he's got all kinds of parables hey i'm feeding five thousand people
i'm feeling four thousand people i've got 12 baskets we're gonna have seven baskets of scraps
left over or whatever you know there's a woman she's she said issues of the blood i.e blood moon
blood moon hint you know she said blood moon issues for 12 years there's a young girl she's on death's
door she dies she's 12 jesus raises her from the dead you know all these stories what jesus is doing
is he is he lives my my view is this just and i realize you've had quite a few people on talking
about jesus you know and they're looking at the who is the real jesus and you see um Robert is he
isan man is it isan um he did the tons of people robert and christ dr bob there's a whole bunch of
people yeah i think robert isan man he i've seen a lot of his presentations and he james the brother
of jesus was one of his books and you know and he talks about you know he's trying to find out who
is the real jesus and mentions that the jesus of the gospel is like the literary jesus as he puts it
okay well my personal view is and i just look at it this way i am interested in the mastermind
behind these stories that's jesus for me that's the guy i'm interested in he may have been a
guy that had some a close group of people around him and they were like scribes and he said listen
carefully i'm going to tell you some stories and just like Socrates is used by Plato in his dialogues
jesus uses himself as a central character in a fictional public life story about him traveling
around to all these different places like Galilee and Bethlehem and Jerusalem or whatever and sending
messages all over the place and you know healing people and it's all essentially fiction but he
encodes all these numbers in them and all these numbers they refer to basically there's certain
key alignment dates which are like critical anchor points like crucifixion day it's a critical anchor
point and you go backwards a certain number of days to target other dates all within his own
lifetime and all the parables with all these numbers they're all about adjustments of days
backwards and forwards to target critical dates within the lifetime of jesus which are the starting
dates for setting in motion calendars based upon 360 days or 3200 days which target future disaster
alignments centuries or millennia in advance now in some senses i do think that some of the people
in the bible when the gospels were written they probably were written well after jesus had died
and i think people have even mentioned like um you know obviously jesus sports have been preaching
before the temples destroyed and this is before the old synagogue thing took off from what i gather
but the synagogues mentioned in the bible and they shouldn't really exist this is what another
research i think you had on mentioned something like that and so there's people talking about
when herod supposedly died or whatever and this is why some people talk about it being the fourth
century four bc or six bc and stuff like that when jesus is born well i'm going to show you
precise dates here which i believe are the correct dates when jesus was born as encoded in the bible
and that's the critical point somebody's trying to send a message here and you've got to be carefully
how you look at some of this detail but i'm going to hopefully give you some very decisive solutions
which are astronomical and we're going to sort out some hardcore controversy so i'm going to
screen share and show you all about the uh the life of jesus again with his second presentation
right you see it says gospels on screen there yeah okay so let's begin okay so we're now going to look at
when was jesus conceived and when was he born and also how this ties into john the baptist
so we know what the precise day of crucifixion day is okay so let's have a look at a nice reference
here to something called the annunciation this is when uh like the angel gabriel goes to visit
mary uh you know blessed virgin mary and says uh mary you're going to have a child is going to be
really important in the eyes of god you know jesus and all rest of it annunciation day okay
so when is annunciation day well here's how we target it precisely and i do mean precisely
firstly we're at crucifixion day jesus supposedly dies here you know the ritual
where it happens three days later he rises rose from the dead three days later go forwards three
days this is resurrection day annunciation day is harmonized to this day via 360 day cycle specifically
if we go back 33 cycles of 360 days we drop on the 26th of september 1 bc this is annunciation
day with regards to mary okay 26th of september 1 bc this is under the julian calendar here is
where the controversy begins there are certain dates associated with the catholic and christian
tradition uh which are very interesting to this story you see we have a date associated with
annunciation day uh under the julian calendar which is different to the 26th of september
but that date 26th of september he's absolutely correct let's look at the reference though
this is annunciation and this refers to uh we're going to get into it but this is where we get the
reference in the bible this is from the gospel of luke there's something very special that we hang
upon annunciation day for mary okay and that's the birth of john the baptist you see from the
gospel of luke then luke 26 he says in the sixth month of elizabeth's pregnancy god sent the angel
gabriel to the town of galley and went see uh mary okay but here's the thing uh she's gonna mary has
a relative elizabeth and the angel gabriel says he says to mary he says um you know as i'm telling
you right now mary you're gonna have a child jesus and he's going to be really important
well as i am telling you right now this your relative elizabeth i told us something very similar
a few months back and as we speak right now she is uh precisely in the sixth month of her
pregnancy now bingo we have it right there we know elizabeth is sixth month pregnant with john
the baptist on annunciation day so if we want to find out when uh john the baptist is born because
elizabeth has john the baptist as a child right we want to know when john the baptist is born
all we need to do is go forwards three months from annunciation day with respect to mary now
month is precisely 30 days in this calendar system okay so let's do the math this year then
annunciation for mary angel gabriel goes to see mary says you're gonna have jesus but your
relative elizabeth right now is already six months pregnant with john the baptist so john
the baptist is going to be born three months or 90 days after the 26th of february so if we want to
work out the day when john the baptist is born he was born on the 25th of december 1 bc
now how controversial i know what everyone's thinking 25th of december that's like christmas
that's when jesus was born no that's when john the baptist was born not jesus the cleverness
continues if we want to know when john the baptist was conceived it's nine months from
conception to birth we could go back precisely nine times 30 or 270 days from this day right here
conception day is of course important but the clever author of the gospel of luke does not want
us to go back 270 days from this date he wants to draw attention to a special adjustment so again
the gospel of luke he goes on to say that after elizabeth has given birth to john the baptist
on the eighth day he was circumcised okay that's when he's called john okay so let's do the math
he's born on 25th of december eight days later we're on the second of january 1 ad john circumcised
now the angel of gabriel as i've only mentioned visits mary as you can see here on the 26th of
september to say mary is going to have jesus the angel gabriel previously visited elizabeth
to say that she was going to have john the baptist when's enunciation day essentially with respect
to elizabeth the answer is if we go back 270 days nine months after we've had this eight day
correction if we go back from this date here second of january we get to enunciation day
which is the following there the seventh of april one bc enunciation day for elizabeth
now what was that tradition again let me just show you enunciation with respect supposedly to
mary right the feast of enunciation is on the 25th of march okay that's where it says many
christians observe this event and if you look at the bottom here it says it's the 25th of march
under the gregorian calendar but for those using the old style julian calendar march the 25th
falls on april the seventh okay right there so we have got a big problem here the date associated
with the birth of jesus the 25th of december is actually the birthday of john the baptist not
jesus the date the seventh of april associated with enunciation respecting mary is not it's actually
associated with elizabeth with regards to john the baptist so you see how we've got a bit of a
controversy here you are you're definitely a heretic oh yes this is hardcore heresy but
it gets better we've got this lamb of god reference you know there's such an intimate
connection between john the baptist and jesus and when john the baptist first sees jesus he says
behold the lamb of god there's a reference to this lamb of god and john the baptist if we stick on
this seventh of april date here right it turns out we're on a full moon on this date seventh of
april one bc enunciation day so in other words basically elizabeth gets visited by the angel
gabriel and says you're gonna have a child she's already eight days into conception but obviously
if you're only eight days into conception you know you wouldn't necessarily know you're pregnant you
see okay but here we have this full moon okay we just have to have it on the enunciation date
respecting elizabeth seventh of april so if we do what we did on crucifixion day let's position
ourselves at the center of the moon and look towards the earth and what do we see there's that
lamb of god again and in this case we've just gone forwards 12 minutes from 12 known still
seventh of april and this puts us in an optimum when the line connecting the sun and the earth is
90 degrees to this green line which is the earth's orbital sun so this is the optimum the precise
optimum and if you do that then the following relations hold true and that precise optimum
in passing when the line connects in the earth to the sun is at 90 degrees we have an almost dead
on angular uh correspondents between the center of the earth and this 41 ariettesis and the center
of the earth and hamel the same kind of special sort of equidistant relation you know present right
here and again let me just show you remind you on crucifixion day right when we did a lunar eclipse
this one was crucifixion day third of april and it's center of the earth
to hamel and shout it so for jesus it's to do with the stars corresponding to the head of aries
whereas with john the baptist it's the body of aries okay very interesting okay but let's just
move on a bit further so jesus is the main mani and i've just told you all about john the baptist
right this is where things get quite bizarre so if we know when john the baptist was conceived
we know when annunciation day was with respect to elizabeth right and we know that john the
baptist was born 25th of december when was jesus conceived and when was jesus born he's the main
man it's quite simple if we are here this is when angel gable visits mary say you're going to have
jesus okay it's 26th of september one bc when is jesus born well the answer is three months later
sorry not born conceived is conceived on the 25th of december that is the very day that john the
baptist is born okay the day john the baptist is born on the 25th jesus is conceived okay and this
might be where the controversy the kind of mix-up comes in because if somebody says you know jesus
our lord entered the world on so and such did if somebody says enter the world yeah most people
think yeah they're born but that could also mean conception and i think that's where the mix-up is
so this is the interesting connection between jesus and john john's born on 25th of december
jesus is conceived on the 25th of december one bc now if we know then jesus is conceived here
we can also know when jesus was actually born nine months later 270 days exactly and so let's go
forwards to his birthday this year is when jesus was actually born 21st of september one ad okay
precise date what else do we know about the birth of jesus what do we all know about him
he's born of a virgin and no i'm not talking about mary let's have a look at the virgin
this is the virgin vergo the constellation aka the maiden the virgin okay jesus is born
of a virgin okay so if we're looking at vergo here we might ask ourselves
what is the most significant star in the entire constellation the answer is this one right here
spiker aka alpha virginus the brightest star in the entire constellation the most important
okay so let's have a look at those dates again jesus is born then 21st of september one ad
270 days after 25th of december one bc turns out something quite interesting about when
jesus is born we've got a full moon and if we've got a full moon wouldn't it be a very interesting
idea to position ourselves at the center of the moon and look to the earth and if we do that
what do we see what's that in the background virgin the vergo constellation you'll see that
we're at 12 noon okay so why don't we just go through star anite to optimize so that the line
connecting the center of the earth to the sun is at 90 degrees right there on the most perfect
optimum and if we do that here is what we find if we just zoom in a bit more it turns out on that
very precise optimum the line connecting the earth to the sun cuts perfectly through spiker
and this is just two hours 42 minutes from 12 noon on the same day this ladies and gentlemen
is the virgin birth this is it this is it it's astronomical it's not an immaculate conception
it's this alignment between the moon the earth and the sun cutting through spiker okay
but let's move on another interesting tradition
jesus and john the baptist are connected on the 25th of december 1 bc john is born on that day
jesus is conceived they also meet up in life okay and john baptizes jesus so when is jesus
baptized well we again can point to a tradition which in this case is absolutely correct
baptism of jesus states here in eastern christianity jesus's baptism is commemorated on the sixth
of january julian calendar date okay sixth of january what year what that's the crucial question
well once you know it's the sixth of january if you start looking at a few different years
close to you know after jesus is born you hit upon a brilliant connection and when you see it
you know it's the answer you know it's the answer so here we are then 21st of september 1 ad
jesus is born how many days are there from this date to when jesus is baptized and the correct
answer is 7777 days because if you count forwards that number of days from this date you drop upon
the 6th of january on the 23 23 ad that's when jesus is baptized okay dead on very interesting
but let's just go further remember when we had the john the baptist thing okay what we're going to
do now is we're going to actually connect up and deduce the precise date when john the baptist dies
now in this case then i've just gone backwards um i've just come backwards here
i think i'm losing my own plot here i've just gone backwards precisely eight days from the sixth of
january you know how when john the baptist is born it makes a point of saying he's circumcised eight
days later well when we've got this baptism uh date here of 6th of january when john and jesus
are together john baptised jesus in order to determine the day when john the baptist dies
we we do a couple of adjustments okay firstly we go back eight days it's like that eight day forward
movement we're almost taking it back so we go back eight days from here from baptism date the 29th
of december when we are here we next go forwards a certain special number of days to target the
precise day when john the baptist dies now how many days do we go forwards this is incredible
you see how we have four sevens here 7777 days the total number of days that we move forwards
from the 29th of december okay is derived by multiplying the number seven by itself four
times in other words we go forwards seven times seven times seven times seven days
2 401 days okay right there that's how we get to the day when john the baptist dies which is
on the 26th of july 29 ad now what what is so interesting about this there's two things to
consider how old is john the baptist when he dies his date of death when you look at it
set against his day of birth harmonizes to the 360 day calendar cycle it turns out
that if john the baptist's date of death is the 26th of july 29 ad and we go backwards
precisely 29 cycles of 360 days which is 10440 days we are on the 25th of december he's exactly
29 years old per this ideal year of 360 days okay but what else do we know about john the
baptist what does everybody know if you said how how did john the baptist die what does tradition
tell us he had his head cut off we need to get into this so on the precise day that john the
baptist dies in 26th of july let's have a nice lovely top down view of the solar system wouldn't
you just know it we've got an amazing four body alignment jupiter earth venus and seris
slight adjustment less than 24 hours and we will be able to optimize jupiter the earth venus and seris
and if we do that if we optimize it for those four bodies and we position ourselves the center
of jupiter and look all the way down the line on the day john the baptist dies which is a slight
adjustment backwards 17 hours here is what we see constellation virgo the two stars that
mark out the head of virgo zania and zavi java and from the center of jupiter then seris earth and
venus the line connecting them cuts through the head of virgo this is the beheading of john the
baptist okay this is it and at the same time as that's just an optimum mercury amazingly enough
is like precisely dead on aligned with the zavi java you know it's just the top head star amazing
so this right here then this is what you've got with respect to the death of john the baptist
but now i want to get into something very interesting because what i've been talking about
i've been talking about how jesus encodes in his stories future destructive alignments
and he uses cycles of 360 days but also another very important cycle he uses is 3200 days units of
that and he targets certain future destructive alignments okay via that calendar cycle and some
of his parables are used to cleverly get you to the right date in his own lifetime to set in
motion cycles of 3200 days to target these future alignments of disaster okay and so let's get into
looking at some of these future world age ending alignments okay because jesus targets many of
them so the first one i'm going to do three in fact let's just summarize you can see here in this
summary here this is how we got from the the birth of jesus 21st of september through to the death
of john the baptist you know from birth of jesus we go forwards here 7777 days to get to the sixth
of january jesus is baptized we minus eight days we then go forwards seven times seven times seven
times seven days 2004 no one days that gets us to the death of john the baptist okay hold all that
there we're just going to go backwards a little bit here's the death of john the baptist then
well here's the death of john the baptist what we're going to do next then is we're going this is
actually a critical date that is used as the basis for targeting a future alignment with a special
adjustment in this case 770 days okay if we go forward 770 days from the death of john the baptist
and oh we love these sevens we're on the 4th of september 31 ad we now start counting cycles of
3200 days and in this case we count 150 cycles and if we do that we count precisely 480 000 days
and this targets the following date the 4th of november 1345 ad this is when we had a massive
celestial disaster and this is associated with revelation 12 in the bible okay let me show you a
top down view of the soul system then on this date 4th of november 1345 this is the most significant
conjunction pattern in all the mysteries it's a recurring pattern with one additional
alignment thrown in the core pattern is mars venus sun and mercury targeting close to the galactic
center whilst simultaneously we have the sun the earth targeting to the plades now it just so happens
that at this particular time we also have simultaneously jupiter venus and cerisoline
that's a kind of variant additional conjunction but the core pattern is the mars venus sun mercury
and the uh sun earth plades this is the one i mentioned right at the beginning of the interview
okay so what happened when this alignment occurred well let me just show you how accurate it is
with respect to venus and mars and the earth so if we position ourselves at the center of the sun
and look towards the two bodies here whatever we've got mars and venus here
and we've also got the earth and the plades here okay so that's how accurate it is so
if we reverse it and we look from the center of mars down the line we get the following though
look at what's going off here we've got the precise moment here we've got the sun here
on the 4th of november at the midpoint between the sting of the scorpion shawla and zisopentis
serpent's cowder means serpent's tail and just next to the foot of a fucus constellation okay
so this is part of the alignment okay now in luke 9 and 10 jesus sends out his 72 messages and this
is what i said at the beginning there's 72 alignments of venus and mars that we turn them to the same
point in the sky okay they are the messengers so when this alignment is achieved here then
the planets go into resonant agitation and we have cometary effects generated okay
and these will be with respect to venus and murcia i would imagine and what the specific line in the
bible is i'm just going by memory but i'm sure everybody can look it up is 72 messengers have all
returned and one of them says something like you know i watch satan fall like lightning from the
sky or something and jesus says you see i give you all powers over the enemy i give you the power
to tread on serpents and scorpions nothing can hurt you your names are written in heaven and here
we've got the foot of a fucus effectively treading on the sting of the scorpion below the ecliptic
and on the serpent's tail above the ecliptic this this is in cordity luke 9 and 10 in codes
this alignment right here when this alignment occurred then we had a massive disaster you see
i realized that it's one of those things which is actually associated with the black death the great
plague okay because it was massive 1340s through to you know half the population of world died by
some estimate sort of third and we have a precise reference to this not just to the plague but we
also have a reference to the precise details of the alignment so here the work of victor club and
bill nape they looked at various ancient chroniclers and they found a guy who talked about something
very interesting happened in happening in 1345 and this is the reference from their book the cosmic
winter one chronicler at least reports of the most immediate cause of the plague in 1345 and it goes
under say that between kathie and persia now kathie is china persia is iran you know that's what those
two countries are between kathie and persia they're rained a vast rain of fire falling in flakes like
snow and burning up mountains and plains and other lands with men and women and then arose
vast masses of smoke and whosoever beheld this died within the space of half a day this is what
was witnessed in the sky because the planets went to certain resident agitation cometaries
tales were established and the earth essentially went through the debris field and this is what
they're seeing and this polluted the atmosphere and this is how we had the plagues so we didn't
have any massive geophysical effects at this time okay but what we had instead was the the plagues
themselves okay caused by the toxic atmosphere because we got caught in a cometary stream
and just to give you a nice diagrammatic representation of it this then is the very special
world age ending alignment and this image is diagrammatically this where you get mars venus the
sun and mercury targeting close to the galactic center simultaneously the sunday earth and the
plagues okay and this is a recurring pattern and i will just show you now because we mentioned guys
like randall carlsson uh gray mancock and they've looked at all the the catastrophe you know that
occurred going back to you know 10 000 bc or whatever well let me just show you i've looked
at the geophysical record and all the evidence and we have this particular configuration occur
on an irregular cycle it occurs with a frequency of 1183 years 1343 years and also it has another
interval of 788 years and if you work out all the past instances in time when this alignment has
occurred they correspond very accurately with destruction in the geophysical records so here
is a summary listing of it here you can see 10 964 bc that's the whole comet thing everyone talks
about the cometary bombardment okay the precise dates you've got here of the starry night when
this alignment is an optimum 3rd of august 10 964 bc you've got from the studies of the
younger drys at gobeckley tepe they actually gave the date of 10 950 encoded in the calendar stones
at gobeckley tepe i think it's the vulture stone or something and this again corresponds to a geophysical
record so the error rate the difference is only 14 years okay you've then got the younger drys end
period again you can this is a data based upon a series of ice core samples 96 12
again it's the precise average of some data on wikipedia it's 96 12 is the precise date they give
the precise date of this alignment here was the 2nd of august 96 21 bc only nine years different
then we don't seem to have any anything in the geophysical record it's almost like it's mild
so we don't seem to have anything corresponding here on 84 38 bc but then when we go here
31st of august 9 650 bc well we're only 10 years off 76 40 bc and there's the work of the
paulmans for a cometary bombardment and i actually have the book somewhere here
um for a disaster alignment um i can't think where it is at the moment but i i've got the
book it's from uh what is it urials machine ah this is the book here and the diagram they can't
see they can't see you or me during the entire presentation though so just a heads up yeah okay
though the book is called urials machine i'll hold this up later but this they have the work of the
paulmans uh in the um in this particular presentation they literally give the date through radio carbon
dating of 76 40 bc and that's their date they're already 10 years off when that alignment occurred
within of massive floods and volcanoes and 64 40 the 64 40 bc event that's actually
timed most accurately to a massive volcano that exploded again it's only 27 years from
another instance of this alignment here in orange 64 67 we appear to have been mild nothing in the
geophysical record necessarily for 5124 we also have what's known as the intense aridization event
3941 bc this is when we had a sudden drying spell occur um you know expansion of desert somewhere
if you're very sudden it's like the energy output of the sun changed again one of the
effects of these alignments so that occurred there then in 3153 bc when this pattern occurred
we had a comet to strike this is per the work of uh ionis laritsis or professor laritsis
university roads he came with 31 50 bc and there's also a magnetic field blip going off
around about the same time magnetic field blip also corresponds to the 76 40 or 50 bc date
we then have two dates here 1970 and 627 bc they appear again not to have any dramatic effects
in the geophysical record associated with this alignment but then we move on to 557 ad this is
what begun the dark ages there's a few disaster alignments that occurred so this alignment occurred
again in 557 ad and jesus also encodes it but that's another presentation and he also encodes it again
which is the one i've just looked at fourth and november 1345 ad precise day of the optimal
alignment so out of the past um at 12 times this alignment has occurred eight of those times we have
had something massive occur you know in the geophysical record either cometary bombardments
you know uh caught in a cometary stream changes in the energy output of the sun you know stuff
like that it's been really devastating so two out of three times when this has occurred in the
past 12 times we've been devastated the next time this alignment occurs is in 25 28 but we may have
some sooner than that even so let's just move on to the next one let me show you another interesting
this is a little citation from a book called the book of miracles which is actually something
that was wrote in the 16th century ad and they give the year 1300 and it states here this is a
quote from the book in 1300 ad a terrible comet appeared in the sky and in this year on saint
andrew's day an earthquake shook the ground so that many buildings collapsed this is very
interesting that they talk about a comet but they also mention an earthquake occurring and i like
these references because the minute they say an earthquake occurred we can pinpoint the precise
date so this says it occurred on saint andrew's day we know when saint andrew's day is wikipedia to
the rescue saint andrew's day occurs on the 30th of november okay so if we know the year 1300 ad
and we know 30th of november okay well this particular comet was no ordinary comet
okay and jesus knew all about this let's have a look though at the alignment itself from a top
down view 30th of november 1300 ad wouldn't you just know it jupiter venus mercury and ceris
forebody alignment also the earth mercury and the sun are aligned okay separately contributing
conjunction but if we position ourselves right at the center of jupiter and look all the way
down the line of the forebody alignment what do we see our good buddy the pleiades nicely lined up
it's one of these dangerous directions in the sky the comet in question is undoubtedly ceris
and in fact we're actually looking from ceris itself not jupiter we're looking at ceris so
we're seeing jupiter there okay so this is the alignment right ceris would have flared up to
develop i think a cometary tail and when they talk about the comet they're talking about ceris
ceris was only officially discovered in 1802 i believe this is when we actually saw it with
a telescope and realized it was an object as part of our solar system before that time we didn't
know it was there but it appears to have been caught up in some of these conjunctions and
flared up periodically to develop cometary tails and so we've seen it but we've not realized
that it's an object in our own solar system so when it's died back down and become invisible
we didn't know so we've been thinking ceris is a different comet every time it's the same one but
we didn't know this i think on multiple occasions if we just switched to jupiter to look down the
line this is where you see the the sting of the scorpions pincers here and these are the the
planets from the other direction okay so this was a bona fide destructive alignment and jesus
incorporated this into the bible and so let me show you how he did it he's quite ingenious
we're back to the death of john the baptist but we know if we count 770 days from this
and then we count 150 cycles of 3200 days we target that fourth of november 1345 ad well here
then what we're going to do is we're going to target the 1300 ad this is what jesus did
we just go forwards an extra 360 days you know he says if john the baptist instead
of dying at 29 he dies at 30 okay so to speak so the correction is one more cycle of 360 days
this gets us to the 21st of july 30 ad now we start counting once again cycles of 3200 days
in this case 145 which is precisely 464 000 days and if we do that
bang we target with perfection 30th of november 1300 ad that's the day of the earthquake that's
the day of the optimum alignment so jesus seems to know about it okay and we have another reference
very similar let's have a look at the great comet of 1556 and again this is where we still
really hadn't gone brilliantly with astronomy we're still using telescopes and in the way we
do now and we hadn't really figured out how orbits worked and we certainly hadn't discovered seris
properly so in 1556 then there's this great comet appears and it's usually referred to as
charles the fifth comet and it's called that because he says when the emperor first
caught sight of it he stood aghast and exclaimed by this dread sign my fates do summon me charles had
long meditated about retiring from the world he had conquered and crushed this is when spanish
empire was at its height and he regarded this comet as a sign from heaven to do so so he went to
this monastery okay so this is a great comet then of 1556 now it obviously started to build up for
several weeks or whatever was cited all over the place but in order for us to do a proper analysis
we need a precise date we need something special here we need an earthquake and so we have one
here is a nice interesting reference because when the comet was seen in the sky somebody
did a woodcut of it and it says it's a german woodcut depicting an earthquake that occurred
two hours before dawn on the 10th of march 1556 and this is in istanbul in turkey a massive
earthquake very very notable so an earthquake and the comet that's the connection so let's have a
look at the sky then on the 10th of march top down view what have we got here satan seris and the sun
seris mars and the earth murkiv it's not quite it's an optimum but here's the interesting thing
about this if you go forwards over the next three days on the 11th 12 and 13th you get a series of
alignments that all become optimized okay but the 10th of march appears to be the date when
we have maximum energetic effect associated with the earth because that's when the earthquake
occurred okay so did jesus know about this alignment yes he did let me show you a very elegant
targeting which for me is utterly decisive this again is a nice summary from the birth of jesus
up to the death of john the baptist and that's how we got there you know we got there with the
7777 days to baptism minus eight days minus the circumcision event and then we went forwards
the seven times seven times seven times seven days to get to the death of john the baptist okay
so that's the final thing that we do after we've done the eight days back is that two four zero
one days to get to the death of john the baptist well let's remove this let's remove that final
thing so that we're just here we've gone back eight days well ladies and gentlemen this is the day
this is the day that you set in motion your calendar system to target the great cometer 1556
using cycles of 3200 days and in this case you you counter precise and very harmonious very
elegant 175 cycles so you're going to count precisely 560 000 days from the 29th of december
here okay and if you do that the day you drop on with absolute perfection is the 10th of march
the day of the earthquake a flawless targeting and so this is what you're getting from the gospels
you are getting jesus give you multiple future dates the re-encodes i haven't even gone into the
ones for the sixth century ad which started the dark ages you know but there's multiple alignments
like that and you can see that the parables and all that all these special adjustments are tied
into conjunction patterns associated like you know with when jesus crucified or when john the baptist
dies you know and you have all these adjustments and they all target certain dates in his own lifetime
and you set in motion these calendar cycles to target future days of disaster now i have shown you
these here and these are definitely future dates from the perspective of the time of jesus
you can't fake this you know what i mean the bible is already well established by
the 16th century you know what i mean so we know he was obviously dealing with the future
and seemed to know he had to have an astronomical model as good as the one we have with starry night
he had to know the physics of the sources this is why i say this is a high level advanced physics
knowledge here you know what i mean he just you can't fake this you know if somebody can tell you
the precise days of alignments uh you know in circa 2000 years ago when we are not even supposed to
know how to model the source system correctly we still think it's a geocentric thing some people
do anyway we haven't got elliptical orbits we haven't invented or discovered calculus we should not
be able to know no one should be able to know the precise dates of future alignments which don't
even involve the earth you can't even visually cite them accurately they involve planets aligned
without even the sun without even the earth and you're supposed to know that they accurately occur
to the day you know over a thousand years in advance this is literally impossible knowledge
and yet it's encoded in the bible you know so this is why jesus the mastermind behind this
storage was an absolute genius you know you can't fake this stuff so what i decided to do then
i know that we have this definite end of age alignment the 25 28 ad one 500 years from now
but when i studied all these alignments and i haven't shown you everyone i know
i'll just tell you as a summary you know um we get these kinds of destructive alignments every
few centuries and the last one i've just shown you is 50 and 56 okay so i'm thinking to myself i'm
genuine the thing i'm saying you know um i think that uh we're going to be in a situation where
we're pretty much due for one brand if we don't get an end of age alignment with some exotic
effects going off within the next 50 to 100 years i personally would be very very surprised
we only started to get really good in astronomy you know around about the very we're talking like
1800 or so you know past 200 years or so ago and we only officially discovered seris then so
we haven't had an end of age alignment i don't think since the 1556 event which again was kind of
mild we had the comet seris i think this was seris flaring up to develop cometary properties
we had that um we had that go on we didn't have any massive geophysical event except we had that
earthquake don't get me wrong we had something going on but it wasn't a massive tectonic plate
shift and floods going across hundreds of miles inland it wasn't that level and we did not get
a massive meteor bombardment so the damage is different every time we've been kind of lucky
but the 1556 was a bona fide end of age type alignment so for me the fact i don't think we've
had one since we're absolutely due for one so i decided to look at the solar system uh over the
next few decades to see if there's any interesting alignments and i'm going to show you two which
for me seem to be tied into the bible these are speculative by the way they're very speculative
they may be absolute nonsense but they're there there's these two here and there's one other
but i haven't got it in this presentation there's one other additional alignment in addition to
these two but these two are two of the best if somebody said keith gun to your head if we're
going to have an end of age alignment shortly in the upcoming next couple of decades one of the best
alignments that really make me think they could be eight the two i'm going to show you are the two
there's one i'm not going to show you but i'll i'll leave that from the presentation so again i'm
looking at tying into the parables of jesus so the first alignment i'm going to point to
it's the anchor point the first anchor point is the baptism day of jesus 6 of january 23 a d
go backwards 96 days okay very interesting now i'll just say a little aside by the way
do you know how you know when the uh the second jewish temple is destroyed uh tisha b'av
ninth of the month av which is 70 a d do you know how you do it you're on the baptism of jesus
you count forwards forwards 96 days and then you count 48 cycles of 360 days and you're
right on the day when the temple is destroyed jesus knew that too in this case we're going
backwards 96 days from the baptism of jesus this takes us to the 2nd of october 22 ad
then we start counting our special calendar cycle we're going to use 3200 days that's the unit this
jesus uses it a lot and in this case we're going to count forwards a very nice 230 cycles of 3200
days 736 000 days dead on from this date the 2nd of october and if we do that the day we
drop on with absolute perfection is the 5th of november 20 37 ad now you might not know this but
the 5th of november in britain is when we celebrate every year bonfire night oh and uh interestingly
enough uh it's called bonfire night because um it was on the 5th of november in 1605 when guy
forks tried to blow up the houses of parliament he was stopped at the last minute okay he had the he
had the gun 36 barrels of gunpowder underneath parliament and he was caught like just past
midnight or whatever 5th of november you know ready to light the fuse you know he got ratted out but
if he hadn't they've been caught the house of parliament here in britain would have been blown up
1605 5th of november and the reason i mentioned that is because in one of my youtube videos i point
out if you go backwards precisely 800 000 days from bonfire night and when i say 800 000 i mean that
exactly not a day more nor a day less 800 000 days back from the 5th of november 1605 you drop on
the day when the first jewish temple was destroyed precise day 9 av in the julian year 5 86 pc that's
another presentation don't you find it suspicious i don't want to get you sidetracked that both
temples fall on the same day oh yes this is one of the jewish traditions that they they actually
regard is a really bad like omen day nine av it's called tisha abav and that's when the the first
temple solomon's temple was destroyed and also the second temple was destroyed one's in 586 pc
and the other one is 70 ad but i found it fascinating that somebody attempted to bloke parliament
precisely 800 000 days after the the jewish temple was destroyed i thought that was fascinating
but this particular disaster alignment then i'm drawing your attention to i'm still occur then 2037
on the 5th of november so let's have a look at the solar system from a top down view on this precise
date and this is what we get we have a direct four body alignment of mars earth mercury and seris
whilst simultaneously an extra contributing conjunction of jupiter the sun and mercury now
reason why this is so significant let's have a look down the line of this four body alignment
it's aligned with the playities i mean the center seris mercury earth mars just like i think it's a
one and a half degrees of the playities and so it's rare a four body alignment like this with a
contributing conjunction involving jupiter and this elegant tie-in to the gospels makes me think
this is a contender it's speculative but it's an interesting contender makes me think on this day
could seris flare up to develop cometary properties could the planet start shaking could we see the
sun change you know i mean it's a contender you know it's an interesting one the the other
shot is from mars itself again if we position ourselves down the line you get seris the earth
and mercury there you go the line up very nicely almost equidistant from this viewpoint the pincers
of the scorpion okay now let's look at the next one this one here then this actually is jumping
from the fourth of november 1345 ad so this one here then is not directly from the stories in the
bible the stories in the bible get you to this day fourth of november um this is a revelation 12 one
so if we're here we can actually target another day which is close at hand another contender for
disaster in this case you know six times six times six is 216 days well if we go backwards
216 days okay from the fourth of november there's the julian day number we're then going to start
counting 80 cycles a very nice elegant number 80 times 3200 days which is 256 000 days dead on
and if we do that we drop on the sixth of march 2046 ad and this is when we have another
interesting alignment so let's have a look from a top-down viewpoint
there's the alignment it's two alignments offset from one another jupiter sun mercury seris
and jupiter venus and mars now why is this so significant well first let me just have a look
from the center jupiter all the way down the line just so you can see how accurate this is
there's venus and mars right near the head star of vergo interestingly enough and then we've got
seris and mercury there seris is well above the sun because of its ecliptic you know the
the way it's orbit is but they're very much aligned top down it's longitudinal crossings that matter
and then we've got the earth here okay separately so let's just have a look again let's have a
comparison this alignment here versus the 687 bc destructive alignment and there you can see the
comparison we know this was a disaster alignment here and it's jupiter venus and mars and then for
the one in 2046 we've got jupiter venus and mars and it's jupiter sun seris and then jupiter sun
seris mercury is also present in this one 6th march which just leads me on to compare the 2046
one to crucifixion day which is you remember when mercury was a part of it but the order was switched
jupiter seris sun mercury well it's jupiter sun and mercury is the other side just like that one
but seris is over here you know with the 33 ad one but again you can see that subtle similarity so
if we get the same kinds of alignments you know it makes you think maybe it's a contender i was
going to say do you think something's going to happen in 2046 do you what do you think is going
to happen well this is what i'm saying what i'm showing you here are two possible alignments
which they've got ties to this kind of mathematical system which is related to the parables of jesus
enough to hint that hey maybe they're there but they also have the same kinds of patterns
as prior alignments that we know have caused disaster okay and so you know four-body alignments
with contributing conductions line to the player d's you know or an alignment here which is again
is like a twin alignment involving jupiter there's a few more i could show you regarding jupiter
which you know that i think there was 1896 bc this was to do with the invasion of island and
another disaster and that involved jupiter venus and mars and jupiter mercury and seris as well
so there's a jupiter being aligned with two separate alignments offset from one another
the certain alignments like that have occurred in the past that is one of the most
significant types of patterns but again you're trying to just judge which ones are the special
ones and which ones are you know a bit too commonplace but as i said these are speculative
possibilities there's another one that occurs in 2041 ad but i got the slides as part of this
presentation but let me show you now something about geopolitics to do with the bible the
final bit and this is to the feeding of the 4000 another very interesting parable so the feeding
of the 4000 then let's have a look at the bible reference this is from matthew and again you're
looking at the numbers in the story so jesus is with his disciples and there's a great big massive
crowd with him and he's been with them for three days and everybody's hungry and so jesus says how
many loaves do you have seven they replied and a few small fish so he told the crowd to sit down
and he took these seven loaves and the fish and he gave thanks broke them gave them to his disciples
and they turned to the people he says if it's some kind of magical bag and he keeps pulling out you
know extra bread and fish and whatever but anyway after the disciples picked up seven full baskets
of broken pieces that were left over so they kind of start out with seven loaves and then they've got
seven baskets left over right and jesus is with these guys for three days and there's 4000 of them
so the answer you know the solution is you can ask yourself these all represent days by the way all
these numbers what is the mapping in time of this parable and what is it all about well let's have
a look at the next slide here this again is a summary and what i'm just going to show you again
is you know when we're at the birth of jesus and i say you go forward 7777 days to get to the baptism
but you know how i've also said to you you know we've had various corrections which are multiples
of six six times six times six is 216 okay well it's kind of interesting that if you keep multiplying
six by itself quite a few times five times you get the following and he's a little table for you to
consider six times six times six times six times six bottom line here 7776 okay now you will notice
here that which 7777 days okay to get to the baptism of jesus and we needed the four sevens
because we're going to multiply four sevens together to get that john the baptist connection
but it is also important to note that the day before baptism is also significant in terms of
multiples of six so that day before baptism is 7776 days after the birth of jesus so
if we go here then and just look at that so we're on the 6th of january he's baptized on the
sorry we're on the 5th of january jesus is baptized on the 6th so one day before we are
this number of days he's 7776 days after the birth of jesus okay so if we're here then let's have another
interesting backward correction involving the number seven in this case we're going to go back
777 days we love the number seven yeah we do and if we do as you can see we get to the 19th of
november and lo and behold lo and behold we have a lunatic eclipse what are the odds of a lunatic
a blood moon wow remember that story i was telling you about about the woman who was 12 years she's
been ill for 12 years with issues of the blood and this is an interesting point because if you
look in the king james bible it does literally say issues of the blood if you look in the new
revised standard edition it just says hemorrhages and i must admit hemorrhages loses something in
translation when you think hemorrhages you're thinking too modern and scientific but when
you see issues of the blood the minute you see the word blood you think blood red blood moon
lunar eclipse so i like the king james reference in that one because you are targeting a lunar eclipse
and the lunar eclipse here is also the anchor point of the feeding of the 4000
let's just show you here firstly the optimum lunar eclipse okay if we just adjust it from
12 noon we basically go to six hours 40 minutes so we've gone back five hours 20 minutes but we're
still on the 19th of november so this is the optimum alignment for the the full moon okay the
blood moon type thing and you can see it here in starry night we're in the center of the earth
and there is the blood moon and how interesting it's between the the pincers or the horns should
just say of torus okay because this is actually lined up to the galactic center area if we were
to go to the center of the moon and look we're going to be looking at the galactic center you
know between the sting of the scorpion area but before we do that then let's just have a top
down view of the solar system on this lunar eclipse day what wouldn't you just know it we've got some
very special alignments going off we've got the earth the sun and mars lined up and we've got the
earth mercury and ceris lined up very interesting alignments but let's just have a look from the
moon itself towards the galactic center this is what i say the direction of the eclipse is
significant the sun i've labeled it but you can't see it because it's behind the earth here and the
the earth here and the sun where are they right next to the foot of a fucus between sting of the
scorpion's tail shawla and also zisopentis how interesting okay very interesting so let's just
look at the mathematics now this year then we're the lunar eclipse here and we're in the 19th of
november 20 ad okay this is a lunar eclipse then which is 777 days prior to the day before the
baptism of jesus right the date that we're just looking at so
if you were on this date and you target you start a 3200 day calendar system going right
and you count 220 cycles of 3200 days the total number of days you'll be counting is 704 000 days
now remember this parable is called feeding of the four thousand the four thousand are the first
four thousand of the 704 000 right so three days prior to this date is the three days that jesus
with the people and four thousand days are the first four thousand days you know the four thousand
people the first four thousand days of this total here which is what you get when you multiply 220
by 3200 days now there are certain references in the bible to the number of temple servants in the
old testament and there are precisely 220 temple servants okay i think that's in the book of ezra
but don't quote me on that if you actually do go forwards then 704 000 days from the 19th of
november this precise lunar eclipse okay you actually target a date which is very much in
our own time okay it's got immense geopolitical significance the dating question is the 14th
of may 1948 this is when state of israel was reestablished right on this day okay jesus appears
to have known this it's incorporated into this the passage here the feeding of the four thousand
because if you were to count the four thousand people you'd have exactly 700 000 days very harmonious
you know we like the number seven it'd be 700 000 days uh to count the state of israel being
reestablished okay but let's just go further if we do just go the first four thousand days we get to
the second of november 31 ad so this is the completion of it right you know how we had seven laws of
bread and there were seven baskets left over seven times seven is 49 we add those on the end
baskets left over seven times seven and add it on the end we then go to the 21st of december
okay 21st of december right if we go forwards 49 extra days after the four thousand and we
have a special alignment let's have a look at it from the top down this is it we have a jupiter
venus mars alignment and also a seris sun venus alignment of sets it's very interesting again
it's the kind of alignment that makes me say ah yes that's correctly how to understand that's how to
correctly understand the parable it's um you go you know from the 777 days backwards you're the
beginning of the four thousand and then it's 49 days there and then you can see how we've got all
these special alignments targeting dates of great significance so here's how we get to another
interesting date towards a special lunar eclipse okay a very interesting date do you believe in
destiny yeah do you believe in destiny i i i don't know you know um i honestly i'm agnostic
however i do think these celestial bodies lining up uh can be predictable and can influence us i i'm
not going to act a fool and say well if the ocean tide is controlled by the moon to act as if some
celestial bodies don't have influence on us to me's you know obvious well well what i'm getting at
basically is about people being born on special days so do you believe donald trump is a man of
destiny i don't know well let me show you something very interesting about donald trump
this is his wikipedia page right and you can see it's locked because obviously everybody be
trying to update you know every second like you know so we can be confident because it's locked
we've got his date of birth dead on okay june the 14th 1946 this is just before the state of israel
you know it's just shortly before the state of israel was established which was in 1948
now we all know that donald trump seems to be a big fan of israel okay so here's an interesting
thing about donald trump and his birthday on the 14th of june this is modern day israel then 14th of
may 1948 okay so if we want to target the birthday of donald trump how many days do we go back and
the correct answer is 700 exactly 700 very interesting but there's more
there's something very special happening on donald trump's birthday
a lunar eclipse a blood moon and look at where it is located
we're at the center of the earth looking at the optimum and it's right next to the foot of a fulcus
right there galactic center alignment okay right on his birthday and it's 700 days prior to when
the state of israel was reestablished very very interesting i mean you know in the bible we went
backwards 777 days from one day before jesus's baptize and that's when we dropped upon the
lunar eclipse there okay on the 19th of november and that lunar eclipse was also targeting the same
area of the sky just at the the earth and the moon are reversed so we're at the center of the earth
here so we have to look to the moon and we find the moon blood red next to the foot of a fulcus if
we just have a look back at that the other one we have to be at the center of the moon and look to
the earth and if we do that that's when we see the earth next to the foot of a fulcus this is on
19th november 20 ad so it's the same direction in the sky and he's got that 700 day backward
motion from this day which seems to be targeted by jesus for when israel's reestablished and
so it makes donald trump's birthday the man himself you know really really significant this
i'll tell you it's it's fascinating see this is this is uh i'll give you an example and look
this is fascinating i really do think this is cool um i'm skeptical because we're factoring in
one guy you know what i mean yeah i know you mean yeah does this work for obama does this work for
bush does this work for hillary does this work and like i mean it's awesome if you do zero in on
what makes sense but when you look at like more you're like but what i do like about this is
i could see how celestial bodies yeah and they're they're lining up and the alignment of this
universe we live in influences us and maybe when you say destiny as someone who's more of a naturalist
so to speak this still can apply i mean look you don't have to think there's a guy floating in the
cloud somewhere looking down at you to believe that stars and have influence on humans i mean
and the way that we are and how we act as in my opinion has how we act as an advanced animal
i mean in my opinion i i think that we are uh personally i know that everybody has their own
little thing but i personally do think we did evolve but we're a higher species and regardless
we're influenced by outside you know things and i think that the stars and such may have their
influence on us and i don't i don't necessarily agree with Carl Sagan when he says that the celestial
bodies don't really have influence and that we we absolutely have our own destiny in our hands
because i'm not even certain we have absolute free will you know so there's a lot here that
we're influenced by other sources i think play a role but fascinating stuff though so far i mean
this is this is great because you can see we're technically if we learned this if we learn this
we can also predict technically if we learned how to do this we could predict the future in that
aspect if if uh these cycles are predictable yeah i do think that that is this what i'm saying
i think that it is possible to know something about the future in in special ways and in the
bible jesus appears to encode um destructive alignments that from a basic physics point of
view i mean you could actually say that a person scientifically if they knew which
planetary configurations can cause disruptions and they've had an accurate model of the solar system
they could make those forecasts in a scientific way and you wouldn't consider them prophecy to
be honest they'd be like a scientific thing but then when you start getting into the realm of
geopolitical events like knowing when a certain declaration in the un a body that doesn't even
exist you know two thousand years ago is going to be made and you know when people are going to
recognize a state being created that's when things start to get a bit strange and and i
admit that there's things like this but i don't wait to think that it's just the bible the you
know i talk about the jewish temples they appear to have been destroyed and again that's a geopolitical
event if you've got a critical day when a temple goes up in flames and you can also show that that's
tied into these calendar cycles you think wow um you know and and i could show you the presentation
on that as well because i've got that all nailed but this is why i say when i talked about the
house of parliament and somebody um attempting to uh blow them up and it turned out to be an 800
thousand day gap from when somebody actually blew up when uh the Babylon conquered um uh you know
Judah uh you know the Israelites um and destroyed the temple in 586 BC so there are some incredible
connections but i admit they all seem so isolated you know this they seem so isolated and you do
wonder because like with the people on earth there's like seven billion people so for me to just say
this is true for Donald Trump i know you could probably say well it could be true for like how
many other hundreds of people or whatever thousands of you know i mean so i get the point um yeah and
he is a world stage figure so he's socially a very important figure so in my opinion i've seen this
a lot and not just like with this particular thing but like like there are Christians who
what they've done and this is just my opinion okay um they look at the text and they say oh the
prediction of the end of times and or here's here's evidence from prophecy in the New Testament
that Donald Trump would come and then this this that and so so the way i personally uh because
i'm outside of fundamentalism i don't i don't yes i don't buy into some of their narratives
what they do but the closest i could get to prophecy for example is being able to track so
technically this is predictable with the right with the right knowledge it's predictable not only
in the celestial bodies but if you see let's just suppose like you've talked about this entire lecture
and i took notes and i said you know what you've talked about the two temples that went down on a
certain day because of certain bodies well those bodies will repeat those actions in the future
and i suspect that day another political um social political situation is going to occur
because somehow we humans are influenced by the celestial bodies the same way the moon affects
the tide on this earth in some social way as a species um that i can practically predict that
we're going to lose our our mind at one point and lose our emotional control and do something
that's going to be catastrophic to our own people like 9-11 or something that you just never know
what it might be but um that is where i could say hey i even spoke to Randall Carson a while back
i said Randall because we were talking about the great year and you know the great year being
this 24 to 26 thousand year span and i said is the cycles of the earth going through ice ages i
said can we predict is it have you done enough research possibly to predict when another ice age
can come based on the great year and some of these astrological you know examples and he says well
i'm working on it i would love to be able to determine how the earth is going to possibly
and when we might end up having another you know intense like crazy earth like change where we
end up back in an ice age or a super hot situation i don't know you know what i mean so i'm open to
the scientific parts um but getting into like i can predict the future based on me having a special
supposed special revelation just to me to god i think there's science behind it if you're going
to predict something i don't buy into the whole spiritual idea that's the canister fire trying
to avoid myself i mean i look for solutions like the ones i'm presenting here um and i'm not going
to tell you i'm a fundamental christian you know i am certainly not i'm a complete heretic
i mean i go into all kinds of aesthetic stuff um you know i'm into greek mythology and i do think
that all of these different cultures they are they're encoding the same astronomical patterns
by using like their own localized bespoke gods and heroes so it's the same esoteric knowledge
and you know they're trying to say the same sorts of things um i'm not even going to tell you i'm
that intimately familiar with christian doctrine at all i'm not i just look at the gospels i'm trying
to figure out as a mystery is it for me christianity essentially is a mystery religion and when people
get into controversy about well it was paul that kind of spread it all and i'm not really interested
in paul i've not read hardly any paul so i don't care about paul enough and paul but the only books
in the new testament that i really focused on now the gospels and revelation i'm not really that
interested in the others there's a lot of stuff in the old testament as well i think is kind of
it's off topic you've got you've got somebody who has taken a bunch of books and i do think that
they've been edited carefully and maintained over time and people have embedded they've
they've basically embellished history so we can say for example yeah there's a there's a real exodus
event a real event uh yeah real flood event but then when you start talking about uh the flood
event and um Noah's ark and it gives you just a basically rectangular box type object with three
dimensions well we don't know what the ark is but what i do know is you're supposed to multiply
those three numbers together you get in four i think it's 45 uh four so 480 no i don't know 450
thousand days and you're supposed to go forwards in time from a certain day associated with the date
of the the ark you're sorry the the disaster alignment and you target another alignment i've
got that all in another work so i know what they're trying to do they're they're basically
embellishing it's like center cherub's army yes real army real siege no problem but 185
thousand men an embellished figure because it's trying to tell you that's the interval of time
between the destruction of that which is associated with an alignment there and another alignment
just at the close of the 1200 1200 bc x 11 93 so this is the kind of stuff that you've got going
on in the bible you've got a kind of a core history but you've then got people embedding
numbers in the stories which are also with calendar corrections that do encode the dates of significance
for geophysical events that are with astronomical events in the solar system
which can cause a destruction and also geopolitical events that we kind of would classify as prophecies
you see some this is an prophesying event politically will occur you think you can't
you know you don't necessarily think you can figure that out from the planets as such um
but you do think yeah physically we should be able to work out the science of resonant
harmony with respect to the solar system and we should be able to figure out these disasters in
a kind of pure scientific way you know in terms of the physical side of destruction to the solar
system but it's like the same kinds of things can be tied into political events and that's
where we start to say hey the guy that knows this somehow knows the future they know something
very advanced i've heard it said that back in the ancient world um the the stargazer if you will
the magi so to speak just to give an example who knew the stars um this which usually were priests
this this was people that they saw as obviously able to predict prophecy etc um the gods would
tell them or god would tell them and the common folk would come to them knowing these guys knew
something they didn't and they thought wow they're really having this direct like this unique relationship
with the one true or our god and i think that these guys knew some science and math and had
predictable outcomes and some of them obviously became false prophets because some things didn't
happen and they must have not had math right or whatever but i i wonder if that that's where
this is going and one of the things i'd like to see and not like what we hear all the time with
people you know we've heard um for example i'm sure you've talked about nostradamus if you're into
esotericism stuff and things you probably do discuss but i would be very interested in seeing
someone today right i would like i would be very interested in seeing someone today
like flat out not like we hear with the christians today who are you know all the end of the world
has to happen because jesus says well first of all i don't think it ever was talking about the end of
the actual world i think this is just cycles and ages etc but yeah but um the i'd like to see someone
on on like a big stage come in and say listen and not all crazy hocus pocus you know john the
baptist eating honey and locus okay just a guy who's scientific maybe modern thinking he says listen
there's there is a calculation there is an actual science to this that encompasses everything as
us as a species to everything we know and i can predict that on this day there is going to be a
political catastrophe not enough funny like hocus pocus way because of the way that we are connected
to the world we live in and everything from the harmony of this earth to the other we're one with
this earth we can't leave the environment we're in we are influenced and affected from everything
from the magnetism to if the earth is having a heartbeat so are we and i honestly believe that
it goes through phases and when it goes through phases we inevitably go through phases and that
is where i think someone's going to come along and if they can tap into this and see something here
if it's there i say that for those who are skeptics to predict something and it happens you know you
know what you have just said there it strongly makes me think of a certain thread of research
i've gone down and there's a lot of stuff i've not shown you but do you know how i mentioned
and i think we're all familiar you know occultists somewhere have you when they are
they want to do their ceremonies they want to do it on a special time when the planets are innocent
because they think that they will be able to achieve their ends if they do things at certain times
well people seem to pick wittingly or unwittingly days to do things to engage in actions and
they basically commit themselves to engaging in an action which may or may not be successful and
this is why i said here the connection between the destruction of the jewish temple the first one
i think it wasn't a nebuchadnezzar i think it was it 586 bc they came in the guy destroyed the
temple he did it when he did it under the hebrew calendar on nine aft and tisha but aft 586 julian
right he did that 800 000 days dead on later 5th of november 1605 guy fox is there tinderbox 36
miles of gunpowder underneath parliament ready to set the whole thing that's the day he picked
he was caught red-handed the event never blew up parliament but the day was picked you know in the
united states robert kennedy was assassinated and he died and i think was it was it the sixth of
june it's 1968 i think it was the sixth of june i did a presentation on this on my youtube channel
so i looked at this okay if you're on the right the precise day when robert kennedy dies he doesn't
die straight away only shot i think it's about 24 hours later something he dies i think it's i
think it's on the sixth of june you're on that precise date start counting 360 day years count
13 cycles of 360 days which is 4680 days i believe what day do you drop on with absolute perfection
the very day somebody attempts to assassinate ronald reagan do you remember that i think it's
1980 or 81 or whatever it's it's the very that hinkley guy you know the guy that comes out of
nowhere and fires seven shots out of a six-shot revolver you know that guy yeah yeah we're seven
sure but anyway this talk about another bullet being fired but reagan he was hit and he was really
touching go but he survived but the attempt was made and there's a you see how robert kennedy
attempt was and he was successful and nothing that sir and sir and did it you know but you know
well once you want to mind control but the bottom line is the attempt was made to assassinate the
presidential candidate there robert kennedy the attempt was made against reagan they tied
together mathematically by these these calendar cycles one is successful the other is not and this
is why when it comes to like forecasting precisely things sometimes you can only forecast the date
when something big is going to be attempted you can't necessarily know the outcome it could flip
a switch it goes one way another you know what i mean it's very funny you say this because i just
did an interview with someone and he's into the mayans okay big time like i'm talking
he he understands the 20 day cycle and 36 deacons i don't know this stuff that well we just went
through one episode where he was explaining and he's like listen he said i don't even the mayans
and and they've taught him he's like you could literally go into a coma for 50 years wake up
and not have to observe the heavens all right knowing what they teach you about about animals
about people and the social structure around us and you can tell what day you are in in the calendar
based on what is going on in the environment with people animals etc he said that social influence
has been something that they've been able to predict and base it off of their time in their
calendar now i would love to link you up with him sometime to discuss these matters because
if you can predict the actions of people by behaviors as a species based on this tells me
we're connected more to everything around us than what we necessarily be told so technically
how free can you really be in terms of yeah yeah you know i think i was in the corpus hermetically
talk about as being a trapped within the cosmic framework but somehow a master of it you know
influences us but we can we have the power to break free or you know act you know in some way
sovereign over the influences of the celestial powers you know it's it's something like that
so i think this is the kind of the mystery of sovereignty for people and the very word sovereign
means above the law if you are above the law you you're creating you set it in motion you just got
to wonder if the laws of a certain celestial powers and certain energies are present but we
have something within us we can command which is of a higher power we can override lower laws
lower influences if you see what i'm saying yeah you you you ask me an important question do i
believe in destiny people ask me all the time do you believe in god they ask me this okay
okay and i cannot answer them saying yes based on already knowing what they mean when they say
yes do you believe in god you see when i said to you when i said to you do you believe in destiny
i don't want you to misunderstand me i did not mean that to be synonymous with do you believe in god
and or something yet right yeah so technically technically i'm very even though i'm not certain
right i'm not educated enough to know these things not on the level you do with the mathematics here
and understanding times and such and whether i you know i'm skeptical of some of the timings that
you've discussed even though they're plausible explanations you're trying to make sense of
something i'm only skeptical because i've not dealt it's not something i've chewed on it's not
it's not beef jerky that i've chewed on for a while so it takes me time to digest ideas
because i used to just hook line and sink or believe everything and now i'm very cautious
but i investigate and you've opened the door for me to consider more knowledge on this
plus i'm going to be having randall carlson on the show here not too long from now so
there's going to be more catastrophe and influences like this being discussed
when you asked me do i believe in destiny i can't help as a human but to look within myself sometimes
and feel there is something bigger drawing me in directions and making me feel influenced
whether it's my own consciousness whether it's my you know whatever you'd like to call it i
don't care for definitions do i think that i'm here on for a purpose for a reason yes
if that's what you mean by destiny do i think there's ways of predicting things to come
yes i'm not going to guess that i know for for sure why all i can do is is the next right thing
help the next person be the best person that can be so i i appreciate the question too because
you know i don't know but um with that being said i think we're getting close to the end are we not
yeah yeah i just as i said with regards to say randall carlson's work the the thing about it is
yeah i understand we're saying about procession okay and i this is one i have a chapter on procession
in my book where i talk about the binary theory of procession which i believe is correct and i
actually show these um some of the cycles associated with it but here's the thing about a
lot of researchers that talk about procession okay they talk about it as just the cycle itself of the
say the sun you know rising through different zodiacal star systems over 25,770 years they view
it seemingly as an abstraction what i want to reinforce here with the alignments that i've been
showing here is when i talk about alignments say and i say hey there are certain special
directions in the sky like with the Pleiades like with the galactic center stars because
these are very far away background stars the alignments take into account procession so you're
not just looking at procession as an abstract cycle of 25 000 years you have got to isolate
the very precise conjunction patterns which line up with certain precise directions in the sky
with certain constellations and you've got to look at the cycles of those alignments
and this is why the the core misty pattern i was showing you with the uh the galactic alignment of
Mars Venus Sun Mercury and Sun Earth Pleiades one that one there when i'm showing you this i'm saying
look this occurs you know on a certain cycle a gap of 1183 years 1430 sorry 1400 to 1343 years
another 1183 years and then a 788 years so it keeps on repeating that exact pattern and obviously
that is going to be a part of procession it's going to be a part of it but the procession itself
as a the cycle of you know 25 000 years the completion of one processional cycle just ticking
that over it doesn't mean anything in and of itself as such it's all about the conjunctions that
take place with background stars which you're obviously having to take procession into account
with if that makes sense so technically you got a whole pie the whole pie could be the the whole
great year what they do what makes up the pie though are the slices in the ingredients and the
ingredients is what you're discussing here and why that's vital you got you get the great year when
you look at what the ingredients are and something that i think is important you mentioned in here
and i think this does tie into the big pie picture of the great year is the ages these ages are very
significant on what i think there are 12 months in this great year so to speak and their ingredients
to this thing that these ages that jesus is saying the end of the age is right here this
generation is ending this age and they're moving from one zodiacal sign processionally into another
one i suspect so it's a very complex system and this is why it i know people talk about ages like
of yugas and they they somehow split up it's like with a processional cycle they split it up
into to 12 parts or whatever and they talk about them like that that for me is it's so basic
it's it's almost irrelevant because as i said we we have a complex series of end of age alignments
of different types there's only one pattern that i've identified as being a recurring pattern
which is that special alignment you know i've mentioned that is the template and it's the
instances of that alignment there are the core or the key anchor point dates to set in motion
calendar systems to target variance destructive alignments that occur in between it and i've never
found one other configuration of an exact same type which i can say yeah um i've got the cycle of
that second pattern nailed as well i know precisely i've only got one cycle nailed on exactly there i
know occurs you know with a certain pattern to it the other conjunctions i mentioned here
they're all uniquely separate and distinct i i don't know when they occur again if you
know what i'm saying and so this is why the pattern for me is so much more complicated
and the explanations i've seen you know other people give would talk about processional cycles
they're so basic for me they they've not really cracked the mystery at all they're dealing with
something that's just too abstract it's not about just saying one processional cycle is
25700 years let's split you up into half or a quarter or you know it's not that you've just
got to look at the individual unique conjunction patterns which occur lined up to the stars
you know as they do in a complex pattern and procession is taken into account because you're
taking into account background stars but the system has no necessarily no basic that's why
that's and that's why you're right because and it strips away predictability too when they go
that basic so one of the things i think is interesting you bring up and this is why i asked
mr carlson is can we predict another ice age and i think it'd be interesting to know
if we could but you can if you're sitting here the answer is the answer is this this is the thing
about ice ages remember when i talked about one of those alignments in five sorry it was a 3900 bc
event the intense aridization event this is what geologists have figured what they basically say
for some reason everything got really hot on the earth it was it was a sustained intense heat
deserts expanded and this effect lasted for several centuries now i would say that the effect was
abruptly triggered by the alignment pattern that i i noted which caused a sudden but fundamental
change in the energy output of the sun we then have to wait for another alignment to occur
which causes another kind of sudden change in the sun so that it drops and so when you think about
things like ice ages i would be saying something similar we need to know it they'll usually unless
we're talking about these melanchovic cycles which is also with subtle changes in the elliptical
orbits but we're not talking about that we're talking about conjunction patterns okay and when
we're talking about these kind of world age esoteric cycles they may be abruptly triggered
and then last for several centuries say maybe a few thousand years and then another type of
alignment will occur which will change the energy output of the sun say and there's something else
will change so and ice age if it's in terms of forecasting one could if you knew the precise
configurations which would trigger it cause a decrease in energy output of the sun and you knew
that this was going to last for several centuries until it was modified again you know you could
forecast them if you had that level of precise physical knowledge you know what i mean that's
the kind of thing went after but that's way beyond i think what pelson is looking at because i think
he's looking at these gradual cycles from when i gather i don't think he's looking at conjunctions
triggering sudden events like that i i just i think that is not going in a direction that's a good
question i'm not certain if he's taking the same approach like you are i know that he does talk about
how uh he thinks an asteroid obviously or some type of comet or something struck us at some point
to you know 12800 900 years ago but i know shock rubber shock he believes that there were pulses
from the sun it it it had obviously you know given off solar flares that caused an extreme
amount of heat to the earth which put us into a melting of the ice age and 400 feet rise to the
oceans and and and like i said all these things are outer influences and we get so caught up in
our world to think that there is no influence from the outer you know this is why and people
even victor club and bill nape have looked at that and when you look to the work of the tolemans
and i talked about they talked about a a meteor strike in uh of certain fragments hitting us in
seven uh seven thousand six hundred and forty bc and then we had the work of an asteroid impact
you know hitting the Mediterranean 31 50 bc well the physical evidence for those things
but here's the critical thing it was exactly the same alignment pattern present which was
responsible but how it was responsible was by this manner you're talking about the planets
like venus and mercury developing cometary properties igniting spewing off material massive
long trains and also blasting off even with energetic effects like electric universe type stuff
you can blast material off hot spots that form so what we had was what the material that hit us it
wasn't like uh a you know just a fragment that came in from deep space from orbiting the earth
also orbiting the sun for millennia and just happened to hit us no no it was newly blasted off
of one of the planets when they developed these cometary properties and so it's the the planets
themselves print a resin agitation and what's responsible when they blast off material and
we get some of these significant fragments which hit us that's what caused these meteor
bombardments like in 10,964 bc you know that's what caused it but at the same time sometimes
we might get just caught in a cometary stream of more small particles like in 1345 ad we didn't
have a massive bombardment of material and then like you've just said there one of the things
that people talk about is the sun itself when we talk about energetic changes being sudden
that could again be like a spherical shell of energy you know flaring off the sun
again triggered by certain alignments and so it's almost like one of these weird like I think somebody
is called the micronova but it's an energetic impulse and that also might bombard the earth
and cause these like light show in the sky which also might be quite toxic as well so
there's things like that and I do think that these effects will you know they can also modify the
energetic state of the planet that affect the broad mood of all of humanity and there what's
responsible for changing like the the emotional state of people the intellectual state of humanity
again it's bursts of energy all triggered by conjunctions these are the most subtle effects I
mean I've just looked at some of the crude destructive effects but there's elements of
how it affects personality and geopolitics which is like way above my pay grade you know
you know what I mean but I like the way you phrased it and I think we're on the same page
brother I really do I figure we're let's wrap this one up because we can do more of these and
how do they get a hold of you um yeah my book uh is a cult physics and my website is also
occultphysics.com so if you're interested in my book uh you can get it there um
that's my website occultphysics.com basically I'll put it down in the description you guys
click the link yeah uh and the this is on my website and they also in the tab of my videos
I've kind of compiled a bit of a list of some of the videos I've done from my youtube channel
they're all accessible in order via my website where I show some of these slides but um not as
advanced as I think some of this stuff I'm still I've got quite a lot of slideshow presentations
you know and they deal with many areas there's many great mysteries to do with like you know the
Sumerian king lists and the Barossa said I've totally cracked that one oh snap we might have to
have that one on the show because I'm I'm into that you know oh yes I have cracked that one um
I was like proud of that that was just several months ago uh sometimes I do the slideshows and
then I I might delay ages before I actually um do them for my youtube channel because it takes
a long time editing them but well let's let's do if you get your slideshow and you're good
we'll do a show we'll do another one on that I really appreciate you joining me here and
this was fun it was it was a change up from just the historicity talks of of mythology
and a variety of different things I really appreciate it brother so I hope to see you
come back on here again okay then right sir yes sir and don't forget we are myth vision
