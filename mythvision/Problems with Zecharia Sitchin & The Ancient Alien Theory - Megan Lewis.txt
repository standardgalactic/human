Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Megan Lewis what are some problems with the ancient aliens maybe we can talk
about Sitchens and just the ideas in general we won't necessarily need to get like stuck
on like you know some type of extraterrestrials floating out there but like the basis is supposedly
Sitchens is reading this ancient Sumerian and he has interpreted that these extraterrestrials
create humans to mine the earth of minerals to go to their spaceships oh yeah yeah so
but tell us maybe some problems with it also how he got things wrong sure so ancient aliens
first generally especially if you're familiar with the history channel show people who subscribe
to these theories generally cherry pick their evidence and misrepresent what they do take
so quite often especially on the show you'll have people presented as experts who have
little to no training formal or otherwise in the field that they're purportedly an expert
in you have people speaking wildly outside of their own their own actual training and
then you have the evidence they present is very poorly they lie essentially I was trying
super hard not to say that but they lie and there's one episode that I like I went through
and method method a lot methodically that's the word methodically like checked out and
like the sites that they use they're using either outdated information or they're completely
ignoring archaeological reports that tell you information that we know and it's just presented
as like this huge big sparkly mystery and it must be aliens like no actually or they
look at something and they claim that it's far earlier in time than it actually was and
when you go back and look at the actual evidence like there's very good evidence to date it
to much much later in time so just like a couple of small issues that you often see with with
that kind of material and one overarching problem that you do have to keep in mind is that a
lot of the time these theories are rooted either consciously or otherwise they're rooted
in a kind of white supremacy racist mindset the general sense is that white people didn't
make these structures if you think specifically about things like the pyramids the ziggurats
of Mesopotamia and of Mesoamerica white people didn't do them white people weren't doing
these kinds of amazing things at a comparable time period therefore indigenous people brown
people black people could not have done these at the time that history that archaeology
says they did so it must have been aliens okay completely ignoring the fact that especially
if you look at Egypt we have records of how like specifically instructions of how they
made the pyramids we have like super clear records of that kind of thing we know archaeologists
historians know how people build things when they did it why they did it very well documented
no no aliens if you look specifically at Mesopotamia Zachariah Stitchin is probably the most famous
proponent of alien theories he wrote a series of I think twelve books or something looking at
a multitude of different evidence looking at mythology and archaeology and cylinder seals
and imagery and all kinds of stuff that he very neatly kind of ties in a bow and says oh well
the gods the gods in Mesopotamia weren't actually gods they were aliens who came to earth essentially
created humanity created civilization and used us as miners to mine for gold to power their spaceships
okay aside from the quite obvious problems that I would have as an historian with people looking
at texts that are very clearly mythological allegorical etiological and taking them as
straight-up history even with texts that you could consider history or historical you do not
take them at face value ever that's just that's like reading an email composed by Trump's campaign
manager and saying oh this must all be a hundred percent truth hundred percent historical fact
I mean equally it doesn't matter what side of the aisle you sit reading an email from Biden's
campaign manager it's a hundred percent true hundred percent historical no people frame things
people choose the information they share with you for a very specific reason just because it's written
down doesn't make it true doesn't make it history like it's just not how things work
and that's essentially what Sitchin does he takes texts that are very clearly literary very clearly
stories and says well this is this is either straight-up history or this is
like an allegorical retelling of alien battle or how spaceships landed in Mesopotamia
which is is fascinating just from an intellectual standpoint but really doesn't bear any
it doesn't have any bearing in in like reality or at least the historical reality that we can
uncover and something that we're often asked and I get an email about this maybe once a month
asking did Sitchin know Sumerian or was he just a fraud which is actually a really complicated
question in his books he does go into an awful lot of detail about like I said specific myths
looking at the Sumerian language and if you didn't know any better you'd assume that he
knows how Sumerian works and he can read Sumerian or he could he sadly passed away but or that he
could read Sumerian now whether or not he could is honestly difficult to answer Sitchin was writing in
like the early 19th century yes sorry I get the centuries mixed up in the 1900s
so 20th century yes not the 19th century thank you yeah this is this is why we have you here
it's okay don't worry when I'm wrong I promise you you'll know it but he was he was writing in
like 1900 he was born in 1920s and a seriology really isn't that old of a field like we haven't
been around for very long Sumerian and Akkadian weren't deciphered like hundreds of years ago
like classical Greek and Greek and Latin were even even Middle Egyptian so the field has been
moving very very fast as people research it as we learn more about the texts about how grammar
works really intricate stuff it advances our knowledge super super fast so he was working
really kind of early in in the in the disciplines history so his knowledge of Sumerian just
factually would not be as complete as say my knowledge having been educated like in in the
past decade because we've had so many advances in in the field so it is entirely possible therefore
that he was reading the texts with the information that he had available to him at that point in time
and he honestly thought that the readings he was coming up with were accurate I find that unlikely
but I wish to be generous and I obviously never met the man so I can't say definitively oh yes he's
100% Charleston the problem that you have when you look at his his understanding of Sumerian is that
he doesn't seem to really have any kind of grasp of how the grammar works so
Sumerian makes verbs by essentially stringing syllables together to make verbal what we call
verbal chains so you have the verb usually located at the end of that chain so we'll say
do three is the verb which means to build and the three just means that it is the third
cuneiform sign with the phonetic value do there are loads of of cuneiform signs that mean do
they all have different syntactic values so do three means to build and you see there's a lot
in royal inscriptions I the king for this particular god built this temple I do read this temple
it just means I built this temple for this god so in front of the verb you have other cuneiform
signs other syllables that give you information kind of like conjugation a verbal conjugation
it'll tell you like the the tense it'll tell you the person whether it was like first second third
person I did it you did it he did it whether it's one or two like I did it we did it that kind of
thing so if you look at the verb garand do three it's a very specific verb it is a verb it means
let me build you've got do three at the end we know that that means to build gar is the
cohortive marker it means let me so let me build an an is is a like the person marker
so pretty straightforward right good the problem is that gar an also by themselves
can be taken as nouns the verb the the word gar the sign for gar can also mean milk
interesting cool the sign on can also mean a specific god the sky god or it can just be a
like a marker of divinity it goes before a specific god's name to let people know that
you're talking about a divinity or it can just mean god so what Sitchin would do if he was
confronted with this verbal form he wouldn't take it as a verb necessarily or at least not the
conjugation that the eye would or that that josh would he would say milk sky milk god one of the
readings of an is there's also sky so he'd say milk sky build it's the milky way which is really
interesting but it's not what is written in Sumerian it's not what that Sumerian means especially in
whatever context you might find it in and you see this quite a lot in in in his writing I don't
have specifics because it's been a while since I read the books but I remember that his his reading
of the word that he thought was like a rocket ship included the words it was a
it was like a verbal form that contained the word for dagger which he thought looked would look like
a rocket like a silver rocket flying through the sky which is fascinating and super inventive but
it's not what that means and again it's entirely possible he genuinely thought that he was translating
accurately it's also possible he just had a really interesting story and felt like making some money
off selling alien books yeah that's interesting there's a lot the whole and you said uh
I mean just this whole idea that he thinks the gods what I think is interesting about the story is
that the gods are always depicted as up in the sky and if they did come down well there there's
aliens right and the funny thing I think about it is citizens is coming up in a time in which
there is this phenomenon of extraterrestrials coming up on the scene like nobody's talking about
this in the 1500s nobody's like oh the aliens are coming like fiction is now playing a huge role
you've got a lot of people talking about other creatures from other planets coming in in the
writing fictional stories and and it's in the air it's in the milieu absolutely and like I'm the
biggest science fiction nerd I love it I love stories about aliens I love like Star Trek
beautiful fantastic makes me very happy but trying to then map that onto a very human past
specifically and I people are going to roll their eyes at this but specifically a past
populated by primarily black and brown people is kind of it's a little uncomfortable if we're
very honest because no one is looking at Stonehenge and saying oh well aliens it's it's taken as red
really that that that was the product of humanity and it's an amazing monument and an amazing feat
of engineering and transporting that rock from like Wales down to southern England whoa that's
fantastic no one questions that as the mark of or as the the achievement of a white European
nation or people group because it wasn't wasn't a nation as a white European people group
but you look at the pyramids fantastically to engineering beautifully made
wonderful and the not the immediate assumption but a very strong assumption for many many people
is that oh it couldn't have been built by humans it must have or at least not the humans who were
living there it must therefore have been aliens or the massive stones in Rome building of their
temples there are some stones that are ridiculous I mean and the Rome I mean people would say well
they were very in you know they were just super intelligent yeah but uh here you can't allow
the pyramids it's just too much right um I have my like I have family that thinks aliens a lot right
now they don't consciously think the way that you describe right and I'm not I'm not trying to say
that people who holds all people who hold to ancient national theories are inherently racist
definitely not what I'm saying I think they're mistaken for sure yeah absolutely and um I do
think that it is interesting to think about why these theories are placed on the regions the
geographical regions that they are placed upon and why like you said we don't see them with
classical civilizations we don't see it with like the Norse I deliberately or otherwise it is my
opinion there's a very strong racial component there um and this is not like I haven't spent
a ton of time researching this if people are interested there are fantastic scholars and
researchers actively working on like debunking ancient alien theories and saying look this is
why it's wrong um and I can give you details of those for the the description of people are interested
um but finally one one massive problem with ancient alien theorists and with debunking
ancient alien theories is that the people who come up with these pick information from all over
the civilization that they're working with which is really difficult then for academics to debunk
because when you're an academic typically what you do is you have a very narrow focus as your
own personal specialty you look at one thing in one time period or one thing across some time periods
um you don't say research uh cylinder seal iconography and Sumerian literature um and
Mesopotamian building practices you might have a knowledge of them but you can't or you don't
feel comfortable talking in depth about all of those things so being able to debunk theories that
draw very heavily on all of those aspects you need either a very wide knowledge or you need
several different people to work with you which is is is very tricky and it means that when
academics are approached with alien theories they can obviously debunk most of it but then
at least when I do it there are a couple of things I'm like look I know this isn't right
I can't right now present you with evidence for why it's not right give me some time I'll go away
find something um but then the responses are well ha you can't prove me wrong right here right now
therefore I'm right I think it's interesting too in light of what you say you know they're jumping
from oh we'll go from Giza then we're in Malaysia then we're in South America like that and it's
like whoa do you know how many different real experts in those particular fields you would have
to have yeah to properly assess this and all you have is a guy with a drone who has a lot of money
backed up by a documentary series on tv who's flying it over and they have a little tribal
guy who has a myth that he can come on and go you know long ago my ancestor said and it's like
ooh and then the myth is sold yeah and they make it as aliens but what I found interesting I think
I saw a youtube video where someone was doing a doc like a response debunking some of this
and he's like half of the time I don't have a number but let's just say like half the time
these sites that they love going to where they go in the mysteries of this and that
like a hundred feet over there there's a quarry and there's some tools that we have found in that
quarry that are human tools to show you just so you know they actually made this yeah there's no
reason to say aliens came down and use the resources here to try and find a way to in Egypt we have
pictures showing them constructing the two the pyramids like we we know how they did that it's
it's not a secret in Mesopotamia we have like reliefs carved images of people in a quarry
making these giant statues like people making them not not aliens making them and another thing
that the ancient astronaut theorists love to do is like find things that look kind of the same
all over the world and say oh look this is the same and this and this and this and this
and the obvious one is is with pyramids like there are pyramids shaped structures in a lot
of different civilizations um it's like coincidence I think not oh actually pyramids are just one of
the easiest shapes to build they're the most stable structures you can make if you feel like
making a giant monument like if you give a toddler a bunch of bricks odds are at some point they're
going to build a pyramid because they won't fall down again it it's not that weird and if you're
looking at things like iconography and you're picking out in different civilizations the same
imagery well that's not terribly surprising if you look at like the different modern cultures
most of us have some kind of like human shaped doll figure that we give to small children to play
with is that a sign of aliens no it's a sign that we like making representative toys for our kids
and in that best I mean let's suppose um that going far enough back that uh somehow we we learn
and taught these things and this is just passed down I don't know if there's any pre ice age
potential to someone knowing anything I don't know that's totally speculative but I just say
it's like you don't need to add the ad hoc proposition to be true I do think this is an
interesting discussion um what do you know they would probably as apologist I'm using this analogy
they would probably run and go well okay we'll grant that humans were cutting the stones but
to move them it takes anti-gravity technology or some crazy and then what is the symbol on the
wall and then they'll say doesn't that look like some type of light beam for I mean there's just
so many things I've heard like where the pyramids are placed on earth that place has healing potential
or like energy levels and like it's like like they're arranged along ley lines or you can like
if you have a picture of the world you can like draw lines between the pyramid of course you can
it's straight lines like from one point to another you can make it a straight line it doesn't mean
anything um yeah it's and I see why people do it we really love seeing patterns and stuff and it's
it's interesting but I think it's much more interesting and much more exciting that actually
you consider the fact that ancient cultures were that amazing they were that intelligent their
engineering was that advanced that they could make things like this um I couldn't make a giant
pyramid I wouldn't know where to start and it just they made these beautiful monuments and
we go ahead and ascribe it to aliens in the sky I was like no humans are amazing and inventive
we're super cool just just accept that I saw meme and we'll end on this if that's with you
maybe you could comment on it is what I'm saying um the two there's like videos that go viral and I
can't stop watching them when I see them two little brown skinned South American men with sticks
literally sticks in a bucket maybe and they go to this little spot in the middle of the jungle and
they start cutting holes in the ground and they start shaping it and then they start digging this
little like I mean it looks like some Aztecian type of underground like vacation spot with its own
little pools and sod and like slides into have you ever seen any of those I haven't but like indigenous
knowledge is like really impressive like just what indigenous peoples can do with the lands that
they they were born into and it's really cool and the ancient people were the same
the people are really clever I'm not really clever I couldn't do that
they can because they have the knowledge and they've been taught how to do it
you
