when i really scrutinize your phd skills again so they're making it not true it's not true just
not true it's false and we don't fault yeah demons demons i'm gonna show it you're gonna show this
not much to show all you have to do i mean like anybody who does any research at all can show
that's not true it's just not true join mythicians patreon today
we are myth vision welcome back to myth vision podcast dr bartierman how are you my friend
i'm doing well thanks classes have ended so life's good that's always good uh you are the
james a great distinguished professor at unc chapel hill you've written countless books literally
your newest one coming out is on the book of revelation but uh i've loved your work your
works on audible you've educated probably millions of people across the world and i just
want to say thank you for what you do thank you thank you for that uh you you can count the books
they're not that many oh i gotta pretend you know there are plenty and you're still writing and
and there's always something to learn and keep learning so thank you for joining us again here
at myth vision i have a very good friend who wants to remain anonymous that uh helped me in the questions
and making this video possible so i want to say thank you to my secret batman you are awesome
um so dr airman let's start with the first question we'll just dive in because i feel
like what we're going to be doing today is testing your phd skills again wow okay bring it on i know
right like you look forward to every one of these so i'll read the question and um we'll go from there
since there are no uh there are no major manuscripts of the new testament books that
are dated earlier than about the third century how can scholars be certain that what they have
represents what was written in the original autographs it would it would have been possible
during the interval to insert edits or change passages to reflect changing theological views
of the leaders without later scholars knowing it is known for example that marcian during the 140s
came out with an edited version of luke the earliest complete manuscripts do not contain
the longer version of mark 16 and john's story of the woman taken in adultery suggesting this
editing process continued into at least the mid 300s and beyond that's the question uh yeah well
okay we could spend an hour on this one it's a complicated question if you're asking how can we
be certain if you mean absolutely certain beyond a measure of a doubt the answer is no we can't be
absolutely certain beyond a measure of the doubt we do have um um we do have many many more manuscripts
of the new testament than for any other book from the ancient world uh that's not that that's not
strange because the most of our manuscripts come from come from the middle ages and in
europe in the middle ages the people copying book for christian monks and they're more likely to copy
the writings of paul than the plays of plautus you know they're just not going to come i mean
not that interested in plautus frankly and so uh so we have more manuscripts and so that that part's
good but you're right we don't have manuscripts we start we start having little fragmentary
manuscripts in the second christian century so the earliest one maybe is earliest 30 or 40 years
after the original john it's this little fragment a piece of a size of a credit card we don't start
getting sizable fragments till around the year 200 uh around 200 we start getting uh we've got a
manuscript of some of the gospels that are for example that are uh fragmentary they're missing
pages but you know they're there and then we don't get complete manuscripts until the fourth century
and so the question is you know we can tell pretty well how the texts are copied after that
because we have lots of manuscripts but how do we how do we know that it was copied accurately
prior to that and um we don't know for certain but there are there are pretty good levels of
probability that we are we basically know what these authors wrote and uh scholar the scholarship
that's devoted to this is the technical term is textual criticism it's a term that many people
misunderstand people think the textual criticism means like interpretation of the text and it
doesn't mean that it does not mean that it's a field it's it's a term that's used in every field of
literary studies it's in Shakespeare or Chaucer or Plato or whatever where you try to reconstruct
what the author wrote based on your surviving manuscripts that's it so every field has this
prior to the invention of printing all you had were handwritten copies so the deal is the reason
that you can be reasonably sure that you're pretty close is because suppose in the year 400
you start getting manuscripts by the year 500 you say you get you know 100 manuscripts in the
year 500 well those those manuscripts didn't appear out of nowhere in the year 500 they were copies
of manuscripts made earlier and those manuscripts were made from copies of copies made earlier
made earlier and earlier until you get back to the originals if you get to the year 500 and say
you've got uh you know say you got 200 I don't know what you got you don't have to imagine but
suppose you did have to enter manuscripts those manuscripts are not all copied from the same copy
they're copied from different copies which are copied from different copies which are copied
from different copies so the chances that a change was made in say the year 150 before you have
manuscripts that affected every surviving copy would be really it'd be kind of strange it could
have happened um but you see what I mean because like in the year 150 you'd have a number of copies
you might have like a thousand copies out there or something and those copies we don't have but we
have the copies of the copies that happen to go back to those copies and they're all independent
lines of transmission am I talking sensible English here no you are the the difficulty
is how complex this is for the layman and I'm trying to talk it in a way right that's where
Lakeerson because if you get you know so if somebody when Paul wrote his letter to the Romans
right suppose like um suppose the guy the first person to make a copy of that made a huge change
like added five verses okay and that the original got lost but that copy that added five verses
was the one that everybody then copied so if that happened then we'd have no way of knowing
whether those five verses came back to Paul or the guy who copied it right but the chances of that
happening become more and more remote as time passes on because these manuscripts are all being
traced through different genealogical lines and so really the reality is I'm a scholar study this
I mean this is you know there I did about 20 years trying to work through all these issues
hard stuff and you've got to know the ancient languages and all that but the chances are pretty
good that when you're reading Mark you're basically reading what Mark said uh with you know but you
can't be sure the reason it matters you can't be sure is because fundamentalists want to insist
they have the very words from God they're like well if you want to insist that you're kind of in
trouble here because there's no way you can know that so let me ask you this to get down into a
little more of a detail here in particular um we start seeing this do the church fathers play a
significant role in how we evaluate the textual tradition because for example and I'm talking
about from critical scholars not from like the tradition of church because let's say I said
okay how do we know that they didn't invent most of this writing and the theology that we're looking
at isn't maybe early second century and because there's such friction between certain Christian
groups like what we see with Marcy and coming up with the Valentinians or whoever it might be
there's all this wow wow west happening in the second century how do we know that these manuscripts
aren't actually being developed then and that's when these narratives are playing their role I mean
are you using internal evidence within the text themselves to say these are placed in the 40s 50s
for example with Paul letters or are we also combining church fathers and the the text themselves
internally to try and date them so it's a related it's a related question and but it's a there are
two two big issues going on one is how far back can we trace what the authors wrote uh you know
how can we get back to what they they said uh are we copying something they said or something that
some second century scribe said they said there's that there's also the question when did they actually
write this thing right how do you know that that say that Paul was writing in the 50s if you don't
have manuscripts until later those are act they're related but they're very they're different
methodologies that one uses to establish those two things and and they're very firmly established
methodologies that are a little bit hard to explain to somebody who's not an abnormal scholar doing
this but but the um the church fathers are important for this my my my phd research my dissertation
was actually dealing with this problem of church fathers quoting the new testament and the the issue
is that you um you can you have church fathers living in different parts of the world say in
the second century so you've got a church father living in Rome and somebody living in gull frats
and somebody living in say Palestine and somebody living in Egypt and they're all quoting the text
say they're quoting the gospel john if these different church fathers in different places
are quoting john and they're quoting it the same way that shows that john was circulating and basically
the same form throughout the world which means it was not invented in any one of those places in
the second century because it had already been spread and so what you do one of the things you
have to do is you have to study what the church how the church fathers quote the new testament
because in theory if you can establish with confidence what the church fathers quoted
then you know what their manuscripts looked like and so my my phd dissertation was on uh the writings
of the fourth century church father named didymus the blind uh who's uh from alexandria egypt and
i analyzed all of his quotations of the gospels in detail i mean i extracted all of them in greek
and i compared them to a couple of dozen greek and latin manuscripts we have from the ages to see
which manuscripts he was most closely aligned with to establish what the manuscripts looked like
in fourth century alexandria the ones he had access to and what you do is you do that for
church father after church father after church father and you um and that helps you then know
more about how things are being uh quoted and circulated in periods when we don't have a lot
of manuscripts and so there there's stuff like that that scholars do that most people have never
heard of but we are on this problem let me tell you this is like this is what we do and so um so
based on all of that it's really you know when you're reading the gospel of mark today you can't
know that the verse was originally worded just like this but you can be pretty confident it was
pretty close to that uh with with some things that got changed and some some places where you don't
know what it said you know you just scholars disagreed i mean say this or did say that they
did but we know those places and so it will be really amazing if you know in a hundred years
we have like a different understanding of any of this it would be it's possible but i mean it's yeah
it would be pretty amazing unless we came up with like found a cache with like yeah all sorts of
manuscripts that really were yeah no but but you know every time you we find something it doesn't
give us much new evidence and new manuscripts are discovered all the time and sometimes they're
early manuscripts and they they almost never give us something new and so um if you did if they did
find a copy of something that was um that was really different from the gospel of mark for example
then um probably it wasn't the gospel mark it was some of the gospel break and so uh yeah
so i i don't stay awake at night wondering where i got the mark i i think you know actually
we're as close as we're ever gonna get probably i mean you know it might change you got to be open
to changing but you know it's kind of hard to figure out what would change it so yeah and just to wrap
that one up with a little bow and and icing on the cake is the internal evidence within the text
themselves the difficulty we read the gospels they they act like they're being written in the 30s
or at least they're trying to place the narrative in the 30s it seems um but in reality um most
Christians even that are extremely conservative would still say decades later a couple decades
later 50s 60s whereas we're going to go past the war because there seems to be some x event
to material um going on in the gospel of mark and then of course everything else adds from there
using mark probably um the question is like how do we
pin that down if they're used if they're writing decades and decades and decades later let's say
pretending to be in a certain certain time as if this is when this is really happening
how do we deal with that in light of everything we just discussed okay so so now we have three
questions and the problem is most people don't keep these questions straight my students have a
really difficult time keeping these questions straight so question number one you have all these
manuscripts do they give us what mark originally wrote we're pretty close to it okay uh so uh okay
so you date the manuscript then second question when was mark writing a separate question and how do
you establish a different date and so as you're saying most scholars date him around 70 for reasons
not related to the manuscripts the dating of the manuscripts but then mark's writing 70 and he's
reporting events from 40 years earlier how do we know that he's actually reporting the event from
from those times earlier so those are three different questions and they they um they have to
be decided in three different grounds so the accuracy of what marks mark said is different
from the accuracy of what the manuscript said mark said you see what I mean and yeah it's a
completely different question so the question the accuracy of the gospels is a whole another thing and
there are a different set of scholars who typically I deal with I deal with all of that but most
scholars pick like pick something and so you know are you do how do you know what the historical
Jesus really said and did how do you know how mark is representing changes of those stories based on
his oral traditions and his own editorial interests and how do you know how the manuscripts
change what mark said and so yeah uh so if you have a question you might
undo it's really happy to answer no absolutely it's a very complex issue I just I wanted to I guess
we did show how complex this is even in the conversation it's a deep dive so moving on to
the next one what are the chester baby papyri and when are they dated is it true they include the
earliest copies copies of portions of the Pauline corpus uh yeah so um the the chester baby papyri
were were published in the about 100 years ago uh or so uh they um the the background the background
of this again it's complicated people you know a lot of people know the king james version of
course the king james version is an english translation of of greek of the greek text of
the new testament the greek text of the new testament that the king james translators
in 1611 were using was an edition that had been originally produced early soon soon after the
invention of printing had been uh produced by uh a a scholar a european scholar named
erasmus in the 16th century and he had a few manuscripts available to him late not very ancient
manuscripts a few manuscripts available to him he decided what does a printer going to print you
know a printer wants to print the new testament right uh so well what do you print i mean you
know you don't have any printed editions yet and so like you got to print a greek you want to print
a greek text so people will have it in printing instead of having manuscripts so well somebody has
to decide because you got all these manuscripts and they differ from each other so erasmus came
up with this thing he said okay we're gonna print this they printed that and the king james translators
then translated that uh so in 1611 so about 200 years later or so no i'm sorry about yeah about 200
years later in the 19th century scholars started thinking you know that greek edition that they
were translating there we have all these new manuscripts that they they didn't know about
and they're different from that and so they started working on how to know what the original text said
given all these differences manuscripts at the end of the 19th century um there were two
british scholars named westcott and hort who who decided that the greek version that the king
james is based on was flawed seriously flawed it had the woman taken in an adultery which you
mentioned earlier it had the last twelve verses of mark it had lots of differences they came up with
a new edition of the greek new testament that was based on what they considered to be the oldest
and best manuscripts okay so that's in the 1880s about 40 years later they started discovering
even older manuscripts and the chester beady poetry were papyri were were the most significant
early find uh they include large portions of a number of the books of the new testament
they are fragmentary but they have there are early copies of uh some of the gospels and of
paul's letters that date to around the year 200 westcott and hort were basing their their
decisions on manuscripts dating from the fourth century from around 370 uh some of your listeners
will know about codex sinaiticus or codex valicanus these were the two big ones for westcott and
hort so the issue is when the chester beady papyri were discovered now you've got manuscripts that
are over our century earlier from what our text is based on and since then they've discovered
hundreds of um not hundreds over a hundred of these ain't older pipe older manuscripts
and the reality is that despite these discoveries westcott and hort's edition is still basically
what we use today because because the the evidence is supporting what they found what they and what
they conjectured these are two really smart guys especially hort was really into this
and and they they conjectured what future discoveries would be and they were right
and so these papyri they don't completely like coincide with what westcott and hort came up with
but when you look at the totality of these discoveries started with the chester beady papyri
you can uh you you can see that in fact they were they're right and so that's our editions
haven't changed much since then thank you so much for that all right what is the berlin codex and
when is it dated what importance does it have for new testament scholars uh okay so um for new
testament scholars per se uh it is not uh the the berlin papyrus is not that important because
it's it doesn't contain any new testament texts so the the berlin papyrus was discovered in uh
the the berlin codex was discovered in 1896 is discovered by a a german scholar he didn't
discover it actually he bought it he was in uh chiro and he he uh he bought it and it's um uh
from somebody who had it and who said it was found and it dates from the fifth century
it's a fifth century manuscript and it but it's really important for people not not for like
people interested in the gospel you know john or something so much but um but for early christian
scholars because it has four four texts in it including one of the most important gnostic texts
that we know of the apocryphon of john which was a which is a gnostic text that is fundamental for
understanding gnosticism and that was discovered in other other manuscripts later in the 1940s
but the the the one that's really cool that was really important is the gospel of mary
this this berlin codex contained four four is a small anthology of four texts but one of them
was a gospel of mary which is the gospel of mary magdalene and it's not that she wrote this gospel
but it's a gospel it's another gnostic gospel these are gnostic texts uh in them and in the gospel
of mary uh we have an account of jesus giving a a secret revelation to mary that can unpack the
truths of the universe and um and uh the problem is she uh she's talking to the disciples and she
starts describing this vision that jesus gave to her and at that point we're missing pages of the
manuscript why would she start saying what their revelation is that he gave her oh my god and these
are the mysteries but then it picks up again and uh and she's still talking about this revelation
and and so we can unpack a good bit of it and um the uh the the disciples the men decide one of
the things that's made this really interesting the men disciples uh peter and levi and these other
alpheas they they get a little ticked off uh andrew because they're saying why did jesus reveal it to
her she's a woman why didn't you reveal it to us and they have this big argument among themselves
and uh mary calms them down and they and so it really has been a very it's been an important
gospel for uh in the last 20 or 30 years for people recognizing the importance of women
in early christianity and uh the significance of mary magdalene and early christianity and it's
this this kind of really interesting bizarre uh bizarre gospel if i may just not to spend much
time but yes or no might even suffice did mary play a much bigger role you think in early christianity
and was suppressed no i don't think so i mean i think so you know mary magdalene of course you
know today everybody wants to talk to about like she was the most important disciple and
she was really close to jesus oh boy were they closed in fact they had babies you know you get
to get the da Vinci code yeah that's that's all right but you know it's weird people don't realize
this that in the gospels of the new testament during jesus entire public ministry in all four
gospels she's mentioned once it's in luke chapter eight she and two other women joanna and susanna
help support jesus and the apostles by providing them with their financial means so that they
don't have to work and that that's all it says about her but she's significant because she's
in the gospel she is the first to discover that the tomb is empty jesus tomb is empty and so
historically you know if if that were right that mary magdalene was the first to say that jesus
was raised from the dead she'd be pretty important right it would mean she founded christianity
uh that's pretty important right uh and so uh she was important i don't i don't think
her importance was particularly uh suppressed in early christianity thank you so much uh
might butcher the term here but what is the akmim codex and when is it dated what importance
does it have for new testament scholars yeah akmim the akmim codex is another codex that
comes from uh that comes from egypt this is a this this is one i've spent a lot of time working on
the last few years actually it's um it discovered in um 1886 or 1887 by a group of french archaeologists
who were digging in an area uh in uh in um southern so what they call upper egypt in a place called
akmim um uh and it um so uh there's some cemeteries in akmim and these french archaeologists
who are digging these in a cemetery and they uncovered a tomb and in the tomb they found a
66 page book uh and uh they thought that the person who had been buried with with the book
must have been a monk because who else would be buried a book they reasoned and not everybody buys
that the the manuscript itself probably dates to the sixth century it is also a small anthology of
texts 66 pages written in greek um the first text is the gospel of peter um which is now uh one of the
more better known gospels from outside the new testament among lay readers a very important
gospel we only have a fragment of it this the manuscript itself is a complete manuscript
no it is a complete book like it has the book as a whole book but the scribe who was copying this
thing probably in the sixth century only had a portion of the gospel peter to copy and so he
you know it begins with the blank page he's got a page with the decoration then the text begins
so it's clear it's it's not fragmentary but it begins in the middle of an episode and it begins
by saying uh since none of the jews would wash their hands pilot stood up and from there you get
the rest of the account of jesus trial so apparently right before this pilot has washed
his hands of jesus blood which is an incident you find in the gospel of matthew only in matthew
in the new testament and then it continues and it gives an alternative account of jesus trial
and his death and his resurrection and it's very very and it ends by the way it ends in the middle
of the sentence it's like right in the middle so but the the resurrection account's really
interesting it's an important text because it people don't realize this the new testament
does not narrate the resurrection of jesus there's no story of jesus resurrection in the new
testament what happens in the new testament is jesus dies and he's buried and on the third day the
women find that the tomb is empty yeah there's no like watch what happened yeah this is no count
there's no account of the resurrection itself the gospel peter gives an account of the resurrection
um and in this it's a fantastic account the uh the romans are afraid somebody's going to steal
the body and so they post this guard around the tomb again like in in the gospel of matthew
although it's worded very differently and as the guard is standing there watching on the on the third
day two beings descend from heaven and as these angelic beings descend the stone rolls away from
the tomb they go into the tomb and then when they come out there are three of them and the two of them
are as tall so tall their head reaches up to the sky and the third is so tall his head reaches up
above the sky they're supporting him and they walk out of the tomb and then behind them they're
they're comes out i don't know if it's levitating or what but the it comes the cross comes out
comes out behind them and then a voice comes from heaven and says have you preached to those
who are asleep and the cross says yes it's great and so you get this giant jesus and the walking
talking cross and it's this like the and uh uh yeah so preach to those who are asleep means um
you know there's the message gone to those who have died who had died before and the idea here
is that the message of the cross uh salvation doesn't come just to those who happen to live
after jesus you know the lucky us he died for our sins and you know what about the people before him
well doesn't he go to haiti's or something yeah the the the message went down to do the underworld
and so the so people had a chance to repent down there just as they do up there so yeah so there's
that there's that that's one of the four texts the other one that's really interesting that i spent
most of my time working on the last couple years is the apocalypse of peter which i don't need to
say more about unless you want to hear but it's it's it's the first surviving account a christian
account of a guided tour of heaven and hell where peter is shown by jesus the realms of the blessed
and the tortures of the damned and the torture of the damned goes into great detail it's really
interesting something about that they love um yeah thank you so much for that let's go to the next
one what is the edgerton gospel and when is it dated what importance does it have for new
testament scholars so the edgerton it's uh the edgerton gospel or the edgerton papyrus is one
of these uh gospels that didn't uh obviously it didn't make it into the new testament it's sometimes
called papyrus edgerton two because there are other other edgerton papyri it's a it's a small
fragmentary text um that has these four uh it has these it has four episodes in it but it's an
account of jesus it's a gospel uh it comes from a gospel but you don't have a complete story you
got these four little stories uh and one of them uh jesus is confronting his um his adversaries
apparently jewish adversaries in a passage that's similar to the gospel of john where it tells them
that they should read the scriptures because he's revealed in the scriptures and then you've
got another one where he heals a leper and you've got so the last one is um is the last episode is
interesting because it's really fragmentary and it looks like what happens is jesus takes some
seed and he sews it on water and it grows and it's this miracle and so the the four passages
are all similar to things in the new testament but their date but they're um uh but the word is
very very differently in some ways and it was interesting when this thing was discovered in
the early uh when it when it came to be known in the early 20th century so about a hundred years ago
because the scholars who discovered it dated it dated this fragment they had to the year 150
which was earlier than any biblical manuscript at the time you know and so they started saying
look they called it the unknown gospel but they were saying you know this is the manuscript we have
is earlier than any biblical man is it possible that this gospel is earlier that it was written
earlier than matthew mark luke and john at least it raises the possibility and it still is a possibility
although most scholars today point out that these different stories have combinations of stories from
the gospels of the new testament so it's more likely that it's a compilation of stories that
it's heard from earlier sources and so it doesn't necessarily mean dates earlier and the more
more recent investigations have dated it a little bit later more to around the year 200
and now we do have biblical manuscripts earlier than that so anyway so that's that's a papyrus
interesting that's interesting history there um in an earlier interview you briefly talked about
the secret gospel of mark and whether it could be a modern forgery what are your thoughts about the
so-called gospel of jesus wife that has created such a controversy over the past decade unlike mark
the actual document is available and can be directly examined and evaluated by specialist
yeah uh right we don't have the secret gospel of mark so we can't evaluate that and the secret
gospel mark is really not an entire gospel it's a it's an episode not found in mark that
allegedly was originally in mark and so so we don't have it to examine it we don't know where it is
or if it exists anymore um but yeah the the gospel of jesus wife is a different thing uh this is a
small uh piece of papyrus that um was announced uh to the world by uh karen king a professor of
a very fine professor of gnosticism and early christianity who's now retired from harvard
and uh she had bought it she hadn't bought it but but the person who owned it had uh showed it to her
and um it's a it's a just a little fragment that is um that has a few lines of jesus talking
and and an area and at one point it says his wife and we're referring to jesus
whoa uh and so this fellow was trying to sell it sell this papyrus and uh karen king presented it at
a international conference of experts on ancient koptic and um i have a colleague who's there i
i have several people i know people who were there who immediately said this is not genuine it's a
forgery um and uh karen king thought it probably was authentic and she she tried to document and
she and she got people on her on her side some of the greatest uh scholars of ancient papyrus in
the world looked at it and authenticated it eventually it came to be discredited and was
shown actually to be a modern forgery it appears to be an ancient uh piece of papyrus that somebody
wrote on it like they got ancient ink or whatever they wrote on it and they made it up uh and so it
has been completely discredited now as and so nobody even karen king nobody thinks that it's
authentic there's a book um oh god i'm gonna forget this person's name he's famous he's a
journalist the book is called veritas it's the this entire book is about the discovery
and the uh the unfolding of this whole papyrus and what happened and how and he established
um aerial what's his name so um uh how he uh sabar aerial sabar um and so people are interested
in that get the book veritas they can read all about it yeah there's so much uh fun interesting
stuff i wonder if there's a book specifically written to actually talk about everything that
has come out to be a forgery i wonder if anything slips through the cracks that we haven't uh yeah
well people look into it all the time because there are lots of things and there are there are
lots of books about modern forgeries there's some really interesting books you readers would be
interested in on forgeries of gospels that were that are still influential in the 19th century
there's a spate of books so when people talk about like jesus is a young man going to india
and learning from the brahmans or you know like you get all these stories uh these apocryphal
stories about jesus most of them come from 19th century gospels and they've all been discredited
i have a chapter on that in my book called forged about the 19th century gospels so yeah thank you
so much for that bar um by the latter second century it is estimated the number of christians
in the roman empire had surpassed a hundred thousand still a small percentage of the overall
population and were concentrated in urban areas was celsus the first pagan scholar uh scholars
know to compose a or known to compose a major attack against the movement and that much of
the work is preserved in origins reply contra celsus can scholars determine how it compared
to a similar book written a century later by the pagan philosopher uh porphyry
wow okay phd exam time all right bring it on yeah so uh i would say probably a hundred thousand
around the second around year 200 probably it's you know it's not wildly off but it's uh you
know to guess um celsus was a uh was a um a pagan who attacked christianity in writing he um um
he he wrote a book called the true word where he tries to show that christianity is completely
bogus and he is to our knowledge the first to produce a literary text arguing this we don't have
his uh his book anymore uh 50 year he wrote it in the 170s about 50 years later a very fine christian
scholar origin the the the greatest intellectual christianity of the first three centuries was
this man named origin from alexandra egypt and he wrote a he wrote the book that you referred to
the contra celsus uh or against celsus um where uh he quotes celsus word for word all through this
entire book it's a big book that he wrote and he quotes celsus and then refutes celsus and so you
have a pretty good idea of a lot of what celsus actually said because origin just quotes him i
mean just literal and it doesn't look like he's manufacturing the quotes or that he's dockering
them he looks like he's just quoting what he's got and you know scholars have looked into that of
course to see but but um so and then he replies to it uh and so celsus was a very bright guy
philosopher and he thought that christians were not very bright and uh and uh so and uh so and so
and so he he attacks the books of the new testament uh and so forth um about um yeah so in the next
century we get an even more sophisticated attack by an even better philosopher porphyry
who was uh a uh a neoplatonist um philosopher who was uh very very bright we don't have his book
and we don't have extensive um quotations of his book uh but we do have some christian sources
that appear to be replying to it and so it's possible to reconstruct at least some of his
arguments but he was a very um uh he he was a high level intellectual um and it may be that his
attacks on christianity were influential at the higher reaches of the roman empire
leading to some of the persecutions especially the great persecution under diacletian
diacletian may have been influenced by uh by this attack on christian by porphyry
wow do you think uh there's in just a personal question briefly is do you think the criticisms
by celsus are pretty valid in terms of what he what he's saying if you were diving into
we'd have to kind of put on the mind of both celsus and christianity but do you think he
had some really valid criticisms that people should go and read oh i think they should definitely
read it because he says uh he says uh i mean from a from a pagan point of view he makes he
makes a really good argument and origin um origin's reply makes sense um makes a lot of sense to
people who are um who are christians because he has kind of a christian assumption of things
but origin was probably was as equal intellectually at least and um but they they're coming out from
very different points of view very different perceptions and so whether you find him convincing
or not will depend to a great degree on how uh on what what side you personally are on
but he does you know he he goes after jesus and he you know and he says that he's this lower class
guy and that he's he's not well educated and that he there's a bunch of myths about him and
the the gospels tell things it could not have happened and and um so you know he he he attacked
christianity the way the modern modern attackers of christianity would probably do it uh and
origin replies the way modern apologists would reply so he's a pagan uh origin's a christian
and i'm not either i'm i'm neither side i guess so my question would be like if i'm approaching this uh
in looking for valid criticisms and then reading origin you know how they have that
wise proverb that says a man gives his argument and he seems right until the other guy gives his
argument then you're like crap who's right because both sides are making great cases um someone who's
sitting outside of that as an atheist or agnostic depending on how you want to approach this um
reading it would you say there's valid points on both sides and in what they're trying to argue
well i think logically but i would say anybody who's interested in the defense of christianity
would benefit from reading the uh against celsus because celsus makes some very interesting
points i mean and and origin has interesting ways of responding to them what my my sometimes i found
that when somebody makes a controversial position like they they develop a controversial position
on a i'll say on christianity and then somebody takes the other position sometimes when the person
takes the other position you actually think because you know you think well that's the best
thing to be done huh i actually agree the first guy now right you know so that happens sometimes too
and i think what you do is you just approach it with an open mind and try to figure out who
makes the best argument origin won the argument in the sense that origin you know christianity took
over right but um it doesn't necessarily doesn't necessarily mean that he has the better argument
well put well put thank you so much who were the mandians and do some scholars believe they
have originated from followers of john the baptist in the jordan valley that they consider john to be
the messiah while jesus and paul were the heretics that they helped originate gnosticism aren't there
still communities of them today uh yeah so the mandians uh man mandianism is a religion that was
it's hard to know when it began because they the mandians have always claimed they started at the
beginning and so it's like um and so it's it's it's hard it's hard to know they are a they're
they're a dual so they do exist still today as a small group um they may have been in competition
with christianity uh at one point in the early centuries um they are a religion that is dualistic
in nature that that stresses very much the opposition of the forces of good and evil
which are portrayed as the forces of light and darkness uh and they're at constant battle with
with each other they they have sacred scriptures uh they uh they're not christian uh they are more
like gnostics in their dualism uh and their their relationships between mandians and gnostics we have
some of the mandian texts one of their texts is called the book of john and that's not uh that's
not the gospel of john it's it's a different john and john the baptist it's uh but the the three main
books they have are all filled mainly filled with their teachings uh about these oppositions of
light and darkness and how it gets worked out in various mythological ways but the uh this book of
john does have a chapter about the life of john the baptist and it's quite clear that john the
baptist was an important figure in the movement and uh and mandians do claim him as one of their own
uh uh and so um yeah so uh it's not it's not one of these areas that is extensively studied
by scholars of christianity probably should be there are books written about and there are people
who are experts on it but it's not like a major field the way say gnosticism is uh in in christian
studies but there do continue to be the the the story that they tell themselves is that
they uh emigrated from palestine that they came out of palestine and then settled in up north of
the persian gulf and that's where the historically the communities have been up north of the persian
gulf thank you so much for that really appreciate it who uh was tation and what was the diateseron
what importance do scholars attach to his role in early christianity okay uh tation was uh a
tation was a christian teacher who came from syria who uh emigrated to roam and in the middle
of the second century was a student of justin martyr um justin martyr was one of the first
intellectuals of christianity in roam he was he's our first apologist who works survive at length
a defender of the christian faith um and so he was this he was his philosopher christian
philosopher in roam and tation came to study with him tation we don't know a lot about tation's life
he eventually left roam and went back to syria he he's famous for two things one is that he had a
very strict kind of morality and he's sometimes called an encritite uh encritism is a kind of
like ascetic lifestyle where you you deny yourself the pleasures of the flesh uh and so he's thought
of as an encritite but the more famous thing about tation is that he produced an edition of the
gospels the edition of the gospels is called the diateseron um diateseron uh if you spell it out
dia means through in greek like going through something and tesseron is four so through the four
this is a gospel harmony what he did is he took what is what we think of as the four gospels
and he combined them into one large narrative uh and so that um you know you'll have part of
matthew part of mark and kind of all interwoven so that when you get a story that you get in
different versions of matthew mark and luke say you know it gets presented as one story in the diateseron
so it was a very large is a very large book and it became the official it was the gospel used in
syriac speaking christianity for centuries they did not use what they what we what they called the
separate gospels the separate gospel being matthew mark luke and john they used the diateseron
unfortunately we don't have it and one of the thorniest oh my god one of the hardest areas of
new testament studies i mean where angels feared to tread is trying to figure out what the original
diateseron said um and there been there been major developments in that over the last 20 years
but it is a mind-boggling exercise to try and figure out what what was originally in the diateseron
in part because we have have other gospel harmonies that are probably unrelated to the diateseron
and so when you come with a when you find like a church father quoting a harmonious text it's hard
to know what he's quoting and so but there are scholars who spend i know i know i have friend
i know people who spent their lives trying to figure out the diateseron yeah one of the things
about it that really makes me personally wonder what the motivating factor for creating the diateseron
was for is is they saw problems so so maybe they saw multiple narratives and they wanted to unify
what the narrative probably was i guess was this an apologetic you think to it's a good question
and i think it's hard to know if that was the motivation it's plausible it's certainly plausible
as a motivation uh that you've got these contradictions and you you smooth them out by putting them
together another another plausible motive is that you've got these four accounts wouldn't
it be convenient just to have them all in one place and you know if you have different gospel
writers writing different different versions it'd be nice to have the full version yeah because
if i may ask just to probe you on this even further do you personally think and this is
speculation but do you personally think whoever wrote mark would have like would be rolling over
in their grave to know that his document is sitting right next to this document by a person they call
matthew and matthew sitting next to a document by a person named luke when they are purposely
writing contrary material like that it seems like they're competing it appears can you know if you
um you know if you put uh if you take a uh an article that i wrote and you put it in a collection
with an article that richard carrier wrote uh and then you interpreted my article in light
of his article like permanent you know carriers i probably would think you know that's really
not how i want you to interpret my article and probably mark you know mark would have been the
first he probably had no idea others were going to do it but he he certainly did not expect
somebody like matthew to come along and change what he said for his gospel and think well mat
and and luke especially i think luke would especially roll over in his grave because luke
begins his gospel by saying that many others have tried to make it you know tried to explain
what happened in the life of jesus now i'm going to give you the accurate account you put his gospel
next to these two of them that he might have one of them that he used that he changed you know
no i've got the accurate account right this is a later move and it's it's the hardest thing for
me to get my students to understand that mark is not matthew and what john says is not lucas saying
and these are different authors because you buy them it's in one book and so naturally you just
think it's one author no it's not one author might i ask why you think that is do you do you
think it's because of our upbringings in evangelicalism or in a particular religious
backgrounds that make us make us difficult for us to come to our mineralize or i don't think it's
about evangelicalism i think it's about the canonization of the bible we we went when the
church fathers decided to make a canon a you know a collection of books that would be the
authoritative books they're all authoritative on the same level and since they're all authoritative
on the same level you can put them in between bound covers and they're all saying the same thing
and this was a decision that was both to um is to control various heretical
understandings because certain books were left out they're like that's not authoritative only
these are authority so it leaves things out but it also um smooths over the differences uh and so
it's in order to provide a unified vision but the unified vision comes only by putting all
these things together rather than letting them circulate separately i have to tell everybody
right now if you haven't watched his genesis lectures must go because you talk about the greatest
discovery and i thought this was a profound statement by you the greatest discovery is not
the dead sea scrolls the greatest discovery is not the nakamadi the greatest discovery is not
this text that text it's finding out that the the books are not written by the same people and
they're written in different places with different agendas contradictory motives whatever it might be
like i'm the point is compartmentalizing text and sometimes the texts themselves are written by
multiple authors and different sections in that book may not even be by the same person
that was the greatest discovery and i think that if we apply that same logic to the new testament
we can also say that's the greatest discovery so thank you so much for that dr anon yeah yeah
okay so who were the nastorians and is it true they were largely responsible for the spread
of christianity in central and east asia prior to the rise of islam in the seventh century
the nastorians are a uh
they're they're named that after nastorius who had uh christological views that were
different from the orthodox views they they were important for the spread of christianity
they're after my period i know i'm very little about them yeah yeah you would probably refer
us to shoemaker or someone in the going to anybody who's doing late antiquity the
the christological controversies i don't think people realize this the christological controversies
after the council nicaea get really really complicated um they have to do with you know
because you people think that everything got decided that the council nicaea okay he's fully
god he's fully man completely equal to god fine let's move on yeah the movie gone thing it gets
really really uh complicated because people have to resolve whether christ so if christ is both god
and man he's both human and divine is he like 100 of each uh is he 50 of each does he have
two spirits is he like both does he have a divine thing and a human thing competing in
each other or is it just one or is he just the other and so the debates get actually more intense
after the council nicaea and the logic gets more and more refined um to a point that it's
kind of hard to explain simply what these various debates are to uh to normal human beings so like
who died on the cross is this such a difficult thing is it just man or that goes way back of
course because the nostics insisted that the man died but the christ survived but then if christ
if christ doesn't have a human body soul and spirit suppose suppose his spirit is divine
but the body and soul are human so you know once you get into these kinds of controversies it gets
very complicated exactly thank you so much for that dr amin didn't some early christian churches
who were located outside the roman empire developed different canons for their bibles
than the 66 eventually agreed upon by the proto orthobox church for example doesn't the ethiopian
church accept 81 books as sacred up to this day it appears the standard canon remains fluid even
now since Protestant and catholic bibles differ while luther debated whether to include james
and revelation in this german translation even today with the 1940s recovery of the gospel of
tom as some scholars wonder whether it should be added to the canon well it's a complicated question
um and there are churches with different different canons that's true um but it's a question what it
means when you say when one says that it's fluid because in none of these communities is a fluid
in other words uh in the in the Protestant tradition when you have 27 books in the new
testament it's true that other traditions might have no other books but the Protestant tradition
not fluid you're not going to start finding bookstores selling bibles with i mean there's not and
and so um so the the reality is the canon was never fixed people have this idea that um you know
there was a vote at the council nicaea or something or that they ever constantly decided when the
canon was going to be and that's not none of that's true there never was a vote the first vote
ever taken on the canon by a worldwide church council i'm talking about a worldwide church
council was the council of Trent in the 16th century it's the first time any major council
took a vote on the canon and they were voting because they wanted to include the apocrypha
because the Protestants were rejecting it um and so i wouldn't say that the canon is fluid i say
there are different canons in different christian communities um and that that is absolutely true
and i'll say by the way i've decided uh now i've finished writing whatever book i was writing
i my next my my next major book i'm thinking about doing a book on the canon um because it's uh
and probably a popular book on the canon as well to explain to people how all this happened
because it's the question i get almost more than any other how do we get this and i think
there's not really a book that i can refer people to that i think is really a popular book that i like
so yeah yeah there's a lot of uh conspiracies about this issue and i think it's necessary that
someone sticks with the fact shows what happened you know give us the case but oftentimes in this
field i do hear an apologetic is that well um early church fathers already had a situated
steady canon that they used from justin martyr you know onward um they were all using what we
have as the new testament so they're making it's not true it's not true it's not true it's
false and we're going to show it you're going to show this not much to show all you have to do
i mean like anybody who does any research at all can show that's not true it's not true so my first
i'll tell you my first um my first uh article that i ever published back in you know 1983
senator 40 40 years ago now was dealing with one aspect of this problem uh what what scholars had
long said was and scholars still will say even though it's wrong is that the canon wasn't fixed
at the council nicaea but that the canon was fixed uh by uh bishop Athanasius in alexandria
egypt um in the year um uh 369 he wrote his uh he he wrote his uh 52nd uh festival letter uh the
festival letter went out every year in order to establish uh never mind it's a letter he wrote every
year to his his churches um and in this letter he listed our 27 books of the new testament and he
said these are the books of the the new testament boom boom boom and it's our 27 books and scholars
always have said that's when it's 379 379 um and uh that's when it was fixed and so my first scholar
of the article i mentioned earlier didymus the blind reading through didymus's writings i realized
that he had a larger canon there are books of the new testament he thought were parts of the
new testament that were not in Athanasius's list and he and Athanasius were living at the same time
in the same city and so they and so i showed so this is an article i published in the european journal
and i just showed that uh didymus had a different different understanding and so Athanasius did not
settle the canon in the year 379 and it never was completely settled because these different churches
have different things and these people say that it was established in the second century it's just
completely bogus it's not true you can show it's not because you can see we have lists of which
books are in the canon from after justin that have different books so how can you say it was fixed
wow i really appreciate that our final question and i don't know how much of this you'll be able
to answer you might have to refer to someone else who specializes in it but he probably
knows something does the dna or do dna studies show significant genetic differences between
jews and other peoples living in the near east i don't know i don't either i don't know what that
i'm not even sure what it means i mean like if we were trying to maybe i'm gonna guess here
because you know how they get back to like where does israel come from right and we can say they
were canaanites using internal evidence but some argue there's a genetic reason that they think that
there's a relationship between israelites and canaanites i think i don't know the genetics
oh i see what they're saying i wonder if that's what is being meant here by my saying i think the
answer is no i mean if you if you trace the dna samples to um various people living in the levant
there there's not a genetic difference between israelites and canaanites in in a significant
genetic difference no i thought i thought this question was doing something a little bit more
insidious than that um that um you know in the 19th century the um anthropologists just started
developing race theories about uh about various races and trying to explain why there's such
differences in different locations around the world uh and they developed these idea these
various races of human and and that that led to um you know a semitic race and once you start having
these these races then you know one might be superior to another and so the whole nazi program
was built on the superiority of the arian race for uh because of um because of bloodlines and so
it it turned out being really a very a very dangerous set of propositions and so i thought
they were going that way so uh if they're talking about is there any kind of genetic
difference between the people who emerged as israel and the people who emerged as you know the
philistines or something the answer is probably no i don't think so what if we were digging up
bones let's say or we had some dna to test uh on a first century body between a roman let's say or
a greek and a jew someone who might be a practicing jew is there any way to to know that one is coming
from a semitic culture and they might have genetic similarities that we can use to say hey this seems to
be the family groups of particular people of culture in this region uh are different than what
we find within greek you can trace where the people came from but you can't trace what they
believed right practiced i mean jewish culture was practiced in rome and so jewish culture
was practiced in jr roman culture was practiced in israel and so there's not so there's a difference
between genetic makeup and i mean genetic makeup has to do with your ancestry it doesn't have to
do with your culture or your religion right uh and so um you know i think i think what it can
what dna can show is where people came from and so what i what i would suggest you know if somebody
digs up two people from um you know from the first century and you want to know i what i suggest is
they go to ancestry dot com or uh you know i'm with you i'm with you plug it in and see what you get
you're always a treasure uh to talk with to learn from and um if i could afford to go to
chapel hill i would just to learn and and and take my phd courses i think i'm already ahead
of the game a little so i might do okay uh i know that's the only thing i'd have like
having to learn a language is not simple but um i hope everybody will take the time to go to your
website on your website your blog is attached to this all the courses online i mean you even
have your yell courses on here what else do you have on your uh website well the main thing i'm
doing on my website now is i'm advertising i can you know i give i give public talks and speeches
and i have these courses that people can purchase uh and i do consultations this is the new thing
i've started doing people who are uh who are authors uh you know i've written a lot and i've
dealt a lot with publishers and with editors and so i can give advice about publishing not just in
my field uh that that gets a little pricey because i don't want to do a lot of it but but but uh but
so it's basically consult consulting uh writing and speaking thank you the courses the courses
with something yeah there you go you got the books you got the courses absolutely all the books on
amazon you can go through his website and go to books and find them as well through here i mean
it's such a beautiful website really is and i hope that people will go and educate themselves because
i always enjoy your works you also have a lot of them on audible and then last of all you know like
the apostle paul born in in in a untimely manner if you will we have the patreon helps support us
right um we talked about manicheism in this one i'm doing a lot of work i wrote an article
that was too long uh to to put on your blog i'm hoping to potentially uh publish uh of course
you'll have to to scrutinize but send you uh possible articles and see if you'd be interested
in publishing it on your blog i'm doing uh what i coined a phrase called the minimal doubts argument
and i'm focusing on doubting tradition in the new testament so i'll be sending you that yeah okay so
but i you know i do want your listeners to to remember that i have this blog and i post on it
all the time and i have guest posters sometimes and and it's a way to get this kind of information
regularly and there's a there's a small fee to charge we charge a small fee to join but every
bit of the fee goes to charities so i and right now you're helping ukraine right i mean we've
been raising some significant money for ukraine and so i i hope people just check out the barter
blog thank you for that and thank you for your humanitarian acts and stuff like that
i really look forward to our next discussion when i really scrutinize your phd skills again
and again okay go for it so thank you and never forget go in the description all of the links
are there and we are
