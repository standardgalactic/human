And I'll say up front, the Book of Revelation flops on its face.
It literally does not get fulfilled.
We're gonna do some reading now.
Is everyone who's serious about this prepared to do a little reading with me?
Someone already has jumped on it.
Most people turn it off if it isn't about them.
The Book of Revelation has, you know, four, if you will, apocalyptic figures that come out.
And it's vivid in its imagination.
It has so much symbolism that it is doomed to get interpreted in a million ways.
And the hard part for skeptics like us, who might be viewing this or people who are critical in their approach,
is trying to get it pinned down on the meaning of some of the things described in this highly symbolic book.
And I just got off the phone with John Dominic Crossen, which we're gonna bring up his book.
We're gonna bring up Adela Cullen's book on the combat myth that we find in Revelation.
We're gonna bring up Elaine Pagels, I'll probably just mention in passing.
I'll reference the book on Amazon, but I'm not going into this.
I want to start out with saying something that I think is important since my journey here on myth vision.
And that is that when you're investigating topics of biblical studies, always go to experts first.
Whoa, dude, that you're committing some fallacy here of like going to the scholars.
No, I'm not.
Go to the experts, study what all scholars have to say, because the likeliness,
as my friend Stephen just said on Facebook, we've been having a discussion on the Facebook group.
Maybe it's worthy of sharing my screen so everybody understands what we have going on.
There is a Facebook group.
In fact, let me bring it up here.
So that anybody who's on Facebook who likes dialogue, we do have a myth vision Facebook group.
And it's a private group.
So if you don't want family, friends, et cetera, seeing the kind of heretic you are or the stuff you're looking into,
you can join the Facebook group.
And there's a lot of debate that goes on in there.
One of the topics is revelation lately.
But I also have a page that you can check out myth vision page.
I'm going to close that out because Facebook makes all sorts of noise when people are notifying and there's always a message.
Join the Patreon.
I've got some good stuff there.
A lot of stuff with John.
I'm going to cross in this one right here with Ross K. Nichols.
We were in an old Israelite or Judean fortress.
When we recorded this one.
Also, I've got tons of Paul Frederickson videos and the list goes on and on and on.
The deeper you go in here, you're going to find stuff that you just don't find anywhere else.
Let's come back to my ugly mug.
Now that we're back here.
I always recommend reading scholars who have a grasp of the source material who know the language that we're engaging in.
And then from there, draw conclusions.
The likeliness that a Facebook or a YouTube person such as myself, who's read a lot about the Bible,
who's dove into this stuff for quite some time, turning over the tables of academia is really unlikely.
Is it possible?
It's possible.
But you really, really need to wrap your head around the material first in order to do so.
Even with people, for example, like Russell Gamirkin, who has a very late view on the canon of the Hebrew Bible.
He believes that the translation of the Hebrew into Greek that's taken place, the Hebrew wasn't far behind the Septuagint translation.
So, you know, he had to have read Peter von Severs and read Ronald Hendel and read all of the academics in the field.
Before he drew his conclusions that he thought there was more Hellenistic or Greek ideas in the Bible.
And to explain that material, he needed to know that and he wrote his books.
This is very important.
As we venture into something extremely symbolic that literally anything can mean anything.
So, we're dealing with the book of Revelation.
You saw the thumbnail.
You know who that picture is.
It's Nero.
Nero Caesar, who was the fifth Caesar of the Caesars in line from Augustus.
Augustus being the first Caesar of Rome.
Five have fallen.
One is or something to this effect where the wound, right, that would there was this return idea of some figure that was supposed to happen in the book of Revelation.
And when you look into it, you find that there is a resurrection or reborn narrative, Nero Redivivus that was going on really passionately in the first second century.
But for five or six centuries, Eusebius talks about how this is still something that might happen in his day.
This is fourth century, right?
So, you're you're you're dealing with this idea that Nero would come back.
And we're going to get into that material here in a minute and talk about what is going on in the book of Revelation.
I'll say one thing about scholarship.
As I've dove into this and you know, I've got for those who are interested at GK Bill has a commentary.
I had this back when I was reformed a Calvinist and I was reading this a long time ago just to reference it and learn about what was going on in the book of Revelation.
He's a, you know, well-learned scholar and he points out seven hills or seven mountains.
We find in Revelation 17 is a common phrase in reference for Rome.
Now, unless you find other phrases for other places and that is a common thing that would have been known in the late first century.
Why do we date this to the late first century?
I'll leave that up to academics as you guys can investigate research.
But this seems like Rome.
But there's some scholars like Margaret Barker who would suggest that it's actually Jerusalem.
They're trying to argue for Jerusalem.
So any other positions out there just haven't made segue to be important enough to be the issue being discussed in the book of Revelation.
Also emphasize that singularity there that it's, it's a singular, it's revelation.
Often people say revelations about the book and it's not, you know, it's, it's a book, a single book.
Just correcting that because I used to do that for a while.
And I'll say up front, the book of Revelation flops on its face.
It literally does not get fulfilled.
That doesn't mean there aren't things that I would like to say that are written exit event to signify and possibly,
oh, that happened and may have sounded like it may happen at some point funds in the Gospels with the destruction of Jerusalem,
where Jesus seems to be predicting down to a T about the destruction of the Jerusalem temple.
Paula Frederickson said, I just don't buy it.
I don't buy it.
Though there could have been a Jew like Jesus been in a nice that was found in Josephus.
Whoa, do you scribes and look at the temple?
It's going to be destroyed.
It's not ridiculous to think Jews thought Romans would destroy the temple possibly.
But I like her thinking on this.
Anywho, let me get this was a super sticker here.
It's red and that means it's blood.
Damon, you're already prophesying where this is headed.
Seriously, thank you so much for the super sticker.
Appreciate that.
Feel free to super chat.
If you want your name in the Lambert's book of life, I won't blot you out.
OK, I promise.
Let me share this screen here.
Let's get into some stuff.
All right, I want to bring up Revelation 13.
We're going to do some reading now.
Is everybody is everyone who's serious about this prepared to do a little reading with me?
Is this something we can do?
Can you handle?
Can you handle doing the reading?
I need to get some comments down here saying, yes, I'm prepared to look at some of the reading here
and dive in.
I need some positive feedback here because this is the only way we're going to really dive in
is to understand what's going on in the book of Revelation.
Someone said I can read.
Jesus says I'm unprepared.
Tricia says, yes, let's do it, right?
Let's let's get into it.
Matthew Sandsborough, thank you so much for bringing up the 666.
We're going to get into that.
Let's do it.
John says, J-Dubb, let's do this.
Absolutely, Rachel said.
All right, cool.
All right, we have enough people just letting me know.
Let's jump into this.
So first of all, 666 is not 660 and 6 is not the earliest that the manuscript tradition
has about the beast, the mark of the beast, who is a man.
It was 616 and in 2000, let me just pull this up.
Let me just pull it up.
OK, let's go to Nero.
Here for a second.
Is it this one?
So this is just about Nero, the emperor.
Here's Nero Redivivus.
That's not the one I'm wanting either.
Number of the beast.
Let's go right here.
I hope everybody can at least track me here.
I went with, in case you're wanting to search it yourself, number of the beast.
All you do, you'll find it in Wikipedia and this will give you some good information
to go off of here.
The number of the beast is described in Revelation 13, 15 through 18.
Several translations have been interpreted for the meaning of the phrase.
Here is wisdom.
Let him that have understanding count the number of the beast or the peculiar Greek word.
Is it pastisado?
I'm not sure.
I don't know Greek and at some point I hope to learn it.
Possible translations include to count to reckon to vote or to decide in the Texas
receptas derived from Byzantine type text manuscripts.
The number 666 is represented by the Greek numerals and the Greek letters stigma.
So they go through some examples here.
But what I really wanted to point out is Irenaeus in the 2nd century AD affirmed the
number to be 666 or 6166.
I'm just saying 666 to make it short.
Reported several scribal errors and number theologians have doubts about the traditional
reading because the appearance of the figure 616 in codex F Ramey and this codex is in
the Gregory Island numbering of the net New Testament manuscripts is a manuscript.
The Greek Bible written on parchment.
It contains most of the New Testament.
All right.
And as well as in the Latin version of the Tyconius.
So this is a 4th century North African Latin Christianity manuscript.
And I know there's another one Armenian version.
So you have a Latin version Armenian version.
Irenaeus knew about the 616 reading but did not adopt it.
In 380s correcting the existing Latin language version of the New Testament commonly referred
to as the Vedas Latina Jerome retained 6166 around 2005 a fragment from papyrus 115 taken
from ox syrincus site was discovered at the University of Oxford's Asmolian Museum.
It gave the beast number as 616.
This fragment is the oldest manuscript about 1700 years old of Revelation 13 found as of 2017.
So this identification of this that I think is necessary in Greek isophage if I'm pronouncing
that right and Hebrew Gamatria every letter has a corresponding numeric value summing
these numbers gives a numeric value to a word or name the use of isophsy to calculate
the number of the beast is used in many of the below interpretations.
Preterist theologians typically support the interpretation that 6166 is the numerical
equivalent of the name tighter title Nero Caesar think it's near on Kaiser written in
Aramaic this can be valued at 6166 using the Hebrew numerology of Gamatria and was used
to secretly speak against the emperor.
I think this is important as we're getting into the context of Revelation.
Additionally Nero Caesar in the Hebrew alphabet and I'm not going to stop here is interpreted
numerically represents the number 50 206 50 160 200 which adds up to 6166.
Now I know when we talk about numbers you can make them mean anything you want people
have done this with almost every president of the United States at least since I would
say evangelicalism and its apocalyptic revelation in times fervor has like been on the scene
I mean we can go back into like 70s and I imagine the number equates our current president
and then the new president the new president everybody wants to interpret this but if it
isn't about us and we're looking at when this is written that's the that's the headache
right it isn't about us that's we're wrong Derek Christians wanted to be about them
or the future because if it's not it fails the context is clear.
Now I know there's one German or two German scholars if I'm not mistaken that try to
take an approach this might have been taking place under Hadrian's rule but most consensus
academic scholars who are critical on New Testament studies would suggest that this
book is being written under Domitian's reign and this is significant this this would put
it in the 80s 90s 96 AD approximately a preterist argue that revelation was written before the
destruction of the temple this is how the full preterist and partial preterist want
to do it because it predicts some future things and they want those things to somehow be fulfilled
oftentimes those preterist also want to say it's Jerusalem they want the whole book of
revelation to be talking about Jerusalem if it's not talking about Jerusalem and it's
talking about Rome then it's flopped especially since it starts the book starts about things
which must soon take place about to happen this is like revelation one through one through
three it gets repeated at the end of chapter one into chapter two and the end in chapters
22 where Jesus even says or at least it seems like the Lord says behold I cometh quickly he's
coming quickly it's gonna happen soon these things are near do not seal up the words hold on is it
do not or yes seal up the words of the prophecy for the time is near yeah because Daniel says do
not anyway rambling about that but they say Nero was exiled John to Pat most most scholars
however argue was written after Nero committed suicide in 8068 my thumbnail has like a dagger
in his head our Sunday visitors Catholic encyclopedia has noted the revelation was written
during the latter part of the reign of the Roman emperor the mission probably 8095 96 additional
Protestant scholars are in agreement because some believe revelation 13 speaks of a future
prophetic event and they oftentimes try to attribute it to the Roman Catholic Church which is just
you know wishful thinking this is applying to us in fact a fun fact is that Martin Luther thought
the book probably didn't deserve to be part of canon just like he thought James didn't wasn't
supposed to be part of canon as well till he realized under the persecution that they were
dealing with it and him having to flee into a castle in Germany and he translates the Bible
into German he's like hold on this book might be talking about this Roman Catholic Church
and the beast and the harlot is probably the Pope and all that so they're just kind of
reinterpreting this Athanasius reinterpreted it Eusebius reinterpreted it but the first
Christian church father that I'm aware of and I've been looking into this I talked to you
Lane Pagels about this I talked to others was Irenaeus and he had some friend who died at the
hands of Rome I believe they probably threw him in the gladiator ring or the Coliseum so he thought
okay look at the blood of the saints were the saints and look at what's happening to us by the
Roman Empire so he started to apply it to himself though Christians from its writing up to 180 AD
didn't see this as their scripture or at least we have no evidence of them really seeing this as
scripture and I've even heard to the contrary that they thought this isn't scripture Irenaeus ends up
trying to co-opt it and say actually this is prophesying our day and what's supposed to soon
happen that's when Athanasius comes in reinterpreted it and such I've got a couple of super chats here
the missing 50 is accounted for because of the extra in and near on I'm not aware of the particular
details to this but I have read the scholars on it and they're for sure saying Nero fits the bill
especially when you take into account let me see if I got Revelation 13 pulled up here so the beast
one of the heads of the beast seem to have had a fatal wound and the rumor Nero redivivus that he
killed himself or he was killed or he disappeared some thought he died some thought he didn't die
but he escaped there are various rumors about the myth of Nero that he's coming back but the fatal
wound had been healed the whole world would be filled with wonder and follow the beast trying to
look here and see maybe it's later where it talks about five have fallen one is that's probably
Revelation 17 or 18 let me see I know the mark of the beast which in the Greek to receive a mark
that Greek word there actually I popped that up here somewhere on this it is the stamp that the
Roman Imperial Roman Imperial I guess you'd say the emperors themselves would have used like I don't
I don't see any the only place in the book of Revelation that I would imagine Jerusalem plays a
significant role is Revelation 11 we're talks about the city where a Lord was crucified but it
calls and it calls her a great city but she's called Sodom and Egypt in Revelation 17 the mystery
Babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and the abominations of the earth mystery Babylon
this would be Rome this is like it's so clear to me what's going on I'm actually hoping to have a
conversation with a full preterist Don K Preston about this because he's like nope you're wrong it
is about Jerusalem and I can't wait to see how he's going to try and harmonize this with the
Gospels and have this conversation because I totally disagree with him and I once used to follow
his teaching I used to believe like he did that the book of Revelation was written before 70 AD
and it was all discussing the destruction of Jerusalem but like real big issues when we know
Nero Nero on Kaiser the Beast here is a Roman emperor that is playing a part Revelation 13 but
Rome has no significant role it's all just Jerusalem full preterism to me just there's so
many things that scream issues thank you for that super chat Megan Craig if I'm pronouncing your
last name properly I hope you mentioned Margaret Barker how does her view differ from that of
other scholars what aspects of it do you find convincing or not okay you bring up a really
good question I'm glad you say that because I'm not trying to say that Margaret Barker is not a
brilliant mind I just I just think it's a stretch just like Peter Oaks does he has an article and
I'm gonna share that with you here this article I think is behind a paywall so I'm just sharing with
you what I found here and I'm gonna zoom in if I need to to let you see better
okay let's see someone someone already has jumped on it great point right now I'm not getting
involved in this I'm simply making a point if I wanted to talk about this leader you all know
in the context I'm speaking who I'm discussing it's pretty clear that you get it okay so in that
context John Dominic Crossen said we are making so much to do with this book like we're making up
crap this book anyone who read this in the context in Asia Minor would have gotten this like you did
not take rocket science to see what he's talking about he's talking about Nero and there's it's
just anyone with like a few brain cells that is reading this in its context can recognize that
those are John Dominic Crossen's points and he makes a great point in 2000 years from now though
if I say you know the orange the orange man who is leading the nation under the symbol of the
eagle or something they may or may not understand that they may or may not so he's suggesting that
the return of Jesus the second coming of Jesus may have been working within a model especially in
John's apocalyptic book here the book of Revelation is maybe working off the model of Nero Nero is this
bad evil beast and as recorded in Tacitus Suetonius mentions this in passing that Christians were
blamed for the fire in Rome under Nero how honest how true how big how vivid this is why I recommend
people to read Candida Moss's work or candy Candida I'm not sure how you properly pronounce it but
it's not Candida as I always have there's another proper way to pronounce her name but the myth of
persecution and she will tell you like it's not as prevalent as you suggest or as Christians have
suggested and that maybe there's some exaggeration on the book of Revelation's point John on how
prevalent this persecution was going on there was supposedly a Domitian persecution first
Clement talks about this as well and I think it's mentioned by Irenaeus that first Clement is
describing I I may have these people mixed up but there is a reference that under Domitian there
was a persecution of Christians how wide how prevalent it doesn't matter like if I'm writing a
book and my family alone is persecuted I can paint this universal broad picture about how bad and
evil these people are and that those who are in my family or people who are in my little cult or
group need to watch out the whole world's falling apart and crumbling but the rest of the world may
not be falling apart and crumbling but from my perception in my letter you would read it go
goodness gracious the apocalypse is happening everything on planet Earth is coming to an end
so this idea of Nero coming back is something that wasn't original to Christians this was
something that was original to Jewish thinkers and even in the sibling oracles that are non-Jewish
and are pagan Nero was coming back I refer you to Peter Oaks article on Revelation 17 and how he
references this in the sibling sibling oracle now back to this Nero redivivus legend the legend
was a common belief as late as the fifth century I've heard even sixth century in some sources
meaning all the way in the fifth sixth century Christians and people around the empire are
still thinking Nero's coming back I mean for 500 freaking years Nero's coming back Nero's coming
back Nero's coming back I mean for that's like saying Jesus is coming back Jesus is coming back
Jesus is coming back and they still hold on to it to today the belief was he's the result
or cause of several imposters who posed as Nero leading rebellions we're going to get into that
this is interesting this was such a serious myth that people were pretending to be Nero
now I want to make one note about Christians who say Jesus is coming back some of the more
apocalyptic second coming you know 88 reasons Jesus will come back in 1988 all of these kind of
evangelical Christians oftentimes notice they're using political leaders in their scheme of like
one is and one is fallen and he'll be coming back and all of that they may not use Nero in it but
they're still using political figures modern contemporary evangelicals to fit the bill in
their prophecy on the book of Revelation which is just going to fail as well it's never going to end
I'm taking my hat off I'm getting too hot okay I'm still up with the screen here several variations
of the legend exist playing on both hopes excuse me let me go back to this um playing on both hope
and fear of Nero's return get this some were afraid that Nero was coming back and others hoped he was
coming back especially the east but we'll get into that the earliest written version of this legend
is found in the sibling oracles it claims that Nero did not really die but fled to Parthia which
is the eastern it's beyond the eastern part of the Roman Empire the Parthians are what we would say
the Persians in Persia where he would amass a large army and would return to Rome to destroy it
now when I say sibling oracles once again I refer you back there's pagan non-Christian
Roman oracles or Greek Roman oracles here there's Jewish and there's Christian and they all are
writing similar Christian or similar sorry sibling oracles it claims that Nero did not really die
but fled to Parthia I already read that Dio Chrysostom a Greek philosopher and historian wrote seeing
that even now everybody wishes Nero were still alive imagine you have a bad president some people
thought that Trump was that we brought this up earlier right and they're like I just wish this
person would come back and kick him out of office right you you use that that bad person to want
to kick them out of the office or you might see them as a good person but those on the opposite
side who might be favoring Trump are hoping the reverse that it kicks the butt of the other people
it's the same thing that's been going on for thousands of years so uh and the great majority
do believe that he he still is although in a certain sense he has died not once but often
along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive Augustine of Hippo wrote
that some believed he now lives in concealment in the vigor of that same age which he had reached
when he was believed to have perished and we live until he is revealed in his own time and
restored to his kingdom in later forms of the legend among many early Christians the legend
shifted to a belief that Nero was the antichrist so that just later they they kind of fit the
bill of Nero being the antichrist this is a fun fact this was so serious this whole idea that
Nero is coming back at least three Nero imposters emerged leading rebellions the first who sang and
played the Sathara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor appeared
in 69 during the reign of Vitilius during the reign of Titus there was another imposter who
appeared in Asia and also sang to the to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero
but he too was exposed 20 years after Nero's death during the reign of Domitian there was a
third pretender supported by the Parthians who hardly could be persuaded to give him up the matter
almost came to war some Bible scholars see the description of the wounding and the healing of
the beast in Revelation 13 3 and the mention of the eighth king who is also one of the earlier
seven kings in Revelation 17 8 through 11 as allusions to Nero Redivivus legend so does John
Dominic Crossen I figure I'd bring this up because this is important if we want to know
what's going on in this book that's highly symbolic all right did I miss any super chats
I'm just scrolling up because we've got almost 300 people in the chat and I want to make sure I get
you covered here looks like we didn't as far as I can tell help me out who who says they were
imposters I mean you could dive deeper and go in and look at who the claimants were but three of
them running around interesting and look today right the guy I interviewed from Australia the
Australian Jesus he claims to be the return of Jesus that he's back like so does the Russian one
there's a guy in Russia who claimed he's now imprisoned I believe but there's people who are
claiming to be Jesus return sounds like a common motif that humans develop and I would be curious
to know where the idea of someone dying and coming back comes from that does this predate Nero's
idea I wouldn't be shocked right if there's like a motif in mythology or I won't even say mythology
as if it's just some fake thing humans believe they're going to come back like how common and
prevalent is that we have Jesus in the chat right now I mean come on everybody we know
this is a common thing right all right I'm going to pop up the book this is the copy that John
Dominic Crossen sent me which by the way is not the final published version and he told me I am
allowed to reveal this copyrighted material for the world to see this is part of his book
render unto Caesar and I want everybody who's read this book and who hasn't in that will
understand the front cover of this book what page are we on here let me just remember this all right
I'm going to try to keep that highlighted to show you the front cover all right you see this book
render unto Caesar the struggle for christ and culture in the new testament this coin right here
has the image of this beast if you will all right I'm just going to call it that or of at least one
of the heads of the beast and this right here of course is Caesar um um not augustus but Caesar
Tiberius Tiberius Caesar but in this on this coin right here he spends a lot of time god
Sebastian's Kaiser god worship Kaiser like he is claiming to be am I sharing the screen yeah okay
I am he is claiming to be god like or a son of god who is deserving of worship here like this is the
emperor and a coin is given to jesus whether this is historic or not I don't care this is a book
everybody should read for fun this is a great book and he says whose image do you see on the
coin the first thing Dom says is notice Jesus doesn't even have a coin he says hand me one of those
coins so he doesn't even participate in carrying the coin of the emperor who claims to be son of
god and deserves worship and he says whose image do you see on this coin well we see the Caesar
render unto god that which is gods and if you take his point that this would have been the coin
he this guy's claiming to be god he's separating there's a whisper of trees and as Dom says
render unto god that which is gods and render unto Caesar that which is Caesars okay so he's
dividing god and Caesar in his response saying god and Caesar deserve their own stuff and Caesar
ain't god number one because that is what the coin is trying to address the book of revelation
constantly talks about not taking the mark of the beast i'm going to do this so you can at least
see my face while i'm doing this not to participate don't take the mark of the beast on your right
hand or forehead where you're where the law of god was supposed to be written
i think that they would um symbolize the forehead for where you know you can even see
Jews wearing the box on their forehead today i think it's Hasidic Jews that do this but they
also wrap their right hand with a leather strap i wish i had a video to show you this but i was
there in Jerusalem recently and they're rocking at the western wall tilting left up toward the holy
of holies where on the temple mount i actually visited this just recently anyway right hand
forehead you see Jews do this but this was a very Hebrew idea and participating with the
whore of Babylon mystery Babylon would have been accommodating Rome and here's Jesus saying
whose inscription do you see give to Caesar that which is he's but give to god that which is god
Caesar ain't god buddy like this is what John would say that this is clearly implying i've
heard other interpretations but this makes a lot of sense now um let me get back to
where we were that's uh where we at that's one okay okay there we are the once and future beast
can everybody see that in the smaller let me zoom in let's do this that way you can actually see
what's going on that way i'm up on the screen i feel like i feel like uh it may be a little too
small for some people i can go back to small let me know if smaller is better and i'll be happy
to accommodate you render that which is to myth visions uh chat and uh render that which is to
Derek Derek let me know which one we need to render two more because i can reduce my face to
this and then boom i could do that we got one compliment saying that looks good i'm fine with
being small here i you guys see enough of me all right the once and future beast twice and only
twice in the entire book of revelation John pauses and directly addresses his readers with these
uh peremptory warnings this calls for wisdom let him who let anyone with understanding calculate
the number of the beast for it is the number of a person it's number six hundred sixty and six
this calls for mind that has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is
seated also they are seven kings having reached those places readers are over halfway through
the book and it seems a little late to call for understanding and wisdom for recipients already
reeling under the call it call it a scopic scopic onslaught of john's ever-changing metaphorical
imagery but granted that we must still pay attention to those who those two texts in their
immediately surrounding context for what for what is such special insight needed at those particular
places and do they both refer to the same mysterious subject furthermore how will wisdom
and understanding about them help answer this chapter's questions about john's model for his
vision of christ's coming as an imperial devastation despite the ex exultant pax ramada i love that
about dom he takes the pax ramada the roman imperial cult he's checking out the greek he's
looking in the greco- roman world he's seeing how it's been used and how revelation would be
once again adopting these ideas to begin reread the former admonition once more notice it's triple
structure the number of the beast the number the person is number six six six in what follows we
will look at the identity of the person coded six hundred sixteen six and why that person is termed
the beast or the better or better the beast how do we establish the identity of that person coded by
the number six hundred sixteen six depends on a process called gematria invented to my mind by
people with too much time on their hands sorry dom with this humor i agree gematria signs numerical
values to letters so that a word always has a numerical equivalent the 22 letters and five letter
variants of the hebrew alphabet for example are assigned gematria numbers as follows the first
nine letters get numbers one through nine the next nine letters get numbers 10 through 90
and the final nine letters get numbers one through 100 through 900 anyway um based on what
jewish tradition the imperial person coded by the number six hundred sixteen six is the emperor
nero who ruled from 54 to 68 cce his full titular name was nero claudius caesar augustus germanicus
which is abbreviated in english as nero kaiser or in transcribed hebu as nr w in k or q sorry s r
then according to the hebrew gematria n is 50 r is 200 w six n is 50 q is 100 s is 60 and r is 200
as nero kaiser is nero caesar is commentatively identified as 6166 and then in the fifth sibling
oracle so just getting through here a jewish apocalyptic apocalypse contemporary with the
christian one of john this text needs some introduction as it will be of great comparative
significance throughout this chapter first in the triangular pentatives above the windows of
michael angelo's magnificent sistine chapter chapel are five female figures called sibles
one of wheat one each from persia egypt rom but two from greece including the most famous of them all
the ecstatic oracular prophetess at delphi interspersed with those unnamed female sibles
are seven named male prophets jonah jeremiah ezekiel joel zechariah isiah and daniel for michael
angelo's prophets and sibles jews and gentiles that is the whole world both foretold and awaited
the advent of god's role on earth so pretty much he's combining the jewish and the rest of the
known world to combine jews and gentiles in this in the art and i think that i think john
dominacrossan has pictures that he has took in these locations that he's visited himself
sibles were the gentile equivalent of the jewish prophets both kinds of visionaries announced
the future under divine inspiration although oracles or pronouncements by sibles were originally a
gentile creation from 100 bc to 600 ce they were adopted and adapted by the jewish and christian
traditions which produced their own sibling oracles we met two jewish sibling oracles earlier
and this is his book so you gotta like read the book get the book uh render undeceaser
by john dominacrossan this is one of my favorite parts by the way of the book even though there's
some really good stuff about luke ax and paul and really the whole book's worth a read the
fifth sibling oracle begins by recounting the woeful history of the latin race from its origins
to the late second century sibling oracle five one in this list imperial rulers are not identified
directly by name but indirectly by their first initials given numerically in greek gematria
nero is described as one who has 50 as an initial once again in is given the number 50 by gematria
in hebru or greek well over a hundred years later another but pro- roman jewish author copied that
section on the emperors and identified nero once again as another man of the number 50
all the sources i love that he's given us the sources granted then that 666 codes that
the roman emperor nero why is he also the beast is that just nasty name calling they go low we go
lower and the christian bible the beast appears twice in daniel seven six but then appears reappears
over 30 times throughout revelation the first teaser mentioned is as the beast that comes
up from the bottomless pit but then after that semi introduction the beast appears a dozen times in
revelation 13 whereas we just saw it is climatically identified as the emperor nero we begin therefore
with john's biblical basis in daniel seven in daniel's night vision four beasts four great
beasts come up out of the sea different from one another the first was like a lion a second one
that looked like a bear another appeared like a leopard those beasts represent three great great
past empires the lion is the babelonian or chaldean empire ruled by nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar
the bear is the median empire ruled by the alleged derrius the mead and or derrius a mead
the leopard is the persian empire represented by syrish the person
or syrish of persia based on daniel's vision john saw beast rising out of the sea having seven heads
and the beast that i saw was like a leopard its feet were like a bears its mouth was like a lion's
mouth revelation 13 1 to 3 in daniel three predatory wild beast designated successive empires
but john combined all three into his single sea beast namely the roman empire itself which is why
i brought up if you're a if you're a commentary person who really wants source material gk bill
takes the approach and i'm not sure if he's correct in revelation 17 but he tries to combine the
empires it's like rom is like the culmination of all the empires out there and he in uh peter oaks
and within his commentary says look the seven hilled city like this is rome and it's always
been known this in the context of the first century i had a recent christian on facebook named mystery
apologist um trying to argue the book of revelation is about a greecean kingdom because
the book of daniel is talking about greece this greek kingdom being the last kingdom
so like cognitive dissonance would force you to have to make the last kingdom if you want daniel
to not be wrong into a greek kingdom so revelation how do we square that with the greek kingdom
like there's so much flipping around going on but like we have to ignore the seven hilled city
which is commonly over and over referred to as rome mystery babalon who's drunk with the blood
of the saints now i can imagine full preterist trying to refer back to matthew let me go back
to full screen here we can come back to reading in a moment but i can already imagine when i was
reading and listening to full preterist they'd go to revelation 17 and talk about the woman
who's drunk with the blood of the saints and they would say oh look who's guilty of the blood
who's guilty of the blood of jesus the jews and matthew and they want to argue that somehow this
fits but when you look at the context the greek words there are completely different from martyrs
in revelation and prophets that we see in matthew so they're not even the same greek word and
this tradition ends up becoming christians martyrs who also killed christians according to
sutonius tacitus other authors who were talking about mero killing christians and blaming them
for the fire in rome according to iranis who's saying that how prevalent this is i'm not i'm
not even trying to debate that i'm saying this is what was being said and it's not just christian
authors that say it that rome was doing this stuff i mean how guilty is rome in this and
are the christians hard-headed and realizing they shouldn't break laws by going into public
places teaching stuff when there are laws against it i don't know i mean i wasn't there i can't say
but at the end of the day seems that rome is pretty much being blamed often and why does nero
pop up if rome is not being guilty with this beast leading this empire revelation 17 also talks about
this this woman mystery babalon and rome if we go ahead and situate rome as this thing that it has
10 client kings or 10 um is it crowns which equal kings like they're client kings and they rule the
land and all of the trade that goes on in revelation 18 with all the myrrh and gold and this and that
the wood like this is stuff we know that jerusalem is not participating in this is stuff that rome
was doing and a lot of those items are commonly prevalent in rome some of those objects though
if you look at scripture you could tell that john whoever this author is
he's like copying and like mimicking hebrew scripture to fit his narrative in revelation
so he is whoever this author is is like ezekiel okay eat the scroll revelation um 10 where it's
talking about eating the little scroll okay he eats the scroll and then oh okay and there's another
place where it's like they tie a millstone around the scroll in one of these situations and throw it
into the sea so that it sinks that's prophetic so you kind of have to know your hebrew bible to
really get what's going on in revelation that's why i also think barker margaret barker's mistaken
on identify mystery babalon as jerusalem is when you just look over and over in the hebrew bible
at these kingdoms and the language being used in revelation 17 and 18
neneva is the great city it's called um
the other great city it's in peter oaks's uh article neneva comes up again and again by the way
in revelation as an example of a reference because the prophets are using the same thing
anyway um what i was saying was gk bill check him out let me see if i've caught up um make it sure
if there were any super chats i don't want anyone's name not being written in the lambs book of life
which you know when you super chat you enter and it helps us here at myth vision
scrolling just to make sure that i didn't leave anybody hanging here
nope all right looks good feel free if you have any questions comments whatever you want to say i'm
i don't know what i'm talking about feel free to super chat critiques anything like that i'm game
um let's get back to john domino crossing because this is fun okay so the sea this beast that's
combined with all the different things that we find in daniel he's just carrying the tradition
of daniel because that scripture to him is the roman empire but then john immediately shifts the
imagery from the roman empire in general to particular part of it one of its heads seem to
have received a death blow but its mortal wound had been healed revelation 13 three one of the
heads of the beast designates one emperor of the roman empire by but which one and why is he
described as surviving a fatal wound in the next section john moves from sea beast the roman empire
to land beast the roman emperors i saw another beast that rose up out of the earth it's it
exercises all authority of the first beast on its behalf but once again john moves immediately
from emperors in general to that same particular emperor singled out before this land beast
makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose mortal wound had been healed
revelation 13 12 and deceives the inhabitants of the earth telling them to make an image for the
beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived this special emperor was mortally wounded
and yet is healed and alive the beast morphs from roman empire as sea beast to roman emperors as
land beast but in both cases moves immediately to focus on one emperor described as wounded
but healed and finally identified as nero in other words for john the beast is an imperial
conglomerate involving the roman empire in general the roman emperors in particular
and the emperor nero as a special case i love how he just solves the riddles and it makes so much
sense i mean this the best interpretation i've seen out there on explaining all this is this kind
of explanation any lane pagals follows in the same thought uh she may identify and highlight
other things that john dominant doesn't hear um the same goes for adela colin's other academics gk
bill like read scholarship and then if you're going to tell me that none of this has anything to do
with roam like at least source all the academics that are clearly identifying it as roam and then
say why all of them are wrong about all of it and uh peter oaks takes a jab and a polite one of
scholarly jab at margaret barker in his article by suggesting that um margaret barker skips right
over revelation 17 six in one of those passages it mentions how this beast the the one sitting on
the seven hills literally rules all the kings and nations of the earth from every tribe nation king
like like jerusalem never ruled anything i mean this is the point right john is a jew post war i
would add and he's traumatized what happened in 70 ad revelation seven i think is speaking of
the jerusalem uh temple in jerusalem that was destroyed by the romans in 70 and he calls it
sodam in egypt maybe we need to pull up that example to show you why i think that
so i i agree that you know revelation has jerusalem as a great city mentioned here
i don't want to go on record acting like i don't see that i see that but i'm being very
careful here because i not only engage with christians every day i see it oh the revelation and
you might even be the anti christ yourself derrick i mean like i get everything under the sun
as to what's going on here but i also engage and have come out of full preterism and partial
preterism where gary demar kenneth gentry arcy sprawl you name it these guys all try to interpret
this as jerusalem and try to argue pre 70 ad for dating the book of revelation now we're going to
present i'll come back to you john dominant crossing my wonderful friend and i will definitely
highlight some more of your stuff i was given a read like a measuring rod and was told go and
measure the temple of god and the altar and its worshipers this full preterist partial
preterist try to act like this is evidence that john literally had a measuring rod and went to the
jerusalem temple in jerusalem and measured out the temple because it's still standing
all you have to do is look back at his eheel because he's very scriptural minded he uses
so much allegory symbolism and scripture and he's being shown a vision so it's very difficult to
sit here and die on a hill and act like all this is evidence that revelation was written before 70
anyone who has to die on that hill and i don't have to die at all on that hill but if you absolutely
are stuck and you're like i gotta see this as the jerusalem temple in 70 and that he's still
a lot like this temple still standing when he measures it then what you need to do is say
okay maybe this text is a rolling text meaning the book of revelation wasn't written in 68 or 69
it wasn't written in 96 it was written over time i don't buy it but it's a possibility i'm not going
to say there weren't things that were added into it later that's possible i just don't see it as a
rolling text there may be things that were inserted though personally i don't i don't go with that i
think it's pretty well organized and if you read adela colin's book and how it's how it's organized
you would say most of this book is not like that so if you read ezekiel is ezekiel going to the
jerusalem temple literally walking around with a measuring rod and like doing this or is he in a
heavenly vision measuring the temple this is something worth examining but exclude the outer
court the court of the gentiles do not measure it because it has been given to the gentiles
okay why i mean maybe there's some hebraism here maybe maybe there's no need to measure it i'm not
so sure but i would suggest that this is just talking about the roman war in 70 they will
trample on the holy city for 42 months and i will appoint my two witnesses and they will
prophesy for 1260 days clothed in sackcloth they are the two olive trees and the two lamp sands
and they stand before the lord of the earth if anyone tries to harm them fire comes from their
mouths and devours their enemies this is how anyone who wants to harm them must die they have
power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying
and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague
as often as they want i don't know about you but i'm not convinced that sounds literal and if it is
then it's some future expectation that hasn't happened and therefore you read revelation one
revelation 22 it was supposed to happen soon never happened so it fell but who are these two witnesses
man you can go on youtube type google or watch youtube videos there's a billion people interpreting
the two witnesses are this and this guy and this coming on this like for me i would look at some
prophets maybe elijah and moses or someone like that enok in elijah elijah calls fire down from
heaven which is why he comes to mind but who knows who gives a hoot now when they have finished their
testimony the beast that comes up from the abyss will attack them and overpower and kill them
their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city which figuratively called
Sodom and Gomorrah not mystery Babylon Sodom and Gomorrah is this figurative language being
called for the city where also their lord was crucified so where was Jesus crucified
Jerusalem according to the gospel counts and sounds to me like he's trying to argue that this is
Jerusalem for three and a half days some of every people tribe language and nation will gaze on their
bodies and refuse them burial the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate
by sending each other gifts because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth
this sounds highly symbolic to me but it does sound like the Jerusalem temple
after three and a half days the breath of life from god entered them and they stood on their feet
and terror struck those who saw them then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying saying to them
come up here they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies looked on at that very hour
there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed seven thousand people were killed
in the earthquake and the survivors were terrified and they gave glory to the god of heaven sorry
that i'm rambling quick but there's so much here and it's easy to get bogged down in this
okay first timothy too while others are saying like paul don't even don't even if you're married
don't even act like you're married only marry if you're burning with lust like you absolutely
have to so that you're not you know sinning um whatever that even means because there's
there's a lot involved in this but anyway um therefore i want men everywhere to pray lifting
up hands without without anger we're disputing i also want women to dress modesty with decency and
propriety adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles Jesus honey honey you're gonna have
to stop dressing up you haven't read your bible this is this is bs we actually had a guy who
walked by our house back in 2007 or 2008 and he said who are you voting for this year i'm doing a
country accent because we were in north carolina he was kind of country and uh at the time i can't
remember who the president was we were talking about who we were gonna vote for he was vote for
jesus christ and then he goes are you wearing makeup to my wife some old man walking on the street
and uh she's like looked at me like what he's like yeah uh delilah wore makeup and that's the wicked
you know blah blah blah blah and i'm like what's like this guy was off his rocker and then a few
years later i found out he was a neighbor of my mom down the street he had a stroke or what not
something happened i don't know but weird anyway or gold or pearls i'm gonna have to have a talk with
my wife or expensive clothes okay so now you're talking about me sometimes depending on what i
decided to wear but i think he's addressing women right so oh no is this men oh no this is women
this is women man we're lucky i'm glad the misogynies you know helping us men out here um
but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship god a woman should learn
in quietness and full submission i do not permit a woman to teach or assume authority over a man
she must be quiet for adam was formed first remember that ladies come on and then eve
and adam was the one uh not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and because became
a sinner but women will be saved through childbearing so like you better pop out those babies if you
plan on making it to heaven everybody pretty pretty obvious stuff so here you have the 144,000
virgins right and it could be taken literally because there was a real issue in the early church
about sex and who should and shouldn't even marcia knights were like really careful about
how they were supposed to act even though the heresiologist would condemn them and say they'd
have night orgies they were doing all sorts of debauchery sexual acts to each other and blah
blah blah or you could interpret this is a highly symbolic thing about the armies of god in heaven
and um they're symbolically virgins i say that because they have not participated
with the whore of babalon so there's a lot of sex language revelation 17 mystery babalon the whore
she's sitting on the throne blah blah blah she's guilty of the blood or drinking the blood of the
saints etc and they call her whore which would mean she's promiscuous and people who are
participating with her are committing adultery and fornication with her even the condemnation
revelation three when he's addressing the church as an asia minor which church was this
revelation three i think let me double check we're gonna we're gonna pop this up i'm going back to
to the text church and sardis church in philadelphia
he says i am coming soon jesus constantly lets these people know according to this letter this
book a revelation that he's coming soon synagogue of satan and claim to be jews but they are not
but they're liars where is it at where it talks about them fornicating and eating meat sacrifice
to idols leo desia
so because you are lukewarm neither hot nor cold okay did i miss it or something i may have passed
it eat meat sacrifice to idols which paul permits by the way so this author would totally disagree
with paul on meat eating eating meat sacrifice to idols is the next chapter let's try four
um the throne in heaven no so i missed it let's go to two church in Ephesus
all right uh you hate the practices of the nicolations which i also hate i'm curious to
know who the nicolations are um a synagogue of satan again keeps talking about the synagogue of satan
church of pergamum i think this would be the one
they're among you hold to the teachings of belem or teaching of belem who taught belek to entice
the israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality
is this talking about literal sexual immorality or is this talking about in participation with
this beast when there's constantly the throne of satan synagogue of satan uh they're participating
with rome he has this huge phobia of rome it seems and and taking the mark and participating with her
and fornicating with her and stuff and if you do then your name will get blotted out of the lambs
book of life i appreciate everybody i seriously do um i hope you'll hit the like button share this
out with somebody who wants to understand the mark of the beast let's say they run around and they're
they're always seeing oh no my receipt says six dollars and 66 cents it's an omen it's the mark
of the beast or people who have crazy ideas like really they should investigate this in its context
but i understand like i said at the open in this live stream most people turn it off if it isn't about them
