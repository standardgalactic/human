Welcome to the water, boys
It becomes clear the more you know, you realize you don't know much.
This universe is quite complex from the human perception.
Everything from big to small has its connection somehow.
We just may not see it.
We are ants in an ant farm, trying to understand things way beyond the barriers of the farm
we live inside.
We can apply this to the idea of God.
What is God?
It seems like forever a man has fought, killed, sacrificed, debated, constructed, and done
about everything towards a God or gods.
Is there a common thread that runs through all ancient stories, cultures, structures,
rituals, or even gods?
I'm asking that you open your mind please.
Take this moment to just be open minded to the possibility that something bigger could
be going on throughout history.
A wise Buddhist saying, if one desires to know the truth then one holds no opinions.
I believe this is true of everyone.
We are all on this journey together.
Now here are a few quotes from some famous mathematicians in history.
Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe, Galilea.
The uniform character of mathematics is the essence of science, for mathematics is the
foundation of all exact scientific knowledge, David Hilbert.
Geometry is one, an eternal shining in the mind of God, that men share in it is among
the reasons that man is the image of God, Johannes Kepler.
This is the language in which the gods speak of people or to people.
The knowledge of which geometry aims is the knowledge of the eternal, Plato.
Actually, everything that can be known has a number, for it is impossible to grasp anything
with the mind or to recognize it without this, phylo, phylo-less, is that right, phylo-less.
I believe I'm pronouncing that correct.
There may be babblers, wholly ignorant of mathematics, who dare to condemn my hypothesis.
Upon the authority of some, part of the Bible twisted to suit their purpose.
I value them not and scorn their unfounded judgment.
Nicholas Copernicus.
A wise man speaks because he has something to say, a fool because he has something to
say, quoted in the Decimal Wisdom.

Now, turning this over to the magnificent Dr. Luther G. Williams, Dr.
Well, Derek, I think the information we have is utterly magnificent, and it'll help us
all to discover our inner magnificence, if you can say that.
You know, it's sometimes hard, I guess, for us to think about a world without the Internet.
We've had it forever, it seems like.
But even back in those days, our special guest that we have on the show today was an avid
fan of documentaries on television and radio.
His name is Alan, and every chance that this young man would get, he would exercise his
passion for gaining information and organizing it.
He's always had a keen interest in history, especially hidden or lost history, as well
as mythology and religion.
Now, Alan first worked in the field of construction manufacturing, and he might have stayed there,
but in 2010, he was diagnosed with a serious illness that steered him away from the construction
business and in the direction he'll be taking us today.
It was the series Secrets in Plain Sight by Scott Anstotz that inspired Alan to begin
his own research into sacred geometry some six years ago.
And since then, he's been working nonstop, presenting his own research as well as that
of others.
And he has published on YouTube, Derek, some 800 videos on sacred geometry.
That's right.
You heard right.
800 videos since 2012, which works out to about 133 videos per year or one video every
three days.
So he's been busy.
So the water boys have the pleasure of introducing to you, or if you're already familiar with
this work presenting to you, this wonderful man who stopped by with a truckload of information
and insights.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome warmly Alan, sacred geometry decoded.
Hello, Lufthansa, hello, Derek, thank you for inviting me and I'm looking forward to
sharing what are some insights and hopefully sparking some thoughts and keen to see your
reactions and how it all links up.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
Well, with all you have to offer, that's guaranteed, I tell you, let's start off with
a general question that I think is probably on everybody's minds.
And that is, how do you define this field of sacred geometry?
Because I suspect that a lot of people are more familiar with it than they think, but
they may not know it as sacred geometry.
So what would be a concise definition of what we're talking about here?
I think that's at the core question and one of the biggest issues because sacred geometry
is a relatively new term and a short time on the internet with a few searches of sacred
geometry, you'll find quite a variation of what it means, how people apply it and what
they think about it.
But I think, at essence, to know what it is, is firstly to look at all of them collectively
and see if there are certain common threads that are shared by all practitioners, believers
or people interested in sacred geometry and there are some very clearly defined ones.
So the issue in itself, if we could start, would be even the term sacred geometry.
The term sacred can be, that in itself is a word that's hard to define and it will also
turn some people off, but it brings some people in, but it is a very ill-defined term as where
I think we can begin with geometry and the common threads that people share.
So whether it's the vesica pisces or the flower of life, you'll see these symbols connected
and drawn and all sorts of animations and people examining those aspects in more geometric
ways.
That ancient architecture would be another thread, which would be often shared by people
with an interest in what's generally termed sacred geometry.
It will often be connected and so I'm sure a lot of people have heard about the 4-3-2
versus 4-4-D concert pitch tuning, which would be a musical aspect.
And this will also apply to, let's say, the great cathedrals, for instance, of Europe,
which places such as Chartres Cathedral also seem to be places that draw in the researches
of this general area.
And I think so, to know exactly what sacred geometry is out of a very broad term, we look
at the key of the common threads that join them and that this would be astronomy because
of the astronomical alignments of whether it's the pyramids or whether it's cathedrals.
We see this as a common thread.
Music and acoustics, because a cathedral would be a classic example of a building itself
would be tuned to have the most inspiring musical effects and to capture the sound and
to, just like a concert hall, would be applied the same way.
This is through the use of proportions and measurement, but generally under architecture
and this is part of an ancient tradition, which, from the great cathedrals, again going
back in time, you'll see certain themes repeated in architecture.
So geometry and music, arithmetic and sacred number, so numbers such as 4, 3, 2, 108, these
might be numbers that people are familiar with in the Bible, as we've spoken in preparation
for this, numbers such as 144 or 153, especially pronounced and well-known amongst Bible numbers,
but this is part of an aspect, again, which goes back in time, cross cultures, across
the world and is able to be seen but measured and that's why I've got this image here and
I think this is one of the keys of exactly what sacred geometry is.
I think whatever people, however they apply themselves to it, whatever they can draw from
it in a beneficial way is great, but the common threads amongst sacred geometry really begins
with geometry.
The term geometry itself implies a system of measurement.
For instance, G.O. is Earth and Metri is Measure, that's where the origin of the word
meter is to measure and so geometry itself means Earth measurement, which would apply
to this greater theme of sacred geometry and so it's weights and measures, whether it's
measurements of length such as the 12-inch foot, the 360-degree compass, pan scales for
measuring gold and silver or precious spices, but even just common goods such as grain or
wine, but also time is a measurement and what you'll also find is that temperature is a
measurement and somehow even amongst these ancient systems we'll find a pattern of number
which is going to link weights and measures such as these instruments here and these instruments
themselves are the basis of modern science.
So all technology we have now is built around a system of weights, measures and mathematics
and these are the core themes which define ancient civilizations, but we can find the
same ancient pattern repeating even in the allegedly modern secular world and so sacred
numbers are still emerging even in the most secular scientific situations.
Now Alan, just something to touch on here, our audience may or may not be listening through
audio or video so I kind of clarified in the intro that they'd be able to track either
way, so we may have visual aid here but everything you explain is pretty easy to hear and understand
as well which I love that about your content.
It sounds to me and to put this in a nutshell we're talking about earth measurement which
earth measurement isn't just measuring something like what you would think about ground in
a modern context, just something like a tree to a tree, yeah that might be part of it,
but it's everything that encompasses us on this earth, everything that is in our existence
if you will could be part of this measurement system dealing from man to nature, time, weights,
sound, I mean you name it and so all of these things just to put it in a nutshell we find
within the Bible, we find within ancient literature not just the Bible and we see a common thread
not only in the ancient world but in these texts that do not make these texts necessarily
exclusive and divisive like oh we've got the answer you don't but rather kind of shows
a common thread if I'm not mistaken and this might be going into an interpretive field
which you're not trying to do but I'm asking the audience to be open to thinking what does
this mean for our interpretive methods that's all I'm asking so I'm going to go ahead and
mute and...
Okay well, so I think we have these common threads that everyone would agree is shared
amongst sacred geometry and generally term sacred numbers but especially for those people
who are even secular let's say or materialist that the importance of this particular system
is that it can be measured, it can be tested and you can see it repeated throughout the
past but we'll also be able to see it actually predicting major new buildings as they're
being constructed or major new city plans so that it's still happening now but the pattern
is again something can be measured, counted and tested but and we'll certainly see it
in ancient India, in the Malayan culture, in biblical tradition but also we'll find
it in ancient Egypt also ancient stone circles and as well as other stone sites such as the
Karnak alignments in France as well and what we have is a very particular pattern I think
and the repeated elements is music, geometry, arithmetic and astronomy, the quadrillion
vein being at least those which can be sort of clearly measurable but I think but also
one of the most powerful arguments for this as I have this illustration here is that it's
basically showing a man with his arms out, now this goes back to this ancient Greek
well-recorded principle but we'll see evidence for it in older civilizations but just to begin
with the Greco-Roman period because we have such clear documentation, textbooks such as
the Trudius's ten books of architecture or the works of Heron which describe all the
elements of architecture but also alchemy and basically it's an engineering textbook and
it's written in a way that is clearly understandable to us now, there's evidence for
instance in hieroglyphs of these types of events but they don't read as a science textbook,
they're very poetic and a lot of people believe that there's actually quite a bit of scientific
knowledge hidden in there but I'd just like to stay with where we have very clear repeated
texts and there are a few especially Greek and Roman works whether it's the geometry
of Euclid so that's probably still the world's most popular widely spread distributor book
is Euclid's elements which is the basics of geometry and this has been in constant
publication across all religions that have had access to it for 2,000 years so it's still
a textbook now for geometry, we have the ten books of architecture by the Trudius which
is a textbook of the philosophy of architecture of town planning but it's also an engineering
textbook of how to build machines to lift heavy move and lift heavy stones on a full book
its interior design and the weights and measure system so the image varies a man with his arms
out because the concept is that and for instance Greek temples would be designed on the principle
of the perfect proportions of an idealized person and so if you have fingertip to fingertip
should be your height so you have a symmetry that's happening there but what I have is we have
apparently unconnected units of measure coming together so firstly that quote by
Protagoras that man is the measure of all things and this is a concept in geometry we would look
at the geometry of the human and you could describe it in with geometric forms but everything
will connect as well to measurements and proportions which will I don't will lead to
larger connections now for instance the ancient the qubit that I'm describing here is actually
the ancient Egyptian royal qubit which was used to define the pyramids so what we have now is the
allegedly modern meter or find that this is actually quite ancient and connects to ancient units
of measurement so we have a meter we have an Egyptian royal qubit and we have one foot so
an Egyptian royal qubit plus one meter equals exactly five feet therefore an English foot plus
an Egyptian ancient Egyptian royal qubit plus one meter equals six feet and that in itself will
equal 72 inches or 216 grains and so you might ask well what's the grain an inch is made of
free barley corn that's been that was an ancient definition so what you'll find is that still now
ceremonially at least that unit such as the inch or ounces are defined by a number of grains
because a wheat grain or a barley grain would be of a similar size and similar weight so you
could make a good approximate but it was more complicated than that the king or the local
Lord would have a set of weights for instance and weights would be tested but as a general rule
you could say that one inch was free barley corn and so many barley corn added together would be
an official ounce so being a definition of potcoins did you have something you were trying to say
Luther yeah Alan you were talking about all these connections and that man is the measure of all
things it is true not only in in sacred geometry but also in science you may be familiar with the
work of Naseem Haramein who's a theoretical physicist and he published a paper some years back
on the Swartz child proton and and what he found is that in the measurement of all things from
the very small to the very large man is right in the middle human beings are are are exactly in the
center of things and that's exactly what what man was considered in the medieval world you know
the the measure of everything and he was an analogy to however big you could get or however small
you could get but I wanted to ask you this when we think of the Bible and say in all sacred texts
really we think about the Trivium rather than the quadrivium or at least I tend to do it as a
reflex right we think about logic grammar rhetoric those sorts of things but you're talking about
the quadrivium which deals with things that can be measured geometry astronomy music and
arithmetic what do we learn by handling sacred texts this way isn't that a rather unfamiliar
approach to take to a sacred text and you know what do you say to two people who say well that's
the creator's direct communication with his creation it's mine to mine it's not something to
measure and to observe this is a different way of looking at sacred texts isn't it well actually
I think the beauty of what's happening with the system is that it's actually a series of levels
of information brought together so I think there's a you can view it and I must admit I have a very
specific I would say it to an extent narrow view at which I'm approaching it because I want to
look into the tent what is the testable what is the measurable but also whether we have clear
documentation and where can we get exact measures to to repeat this so I've basically I've tried
to be forensic as possible with the examination what I've been looking for and I can't avoid the
fact that well I'll bring in the we have the seven liberal arts I'll bring up the some images
there and so that's one where we have grammatic well grammar dialect logic and rhetoric music
arithmetic geometry and astronomy so these are some standard images of where do those come from
those pictures like those those look like those are ancient art like like someone actually had
that inscribed somewhere yeah well so the exact origin of the seven liberal arts officially speaking
will appear around about the 11th 12th 13th century just at the same time that the great
cathedrals started to be built in in Europe and what we had is a Europe was coming out of the
dark age it had been in for a while so just before the Renaissance Grand Cathedral such as
Chatra Cathedral or army ends and bouvet and a few you know these those beautiful massive
cathedrals they just appeared out of nowhere in a sense because it was what's special about
those great cathedrals is that firstly some of them or the first buildings taller than the
great pyramid and they were different previous to that you had Roman architecture or which was
very thick walls with very not with very narrow doors and very few windows so temples or cathedrals
had been relatively dark and then we had things like Chatra just appear out of nowhere where
they're rivalling the great pyramid in height and they have very narrow walls with massive windows
and and it was like a revolution in in architecture and so we had not only these large buildings
but our hollow with very thin walls and it was a and but this was the period where you could say
that when most people think of mason's so what we had was a series of specialized stone mason's
operating building cathedrals around Europe and our very select group and the every bishop who
had money or king wanted to have a grand cathedral built in his city or his town and so there was a
competition to get this rare select group of of not just stone workers but also people who
worked in metal and glass makers and master weavers and master carpenters all had to come
together to make these grand buildings but this is the type of imagery at least officially that's
where the seven liberal arts comes from and there are certain you'll find it on cathedrals but this
is a like a classic example it there in the center we save a symbol this is called a caduceus
sometimes we call the Kundalini but it's a rod connected with Hermes it's two snakes about the
rod this will be another depiction of a seven liberal arts of their practicing in geometry
and music but again and at the center you'll save a caduceus and this is actually it's a
complicated symbol but the simplest way would be that it's a it's the emblem of mercury or Hermes
and so arithmetic Alan I'm sorry so so Alan the competition between people who were building let's
say cathedrals these sacred structures reminds us of the competition let's say in the 1920s or
1930s with skyscrapers right in other words there's an art and science and everything that a culture
had to offer had to be brought to bear to build its finest structures and that's interesting it's
like everything came together in these structures so I can't wait for you to talk about some of
these numbers in in the sacred text how about you Derek you already know that's that's bringing a
pack to this fight here I mean this is this is gonna get interesting of course Alan if you're
down that'd be great because generally speaking it seems like what we've done already is laid a
general basic foundation saying look this isn't everything from modern to ancient as far back
as we can find archaeological structures that are still standing and measurable we see a theme a
common theme of what looks to be these liberal arts and Alan saying it's possible this stuff goes
further back than when we can you know tell and there's the same numbers same patterns in all these
different sciences if you will and I think it'd be good I think it'd be interesting to get into
the numbers because that's gonna really turn everything on its head so so Alan let's let's get
into some some numbers for our listeners that that many may be familiar with from the Bible now
we could take any sacred text and some of these numbers appear not only in the Bible but in other
sacred texts as well and and just have you talk about them let's identify four numbers we could
talk about 72 144 153 and 273 those are numbers that you deal with extensively in your video series
so if we could do that and I'd like to read a Bible passage where the numbers are found just to
kind of set things up and then have you comment on what things you've discovered concerning that
number would that be to your liking oh yes no problem well if you want to begin with 72 we
could start off with okay I think that'd be a great idea okay let's start off with 72 and I
think Alan you've provided us with a reference from the Bible on that and I have it it's Luke
chapter 10 verses 1 through 3 okay and keep in mind it will mention the number 72 some
manuscripts say 70 others say 72 I think the 72 is more common with the Egyptian manuscripts the
Alexandrian the Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus but it depends on which one you have whether it'll
say 72 but here let's start with Luke chapter 10 verse 1 and it says after this the Lord as Jesus
appointed 72 others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he
himself was about to go and he said to them the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few
therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
go your way behold I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves so there we have it
yeah well what I'd like to propose on and give you examples is that we're using the Bible as a
common theme but I also like to examine how often it appears in apparently unconnected ancient
cultures and still being practiced in varying forms now but I'd like to sort of bring everything
back to a a betting of geometry music arithmetic and astronomy so I'll try I'll always be bringing
it back to especially the quadrillion but before I begin there we mentioned the trivium but I think
that the trivium and the quadrillion are separate but they actually overlay one another and one of
the themes is that the discussion of geometry in weights and measures will often include a very
strong moral element and that we'll find in ancient texts whether it's the Egyptian Book of the Dead
or the Bible that the the way one deals with weights and measures and keeping honest weights and
measures isn't often used as a metaphor of living an honest and true life and having honest dealings
with your neighbors and in that sense it also forms a basis of law so whether it's the Magna
Carta, the Code of Hammurabi or these older codes of law you'll often see that a major
feature in there is in that the king must define what an accurate measure is and then
amongst those laws I'll mention a certain compensation must be of a certain weight of
grain or this much beer or similar themes and so the these ancient texts that weights and
measures is the basis of a of a working society whether it's commerce at the marketplace,
whether it's long-term trade, whether it's paying your taxation and the ability of a government
to arrange itself and to measure land and take taxation and this will also apply well what we
will have is the same numbers that are so important in scriptures across the world will also relate
to weights and measures but we if we begin with sorry to rattle on but these are just some examples
of 72 now it's actually 720 but that's just a order of magnitude so you'll find a certain group
of numbers and it'll always be you know times 10 times 100 times a thousand so just be the
matter of zeros added to this but first let's begin with with a hexagon and so the as you can see
the inside angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees all this will come back but just as an example
because these themes of the hexagon the pentagon the vesica these very essential geometric elements
will relate back to systems of time of of measuring distance and of course myth so a
hexagon which like a beehive these these structures which you'll see repeated that's 720 degrees or
but another way to think about that is that the number of degrees inside a hexagon
is equal to the number of minutes inside a 12 hour clock face so we work we have a 24 hour day
but we have a 12 hour clock face and so 12 hours times 60 minutes is 720 minutes would define day
and night this same number is in modern technology for instance screen resolution you'll see 720p
in three-dimensional platonic solids the tetrahedron is made up of is described by 720 degrees
this is the uh washington i'm sorry i'll just skip past this one so um 72 degrees we'll see
this num pentagon or a pentagram is defined by 72 degrees i'll show you more examples but
it also relates to five a golden number of the divine proportion in trigonometry so we're seeing
in in relatively advanced geometry but here's one of the origin most important ways to consider
72 is that a pentagram or a pentagon is broken up so 360 degrees divided by five gives you 72
so by definition that's one of the numbers connecting pentagrams now that's our standard
room temperature is 72 degrees fahrenheit and ancient units of measures over romans for instance
one sextula was seven 72 grains this is just a random sampling of major cathedrals or major
monuments including the arctic triumph uh and especially places connected to memorials monuments
cathedrals were built around this number of 72 feet is another example of it's used as a standard
unit of of measure in the carbalist and hermetic traditions you'll see there which will extend
back to even the old testament but 72 names of god hold on allen allen hold on one second brother
the we're gonna keep going on 72 but the picture that you had shown with all those buildings i
know that's probably just barely scratched on the surface on on the structures that you've
probably have with this number encoded into them it seems that if whether you call them the freemasons
hermetic structure whatever builders okay it seems that this was in their craft this is
their divine mathematics if you will and um they're crafting it in their art i mean it just
it's i guess you'd say in all these and these aren't all like i'm looking at them right here
and i'd love i wish if you'll listen to this audibly you have to take my word for it or
check out the video once again on youtube um he is showing unbelievable uh pictures of like
multiple things so i didn't want to stop you to you know change the topic because i love this it's
just i don't think our audience sees really what's going on here like the george washington thing
i've seen a picture of that previously are those 72 little circles surrounding um the the circle in
the middle uh yes and you'll also see um now that image there see it that uh there's mercury with
the caduceus so and then you see Neptune with the trident so you'll also see a connection of symbols
there so yeah we have 72 stars around the central point and that's another theme we'll go into that
but uh the the choice of god so wherever it's agricultural gods or but the god of weight
and measure mercury who's also the the god of commerce and said to be a trickster god as well
and uh we're connected to science in general and that's why that's a particularly important
repeated theme and to do with the the history and the meaning of what these symbols are as well
will be worth looking at but uh so what we have is that 72 reflects in in legend tradition and and
but here's an example example now i brought up before that uh okay so this i showed this earlier
where one foot plus one egyptian roll cube but plus one meter equals six foot thus defining
one of the concepts of of an ideal uh design and okay now i think that's worth bringing up
this so now i'm going to have a look at uh Leonardo da Vinci and the famous
the truvian man let me find the okay so that's an image that most people would be
have seen in in some form or another but this is by Leonardo da Vinci and it's called the truvian
man and it's named after the ancient roman architect the truvius who wrote this book
i think it's essential reading in this area it's the 10 books of architecture but what is in the
actual text so i will also be connecting it to units of measure but so just like with this image
here what we have is one foot plus one cubit plus one meter equals six foot but also have
this image here which has uh one meter long pen pendulum now i'll have to bring up the video but
if you hang a piece of string that's one meter long you'll make a very accurate one second pendulum
in that rope all the way will swing back once every second so and it's uh and i'll bring those but
so what's happening is that the cubit the foot and the meter are relating to the relationship of man
but it's also pointing at this uh this pendulum information so one meter and the important thing
about pendulums and we can go into that more but you need to swing it less than 30 30 degree arc
would be a classic the maximum amount of degrees that you want to swing it so 15 degrees from resting
but that amount of arc is equal to one egyptian royal cubit so this is something i've done plenty
of videos to go into in details of this but what we have is a connections between measures making a
harmonious series of measures how they worked well together encoding deeper knowledge so for
instance now we can if we can measure distance and that being the meter we can now measure time
and it's there's a lot lot more to it but this is as one concept of multiple units of measurement
coming together at very powerful powerful and full of knowledge and by that so now i have the truvian
man what i have down here is something called the salamistone this is a found in in Greece and
and it might be a bit hard to make out but i'll be referring back to it i'll be showing it clearer
but what it is is essentially it's a conversion tool where we have different units of measurement
embedded in this particular stone which would allow the different masons from different parts of
Greece to work together at the same even though they're using different feet they're working at
the same scale but this is embedded in the truvian man and so if we overlay that salamistone
it's well for instance the stone goes to his unbilicus or his navel stone being this is a theme
as well we'll look into but it overlays onto the truvian man and
okay now why the salamistone is important is because now i've marked it out we'll see more again
it embeds three different units of measurement which is the common foot the ionic and the doric
foot as well as the samion on the outside but for the moment we just so what we have 500 bc we have
the allegedly modern english foot being used and it's at the same time the dorians or the doric
region was like a different state within Greece and the ionians were again a different state
within Greece and each had their own unit of measurement but what we have on this stone is all
these different units of measurement being displayed together and that they actually come
together to form a bed of knowledge but okay before i leave the truvian man there's certain
ratios built in so that's at a five so so alan excuse me before you go into those ratios built in
this this thing that that you said about the salamistone is fascinating it reminds me and
probably our listeners too of the rosetta stone it's almost as if the salamistone does for the
quadrivium what the rosetta stone did for the truvium since the rosetta stone dealt with languages
you know cuneiform and hieroglyphics and how do we recognize that and it's one thing that enabled
those languages to talk to each other isn't that the same type of thing going on with the salamistone
uh exactly enough and we'll be applying that to the parthenon and i think this will be an
important uh it's an important in structure for many ways but uh for instance the parthenon
will embed these numbers but so the columns of a parthenon are 48 feet high english feet which is
45 doric or 50 ionic feet as we saw on the salamistone when this will be a theme that will go through
all these ancient structures that not only will they incorporate the sacred numbers through ancient
units of measurement they'll incorporate a series of these numbers through multiple units of ancient
measurement so we have uh almost you could use the building itself as a conversion tool
for the physical measures but you can also use a building as a conversion tool
between the different aspects of astronomy music arithmetic
so yeah and it's always everything will cross-pollinate
fertilize complement and and lead to one another and that's like part of a firstly it's
brilliant in its simplicity but the complexity of its depth is really quite amazing and it's uh
wow
okay so we've we've got the golden ratio so if you haven't heard of that or the number phi
in a measurable sense one of the most beautiful things about the golden number is that
well phi we'll just round it off because 1.618 then 033 okay we'll just round it off to 1.618 so
phi plus one equals 2.618 which is equal to phi squared so if we square phi we it is equal to
phi plus one now if we divide one by phi it's equal to phi minus one so phi phi plus one
phi minus one is across dimensions of you know in this beautiful it's the only number in math
that does has this particular property and it's a but it's a very special number in in nature but
whether it's in we'll see uh okay so you have the truvian man he has okay so he will be some
examples of a golden number so whether it's seashells the spirals that appear in sunflowers
tornadoes hurricanes sorry hurricanes we call them cyclones the spirals in galaxies
or the spirals in such in these type of plants these are just some examples of
how the golden number of a golden ratio which most people might recognize by the fibonacci
spiral how this applies in nature because that's what makes it such a beautiful the properties in
their lens itself to nature it's a way to think about the golden number is all the fibonacci is
a rate of expansion or growth because it's just like in math or geometry but it also applies in
nature and this will be so whether it's ancient architecture we'll see the same themes and so
this image by the truvius sorry by divincy but it's based on the
monarch over truvius work now if the viewers can pause and read I suppose I won't you know go into
but what we have this is a chapter from book three of architecture by the truvius and
he talks about the proportions of in temples and basically discusses for instance the human
body is so denom so designed by nature that the face from the chin to the top of the forehead and
the lower scroots of the head so from your chin to your forehead he's saying that that's a certain
proportion of your body but that's I forget the exact name of it but in ancient Hindu temples
Buddhist temples as well that's a unit that they've found in places such as Borodbo Borobudur
in Indonesia and they believe at the statue so that's a man is defining a unit of of measure
that's one of the common themes and so in this particular part of the text chapter one book
three by the truvius it talks about the different proportions of body to height and you know nose
to chin and and saying that they they have a breakdown of of basic measure systems now
the inch would be one most people have heard of it a good way to define the inch is the width of
your farm so which is also a bit like where the term rule of thumb comes from you can use the
width of your farm as a ruler has a basic gauge of an inch and so these systems related to the
proportions of an idealized body which will apply to geometry of the same aspects that will be
repeated for instance artwork such as this but it'll be also repeated in temples across time
across cultures and they'll always come back to a certain set of numbers and that number would be
72 so I think okay
we were okay so I mentioned the number 72 the different aspects of it in weights and
measure systems both modern and new whether it's screen resolution or ancient roman weights
in religious texts the carbola hermetic traditions but we'll okay now we see it as astronomy as well
so measurements of of the of the sun and the moon and there'll be a small group of of units
of measure that I'll be referring to so if I could set those up and just and really begin so
we'll come back to it but so let's start ionic scale is it has in ionic columns or it's also
known as ion in musical mode which is a which we saw in the salamist stone so for instance that's
that's one of the ionic scale is one of the units measured found in that salamist stone we talked
about and it also have the long scale which is a persian foot but some would suggest that it goes
back to the earliest stages of stonehenge and other places but what I'll refer to as the long
foot is a dispersion foot you can see the ratio of conversion but what we have is both in the
ionic and the long foot we have a the diameter of the sun beautifully harmonizing at these numbers
based on 72 so both the sun and the moon create these can be measured using 72 at different units
of measurement so it's not just one unit of measurement it's multiple units of of harmonize
at that point and also you might see that the diameter of a moon is 720 league well that's
like the two 20 000 leagues under the sea one league is three miles so that's just simply
2160 divided by three and that's how you get uh leagues so what you have is sun and moon but we
also have it represented as a very important number in the earth and in the stars and by that
i mean procession which is a 26 000 year roughly cycle but it works out that one degree of procession
is equal to 72 years so to observe this very important astronomical long count this very
long calendar one degree would be about the minimum amount of time you'll be able to observe it
and it just happens to be also the basically the average lifespan in many ways so it's one lifetime
is equal to one degree of procession which is the minimal amount that you could make measurements
of it in one generation so there's a nice harmony there and procession is about a relationship of
the earth to the stars and and to the sun so it's also where not just astronomy in general but
connections between many other aspects but uh now in geometry it's a just a now for instance
whether it's a pentagon one of the important defining angles of a pentagram sorry is 72 degrees
if you if you draw a pentagon the the the hard angle is you know 72 degrees if you add up all the
angles the inside of a hexagon is 720 in um trigonometry you see that 72 degrees is a related
is you know the golden number over two but also what we see there is the vesica and the rhombus
contained there in but uh that is so the vesica we see there 120 degrees that's the same uh from
a hexagon sorry from the vesica hexagons will emerge but again we see this 120 degrees so
this would apply to a hexagon as well but each we have 360 degrees and now we use decimal points
but traditionally each degree was divided up into 60 minutes and then each minute was divided up into
60 seconds similar to to the clock which would make that angle equal to 7200 minutes of the compass
so that's the compass we measure angles you know with a ruler we measure distance and so
now these very common tools that we take for granted whether it's the compass or the ruler
how it applies to navigation but it's also a philosophical aspect but with a ruler we we know
how far we've gone with a compass we know in which direction we are going if we have a clock or a
pendulum we know when we're going to get there and these answer some of the big philosophical
questions in life as well hey alan real quick at that vesica pisces uh is that the net is that rhombus
the net of the story with jesus just kind of wondering does a vesica pisces play a role in
that story with 153 fish and i mean we don't have to get to 153 yet i'm just saying yeah this is well
yes yes and you'll say the the the net or at least the almond shapers it's called a repeated theme
in christian art like the oldest cathedrals as well and some of the earliest christian
christian symbolism was the fish and vesica pisces literally translates to the vessel of the fish
or the bladder of the fish wow wow this is getting good
okay so i'll carry on with 72
yeah okay now um now we'll see it in multiple but here's for instance we see the mayan calender
system and part of my pronunciation but the car aton aton is 7200 days so there's this mayan
and we'll see this calendar system repeated we also have the yugas the ancient you know the ancient
hindu traditions which also have to do cycles of time and the great flood so we have four different
yugas but uh the para yuga is this again a number we'll come back to but the yuga itself has an entry
period then the main body and then you have an exit pit so you have a transition between
each stage and so this to para yuga actually breaks down into 72 000 years then 720 000 years
and then the exit of um 72 000 years so these are long count systems both in in ancient india but
also in amongst the mayan so this is one example and these will be repeated throughout this how our
number systems our special symbolic sacred number sacred structures the number of beads
we have on a on on a japa mala necklace for instance are all part of a system now it also
will apply in different ways so for instance at resting the average human body should have 72
beats per minute which is uh interesting because that is we'll see this number emerging later but
six over five ratio which is a hexagon and a pentagon but we'll talk about this more this
six over five ratio so six over five times 60 seconds is 72 minutes so if some people maybe
are familiar with a bit some of these sacred geometry themes so i might just drop in these
ratios or some you know elements along the way but just in case there is someone who's you know a
little bit more into it but this would also apply to so it's about 72 percent of the body is made of
water so some of these will be coincidences if you go out and measure everything in in in your
neighborhood you're going to find a collection of of numbers because everything can be expressed
by number there's an infinity of things out there you could just go out and measure things at random
but i think that that's also um so things like this i mentioned out of curiosity but
there'll always be we must you know account for the fact that there are so many things happening
and you can count everything eventually some numbers will start matching together so
i think that's an important theme um with with the look into numbers but there are certain
repeated areas and themes whether it's geometry or or astronomy that at the very least make it a
system for investigation but now for instance another sense would be there were 72 books in the
by some count the original or the older catholic bible
now confucius confucius the famous philosopher of china he had 72 disciples
by some now in ancient egypt cyrus was murdered by his brother set and set had 72 accomplices
uh foe for the the ancient egyptian guide of weight's measures knowledge and science
this is an important character his foe he he won every second 72nd day for the moon there's a
connection to between him and the moon so that's um now but also across the east so you have this
sun wukong or a journey to the east journey to the west sorry this very famous piece of
chinese literature might never show monkey magic that old kang fu show with pigsy and
and he had tripitaka but that's uh so monkey could do 72 transformations um now he could also
somersault 108000 lee in a single jump and that's another like 108 we'll see again so sun wukong
will be an example we're coming back to but also in shaolin there are a number of that's between
big and small lujan kwan style shaolin they also have the same numbers it will be repeated whether
it's 36 108 but here we see 72 postures sort of being this number connected to uh luke 10 with
jesus again by some definitions of 72 books in the old test the first uh deceptive agnet sorry
i forget the exact pronunciation of it but the first old testament published in uh the library of
alexandria but there is either called the 70 or the 72 but we see like 72 um just as i was sorry
yesterday for as liver described before now again i think i've shown this in the hermetic
alchemist tradition especially between the 14th and the 16th century this very interesting period
where we have a rose of crucians and and names like this starting to arise um but that again
that is concept 72 with god i've seen those now uh yeah another example would be in the books of
solemn so the star of solemn sometimes depicted it over the five pointed star as we saw earlier
about the angle defining at the heart of a five pointed star is 72 degrees and we have solemn
depending on the book capturing 72 genies or or demons to help him um in his work and there we
have also in like the songs there and i forget the exact uh there's a lot of from the the books of
solemn and these books connected with him emerged what's called in inokian magic which was again
used by alistair crowley to write his books now that'll come off john d but uh a lot of that
part of that uh those type of works by those occultists as at the time were
based on biblical text now okay so while we're we've seen 72 as weights and measures both ancient
systems on tv resolution it's also connected to different music so byzantine equal temperament
is 72 but here's an interesting point in in that room temperature or 72 degrees fahrenheit
is equal to 295.37 kelvin now i'm going to it now but uh 29.53 days is the distance between
the full moon and so this one sort of as it emerges later but now we've just begun with 72 so do i
so you're telling me temperature measurement time weight sound i mean look color pixels on your
screen i mean goodness gracious and now we're about to get 72 virgins once we commit jihad come on now
and uh well a few years ago they found the oldest surviving uh quran and it was the actual term was
72 grapes would be received but also a large um section of the book was about architecture
because we see soon as the islamic period starts they adopt by bizantine roman weights measures
and architecture and we see the same temple measurements repeated and designed so whether
it's christian architecture hindu uh is islamic buddhist and now even modern secular memorials
and monuments will see the same numbers and proportions repeated just we've uh you know
it's just like turning on its side and giving a slight variation but there are certain core
themes now so with 72 as well you have the tetragrammaton which is like again another expression of
you know 72 when it comes to now even that symbol of a vulcan sign that's shin the fire
which will is used in uh masonic alchemy for instance the eagles claw they call it that symbol
and it's yeah it relates to shin or fire which is a 21st letter but so we see 72 but also 216
emerging from the tetragrammaton which again is this constant theme 72 degrees yes okay we've
seen precession okay so that's uh an intro to 72 and i'll bring up the harmonic numbers here so
there are these harmonic numbers are not the only way but i think so this chart of numbers
i'll be referring to as uh as the core of this particular uh system and i'll beginning with
so we'll begin with the concept of music because pyphagorean tuning as they call it so that 432
versus 440 argument rests around this method so this is pyphagorean tuning what most people would
say is the more holistic method uh we have four three two and now okay so i'll bring back up the
the vesica pisces and there we see it's the it's a basic construction it's one circle with
second circle having the its center on the edge of the first so you just draw two circles using
and what we have is basically we create a two to three ratio so this now uh before i go there
because i wanted to talk about the vesica pisces but i just i think it's something worth highlighting
and uh bringing up so uh would it be i might need a a few um moments just to find the right
image so if you and luther could absolutely absolutely luther yeah and you know alan brought
up uh the vulcan peace sign and i happen to be wearing my itic from star trek so things are meshing
so beautifully i'm i'm i'm never gonna look at my vulcan necklace the same after talking with alan
yeah i think it's just amazing something i got a joke for you guys i thought it was funny when
you mentioned the inch being the thumb uh a guy at work please cover your ears if you're not 18 or
older but anyway he took his wife to loze and decided he was going to get some lumber to help
build the shed out back and uh he asked his wife to go over there and grab the nails he needed six
inch nails he's gonna grab the wood head off to the desk and while they were in line i uh i i just
wanted to let you know while they were in line the um the register lady grabs the box and out of
nowhere the guy freaks out on her goes honey i told you to grab the six inch nails and she goes
i don't know you tell me this is six inches and they're three inch nails
anyways i figure i'd make a funny
okay can the kids come back derrick the kids can come back guys i've heard a couple things i wrote
down um he brought up the he brought up the hindu um the the ages and the the time for the hindu
writings and so it was 864 i know that the samaritan king's list has 432 000 years
and that is the ten kings of the samaritan list which is half of the 864 which these numbers all
play together i uh i wrote down a few things that were in the old testament at exodus uh
moses was in the wilderness and uh 70 ancients were with him they received the outpouring of the
holy spirit two of them mildad and middad were back at the camp then you had uh 72 descendants of
noah and uh then you also had the there's i mean i'm just thinking of a few things off the cusp
there's 72 buddhas um on the temple in indonesia the statues of buddha and so it's like oh wow i mean
there's a lot going on here but anyway hey derrick i'm looking at the text itself are you guys
and in that passage in luke it talks about the harvest three times right he says he says the
harvest is plentiful and then he talks about the lord of the harvest sending out labors into his
harvest so harvest is obviously a very important word and that phrase his harvest if you look at
the gematria of it the numerical value of the letters i talk a lot about gematria but it happens
to be 72 times 23 so it's even embedded in that passage in luke in some interesting ways
