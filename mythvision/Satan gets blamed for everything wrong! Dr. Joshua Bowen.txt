Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Josh Dennis Popek one of my patrons has a question and he says I really enjoyed
your discussion with Dr. Josh smart funny guy as you well know Satan gets used a lot
in the Christian community and none more so than with the highly promoted and commercialized
Protestant evangelicals for the cause of most everything counter to Christian message and
the troubles in the world however much of what is attributed to the head evil dude does
not appear to be at all properly represented in the biblical narrative as portrayed so
liberally by Christians if appropriate would you ask Dr. Josh his thoughts about the subject
additionally I would like to hear Dr. Price's thoughts as well yeah I mean foosball is the
devil right as Bobby Boucher's mama said sorry yeah so I'm thinking of actually things
that have happened recently in our in our community things that like the spiritual realm the unseen
realm is a very real thing to a lot of people so it's that's not so simple I suppose you
know it's more nuanced than like the devil made me do it or something but you know obviously
every proctor and gamble anything made by them is you know satanic but no so the idea of how
this idea of Satan developed is an interesting question of course you had Elaine Peggles on
that yes she's written a book on this developing this so she know much more about it obviously
than I do but when I think about people saying this happened because of the devil this happened
because of Satan I really do think this goes back to it as its roots in this apocalyptic genre
right in the way that apocalypticism developed and again this is this is definitely a strength of
John Collins so you know far more than with me so I'll give you my two cents but you know the idea
behind apocalyptic literature is that you have this duality good and evil and they're warring
against one another so when you look at something like Daniel what Daniel 12 where you know the
archangel so I was you know was fighting against the prince of Persia so I was delayed but when
the prince of Persia goes the prince of Greece will come this is very much in line with this ancient
Near Eastern idea of a city or you know a governing entity having its own divine being over it and
you see this very early in the third millennium for example in the steely of the vultures where
Ningirsu the deity of Lagash is depicted holding his battle net and inside of it are the enemies of
Lagash and this is depicted in such a way that on the opposite side of the steely because he's
winning in the spiritual realm they're winning in the earthly realm and this is how this works
this whole battle this whole you know border conflict between the cities of Uma and Lagash
in Mesopotamia in this period is cast as you know battle between the two deities so Ningirsu is
over Lagash and the god Shara is over Uma and so there because they're fighting you know it plays
itself out in the reality so I think this becomes this explanation for why bad things happen to good
people why bad things happen to the righteous of course the natural outworking of that I think
it's sort of its development is that anything then that's bad or anyone or anyone for that matter
becomes either the work of the devil or someone who is under the influence of the devil and so
becomes this sort of all-pervasive thing and Seth Andrews actually was recently on the Atheist
Network group should go check that video it was really good love Seth Andrews love Oz bitty Buddha
was on there as well and they had a great interview with him about the satanic panic and that's what
this is all about right so you you know you see what was in the 80s and 90s you get this you know
if you play that song backwards you you know hear Satan playing how was it playing the the
musicians much like we would play a musical instrument there you go and you got Ouija boards
and you know so demonic influence all over the place again but I think it hearkens back to if
you've got bad things they can't be attributed to God who is good they have to be coming from
Satan or his minions in this more dualistic spiritual unseen realm so real quick while
we're in this I love the painted picture because that's what Elaine Piggles said this same thing
and that's why I said anyone because anything bad that happens or anyone that typically it's usually
painted to the bad guy and you know if you look at like Job if you look at the the numbering of
Israel with David that was at first Chronicles or yeah maybe Samuel I can't remember one of the two
books they parallel each other one makes Yahweh look bad and the other one makes Satan look bad
and anyway just this idea is you see you know Satan keeps playing a certain role and I don't
think these authors had any intent or even idea that well you know later down the road they're
gonna see that that was the bad guy the whole time like no he's working for God actually as part of
this committee so to speak as Yahweh or as a John Collins painted it he said you know God's on a
throne and he has all these guys around him and one of them comes and he's like hey this guy right
here and he said have you tested him and divine counsel that's right divine counsel simple is
that like any kingdom where you're testing your nobles like any other ancient Near Eastern
you know divine counsel but down the road you can see when dualism pops into the scene and it's
really a thing how he easily gets tagged or this character that named the title becomes an entity
and how it's easy to put that go oh you know what duh that it was him it was hidden in our
scriptures the whole time or something just like Christians will do with Jesus hiding in these
prophecies I'm sure they did the same thing yeah right wouldn't you think that makes sense yeah oh
yeah I mean this is how later interpretation of ancient text works and so I think this is why
theological questions they're interesting but not really to me quite often because you know I'm my
focus my the limited time that I have to do things I I tend to spend that on what's actually going
on at the time of the writings and the later redactions and editorial processes so so then
what is the book of Daniel about is a question that I'm interested in not what did second estrus
do with you know the prophecy in in the book of Daniel so but it is fascinating to watch and again
I mean you see it gosh you see it absolutely everywhere today to the point that you know in
these more charismatic circles you know something good starts to happen God is moving God is moving
here and then like a phone ring Satan is trying to take over this meeting and we need to fight him
you know or or uh you know sort of Christian rat particularly from like the 90s and the 2000s you
know like you know throwing out the wicked beating down the devil you know it's a it's a battle it's
a war and of course I mean you see this right in the biblical text I hate to say this but like I'm not
a big fan of the war on drugs at all right as someone who was in addiction because the war on
drugs you would think as people who think oh this solves the problem or this is going to work
no what it's done is it's made a lot of people who are suffering with mental health issues or other
suffers suffering uh with different things uh they are the ones suffering from the war on drugs and
so I guess what I'm saying is is this war against the devil is not a war against really Satan or
even demons if they exist you're not doing crap to them what you're doing is you're actually creating
an us first them mentality is exactly what Elaine Pagels and you were saying is the people who aren't
on our side biblically speaking who don't believe like us whether you're strict theologically or
you're a little bit more liberal but you still say yeah they they're definitely on the enemy side
that us first them mentality the people who suffer aren't the spirits I would say because
they don't exist but even then it's it's the people yeah it's when you cast I mean it's otherness
right if you disagree you cast them with the enemy you cast them with that which is bad and uh yeah
where and I'm thinking about something recently that's happened but where this becomes so dangerous
and insidious I think is it in cases where
you have somebody that says look if you have enough faith
you can pray and you'll move a mountain this person will be healed and then when they're not healed
well you know either satan worked his way in uh you you didn't have enough faith and so satan
was allowed to come in and take control did you did you give place to the devil in other words
it's victim blaming quite often I think in a very real sense because the person that you're
giving this what I consider to be false hope to you're then blaming them either directly or indirectly
for the failure of god to act and of course you're doing this it doesn't seem so insidious
because you're doing it you're actually attributing the fault to the devil but you've allowed the
devil in either by not having enough faith or by thinking impure thoughts or whatever so uh yeah I
think it's ultimately I think it's pretty dangerous I agree with you there's a video on youtube I saw
what they had like hundreds of faith hill preacher type people who actually died um of an illness
and they're supposedly are healing everyone but they die of illness well listen I I I I want you
at home right now if you are sick maybe you I see someone right now someone right now who has a cold
put your hand up to the screen ha ha ba ba la la ba ba you you you have been healed and if you
mean jeez odd Jesus if you want the full blessing meldice check in become a patron become a patron
of then you can have this same healing yeah it has to be a ten dollar patron though that's what I see
hot seven not a five not a five or three ten times because the bible says ten times those who
folly toward the I'm just kidding I feel like a very bad person now but no no no but that's exactly
what you see happening um or you know my friend here died and so I need you to tie the you know
no too early no um anyway no but seriously the funny part is is I think you and me have in common
is wanting to know what it meant yeah and this is the discussion I mentioned last time I was here
that I had with um del martin on the phone one night and del kept like saying what it meant
you'll never know don't even try like it's cool to maybe give a guess but he's like it's like you
does it matter what mosar originally meant when he wrote the text wrote his music
does it really matter what he originally meant it's how people interpret it now that really
matters and I'm thinking to myself I think if we could do a service of telling people what it
originally meant and really say sorry you're out of context here I understand how you would
take it that way and it's interesting to see people throughout history for example how they
interpret revelation I mean even Irenaeus is already reinterpreting the book in the 180s
to say oh this is applying to us and then Athanasius does it but he reinterprets even
further to mean something else in the third fourth century so I it's interesting to hear how they do
that yeah but I feel like if we can get to some sources here and we can say this is what it meant
here yes it it tears down um some harmful ideologies oh my gosh yeah there's some good
stuff sure I mean I hear Mozart and I could think about modern things and how I want to
but Mozart's not causing people to go commit suicide or bomb themselves or whatever their
yeah I mean I think the difference is the the authority that the people today
place upon what they understand the original writers to be saying and what that text actually
mean so if if people were listening to Mozart today and saying well when I hear you know an a flat
I'm very musically inclined when I hear an a flat it's telling me to kill people
because that's what Mozart is telling me and I think Mozart is speaking on God's behalf
so every time I hear that a flat that's what he's telling me a flat go kill somebody well then
you know we could say that's crazy don't do that dummy
but it might be more effective for that person if we could say look let's go back and see what
Mozart actually meant what he's actually saying look at what he says here and like he doesn't mean
a flat kill people it doesn't work or more of a better analogy a flat when I hear that um as an
example that tells me they're going to hell so now you got to tell other people they're going to burn
yeah right forever that's right by an all-loving god yeah whoa um that's what it looks like to me
and then if you do go to the actual source and let's just say there is a different way of maybe
understanding this maybe it's annihilation maybe it's a doesn't mean you have to believe it I mean a
flat annihilation I think that's what it is we figured it out come on somebody hanama shamada
we're all home thank you
so
