we are myth vision ladies and gentlemen I'm sick and tired of Coles taking
advantage of people over and over mind manipulation they're controlling their
every action there's a guilt they have to separate from family all their money
goes into the pockets of these people and so one of the biggest cults in
America that really got my attention is Scientology and today I've Karen de la
Carri√®re joining me and she was an ex Scientologist but not just anyone we're
talking she went all the way to the top she knows the inside she was there
with Elron Hubbard she knows the character of David Miss Gavage she
knows the dirt on these people and today we're gonna hear some of that I
don't even know what we're getting into so Karen please tell us something of a
crazy story you told me that you have okay we'll do Derek dearest it's not
one of the biggest cults I have to correct you that it's a dying cult with
20 25,000 members so I don't want to give it that much go right now it's a more
sinister cult it's a more evil cult in fact what we're gonna cover is some
Scientology wickedness evil evil mafia gangster type evil so not to not to
combat you with your good words I just give it the glory of being big I
appreciate it and I'm learning please tell me people leaving droves and they're
thinning out and they're diminishing they are not big anyway the first the
first evil story I wanted to tell you is of the valiant mayor of clearwater he
served in the military 28 years you had Mexican heritage his name was mayor
Cazars Gabriel Cazars and Scientology bought the Fort Harrison the title was
United Churches of Florida that kind of bought it from southern land development
these were the thing is when mayor Cazars looked up these entities they did
not exist they did not register you know when you're an entity you register
with the government and these so the first red flag mayor Cazars got was that
was no United Churches of Florida and the Fort Harrison in the 70s was the heart
and soul of clearwater the bars there the restaurants there people like the
Rolling Stones came and lunch by the pool I can send pictures if you want it
was it was the meeting place so and it was in those days a Jack tar hotel Jack
tar had was a franchise of different hotels so some group coming in calling
themselves United Churches of Order who were buying it from there was some
southern land develop on none of this it was fraud is absolute fraud so mayor
he's the mayor of clearwater you know he from day one the entry was done
surreptitiously and with fraud this got this started they entered clearwater on
the wrong track they since they needed to be in hiding and Scientology's name was
not really mud as it is in this day it couldn't just be up front and say it's
Scientology oh wow so the mayor and Scientology were not the best of friends
and the first posting comments I'm going to post is the different programs one
after another after another to destroy me a Christmas for being an opponent to
so they found out he was an opponent they found out how quick did they find
out and did he know that they found out yeah he spoke up he spoke up against he
spoke up against the fraud of United Churches and Southern land but he spoke
right up wow dishonesty one of the programs they did was to try and get some
marriage certificate in Mexico where you can buy a birth certificate even just
get some nice cash and then they were going to publish it that he was a
look he's already married in Mexico this was all a fake certificate they were they
did program after program after program
oh my gosh the level that these people go yes you see you see Derek this is not
just any old cult this is a cult that will go anywhere yeah destroy their enemy
they named mea Kazaris as an enemy now one thing many people don't know about the cult
is that they have travel agency privileges this means they can log on as a travel agent
and look at the manifestancy who's flying who's on an airplane flying where I mean
their intelligence division have total other access to flight information do you know any other
church that no you know of any others that pose pose as a travel agent
no no and I can't even begin yeah they found out where Kazaris was going to Washington DC
for a mayor's conference or some kind of conference and he was supposed to meet a reporter in the lobby
and he the reporter showed up and didn't really get into it and left meanwhile
a kind of pretty nice girl called Sharon Thomas showed up and she seemed to have a shine on the
man he was kind of coming under him and you know when a man is out in some hotel hundreds of miles
from home it gets tempting yeah and she said why don't we why don't we eat why don't we have some
fun and she then lured him and they were driving in the car
and it looked like she slammed on the brakes and said oh my god we hit someone
and she said I'm not going to stop and she drove on now the mayor is in a hit-and-run
incident he thinks he believes Sharon drives on and then I hope I'm getting the facts completely
right but she he calls his office and says look I'm still thinking about it I think we
may have killed someone you may have you were in the car with me and you agreed to just hit me right
so now the mayor is in a black mailable position oh and they recorded this conversation
absolutely so this guy doesn't even know did they hit someone are we not sure like
it was all drilled and build the culture Scientology that reporter that was supposed to
make him come to the right place where Sharon Thomas she worked for the Guardian Office the girl
who was coming on to him who was pretending maybe they'll write all set up the whole apology
set it up they drilled it and all of this was only found out because the FBI raided the church
and towed away 250 boxes and all their internal communication was discovered
there was no there was no injured man but the mayor was made to believe that he participated
in running over someone let me ask you this that recording of the mayor like kind of confessing
being involved with this girl in this trip in this hit-and-run did the church like are we do we
know if the church said listen we have this information on you this is what we need you to do
or did they just go public with it to embarrass me to get him out of office
like how did that go about do you know
I don't know all the nuances but what I just told you is the actual programs
devising all this that the see when the FBI confiscated all these internal memos
many activists demanded freedom of there there's a law where you could get any government document
it's called freedom of information at FOIA and slowly slowly these memos got tripled out
that was a very good question you asked yeah because I don't know it and maybe you don't maybe
it's out there but the point you're making is well put they know for a fact that Scientology
is manipulating and they actually are doing criminal acts like this in this is not like a
I want to get your cousin to like me so I'm going to lie and say I'm dating this other girl or
these are high governmental political figures in power yes and you got to imagine how
high are they going with this and what do we not know have they learned their lesson and they're
still doing stuff like this but we just don't know about it because they they stopped having
paper copies now they absolutely because Hubbard in these issues for the Guardians
office reincarnation is OSA offices special affairs and our offices special affairs do
everything under the sun to take out enemies you see this is what is almost obscene about the cult
they will do anything and everything to take out an enemy they will they will they will
manufacture evidence they will cross the line and there's something I don't know what better word
to use than obscene it's so diabolical and all of this is done to protect the good name
and survival of psychology this is amazing their entire el run Hubbard philosophy is
kamikaze 101 they are literally destroying themselves themselves by doing this very
point that is necessary if you're going to follow el run hubbard destroy your enemies at all costs
really what you're doing is self-destructing because this dying cult like you said at the
beginning is only shooting itself in the foot instead of reforming it and changing it into
something newer something better with better policies they're still going to keep on going
and they're just gonna they're gonna explode yep well this incident was done to gaslighting
do you understand the time yeah it's psychological warfare it's mentally dangling with his mind
to make him so so just so
constantly in a fear of what will be revealed next you can't think clearly you can't act
you can only make correct decisions when you're clearheaded and you know what's going on this kind
of psychological warfare has been written by hubbard and if it's written by hubbard it's
biblical absolutely you do what the boss said to do oh man this thing's doomed from the start
wow wow i mean the fact i can't imagine what we don't know i mean this is why i have you on the
channel because you're not only aware of this we've got other stuff we're going to touch on in
upcoming videos um you talk about irs your husband knows about this stuff like the tax evasion
everything this thing how it slips through the cracks this long is beyond me but we're exposing
that and letting other people know is there any final words on this particular subject let me let
me finish this off with her even okay when i came out of Scientology it was very loud big announcement
i got 500 email in one night from all around the world Karen you remember me you know what the no
Scientology decided to do a hit on me and they are not a mistake called the FBI
on you on me on me i got all the documents i can and said she's trafficking in children for under age
sex no what they did these are made videos not so yeah that's what they that was the acquisition
now when a government agency gets something to do with children they have to follow through an
investigation right children children but can you imagine the lunacy i was a cluster i've worked
for them non-stop i was in i had fly i was had all the accolades you can imagine and overnight
i became a traffic cop of underage sex this was the accusation yeah so so i got all these phone calls
and the person that they said i was trafficking for was my CPA
and he called me and he called me and he said you know the FBI visited me and they said there was
an anonymous voicemail anonymous to the FBI office that i was trafficking
and for trafficking children for my CPA for underage sex and he said the FBI were a little cynical
they sat down and they said does Karen de la Carriere have any enemies
at least they asked that question oh my god she just came out of the culture of Scientology
two weeks ago very publicly and the FBI literally had body language they heard this and they kind of
but my CPA bill he he's they said case closed that was the end of it they never even called me
they closed the case they are so educated in the maliciousness and yeah setting up an enemy
they know the game so well that they didn't proceed they never even came to interview me
once bill told them Karen came out publicly against the church of Scientology they knew
the anonymous phone call that i was trafficking in underage children for sexual intercourse
that was the end of that because the culture Scientology is known by government agencies
to do despicable hideous hateful things even though they claim they're a religion religious cloaking
just to attack and enough that's the phenomenon oh my gosh ladies and gentlemen this is crazy
honestly and we've got more coming up make sure you guys check out you know the description for
