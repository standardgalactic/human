we are myth vision welcome back to myth vision podcast we're taking a deep look at the church
of Scientology today Karen de la Carriere is going to expose more of its dirt like you haven't
heard anywhere else and this is not an exaggeration some of the stuff that you told me in this last
episode blows my mind and you said Derrick I have three stories to tell you and I'm like
this is one oh my gosh I'm all here all ears for you Karen oh by the way for those of you
don't know she was a top top on the ship with Elvron Hubbard I mean we're talking
she knows it all when it comes to Scientology she knows it all Karen please educate us on these
these crazy stories hello everybody and welcome welcome back uh this story is
sort of pregnant and for all women that watch it I don't know what you're gonna feel
uh when a horrific incident happens within the walls of the sea orc it is absolutely
forbidden to report to law enforcement in fact it's considered a suppressive act
they will name you an anti-social personality for going to report something to law enforcement
and and for those who you don't know anti-social personality is technically
how would you put that well anti-social means you're criminal you're a criminal a criminal
suppressive person in Scientology means they deem you to be criminal okay criminal just want
our audience to follow not that normal human being you are criminal and and speaking out about
Scientology makes you criminal the in their definition you see they is a propaganda by
changing the definition of the word so am I a felon in this already okay awesome so this story
is about a beautiful young girl called know me was a sea old member and just a lovely girl she
looked like a little disney princess she was just a sweet lovable girl who was the wife
of the commanding officer of income income is an abbreviation of the division of the church
that handled all the computers computers was a separate division and the guy who was the head
commanding officer's name was Chuck prenup one day out of the blue blue sky
Chuck prenup lost it and he savagely went for throat to strangle her in public
in in public meaning within the walls of the sea organizers right and he was incredibly violent
they say one madman has the strength of 10 10 normal men so something happens with the adrenaline
or whatever when seal members launched forward to get him off knowing was terrifying it was
this was seeing a homicide in real time they couldn't even pull him off
and he continued to strangle her there is a point where consciousness is lost
in in such a i i'm not in medicine i don't know the call some artery could call it whatever
anyway he was strangling him strangling him strangling her his wife of a few years
eventually they pulled him off do you think they reported this to LAPD this was attempted
homicide no question no if so but this what he had the intention to kill her
um so it it's electrifying within within it's electrifying because they promote how they're
going to get you higher and once you belong to their technology and their procedures and their
routines you become better better better you become more ethical more moral more enlightened
and here's a seal member of some years lunging forward to kill
this is the kind of thing they they have to hide because they're selling and taking big bucks
yeah the reverse of this you would never make you a killer they'd make you so ethical and so
conscientious you wouldn't dream of harming a fellow fellow man right how did you find this
information out if you don't mind me asking it spread like wildfire it was i was right there in
big blue while this was happening i was in the structure but i didn't i witnessed it but i was
right there okay so quickly these two are booted off you the first thing Scientology does in a horrible
act is get them out of jurisdiction so they can't be questioned and Tucker sent to Florida
he is a very high tech the reason he was commanding officer of income the computer
he's very very good with computers and they get him some high tech job in Florida get it out of
Los Angeles out of California this part of the story nobody knows i'm excited they were worried
that he would talk that he would yes that he would cause waves who knows what he was telling them
he was oh this is a looting you don't grab the neck of your wife to fight you i mean it doesn't
get you off the hook because you're insane you can be guilty and insane both right right
we're guilty of that and yours i don't know what he said but the cult got hold of
and said to you you have to go back and live with him
you have to you have to go back and be with him
he needs to come down
and she went back because the cult ordered it and slept in his bed
and had sexual intercourse because the cult ordered it a man who tried to almost kill her
wow so i mean that's in and of itself that is abuse obviously to force someone and she
you know there's no no i'm not doing that you can't say that you couldn't do it in your position
just to tell them no like that wasn't an option the pressure is on well this is what i want to
discuss with you for a moment or two the control the authoritarian absolute control
the cult has on you can take you to a point where you
will obey them to go back to the environment of someone who tried to kill you and get into bed
and obey cult orders
Derek you talk to all kinds of people from all kinds of religions
is there any religion is there any cult is there any group that can have that kind of control
that you would go back to your own killer and be a good girl
yeah i don't not that would see that publicly and then still do that no that is the that is
the worst and you know the beginning of this the first video we did when i said the biggest
cult i didn't mean in numbers though i could see what i'm glad you corrected it because
technically yes um you're right it's a dying cult for this very reason but what i meant is
this is the worst the biggest worst example of a cult that i know of uh in in the united states
for certain reasons now i might come across some other the children of god the sex cults that have
the most deviant sexual acts and i just don't know it yet i'm sure we'll get there but this is
in terms of having influence and potential political power and whatnot this is one of those like
how is this still around i can't believe that so by any chance skipping a tad bit into her
and him what happened to him and her did we hear anything else from them or was everyone
completely silent and cut them off from the rest of the world or they both drifted off
deciding better to not
revisit is done with all of sense she complied she was a good girl she did what the cult asked of her
but the horror of being given an order to return to her murderer or would we murder her
was not lost on her yeah was done with all did she get out oh yeah well she was kicked out once
once this happened both of them were absolutely removed this was too this was too dirty this was
was too painful this was you see the cult crave Derek they crave good PR they want good public
relations yeah want to be thought of as this safe island of the safe uh sanctuary of goodness
me crave that image
that they are the saviors of planet earth this is the image they crave it's completely lunatic so
anyway no one is gone Chuck is gone only all of us who are around at that time know very well
how the cult did absolutely nothing to report this to the church of science knowledge to the
to LAPD absolutely nothing to report it to LAPD or any law enforcement although Chuck
attempted homicide to what attempted homicide yeah and they just rushed it under the rug yeah
huh no that's only one story of numerous acts of rape molestation that the cult never reported
to LAPD all tucked away under wraps everybody's violence the cult the cult of Scientology
is full of things and they're the ones who need to be purged you know so this is unbelievable
I love you taking a steep in it just makes me imagine how many types of situations similar
to this that you aren't even aware of and that's since you've been out like can you imagine I
can't imagine behind the doors what has happened in so many scenarios so there's a lot more stories
to come from you is there anything else you'd like to say final final touch-ups on this
um
the one thing Scientology wants you to believe is that goodness but when you lift up the curtains
and look and see what happened behind the scenes
there are gossips horrific stories and I want to reveal that darker side to you Derek went up this
so many
ladies and gentlemen Karen de la Carriere thank you so much like the video tell me down in the
comment section what you think about this this is crazy I seriously think it goes right into the
vein of some of the woman's rights issues we see in Islam and other things like it's just
it may not be the same exact dilemma but it is horrible what you're seeing here so please
help support us in any way you can down in the description Karen see you next time
