we are myth vision ladies and gentlemen today I have Karen de la Carri√®re
joining me again about Scientology and welcome back Derek you look as handsome
as ever thank you so everybody hello and you as beautiful as ever as usual but I
want to ask you something you know Tom Cruise and John Travolta they believe in
Scientology there I mean there's some really big names out there who are
convinced of this this movement and maybe we should ask the question to have
you tackle this question what do Scientologists actually believe you know
Scientology is a ladder of different levels going higher higher higher and the
lower levels the intro levels are quite effective and quite educational and can
give people you're not getting into any sci-fi or volcanoes exploding and attached
first you just simple good stuff how to communicate better how to solve
problems and look at the problems you are coursing kind of thing they are life
improvement courses these lower levels so they take common sense we all no
matter what you believe can agree on and see as pragmatic or practical things we
all would go you know yeah that's that makes sense I think I'll do that no
matter what you believe they tap into that at first absolutely but what is
very deceptive is when people walk on the door in the door and sign up do these
lower level they have no idea what's ahead they don't have a clue that
Scientology's six upper levels are exorcism levels they don't have a clue
and Scientology doesn't say see you take the Roman Catholic Church the evangelicals
you walk in the church the Bible is right there take it or leave it there's
brutality in the Bible but they don't hide the Bible as oh it's confidential and
you can only read it Scientology is we have secrets yeah only get there if you
follow the structure and you pay the money the money level by level by the
time you're done with the lower levels your fifty thousand dollars into it can
I say one thing before we go to into some of this I remember listening to Tom
Cruz's testimony and he always talks about how he failed in life and
Scientology saved the day and the very things he was talking about that helped
him with Scientology was many of those very practical basic common every day
to day things that we can do better at so Scientology does a really good job
out the gate really capitalizing on the basics that people in life need structure
and it gives you the sense of I have purpose I have this I feel like I'm
and they give you that out the gate without giving you the whole package
here nibble on this appetizer but they're gonna sneak the little bit of
stuff in there and the next thing you know you're starting to find yourself
indoctrinated believing in things you wouldn't have beforehand but he was
convinced good yeah that was good Derek it's it's a bait and switch because you
don't know what lies ahead and you don't automatically get onto the these
confidential upper levels it's by invitation and you have to get ethics
clearance and RTC clearance RTC is a very high manager and they look up your
ethics they want to know if your risk they want to know if you're going to go
blab about all this on the internet which hundreds of people now do but in but
even with all of this exposed all over the web they still behave like it's the
holy grail the most confidential of confidential so what happens is you have
to get sex jokes and interrogatories to find out if you're OT eligible
and people are drawn in what are these secrets I don't know yes and they pay and
they have all these interrogatories and they confess their masturbations
they confess they were attracted to another woman not their wife
that goes on and on and then they go see the ethics officer and they do amends penances for
their crimes it goes it's a long runway and finally the day arrives and they get a white
envelope and it has gold embossed markings and the envelope they open it and it says you are
invited to the OT levels and they pick a deep breath as they are overjoyed they have no idea
what these OT levels are but they did the runway and paid mega bucks to be on the ramp
just to get just to arrive there's no automatic look you've been asked $50,000 you're great
here you are go in the room and read this no there's this runway
and then Dennis are you able Derek are you able to just please read when they're finally
given the OT three pack they are stunning yeah so I want to show this to people this is the
paper that you sent me but that's the opening page one right this is the this is what you sent me
and I just wanted people to see like who what is this by the way is this written by somebody
that's Hubbard's right that's Hubbard's writing okay so this is the man with the plan but let me
go ahead well you know what I'm gonna keep it up and I'm gonna read you what it says at least some
of it the head of the galactic federation 76 planets around larger stars visible from here
founded 95 million years ago very space opera solved over population 250 billion or so per
planet 178 billion on average by mass implanting he caused people to be brought to to geic earth
and put an H bomb on the principal volcanoes incident two and then the pacific area ones were
taken in boxes to hawaii and the atlantic area ones to las palmos and they're packaged his name
was xinu he used renegades various misleading data by means of circuits etc was placed in the
implants went through with his crime loyal officers to the people captured him after six years of
battle and put him in an electronic mountain trap where he still is they are gone or they are gone
the place confederation has since been a desert the length and brutality of it all was such that
this confederation never recovered the implant is calculated to kill by pneumonia etc anyone who
attempts to solve it this liability has been dispensed with by my tech development one can
free will through the implant and die unless it is approached as precisely outlined the free will
auto running on and on last too long deny sleep etc and one dies so be careful to do only incidents
one and two as given and not plow around and fell to complete one thing at a time
in december 1967 i knew someone had to take the plunge i did and emerged very knocked very knocked
out but alive probably the only one ever to do so in 75 million years i have all the data now
but only that given here is needful one's body is a massive individual satan stuck to oneself or
to the body one has to clean them off by running incident two and incident one it is a long job
requiring care patience and good auditing you are running beings they respond like a pre-clear
some large some small fayton's believed they were one this is the primary error good luck
what the what did i just read that is so crazy tell me people are made up putting fear they are
told if you are exposed to this if you get some renegade copy of this and you read it
you're going to die of pneumonia what's going on i'm just
and hundreds of people have read this has all been my god it's all over the internet and has
been for years nobody ever came forward and said my god i read all this and i got pneumonia and died
but hover did frighten a lot of people be careful now once you read this you die of pneumonia if you
don't do exactly what Scientology says you're to do you and you do the procedure let's let's keep it
let's keep it as honest and real you used to believe this you used to read this and be terrified
and obey this didn't you i did wow and the way i did it was exactly for the procedure you look
for a spurt around you and the meter reads and then you send him to tell you which volcano he got
blown up in and he'll name the volcano and you telepathically then send him to relive it
and relive the implant the implant is
some pictures and thoughts put into your brain it's in inducted into you
and you and once he's run incident two implant you run him to incident one and i did this for years
i didn't go crazy but i know many people that did i mean what people run crazy
i can relate because i was pretty superstitious i believed in some weird i burned cd's music that
i thought was evil and of the devil and like you know stuff like that so i was thinking there were
spirits in them uh and all sorts of stuff but but yeah no this i just i'm trying to relate and
just point out that it's i do there are many people who do that it's just not the same kind of
religion but this reading this is really weird because as you read it in that in that paragraph
where it's almost two paragraphs it's like it's one large paragraph in that he is telling you the
very fear he wants you to he wants to induce in you you can die right which is kind of like
in honor to anyone who's doing it and they are practicing it because in their mind
the fact that they didn't die is evidence to them that they're doing it right so there it's like this
weird self-fulfilling prophecy of being chosen and being special because i didn't die of pneumonia
just like hubbard said i know i'm on the right path and it's almost a bs to yourself you know what
i mean brilliant did you ever tell yourself that brilliant eric that's such a good analysis
you know i left behind many friends and anyone who hears me giving away their core secrets and
discussing their thinking in their head that karen de la carria she's going to burn lifetime
after for the next millions of years she's going to be in black just she's going to be punished for
this her karma is going to be worse and worse and she's going to freewheel in the hell of what
she's done by giving out these core secrets well let me tell you my life every year gets better
and better and better since i left the cult every year i become more amen i become more healthy i
become more willing to speak so you know what i'm not you don't you are doing the right thing karen
you're telling the deep dark secrets and you're being transparent about the tom fullery that
you know you were caught up in i was caught up in it like i get it and what you're doing is is
masterfully explaining and expressing the reality of it because a lot of people who've come out of
this i've heard of them and i've seen them they're still practicing Scientologist who've left the
whole thing and you're seeing it for what it is you're admitting where wisdom and practicality is
like hey they're they're taking common sense that that anyone you know any wisdom teachings will tell
you they're using that as a front they get you sucked in and next thing you know you're you're
talking about pneumonia and zeno and volcanoes and and planets and stuff and like you and you're so
already you're already so sucked in you'll believe anything but it is an interesting indoctrination
that he points out the whole self-fulfillment um but the fear you know there he's touching on things
it makes me think this man was a very clever clever man he understood the psyche of man
enough to know how to manipulate people and right there in this there's multiple things
going on not only manipulation it sounds there's a lot of um your imagination is imagining things
an atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb you know you're imagining amazing ideas in this mass population
you can't even imagine like your imagination's going so fiction plays a significant role
but he paints it in a way as if it's real to you and then at the end of the day here you have this guy
who's not only trying to convince you of this but you're told you're special and you're the only
people who know about it that feels good it felt good to me to know certain things that
when I was in my version of Christianity and I looked at other people part of me was like
I want you to know this but they wouldn't listen and at the same time when they wouldn't listen I
would just think I was chosen I was special you know I was special and they weren't and that's
is what it is that's what I used to think we get invited to OT levels you feel very special
you're the elite you're the cream of the crop you're a blue blood in Scientology yeah
well I think that I think that we almost could do a part two on the belief spritz because I
haven't even gotten into OT four five six and seven we've spent a whole thing OT three is called
a wall of fire even within Scientology this is the wall of fire but then it gets even more
oh please let me do a show with you on the next it gets even more um well I'll let you read
I want to read this Wikipedia page if I don't mind if you don't mind so we have wall of fire right
we just dealt with the insanity of the wall of fire and many people saw this and probably went
what the hell is this but then you have OT four which is the drug rundown OT five which is new
era dianetics for OT's OT six Hubbard solo new era dianetics for OT's solo knots
auditing course and then OT seven is Hubbard solo new era dianetics for OT's auditing and then
this is where it really gets you ready OT eight the truth revealed I mean come on who doesn't want
who doesn't want to know the truth revealed right just fork up a half a million dollars and we can
tell you're you're into a million dollars now you oh really stole you gave up your house you sold
your you're living in a van it's all gone to Scientology for these secrets these secrets
and you know what blows me away as we're wrapping this up because this is so this gets me excited
just because not I feel bad for the people that were in it but it excites me to discover how
ridiculous this is you know I love it it's so much fun but you know this is what really gets me
it's like it's your face you're you're having a blast and you know it this is hilarious
it's so
laughing at how donkey I was but you your comments are just so cool this was so cool you know a human
being will believe you look yeah I saw pictures of the volcanoes in my mind but let let me do a test
on you if I say Derek please don't think of an elephant I just saw an elephant what you
did in your head yeah do you not get an elephant I immediately as soon as you said the word
you got it if the elephant is offering his trunk to get a banana from you don't think of that don't
think of the elephant offering his trunk at you don't you get it yeah I do you can be very
suggestible and you can get what you're told happen anyway I did years of this I I but I'm out
of it all well they packaged it in a way that it was a clever packaging I'm sure what we're doing
is we're cutting through the fluff and letting you see it for it what it is without putting all of the
what I like to call drinking the Kool-Aid glasses on because if you were wearing her
glasses at the time you would totally understand where she's coming from and why it's not ridiculous
but because we're not indoctrinated and we're watching this and we're looking at it
you can now you can look at it and laugh and we like you're talking to someone who knows
exactly what it felt like to be OT3 OT4 OT8 she knows the truth revealed okay like she
experienced it it wasn't just haha with Derek being a skeptic mocking at this she breathed it
she lived it so I just want people to kind of try to put your you know the Scientologist
chew on but at the same time realize this is baloney and what they're doing is harming people's
lives but I just I make you laugh I know it's funny but but at the end of the day I can only
imagine I want to give one analogy before I let you go is this early Christianity they they sold
this package okay that not only will you live forever because they gave you promise of life
after death okay not only will you get to live forever but you can only worship the one God
and you are an elect a chosen one if you choose this hard path of persecution and I'm talking about
when I say early Christianity I'm not talking about the Roman Catholic Church I'm not talking
about church history I'm not talking about the Eastern Orthodox or the Greek Orthodox or the
Episcopalian or the you name it I'm talking about the early Jewish movement that we find in the
early pages of the Bible in the New Testament and they had a special cult that was saying
you can have life after death now this isn't as ridiculous as you know Xenu volcanoes and science
fiction stuff at the end of the day but if you're packaged in a in a space age and technologies
advancing in the 21st century you can see why people would fall into the trap of what
Elrond Hubbard's saying but the point is don't you want to be special and unique and be a chosen one
and and be there when when God comes back to change everything you want to be the one don't you
and that pulls people in in fact pagans who never cared about the God of Israel the Jewish
God they didn't like him many pagans found this whole cult very interesting and were drawn to it
because you could go and worship Osiris Serapis Apollon you know the different deities you could
go to Apollo whatever you could worship all these gods and join all these different movements that
promised you different things but when Christianity came on the scene they said no one God but don't
worry this God will defeat all of the other gods and you're special that's the whole that's the whole
teaching oh that's very that was brilliantly said even I know something there very good Derek yeah
it connects to it it connects to it the point is is you won't you're not an idiot like no people who
are in this are not dumb this but there is a manipulation of all of us wanting to be special
and Scientology really capitalized on that yeah at the same time not admitting that they don't
believe in any God there is no God we've discussed this there is no God in Scientology yeah you are
God I am God we are God all the BT's are God everyone is God so there's no there's no higher
deity to worship or acknowledge or appreciate none none but again that's the mating switch it's never
you're never told that you never know that oh wow just to wrap up you usually please go ahead
usually you say is there anything you want to say before yeah yeah no I'm interested in hearing
any words that you like well there is a very very famous Hollywood director and producer called Paul
Haggis and he did he won two Academy Awards one was for Million Dollar Baby story of a female boxer
Million Dollar Baby won Best Picture and another movie he did called Crash Best Picture so he
it's very rare that a director you've got to be in there in the league of Steve Steven
what's the name of the director that did Jaws Steve Jaws
anyway Steve Spielberg okay okay I'm like I'm trying to think
you gotta be in that league to win more than one Academy Award and to get two pictures that you
produced and directed Best Picture Paul Haggis was a Scientologist and the reason I'm telling you
about him is he hit OT3 and he tells the story I'll send you a clip he reads this and the first
thing he looks up and he tells his stuff is this a joke and he thinks you know what they're testing
me they're motivating me to see how loyal I am if I'll fall for this this this can't be real this is
totally science fiction and they said no no no this is serious this is the wall of fire
and he thought somebody's pulling my leg they think I'm going to sit down and believe this
horseshit anyway long story short Paul Haggis walked right out on that day never to do anymore
so I thought she looked at OT3 and thought I am not going to swallow this unlike sheep like me
that did swallow Paul Haggis had his integrity and he and Leah Remini have done shows since and
they've laughed and cried together and stuff like that so there's an example and and I want to tell
you many people did look at all this and go no no yeah I'm not going to play ball with this I'm
not going to ever attack Scientology I'm not going to speak out don't worry about me I'm not going to
go on the internet I'm not going to make YouTube videos but Sayonara I'm done I don't want any
any more of this and Scientology will never let you know how many people looked at this
and walked out the door you see they're crazy about metrics and statistics but they'll never
give you the statistics so right not everybody got bamboozled by a long shot some people did the
Paul Haggis route they looked at it and they said what look I got gain running communication drills
and all that low level good stuff you had put this and I'm supposed to run my attached spirits on
the volcanoes and H1 no and they walk out the door Derek there's been a percentage that did
walk out the door see good for them you know it begs the question if there was ever a time someone
asked Elron Hubbard to explain how he came how he received this information uh how did he actually
come to attain this information which I know and you know he made this up but the point is
has he ever gone on record trying to uh say I did space travel or I somehow was transplanted back
500 billion years ago whatever my point is has he ever explained why or is that too is that outside
of the realm of anything that's been actually explained there was a guy who just passed Tony
Ortega did a whole blog today on him called Jim Dinchelci Jim was a sweetheart and he lived with
Hubbard when Hubbard went into hiding in New York he left the Apollo because there were there was
the French government had indicted him for fraud so he was a wanted criminal in France that's a
whole story of how they bamboozled French people to give up garbage of money anyway Hubbard got
indicted and Hubbard fled the Apollo and went to live in New York in Queens New York and Jim
and another guy called Paul Preston lived with Hubbard for nine months and Jim and I became
good friends I hosted him when he lived and I talked to Jim a lot about the very question you asked
I said how did he was it just um Jim told me that Hubbard did a kind of channeling if you
know what that is yeah the eyes would roll up and flutter fully and he would get
communication from extraterrestrial higher means or whatever and he would furiously write
and he would be just gone and then two hours later he would shake himself back down to earth he was
so Jim lived with Hubbard for those nine months and Jim I'm not saying all of OT3 was channeled and
it was like a download an internet download from right right right right so what do you make about
I mean there's mystery after who knows yeah he's someone who lived with him by all record there's
no question and Jim said Hubbard did channeling what is channeling channeling is when
I I didn't say I believed in channeling but the definition of channeling is you let some
out of spirits right kind of download the data to you from outer space or from wherever they are
that's crazy well look I I definitely want to wrap it up here let's continue OT4 through 8th
and continue on people want to know these secrets before spending a million dollars on this
yes Eric this was fun thank you so much you made me just who took laughter thank you
if you want to channel the spirit of myth vision you can with us we are myth vision
