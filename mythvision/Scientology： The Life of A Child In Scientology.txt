we are myth vision ladies and gentlemen we are on another show
about Scientology and I'm introducing our guest Karen de la Carri√®re welcome
back to myth vision hello Derek I'm really glad that you're back we're gonna
be talking about children and if I may let me start us out with something in
Scientology doctrine children are regarded as being adults in small bodies
according to Elron Hubbard their bodies house ancient and immortal
feitens or spirits who are capable of carrying out the same responsibilities
as any adult because their spirits are regarded as ageless their status as
children is irrelevant Scientologist working as staff members believe that
their most important purpose is saving the world and everything else is
secondary Vicki Aznaran I hope I'm saying that as Neuron a former church official
explains Scientology and I'm quoting comes first and everything else is off
purpose parents who want to spend time with their children are looked down on
it's not officially acceptable and there you have it so we're gonna be talking
about children and just to give people an image in their minds you have a little
baby that is considered an adult in their eyes I mean how ridiculous can it
get so Karen talk to me about this this is a fascinating thing because I don't
know any other cult that that actually views children as adults there are some
cults that come close to viewing puke like right there pre-pubescent females as
potentially at the age of sexual consent or they consider like even an
Islamic tradition there might be something of this effect or whatever
but tell me what is really going on with children and the cult of Scientology
Derek I think you would agree with me that you can truly evaluate a cult or a church
or a religion by the way they treat the young ones do you agree with that statement I think
that that's a practical wise statement yeah well when they treat youngsters with domination bullying
overwhelm and force and coercion then you really got to look at is this
is this really a church is it really a religion in Scientology it starts off with
babyhood now because Scientology wants money above all cash cash cash they will
corral expectant parents and make them pay for counseling for the baby
counseling for Scientology counseling and Scientology counseling on babies is something
like this the counselor auditor will be in the room with the baby and tell the baby
you make that body lie on that bed
the baby's lying on the bed that is so weird the theory is instead of the baby lying in the
bed automatically you're commanding it to actually make that I can just imagine how you're
but Scientology has all kinds of statuses oh god
platonious meritorious humanitarian the lot a lot they got all these titles that we send you a
couple of pictures and if you give five million if you get three million you get this trophy
some people turned in the trophy to pawn shops and couldn't even get a hundred dollars for this
grotesque so what we do is the parents are over the moon to be having a new baby
and they make the parents donate huge sums to have the baby have a status so the baby before
it's born will be patron meritorious of Scientology and that cost a million dollars
no college education save no no the cult has already scanned the would-be parents
of money on a child that isn't even been born yet so that's how early though the money
octopus tentacles go other do you know other religions that force out money because a baby's
I've never heard yeah no not that I'm aware of I'm not aware of any cults that do that in
particular I mean let's give them an image so they have something in their mind they are doing
an auditing session right here with this little kid and I mean the questions that they ask these
children I literally was my skin crawled and I thought I would feel uncomfortable as a 33-year-old
man like answering some of these questions and can you imagine this innocent little kid who's
probably going to answer them without any you know there's no privacy there's like there's
so many things and I don't want to rabbit trail there I mean I just I just literally want to
make the point I've never heard of any cult that does these things on that level there may be some
control involved in some cults that or even in some religions that aren't quite cult like maybe
they are in some senses where children are asked to constantly pray and ask for forgiveness of
their sins and they like are like really monastery type of level control situation but
they're not from what I could tell there's no money to be had of purifying fatins from your
three-year-old you know this is ridiculous you know other than the exorcism that Scientology does
level after level after level it's a one-trick pony of the question what are your crimes what have
you done what have you done that's evil and although Howard said man is basically good that's just
fluff and frock because 90 percent of Scientology other than the exorcism is
trying to make you confess to the bad but in that sense it's similar to didn't you tell me you came
from a discipline where you were evil and could save you was that Pentecostal it was in the vein
of it I mean Protestantism is in that vein as well you're born you're born absolutely wicked
without help and God actually should destroy you like they teach that's why when the doctrine of
hell eternal punishment comes up they don't bat an eye you deserve it you're head in there anyway
you're lucky if God saves you from it that's the kind of mindset that they have so at least their
forthright in this horrible ideology of suggesting you're born an absolute you know vile thing
that at least a forthright they're not lying and then tricking you into coming in and say
you're a great person come on in no their whole thing up front is you're horrible and you need
us and we have a solution for you that's that's the thing at least Scientology kind of is mixing
and manipulating in a weird way you know yeah and children are indoctrinated so we're looking at
what does Scientology do with children children are indoctrinated to snitch on their parents
at a very young age and through these questions you could see half the parents get caught from those
those questions are so deep I don't think I've ever asked my kids these questions there's a
hundred of them you sent me could you could you read out a sample just the audience this is the
kind of thing a child sitting on the cans in Scientology with a Scientology counselor is forced
to answer up ladies and gentlemen let me read you some of these questions that they're asking
children ages six through twelve as a security check I would it be surprised if they were five
and they did it but anyway listen to this right first question what has somebody told you
not to tell that's already like most likely your mom or dad have something don't tell anybody this
okay here's the deal you're already crossing that boundary number that was only number one
we only have 99 more to go number two have you ever decided you did not like some member of
your family hmm sounds like blackmail is getting ready to be set up three have you ever taken
something belonging to somebody else and never given it back have you ever pretended to be sick
or ill have you ever made yourself sick or ill or hurt yourself to make somebody sorry have you
ever wanted something very much but never told anybody about it have you ever gotten yourself
dirty on purpose like you know like what is going on with these questions already have you ever
refused to eat just to worry someone I mean and the list goes on and on and on and you're asking
this to little children now I get it if you were like an actual psychologist and there was a problem
like out the gate you went in this child seems to have mental health issues they're having constant
panic attacks or whatever I don't know and you wanted to like psyche value evaluate them
but they're doing this to all the kids seems and in this kind of setting right like something
like this or oh yes or something like that yeah yeah oh man over now so they grow up thinking
in terms of secrets and it's all bad what I'm thinking if I don't confess and the whole thing
is stressing it should have fun and play and enjoy childhood in Scientology they are put to work
so the ludicrous thing is primarily Scientology wants abortions if you are stuck not public
they can't interfere with public but if your stuff you kill that child that's been done decade after
decade but if the child is born if the people refuse and they escape and they come back in
Scientology that child is used for blood for cash first of all donate to audit the baby second
second of all give a status a gold meritorious platinum platinorious glorious
astronomics and you get a plaque and you give give give money so that the child has a status
is is this word label huh are these are these those or is this getting off into a rabbit
showing that they graduated and did a Scientology service and they give a success story of how
great and fabulous it was okay a better certificate got it authenticizes they've done I think we're
going to get into that a little further yeah yeah now after scamming the parents for money for status
they get more money from the parent to put the child through purification random
sweating in the sauna five hours a day with short breaks this this look at them now the
purification rundown was originally devised because in the 70s there was a drug culture
LSD and STP and DMT and you know not that there isn't plenty of opioids and other drugs but
Howard brought out this procedure by the way I was there made a testing for the first pure
of ever and that's a story I gotta tell you on the ship this was on the Apollo with Howard
and I I'll tell you that story now so purification rundown on seven year olds
their entire drug list is cough mixture and baby aspirin that's because you have to list out all
the drugs you've ever taken but adults have taken huge amounts of drugs for surgeries and anesthesia
but a little eight year old has never had any drug history worth a dime
how can baby Advil make you sweat in the sauna for five hours it's a money rocket but Derek you
have to understand parents that love their children feel that being doing the right thing for their
children because they've been sold a bill of goods and they believe they believe this is
goodness for the child my son Alexander Jench who died at 27 years old because of the cults
toxic policy of disconnection he did three purification rundowns before he was 14 he did
they they even that cost you while he was stuck at the time CEO okay they make the
co-organisters go through so I didn't pay however I will tell you that at 12 13 years old I had left
I just had to leave I was gone he was still in the co-organization Alexander and at 12 years old
and he had no schooling you know the Fort Harrison the big building where Lisa McPherson
died in a cabana Fort Harrison this huge multi-story building in playwater yeah Alexander spent his
two years of his life 12 years old and 13 swabbing cleaning toilets swabbing floors vacuuming
and cleaning out dirty estrus that was his life and he didn't tell me
because they had been warned never tell outside people what happens inside the CEO I didn't
know that he was a toilet cleaner I knew he wasn't going to school but but you are also so caught up
in this for so long yeah there was there's no seeing outside I feel like I want to show them
one of the girls who was told to recruit and wasn't successful to show they work these kids
and and this is the image you sent me here she's so it says according to Ladyberg this is a German
girl named Katrin or Caitrin she was RPF'd after a flubbed recruit tour so she she messed up she
didn't get she didn't get the recruits she was supposed she didn't bring the money in you know and
well you're going to pay for that so let's put her to work so there she is on her hands and
knees scrubbing the floor Scientology doles out diabolical punishments now here's the thing
when I fell into disgrace and I was removed from my high post I had that detail that now my son
was doing I had to clean the banisters I had to swap the toilets and the thought that my son
is now cleaning the same spaces that I did before I fled that really got in my head
because I knew the the disgrace of it the shame of it and the hour after hour of cleaning
and swabbing floors so Scientology treats children like you read at the opening statement
the ancient spirits they've lived millions of years they're not going to be treated in
pamphlet like youngsters stop that get on with it work slave work that is the attitude towards
youngsters in the sea or children are treated as work units and their entire life is to contribute
to the forward movement of Scientology well look cleaning the toilets and swabbing the
floors and all that at the Fort Harrison what it's still forward Scientology because they don't
have to pay outside janitors they make their staff do the slave labor right therefore Scientology
saves the money no mechanical cleaning goes on I interviewed a girl who had to take out as best
stars with that she and another youngster in the teams had to clean out as best stars
hour after hour with no husband suits that even wasn't partial that was just a work detail
she came on she came on my youtube channel and talked to me about it yeah that's dangerous
and you know I know I used to work with the guy who who was at my old construction job
whereas a manager his father was a pastor and he had a little house church like type of thing
and he had a community of adopted children that actually he had adopted well he put them to work
they worked every day like it literally was you have a farm you have to keep it up all of these
kids worked and these are all underage children that are all maintaining these things and doing
all these things that are adopted so he would adopt these kids not only do you get a check from
the government for doing this but he also was not paying them anything they had a place to live
he made sure they were fed that was it now that might have worked back in the day you know back
in the good old days they talk about where everything was on the farm and survival was
based on crop and you name it well this is like 2020 this is 2019 and all of these children
are not being paid a dime and someone had told on him so the law got involved and they actually
got him for child labor law issues and long story short he got in trouble and had to pay this large
fine and and come to find out if he was going to work them he had to pay you know these children
for their time or he couldn't work certain kids up till a certain age but the ones that were
above that age they could work and get paid and they needed to be paid because he wasn't paying
them either it was just a bunch of headache and it just goes to show you my point is there's not a
systematic methodology in the religion that you know they are doing that this was just one guy
taking advantage of it to try and like better him and his little church group Scientology at
large this massive organization is practicing this as almost the methodology yeah you know
that's what's crazy you know
there was such an absolute uproar at children being separated from parents at the border the
immigrants that were coming through the southern border we hear about it endlessly in
Los Angeles because it's the southern border just down the road right San Diego on the border
and children were separated from their parents and the country went into uproar in fact
they now want to give 450,000 because they lost the kids were separated to immigrants coming in
in Scientology it's standard practice to be totally separated from your kid
and that goes on every day every hour every moment
Jenna Miscavige the niece of David Miscavige wrote a book called Beyond Belief
and she would see her parents maybe once a year while she did hard manual labor
oh those are good pictures I got to send you they had to carry rocks up a hill little eight
year olds nine year olds heavy rocks they had to kill that to build some foundation when
they were put to work like contractors adult contractors and she wrote this book and the
book exploded she was on CNN and she NBC she was because she was David Miscavige's niece
right family David Miscavige's older brother's kid Jenna and Jenna did this entire book
of the slave labor and the treatment of children while confiscating the parents
to work morning noon and night for the forward motion of Scientology
where there's something obscene about the greed of Scientology they want your money
they want your life they want your labor they want your kids for slave labor
give me some comments what what other so-called impersonating themselves as a church carries on
like this I don't know any contemporary ones that I can imagine doing that yeah that's it's
over the top and definitely shocked that it's even in America anymore I mean look at look at
Russia at least they had the the wisdom to say yeah you're not pulling that crap off over here
I mean seriously they won't even allow them there but I just I just figure just making that comment
it's it's really interesting how they are obsessed over all this stuff and at the end of the day you
wonder do they even believe in what they're saying or they just that greedy and the guys at the top
are just pulling strings it's hard to know it's hard to know but they could they could very well
be multiple things going on at the same time and in my mind I'm standing back here looking at this
thing going what do you want you want their fatins too I mean what else can you get out of these
humans you know it's like give us everything even the evil fatins we'll take it all that's how crazy
it sounds it is it is see Scientology masquerades as a religion but it's run like a business it's
purely statistics and metrics we even children have to keep statistics you know how many how
many floors swept how many toilets clean everyone has graphs and it's run like amazon
it's Scientology is run on metrics everybody has a statistic if your statistic isn't at a good range
punishments wow if your statistics are in a higher range you might get a day off once a month once
in three so so but the point we're making in this is just to show the IRS granted them religious
tax exemption but the IRS are a bunch of CPAs and lawyers they're not theologians there's not one
theologian in the IRS and the IRS doesn't have the authority to say what is a religion and what
isn't a religion they they can tell you what qualifies for religious tax exemption if you meet
this criteria and this criteria in this there's all these things too so I don't believe because
there's no theologian in the IRS oh boy some of your religious colors they didn't ask what do you
do with the children what do you do with like the IRS these are dark secret places that were
exposed the IRS didn't have a clue and nobody thought to even ask because what they do with children
is pretty has been for a long time pretty damn shameful now because of the internet
uproar and backlash they now won't take for now the reason for abortions is children are
trouble they cause us bad PR they cause us problems we don't want children so they don't
have children now well they do recruit I had a mother sobbing on the phone to me her 14 year
old was being signed up for the C organization and she said what can I do she called me what can I do
and I thought wow they're taking in 14 year olds they had announced to the world well we're not
we're not dealing with children this you know we've gotten rid of all the children I want to tell you
one thing Derek as we wind we've and like we've given up a few things I would just want to tell
you one thing a tremendous amount of children brought up in the cult left and I got the parents
are still in the sea oak but they're gone they just had a backlash of blowback they didn't want to
hear they don't want to participate they don't want to hear as children and there was a whole
crowds of them one time living in downtown Los Angeles in a loft they were called the lost boys
they were gone from the cult but their parents wouldn't the parents didn't care if they lived on
the streets and a couple of them got into heroin and street drugs and their parents
totally ignoring all that working for the statistics and metrics of the cult of Scientology
that is the way parents are brainwashed to the point that my children do drugs on the streets of
LA after all they left the sea organization they must have over some crimes I'm going to work for
the cult that's the attitude of parents that abandon their kids to the streets of Los Angeles
ladies and gentlemen if you don't believe us that's fine I don't blame you you can be critical
the thing is this is the common trope that I hear when you watch Leah Remini when you
watch these other shows you listen to other accounts all of this stuff adds up on the same
level of what she's saying today Karen thank you so much this was extremely enlightening
I hope more people stay away from it keep their kids away from it and keep your money because
you work hard for that and you deserve it they don't deserve it that's for sure so any final words
before we let you go if you've watched all the way right to the end of this good on you thank you
for watching sooner or later because of the savage rampant non-stop octopus tentacles of the cult
people are telling me they're getting on their facebook they're getting ads Scientology promote
promote you may have a friend that is about to be sucked in please use the knowledge and wisdom
you got on this show and if they youngsters being recruited can they please watch what Derek and I
discussed before you give up your childhood to see organization thank you thank you ladies and
gentlemen we are mithvision
