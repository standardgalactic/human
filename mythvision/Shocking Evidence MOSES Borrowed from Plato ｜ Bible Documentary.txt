Did Plato copy from Moses or the Bible authors?
Or did the Bible use Plato and its creation of the stories we find in it?
And does it even really matter which one came first and influenced the other?
Personally, it wouldn't bother me if Plato used Moses or the Bible.
But in this video I hope to give good evidence that it actually may be the case that the
Bible used Plato and other Greek authors rather than what was just always accepted, and that
as Plato used Moses.
Why does this even matter?
Personally, I want to be as factual as possible on historical questions, but let me try to
help us understand the reason this really mattered to ancient peoples.
In the rise of Jewish and Christian ideas in the Greek and Roman world, there was a competition
of ideas, especially philosophical and historical pedigree.
To put it simply, if the Jews, meaning Moses, borrowed from the Greeks for his ideas about
the one God and the creation of the world, assuming Moses wrote these texts as the ancients
like Josephus did, then the Jews and by default the Christians would have necessarily been
indebted to the pagans for their ideas.
This would complicate things, to find out that the Greek ideas are not only older, being
further into antiquity, which was a big deal, but this would also imply that Moses or the
Bible authors would have had to borrow their ideas from the Greeks.
Being blunt, the Bible borrowed from Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Canaanite, and other stories, which
predate them in the development of their stories.
But the issue on the table at this time wasn't whether the Jews and their holy books are
indebted to earlier cultures.
In this case, the Greeks and Jews were far from the first and were both indebted to earlier
stories or mythic traditions.
Jewish and Roman historian Flavius Josephus literally wrote against Apion, which is a
polemical work written as a defense of Judaism, as a classical religion and philosophy against
criticism by Apion, stressing its antiquity against what he perceived as more recent
traditions of the Greeks.
Josephus writes in Against Apion, for we have not an innumerable multitude of books among
us, disagreeing from and contradicting one another, as the Greeks have, but only 21 books,
which contain the records of all the pastimes, which are justly believed to be divine, and
of them five belong to Moses, which contain his laws and the traditions of the origin
of mankind till his death.
Point being, the Jewish tradition, carrying more antiquity, was an extremely important
argument against the critics of both Judaism and Christianity.
In modern scholarship, we question whether people like Adam, Abraham, Moses, Joshua,
David, Solomon, etc. even existed.
But back in Josephus' time, it was accepted that these figures were historical and existed
in the times portrayed in their literary works.
Suppose you were them, and were convinced that either Plato borrowed from Moses or whether
Moses borrowed from Plato.
All you would need to do is argue that Moses lived 1200-1300 BCE, while they knew Plato
was a 4th century Greek philosopher.
The texts that discuss Moses have the appearance of ancient by placing the guy way way back
in time.
So the default argument is that Plato had to copy Moses, being 900-1000 years after
Moses existed.
So many philosophical schools in the common era after Jesus were looking to the Greek
philosophers as a noble life to imitate and tried reforming schools of philosophical thoughts
by Plato or Pythagoras.
They even had several debates or arguments trying to show Pythagoras or Plato as the
ultimate model that was owed for bringing the greatest philosophical thought, meaning
who came first with their great ideas, Pythagoras or Plato.
Often going back to the earliest one philosopher and cutting out the others helped that school's
narrative in being the best teaching.
Older is better in their heads.
Several of these biographers would describe how Pythagoras or Plato were educated by others
such as barbarians, in harvesting, Egyptians, geometry and asceticism, Phoenicians, the
science of numbers and mathematics, Magi, the rites of the gods and Chaldeans, the art
of contemplating the sky.
This is exactly what 2nd century BCE Jewish apologist and intellectual Aristotle tried
captivating on against the Greek intellectuals.
He claimed the Greeks admit in their own writings of learning their ideas from the people of
the East and barbarians, which Aristobulus suggested were the Hebrews.
The Greeks thought to systematize these ideas into a philosophical way.
That was to make it superior.
But were these people really the Hebrews or Jews?
Greeks had no shame sourcing that they learned their ideas from other cultures and gave credit
and sourced where they learned their ideas, which is important as we progress through this
video.
No shame in saying who your sources were, then why not mention Moses or the Jews?
The earliest source of Moses, a known written history, is from a non-Jewish Greek source
by Hecateus of Appdera, who knew Moses and the founder of the Hebrew nation.
In this video, I'm going to propose that the Bible authors copied Plato and other Greek
works.
People's scholarship has accepted the idea that Moses didn't write the first five books,
if he wrote anything found in those books, let alone whether he even existed.
In this video, I will highlight several reasons why I think in several places the Bible most
likely crafted their narratives using the Greek sources and why I think the Greek was older
and used to craft the biblical narratives.
The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr is known for defending Christianity
to the Platonist of his day.
In his first apology, he claims that Plato's understanding of the creation of the world
depends on Moses, and that you may learn that it was from our teachers we mean the accounts
given through the prophets that Plato borrowed his statement that God, having altered matter
which was shapeless, made the world hear the very words spoken through Moses, who as
above shown was the first prophet and of greater antiquity than the Greek writers.
Both Plato and they who agree with him and we ourselves have learned, and you also can
be convinced that by the word of God, the whole world was made out of the substance spoken
of before by Moses.
At least one well respected contemporary scholar of the Hebrew scriptures, Margaret Barker,
argues that Plato knew of the writing of Moses or the Bible, though she acknowledges her
view as in the minority.
I do find Professor Barker to sound like an apologist for Christianity in her writings,
even though she is very learned.
She at least is taking serious though, the claim that Plato and Moses, or better yet
the Bible, know each other.
This is important as we proceed.
The early apologist, both Jewish and Christian, maintained that Plato learned from Moses,
that he was Moses speaking Attic Greek.
The most notable of these was Eusebius of Caesarea, who in his work, the preparation
of the gospel argued the case in great detail, enlisted all those who had held such views
before him.
Eusebius and the other apologist were probably correct.
My reconstruction suggests that the priest of the first temple knew an invisible, heavenly
world on which the tabernacle, or temple, had been modeled.
That they spoke of forms, the form of a man and the form of a throne.
That they described the heavens as an embroidered curtain.
That they knew the distinction between time outside the veil and eternity within it.
They knew that time was the moving image of eternity.
They knew of angels, the sons of God be gotten on day one, as Job suggests.
They concerned themselves with the mathematics of the creation, the weights and the measures.
They believed that the creation was bonded together by a great oath or covenant.
They believed that the stars were divine beings, angels, and they described a creator whose
work was completed not by motion, but by Sabbath rest.
What I have reconstructed as the secret tradition of the world beyond the temple veil would,
in any other context, be identified as Plato's Timaeus, written in the middle of the fourth
century BCE.
The passages in Timaeus are the creation is good, the invisible world, the forms, time
and eternity, angels created first, but the story of their origin is not known, the mathematics
of creation, the bond of creation, angels as stars, resting as the culmination of creation.
Elsewhere, Margaret Barker notes that scholars have admitted to being puzzled about the origin
of Plato's account of creation.
Plato introduced for the first time in Greek philosophy the scheme of creation by a divine
creator according to which the world is like a work of art designed with a purpose.
She also points out that the pre-Christian Jewish writers made the same claim as Justin.
Erastabulous, for example, a Jewish scholar in Egypt in the mid-second century BCE said
that Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato, had followed Moses, when they were contemplating the arrangement
of the universe so accurately made and indissolubly combined by God.
Even also to understanding the foundational project of early Christian philosophers is
the Hellenistic, neo-Pythagorean philosopher Numenius of Appamea, with his work on the
good only fragments extant.
For what is Plato, than Moses adesizing?
This is disputed by scholars, but if Numenius wrote this, it really goes to show his interest
in making Pythagoras shine and Plato subordinate to both Moses and Pythagoras.
Porphyry was a third century CE Neoplatonic philosopher born entire, who leveled criticisms
at Christianity about Moses.
His critique was twofold.
First he lamented that Christians had applied convoluted and improbable allegorical exegesis
to what were essentially poor works of literature that should have been abandoned in the first
place.
Second, he exposed the synonymity of the mosaic text by leveling text's critical arguments,
maintaining that they were actually composed by Ezra.
His attacks were mainly focused against the Christians' misappropriation of Moses.
Philo of Alexandria, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher from the first century, held from the vibrant
city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt.
In his biography of Moses, Philo grappled with the intellectual tradition that emphasizes
Moses' antiquity.
The narrative of Moses' upbringing in the pharaonic household as detailed in Exodus presented
a conundrum for Philo.
He subscribed to the belief that as a member of the Egyptian royal family, Moses would
have been privy to the finest education.
Echoing the journey of Pythagoras, Moses was envisioned as being tutored by the imminent
scholars of Egypt and its neighboring regions, including the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and even
the Greeks.
This education mirrored the Greek concept of Paideia, which pertains to the cultivation
of the ideal citizen of the ancient Greek state.
Yet, in Philo's portrayal, Moses transcended these teachings.
Despite merely absorbing knowledge, Moses' intellectual growth mirrored the platonic
concept of anemnesis, a soul's innate ability to recollect knowledge.
In Philo's narrative, the fragmented wisdom of ancient civilizations found its synthesis
in Moses.
Through this lens, Philo artfully positioned Moses as a figure whose innate virtue surpassed
the teachings of the Greeks and barbarians.
This virtue was merely a precursor to the profound wisdom he would later receive directly
from God.
The striking parallels between the teachings of Plato and the biblical narratives of Moses
have long been a subject of intrigue.
While some ancient voices ardently argue that Plato drew inspiration from Moses, this assumption
warrants scrutiny.
Not only is the historicity of Moses a matter of debate, but the timeline of his existence
also remains ambiguous.
The earliest historical mention of Moses doesn't appear into the cusp of the 4th and 3rd centuries
BCE, post-dating Plato's established works.
Recognizing the profound similarities between Plato's philosophy and biblical narratives
is pivotal.
While some ancient scholars might have been quick to assert that Plato borrowed from Moses,
it's essential to approach this claim with a critical lens.
If this exploration serves to highlight the undeniable parallels between the Bible and
Plato and prompts a reevaluation of the direction of influence, then my video has achieved its
purpose.
It would indeed be a revelation if further research substantiates the hypothesis that
the Bible authors might have been influenced by Plato.
As my series unravels, you will see parallels that are strikingly resembling Homer, Herodotus,
and other Greek writings.
The video gets to spotlight today, a blast from the past, Russell Gamirkin.
For many centuries, scholars believe that the philosophical musings of Plato bore traces
of Moses' teachings.
It's akin to recognizing an old melody in a contemporary song.
Historians and thinkers from diverse backgrounds, be they Jewish, Christian, Greek, or Roman,
largely concurred on this point.
Even at the chronicles of Moses were much older than Plato's dialogues, it seemed logical
to assume that Plato might have been influenced by these ancient scriptures.
This viewpoint dominated academic circles for a considerable period.
And while it's less prevalent today, a handful of scholars still advocate for this connection.
You will even find Christian apologists argue this online as well.
Let's back up to around 150 BC.
An inter-Aerostabulous.
An intellectual luminary of his time.
This erudite Jewish philosopher well versed in both Greek literature and biblical texts
proposed a groundbreaking theory.
Contrary to the popular belief that the Greek translation of Moses' works appeared around
270 BCE, Aristobulus argued that the Greeks had been engrossed in the Jewish Torah much
earlier.
He even insinuated that iconic figures in Greek literature might have drawn inspiration
Supporting his theory, Aristobulus highlighted parallels between the writings of Moses and
seminal works of Greek literature.
He drew comparisons with Homer's grand epics, the lyrical compositions of Orpheus, the legal
frameworks crafted by the Athenian statesmen Solon, and the philosophical discourses of
thinkers like Pythagoras and Plato.
For Aristobulus, the implication was clear.
By the time Homer began his literary journey, Moses' teachings were already circulating
in Greek, influencing the intellectual landscape of the Mediterranean.
If one detected biblical undertones in the works of these Greek luminaries, Aristobulus
playfully insinuated that they were likely drawing from the rich tapestry of the Bible.
And Aristobulus, despite his intellectual prowess, seemed to overlook a crucial perspective.
He never entertained the possibility that the authors of the Bible might have been influenced
by the likes of Homer, Solon, or Plato.
It's an intriguing counter-narrative that challenges the prevailing thought of his time.
Consider the historical conundrum surrounding Homer.
For the legendary poet to be influenced by the writings of Moses, these scriptures would
have needed a Greek rendition, well before the advent of the Greek alphabet.
It's analogous to imagining someone streaming a series on Netflix before the dawn of digital
technology.
And here's an added layer of complexity.
Homer, often regarded as the literary titan of ancient Greece, was traditionally believed
to be illiterate.
The notion that he might have meticulously studied translated biblical manuscripts seems
rather far-fetched, and we have no evidence of such things to begin with.
Now picture yourself delving into the writings of Herodotus, the ancient world's premier
chronicler.
Often held as the pioneer of historical writings, father of history, Herodotus crafted an extensive
nine-volume account around 450 BCE.
This magnum opus wasn't merely a diary.
It was an encyclopedic exploration of the diverse civilizations dotting the Mediterranean
landscape, from geographical descriptions to cultural origins, from unique traditions
to diplomatic relations with the Greeks.
Herodotus covered it all, yet, in his vast compendium, there's a glaring omission.
That omission is the Jews.
It's akin to discussing the panorama of contemporary pop music without acknowledging the influence
of iconic artists like Justin Bieber, or Beyonce.
Herodotus, known for his meticulous research, extensively documented the Syrians and Phoenicians,
the maritime civilizations north of Egypt.
He even delved into their distinct practices, such as circumcision, tracing its origins to
Egyptian traditions.
However, when it came to Moses, the Jewish people, and their rich tapestry of laws and
literature, there's a conspicuous silence by the era in which Herodotus wrote circa
450 BCE.
The Jews, based on available Greek records, seem to be an enigmatic culture yet to capture
the attention of the broader Hellenic world.
Imagine attending a symposium with Plato, the imminent philosopher of ancient Greece.
He's the sort who effortlessly weaves references from various cultures into his conversations,
showcasing his encyclopedic knowledge of global legal systems.
In his seminal work, Plato's Laws, he delves deep into the Jewish prudence of Athens, Sparta,
Crete, even claims familiarity with Egyptian legal traditions.
He frequently alludes to the divine origins of these Laws, emphasizing their sacred nature
and the reverence with which these societies upheld them for generations.
If Plato thought Moses, or biblical literature and Laws worthy of adapting, he would have
made mention of it in his works.
Yet, a perplexing omission stands out.
If Plato's Laws drew inspiration from the ancient edicts of Moses, why is there no acknowledgement
of this influence?
Think of a sports fan discussing legendary athletes, but leaving out the achievements
of Olympic gold medalists.
The most plausible explanation, during Plato's era, the Greeks might have been largely unaware
of the Jewish cultural heritage.
The Jewish traditions, it seems, were an undiscovered treasure, eluding the discerning
eye of Greek scholars.
Now envision a scene at a historical trivia event, where the theme is luminaries of the
ancient world.
Things like Herodotus, Plato, and Aristotle would undoubtedly be the talk of the evening.
However, a puzzling conundrum arises.
Why did these intellectual giants, with their expansive writings, seemingly overlook the
Jews and Moses?
I mean they don't even mention them at all.
Herodotus often celebrated as the pioneering historian, chronicled the vast expanse of the
known Greek world but left out any mention of the Jews.
Plato, despite his philosophical musings that resonate with Jewish thought, never alluded
to any biblical influence.
An Aristotle, with his unparalleled collection of legal texts, seemingly lacked any reference
to Moses or his commandments.
It's as if one curated a playlist of timeless classics but omitted iconic bands like the
Beatles.
The enigma deepens when we consider that based on extant records, the Greeks' first
awareness of the Jews might have only emerged during the time of Alexander the Great.
Adding another layer of intrigue, even certain Jewish communities closely connected to the
spiritual epicenter in Jerusalem were seemingly unfamiliar with Moses and his commandments
until a similar period.
This assertion finds support in the ancient documents preserved at Elephantine.
This curious oversight remains one of the most captivating riddles in the annals of
history.
The Elephantine papyri, older than any existing copies of the Hebrew Bible, offers scholars
a unique window into Jewish practices in Egypt around the 5th century BCE.
These documents reveal a community that practiced a form of polytheistic Judaism, likely established
by Judean and Samaritan refugees escaping Assyrian and Babylonian invasions in the mid-6th
or mid-7th centuries BCE.
Interestingly, these texts seem to lack any reference to a written Torah or the stories
within it, including those of Moses and Joshua.
Another intriguing discovery from these papyri is the evidence of a Jewish temple in Elephantine,
active until at least 411 BCE.
This temple, which conducted incense and animal sacrifices, directly contradicts the Deuteronomic
Law that forbids any Jewish temple outside of Jerusalem.
Yet, these Elephantine Jews corresponded with the high priests in Jerusalem seeking financial
support to rebuild their temple.
This suggests that the Jerusalem temple authorities might not have been strictly adhering to the
Deuteronomic Law if they even knew of it.
The letters from Elephantine even express pride in their temple dedicated to Yahweh,
with no indication of their viewing that practice and that temple as heretical.
At first glance, these findings challenge traditional understandings of Jewish religious
evolution and the timeline of the Hebrew Scriptures.
It's generally believed that by the time these papyri were written, monotheism and
the Torah would have been firmly rooted in Jewish tradition.
Some scholars suggest that the Elephantine community might have preserved older Jewish
religious customs, or perhaps the Torah had only been introduced recently.
However, researchers like Nils Peter Lemke, Philip Vajenbaum, Russell Gamirkin, and Thomas
L. Thompson propose an intriguing idea.
They argue that the Elephantine papyri indicate that monotheism and the Torah might not have
been established in Jewish culture until around 400 BCE.
This could mean that the Torah was possibly composed during the Hellenistic period, around
the 3rd or 4th centuries BCE.
Add to this the discovery of the Passover letter in Elephantine which describes an annual
festival practice which makes no mention of an Exodus or Moses.
This seems to be an agricultural tradition with a Passover and the Day of Unleavened
Bread.
Even Julius Wellhausen suggests that these festivals predated the Moses tradition which
later incorporated Moses into them.
For a moment, suppose we were at an intellectual gathering in ancient times where the wine
flows freely and the conversation centers around the intriguing parallels between Greek
philosophy and the Hebrew Bible.
This wasn't a mere passing fancy, it was a topic that had intrigued scholars and thinkers
for generations.
Both Jewish and Christian intellectuals, as well as some from the pagan traditions,
were captivated by the striking resemblances particularly between the dialogues of Plato
and the Hebrew scriptures.
In such a gathering, you likely hear mentions of Aristobulus, circa 150 BCE, a pioneering
Jewish thinker who first drew attention to these parallels, Philo of Alexandria, 20
CE to 50 CE, around the time of Jesus, and Paul, and Flavius Josephus, 37 CE to 100 CE
or so.
We're now Jewish scholars who explored this theme in depth.
Christian luminaries such as Justin Martyr, circa 150 AD, Clement of Alexandria, 150 to
15 AD, Eusebius of Caesarea, 263 to 339 AD, and Augustine, 354 to 430 AD, who all contributed
their insights.
Even philosophers outside the Judeo-Christian fold, like Numenius of Appamea from the 2nd
century CE, found the topic too compelling to ignore.
The prevailing sentiment, most scholars well, versed in both Plato and Moses' writings,
were convinced of a direct connection.
Their reasoning was straightforward, the Hebrew scriptures claimed antiquity, surpassing
that of Greek literature.
Thus, any similarities were attributed to the Greeks, Plato included, drawing from the
ancient Jewish texts.
However, as with all great mysteries, a twist emerged.
The question is, what if the influence was the other way around?
What if the Hebrew Bible was in fact inspired by Plato and other Greek luminaries?
This radical perspective has sent ripples through the world of biblical scholarship,
suggesting that perhaps the Greeks were the original thinkers, as the Hebrew scribes were
the ones influenced.
Rewinding to the Hellenistic and Roman periods, the prevailing sentiment was akin to believing
that a cherished family recipe was the original, and all others were mere imitations.
The majority of Jewish, Christian, and even some pagan writers were of the conviction
that Jewish literature was the archetype predating its Greek counterparts.
Hence, any semblance between the two was attributed to Greek borrowings from Jewish sources.
This investigative zeal persisted through the ages, from the 1600s to the 1800s.
Scholars and researchers embarked on quests to identify instances where Greek literature
seemed to echo biblical narratives.
Even as the winds of modern biblical criticism began to blow in the 19th century, challenging
many entrenched beliefs this particular notion remained unshaken.
The dominant narrative persisted, the Jewish scriptures were the original, and Greek literature
a derivative.
After this intriguing historical puzzle, scholars widely recognize that the story of Noah and
Genesis, particularly the part where he releases three birds to find dry land, bears a striking
resemblance to the epic of Gilgamesh's 11th tablet.
Yet, does the Bible acknowledge this apparent inspiration?
Not at all.
It was only through meticulous research and analysis that these parallels were identified.
When translations of these ancient Mesopotamian tablets became possible thanks to tools like
the Rosetta Stone, many who revered the Bible initially argued that these older tablets
must have borrowed from the biblical texts.
Sounds absurd.
It's natural to resist new ideas that challenge long-held beliefs.
Scholars now, on consensus, think that the Bible is influenced by the Mesopotamians.
So here's a thought to ponder.
If there's a connection between Plato's writings in the Bible, which is more probable.
Did the Bible draw from Plato, without giving credit, as you've seen with the Mesopotamian,
or did Plato borrow from what was believed to be Moses' writings, without acknowledging
that he did so?
Interestingly, Plato was known to cite his sources openly, so would he suddenly choose
to omit a reference to Moses?
On the other hand, biblical authors often didn't specify where they sourced their
myths, philosophies, or laws.
We know, with the Hammurabi, for example, laws, there are some impact in ancient Near
Eastern law codes that found their way into the Bible.
Where do they get these?
Directly from God.
Russell Gamirkin has written several works, and one worthy of investigation on this subject
is called Plato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible.
His book journeys deep into why the biblical authors modeled their stuff after Greek Athenian
laws and various other codes, you really should give it a read.
But to sum up some of his arguments, and I want to give you something to stand on, let
me give you an idea of some of the things he says.
The intricate parallels between the biblical accounts of Moses and Joshua and Greek political
and legal structures suggest a deliberate borrowing from Greek traditions.
Notably, several features of the biblical narrative echo Athenian legal practices.
These include the tribal systems, the military leadership structure, the dual function of
tribes, kinship roles and legal matters, the broad definition of the household, similar
judicial processes, and a unique form of elective kingship.
While direct interactions between Athens and Judea before the Hellenistic period are scarce,
the similarities hint at the biblical authors' exposure to Greek political literature during
the Hellenistic era.
This is further supported by elements of mosaic writings that seem inspired by Plato's dialogues.
For instance, the biblical 12-tribe system and certain legal practices resonate more
with Plato's laws, or Hecateus of Abdera's Egyptica, than with historical Athenian reforms.
The Levitical expertise on sacred law in the Bible mirrors the exegetes from Plato's
laws, an Athenian religious group.
Additionally, the high priest's civic powers in the biblical account and the king's oversight
by priestly Levites seem to draw inspiration from Plato's depiction of governance in his
laws.
The Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, showcases legal structures that
seem strikingly different from those of the ancient Near East.
Indeed, they resonate more with the Greek democratic and egalitarian values introduced
during the Hellenistic era.
These laws evoke a society where land is equally divided among citizens, where a single law
governs all, and where the justice system is in the hands of the people, not a monarch.
Several legal genres in the Bible, such as constitutional and military law, are prevalent
in the Greek world, but absent in the ancient Near East.
Furthermore, many specific biblical laws echo Greek traditions, from the mythological concept
of spilled blood-seeking vengeance, like we see with Cain and Abel, for example, to the
legal management of inheritances.
Interestingly, some biblical laws are not just reminiscent of broader Greek traditions,
but seem to be directly influenced by Athenian practices.
Examples include laws related to homicide, the legal role of close kinsmen in inheritance
and marriage, the laws against interest loans, and permanent debt slavery.
Many of these Athenian-inspired laws also appear in Plato's Laws, suggesting that Jewish scholars
had access to this work.
Plato's Laws is the only ancient Greek text that systematically details the creation of
a constitution and law code.
Several laws in the Pentateute, such as the distinction between premeditated and unpremeditated
murder, seem to be directly borrowed from Plato's work.
Other laws in the Pentateute, from those against magic to those on gleaning, further indicate
a literary dependence on Plato's Laws.
In summary, while the Pentateute contains laws that diverge from the norms of ancient
Near East, they align closely with Greek and particularly Athenian legal traditions.
This suggests the biblical authors were not only familiar with, but also influenced by
Greek legal writings, especially Plato's Laws.
It won't do it justice in this video for me to tell you this, but if you go and read Russell
Gamerican's work, these books, and others who are in the same category in vain of minimalist
and Greek influence in the Bible, you will see what I'm saying and I'm not just telling
you a bunch of nonsense.
This is why ancients believed Plato copied Moses.
The antiquity argument kept them captivated and they couldn't get past this, but there
were so much in common, law code wise, and other reasons for them to see someone is copying
someone, someone knows someone, and I hope that you can go and read his work to find
out further on why that's the case.
Parallelomania, interesting cases of apparent parallels, Philip Vajemba.
Half the battle is one in showing that there is some literary dependence between the stories
of the Greeks and the Bible, which would entail Jews and Samaritans.
We won't expect the biblical authors to credit their sources for literary inspiration as
has been seen with the Gilgamesh epic, but in fact scholars have noticed dozens and dozens
of examples of the biblical corpus drawing inspiration from other sources without crediting
it.
The charge arises from Naysayers, quote unquote, this is Parallelomania.
It's crucial to understand that identifying these similarities isn't about overthinking
or what some might call seeing connections where there aren't any.
It's about recognizing the ancient author's skills in weaving and adapting familiar stories
to create richer tales.
While today's audience might see this as copying, back then it was seen as a tribute
and a way to elevate a narrative.
It took real genius to do the things you see in this literature.
So that was their modus operandi.
It was to repackage and craft their own skilled narrative using great tales of the time.
Dr. Vajemba and his book Argonauts of the Desert compared the similar myths on creation
and early humanity in the first chapter of his book.
And the Laws of Plato in the chapters on Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, also
in that same book.
Most of these parallels were then rediscovered with additional evidence by Russell Gamirkin.
His book and all of their books are far too large to cover everything he says on this topic.
But to tease you, look at the contents that I'm about to show you right now on the screen.
Here you have introduction, hypotheses, and thesis.
He talks about various things and being very critical in like reconsidering the whole documentary
hypothesis.
I believe as I read through here, he wants to say considering this the Hellenistic documentary
hypothesis or something to the effect of the Greek influence on it.
But what's interesting if you look carefully, he goes through from Genesis all the way to
the first Kings.
In the beginning was Timaeus, the splitting of the Adrogyny, the splitting of the Adrogyny,
the Golden Age, Eve Pandora, the first murder and the demigods, Cain and Alcaman, the Flood,
the castration of Oranos, the drunkenness of Noah, the Table of Nations, Tower of Abel,
Abraham, and he goes into various Greek connections to these figures.
And I'm reading these and I'm seeing what he's saying and how it makes really a ton
of sense.
He's talking to somebody here.
He goes through Jacob, goes all the way to the Exodus, the Pharaoh, Moses, all of these
with its Greek connections.
Goes into the quarrel of the Elephantine, talking about what we discussed a little earlier
but I'm sure he goes into other details.
Leviticus talking about Laws here, going into Numbers, going into Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
Samuel.
And there's so much here that has very similar narratives in the Greek world and I really
just hope that people will go and read his book, Argonauts of the Desert, so they can
actually go.
This should tease you here with the contents.
My reading of it, I feel that the honest seeker will at least walk away from this book agreeing
that these comparisons are too vast to ignore.
Someone is copying someone without a doubt.
His book's premise is that Genesis threw Kings as a sort of platonic epic, written as a cohesive
story.
Whether all of his parallels are in fact there, it's like what Dennis McDonald said, when
the camel's head is peaking under the tent and you can see enough mimesis on the New
Testament authors to Homeric reflections, if you will, and also maybe even the Aeneid
other writings.
You can't help but realize it's happening, so you're looking for it in other places.
This book is another place I would go to for the Hebrew Bible and looking at these narratives.
How are they structured?
A lot of these look Greek, or at least have Greek influence in how they have constructed
the narrative.
It's very difficult to show how the Bible uses Plato or the other way around.
Even if we show parallels that are commencing to you, the viewer, that one of them is aware
of the other, the idea that Plato being used by these biblical authors, or author, is something
that must be argued on different grounds, and since I'm no expert on languages and cannot
show you how one could be proven to be before the other, I will rely on Dr. Vagembaum's
comparisons, which come closest to showing the biblical author seems to be aware of Plato.
It's important to know all the other reasons listed from Elephantine and on and on and
on why these books and their narratives would have been influenced by the Greeks.
The case for Noah's drunkenness itself is a good example of how the author of Genesis
rewrote a Greek myth, keeping at least two Greek names, Ayyepet, Japheth, and Aion, Yavon.
His understanding is that Ham, seeing Noah naked, might be a sort of euphemism for the
castration of Noah, as is known in rabbinic sources.
What is more is that Plato meant to censor that story from Hesiod about Kronos castrating
Uranus, so there's a chance that the author of Genesis rewrote Greek myths specifically
according to Plato's advice on poetry in the Republic.
This is why when people read about the nakedness of Noah, they're confused.
What actually happened?
There's a censorship here, not actually telling you what really took place, even though it
seems to be sexual in dealing with body parts we can't talk about here on YouTube.
The Bible particularly, the Old Testament, is replete with prophecies and verses that
have been interpreted in various ways over the centuries.
Two such verses, often cited in discussions about the Greek influence in the Near East,
are found in Genesis 9.27 and Numbers 24.24.
The verse made Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem from Genesis 9.27 has been seen by
some scholars as a foreshadowing of the Greek expansion into the Near East.
Here, Japheth, one of Noah's sons, is often associated with the Greeks, while Shem is
linked to the Semitic peoples of the Near East.
The idea is that this verse predicts the Greeks, Japheth, settling or establishing dominance
in the territories of the Semitic peoples, Shem.
Similarly, Numbers 24.24 speaks of a fleet coming from Kittim, subjugating Eber and
Assur.
This has been interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great's conquest.
While Alexander primarily advanced through the land, he did face significant resistance
during the Siege of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city.
To overcome this, he sought naval reinforcements from Cyprus, historically associated with
Kittim, or Kittian, its ancient capital.
Thus, the fleet from Kittim can be seen as a symbolic representation of these reinforcements.
These interpretations suggest that the Pentateuch, or at least parts of it, might have been redacted
or edited during the Hellenistic era, post the conquest of Alexander the Great.
The mention of Kittim, which is historically linked to Cyprus, further strengthens this
argument.
Another argument is, in the Biblical count of 1 Kings 22, 1-23, we find King Ahab of
Israel gearing up for a battle against Arem.
Before making any moves, he forms an alliance with Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah.
As was customary, they sought guidance from the prophets of Israel.
These prophets almost in unison predicted a triumphant victory over Arem.
However, Jehoshaphat, perhaps seeking a second opinion, insisted on hearing from the prophet
Micah.
Micah's vision was starkly different.
He described a celestial scene where he witnessed the heavenly hosts gathered around the divine
figure Yahweh.
In this vision, Yahweh permitted a deceptive spirit to influence the other prophets, making
them prophesy a victory for Ahab.
The twist?
This was a ruse, and Ahab was destined to fall in the ensuing battle.
Intriguingly, this narrative bears a striking resemblance to the earlier chapters of the
ancient Greek epic, the Iliad.
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here of whom we may inquire?
The King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one other by whom we may inquire
of the Lord, Micah, son of Imlah.
But I hate him, for he never prophesies anything favorable about me, but only disaster.
1 Kings 22, 7-8.
With these words, he sat down, an Agamemnon rose in anger.
His heart was black with rage.
His eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchus, and said, Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied
smooth things concerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil.
You have brought me neither comfort nor performance, and now you come seeing among Danans and saying
that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter
of Cresus, Iliad 1-100-110.
Then Micah said, Therefore hear the word of the Lord.
I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing beside him
to the right and to the left of him.
And the Lord said, Who will entice Ahab, so that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?
Then one said one thing, and another said another.
Until a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying I will entice him.
How?
The Lord asks him.
He replied, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
Then the Lord said, You are to entice him, and you shall succeed.
Go out and do it.
So you see the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets.
The Lord has decreed disaster for you."
1 Kings 22 19-23 Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the
plains slept soundly, but Zeus was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honor to Achilles,
and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans.
In the end, he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agnamemnon.
So he called one to him and said to it, Lying dream, Go to the ships of the Achaeans, into
the tent of Agnamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you.
Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy.
There are no longer divided councils among the gods.
Hera has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans.
The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the ships of the Achaeans.
It sought Agnamemnon's son of Atreus, and found him in his tent, wrapped in a profound
slumber.
It hovered over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of Nileus, whom Agnamemnon honored
above all his councilors, and said, You are sleeping, son of Atreus.
One who has the welfare of his host, and so much other care upon his shoulders, should
dock his sleep.
Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Zeus, who though he be not near, yet
takes thought for you, and pities you.
He bid you, get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy.
There are no longer divided councils among the gods.
Hera has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of
Zeus.
Remember this, and when you wake, see that it does not escape you.
The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were surely not to be accomplished.
He thought that on the same day he was to take the city of Priam, but he little knew
what was in the mind of Zeus, who had many another hard-fought fights in store alike
for the Danans and Trojans.
Then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his ears, so he sat upright
and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak.
He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver, studded sword about
his shoulders.
Then he took the imperishable staff of his father, and sailed forth to the ships of the
Achaeans."
In, quote, Iliad 2.1-50.
In Plato's Republic, he expresses strong disapproval of the way gods are portrayed in Homer's works.
Plato is critical of the misleading and often unflattering depictions of deities in these
epic tales.
He believes that such portrayals can have a negative influence on the moral and ethical
values of society.
For Plato, the gods should be represented as paragons of virtue and righteousness, not
as flawed beings with human-like weaknesses and vices.
Even no motive can be imagined why gods should lie.
None whatever.
Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?
They ask?
Yes.
Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed?
He changes not, he deceives not?
Either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision?
Your thoughts, he said, are the reaction of my own.
You agree with me, then, I said that this is the second type or form in which we should
write and speak about divine things.
The gods are not magicians who transform themselves.
Neither do they deceive mankind in any way.
I grant that.
Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying dream which Zeus
sends to Agnum and Nonne.
Plato, Republic, 382-83b.
The parallels between the biblical narrative and Greek mythology are striking and deeply
significant.
The story in Genesis 2 Kings can be seen as a reimagining of Greek myths, but through
a lens influenced by Plato's philosophy.
The episode in 1 Kings 22, where a deceptive spirit is sent to Ahab, mirrors the Iliad's
account of a misleading dream sent to Agnum and Nonne.
However, there's a twist in the biblical tale.
Micah, a true prophet of God, exposes the divine intention behind the deception.
While Agnum and Nonne was left to his fate by Zeus, Ahab is given a chance by God, highlighting
the different moral landscape of the two narratives.
A notable similarity is Ahab's disdain for Micah.
As he always prophesies unfavorable outcomes, this mirrors the relationship between Agnum
and Nonne in the Seer Calcus in the Iliad.
Agnum and Nonne expresses frustration with Calcus for always delivering bad news, a sentiment
echoed almost verbatim by Ahab in the biblical account.
This fingerprint suggests a deliberate thematic borrowing by the biblical writer.
The choice of this particular Iliadic episode is intriguing, especially given Plato's criticism
of it.
The biblical writer seems to be not just borrowing from the Iliad, but also correcting
it in line with Plato's principles from the Republic.
Furthermore, the manner of Ahab's death has echoes of Agnum and Nonne's fate.
Agnum and Nonne injured in battle and dragged behind his chariot finds a parallel in Ahab's
demise, further cementing the connection between the two narratives.
But a certain man drew his bow and unknowingly struck the king of Israel between the scale
armor and the breastplate.
So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn around and carry me out of the battle,
for I am wounded.
The battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the
aramans, until at evening he died.
The blood from the wound had fallen into the bottom of the chariot.
Then at sunset, a shout went through the army, every man to his city and every man to his
country.
1 Kings 22, 34-36, Elithia, goddess of childbirth, daughters of Hera, and dispensers of cruel
pain, sinned upon a woman when she is in labor, even so sharp with the pangs of the son of
Atreus.
He sprang on to his chariot and bade his charioteer, drive to the ships, for he was in great agony.
With a loud, clear voice he shouted to the Danayans, My friends, princes, and counselors
of the Argives, defend the ship yourselves.
For Zeus has not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans.
With this, the charioteer turned his horses toward the ships.
They flew forward, nothing lost.
Their chests were white, with foam, and their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded
king out of the battle.
Iliad 11, 270-80.
Dr. Vajnbaum's perspective offers a fascinating lens through which to view the biblical narrative.
The idea that biblical Israel mirrors Plato's ideal state from the Laws is a compelling one.
Plato's vision of an ideal state is a utopia governed by reason, justice, and harmony.
In contrast, the biblical account in Judges, Samuel, and Kings paints a picture of Israel's
gradual decline from its utopian beginnings.
The decision to appoint a king rather than adhering to the divinely ordained tribal system
marks the beginning of this decline.
The trajectory of Israel's kings is reminiscent of Plato's depiction of the degeneration of
rulers in his works.
Just as Plato outlines the descendant from philosopher Kings to tyrants in his republic,
the biblical narrative charts the transformation of Israel's kings from divinely chosen leaders
to tyrants who lead their people astray.
The repeated failures of the kings, their frequent turn to idolatry, and the eventual
downfall of both the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah can be seen
as a reflection of the decline of Plato's ideal state.
Furthermore, the parallel drawn between this narrative and Plato's myth of Atlantis is
intriguing.
In the Critias, Atlantis is portrayed as a powerful and advanced civilization that eventually
falls out of favor with the gods due to its hubris and moral decay.
The destruction of Atlantis serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of abandoning virtue
and justice.
Similarly, the downfall of Israel and Judah in the biblical narrative can be interpreted
as a divine punishment for the repeated transgressions and abandonment of God's commandments.
In essence, the biblical narrative might be seen as a reimagining of platonic themes where
the ideals of a just and harmonious society are set against the backdrop of human frailty
and moral decline.
The story of Israel's rise and fall serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges inherent
in upholding a divinely inspired vision of society in the face of human imperfections.
The parallels between the biblical narratives and Plato's dialogues, as highlighted in the
mentioned framework, suggest a profound interplay of ideas and motifs.
Let's delve deeper into these connections.
Creation Myths and Genesis and Platonic Dialogues
The biblical account of creation in Genesis, where the world is formed out of chaos, bears
resemblance to Plato's Timaeus.
In Timaeus, the universe is crafted by divine craftsmen using eternal forms and the chaotic
receptacle.
The idea of love and desire as primal forces in symposium can also be juxtaposed with the
divine love that brings forth creation in Genesis.
The Flood and Patriarchal Era The biblical flood narrative, followed by
the patriarchal era, found echoes in Plato's Laws, where he recounts ancient cataclysms
that wiped out civilizations, leaving only the unlettered and uncultured to repopulate
the earth.
Liberation in Exodus and the Cave Allegory The Exodus story, where the Israelites are
liberated from Egyptian bondeds, can be seen in parallel with Plato's Cave Allegory in
the Republic.
Just as the prisoners in the Cave move from darkness to light, the Israelites move from
slavery to freedom, not to mention the flames producing shadows in Plato's Cave and the
burning bush in Exodus.
Acceptance of the Laws The ceremony where Moses presents the Laws
to the Israelites in Exodus 24 is reminiscent of a similar passage in Plato's Critias,
emphasizing the sacredness and divine origin of Laws.
Laws in the Pentateuch and Plato's Laws Several Laws and moral codes in the Pentateuch
have parallels with the legal and ethical prescriptions in Plato's Laws.
Both sets of Laws aim to create a just and harmonious society.
We will cover these Laws in depth in future episodes at some point.
Conquest and Division in Joshua The biblical account of the Israelites conquering
Canaan and dividing it by Lot mirrors the ideal states established in Plato's Laws.
Both narratives emphasize order, divine guidance, and the importance of land distribution for
societal harmony, downfall from Judges to Kings and the Atlantis myth.
The gradual, moral, and societal decline depicted from the Book of Judges to Kings can be likened
to the story of Atlantis in Plato's Dialogues.
Atlantis, once a paragon of civilization, falls into a decadence and is eventually punished
by the gods.
Similarly, Israel, initially established under divine guidance, deteriorates over time leading
to divine retribution.
In essence, the biblical narrative, when viewed through this platonic lens, appears to be
a tapestry woven with threads of platonic philosophy, ethics, and metaphysics.
This intertextual reading enriches our understanding of both the Bible and Plato's works, highlighting
the universality of certain themes and ideas across different cultures and times.
Dr. Vajambam's hypothesis is indeed intriguing, suggesting that Plato's political writings
serve as a foundational structure upon which major Greek myths, epics, and even the histories
of Herodotus were constructed.
This perspective posits that these narratives were not just isolated tales, but were interwoven
with platonic philosophy, thereby offering a cohesive model for understanding the narrative
from Genesis to Kings.
Let's break down the implications and challenges of this hypothesis.
Accumulation of Parallels
One of the primary supports for this theory is the accumulation of parallels between
platonic writings and these narratives.
While individual parallels might be dismissed as coincidental, the sheer number and consistency
of these parallels make a compelling case for a deliberate intertextual relationship, consistent
interpretive model.
If we accept the premise that Genesis through Kings is a sort of platonic epic, it offers
a unified interpretive model.
This means that the biblical narratives can be read not just as historic or religious
text, but also as philosophical treatises, echoing platonic ideals.
Challenges in Establishing Direct Influence
One of the main challenges in this hypothesis is establishing a direct line of influence.
While parallels exist, proving that the biblical authors had direct access to and were influenced
by platonic writings is challenging.
The historical timelines, cultural contexts, and transmission methods all need to be considered.
Interpreting the Purpose
If the biblical narratives were indeed influenced by platonic thought, what was the purpose?
Was it to align the Hebrew God's teachings with the philosophical ideals of the time?
Or was it an attempt to provide a counter-narrative to the dominant Greek philosophical discourse?
Political Criticisms
Such a hypothesis is bound to face criticisms.
Traditionalists might argue that the biblical texts were divinely inspired and not influenced
by human philosophical thought.
Others might point out that similarities and themes could be due to the universality of
certain ideas rather than direct borrowing.
While Dr. Vajambam's theory offers a fresh lens to view biblical and Greek narratives,
it requires a careful examination of the evidence and an open-minded approach to ancient texts
interpretation.
The idea that Genesis through Kings can be seen as a platonic epic is a testament to
the richness and depth of these ancient narratives, which continue to inspire scholarly debate
and interpretation.
Another one to cover in Plato's Symposium, there's a captivating tale about the birth
of love known as Eros.
The story goes that during a divine banquet, Poros, symbolizing abundance, overindulged
in nectar and drifted into a slumber in a garden.
Pena, representing poverty, arrived at this feast primarily in search of sustenance, seizing
an opportunity she decided to conceive a child with the inebriated Poros.
From this union, Eros or love was born.
Intriguingly, Eros embodies both affluence and need, reflecting the natures of his parents.
This narrative bears a striking resemblance to the biblical account in Ruth 3.
Here, Ruth, a destitute woman, patiently waits for the wealthy Boaz to fall into a drunken
sleep after a celebration.
She then discreetly positions herself at his feet.
Upon waking, Boaz is met with Ruth's proposal of marriage.
Given his familial ties to her late husband, this union would later lead to them becoming
the great grandparents of King David, whose name fittingly translates to Beloved.
Much like Eros signifies love.
The underlying theme in both tales is evident.
A woman in a disadvantaged position seeks a union with a more affluent male figure.
While Plato's version serves as a divine allegory, the book of Ruth offers a more humanized rendition,
chronically the lineage of David.
It's essential to note that drawing such parallels isn't an exercise in over-analysis,
often dubbed parallelomania.
Instead, it's a testament to the ancient author's penchant for embedding and reimagining
existing narratives to enrich their compositions.
Modern readers might misconstrue this as plagiarism, but ancient writers view it as a form of homage
and enhancement.
To clarify, this isn't an attempt to undermine the Bible's significance.
Instead, it's an acknowledgement of its literary brilliance, placing it on par with the masterpieces
of Greek and Roman antiquity, whose guilty Plato or the Bible, Moses, the verdict.
It is with soberness that I confess this puzzle to be ultimately subjective in conclusion.
But I do think without a doubt, we have good reason to lean in the direction the Bible
is aware and using Homer, Herodotus, other Greek writings in Plato.
This video specifically focused on Plato and that age-old debate of who borrowed from whom.
I needed to emphasize this important video before proceeding to show you the origins
of the Bible characters and unravel the mysteries inside the Bible.
Those who are interested in these historical questions will understand why this video is
necessary in the unfolding series of videos which will expose you to ideas not found everywhere.
The odds that this small group of people in the region of Canaan made such an impression
on Plato, who was transparent on where he received his ideas without shame, but saw bragging
about his learnings as something to boast about and never mentioned Moses, impacted him and
not the other way around seems a bit far-fetched to me.
The hard evidence from archaeology suggests the people and religion we call Jews and Judaism
as described by the Bible was not practiced till the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE.
The Elephantine Papyri show no awareness to the greatest law giver in the Bible, Moses.
They show much more than the absence of Moses.
But how Jerusalem gave a nod and support in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE to a temple
other than Jerusalem in Elephantine Egypt worshipping Yah and these people were polytheistic.
You see something just doesn't add up for the position Plato used Moses.
