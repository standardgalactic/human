get ready for a mind bending journey
because this video is about to challenge even the most serious seekers of knowledge
who yearn to unravel the creation accounts in Genesis.
we're diving deep into Genesis 1 through 3
where you will find the captivating twin creation narratives of the Bible.
My last video on Genesis 1 through 3
we showed potential mythical antecedents to the Enuma Elish
epic of Gilgamesh, Atrahasis epic
song of the hoe
and I'm talking about an instrument that is used in agricultural farming
and several other Mesopotamian connections
but there may be better parallels to the Greek world
now hold on tight because Biblical scholars have long attributed these accounts to two different authors
drawing from the well-known documentary hypothesis
in the first account, Genesis 1
we witness the awe-inspiring creation of the heavens and the earth
emerging from a primordial chaos
all meticulously laid out within the span of seven days
this narrative prominently features the name Elohim
representing God in the pea or priestly source
but then the plot thickens
as we shift gears to Genesis 2 through 3
transporting us to the enchanting Garden of Eden
here we encounter tales of animal and human creation
the fabled tree of knowledge of good and evil
and the origin of sin and death
notice how everything is initially crafted as very good
in Genesis 1
only to watch and witness the entry of sin and death into the world
in Genesis 2 through 3
all attributed to a deity with a different name
isn't that intriguing
it bears a striking resemblance to Plato's creation accounts
and we'll delve into that connection together
so brace yourself
for centuries these twin creation stories with their distinct divine names
Yahweh Elohim in Genesis 2 through 3
have been regarded as separate accounts
written by different authors
possibly centuries apart
eventually intertwined by a clumsy scribe
endeverring to preserve diverse traditions
in the opening chapters of our Bibles
these stories rooted in ancient Mesopotamian myths
form a picture of twin creation narratives
combined by the biblical editors of Genesis
but wait,are things really as they seem?
in the most recent book by Russell Gamirkin
a fascinating perspective emerges
Gamirkin proposes
that Genesis 1 through 3
constitutes a singular unified creation story
divided into two parts
featuring not just one
but two distinct gods
the first is the supreme cosmic creator
portrayed in Genesis 1
while the second is Yahweh
a lowly descendant
and one of the biblical sons of God
who ruled over the land of Eden
intriguing,isn't it?
this two-part creation story
astonishingly finds its origins in a single Greek source
the renowned work of Plato called Timaeus
exploring the origins of the cosmos
so in this video
we will embark on a riveting exploration of Genesis 1 through 3
pilling back the layers of these ancient texts
and uncovering the astonishing connections
to Plato's ideas
get ready to have your mind expanded
as we challenge long-held assumptions
and embark on a scholarly and intellectually stimulating journey
through the Genesis creation accounts
Rosselgamerkin's revolutionary approach
to the origins of the biblical text
is anything but conventional
while most biblical scholars
focus solely on ancient Mesopotamian sources
gamerkin takes a bold leap
and looks at the Greek sources as well
yes you heard that right
the Greek sources
why limit ourselves right
here's the thing
the earliest textual evidence for the Old Testament
or Hebrew Bible
emerges quite late
in the third century BC
after Alexander the Great's conquest
during the Hellenistic era
and during this time
the Jews had access to a treasure trove
of Greek literaturein the illustrious library of Alexandria
so why not entertain the notion
that the Bible might have been written
as late as the Hellenistic era
drawing from Greek sources
why should we turn a blind eye
to the vast realm of Greek literature
it's time to expand our horizons
over the years I've had the privilege
of interviewingsome of the world's foremost experts
and an intriguing trend
has emerged on the horizon
archaeologist Yanatan Adler
renowned for his work
on the origins of Judaism
has unearthed concrete physical evidence
suggesting that this religion
didn't truly flourish
until well after the Hellenistic period
specificallyduring the Hasmonean dynasty
and beyond
Adler makes a compelling point
there is a lack of archeological evidence
supportingthe practiceof the religion
describedin the Biblical corpus
by Jews or Israelitesduring the periods
written aboutin this literature
in fact,he has said something like
there is zero evidence to suggest
Jews were practicing this religion
before the second century BCE
he's open to being challenged
but the strong evidence points in his favor
as we do find ample evidence
emergingduring the second century BCE
after the Hasmonean dynasty
mark my words
more scholars will increasingly embrace
the idea of Hellenistic composition
for the Bible in the coming years
this is my prediction
I can see the writingon the wall
so whilegamerican examines
bothancient Mesopotamian sources
and relatively recent Greek sources
it's the Greek parallels
that often prove to be more captivating
and persuasive
and what better example to illustrate this
than the Biblical creation stories
themselves
consider the creation account of Genesis 1
gamerican notes that creation myths
from ancient Mesopotamian
even many from the Greeks
three major types
so let's go over them
one of those types are theogonies
in the world of theogonies
we encounter texts
that explore the origin of gods
depicting their genealogy
birthand divine lineage
these mythic accounts
portray a multitude of divine beings
innerlinked by family ties
with younger gods emerging
as offspring of their elder counterparts
the primary aim of a theogony
is to organizeand trace
the intricate family relations
in these godsrevealing the mosaic
of divine generations
one of the earliestmost renowned
and authoritative theogonies
preservedin written form
is Hesiod's Theogony
which dates backto around
700 BCEin the ancient Greece
however the concept ofanthropomorphic
family groupsof gods extends
far beyond Greece
spanning across various civilizations
in the ancient Near East
in Egypt we witness the portrayal
of gods and anthropomorphic
family structures
as exemplifiedin Plutarch's
work on Isis and Osiris
Babylonia represents its own version
of divine lineagein the Enuma Elish
while Assyria depicts these dynamics
the Assyrian redaction
of the Enuma Elish
featuring Asher as the
replacement for Marduk
the Hurrians and Hittites
contribute to this rich tradition
with their epic of Kumarbi
and the Phoenicians as evidenced
by Philo of Biblos
add their unique perspective
the Canaanite ugaritic texts
of Ras Shamra particularly in the
Cycle explicitly reveals similar themes
of divine family connections
notably the Canaanite tradition
of El and his 70 sons
directly influences the Biblical text
here the god of the children of Israel
is often associatedwith either El
the ruler of the divine council
or one of El's sons
these echoes of divine familial
relationships resonate
throughout Biblical narratives
for further exploration
and detailed sources
on the topics discussedin this video
I recommend referringto
Gomirkin's book
it serves as a valuable resource
shedding lighton the origins
and interconnectednessof these ancient texts
now let us journey into
Hesiod's Theogony itself
within its pages we encounter gods
that are not mere rulersof the heavens
and the earth
but rather embodythe very essence
of nature
Chaos the first god
is followed by Gaia
the earth
and Uranus the sky
these godsare notjust associated
with their domains
they are believed to be inseparable
from the divine manifestations
of sky and earththemselves
as Hesiod's Theogony unfolds
we discover a pantheonof gods
descendingfrom chaos and Gaia
including deities such as
Hemera day
Oribos darkness or night
Hilios the sun
Heline the moon
Oceanus the world stream
or ocean
Pontus the sea
and many others
in this mythical account
Theogony and Cosmogony intertwine
as the generation of the world
becomes intertwinedwith the activities
of the godstheir companionship
and their role as parents
natural phenomena
the essence of life
find explanations through the actions
of these gods
while not explicitly detailed
in the Theogony
the life giving rain is understood
as the heavenly spermata
that impregnates gay
the earth
bringing forthplant life
after showers
yes you read that right
the imagery evokes the notion
of the heavens and the earth
reaching in a metaphorical union
to bring forth life
now you know a little bit about
the enchanting world of ancient myths
and theogonies
where divine generations and cosmic
activities intertwine
from the genealogy of gods
to the birth of the world itself
these narratives offer profound insights
into the origins of existence
intertwining natural phenomena
with the divine realms
along with the ancient
categories
are theomokies
imagine a colossal celestial
showdown
where the gods themselves
engage in an epic battle
a theomokie
if you will
these divine clashes often had
Cataclismic consequences here on earth
But here's the twist
When one supreme God is defeated paving the way for another
To take the throne
We enter the realm of succession myths
These are stories about gods that likely sprouted
from the historical replacement of one ruling cult by another
Much like what happens when conquest or migration
reshapes the power dynamics
Let me tell you, succession myths sometimes manifested as a series of ages, each marked by its own cosmic catastrophe.
Take the Greeks for example, they had the age of Oranos, where the cosmos itself burst into existence,
followed by the age of Kronos, a golden era that birthed the race of humanity, the magnificent golden race.
And then, brace yourselves, we have the age of Zeus, which witnessed the rise and fall of not just one, but four successive human races.
We're talking about the silver race, the bronze race, the race of heroes whose swan song coincided with the infamous Trojan war, and finally our current iron race.
Talk about a tumultuous timeline.
Now the shift from the age of Oranos to the age of Kronos didn't involve a full-blown theamaki.
It was a relatively straightforward case of good old parasite, killing off of the parent.Nothing too dramatic, right?
But when it comes to transitioning from the age of Kronos to the age of Zeus, oh boy, buckle up for the titanamaki.
This was a full-blown war of the Titans, a theamaki in all its glory.
And guess what?The destruction of the bronze age of man orchestrated by Zeus also seemed to come with its fair share of cataclysmic upheaval.
However, let's be clear, none of these Greek cosmic shake-ups directly involved cosmogony itself, the creation of the universe.
They were more about the divine power struggles and the changing of the guard.
But hey, who needs cosmogony when you have feuding gods and awe-inspiring catastrophes to keep things interesting, right?
In the mystical tapestry of the ancient Near East, we find the captivating Enuma Alish, a tell, where gods clashed in an awe-inspiring theamaki.
Here, Marduk, the valiant deity, squares off against Tiamat, the formidable primordial dragon representing watery chaos.
But this battle is no ordinary divine scuffle.It carries within it explicit elements of mythical cosmogony.
Picture this, Marduk and his forces vanquished Tiamat and her formidable army.
As a triumphant display of cosmic craftsmanship, Marduk skillfully cleaves Tiamat's body into two halves,
with the upper part becoming the vast expanse of the sky and the lower part forming the solid earth beneath our feet.
But Marduk's creative endeavors do not end there.
From the blood of a slain, beheaded god, he breathes life into humanity and establishes Babylon as his glorious abode.
Talk about divine multitasking.
Moving forward, we encounter Borosus and his Babylonica, where he recounts Marduk's original mythological triumph.
But he takes it a step further by presenting an allegorical interpretation that caters to a significantly literate Greek audience.
In this version, Tiamat morphs into a symbol of the primordial darkness and water that existed before our present cosmos.
This sounds like Genesis 1's demythologizing narrative.
Marduk,in turn, is seen as the radiant sun or the embodiment of light.
And those winds?
Well,they likely represent the ethereal atmosphere bridging the heavens and the earth,
a poetic nod to the forces that aid Marduk in his victorious campaign.
Borosus adds a touch of symbolic depth by allegorizing the creation of humans from the blood of a fallen god.
This act suggests that mankind possesses a spark of divine wisdom,an intimate connection to the gods themselves.
A rather profound notion,wouldn't you agree?
Now,it's worth mentioning that not all Akkadian Theomachies ventured into the realm of Cosmogony,but when they did,oh boy,the cosmos became a stage for celestial battles,divine craftsmanship,and allegorical musings on the nature of existence.
The Ancient Near East truly knew how to infuse their mythologies with intellectual flair.
In that realm of ancient cosmogonies,the gods of Canaan have not left behind preserved narratives.
However,within the Ugarit Baal cycle,a window opens to an intriguing tradition,where Theomachie,the divine battle between gods,illuminates the origins of the world.
In this cycle,the valiant Baal emerges victorious over Yam,the embodiment of the unruly sea,while also triumphing over Mott and Loten.
These triumphs suggest a rich tradition that perceives the creation of the world through the lens of divine conflict.
Moreover,echoes of older Canaanite traditions reverberate through the conquest of Rehab and Leviathan,enigmatic sea dragons within biblical texts.
The battles between Yahweh and Rehab in Job 9 verse 13,as well as Yahweh and Leviathan bear the markings of a bygone mythical cosmogony,a glimpse into a time when the origin of the world was envisioned as a Theomachie,a clash between gods.
What unites these battles of cosmic significance is a recurring motif,an embattled deity,a conqueror facing off against a sea creature that embodies the forces of watery chaos.
The battle between God and Rehab alludes to us in various biblical texts,most notably in Psalms and Job,yet curiously,the cosmic battle motif remains absent from the renowned Genesis 11-23 account.
It seems the author consciously chose to strip it of its mythical potential,leaving us to ponder the significance of this omission.
Thus,as we delve into these ancient mysteries,we encounter big mosaic woven with divine conflicts and primordial chaos.
The battles between Marduk and Tiamat,Bal and Yam,and the biblical God and Rehab or Leviathan,offer us glimpses into the human of fascination and imagination with cosmic struggles.
In these monumental clashes,the conqueror faces off against the chaotic forces of the sea,shaping the very fabric of existence.
While the battle between God and Rehab is alluded to in biblical texts,the cosmic battle motif remains concealed within the Genesis account,leaving us to contemplate its significance,a captivating enigma that invites further exploration.
However,the lack of this mythical Theomache in Genesis 11-24should have us ask whether Borosis and Plato's creation accounts have something to offer us.
Polatial World Myths
In this type of mythical cosmogony,the world as a whole was envisioned in architectural imagery as a palace or temple laid out and constructed by a god pictured as a king who ruled the cosmos.
Such cosmogonies typically featured mythical geography on a world scale that mapped features of the visible and invisible world to architecture features of a royal construction.
In the book of Job,the portrait of God as divine designer and architect of the world,plum line literally in his hand is explicit.
The foundations of the world palace were laid deep in the invisible underworld.
The earth itself was the interior of the palace,its roof of sealing the sky above.
The heavens might be conceived as a solid surface constructed out of beaten brass or iron or as a tent like fabric spread out across the skies,
depending on the form of the construction envisioned.
The pillars that held up the sky were usually conceived as distant mountains located at the ends of the earth.
As ruler of the universe,the king of the gods was usually pictured as dwelling in a throne room in the heavens.
Consequently,the heavens were sometimes pictured as the floor of the celestial throne room constructed of jeweled crystals,
as was typical of royal palaces,the divine palace or temple contained numerous storerooms for its treasures.
In both the Hebrew Bible and in one Enoch,these divine treasures were pictured as storehouses containing the elements such as rain,
snow,and hell.In this mythical conception of the physical world,various windows were opened in the sky
to allow servants of the divine ruler to allow in rain,snow,hell,or winds.
Gates in the east were opened to allow the entry of the sun,moon,and stars,which were transported across the heavens by the angels to whom they were entrusted.
And other gates in the west allowed their departure from the sky.
Other gates or stairways allowed passage between the heavenly realm and earth.
In the palatial world myth,the ruler of the universe was often pictured as presiding over a divine bureaucracy of lesser gods
or angels who acted as royal servants,scribes,and bureaucrats.
Divine royal servants were pictured as having been charged with supervising the natural elements and ensuring the orderly operation of the cosmos according to the king's directions.
Such cosmological speculations assumed an earlier mythical cosmogony in which the world palace,what's constructed and its bureaucracy put in place,
even when the antecedent story of the architectural design and building of the cosmos has not been preserved.
Yet,Genesis is none of these types of Mesopotamian or Greek creation myths,as we covered all three.
Instead,as many biblical scholars note,Genesis 1 is largely demythologized.
Brief,concise,with a minimum of story and many scientific explanations,like the cosmologies of the Greek natural philosophers from Thales to Plato.
Indeed,as Gamirkin notes,Genesis 1 is strikingly reminiscent of Plato's Timaeus,a partly mythical,mostly scientific account of the fashioning of the cosmos by the supreme,eternal,monotheistic god of creation that Plato calls the dimmy urge or craftsman.
This craftsman,or creator god,who dwelled outside the material universe,took the original primordial chaos postulated by all Greek philosophers and transformed it into a beautiful orderly universe,good and perfect in all respects.
The craftsman started by separating out the elements of earth,water,air,and fire or light from the primordial chaos,rendering the universe visible.
He assigned solid land,water,and air to their proper regions with the fiery sky up above in the dome of the firmament,setting the sky spinning above the earth in a new sequence of day and night,thereby creating time.
He then fashioned the sun and moon and set them in their proper places in the sky.
He created the various orders of life,the creeping and four-footed animals of the earth,the birds of the sky,and the fish of the deep,the exact same categories found in Genesis 1,and he rejoiced over his creation,declaring its supremely good like himself.
Finally,he rested from the work of creation,happy to oversee the beautiful world he created from his distant,eternal dwelling beyond the heavens.
Gamerican notes the systematic parallels between Tamaeus by Plato and the creation account of Genesis 1.Let's take a look.
The separation of earth and seas,creation of plants,days,months,and years,creation of celestial bodies,creation of sea creatures and birds,creation of land animals,creation of humankind,completion of the cosmos and the creator at rest,creation of mortal life by the gods,which leads into another chapter in Genesis.
He makes the case that the god Elohim of Genesis 1 was modeled directly on Plato's supreme,eternal monotheistic god of creation,the demiurge,or craftsman,and indeed that the later monotheism of the Jews and Christians originated with Plato's Tamaeus.
But what of the second creation account of Genesis 2 through 3?The story of Yahweh and Adam and Eve.Gamerican's new book points out that Plato's Tamaeus actually had two creation accounts.You see,Plato had a problem.
A big problem.His monotheistic philosopher's god was perfect and eternal,and everything he created was also perfect and eternal.But humans are profoundly not perfect,flawed and tragically mortal.How could a perfect eternal god create mortal man?
And wouldn't this make God responsible for human wickedness?Plato's solution was brilliant.First,Plato made the supreme monotheistic god of creation,the ancestor of all the traditional gods and goddesses of Greek myth.
In doing so,he endorsed Hesiod's Theogony,that traced the genealogies of the Greek gods,starting with chaos,heaven and earth,except that now the original ancestor was the demiurge,or craftsman of creation.
Second,Plato had the eternal god of creation,delegate the task of creating life,including humanity to all his sons and daughters.In a scene that introduces a strong element of the story of myth,Plato had the craftsman gather his sons and daughters around him and instructed them on how to make humans out of the material elements.
And plant a soul in them,making them a mixture of the material and the divine.After creating humans and other living creatures,the gods were then put in charge of the earth and of humankind,while the monotheistic god of creation retired from the scene,leaving the world to be ruled by his sons and daughters.
According to Russell Gamerkin,this is exactly what we see in Genesis 2-3,where Yahweh,a local terrestrial god,one of many of the sons of god mentioned in early Genesis,ruling his little corner of the world,the land of Eden.
Already in Genesis 1-26,we see the gods plural,making humans in their image,male and female.The gods of Genesis,it seems,also included goddesses among their distinguished ranks.
Why would it say,made in their image,male and female,if both were not creating on the scene.
We later also see multiple gods mentioned in Genesis 2-3,in the sons of god,who married the daughters of men in Genesis 6,and in the story of the tower of Babel in Genesis 11.
We thus see an endorsement of benevolent polytheism in Genesis 1-11,where multiple sons of god are living across the entire face of the earth,all of them good,but none of them the equal of the supreme eternal god of creation.
Under this new model for understanding Genesis,Yahweh is not to be identified with the creator god Elohim of Genesis 1,but is one of the many minor terrestrial gods dwelling on earth,something also seen in the Exodus story,which acknowledges other gods ruling Egypt,Mohab,and other nations,but claims Yahweh as the special god appointed over the
Israelites,but there are no Israelites in the pre-flood world,and Yahweh is instead portrayed as the god of Eden,the ruler of the descendants of Adam and Eve.Yahweh was the son of the most high appointed over Jacob.
Later,in my Genesis 10-11 video,we will mention the 70 nations of Genesis 10,and the 70 angels over the nations in the book of Enoch,one angel or god per nation.
Fun fact,the Greek god Prometheus reminds us in many ways of Yahweh in Genesis 2-3,and that both are pictured creating mankind out of clay.Permetheus was the titan god of forethought and crafty council,who was given the task of molding mankind out of clay.
Permetheus was the titan god of forethought and crafty council,who was given the task of molding mankind out of clay.Some accounts have Prometheus and Athena molding images out of clay,and ordered the winds to breathe into them,and to quicken them.Sounds like the breathing into the clay in Genesis 2-3.
The attempts by Prometheus to better the lives of his creation brought him into conflict with Zeus.Firstly,he tricked the gods out of the best portion of the sacrificial feast,quiring the meat for the feasting of man.
Then when Zeus withheld fire,he stole it from heaven and delivered it to mortal kind hidden inside a finale stock.As punishment for these rebellious acts, Zeus ordered the creation of Pandora,the first woman,as a means to deliver misfortune into the house of man,or as a way to cheat mankind of the company of the good spirits.
Sounds kind of like Adam,blaming Yahweh for making woman once they ate the fruit.Permetheus meanwhile was arrested and bound to a stake on Mount Caucasus,where an eagle was set to feed upon his ever-regenerating liver,or some say heart.Generations later,the hero,that great one,Heracles came along and released the old titan from his torture.
Permetheus was loosely identified in cult and myth with the fire god Hephaestus and the giant Titius.
The Book of the Generations of Heaven and Earth
Yahweh,one of the many sons of the creator Elohim,but not Elohim himself.This picture is totally in line with Greek mythology,with Hesiod,tracing the theogony or genealogy of the gods,starting with the primordial god Chaos and his offspring,the heavens and earth.
Uranos and Gaia,and their various descendants.Pledo endorsed this same traditional Greek family tree,starting with Uranos and Gaia,except that he made them the offspring of the creator of craftsmen.
Therefore,let the generation of these gods be stated by us,following their account,in this wise,of Gaia and Uranos were born the children Oceanos and Titius,and of these,Forkus and Cronos,Reia and all that go with them,and of Cronos and Reia were born Zeus and Hera,and all those who are,as we know,called their brethren,and of these again,other disciples.
In truth,at first,Chaos came to be,but next wide bosomed earth,the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus,and dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide-pathed earth.An earth first bore starry heaven,equal to herself,to cover her on every side,and to be an ever-bosomed earth.
And ever-sure abiding place for the blessed gods,Hesiod,Theogony,116-128.
And as Gamirkin points out,Genesis 2.4 also has its own Theogony,or genealogy of the gods.Genesis 2.4,mazeretic text.
These are the generations of heaven and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.Genesis 2.4,ceptuogen.
This is the book of the origin of heaven and earth.Literally,the book of the Genesis of Oronos and Gaia,when it originated in the day God made the heaven and the earth.
Here we have the title of a new section in Genesis,the generations of the heavens and the earth,mazeretic text,or the book of the Genesis of Oronos and Gaia,ceptuogen.
Similar to later sections in Genesis,with titles such as the generations of Adam,or Noah,or Shem,or Isaac,but in this case,we have the generations of the heavens and earth,just like in Hesiod,and Plato's Timaeus,a family history of the gods.
It may be significant that in various ancient extra biblical traditions,El Elian,the Canaanite Most High God,was also the ancestor of the heavens and earth.
Gaia and Night,in fragment of the Phoenician history of Philo of Biblos,was quoted at Eusebius,preparation for the gospels,1.10.15,Elian,that is Elian,was said to have been the father of Oronos and Gaia,who in turn had many other offspring.
Gaiawai then is not the creator,but one of the many lesser sons of God.Gaiawai points out that in the story of Genesis 2-3,Gaiawai appears in a very limited role,not as cosmic creator,but as a terrestrial God who fashions animals,plants,and humans,like the sons and gods.
In exactly like Plato's Timaeus,Genesis 2-3 is profoundly concerned with the questions of human wickedness and mortality.
According to Gamerican,it seems evident that theGaiawai in the story of the Garden of Eden is a lesser order of God.Gaiawai lives,not in the eternal realm,beyond the heavens,but in the earthly land of Eden.
He dwells in this earthly paradise among the humans he created,much like the Greek gods dwelled on earth in various Greek mythical accounts.
He strolls in the garden planted for his enjoyment,smelling the fragrant breezes in the cool of the day,an almost human picture of pleasure and contentment,and far from omnipotent.
He is surprised to find that Adam and Eve are hiding from him.He calls to them,and finds they were suddenly embarrassed at their nakedness.
He asks,and after a lengthy interrogation,Gaiawai learns about the serpent,and that Adam and Eve have eaten from the forbidden tree of knowledge of good and evil.
One sees virtually the same scene repeated later on,when Cain has murdered Abel,Gaiawai grills Cain,peppering him with questions,where is Abel?What have you done to him?
Gaiawai is neither an all-knowing nor all-powerful cosmic god.In fact,Gaiawai is only one step above being a poor,fallible human himself,different in only one respect,his immortality.
Thus,Gaiawai tells his fellow gods,they must evict Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden.
For behold,the man has become like one of us,knowing good and evil,and now lest he put forth his hand,and take also from the tree of life,and eat and live forever.
Gaiawai decides the man must be driven from the garden,and guards posted to keep him forever outside.
This same theme,the jealousy of the gods,is found in Tamaeus 41c,where the creator says he cannot create humans himself.
For if by my doing these creatures came into existence and partook of life,they would be made equal unto gods,in order therefore that they may be mortal.
His sons and daughters were charged with fashioning these living creatures.Gaiawai points out many other parallels between Genesis 2-3 and Plato's various writings.
According to Plato's statesmen,the first humans had no need of clothes,and were able to converse with animals.
In this same platonic text,the earth spontaneously produced food for the first humans,allowing them to lead idyllic lives free from toil,pain,or disease,until god later became displeased with them.
In Tamaeus,Plato likened sex to the fruit of a tree,which humans have an insatiable appetite for.
And in Protagoras,Plato said that humans,even though they possessed a full knowledge of good and evil,Plato's exact words could still be tempted to bad deeds by their appetites,passions,and the enticement of the senses,just like in Genesis.
These and other platonic themes appear throughout Genesis 2-3,for Gamerican,this points to the late date and long ignored Greek influence on the biblical text.
Plato's Tamaeus,his famous dialogue on the origins of the universe and human life,provides the key to finally unlocking the mysteries of the biblical stories of creation.
