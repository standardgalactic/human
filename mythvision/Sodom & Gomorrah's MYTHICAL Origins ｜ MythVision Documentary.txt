If Genesis were a scholarly tome,
the myth of Lot would be a fascinating footnote,
a delightful digression from the main narrative,
drawing inspiration from the earlier tales of Noah.
This narrative offers a fiery reboot,
perhaps in response to God's vow
to abstain from aquatic annihilation.
Could it be that Lot's very existence in this tale
serves as an etiological explanation
for the origins of the Moabites and Ammonites?
Nations later portrayed as adversaries of the Israelites?
While Abraham heeds God's call to venture
into unknown territories,
he curiously brings along his nephew Lot.
Abraham's journey underscores the virtue
of unwavering faith in divine decrees,
even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds.
In this exposition, I aim to elucidate
the mythical nature of Lot's tale,
which by extension encompasses Abraham,
drawing parallels with other ancient myths
featuring divine visitations and cataclysmic destructions.
I hope to illuminate the allegorical essence
of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
By the video's conclusion, I trust you'll appreciate
the narrative artistry of this ancient tale.
Now let's delve deep into the enigma
that is Lot's legacy.
Lot's role.
The story of Lot, Abraham's nephew,
sheds light on Israel's early history.
When God calls Abraham to leave his homeland
and go to Canaan, Abraham takes Lot along,
even though God told Abraham to leave his relatives behind.
This hints that Abraham doubts God's promise
to give him many descendants,
since his wife, Sarah, is unable to have children.
Bringing Lot seems like a backup plan.
Once in Canaan, Abraham and Lot become rich
and their herdsmen start fighting over land.
Abraham generously lets Lot choose which land he wants.
Lot picks the fertile Jordan Valley outside of Canaan.
This suggests Lot could be Abraham's heir,
but God then promises Abraham the land will go
to his offspring, not Lot's.
Later, Lot gets captured in a raid on Sodom where he lives.
Abraham risks his life to save Lot.
This wouldn't have been necessary
if Abraham had obeyed God and left Lot behind.
Before destroying Sodom for its wickedness,
God discusses it with Abraham.
Knowing Abraham's nephew lives there,
Abraham persuades God not to sweep away
the righteous with the wicked,
but he can't mention Lot's name
without admitting his earlier disobedience.
In the end, God spares Lot because of Abraham,
not due to Abraham's argument.
After Sodom's destruction,
Lot's daughters get him drunk
and trick him into fathering their children,
afraid they are the last survivors.
This leads to Israel's enemies Moab and Ammon being born.
So while Lot was righteous in Sodom,
his presence in Canaan due to Abraham's disobedience
led to future conflict for Abraham's descendants.
The story contrasts Abraham's heir
coming through God's promise
and Lot's heirs coming through deceit.
This is a general recap of Lot
from the Anchor Bible Dictionary.
But what I found missing was the comparative myth
of theoxany in this scholarly work.
What is theoxany, you say?
Theoxany, or theoxenia, is a theme in Greek mythology
in which human beings demonstrate their virtue or piety
by extending hospitality to a humble stranger, Sinos,
who turns out to be disguised as a deity, Theos,
with the capacity to bestow rewards.
In the scholarly realm of mythology and ritual,
theoxany refers to the gracious hosting of deities
by mere mortals, often over a sumptuous feast.
Homer's epics depict God's mingling at sacrifices
and in the Odyssey, they even traverse the earth incognito,
assessing the ethical fiber of humanity.
This narrative seed blossoms
into the quintessential theoxany tale.
A deity either welcomed or spurned
later reveals their divine identity
and bestows blessings or retributions accordingly.
The tragic tale of Penteas
exemplifies the consequences of a botched theoxinic encounter
while triumphant instances underpin the origins
of numerous cults, notably those of Demeter and Dionysus.
Within these tales, the mortal host often ascends
to heroic status, having been enlightened by the God
and subsequently inaugurating the cult
or pioneering innovations like viticulture,
which is harvesting and cultivating grapes.
The Homeric hymn to Demeter recounts
Demeter's reception at Eleusis,
a tale tinged with both triumph and tribulation.
Yet the most iconic rendition of this motif
likely rooted in local lore is the poignant tale
of Bacchus and Philemon.
I see lots of Greek stories using the theoxany motif,
but a far older account in Mesopotamia
with elements of theoxany is the poor man of Nippur.
It's an Akkadian story dating from around 1500 BCE.
It is attested by only three texts,
only one of which is more than a small fragment.
What I'm suggesting is that these mythical elements
of divine visitors among mortals
who treat strangers hospitable or disrespectful
spans back to the earliest civilizations with writing.
However, none of these extremely ancient narratives
looks remotely close to the comparisons made
between the Bible and the Greek myths.
I wanna turn our attention to two fascinating myths
documented by Ovid, Pubulus Ovidius Nasso,
21st of March, 43 BC to 80, 17 or 18 is his life.
He was a Roman poet who lived during the reign
of Caesar Augustus.
Let's take a look at these two stories written by Ovid,
one in his metamorphosis and the other in his fasty.
Transformations or metamorphosis is a long poem
written in eight CE by the famous Roman writer Ovid.
Many consider it his best work.
It tells the story of the world from the very beginning
to when Julius Caesar became a God using over 250 legends.
It's a big poem with 15 parts and almost 12,000 lines.
While it feels like an epic tale,
it's unique because it changes its mood and topics a lot.
Ovid was inspired by other stories about transformations
but he added his own twist to them.
Let's dive into Ovid's stories and the Bible,
compare them and chat about what we find.
Bacchus and Philemon.
And at this point, the river said no more.
This wonderful event astonished all,
but one was there, Ixian's hauntie son,
a known despiser of the living gods
who laughing scorned it as an idle tale.
He made a jest of those who heard
and said, a foolish fiction,
Echulus, how can such a tale be true?
Do you believe a God there is in heaven so powerful?
A God to give and take away a form,
transform, created shapes?
Such impious words found no response
in those who heard him speak.
Amazed, he could so doubt known truth before them all.
Up rose to vindicate the gods.
The hero Lelix, wise in length of days,
the glory of the living gods, he said,
is not diminished nor their power confined
and whatsoever they decree is done.
And I have this to tell,
for all must know the evil of such words.
Upon the hills of Phrygia, I have seen two sacred trees,
a lime tree and an oak.
So closely grown their branches interlace,
a low stone wall is built around
to guard them from all harm.
And that you may not doubt it.
I declare again, I saw the spot for Pythias.
There he sent me to attend his father's court.
Near by those trees are stagnant pools and fins,
where coots and comarats delight to hunt.
But it was not so always.
Long ago, T'was visited by mighty Jupiter,
together with his nimble-witted son,
who first had laid aside his rod and wings.
As weary travelers over all the land,
they wandered begging for their food and bed.
And for a thousand houses, all the doors were bolted
and no word of kindness given.
So wicked were the people of that land.
At last by chance, they stopped at a small house,
whose humble roof was thatched with reeds and straw,
and here a kind old couple greeted them.
The good Dame Bacchus seemed about the age
of old Philemon, her devoted man.
They had been married in their early youth,
in that same cottage and had lived in it,
and grown together to a good old age,
contented with their lot,
because they knew their property and felt no shame of it.
They had no need of servants.
The good pair were masters of their home
and served themselves, their own commands they easily obeyed.
Now, when the two gods, Joven Mercury,
had reached their cottage,
and with bending necks had entered the low door,
the old man bade them rest their weary limbs
and set a bench on which his good wife Bacchus
threw a cloth.
And then with kindly bustle,
she stirred up the glowing embers on the hearth
and then laid tender, leaves and bark,
and bending down, breathed on them with her ancient breath
until they kindled into flame.
Then from the house, she brought a bundle of sticks
and small twigs and broken branches,
and above them swung a kettle,
not too large for simple folk.
And all this done, she stripped some cabbage leaves,
which her good husband gathered for the meal.
Then with a two-pronged fork,
the man let down a rusty side of bacon from a loft
and cut a little portion from the chine,
which had been cherished long.
He softened it in boiling water.
All the while, they tried with cheerful conversation
to beguile, so none might notice a brief loss of time.
Swung on a peg, they had a beechwood trough,
which quickly with warm water filled,
was used for comfortable washing,
and they fixed up a willow couch,
cushioned soft of springy sedge,
on which they neatly spread a well-worn cloth,
preserved so many years.
Twas only used on rare and festive days,
and even it was coarse and very old,
though not unfit to match a willow couch.
Now, as the gods reclined,
the good old dame whose skirts were tucked up,
moving carefully, for so she tottered with her many years,
fetched a clean table for the ready meal,
but one leg of the table was too short,
and so she wedged it with a potchard.
So, made firm, she cleanly scoured it with fresh mint,
and here is set the double-tinted fruit of chased Minerva,
and the tasty dish of corner, autumn picked and pickled.
These were served for relish,
and the endive green and radishes
surrounding a large pot of curdled milk,
and eggs not overdone,
but gently turned in glowing embers.
All served up in earthen dishes,
then sweet wine served up in clay, so costly,
all embossed and cups of beechwood smoothed with yellow wax.
So now they had short respite
till the fire might yield the heated course.
Again, they served new wine, but mellow.
In a second course, sweet nuts, dried figs,
and wrinkled dates and plums,
and apples fragrant in wide baskets heaped,
and in a wreath of grapes from purple vines,
concealed almost a glistening honeycomb,
and all these orchard dainties were enhanced
by willing service and congenial smiles.
But while they served, the wine bowl often drained
as often was replenished,
though unfilled and Bacchus and Philemon full of fear,
as they observed the wine spontaneous well,
increasing when it should diminish,
raised their hands in supplication,
and implored indulgence for their simple home and fare,
and now persuaded by this strange event
such visitors were deities unknown.
This aged couple, anxious to bestow
their most esteemed possession,
hastily began to chase the only goose they had,
the faithful guardian of their little home,
which they would kill and offer to the gods.
But swift of wing, at last it wearied them,
and fled for refuge to the smiling gods.
At once the deities forbade their zeal
and said, a righteous punishment shall fall severe
upon this wicked neighborhood.
But by the might of our divinity,
no evil shall befall this humble home.
But you must come and follow as we climb the summit
of this mountain.
Both obeyed and leaning on their staves,
toiled up the steep, not farther from the summit
than the flight.
Of one swift arrow from a hunter's howl,
they paused to view their little home once more,
and as they turned their eyes,
they saw the fields around their own engulfed in a morass.
Although their own remained,
and while they wept bewelling,
the sad fate of many friends,
and wondering at the change they saw their home,
so old and little for their simple need,
put on new splendor, and as it increased,
it changed into a temple of the gods.
Where first the frame was fashioned
of rude stakes, columns of marble glistened,
and the thatch gleamed golden in the sun,
and legends carved adorn the doors,
and all the ground shone white with marble rich,
and after this was done,
the son of Saturn said with gentle voice,
now tell us, good old man,
and you, his wife, worthy and faithful,
what is your desire?
Philemon counseled with old Bacchus first,
and then discovered to the listening gods
their heart's desire.
We pray you let us have the care of your new temple,
and since we have passed so many years in harmony,
let us depart this life together,
let the same hour take us both.
I would not see the tomb of my dear wife,
and let me not be destined to be buried by her hands.
At once their wishes were fulfilled.
So long as life was granted,
they were known to be the temple's trusted keepers,
and when age had innervated them with many years,
as they were standing by some chance
before the sacred steps,
and were relating all these things as they had happened,
Bacchus saw Philemon her husband,
and he too saw Bacchus as their bodies put forth leaves,
and while the tops of trees grew over them,
above their faces, they spoke each to each.
As long as they could speak, they said farewell,
farewell my own, and while they said farewell,
new leaves and branches cover both at once.
The people of Tyana still point out two trees,
which grew there from a double trunk,
two forms made into one.
Old truthful men who have no reason to deceive me,
told me truly all that I have told you,
and I have seen the votive wreaths hung
from the branches of the hallowed double tree,
and one time as I hung the fresh garlands there,
I said those whom the gods care for are gods,
and those who worshiped are now worshiped here.
Ovid's Metamorphosis, book eight, six, 12.
Now we are turning to Ovid's Fasti,
which highlights another significant portion
to the puzzle of Genesis.
The calendar, or Fasti, is a poem
by the famous Roman writer Ovid
from around 8 AD.
It's like a diary that talks about Roman holidays
and their stories.
Ovid couldn't finish it because he got in trouble
with Emperor Augustus and was sent away.
In the poem, Ovid acts like a reporter
speaking to eyewitnesses, who are chatting with Roman gods
to find out the cool tales behind the holidays.
Sometimes there's more than one story for a holiday.
Hierius and the Birth of Orion in May.
All the same, these three festivals occur
about the same time, but not in succession
on any intervening day.
If in the middle of them you look for Boeotian Orion,
you'll get it wrong.
I must sing the reason for that constellation.
Jupiter and his brother, who is king in the wide ocean
and Mercury, were traveling the roads together.
It was the time when upturned plows are brought back
by the yoked oxen and the lamb.
Head down, drinks the milk of the well-filled you.
By chance, an old man, Hierius, farmer of a narrow plot,
sees them as he was standing in front of his little cottage.
And this is what he said, the way is long,
but there isn't a long time left
and my door is open for strangers.
He added a look to his words and asked a second time.
They go along with his promises
and do not reveal that they are gods.
They pass under the old man's roof,
soiled with black smoke, with his breath
and brings out battered torches and chops them up.
There are pots standing, the smaller held beans,
the other herbs and each froths,
closely covered by its lid.
And while they wait, he gives red wine
with a trembling hand.
The god of ocean receives the first cup.
As soon as he drained it, he said,
now let the next to drink be Jupiter.
The old man heard Jupiter and went white.
When his wits have returned,
he sacrifices the ox that tilled his poor field
and roasts it on a great fire.
And the wine he had once laid up
as a boy in early years he brings out,
stored in a smoky jar.
No delay, they reclined on couches
that concealed river sedge in linen,
but were not high even so.
The table gleamed, now with a feast,
now with leis set there.
The bowl was red earthenware, the cups were beach.
Jupiter's words were,
if anything occurs to you, wish for it.
You'll gain it all.
The mild man's words were,
I had a dear wife known to me
in the spring of first youth.
You ask where she is now.
The urn covers her.
To her, I swore an oath,
having called you to witness my words.
You alone, I said, will be married to me.
I said it and I keep my word.
But in fact, I have a different wish.
I don't wanna be a husband
and I do wanna be a father.
They had all nodded agreement.
They had all stood by the hide of the ox.
I'm ashamed to speak further.
Then they covered the dripping hide
by throwing earth on top.
And now 10 months and a boy had been born.
Hierius calls him Urian,
because that's how he was conceived.
The first letter has lost its ancient sound.
He had grown immensely.
Delia took him as her companion.
He was the guard of the goddess.
He was her escort.
Unthinking words moved the gods anger.
The wild beast I can't overcome, he said, doesn't exist.
Earth sent in a scorpion.
Its intent was to bring its crooked barbs
against the goddess, mother of twins.
Orion stood in its way.
Latona added him to the shining stars
and said, have the reward of what you deserve.
Ovid, fasty, 495 to 540.
Oxford, world's classic.
Now let's turn to Genesis.
See if anything stands out.
The three visitors, Genesis 18.
The Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre
while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent
in the heat of the day.
Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby.
When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent
to meet them and bowed low to the earth.
He said, if I have found favor in your eyes, my Lord,
do not pass your servant by.
Let a little water be brought
and then you may all wash your feet
and rest under this tree.
Let me get you something to eat
so you can be refreshed and then go on your way.
Now that you have come to your servant very well,
they answered, do as you say.
So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah.
Quick, he said, get three saiyas of our finest flour
and knead it and bake some bread.
Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice,
tender calf and gave it to a servant
who hurried to prepare it.
He then brought some curds and milk
and the calf that had been prepared
and set these before them.
While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
Where is your wife, Sarah?
They asked him.
There in the tent, he said.
Then one of them said, I will surely return to you
about this time next year
and Sarah, your wife, will have a son.
Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent,
which was behind him.
Abraham and Sarah were already very old
and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought,
after I am worn out and my Lord is old,
will I now have this pleasure?
Then the Lord said to Abraham, why did Sarah laugh
and say, will I really have a child now that I am old?
Is anything too hard for the Lord?
I will return to you at the appointed time next year
and Sarah will have a son.
Sarah was afraid.
So she lied and said, I did not laugh.
But he said, yes, you did laugh.
When the men got up to leave,
they looked down towards Sodom
and Abraham walked along with them
to see them on their way.
Then the Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham
what I am about to do?
Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation
and all the nations on earth will be blessed through him.
For I have chosen him so that he will direct his children
and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord
by doing what is right and just.
So that the Lord will bring about for Abraham
what he has promised him.
Then the Lord said, the outcry against Sodom
and Gomorrah so great and their sins so grievous
that I will go down and see if what they have done
is as bad as the outcry that has reached me.
If not, I will know.
The men turned away and went towards Sodom.
But Abraham remained standing before the Lord.
Then Abraham approached him and said,
will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
What if there are 50 righteous people in the city?
Will you really sweep it away
and not spare the place for the sake
of 50 righteous people in it?
Far be it from you to do such a thing
to kill the righteous with the wicked,
treating the righteous and the wicked alike.
Far be it from you.
Will not the judge of all the earth do right?
The Lord said, if I find 50 righteous people
in the city of Sodom,
I will spare the whole place for their sake.
Then Abraham spoke up again.
Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord,
though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
what if the number of the righteous is five less than 50?
Will you destroy the whole city for the lack of five people?
If I find 45 there, he said, I will not destroy it.
Once again, he spoke to him.
What if only 40 are found there?
He said, for the sake of 40, I will not do it.
Then he said, may the Lord not be angry, but let me speak.
What if only 30 can be found there?
He answered, I will not do it if I find 30 there.
Abraham said, now that I have been so bold
as to speak to the Lord,
what if only 20 can be found there?
He said, for the sake of 20, I will not destroy it.
Then he said, may the Lord not be angry,
but let me speak just once more.
What if only 10 can be found there?
He answered, for the sake of 10,
I will not destroy it.
When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham,
he left and Abraham returned home.
Two visitors, Genesis 19.
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening
and Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom.
When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them
and bowed down with his face to the ground.
He said, please, my Lords,
turn aside to your servant's house and spin the night
and wash your feet.
Then you can rise early and go on your way.
They said, no, we will spin the night in the square,
but he urged them strongly,
so they turned aside to him and entered his house.
And he made them a feast
and baked unleavened bread and they ate.
Then the men said to Lot, have you anyone else here,
sons-in-law, sons, daughters,
or anyone you have in the city?
Bring them out of the place,
for we are about to destroy this place
because the outcry against its people
has become great before the Lord.
And the Lord has sent us to destroy it.
So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-laws,
who were to marry his daughters up, get out of this place,
for the Lord is about to destroy the city,
but he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
When morning dawned and the angels urged Lot,
saying, get up, take your wife and your two daughters,
who are here or else you will be consumed
in the punishment of the city.
But he lingered, so the men seized him
and his wife and his two daughters by the hand.
The Lord being merciful to him
and they brought him out and left him outside the city.
When they had brought them outside,
they said, flee for your life.
Do not look back or stop anywhere in the plain,
flee to the hills or else you will be consumed.
Genesis 19, the stories are extremely close.
Two angels, Genesis with Lot, or two gods,
Ovid's Metamorphosis.
The two were three in both previous stories,
Abraham's Three Visitors and Hyresis, Three Visitors.
Come to visit a city in the guise of humans
and a pious man offers them hospitality.
In Ovid's version, the details of the mill are described.
The angels or gods reveal themselves
and explain how, due to its inhabitants,
the city will be destroyed,
but that the pious couple will be spared
and allowed to flee with them.
In Genesis, the inhabitants of Sodom act perversely.
They want to, quote, know the guests of Lot,
meaning they wanna rape them.
Here, the descendants of Canaan
are accused of inhospitality,
Lot is ready to give them his own virgin daughters.
We must keep in mind these details of Genesis 19,
for they appear again in the story of Gibeah in Judges 19.
Lot negotiates with the angels
to allow him to find refuge in Zohar.
His sons and Laws from Sodom refuse to follow him.
God destroys the city with fire,
whereas the Roman story speaks of a flood.
Philemon and Bacchus will become the keepers of a temple
and eventually in their lives
by merging together into a tree.
The rest of Genesis 19 shows more parallels with Ovid.
For example, Lot and his family are ordered to refrain
from looking back at Sodom as they flee,
also seen in the well-known story of Orpheus and Eurydice.
They took the upward path through the still silence,
steep and dark, shadowy with dense fog,
drawing near to the threshold of the upper world,
afraid she was no longer there and eager to see her.
The lover turned his eyes.
In an instant, she dropped back and he, unhappy man,
stretching out his arms to hold her and be held,
clutched at nothing but the receding air,
dying a second time.
Now, there was no complaint to her husband.
What then could she complain of,
except that she had been loved?
She spoke at last, farewell,
that now scarcely reached his ears
and turned again towards that same place.
Ovid, Metamorphosis Book 10, also see Virgil.
Then the Lord reigned on Sodom and Gomorrah,
sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
And he overthrew those cities and all the plain
and all the inhabitants of the cities
and what grew on the ground.
But Lot's wife behind him looked back.
She became a pillar of salt, Genesis 19.
The motif of a woman who was lost
because either she or her companion looked back
is found in both the Bible and Ovid.
The last episode of Lot's story
is his act of incest with his two daughters.
They made him drunk and slept with him alternatively.
The first daughter gave birth to Moab,
ancestor of the Moabites.
The second daughter gave birth to Benami,
ancestor of the Ammonites in Genesis 19.
A very similar story is again found in Ovid's Metamorphosis.
Myra, daughter of King Sinaris of Cyprus,
had fallen in love with her father.
As she could not repress these feelings,
she confessed them to her nurse
and the two of them plotted to inebriate him
to the extent that he would not recognize the woman
with whom he was going to lie.
Myra slept with her father 12 nights in a row.
Yet on the last night, he discovered her identity
and wanted to kill her.
She fled and transformed, had a metamorphosis,
into a myrtree, later giving birth to the God Adonis,
Ovid Metamorphosis Buktin.
In Ovid's Metamorphosis Buktin,
the tales of Orpheus and Myra are intriguingly sequenced
similarly to the biblical counterparts,
albeit interspersed with unrelated narratives.
In Genesis 18 and 19,
while three angels are initially mentioned,
only two venture to Sodom, mirroring Ovid's depiction
where of the three gods at Orion's birth,
Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury,
only Jupiter and Mercury visit Philemon and Bacchus' city.
The narrative of Lot parallels Philemon and Bacchus
until their city exit.
While the latter duo finds safety,
Lot's wife faces a tragic fate,
reminiscent of Eurydice and Lot's daughters,
actions echo Myra's.
These parallels suggest a shared origin,
possibly from the Hellenistic period.
Some posit Ovid's influence might stem
from Nicander of Caliphon, though his works are lost.
Most classicists suggest that Ovid is inspired
by the works of Calamacus.
I think it's necessary we highlight this man for a moment.
Calamacus, circa 310 to 240 BCE,
was an ancient Greek poet, scholar and librarian
who was active in Alexandria during the third century BCE.
A representative of ancient Greek literature
of the Hellenistic period,
he wrote over 800 literary works
in a wide variety of genres, most of which did not survive.
He espoused an aesthetic philosophy
known as Calamachianism,
which exerted a strong influence
on the poets of the Roman Empire
and through them on all subsequent Western literature.
He came under the patronage of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus
and was employed at the Library of Alexandria
where he compiled the pinnakes,
a comprehensive catalog of all Greek literature.
He was writing around the same time the Septuagint
was created according to the letter of Aristius
to Philocrates, which is a Hellenistic work
of the third or early second century BCE,
considered by some biblical scholars to be pseudopigraphal.
The letter is the earliest text to mention
the Library of Alexandria.
Josephus, who paraphrases about two-fifths of the letter,
ascribes it to Aristius of Marmara
and to have been written to a certain Philocrates.
The letter describes the Greek translation
of the Hebrew Bible by 72 interpreters
sent into Egypt from Jerusalem
at the request of the Librarian of Alexandria,
resulting in the Septuagint translation.
Some scholars have since argued that it is fictitious.
Could Calomacus or some Greek authors
influenced these Bible authors
who put final touches on these Genesis narratives?
These classicists also recognize
that the Philemon and Bacchus story in Ovid
reflects elements of the Calomacus narratives
of Heckel and Aetia.
It seems rather obvious that Ovid
didn't lift his tales from the Bible,
but the overlaps in comparisons
are so strikingly similar that one has to wonder
are they working off a common source
or did the Bible authors find inspiration
of the stories from the Greeks
to craft their Genesis, Abraham,
and La Theopsinian Theophany?
Some scholars suggest that the Ovid story mentions Phrygia
as the location of the Philemon and Bacchus myth.
Could it be possible that stories
from the Old Testament were familiar
in Hellenistic Phrygia and influenced local folktales?
Historical records from Josephus indicate
that Antiochus III, around 242 to 187 BC,
relocated 2,000 Jewish families from Mesopotamia
and Babylonia to regions like Lydia and Phrygia.
Notably, the telephilemon Bacchus
is set in Lydia's core region,
while some question the authenticity
of Antiochus's letter as presented by Josephus.
Ensuring the Jewish settlers their rights and traditions,
it's undeniable that these Jewish communities
were established in Lydia and Phrygia
during Antiochus's reign.
Their significant numbers suggest
they were likely influential in their new surroundings.
It's also very likely that this Phrygian tale
made a big impact on the Jewish communities
and they incorporated it into their Genesis myth.
Scholars have largely overlooked the similarities
between the Philemon Bacchus narrative
and certain Old Testament stories.
While Hollis is a particular scholar on this,
provides a comprehensive analysis
of the Philemon Bacchus background,
he briefly touches upon potential
Jewish influences on the tale.
Galinsky vaguely notes the connection
between the Philemon Bacchus story
and some biblical themes,
attributing it to the inherent religious nature of the myth.
However, a few have been more direct in their observations.
A scholar named H.T. Reilly draws a parallel
between the fate of Philemon Bacchus's inhospitable neighbors
and the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction.
He also suggests that the hospitality
shown by Philemon Bacchus to Jupiter and Mercury
might be inspired by Abraham's reception of the angels.
Franz Bomer hints at possible Jewish influences
on the Philemon Bacchus story,
but overlooks C.C. Bushnell's article
that details the links with Genesis 18 to 19.
To summarize, there are notable parallels
between the Philemon Bacchus narrative
and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible.
Here's a graph that I'm showing you on the screen
that it gives a good visual representation
of these parallels between Genesis 18 and 19

There's a strange story in Judges 19
which carries similarities to Genesis 19
as highlighted by Paul Davidson.
Davidson wonders if Genesis 19
combined the Hellenistic theophany concepts
but ultimately sees one of these counts as copying the other.
Look at this graph again.
Judges 19 with Gebia.
The visitors to Sodom intend to spend the night in the square.
A Levite traveling with his concubine
prepares to spend a night in the square in Gebia.
Lot, a foreigner residing in Sodom, puts them up in his house.
An old man, a foreigner residing in Gebia,
puts the Levite and his concubine up in his house.
A violent mob consisting of all the city's men
surrounded the house and demand that the visitors be handed over
so that we might know them.
A violent mob of the city's men surrounded the house
and demands that the Levite be handed over
so that we might know him.
Lot offers to hand over his virgin daughters instead.
The master of the house offers to hand over his virgin daughter
and the Levite's concubine instead.
The mob refuses. The mob refuses.
There's no parallel to the Genesis account
but the Judges one says the Levite's concubine is handed over to the mob
and she's raped and killed.
Notice both the story in Genesis 19 and the Telophilmon Bacchus
share themes of divine judgment
and they both echo ancient flood stories from the Near East.
For instance, in the Sodom story from Genesis 19
there are hints that link it to flood tales.
Number one, the word rain is used when describing
how God sent down fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah.
Two, people are told to escape to the hills
which makes sense if you're trying to avoid rising waters.
Number three, the city of Sodom and Gomorrah
are said to be near the Dead Sea, a significant body of water.
So these stories aren't just about punishment.
They're also connected to ancient tales of massive floods.
Many cultures have tales of massive floods.
In the Bible there's Noah's Ark
and in the Greek stories there's the tale of Dukallion and Pira.
Interestingly, the famous ancient Greek writer Hesiod
didn't mention the flood story.
Some think he might have not even known about it
while others believe he chose to leave it out.
M.L. West suggests that this flood story
actually came from the east
and was adapted to fit the Greek setting.
So just like the story of Noah
was reimagined in Greece with Dukallion
as the central figure,
the tale of Philemon and Bacchus and Phrygia
could have borrowed elements
from the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Both these tales talk about localized floods,
making them a sort of spin-off
from the bigger, more universal flood stories
like Noah's and Dukallion's.
I want to highlight that Ovid's major flood narrative
is the Dukallion and Pira stories in Book 1 of Ovid.
In this cataclysmic flood account,
these husband and wife recount that if one of them
were to be swallowed up by the flood waters,
the other would follow them to death.
How would you feel now, poor soul,
if the fates had willed you to be saved but not me?
How could you endure your fear alone?
Who would comfort your tears?
Believe me, dear wife, if the sea had you,
I would follow you and the sea would have me too.
Ovid's Metamorphosis, Book 1.
It's a love story inside of the flood myth
similar to the story of Philemon and Bacchus.
Both stories highlight a temple or sanctuaries
post-Aeluge.
Ovid's Greek genesis has Apollo chase Daphne
in love with her, but she is transformed into a tree.
Help me, Father, if your streams have divine powers,
change me.
Destroy this beauty that pleases too well.
Her prayer was scarcely done when a heavy numbness
seized her limbs, then bark closed over her breasts.
Her hair turned into leafs, her arms into branches,
her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast
in slow-growing roots.
Her face was lost in the canopy,
only her shining beauty was left.
Ovid's Metamorphosis, Book 1.
The same way one would expect the major Dukallion story,
Ovid's Metamorphosis, Book 1,
to be connected to the Philemon and Bacchus flood story
in Book 8 of Ovid,
I suggest the flood of Noah in Genesis 6-9
is connected to the rain of fire catastrophe
in Lot, Genesis 18 and 19.
H.T. Reilly pointed out some interesting similarities
between two stories.
One were Philemon and Bacchus,
hosts God's Jupiter and Mercury,
and another were Abraham and Sarah,
welcomed three angels, as told in Genesis 18.
In both tales, a kind-hearted couple welcomes
mysterious powerful guests,
setting the stage for later events
where the wicked face consequences
and the good hearted are saved.
Here's what the two stories have in common.
One, a loving couple,
not realizing who their guests truly are,
offers them a warm welcome.
Two, both couples are older and don't have kids.
Three, together the husband and wife
whip up a hearty meal for their guests.
Four, both stories have a touch of humor.
There's laughter in the Genesis tale,
while in the other, there's a funny scene with a goose.
Number five, sacred trees play a role in both stories.
In Genesis, the couple meets their guest
by some special trees,
and in the other story, the couple turned into
sacred trees at the end.
Both the story in Genesis 18 and the tale of Bacchus
and Philemon have shared elements,
like washing the guest's feet and offering a meal,
but there are five unique similarities
between the two stories that suggest the Philemon and Bacchus
tale might have been influenced by the Genesis account,
though it could have been the other way around.
Elements from the story in Genesis 18,
where an elderly couple is visited by mysterious guest
and promise a child,
also appear in another tale called Hyraeus Episode.
In this story, an old man named Hyraeus
is also visited by a special guest
and has miraculously promised a son, Orion.
This tale of Orion's birth has been around for a long time.
It can be traced back through Nicander's poetic predecessor
Antimachus of Caliphon, around 425 BCE.
It's unclear when or how the story of Isaac's miraculous birth
from Genesis or the miraculous birth of Orion
influenced the other tale,
but it's interesting to see these similarities.
Dr. Philip Vajambam in his book,
Argonauts of the Desert says it's improbable
that Ovid drew from the Bible
given its shift away from mythological themes.
Conversely, the idea of the Bible
adopting and then sanitizing Greek tales
to align with Platonic ideals seems more plausible.
This adaptation, however, seems limited to divine portrayals,
as the Bible doesn't shy away from human-centric tales,
even if they're violent or shocking.
His entire book is a collection of ideas
which highlight several parallels
to the Greek world from the Bible.
Also, Russell Gomirkin may echo
much of the sentiment of the biblical myths
being inspired by the Greeks,
as well as several Near Eastern myths.
As far as parallels go with the Genesis account in Ovid,
no such parallels are this close
from any other theoxany or theodicy,
meaning we have no other accounts in any written myth
that come close to these stories as listed before.
We can speculate on sources
or speculate on which one was influenced by the other
for whatever reasons one lists.
It should be apparent that the Genesis stories
are in the same category of genre
as these other Greek and Roman sources.
These are not history, but clever stories or myths.
Those who try to act like Genesis is giving us history
are completely blind to the realisms of these other myths.
It's safe to say much of these Greek, biblical,
and Roman myth of theoxany and theodicy
are influenced by Homer's Odyssey and Iliad.
This is not to say other influences were not at play.
In the New Testament, I see strange eclectic borrowing
from the Septuagint or LXX scriptures
and Greek and Roman ideas in Jesus' transfiguration scene.
As mentioned in the Philemon and Baca story,
they end up on a mountain before the god Jupiter, Zeus,
granted them a wish.
That wish was that they would serve the gods forever
and not see their loved ones' death.
This wish was granted.
The New Testament apostles expected immortality from Jesus
and the soon apocalyptic end by fire mentioned by Jesus
and other authors have connections to this transfiguration scene,
which is a preview of Jesus' apotheosis, it seems.
Peter speaks out of the three mortals on that high mountain
about building tabernacles for these three, Jesus, Moses, and Elijah.
It's clear that the authors are modeling the scene off of the Moses story,
but Jesus' clothes experience a metamorphosis.
The other scene I find interesting was when Jupiter, in disguise,
kept replenishing the wine so that they never ran out.
While Dionysus is universally known to have transformed milk into wine
and understood as the god of wine and drunkenness,
this miracle in Ovid's story was the sign Bacchus and Philemon
knew they were entertaining gods.
Hopefully this will give you some context for why Jesus transformed water
into wine per the gospels.
They want you to see him as a god.
This one might be going out on a limb,
but I noticed in the Noah and Locke catastrophes,
both stories highlight how the survivor gets drunk off wine
and some weird family sexual act takes place while they are intoxicated.
I'm reminded of Dionysus in these narratives,
though a demythologized version of a Greek myth.
This characteristic of the mundane, almost euhemerist angle.
Euhemerism is the theory that gods arose out of the deification of historical heroes.
This idea became very influential by Euhemerus,
who lived in the late 4th century BCE,
though the attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms
does have pedigree further back in history.
By St. John the Aethon, Xenophans, Herodotus, Hecateus of Abdera,
and Euphoros of Sime.
The only remaining evidence of anything related to St. John the Aethon,
who wrote around 1200 BCE, is preserved in Eusebius,
who is using Philoabiblos as his source.
Most scholars suggest that Philoabiblos is Hellenizing his sources into Greek,
giving them a rationalizing and euhemeristic slant.
It seems the rationalizing of myths started with the Greeks,
as far as we can assess on the evidence.
This gives scholars who think the Bible borrowed from the Greeks
good reason to think these Genesis narratives are rationalizing
and bringing their highly mythological sources,
Gilgamesh Epic and Numa Elish, Egyptian mythologies,
Odyssey, Iliad, Herodotus, and other sources down to Earth
in a way that gives it a more believable slant,
unlike the Greek and Roman counterparts.
It was Greek philosophers who rationalized their own myths,
and maybe they brushed shoulders with the biblical authors.
Of course, there are several other reasons why these Genesis authors
may have borrowed from the Greeks instead of the other way around,
but that will need to be tackled another day.
Luke 24, A God in Disguise.
Let's turn to a few interesting observations that I've made
about Ovid's stories, Genesis, and the Gospels.
Recent studies suggest that the authors of the Gospels,
the books in the Bible that tell the story of Jesus,
might have started with his sayings and then created stories around them.
They could have pulled inspiration from many places,
but not many people think they looked at ancient Greek stories,
even though these were super popular at the time.
However, the Gospel of Luke seems to be trying to appeal to a wider audience
that would be familiar with these Greek tales.
Some experts, like Bons, think Luke's stories have a lot in common
with Greek epic poems.
Early Christians even saw similarities between their stories and Greek myths.
For example, in one part of the Bible, Paul visits Athens
and talks about these connections.
He talks about, even your own poets have said in Acts 17,
I believe that one part of Luke, which tells a post-resurrection story of Jesus,
is actually inspired by the Greek epic, the Odyssey.
The story has elements of God's visiting humans
and moments of realization, which are common in Greek tales.
It's interesting to note that stories about what happened after Jesus' resurrection
seem to vary a lot.
The earliest account by Paul has details that aren't in the later Gospels.
Luke's version is unique and focuses more on Jesus' followers.
It paints Jesus as a kind of philosopher whose teachings live on through his students,
but there's a twist in Luke's story.
A disciple named Cleopas, who doesn't appear anywhere else in the New Testament,
plays a big role.
He misunderstands Jesus' teachings and needs to be set straight.
This is similar to a theme in Greek stories where a God in disguise
corrects a human about divine matters.
Again, the oxen is a type of ancient story where a God disguises themselves as a stranger
to see how they're treated by humans.
It's a test of kindness and respect.
There are two main types of these stories.
In one, the guests are rude and end up angering the God,
leading to some kind of disaster.
In the other, everyone is nice and things go well.
A famous example of the positive type is the ancient Greek story, the Odyssey.
In it, a character named Nestor and his family are nice to a guest
who turns out to be the goddess Athena in disguise.
However, there's a twist in the Bible's version of this story in Luke 24.
Here, Jesus appears to his followers.
They don't recognize him.
They just can't see him for who he is.
This is a bit different from the usual theoxony,
stories where the God changes their appearance.
Almost most of these stories start with the guest arriving at someone's home.
But in Luke, the story follows a pattern similar to another part of the Odyssey.
In the Odyssey, a character named Telemachus realizes he had a God as a guest the day before.
He prays to this God and then the goddess Athena shows up,
this time looking like someone else.
She offers to help him on his journey.
When they arrive at a place called Pelos, they're warmly welcomed by Nestor.
Even though he's in the middle of a big ceremony for another God,
he's a great host.
Interestingly, he asks his guest who he thinks is just a regular person,
but is actually Athena in disguise to say a prayer.
So in this story, a God ends up praying to another God.
After a big ceremony, Nestor chats with his guests.
In these types of stories, there's often a funny twist
where the audience knows a character is a God in disguise,
but the other characters in the story don't.
Nestor gives some advice to Telemachus,
saying that since the goddess Athena helped his dad in the past,
she might help him too.
The funny part?
Nestor doesn't realize that one of his guests is actually Athena in disguise.
Telemachus, not knowing Athena is right next to him,
doubts that the Gods would help.
Athena, not letting this slide, makes a playful joke using Telemachus' name,
reminding him that Gods can help from afar.
Now, let's think about another common theme in the Odyssey.
A lot of the story is about waiting for someone to come home after a long time away.
When they finally reunite, it's super emotional.
Before the big reunion, there are moments where people talk about the missing person,
not realizing he's right there with them.
This leads to some touching scenes where they finally recognize him.
The cool thing about the Odyssey is that the main character, Odysseus,
often hides his identity on purpose to see if people are loyal to him.
It's like a surprise test.
In Luke 24, there's a cool twist similar to some moments in the Odyssey.
Two disciples, Cleopas and another unnamed one,
are walking and chatting about recent events.
Suddenly, Jesus, who has just been resurrected, joins them.
But here's the twist.
They don't recognize him.
When Jesus asks what they're talking about,
Cleopas is surprised, saying,
you must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn't heard about what's happened recently.
It's pretty funny because Jesus is actually the main character in those events.
It's like when someone talks about a celebrity,
not realizing that celebrity is right next to them in disguise.
Now, who's this Cleopas guy?
Some people try to find a real-life person he might be based on.
But that might be missing the point.
His name gives us a hint.
Cleopas is a shorter version of a common Greek name, Cleopatras.
This name has parts that mean fame or glory and father.
So Cleopas' name might mean the father's glory.
It's like when characters in stories have names that hint at their role or personality.
And just like in those stories, everyone in this one
probably knows what Cleopas' name means.
Later on, Jesus uses a word that means glory in a conversation, tying it all together.
Cleopas was chatting with Jesus, though he didn't recognize him
and mentioned how he had hoped Jesus would have been the one to save Israel.
He knew about some claims that Jesus had been seen after his death,
but he wasn't entirely convinced.
This situation is a bit like a scene from the Odyssey.
Just as a character named Telemachus was doubtful about the God's power
and got corrected by Athena, Jesus now sets Cleopas straight.
And just like Athena made a playful comment about Telemachus' name,
Jesus does something similar with Cleopas.
Jesus points out that it was essential for him to suffer before achieving glory.
It's like he's saying, hey, Mr. Glory of the Father,
I had to go through all that to reach my true glory.
This kind of scene where a divine guest corrects someone who doesn't recognize them
is also in Genesis 18, where Sarah overhears a stranger saying,
she'll have a son within a year.
She laughs because she's way past the age of having kids.
But the stranger who's actually divine hears her and asks why she laughed,
reminding her that nothing's impossible for God.
When she does have a son, he's named Isaac, which sounds like the Hebrew word for laugh.
But the writer of Luke might not have known this detail
since it's not in the Greek version of the story.
Jesus in the story emphasizes that the Messiah, a savior figure,
had to go through tough times.
This idea wasn't common in old religious texts,
but interestingly, there's a similar theme in the ancient Greek epic, the Odyssey.
The hero Odysseus is told by the goddess Athena that he'll face many challenges.
The way Jesus and Odysseus are described is strikingly similar,
hinting that the writers might have been inspired by the same themes.
Fast forward in the story, when Jesus and his two friends reach a place called Emmaus,
they ask him to stay with them.
This is where things get interesting.
They offer him food, a classic move in ancient stories,
when a mysterious guest, often a god in disguise, shows up.
This kind of story is so common that it has its own name, theoxanine.
And just like in many of these stories, Jesus, even though they don't know he's divine, takes the lead.
He says a blessing and breaks the bread for them.
This moment is a lot like a scene in the Odyssey where Athena in disguise says a prayer during a big feast.
The similarities between these two stories are hard to miss.
In the story, there's a moment when the friends suddenly realize who their guest really is.
It's Jesus.
But the story doesn't go into detail about how they figured it out.
It's more about them believing than actually seeing.
This twist in the story is similar to a classic move in the ancient Greek epic, the Odyssey.
The hero Odysseus hides his true identity from even his closest friends and family to test their loyalty.
It's like when someone wears a disguise in a movie and their best friend can't recognize them.
The Odyssey has many moments like this.
For instance, when Odysseus is with a group called the Fayakians, a singer sings songs about Odysseus' adventures.
But no one realizes he's right there in the room.
Then just as they figure out it's Jesus, he vanishes out of thin air.
This sudden disappearance is also a classic move from ancient stories.
In the Odyssey, the goddess Athena does the same thing.
She'll be talking to someone and then poof, she's gone.
And all that's left is a bird flying away.
It's like a magical exit.
This kind of dramatic exit is used in the story to leave the audience in awe and wonder.
Enclosing the narratives, parallels between Genesis and ancient Greek myths are truly fascinating.
While the direction of influence remains debated, these literary overlaps illuminate the shared storytelling heritage of the ancient Mediterranean world.
By analyzing Avidian episodes like Philemon and Bacchus and the Hyraeus myth alongside the biblical accounts of Lot and Abraham,
we gain insight into the literary tropes and folkloric motifs captivated ancient audiences.
The prevalence of theoxinic tales underscores the value placed on hospitality and antiquity.
And the transformation motifs reveal a poetic flair for surprise twists.
While some staunchly defend the originality of biblical texts,
I believe we do the authors a disservice by ignoring the wider literary context.
These stories didn't emerge in a vacuum.
As people of faith, acknowledging the human hand and compiling holy scriptures need not undermine their power,
but failing to recognize the humanity embedded in our religious heritage breeds rigidity and stagnation.
My hope is that analyzing myths across cultures enriches our understanding of shared hopes, fears, and curiosities that have gripped the human imagination for millennia.
Our distant ancestors spun wondrous stories by firelight, imagining gods wandering among mortals.
And we in turn pick up these myths, tracing the threads between civilizations,
realizing anew our common humanity across the ages.
Therein lies the real magic.
