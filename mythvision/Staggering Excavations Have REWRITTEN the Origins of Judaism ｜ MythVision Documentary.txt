Imagine a history not written in stone, but etched in the sands of time, constantly shifting
and revealing new truths.
At the heart of Western civilization and the Abrahamic faiths lies Judaism, a beacon of
spiritual and cultural influence.
But what if this ancient religion, believed to be as old as time itself, was actually
younger than we have ever imagined?
This riveting documentary, backed by cutting-edge scholarship, dares to ask the provocative
question.
With the practice of Judaism as a way of life by the Judeans, truly begin around the
second century BCE, rather than in the deeper recesses of history.
Such a revelation could shatter our understanding of the Bible's antiquity and the roots of
a faith that has shaped the world.

Grab a spade and join us on this unprecedented journey into the heart of Judaism's origins.
This documentary promises to reveal insights so profound.
They will redefine how we view one of the world's oldest religions.
Let's dig in.
Judaism is an ancient religion, but what if we could show you actual evidence that it
isn't as old as the Bible portrays it?
We will dig up the truth using archaeology and see how well this matches the claims of
the biblical texts.
For 2,000 years, the religion of the Jewish people we call Judaism, which is a way of
life completely centered around the laws of the Torah, has been overwhelmingly documented.
This way of life encompasses everything from birth to death for the Jewish people.
The Torah are the laws handed down by God to Moses, written in the first five books of
the Bible.
Of course, MythVision doesn't think Moses actually wrote these books, let alone likely
existed.
So we might ask, if Moses didn't get these laws from God on Mount Sinai in actual history,
then who wrote them?
And when did these laws actually become practiced by actual worshippers of Yahweh?
In this documentary, we want to show you the evidence from archaeology of when Judaism
actually began as a religion, assuming we didn't have the biblical text trying to tell
us these answers.
You may be asking, why not just go with the biblical account to answer this question?
Simply put, the Bible isn't giving us a literal history of past events as they actually occurred.
For example, it's clear that no Exodus happened as recorded in the Bible based on scientific
archaeological research.
We can discuss what the Bible is doing, but one thing it isn't doing is actual accurate
history as we know it in the 21st century.
The scholar of this amazing research will be based off of is Dr. Yonatan Adler, who
is Associate Professor in the Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at
Ariel University in Israel.
He has served as a member of the State of Israel's Council for Archaeology since his
2018 appointment by the Minister of Culture.
His book, which sent shockwaves through the biblical studies scholarly community, is the
origins of Judaism, an archaeological historical reappraisal.
The goal of his work isn't to answer the complex biblical tradition's origins question,
but to reveal the hard archaeological facts of when Judaism actually began as a religion
of the people.
Dr. Adler wants to reevaluate the 19th century hypotheses that the emergence of Judaism happened
in the post-exilic period as early as Persia, meaning these Protestant academics were postulating
that after the Babylonian exile, we find the emergence of post-exilic Judaism with the
religion of pre-exilic Israel being something rather different.
These academics would focus on what biblical authors had to say in order to deduce their
reasoning instead of looking at the behaviors and social history of the general populations
of Judea based off archaeology.
If the general populations of Jews practiced Judaism, this would imply they had the laws.
But if there is no archaeological evidence suggesting that they did practice any of these
laws in these periods, well, this could be clear evidence that no such laws were practiced
or possibly even known by the general folks.
To be upfront, Dr. Adler will express how these Jews in Persia appear to not be practicing
the Torah as their religion until the Hasmonean period, but this is a crucial point I need
to drill down as it lays heavy on my heart for Jews who suffer from ongoing antisemitism.
The Jews or Judeans have existed in Levant way, way back with a continuous tradition
of Yahweh or Yahu or however you want to pronounce the deity of the time worship and even El in
Uqara.
The peoples have had a deep history in these regions, yet what is new or dramatic about
this documentary is their religion or practice of Torah.
Anyone who knows biblical scholarship and its variations of scholarly educated guesses should
be cautious on being too certain about many of the ideas like dating or who actually wrote
these texts, etc.
The academics vary from maximalist to minimalist, dating things in two extremes at some fall
in the middle.
What is not as easy to dispute are the hard archaeological facts of when the lifestyle
articulated in the Torah was practiced by Jewish peoples.
Dr. Adler starts with a time in history where we absolutely know with certainty that Judaism
existed and was practiced by adherents of this way of life following the Torah.
The Torah's teachings guide various aspects of Jewish life, including daily prayers and
rituals, weekly Sabbaths, annual festivals, dietary restrictions, significant events through
one's life, marriage and family matters, legal issues, both criminal and civil, agricultural
practices and rules for maintaining ritual purity.
Additionally, in ancient times, these teachings also included specific rights related to temple
worship.
Dr. Adler starts in a period when Torah practice was clearly happening, using archaeology and
works backwards in history to a period where the practice of Torah are no longer evident
in the archaeology.
This reasoning leads him and me to think the origins of this practice happened when we
see evidence of it in the archaeological record.
I can picture many scholars who have much built so much of their speculations off of a biblical
portrayal being upset at the finds of this groundbreaking evidence.
However, the reason Dr. Adler avoided getting into the questions of when the Torah was written
or the biblical text for that matter is the endless, flimsy speculations which are weak
compared to actual archaeological evidence.
We can guess all day long when it was written and where and all of these things.
The interpretations of Jewish law by rabbis, particularly those compiled in the Babylonian
Talmud, have significantly shaped Jewish life.
However, rabbinic law, or halakha, wasn't universally adopted by all Jews.
Before and even after the emergence of rabbinical authority, various Jewish groups like the
Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes practiced their own interpretations of the Torah's
laws.
Post-70 CE, after the fall of Jerusalem, many Jewish communities followed the Torah's
teachings differently from rabbinic interpretations.
A notable example is the Keraites in the early Middle Ages, but there are many instances
throughout Jewish history of non- rabbinic adherents to the Torah.
We will follow the definitions used by Dr. Adler and his wonderful work around terms
like Judaism, Torah, also Jews, and Judeans, so you can understand the meaning going forward
in this documentary.
I ask that everybody watching this gets a copy of this book because it goes way deeper
than this documentary making the case as solid as possible, so get you a copy.
Judaism.
The term Judaism is chosen to describe a specific way of life.
This choice aligns with both modern English usage and its etymological origins in ancient
Greek.
Judaism, as defined in Webster's Third New International Dictionary, encompasses Jewish
rites, ceremonies, and practices, as well as the broader cultural, social, and religious
beliefs and practices of Jews.
This definition reflects what most English speakers understand by the term today.
Regardless of the contemporary Jewish denomination, practices of Judaism are deeply rooted in
the Torah, serving as either a source of inspiration or formal authority.
For example, a Jew participating in Passover traditions is practicing Judaism, irrespective
of their specific religious affiliation.
The English word Judaism originates from the ancient Greek term Eudaismus, which is derived
from the verb Eudaizo, meaning to act like the Judeans.
In historical contexts, Eudaismus signifies behavior in accordance with the laws of the
Torah.
This study employs Judaism to refer to the Jewish way of life governed by the Torah, focusing
on societal practices rather than individual observance.
The emphasis here is on observable practices rather than beliefs.
This approach is chosen because practices are more visible or visibly discernible in
a large group, whereas beliefs are more abstract and subjective.
Studying a large population's beliefs can often lead to vague generalizations, so the
focus is on the patterns of behavior that can be more concretely observed and described
from an external perspective, like archaeology, Torah.
It's important to know that Torah can mean different things depending on the time and
text.
This is a simple guide to what I mean when I use Torah, Dr. Adler says.
Firstly, Torah in the Hebrew Bible, which is a sacred text for Jews, is a term used
a lot over 200 times.
It comes from a Hebrew word that means to teach or to instruct.
So in this sense, Torah means a kind of teaching or instruction, and it's often linked to
laws and regulations.
In ancient Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible, Torah is translated to mean law.
This version of Torah is closely connected to Moses, who according to these texts received
instructions from God that included various laws.
Secondly, toward the end of a period in Jewish history known as the Second Temple Period,
Torah started being used to specifically refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible.
This is the version of Torah often mentioned in stories about public readings and synagogues.
The third meaning of Torah, which is more common in Jewish religious writings called
rabbinic literature, is much broader.
Here, Torah refers to the whole system of laws and interpretations based on the first
five books of the Hebrew Bible.
These laws are pretty complex, sometimes seem to contradict each other, so they've been
interpreted and discussed a lot over time.
This Torah includes all the debates and different views that various Jewish groups have had
about these laws.
In Dr. Adler's book, when he says Torah, he's talking about this broad, complex system
of laws and interpretations that grew from the first five books of the Hebrew Bible.
When he's only talking about those first five books, he uses the term Pentateuch.
And when he's referring to the original Hebrew or Greek terms in ancient texts, he translates
them as instruction or law.
Jews and Judeans.
The study of ancient text reveals a group known by various names such as Yehudim in
Hebrew and Yehuda'e in Aramaic.
These names dating back to the first millennium BCE evolved over time.
In Greek and Latin, the group was known as Yudei or Yudaioi, and in Latin, Yudei, I'm
probably not pronouncing the Latin correctly, but you get the idea, respectively.
This name further evolved in European languages leading to the English term Jews.
In recent scholarly debates, there's an interesting discussion about the most appropriate term
to use when referring to this group in ancient times.
Some scholars suggest the term Jews implies a religious identity similar to Christian or
Muslim, and argue it should only be used when the group had developed a distinct religious
identity.
They propose using Judeans for earlier periods.
This debate centers on determining the historical point at which the group transitioned from
being Judeans to Jews.
In this study, however, we are not taking a stance in this debate.
Our focus is on the emergence of Judaism among this group.
We need a neutral term that doesn't pre-defined conclusions, and Judeans seems most suitable
for discussing the period from the middle of the first millennium BCE to the first century
CE.
This term helps us discuss early epochs, like the Iron Age, where the term Jews is generally
avoided by scholars.
We will not delve in the origins of the Judeans or Israel as a people in this study.
While their formation into a distinct group is intriguing, our research begins when they
are already recognized as a distinct group.
We will explore when and how the Judeans began to adopt the Torah as a central guide of their
collective way of life.
History of Scholarship
Dr. Adler covers the history of the scholarship on early Judaism in his book.
So it's important that we cover it as well for those interested in understanding where
the field has been and is currently at.
He points out that most of the scholarship is centered around the biblical texts for
drawing conclusions rather than the archaeology from the social history unearthed by people's
actions, which can be evaluated in a concrete way.
Some scholars believe that after returning from the Babylonian exile, the Pentateuch
was widely acknowledged and followed as the Torah.
But this theory hasn't been extensively examined.
In the 19th century, several key scholars significantly influenced the understanding
of early Judaism and the Hebrew Bible.
Wilhelm Martin Liberich Deouet
Now I'm probably butchering the name, but he was around in 1780-1849.
Known as the founder of modern biblical criticism, Deouet's 1804 dissertation argued that Deuteronomy
was written later than the other Pentateuch books.
He identified Deuteronomy as the Book of Instruction, or Book of the Covenant, mentioned in the
days of Josiah.
In later works, he posited a fundamental shift in Judean religion and culture after
the Babylonian exile, distinguishing pre-exilic Hebraism from post-exilic Judaism.
His work, however, was based more on his interpretation of biblical texts than on evidence of actual
practices among the Judeans.
Karl Heinrich Graf 1815-1869
And Abraham Kinnon 1828-1891
Expanding on Deouet's ideas, Graf and Kinnon proposed that part of the Pentateuch dated
to the post-exilic period, as they aligned more with post-exilic works.
Kinnon introduced the term priestly code for these late sources, suggesting Ezra and Nehemiah
played key roles in establishing them as part of the Pentateuch, founding Judaism.
Another of these scholars looked into evidence outside of the Hebrew Bible's literature
to see the actual practices of the Judeans.
Julius Velhalsen 1844-1918
Building upon previous works, Velhalsen formulated the documentary hypothesis, dating different
sources of the Hebrew Bible to various periods.
His 1883 prologamina to the history of Israel had a profound impact, arguing that the Mosaic
Law's promulgation marked the transition from ancient Israel to Judaism.
Edward Meier 1855-1930
Meier's 1896 work suggested that Judaism originated with the Persian Empire's enforcement
of the Torah as law for Judeans.
He differed from Velhalsen by emphasizing the role of Persian imperial mandate rather
than an internal Judean initiative.
These scholars largely focused on literary history of the Hebrew Bible, often accepting
biblical narratives that face value, without seeking additional evidence for the Torah's
influence on the daily lives of ordinary Judeans in the Persian era.
In the 20th century, biblical scholarship built on 19th-century foundations, exploring
new areas such as the literary history of the Hebrew Bible, especially the Pentateuch.
Three discoveries in Mesopotamia and Judean desert enriched comparative studies and textual
criticism.
Scholars also began questioning the graph, Velhalsen documentary hypothesis, considering
alternative theories like the supplementary hypothesis and the fragmentary hypothesis.
However, much of this scholarship continued to focus on the intellectual circles that
authored the biblical texts, without deeply investigating how the legal parts of the Pentateuch
gained authority outside these circles.
The widely accepted division between pre-exilic Hebraism, meaning before 586 BCE, and post-exilic
Judaism, after 538 BCE, remained largely unchallenged.
In the 1990s, scholars revisited Meyers' hypotheses that the Persian Empire authorized
the Pentateuch as the official law for Judeans.
This theory of Persian imperial authorization sparked debates, but lost favor by the early
21st century.
Discussions centered on the accumulated policy towards local, legal norms and whether the
Pentateuch was specifically endorsed by the Persians.
However, there was limited investigation into whether the Persian population of Yehud knew
about the Pentateuch or practiced its laws.
The details of this debate will be explored later in this documentary.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, there was a significant increase in epigraphic discoveries
that provided insights into the rituals and cultic practices of ancient Judeans.
These discoveries included writings on various materials like papyrus, skin, pottery shards,
ostraca, stone, metal, clay tablets, seals, seal impressions, and coins.
Generally these epigraphic remains from the Persian and Hellenistic eras were integrated
under the assumption that the Torah was already an authoritative law for ordinary Judeans.
However, any findings that contradicted this assumption were often dismissed or reinterpreted
to align with the Torah.
A notable example is the collection of the 5th century BCE Judean writings found at Elephantine
in southern Egypt.
This Judean community appeared to be unaware of or in contradiction to the Pentateuchal
Laws.
Some scholars, starting with Valhazan, considered this community an isolated remnant of ancient
Israel, out of touch with mainstream Judaism.
Others like Basil of Porton interpreted the text to portray the Elephantine Judeans as
knowledgeable and observant of Torah laws.
Nonetheless, there was no thorough investigation into whether the broader Judean population
during the Persian period was aware of and regarded the Torah as authoritative.
Archaeological findings related to Judeans in the Persian and Hellenistic periods have
been limited and inconsistent, leading to a lack of archaeological studies on Judean
observance of the Torah during these times.
Ephraim Stearns' studies suggested that the absence of figurines in Judea and Samaria
during the Persian era indicates a religious revolution, consolidating Jewish monotheism.
However, conclusive evidence remains sparse.
In 1992, a book, Judaism, Practice and Belief, E. P. Sanders, or Ed. P. Sanders, introduced
the concept of common Judaism, referring to a set of practices and beliefs shared by
most Judeans in the first century CE.
This concept was groundbreaking for its focus on the everyday lives and beliefs of ordinary
people.
Sanders used a combination of critical analysis of first century text and archaeological evidence
to explore the behaviors and beliefs of average Judeans.
He concluded that during this time, Judeans globally shared a common set of practices
and beliefs centered around the Mosaic Torah and other sacred scriptures.
Sanders' work was pioneering in its rigorous examination of Torah observance among the
masses in antiquity and was notable for incorporating both textual and archaeological data.
While not all of Sanders' arguments gained unanimous scholarly acceptance, his idea
of a shared set of practices and beliefs among ordinary Judeans has been highly influential.
It's worth noting that Sanders focused specifically on the first century CE and did not delve
into the historical development or origins of this common Judaism.
Shay Cohen's 1999 book, The Beginning of Jewishness explores the origins of a distinct
identity he terms Jewishness, emerging from an earlier Judean identity.
Cohen argues that initially terms used for Judeans like in Hebrew and Aramaic language,
Yehudim and Yehudae were purely ethnic, linked to the geographic homeland of these people.
These early Judeans had their own language, customs, institutions, dress, cuisine and
religion.
This single characteristic was predominant in defining their group identity.
Cohen identifies a significant shift during the late 2nd century BCE, influenced by Hellenistic
culture and politics.
The Hasmonean era, according to Cohen, marked a key turning point where the Judean state
under Hasmonean rule transformed into a league allowing the inclusion of non-Judeans.
This period marked the first instance where non-Judeans could adopt Judean religious identity
without assuming their ethnic geographic identity, marking the beginning of Jewishness as Cohen
defines it.
Cohen's work is notable for placing the emergence of a distinct religious identity of Judeans
in the Hasmonean period rather than the Babylonian exile.
His focus is on the categories of identity and the potential for transitioning between
them, posing questions about what defines us versus them and whether they can become
us.
Interestingly, Cohen does not delve into the origins of Torah observance among ordinary
Judeans.
He assumes that by the end of the 2nd century BCE, the Torah was widely known and observed,
focusing instead on when Torah observance became a central characteristic of Judean
identity.
John Collins' 2017 book, The Invention of Judaism, places the Torah at the forefront
of its analysis, tracing the evolution of the concept of Torah in Judean literature
from Deuteronomy to the era of Paul.
Collins highlights a significant transition in the mid-2nd century BCE, which he terms
a Halakic turn.
This period saw a surge in literature deeply concerned with Halakha, Jewish law, evident
in works like the Temple Scroll, Jubilees, and particularly for QMMT.
Before this shift, Collins notes, there was no similar focus on legal obligations in various
Judean literary traditions, including wisdom literature, tales of the Eastern diaspora,
early Inachic literature, and others.
He observes that until the mid-2nd century BCE, the Mosaic Torah was revered and respected,
yet it wasn't necessarily seen as something requiring detailed observance.
Collins' work is significant in understanding the dramatic change in the treatment of the
Torah in Judean literary works after the Hasmonean Revolt.
However, it's important to note that this study is centered on intellectual history,
not social history.
It examines the evolution of the idea of the Torah among generations of Judean intellectuals
and does not delve into whether ordinary Judeans were aware of these intellectual developments
or even if the concept of the Mosaic Torah was widely known among the general Judean
populace.
Reinhard Kratz, historical and biblical Israel, originally published in German in 2013 and
later in English in 2015, distinguishes between the history of Israel and Judah and the biblical
tradition.
Kratz argues that while these two elements are intertwined, they are not identical.
He bases the history of Israel and Judah hype on epigraphic and archaeological evidence
supplemented by critical analyses of the biblical tradition.
Kratz revises Velhausen's idea about the Babylonian exile being a dividing line between
ancient Israel and Judaism.
He suggests that ancient Israel coexisted with Judaism both before and after 586 BCE.
To add clarity, Kratz introduces the term biblical Judaism, commitment to the biblical
tradition and Mosaic Torah, and non-biblical Judaism.
Yahweh devodes his without such commitment.
His study of various Jewish epigraphic records led him to conclude that the Hasmonean Revolt
marked the real historical divide between these two forms of Judaism with non-biblical
Judaism likely predominating before this period.
Kratz's work is significant for acknowledging the possibility that the biblical tradition
including the Mosaic Torah may have been marginal in Judean society for centuries.
His study is among the first to actively consider evidence, especially epigraphic, from the Persian
and Hellenistic periods concerning ordinary Judeans.
He investigates whether these people were aware of the biblical tradition and if they
considered it authoritative.
Kratz, like Cohen and Collins, views the Hasmonean period as a formative era.
For Cohen, it marks the emergence of Jewishness as an identity.
For Collins, it signifies a hellocic turn.
Among Judean intellectuals and for Kratz, it represents the widespread dissemination
of biblical tradition among Judeans.
Dr. Adler builds on the work of Sanders and Kratz focusing on when ordinary Judeans first
learned about, accepted, and practiced the Torah rules.
Our approach combines textual and archaeological evidence.
We'll start by analyzing the range of Torah practices and prohibitions, each in a separate
chapter or section.
The first century CE, a time when these laws were widely known and followed by Judeans,
serves as a starting point for us.
From there, we'll trace back to find the earliest evidence of these laws being known
in practice determining the earliest possible emergence of Judaism.
The concept of terminus antiquem is crucial here.
It's a technical term used in archaeology to denote the latest possible date when something
could have started.
For example, if we find evidence of Torah practices dating back to the 2nd century BCE,
it means Judaism must have emerged by then or earlier.
Our aim isn't to prove that every Judean strictly followed the Torah, but to identify
patterns showing widespread knowledge and adherence to its laws in society.
Our analysis indicates that compelling evidence of the masses knowing and practicing Torah
laws dates back to no earlier than the mid-2nd century BCE.
This sets the overarching terminus antiquem for the initial emergence of Judaism.
Chapter 7 of Dr. Adler's book focuses on reassessing the origins of Judaism before
the earliest date of Torah observance established in the earlier sections.
Since there's no evidence of widespread Torah observance or knowledge among Judeans during
this period, our approach here differs from the data-driven analyses in previous chapters.
In this section, we examine indirect and contextual evidence from the Persian and Hellenistic
periods.
This includes looking at broader textual evidence that previous scholars have considered indicative
of early Judaism.
We'll also investigate whether specific Torah rules or categories of laws were not observed
at certain times.
Although such evidence might be limited in anecdotal, a significant amount of it could
suggest the Torah wasn't yet widely recognized as authoritative.
Additionally, we'll assess the political and cultural contexts of Judeans during these
times.
This involves exploring historical reasons and mechanisms that might have influenced
the emergence of Judaism at a particular time.
Our findings suggest that the Persian period might not be the best era to look for the
origins of widespread Torah observance.
Instead, the period between Alexander the Great's conquests around 332 BCE and the establishment
of the Hasmonean state in the mid-2nd century BCE appears more promising for understanding
the origins of Judaism.
We will examine the text and methodologies used to investigate the origins of early
observance of Torah laws among Judeans.
Historical sources, 1st century texts, works by Philo of Alexandria, Josephus, Flavius
Josephus, are key.
Josephus' writings, which often reference earlier periods, will be critically assessed
for their historical accuracy.
We're going to look at the New Testament.
These texts, generally dated from the mid-1st to early 2nd century BCE, are considered for
their insights.
We're going to look at Greek and Latin authors.
Their works offer valuable, external perspectives on Judean society around the 1st century.
We're going to look at the Dead Sea Scrolls.
These are important for both their archaeological and compositional dates, primarily from the
2nd or 1st century BCE.
We're going to look at Apocrypha and Psydupigrapha.
These challenging to date texts are generally treated as belonging to the 2nd or 1st century
BCE, and of course, the Hebrew Bible.
These texts, mostly composed before the 2nd century BCE, provide evidence for earlier periods
and will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis for more precise dating.
Challenges in using these texts.
These texts were written by intellectuals, not representative of the general Judean population,
which was likely largely illiterate.
The authors might have been influential elites, or fringe figures, with little societal impact.
The texts were not intended as empirical accounts of the masses' behaviors, but were often ideologically
driven.
Any reference to the behaviors of ordinary Judeans in these texts requires careful interpretation
to separate historical facts from the author's idealizations or agendas.
Methodological approach.
Critical reading of these texts is essential, where they advocate for or against certain
practices.
It's important to discern whether this reflects actual societal norms or the author's ideals.
The goal is to extract historically useful information about the real behaviors and beliefs
of ordinary Judeans, distinguishing between historical reality and literary idealization.
Archaeological evidence.
A window to real human behavior.
Archaeology offers a unique glimpse into the past, showing us not just ideals, but real
human actions.
Unlike texts that might convey what people thought or aspired to, the physical remains
unearthed by archaeologists reveal what people actually did.
These artifacts, from tools to pottery, were mostly made for everyday use, not to spread
complex ideas.
They give us a direct look at the lives of ordinary people, not just the thoughts of
a few.
While interpreting these artifacts requires skill, they are invaluable in understanding
the widespread behaviors of past societies, offering a clearer and more tangible picture
of history than texts alone.
This documentary is organized into sections just like Dr. Yonatan Adler's book, each
focusing on specific practices or prohibitions in ancient Judaism.
Purity Laws examines prohibited meats as outlined in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, 3-21.
Ritual Purity Laws investigate laws from Leviticus 11-15 and Numbers 19.
Prohibition of depicting forms looks at the ban on depicting human and animal forms and
artwork, as stated in Exodus 20, 4-5, Deuteronomy 4, 15-18, and Deuteronomy 5, 7-9.
Tephaline and Mazusa Rituals studies these practices based on Exodus 13, 19, 16, Deuteronomy
6, 8-9, and Deuteronomy 11, 18, and 20.
First century Jewish practices explore circumcision, Sabbath prohibitions, Passover sacrifice,
Day of Atonement Fasting, Sukkot Festival rituals, and the Seven Branched Menorah.
Emergence of the synagogue analyzes the development of synagogues and their role in spreading
Torah knowledge.
Each chapter follows a similar format.
The first section establishes the practice or prohibition in the first century, where
we know it's happening.
Second section seeks evidence of these practices before the first century, and then their subsections
focus on textual literary sources and archaeological epigraphic evidence.
Finally, we will examine evidence from periods before the established earliest emergence of
these Jewish elements.
It assesses the likelihood of Judaism's emergence during the Persian period and its potential
development in the early late Hellenistic periods.
Let's begin with what people ate and what this tells us.
Dietary Laws
Dr. Adler goes straight to the heart of the matter with what the Judeans ate.
What the Jews ate separates them from the surrounding peoples.
We will explain briefly what they are permitted and restricted from eating and showing from
the several sources, working from the first century backwards in time, finally assessing
the archaeological evidence to show when they didn't keep the diets prescribed in
the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, which should give us reason to doubt the people
of Judea even knew about these laws, or at the very least, these laws were not known
outside of a small scribal circle.
The Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, contains a variety of dietary
laws that have shaped Jewish culinary practices.
These laws, primarily found in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, categorize certain animals,
fish, birds, and insects as either permissible or forbidden for consumption.
For instance, land animals are generally prohibited unless they have both divided hooves and
chew cudd, excluding species like camels, hares, hyraxes, and pigs.
Sea creatures are only permissible if they possess both fins and scales.
Specific birds are forbidden with lists of these species provided in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.
Additionally, most creeping things, such as rodents, reptiles, and insects, are banned
except for certain flying insects like locusts and crickets.
The regulations also dictate the circumstances under which animals can be eaten.
Animals that die naturally or are killed by other animals are not to be consumed.
The requirement seems to be that animals must be intentionally slaughtered by humans, although
this is not explicitly stated.
Eating blood in certain fats is also prohibited, as is eating an ox that has killed a person.
Newly planted fruit trees have a restriction where their fruits cannot be eaten for the
first three years.
Beyond these general prohibitions, there are also time-based dietary rules.
During the seven-day festival of unleavened bread, all leaven and leavened bread are forbidden.
There are also restrictions on new grain crops until a specific offering is made.
Certain classes of people, like priests or those under a Nazarite vow, have additional
prohibitions such as abstaining from wine and other intoxicating beverages.
Food consecrated for religious purposes also has specific regulations.
For example, the Passover sacrifice must not be eaten raw or boiled, and sacrificial meat
from peace offerings cannot be consumed after the third day.
Consecrated food is also subject to restrictions based on the eater's purity status and the
relation to the priesthood.
An additional custom mentioned in Genesis relates to the avoidance of eating the sinew
of the hip, a practice reportedly stemming from the patriarch Jacob's injury in that
area.
This study aims to explore how these dietary laws were observed by Judeans in the first
century CE.
Evidence suggests that these rules were widely followed, as confirmed by both Judean and
non-Judean writers of the time, and supported by archaeological findings.
The investigation will also delve into earlier periods to trace the origins and adherence
to these dietary practices.
In the first century CE, historical texts provide evidence that Judeans followed strict
dietary laws as outlined in the Torah.
This is supported by both written records and archaeological findings.
One notable source is Philo of Alexandria, born in 25 BCE, a writer of that era.
He delves into the Torah's dietary laws, emphasizing the moral and disciplinary lessons
they impart.
While it's not entirely clear how strictly these laws were followed in daily life, Philo's
narrative indicates a widespread avoidance of pork among Judeans.
A practice that was even recognized in question by the Roman emperor Gaius Caligula during
a Judean delegation's visit in Rome in 40 CE.
Philo's recounting of events in Alexandria, Egypt in 38 CE further illustrates the extent
of this avoidance.
He describes a harrowing incident where Judean women were forcibly fed pork during anti-Judean
riots.
Some women complied out of fear, but others refused and faced torture.
These accounts wouldn't have resonated with Philo's audience if pork consumption wasn't
commonly avoided by Judeans of the time.
While these stories don't confirm adherents to all Torah dietary laws, they strongly suggest
that the community was notably committed to the prohibition against pork.
Overall these examples from Philo's writings, after a glimpse into the dietary customs of
Judeans in the first century CE, highlighting their dedication to certain Torah laws, especially
the avoidance of pork.
In the New Testament, food-related discussions often extend beyond strict adherents to the
Pentateuchal dietary laws.
These texts frequently address broader ethical and social concerns about food, such as eating
meat offered to idols, sharing meals with non-Judeans or those considered sinners, and
the implications of eating certain foods in states of ritual impurity.
For instance, in the book of Romans, the apostle Paul's writing suggests a divergence
in dietary practices within the early Christian community.
He notes that some people believe in eating all foods, while others restrict themselves
to vegetables, which may imply varying attitudes toward following the Torah's dietary laws.
Paul emphasizes a spiritual perspective, suggesting that no food is inherently profane, but becomes
so if someone believes it to be.
He advises against letting food choices disrupt the community's unity.
The book of Acts provides a more direct reference to dietary laws.
It recounts a vision experienced by Peter where he sees a variety of animals and is instructed
to eat them.
Paul initially refuses, citing their status as unclean according to Jewish law.
However, the vision's message, repeated thrice, is what God has cleansed should not be considered
profane.
This vision is interpreted as an allegory for the inclusion of Gentiles into the early
Christian community, equating them with the animals in the vision and arguing that they
should not be seen as unclean.
Additionally, a letter from the early Christian leaders in Jerusalem to Gentile believers
advises them to abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled animals,
and from fornication.
This directive likely stems from the belief that the meat of strangled animals contains
blood which is prohibited.
This guidance, while not encompassing all Jewish dietary laws, indicates an effort to
bridge the dietary practices of Jewish and Gentile Christians, rooted in the broader
principles outlined in Genesis regarding the sanctity of life and blood.
Overall, the New Testament's approach to dietary laws reflects a shift from strict
adherence to Jewish law towards a more inclusive and spiritually-orientated understanding of
food practices, while still acknowledging the importance of these laws in the Judean
community.
Flavius Josephus, a first-century historian, frequently commented on the dietary practices
of Judeans, highlighting their strict adherence to religious food laws.
He detailed several specific prohibitions, including the consumption of animals that
died naturally, certain fats from goats, sheep, and oxen, a specific sinew, pork, and
other unspecified animal species.
Josephus emphasized the importance of properly cleansing meat to remove blood before it could
be considered fit for consumption, reflecting a key aspect of these dietary laws.
Josephus noted the exceptional dedication of Judeans, particularly the Essenes sect,
to these dietary restrictions even under the threat of torture or death.
This commitment was so integral to their identity that those accused of violating these
laws often faced severe social backlash within their communities.
Some Judeans, when accused of eating forbidden foods, would flee to the Samaritans for refuge,
underlying the severity of such accusations.
Interestingly, Josephus also observed the influence of Judean dietary practices beyond
their community.
He claimed that many non-Judeans across the Roman world had begun to adopt some of these
dietary restrictions.
This adoption was part of a broader trend, where various aspects of Judean religious
practices, including observing the Sabbath and other rituals, gained popularity among
different populations.
Josephus's writings provides a comprehensive look at the dietary customs of Judeans in
the first century, highlighting their strict observance and broader influence of these
practices and how they had that practice and its influence in the Roman world.
Writings from various Greek and Latin authors between the first and early second century
CE provide additional perspectives on dietary practices of Judeans, particularly their
avoidance of certain foods like pork.
This abstention was often noted and discussed by these authors, indicating its prominence
as a cultural identifier.
For instance, the Greek geographer Strabo, commented on what he perceived as the Judeans
superstitious avoidance of meat.
Appian Makothos, a Hellenized Egyptian writer, specifically criticized Judeans for not eating
pork.
Similarly, Arashianus, writing in the late first century CE, advised medical practitioners
to consider the ethnic background of their patients, suggesting abstention from prescribing
pork to Judean patients.
Plutarch, a Greek biographer and essayist, delved into the reasons behind the Judean
abstention from pork, debating whether it was due to reverence for the animal or aversion.
He also noted their avoidance of hair meat.
Aetacitus, a Roman historian, offered a different perspective, hypothesizing that Judeans avoided
pork due to a historical association of pigs with a skin disease that reminded them of
a past plague.
The satirist juvenile humorously remarked on the longevity of pigs and Judea due to their
abstention from pork, implying that his audience was well aware of this Judean dietary practice.
Sextus empiricus, a philosopher, echoed the sentiment of phylo, and Josephus regarding
the links to which Judeans would go to avoid eating forbidden foods, including during torture
or death rather than consume pork.
Epictetus, another philosopher, observed that the consumption of pork was a contentious
issue among various cultural groups, including Judeans, Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans.
Finally, Pliny the Elder, a Roman author, mentioned the Judean dietary restrictions regarding
fish, although his understanding of the specifics appears to have been somewhat inaccurate.
These diverse observations from non-Judean authors illustrate the widespread awareness
and discussion of Judean dietary customs in the broader Greco-Roman world.
They highlight how Judean abstention from certain foods, especially pork, was a notable
and discussed aspect of their cultural and religious identity.
Archaeological Insights into Ancient Diets
Really the first century.
In the field of archaeology, various traces left behind by ancient civilizations provide
us with insights into their way of life.
Among these, remnants of ancient meals, particularly food remains, are especially revealing.
Unlike the often subjective accounts of ancient texts, these remains offer a more objective
view of the diets and eating habits of past societies.
Archaeology mainly provides insights into certain dietary laws mentioned in the Pentateuch,
such as those relating to animal consumption.
The bones of animals, for instance, are key archaeological finds that shed light on ancient
diets.
However, interpreting these remains can be challenging.
For example, while certain markings on bones can suggest deliberate butchering, their absence
doesn't necessarily indicate natural death or predation.
Our focus will be on two specific groups prohibited in the Pentateuch, pigs and scaleless fish.
These are chosen because their remains are frequently found in archaeological sites across
the Levant.
Conversely, remains of other animals mentioned in the Pentateuch, like dogs, horses, or camels,
are less common and harder to link directly to human consumption.
The data analyzed here comes exclusively from southern Levantine sites, particularly those
identified as Judean.
A common misconception in scholarly literature is interpreting the absence of certain foods
in archaeological records as evidence of ancient dietary taboos.
Just because a population didn't consume a particular food doesn't mean they considered
it wrong or inappropriate.
Numerous factors could influence dietary choices, and absence alone isn't sufficient
to imply a societal prohibition.
It's crucial to explore various plausible explanations before concluding that a dietary
choice was taboo-driven.
While it's hard to prove that a food was deliberately avoided for normative reasons,
it's easier to show the opposite.
If we find significant evidence of a particular food in ancient diets, it's safe to assume
that this food wasn't widely shunned.
In other words, finding remains of pigs or scaleless fish in Judean sites would suggest
that at least some inhabitants didn't avoid these foods.
With this framework, we now examine the presence or absence of pigs and scaleless fish in the
zooarchaeological record for first-century Judeans, aiming to draw reasonable conclusions
about their dietary practices.
For the past 30 years, scholars have extensively studied pig consumption in the southern Levant,
particularly during the Iron Age.
However, there is less comprehensive research on this topic for the Persian, Hellenistic,
and Roman periods, yet some site reports from these eras do provide relevant data, and this
discussion Dr. Adler draws upon a research study done in 2005 by Liora Kulska Horwitz
and Jacqueline Studer Ram Balknitz.
Forgive me if I butchered your names.
Unpublished 2011 doctoral thesis and recent archaeological reports from the last decade.
I want you to look at this table with me.
The table represented here, which is found in Dr. Adler's book, shows the frequency
of pig remains in selected early Roman, mostly first-century CE, Judean archaeological sites.
The data includes the number of identified specimens, NISP, of pig bones, the total NISP
of all animal bones, and the percentage of pig bones relative to the total.
The number of identified specimens shortened is called NISP.
So when you look at the chart, you'll see NISP, number of identified specimen, which
is a count of how many bones of a given species were found.
Look at this at the top, you can see, which is really table one.
You'll see Qumran, Jerusalem, Eastern City Dump, Jerusalem City of David, notice pig
bones, NISP, zero, zero, zero, zero, and then you get to Eastern City Dump three, Jerusalem,
Park and Lott, one.
You can keep going, you can see some of the numbers are higher than others.
But in the second site, which are Roman-era non-Judean sites, there's a frequency that
is much higher in some of these areas.
And this, pretty much, I asked Dr. Adler, how do we simplify this?
And he said, pretty much, in Judean sites, you get no pigs, in non-Judean sites, you
get pigs.
And of course, if there is one or two bones that they do find, you could argue really
simply that maybe some of these Judean sites had Gentile or non-Judeans in these locations.
It's also possible that not every Judean followed the law at this period.
The frequency of pig bones at Judean sites are notably low compared to non-Judean sites
from around the same period.
Non-Judean sites, less affected by destruction during the first century Judean revolt, provide
more stable data for this era.
Table two, of course, as we said, represents pig bone frequencies from Roman-era non-Judean
sites.
The stark contrast between the two sets of data strongly suggests that pig consumption
was rare or nonexistent at first century CE Judean sites, but common at non-Judean sites
at the same time.
This aligns with the hypotheses that Judeans avoided pork due to the Taurus proscription
against pig consumption.
However, other explanations might also exist for this phenomenon.
The absence of pig remains in Judean sites is consistent with the Taurus dietary rules,
but we should also consider alternative hypotheses.
This is particularly important for earlier periods where textual evidence is scarce.
Interestingly, pig bones do appear occasionally, albeit in small numbers at Judean sites.
These could represent remains left by non-Judean visitors, ethnic minorities, scavengers, or
even deviations from dietary laws by some Judeans.
While the Taurus dietary rules were widely observed, absolute adherence was not universal.
In the southern Levant, archaeological sites have revealed remains of scaleless fish, primarily
categorized into two groups, cartilaginous fish, including sharks and rays, and catfish.
The term catfish encompasses several families, but in the Levant, Clara Day is native, found
in coastal rivers and the Sea of Galilee, among other places.
Bagra Day and Makla Day are non-native, brought from the Nile.
Both cartilaginous fish and catfish lack scales and therefore could have been avoided according
to dietary laws in the Pentateuch.
Studying whether 1st century CE Judeans consumed these fish is difficult due to limited available
data from this period.
The evidence we have is not comprehensive enough to make definitive conclusions, but
it offers some insights.
In Jerusalem, two fish assemblages from the early Roman period were found.
One assemblage contained four catfish bones, 1.4% of total fish bones, and the other included
three catfish bones, and one shark bone, 3.5% of total.
Notably, all catfish bones were identified as non-local, originating from the Nile at
Masada.
327 fish bones were found, all from fish with both fins and scales, suggesting adherents
to dietary laws.
In Caesarea, an early Roman period cespit near Herod's Hippodrome contained three catfish
bones out of 107 fish bones, 2.8%.
Given Caesarea's mixed population of Judeans and Greek-speaking non-Judeans, it's unclear
who consumed these fish.
The current data set is too limited to draw firm conclusions about the fish eating habits
of first-century Judeans.
The low frequency of skellish fish remains suggest these were not commonly eaten.
However, the presence of some skellish fish remains, especially in Jerusalem, hints at
possible occasional deviations from the Torah's dietary prohibitions.
More comprehensive studies are needed for a clearer understanding of these ancient dietary
practices.
But both textual and archaeological evidence from the first-century CE largely corroborate
the understanding that Judeans adhered closely to their dietary laws, notably avoiding pork
and possibly other prohibited species like skellish fish.
The archaeological record, while aligning with historical texts, also leaves room for
further research and discovery, especially regarding the consumption of fish.
This comprehensive approach provides a nuanced understanding of the dietary habits and cultural
practices of first-century Judeans.
Evidence suggests that Judean dietary restrictions were known in the Roman world by the first-century
BCE.
For example, a tale, recounted by the 5th-century Latin author Microbius, features a quip by
Augustus about Herod the Great humorously hinting at Herod's adherence to Judean dietary
laws by preferring to be Herod's pig rather than his son, a reference to the avoidance
of pork.
Earlier, a letter from 43 BCE noted by historian Josephus exempts Judeans from military service
acknowledging their inability to bear arms on the Sabbath and their specific dietary needs.
A similar decree from Sardis, also mentioned by Josephus, directs market officials to ensure
appropriate food for Judeans.
These documents, if authentic, indicate a broader awareness of Judean dietary customs.
Diadorus Siculus, writing around the same period, references the unique laws of Judeans,
possibly alluding to their dietary rules.
He also describes an event where Antiochus, the 4th, designated Judean sacred texts and
compelled Judeans to consume pork, a direct violation of their laws.
Additionally, a remark by the Roman orator Cicero, around 70 BCE, preserved in Plutarch's
later writings, humorously touches on the Judean aversion to pork.
The Dead Sea Scrolls, some dating back to the Hasmonean period, contain references to
penituncal dietary prohibitions.
These include straight-forward bands on consuming blood, as seen in the Genesis Apocryphon and
the Temple Scroll.
The Damascus document offers more detailed discussions on the consumption of blood in
fish and permitted insect species like locust.
It concludes that fish blood is prohibited, while the treatment of locusts differ due
to their unique biological makeup.
The Temple Scroll also forbids carrion, and another manuscript for Q. Halaka A. references
the prohibition of consuming torn animals.
There's also a discussion on the consumption of a fetus removed from a properly killed
pregnant animal, with the fetus being seen as not directly killed by humans, thus either
categorized as carrion or torn, interestingly, while texts in the scrolls engage in detailed
interpretations of dietary laws, including criteria for permitted insects and a mention
of a prohibited bird species.
They don't explicitly mention a ban on pork.
This absence doesn't necessarily indicate non-observance among contemporary Judeans,
but highlights the scroll's role in reflecting a culture deeply invested in discussing and
possibly debating these dietary laws.
In the realms of the Apocrypha and Pseudopigrapha, texts potentially dating to the last two
centuries BCE, references to Judean dietary laws frequently emerge.
Jubilees, for instance, emphasizes the prohibition against consuming blood, threatening severe
consequences for violators.
Notably, it specifies the blood of beasts, birds, and cattle are off limits, perhaps
implying an acceptance of fish blood contrary to other interpretations.
The Testament of Asher delves into the complex definitions of clean and unclean animals, citing
pigs and hares as paradoxically half-clean, yet essentially unclean, reflecting the penitoucal
verses.
In doing so, it also allegorically ties these dietary laws to moral virtues and vices, indicating
that such rules were familiar to its audience.
The letter of Aristius contains a detailed explanation from the high priest Eleazar to
an Egyptian delegation about the rationale behind considering certain animals unclean,
such as non-cloven, hooved animals, or those not chewing cut, including birds of prey.
The narrative of the Maccabean period, particularly in the books 1, 2, and 4 Maccabees, highlights
the significance of these dietary laws through stories of Judeans who chose martyrdom over
violating these restrictions, specifically eating pork.
While the historicity of these accounts is uncertain, they reflect the importance of
dietary laws to their authors and audiences, what we call verisimilitude.
According to the Hebrew Bible outside the Pentateuch, evidence for dietary restrictions is sparse,
mainly appearing in cultic or ritual contexts rather than everyday diet.
For instance, Saul's troops are criticized for consuming meat without properly draining
the blood, seen as a cultic misstep rather than a dietary one.
Similarly, Isaiah's condemnation of consuming pigs, flesh, is framed with the context of
idolatrous practices, not as a general dietary rule.
In Ezekiel, dietary regulations are addressed specifically to priests, with no indication
of broader applicability.
Even Daniel's choice to avoid royal food in Nebuchadnezzar's court seems more a personal
or cultic decision than inherent to any known dietary law.
The Pentateuch itself doesn't imply that its food regulations were formalizing already
existing taboos.
The only long-standing food taboo mentioned is the avoidance of the hip sinew, as narrated
in Jacob's story, which is possibly an etiological legend created to explain an ancient practice.
Beyond this, there is no textual evidence to suggest widespread observation of dietary
restrictions among Judeans or Israelites before the 2nd century BCE, archaeology on pigs.
In the Hasmonean and Herodian periods, few Judean sites have reported pig remains.
At Herodium, about 7.6% of the animal bones found in a construction area were from pigs,
but the workers' ethnicities are unknown.
At Qumran, spanning from the Hasmonean to the early Common Era, no pig bones were found
in four different contexts.
Similarly, no pig remains were identified at Nebi Samwil.
In Jerusalem, during the Hasmonean Era, pig bones constituted a minimal portion of the
faunal remains, 0.6% in one area and 0.2% in two others.
Moving further back to the early Hellenistic period, pig remains were equally scarce.
During the period from 586 to 332 BCE, pig remains were rare or absent in Judean sites.
For example, at Ramat Rahel, only 2% of the bones were from pigs, and in another area
of Jerusalem, the percentage was a mere 0.1% iron and bronze age context.
Moving into the iron and bronze ages, the presence of pig remains becomes more varied.
During the Iron Age IIc, pig remains were nearly absent across the region, including
Judah, Philistia, and Edom.
In the Iron Age IIb, pig remains were more common in the Northern Kingdom of Israel,
but rare in the Southern Kingdom of Judah and other areas.
This pattern continues in the Iron Age IIa, with pig bones mostly absent from southern
Levant sites, except in Philistine urban centers.
In the Iron Age I, pig remains were virtually absent in the Southern Levant, except in Philistine
areas.
During the Late Bronze Age IIb through III, pig remains were either absent or found in
negligible amounts at most sites, with notable exceptions in areas under Egyptian influence.
Interpreting the data, the absence of pig remains across various periods and regions
suggests that multiple, cultural, ecological, and socio-economic factors influenced animal
husbandry and consumption practices.
Hesse and Wopnish proposed several pig principles, such as environmental conditions, settlement
patterns, and economic factors, affecting the choice to raise pigs.
However, new research has shown that these factors can have unpredictable effects.
In summary, while pork consumption was limited among early Iron Age Highlanders and later
Judeans, it was also uncommon among other groups in the region.
This suggests that the avoidance of pork was likely due to a combination of ecological,
economic, and possibly cultural factors, rather than a specific cultural taboo, fish.
The study of ancient fish remains provides valuable insights into the dietary habits
and cultural practices of historic populations.
This analysis focuses on fish bone assemblages discovered in various archaeological sites
in Judea, primarily around Jerusalem, dating from the Iron Age II to the Hellenistic period.
In the last decades of the 1st century BCE, two significant fish assemblages were discovered.
At Masada, 1,494 microscopic fish bones were found in fish sauce remnants, with no scaleless
fish remains identified.
Similarly, a collection of 38 fish bones from the northern slope of Herodium from the same
period also lacked scaleless fish.
Three smaller fish assemblages from Jerusalem's Givati parking lot dating to the Hellenistic
period provide a rare glimpse into the fish consumption practices of that era in Judea.
These assemblages vary in the frequency of catfish bones, indicating differing consumption
patterns across periods.
More extensive assemblages from earlier periods, specifically the Persian period, were found
in the same location and nearby area G in the city of David.
These collections show a higher percentage of catfish bones, including one assemblage
with remains possibly from a shark or a ray.
A notable pattern emerges from the Iron Age II, circa 950 to 586 BCE, assemblages where
scaleless fish, especially catfish, are prevalent.
These finds come from various locations in Jerusalem, including the Afel, the eastern
slope of the city of David, and the Givati parking lot.
An important assemblage from Ramat Rael also highlights this trend, with a significant
number of catfish bones discovered.
These findings reveal that scaleless fish, particularly catfish, were commonly consumed
in Judea during the first half of the first millennium BCE.
Pattern appears to continue into the Persian period, although data from the Hellenistic
period are too limited for definitive conclusions.
These dietary patterns challenge the notion that the dietary restrictions in the Pentateu,
particularly the prohibition of scaleless fish, were based on long-standing consumption habits.
Instead, it suggests that such prohibitions were established independently, indicating
a deliberate choice by the Pentateuchal authors rather than inheritance to existing cultural
norms.
This could imply that other dietary laws in the Pentateuch might also have been formulated
without being rooted in pre-existing dietary traditions.
This section explored the earliest evidence of Judeans following dietary rules like those
in the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible.
Research into texts and archaeological finds showed that by the first century CE, Judeans
were well known for strictly following specific dietary laws.
These included avoiding pork, as shown by the scarcity of pig remains and Judean sites
from this period, unlike in non-Judean areas.
Evidence also suggests that Judeans avoided scaleless fish, though this data is less conclusive.
However, before the second century BCE, there is no clear evidence of such dietary practices.
The only hint of an early food taboo is a story in Genesis about avoiding the hip sinew.
While pork wasn't a major part of Judean diets from the Iron Age onwards, this doesn't
necessarily mean it was due to a religious or cultural taboo.
Furthermore, the widespread presence of scaleless fish bones from this era suggests that the
dietary rules against such fish from the Pentateuch weren't yet followed.
In summary, it appears the strict dietary restrictions among Judeans, as detailed in
the Pentateuch, only began to be observed from the Hasmonean period onward.
Purity Laws You might be, like me, thinking, how can one
know if people practiced purity restrictions or rules in archaeology?
I soon found out that this was easily answered by archaeologists like Dr. Adler.
This section will reveal textual and archaeological evidence to show you where these practices
clearly happened in history with people actually practicing these purity laws and when the
evidence doesn't support them practicing it.
The concept of binaries like clean, dirty, or pure contaminated is common across human
societies, both ancient and modern.
This might be rooted in disease avoidance, as even early societies without scientific
knowledge understood the dangers of contamination.
These physical binaries often extend into moral judgments such as good, bad, or right
wrong.
This is not surprising since physical contamination can lead to diseases and similarly moral contaminants
might be seen as causing social problems.
Many cultures also use these binaries to describe more complex and abstract concepts which we
can term ritual purity.
This concept goes beyond simple physical or moral cleanliness.
In ancient Judean society by the first century CE, there was a detailed set of rules about
ritual purity based on the Pentateuch.
These rules outlined causes of impurity, how it spreads, and how to restore purity.
Impurities could come from various sources like certain animal carcasses, childbirth,
skin diseases, or contact with the dead.
Different actions like touching or carrying these sources could transfer impurity to remove
impurity.
Procedures like wading, bathing, or in some cases specific rituals were prescribed.
The rules were extensive, covering clothing, utensils, houses, and food.
Each had specific guidelines for purification including washing, burning, or destroying
contaminated items.
By the first century CE, these rules were not only interpreted by scholars but also actively
followed in daily life.
This section will explore the origins and evolution of these practices, tracing back
to the earliest evidence of their observation in Judean society.
Textual Evidence
Philo of Alexandria observes, which he is a Jewish philosopher, refers to various purity
laws in his writings.
For instance, he mentions that after marital relations, both partners must bathe before
touching anything.
He also talks about specific impurities like gonorrhea and scale diseases, explaining that
affected priests must wait for these conditions to clear before resuming their duties.
Furthermore, he describes how touching a corpse or experiencing nocturnal emissions requires
purification rituals, including bathing and waiting until evening.
New Testament Accounts
The Gospels and Acts in the New Testament provide a more vivid depiction of Judeans actively
practicing these purity laws.
They highlight rituals like hand washing before meals, immersing after visiting the market,
and purifying dining utensils and furniture.
These accounts indicate these practices were common and expanded upon the original Pentateuchal
regulations.
Josephus's Reports
Josephus, a first century Jewish historian, frequently cites the purity laws in his work.
He notes that people with certain impurities like scale diseases or during menstruation
were restricted from entering parts of Jerusalem or the temple.
He also describes how these laws impacted daily life, such as avoiding cities built over
gravesites due to the risk of impurity, archaeological evidence, first century purity AD.
Stepped Pools
Across Judea, Galilee, and Paria, over a thousand stepped pools have been found, mostly
dating from the early Roman period, mid first century BCE to 132-135 CE.
These pools, lined with waterproof plaster and often connected to rainwater channels,
feature steps leading down to the pool floor.
For decades, scholars have identified these as ritual baths used for purification, a viewpoint
supported by the physical features of these pools.
The design of the pools, with steps leading directly into and out of the water, suggests
they were primarily used for immersion.
The distribution of these pools aligns almost exclusively with areas known to have been inhabited
by Judeans.
Their absence in non-Judean settlements further supports their cultural specificity.
This pattern, coupled with the construction and features of the pools, confidently identifies
them as Judean ritual immersion pools.
Want you to look at the immersion pool that we saw at Magdala, the synagogue.
Historical texts like those in the New Testament and writings by Josephus corroborate the use
of water immersion for ritual purification among Judeans.
This aligns with the widespread construction of these pools, suggesting that ritual immersion
was a common and regular practice, not limited to specific groups or religious occasions.
The pools were used not only for temple visits, but as part of everyday life in maintaining
ritual purity.
The locations of these pools vary, indicating different uses.
Most are found in residential areas, suggesting daily domestic use.
Others are near public spaces like synagogues, temples and agricultural sites, implying broader
communal and occupational purposes.
This variety reflects the significance of purity, ritual, in various aspects of Judean
life during the first century CE.
The archaeological evidence of stepped pools in Judea from the first century CE strongly
suggests that ritual immersion for purity was a widespread and integral part of daily
life, reflecting a deep cultural and religious practice, chalk vessels.
Chalk vessels, commonly found in Judean archaeological sites from the first century CE, offer
intriguing insights into the cultural and religious practices of the time.
These vessels, made from soft chalk, include various forms such as mugs, pitchers, bowls
and large jars.
Scholars generally agree that Judeans produced these chalk vessels due to a belief in their
resistance to ritual impurity.
Interestingly, chalk was not a popular material for making tableware or storage containers
in other periods or regions of the southern Levant.
The widespread use of chalk during this specific era raises questions about why Judeans chose
a material otherwise deemed impractical for such purposes.
In the Roman, early Roman period, materials like clay, metals, glass and wood were commonly
used for tableware and storage, but Judeans uniquely opted for chalk.
This choice seems to be connected to their strict adherence to the purity laws found
in the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible.
These laws detail how different materials react to impurity.
For instance, pottery needs to be broken if impure, while other materials can be purified.
Stone vessels, however, are not mentioned in these laws, leading to the belief that
they do not become impure.
This understanding likely influenced the Judeans to create vessels from chalk, a form of stone.
Despite its porosity and dustiness, they might have applied treatments or silents to overcome
these drawbacks.
The use of chalk vessels was apparently widespread among Judeans, indicating a broad adherence
to ritual purity laws in their daily lives.
The chalk vessels distribution pattern, confined mainly to Judean settlements, supports this
interpretation.
Escavations in the Lower Galilee have unearthed large-scale production sites, suggesting a
significant demand for these vessels among Judeans.
This phenomenon, using chalk vessels, sheds light on the Judeans' religious practices
and their interpretation of purity laws, showing a commonly deeply engaged in maintaining
ritual purity in everyday life.
Based on textual and archaeological evidence, it's clear that the Judeans were practicing
these purity laws during the first century AD.
Now let's turn to earlier periods and see what we find.
Before the first century AD, textual evidence of purity.
Textual evidence from various sources provides insights into the practice and evolution of
ritual purity laws among Judeans, particularly the Hasmonean 140-37 BCE and the Herodian
37 BCE to 73 CE periods.
Josephus, a first century Jewish historian, relates two stories from the late first century
BCE that emphasize the importance of ritual purity.
One story involves a high priest who becomes ritually impure due to a dream, demonstrating
the observance of purity laws in temple practices.
Another story hints at concerns over Gentile soldiers impacting the purity of Judeans during
temple festivals.
Josephus also mentions a decree by Seleucus I Nikidor, which accommodated Judean customs
regarding the use of oil, potentially indicating early adherents to purity laws.
The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated from the 2nd or 1st century BCE, contain detailed expansions
on the Pentateuchal Laws of Purity Ritual.
These texts show how Judean communities like those at Qumran interpreted and developed
these laws, such as regulating or having regulations on bathing for purification and specific rules
regarding corpse and skin disease impurities.
The Apocrypha and Pseudopigrapha, ancient Jewish writings occasionally reference ritual
purity laws.
These texts provide further evidence of the observance of purity laws, with narratives
demonstrating inheritance to dietary restrictions and purification practices.
Josephus also cites a proclamation by Antiochus III Megas, suggesting that Pentateuch-like
purity laws were observed among Judeans as early as the 2nd century BCE, however the
authenticity of the document is debated.
When examining the Hebrew Bible, texts thought to predate the 2nd century BCE show limited
evidence of a system or ritual purity similar to that of the Pentateuch.
While moral and ritual purity is a reoccurring theme, detailed regulations akin to the Pentateuchal
laws are largely absent, suggesting these practices may not have been widely known or
observed among Judeans before the 2nd century BCE.
These various texts collectively indicate that while some form of ritual purity laws
was known and practiced among Judeans, the detailed system found in the Pentateuch likely
became more prevalent and developed in later periods, especially during the Hasmonean and
Herodian times, archaeology before the 1st century AD on purity.
Immersion pools First century BC evidence, archaeological
findings show numerous immersion pools from the 1st century BC, especially in palaces
of Herod the Great.
These pools, often found near living quarters or bathhouses, suggest a widespread practice
of ritual purity, earlier evidence.
Pools dating back to the Hasmonean period, mid 1st century BCE have been discovered, indicating
an even earlier practice of ritual purity, however the exact start date of these practices
remains unclear.
Chalk vessels Late 1st century BCE, findings of chalk vessels
from this period, primarily in Jerusalem and Jericho, indicate the use of specific materials
for ritual purity.
Earlier periods, no clear evidence links earlier stone vessels to ritual and purity practices.
Epigraphic evidence Elephantine inscriptions, a text from the
5th century BCE refers to concepts of purity, but its connection to Pentateuchal laws is
not definitive.
This lack of clarity extends to other inscriptions as well.
Conclusions 1st century CE, there is substantial evidence
of adherence to ritual purity laws among Judeans.
Before 2nd century BCE, earlier evidence does not clearly demonstrate the practice of Pentateuchal
ritual purity laws.
This indicates that the widespread observance of these laws likely began after or around
the 2nd century BCE.
While there is strong evidence of ritual purity practices in the 1st century BCE and CE, tracing
these practices back to their origins remains challenging due to limited and ambiguous archeological
and epigraphic evidence.
The evidence does suggest the common folks were not practicing these rituals on a massive
scale, if at all, before the Hasmonean period.
Figural Art The Decalogue, or 10 Commandments, found
in the Bible's books of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, begins with the directive that uniquely
acknowledges Yahweh as God, forbidding the worship of other gods.
This is evident in the commandment, I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt out of the house of slavery.
You shall have no other gods before me.
Early Jewish scholars like Philo and Josephus viewed this as the first commandment.
The subsequent verses, often seen as separate commandment, forbid creating graven images
or idols, regardless of whether they represent other deities or not.
This prohibition covers any form that exists in the heavens, on the earth, or in the waters.
The text emphasizes Yahweh's exclusive devotion and the consequences of idolatry, extending
to multiple generations, but also highlights the enduring love for those who follow these
commandments.
In Deuteronomy 4, the prohibition against creating images is more expansive.
It includes any living creature, given that no physical form was seen when Yahweh spoke
to the Israelites.
This comprehensive ban includes a representation of male or female figures, animals, birds,
and aquatic life.
The rationale is that any depiction of a living creature might be misconstrued as a representation
of Yahweh, who was formless.
This section aims to explore how 1st century Judeans interpreted these commandments, particularly
the broad prohibition against depicting living creatures in art.
This includes both sacred and secular contexts.
Despite some depictions existing, there was a general trend among Judeans to avoid figural
art of living creatures.
This section will investigate the earliest evidence of this practice and seek to understand
the historical context and reasons behind this phenomenon.
The focus is not the origins of aniconism, the avoidance of images and religious practices,
or the development of monotheistic worship in Judean culture.
Instead, the emphasis is on how and when the legal prohibition against figural art became
a widely observed practice.
This exploration is crucial for understanding the cultural and religious dynamics of the
period.
Evidence from the 1st century writers, in examining the writings of Philo and Josephus
to prominent figures in the 1st century, we find compelling insights into the prohibition
of certain artistic expressions among Judeans.
This prohibition, which goes beyond mere religious worship, is intriguingly distinct from the
worship of multiple deities and offers a glimpse into the broader cultural and philosophical
attitudes of the time.
Here's Philo's perspective.
Philo delved into the decalogue, emphasizing that while those who transgressed the 1st
commandment by worshiping multiple gods were indeed in error, their offense paled in comparisons
to artisans who violated the 2nd commandment.
These artisans, according to Philo, were guilty of crafting images from various materials,
such as timber, stones, silver, and gold, and disseminating them throughout the world.
In Philo's view, these artistic endeavors were far more detrimental as they clouded
the eye of the soul and obscured the true understanding of the ever-living god.
For Philo, the act of creating such artistic illusions was akin to leading souls astray
through deception and false impressions, a sentiment that echoed Plato's earlier views
on deceptive art forms.
What stands out in Philo's perspective is his allusion to an actual contemporary context
in which Judeans refrained from certain forms of painting and sculpture, even when these
had no direct connection to religious worship.
Let's look at Josephus' insights.
Josephus shared Philo's perspective, distinguishing between the act of crafting certain images
and the worship of foreign deities, although at times these two elements converged.
Josephus recounted instances where Judeans vehemently opposed the introduction of Roman
imperial cult images into Jerusalem, illustrating the collision of artistic representation with
a religious practice.
However, Josephus also elucidated that Judean law prohibited the depiction of living creatures,
even when these representations had no association with foreign gods.
He made it clear that this prohibition extended not only to idolatry, but also to profane
artistic depictions such as Greek family portraits.
Josephus argued that these practices were unprofitable to both God and humanity, thereby
emphasizing the distinct nature of this prohibition.
Josephus provided further evidence of this prohibition by describing the adornments of
the desert tabernacle enclosure on the Holy of Holies, emphasizing the absence of representations
of living creatures.
Notably, he omitted mention of the embroidered cherubim, a design mentioned in a pentatucal
prescriptions.
When Josephus did discuss the golden cherubim set upon the Ark cover, he portrayed them
in an apologetic manner, highlighting their uniqueness.
Additionally, Josephus condemned King Solomon for creating animal images for the molten sea
and his throne, interpreting these actions as impious in light of the prohibition against
graven images.
Interestingly, the biblical narratives about Solomon did not express wrongdoing, emphasizing
that Josephus' perspective was influenced by the authoritative Torah of his time.
In another example, Josephus narrated his involvement in demolishing a palace in Tiberius,
constructed by Herodantipus, which featured representations of animals in its architectural
elements.
Josephus explained that such architectural styles were forbidden by the Laws, reinforcing
the idea that the prohibition extended beyond religious idols to encompass any graven images.
Here's a perspective beyond Judea.
The avoidance of statuary among Judeans was notably enough that it drew the attention
of non-Judean writers in the first century, Strabo, the Greek geographer, that Moses had
instructed against all forms of image carving.
Similarly, the Roman historian Tacitus noted that Judeans revered a single formless god
and reframed from crafting representations of gods in human form.
This prohibition extended to statues not only in religious contexts, but also in cities
and temples.
Even their mortal kings and the emperors did not receive the honor of statuary.
Tacitus' account highlights that the Judean aversion to graven images extended beyond
religious worship and had broader cultural implications.
The first century writings of Philo and Josephus, as well as accounts of non-Judean sources,
provide valuable insights into the prohibition of certain artistic expressions among Judeans.
This prohibition went beyond religious worship and encompassed the creation of graven images,
reflecting the cultural and philosophical attitudes of the time, archaeological discoveries
of the first century.
Fortunately, a significant body of archaeological artifacts from the first century CE adorned
with various forms of artwork and linked to Judean culture had endured to the present
day.
In this section, we'll explore this evidence to assess the prevalence of figural art avoidance
as described by the first century authors.
The wealth of evidence under examination encompasses artistic designs found on coins designed
for Judean use, decorative elements in architecture, funerary art, as well as artwork on pottery
and various small archaeological artifacts.
It's important to note this investigation will primarily focus on finds from the southern
Levant as the number of decorated artifacts from the first century CE that can be conclusively
associated with Judeans outside this region is quite limited.
Looking at coins, throughout the first century CE, Judean coins meant for local use were
typically adorned with images of inanimate objects or floral motifs with a notable absence
of figural representations of humans or animals.
This practice sharply contrasted with coinage in most other parts of the Roman world, where
numismatic imagery commonly featured portraits of the reigning emperor on the obverse side
or depictions of the emperor's family members.
The reverse side of these coins often displayed additional human or more rarely animal figures
often drawn from Roman mythology.
In the neighboring independent king of Nabataea, coins featured portraits of the king and queen
occasionally including images of eagles.
However, coins meant by Archelaus and Antipas, who succeeded Herod as rulers in different
regions, maintain the traditional of non figural motifs.
Archelaus' coins showcased items like cornucopias, naval symbols, and grape clusters, while Antipas'
coins exclusively featured floral designs such as palm trees and wreaths.
Notably, none of these coin types included figural images.
In contrast, coins meant by Philip, another of Herod's sons and successors, consistently
featured portraits including those of Augustus, Empress Livia, or Tiberius and sometimes
Philip himself.
This stark difference in numismatic practices among Herod's heirs was not coincidental.
Archelaus and Antipas ruled over regions with predominantly Judean populations, while Philip
governed territories in the northeastern part of Herod's realm, where non-Judeans were
the majority.
The circulation of Philip's coins was primarily limited to his territories, with none found
within Judea proper.
The pattern continued with Herod's grandson Agrippa I, who minted coins with figural images
for non-Judean subjects and coins without figural images for Judean citizens.
Agrippa initially ruled over non-Judean territories where he issued coins featuring portraits of
Emperor Gaius Caligula, the imperial family, Agrippa himself, and his royal family members,
subsequently when he assumed authority over Judea, Samaria, and Udydumia.
Agrippa's coinage for these regions notably lacked figural representations, employing
a fringed royal canopy as a non-figural substitute for a portrait.
This consistent avoidance of figural images in Judean coinage for a specific audience
is evident throughout the historical period.
During the Great Revolt in 66 CE, the rebel authorities minted their own coins, featuring
various designs devoid of human or animal depictions.
These motifs included a chalice, emphora, floral patterns, possibly pomegranate, grape leaves,
palm trees with date baskets, and symbols associated with the Sukkot holiday.
This avoidance of figural art was not merely a form of anti-Roman protest, but rather a
cultural identity marker.
In Agrippa II, a Roman client and opponent of the revolt produced coins for the Judeans
of Seferus in 67-68 CE that lacked figural art.
These coins included references to Emperor Nero, but omitted his portrait.
It is clear that the use of non-figural imagery on these coins was a deliberate choice, despite
Agrippa II's Roman affiliation.
Furthermore, Roman prefects and procreators who administered Judea throughout the 1st century
CE also refrained from featuring images of emperors, humans, or animals on their coins.
Instead, their coinage showcased innocuous symbols such as palm trees, grain, wreaths,
and various inanimate objects.
Notably, these non-figural coins, produced under Roman prefects and procreators in Judea,
were unique within the Roman Empire.
Even under the prefect Pontius Pilate, coins featured coltic symbols like the simpulum
and litius, which, though used in Roman religious rituals, did not violate the prohibition against
graven images according to penituchal passages.
Interestingly, silver and gold coins were not minted in Judean mints during the 1st century CE.
Scholars have debated the reasons for this, but it is undeniable that Judean mints did
not produce precious metal coinage.
Consequently, silver coins used locally were likely imported from foreign mints.
The dominant source of silver coins in Judea was the Tyrion mint, which depicted the Tyrion
god Melchart, Greek Heracles, on the averse side and an eagle on the reverse.
Other foreign coins, primarily Roman Denari, also circulated in Judea, bearing images of
humans, animals, and Roman deities.
These foreign coins were the only silver coins available to Judeans for major financial
transactions and temple donations.
Despite their figural imagery, this pragmatic behavior among 1st century Judeans demonstrates
their adaptability to the prevailing circumstances.
Archaeological evidence from the 1st century CE reveals a consistent avoidance of figural
art on Judean coins, even when neighboring regions or Roman authorities typically included
such imagery.
This pattern underscores the cultural and religious significance of avoiding graven images
among Judeans during this period.
Despite practical considerations that sometimes necessitated the use of coins with figural
representations, architectural decorations in Judea a unique perspective.
In addition to examining numismatic evidence, we will now delve into the archaeological
remnants of architecture decorations in the 1st century Judea to gain insights into how
individual Judeans and their communities viewed figural art.
This exploration allows us to better understand the preferences and attitudes toward imagery
within private homes and public structures.
In the broader Greco-Roman world surrounding Judea, figural art was a pervasive feature
used extensively to adorn both public and private architecture.
Across the Mediterranean, we find images of humans, animals, and mythological creatures
adorning various architectural elements such as floor mosaics, painting on walls, and
sillings and carvings on columns, in tablatures, and roof antifixes.
This architectural imagery was undeniably a hallmark of Greco-Roman architectural embellishment.
However, 1st century Judea stands out as a remarkable exception to this prevailing trend.
Judean floor mosaics, for instance, either lacked ornamentation entirely or featured
geometric or floral designs exclusively never including depictions of humans, animals, or
mythological figures.
Prominent examples of 1st century CE floor mosaics can be found in the private residences
of Upper City of Jerusalem.
These mosaics showcase various designs like multi-pedaled rosettes, pomegranates, stylized
palmet leaves, and chessboard patterns.
Borders were typically rendered in straight lines, wave crests, and triangular sawtooth
designs.
Occasionally, corners were adorned with spandrels or simple gamma motifs.
It's worth noting that the sole instance of a figural image on a 1st century CE mosaic
floor, plausibly linked to Judean owners, is a fragmentary depiction of a fish or possibly
a dolphin and that was found at the bath house at Magdala.
Similarly, the most notable examples of 1st century CE painted wall plasters, both frescoes
and secco paintings, were discovered in private homes in the Upper City of Jerusalem, although
similar examples had been found elsewhere in the region, such as Magdala and Lodepata
in Galilee.
These paintings often featured a scheme that divided the walls into framed, rectangular
panels, painted with alternating colors.
Some panels included wavy lines and striations to create a marble-like effect.
Floral designs were also common, featuring clusters of apples and pomegranates among
leaves along with hanging garlands.
One architectural motif depicted fluted ionic columns supporting an entablature with a schematic
representation of a Doric freeze, complete with triglyphs and plain metopes.
Importantly, these wall paintings consistently lacked depictions of humans or animals.
To the best of our knowledge, the only instances of figural art in the 1st century CE wall paintings
are the depictions of birds found in a single private residence on Mount Zion.
When we turn our attention to carved stone and molded stucco decorations from the 1st
century CE Judean context, we find that they closely followed Greco-Roman styles but
seldom incorporated figural representations.
For example, one reception hall in a private house in the upper city of Jerusalem featured
walls adorned with stucco arranged in panels mimicking courses of Bost Ashlar's.
The ornamental stucco sillings in the same room boasted a pattern of triangles, squares,
hexagons, and octagons along with an egg and dart motif.
Additionally, a relief carved stone discovered in a synagogue at Magdala showcased architectural
elements, utensils including the seven-branched menorah, amphoras, and an oil lamp, as well
as various floral and geometric designs all without any figural depictions.
These archaeological findings provide a unique glimpse into the artistic preferences and
cultural attitudes of 1st century Judeans.
Despite the prevalent use of figural art in the wider Greco-Roman world, Judea maintained
a distinctive focus on non-figural designs in its architectural adornments during this
period.
Judean funerary art in Judea symbols and avoidance of figural images.
Judean funerary art in the 1st century CE comprised various forms of artistic expression
including carved decorations on rock cut tombs in size designs on osuaries and sarcophagi
as well as rare paintings on tombs, osuaries, and wooden coffins mainly found in the Judean
desert.
Let's explore the intricate details of these artistic expressions while also noting the
significant absence of figural imagery.
Rock cut tombs, both their facades and internal chambers, were often adorned with carved designs
meant to mimic architectural features like ashlar walls, columns, both attached and
freestanding, entablatures, and occasionally pediments.
These carved architectural elements were consistently decorated with geometric and floral motifs.
Notably, among the hundreds of 1st century CE Judean tombs excavated or surveyed, none
that had been found to contain carvings depicting humans or animals.
Osuaries and sarcophagi, which served as containers for human remains, also displayed ornate carvings
or in size designs.
These decorations primarily featured geometric patterns, floral motifs, and architectural
elements.
Geometric designs included rosettes, concentric circles, zigzag lines, and chessboard patterns.
Figural motifs encompassed various leaves, flowers, fruits, pommettes, wreaths, and garlands,
grapefines, and palm trees.
Architectural elements often depicted tomb facades, entrances, columns, and ashlar walls.
Other motifs included vessels such as an amphorae, canthorae, forgive me if I butchered that
eminorus.
Notably, the no osuaries or sarcophagi were ornamented with figural art, with the exception
of one osuary, featuring schematic outlines of an ox skull it looks like, a design whose
classification as an animal image might be questioned.
While much rare paintings found in Judean tombs, osuaries, and wooden coffins, as well
as a graffiti on tomb walls, provide further insights, some surviving fragments of paintings
in Judean shephela region depict geometric and floral designs.
Among the best preserved wall paintings are those in the 1st century CE Judean tomb known
as the Goliath tomb in Jericho, featuring masonry, wreaths, grapefines, geometric patterns,
resembling pergolas, and fragments of three birds.
Few osuaries and wooden coffins from the Judean desert have been discovered with paintings,
often displaying garlands, fruits, flowers, branches, rosettas, and simple bands.
Graffiti in Jason's tomb in Jerusalem, which remained in use for the 1st century BCE, into
the 1st century CE, include schematic depictions of ships, seven branched menorahs, a chalice,
a palm branch, and a stag with antlers.
Importantly, these instances of birds in the Goliath tomb and the stag in Jason's tomb
constitute the sole examples of figural images found in 1st century CE Judean's funerary
contexts.
Turning the pottery in small finds, the majority consisted of functional items that were typically
left undecorated.
When ornamentation was present, it typically featured simple and sized lines, geometric
patterns, and floral designs, almost never figural images of depicting humans or animals.
One notable aspect is the avoidance of contemporary Roman lamps decorated with central discusses,
featuring humans, animal, and mythological images.
Judeans favored the use of an unadorned or minimally decorated Herodian lamps instead.
Interestingly, a shift toward mold-made lamps with various motifs occurred in the 1st century
CE, including geometric patterns, scrolls, wreaths, grape clusters, pomegranates, rosettes,
palm trees, and four-eye menorahs and symbols related to the festival of Sukkot.
While exceedingly rare, some examples of these lamps did incorporate figural imagery, such
as birds and fish.
Notably, certain copies of these lamps featured disfigured figural images replaced by holes
indicating a deliberate effort to alter or avoid such depictions.
Rare instances of figural art on small finds, including gravings of a fish on a stone table
top, a bronze fitting shaped like an animal's paw, a bone, gaming piece featuring a human
hand, and an etching of two sacrificial birds on a chalk core.
Figural images on engraved gemstones used as sills, decorative pieces, or amulets were
also infrequently found in clearly Judean archaeological contexts.
Despite these exceptions, the general pattern observed in Judean funerary art in the 1st
century CE is the avoidance of figural representations in favor of geometric, floral, and architectural
motifs.
Early evidence of Judean avoidance of figural art.
The evidence we've examined thus far leaves no doubt.
In the 1st century CE, Judeans, with only a few exceptions, refrained from creating
artistic representations of humans and animals.
Every source from this period, especially the writings of Josephus, make it clear that
such depictions were considered forbidden by Torah law.
In this discussion, we explore whether this practice can be traced back to earlier times.
We'll demonstrate that there is strong evidence of Judeans avoiding figural art from the 1st
century BCE and the latter part of the 2nd century BCE, but no evidence exists for earlier
periods.
Textual evidence from the era of Herod the Great, late 1st century BCE.
Josephus recounts a story from the late 1st century BCE about two Judean scholars who,
as Herod the Great, fell ill near the end of his life, encouraged their followers to
remove a golden eagle that Herod had placed above the Great Gate of the Jerusalem Temple,
defying ancestral laws.
According to Josephus in War of the Jews, these scholars objected to the eagle because
it was seen as unlawful to place in the temple either images or busts or any representation
whatsoever of a living creature.
While this explanation suggests that the prohibition against images applied only to the temple
in antiquities, Josephus described the prohibition more broadly.
The law forbids those who intend to live in accordance with it to think of setting up
images or making depictions of the likeness of any living creature.
In War, Josephus also mentions that about 40 young men involved in removing the eagle
were caught, and when brought before Herod and asked who had ordered them to carry out
this act, simply replied, the ancestral law.
In antiquities, Josephus has these men explain at length their actions were in accordance
with the law that Moses wrote as God prompted and taught him and left behind.
The question arises, which specific precept of the Mosaic law did the golden eagle above
the temple's gate as a donation violate?
In antiquities, Josephus describes the eagle as Herod's anathema, a Greek term denoting
a votive offering donated to the temple.
Nowhere does it imply that any Judeans regarded the eagle as an idol to be worshipped.
By the time of this incident, the eagle had presumably been hanging above the temple gate
for some time, and everyone recognized it as an ornamental sculpture with certain ideological
significance, no doubt, but certainly not as an idol worthy of worship.
Therefore, it appears that the eagle was not viewed as a violation of the first commandment
of the Decalogue, which prohibited the worship of foreign gods, but rather as a violation
of the second commandment, which forbade the creation of graven images depicting living
creatures regardless of whether these images were objects of worship, figural art in these
earlier sources.
While Judean literary sources before the Herodian era certainly reveal an awareness of common
Judean aversion to idolatry, earlier sources do not seem to provide clear evidence, a prohibition
against figural art that was not intended for worship.
We won't delve into all the biblical sources that strongly condemn the worship of Deity's
represented in physical form.
What's noteworthy is that none of these texts seem to be aware of a ban against non-worshiped
figural artwork, artistic depictions of humans or animals for secular purposes.
On the contrary, as we've seen, the authors of texts in both Kings and Chronicles speak
rather favorably of the 12 molten bulls that Solomon casts as supports for his molten sea,
as well as the sculpted lions adorning his grand ivory throne.
Solomon's temple is even described as filled with sculpted and embroidered images of bulls,
lions, and winged cherubim, none of which seem to have incurred the displeasure of the
biblical authors.
Herod the Great's time.
In the first century CE, there was a distinct lack of artistic representations of people
and animals in the archaeological findings of the era.
This absence of figurative art was also evident during the reign of Herod the Great.
Herod's coins, much like those from the first century CE, purposely avoided depicting individuals
such as Augustus, the imperial family, Herod himself, or his royal family.
Instead, they featured various symbols and objects.
Similarly, the palaces built by Herod discovered at locations like Caesarea Maritima, Jericho,
Cyprus, Herodium, Masada, and Macarus rarely contained figural art.
Even when ornate mosaic floors were uncovered, they typically displayed geometric patterns
or floral designs.
Paintings on the palace walls followed the artistic styles popular in the contemporary
Roman world, but omitted figurative motifs.
Only a couple of instances of rooms with figural images have been found, such as frescoes with
birds in a bath house at Upper Herodium, and scenes with humans and animals in a royal
theater box.
Even Herod's construction projects on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem were devoid of figurative
elements, featuring only geometric and floral designs.
Similarly, smaller artifacts from the late first century BCE, like oil lamps and clay
medallions, mostly lacked figurative images.
A rare or few rare exceptions included lamps with possible human faces and a clay medallion
depicting a woman's bust.
These findings suggest a deliberate avoidance of figurative art during Herod's time, both
in public and private settings, reflecting the cultural and religious preferences of
the period.
The Hasmonean era, the Judean coinage during the Hasmonean period, which peaked between
134 to 37 BCE, is distinctive for its lack of human or animal figures.
Instead, these coins typically featured various symbols, like a double cornucopia with what
looks like a pomegranate, as well as other designs such as a flower, a palm frond, a
military helmet, an anchor, and a star-shaped motif.
One notable innovation came from the last Hasmonean ruler Metathias, Antigonus, who
depicted temple vessels on his coins, a seven-branched menorah on one side and the table of the
showbread on the other.
What sets these Hasmonean coins apart is the prominent use of texts.
They bear inscriptions densely covered much of the coin's surface, providing the ruler's
name and title, along with references to the assembly of the Judeans.
This was a deliberate attempt to convey the image of the Hasmonean leader without resorting
to a graphic representation.
This is quite unique, as there are no comparable coins from the Hellenistic world of that time
that entirely replace a ruler's image with text.
The underlying message here is clear.
These coins reflect a commitment to the Torah's ban on images, supported by the political
leadership.
Interestingly, one of the earliest Hasmonean coins doesn't even mention a Judean ruler
but rather a Seleucid king, Antiochus VII Yergetes.
These coins were minted in Jerusalem shortly after John Hercanus assumed leadership of
the Hasmonean polity.
Another coin type from the same period displays a helmet and an afflaston on the reverse side,
both surrounded by Greek inscriptions referring to King Antiochus.
These coins were likely struck by Hercanus to appease his Seleucid overload.
The absence of the Seleucid king's image, replaced by a text bearing his name and title,
highlights the Judean aversion to figurative images.
Notably, figurative art is absent not only from Hasmonean coins, but also from the palaces
at Jericho and the Judean Desert, which foreshadowed later Herodian palaces.
These sites feature the first known non-figural mosaic floors in the region, dating to the
mid-1st century BCE.
In fact, I'm not aware of any examples of Judean material culture from this era, whether
in domestic, public, or funerary contexts that incorporate images of humans or animals.
During the Seleucid and Ptolemaic periods, there are fewer archaeological findings associated
with Judeans compared to the later Hasmonean and Herodian periods.
One notable discovery is the monumental structure found in Iraq, El Emir in Transjordan.
This structure includes a frieze adorned with large sculptures of lions and eagles, as well
as fountains shaped like sculpted lions.
Scholars commonly link this construction to the fortress described by Josephus, which
was built by the Judean aristocrat Hercanus, son of Joseph, in the early 2nd century BCE.
Josephus mentioned that this fortress featured beasts of gigantic size.
Before the time of John Hercanus I, there is a gap of over 100 years during which no
coins were minted in Judea.
Prior to this gap, Judean coins from the reigns of the first two Ptolemaic kings dating to
the first half of the 3rd century BCE are known.
These silver coins typically displayed the portrait of either the king or queen on one
side and a standing eagle on the other, accompanied by an inscription in Paleo-Hebrew script
reading Yehuda.
These coins are believed to have been minted by Judeans in Jerusalem, but under the influence
of the Ptolemaic authorities, it remains uncertain whether the Judean mentors had any reservations
about including these images on their coins.
Dr. Yonatan Adler's book is fantastic.
He has so many more sources and goes into way more depth, I highly recommend anyone
to get the book.
The Persian Era in Ancient Judea The earliest known Judean coins date back
to the 4th century BCE during the final phases of the Achaemenid rule.
These coins feature various images of humans and animals and are identified as Judean due
to inscriptions in Paleo-Hebrew or Aramaic script.
These inscriptions typically mention the province of Yehuda or the names of Judean officials
such as Jonathan, the priest, or Jezekiah, the governor.
Some of these coins' designs were inspired by Athenian coins, featuring the head of
Athena and her attributes.
Other motifs on Judean coins include eagles, bearded men, lions, and mythological creatures.
These coins were minted by Judean officials, including priests and governors.
In addition to coins, lion stamps were used to mark storage jars in Judea, possibly for
administrative purposes like taxation.
These stamps dated to either the late 6th century BCE under Babylonian rule or the early Persian
period.
Later stamps featured inscriptions mentioning the province of Yehuda and Judean officials
but lacked pictorial elements.
Terracotta figurines, depicting humans and animals, have been found at some Judean sites
during the Persian period.
However, the number of these figurines is relatively small compared to other regions
in the southern Levant.
Some scholars suggest this may indicate a shift towards a more exclusive and an iconic
worship of Yahweh among Judeans.
But it's unlikely that this reflects a prohibition against figurative art, especially given
the presence of figurative images on contemporary coins.
A few artifacts from Persian-era Judea depict foreign deities such as the goddess Estarte
and the Egyptian goddess Osiris.
Greek deities are also represented on some jar handles with gemstone impressions.
These findings suggest a degree of cultural exchange and diversity in religious iconography.
Outside Judea, among the Judeans in Babylonia, seals from Marushu Archive dating from 455
to 403 BCE have been discovered.
These seals associated with Judean individuals feature various figurative motifs, including
humans, animals, and mythological creatures.
Another Judean seal from the Yahuda Archive dating to the late 6th century BCE depicts
a worshipper before symbols of Marduk and Ishtar.
In summary, during the Persian era in Judea, there was a variety of coin designs, the use
of lion stamps, terracotta figurines, and artifacts depicting both local and foreign
religious imagery, reflecting the complex cultural and religious landscape of the time.
Here's the conclusion on Figural Art.
We have delved into the question of whether Judeans began to abstain from creating visual
representations of humans and animals in their artwork following what was perceived as a
directive from Torah law.
The evidence suggests a notable shift in artistic practices among Judeans in the 1st century
CE.
During this period, Judeans produced various forms of art that conspicuously avoided depicting
humans or animals, with only a few exceptions.
This trend is particularly evident in the coin designs used locally by Judeans, where images
of emperors and Judean rulers were consistently absent.
Literary sources, including the works of Josephus, provide a clear explanation for this archaeological
pattern.
A widespread belief among Judeans that Torah law prohibited the artistic representation
of living creatures.
This practice of adhering to the prohibition can be traced back to the 1st century BCE and
the final decades of the 2nd century BCE, when Judeans minted coins that intentionally
omitted figurative depictions.
Before this period, there was a significant hiatus in Judean coins, minting and limiting
archaeological findings associated with Judeans, both of which displayed minimal artistic elements,
whether figurative or non-figurative.
Going further back in time, we encounter coins from the early 3rd century BCE that featured
portraits of Ptolemaic monarchs and an eagle.
Even earlier in the 4th century BCE, Judean authorities produced a wide array of coins
that consistently featured images of animals and humans.
Importantly, these choices and coin imagery were not influenced by Persian directives,
indicating that figural art did not pose a problem for Judeans in the late Persian period.
There are kata figurines and Judean sills with figurative elements from the Akameinid
times further support this conclusion.
This observation aligns with the scholarly consensus that from the Hasmonean era onward,
there was a noticeable aversion to figural art among Judeans.
Various theories have been proposed to explain the shift, including the influence of Sadducees
or Pharisees, a reaction against Hellenization, and a response to the events of 167 BCE, such
as the desecration of the temple by Antiochus IV.
However, these theories lack sufficient evidence to be conclusively supported.
A more plausible explanation, as suggested by some scholars, is that the ban on figural
art was initiated by the Hasmoneans, whose political and military policies were influenced
by the book of Deuteronomy, which emphasized the avoidance of images.
This prohibition served as a boundary marker between Jews and non-Jews, rather than viewing
the prohibition on figural images in isolation.
It is worth considering the possibility that adherence to this prohibition reflects a broader
commitment to Torah Laws in general.
The evidence represented here offers a precise, terminus Antiquim, a limit before which, for
when this shift may have occurred around 131 BCE, when imageless coins bearing the name
of Antiochus VII were minted in Judea.
Prior to this, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether Judeans were actively
seeking to adhere to the Pentateuchal ban on images.
Over two centuries earlier, during the Persian era, Judean authorities demonstrated no concern,
whatsoever, for such a prohibition, as they included figurative images on all their minted
coins.
Tephelene and Mazuzat
In Deuteronomy 5, 1-6, 3, and 11, Moses instructs the Israelites to keep certain words close
to their hearts and to regularly discuss them, especially with children.
These words, possibly referring to the Horeb Theophany, or commandments to love Yahweh,
should be, 1, held in the heart, 2, taught to children, 3, discussed at all times, 4,
symbolically tied to the hand, 5, placed between the eyes, and 6, written on house doorposts
and gates.
This directive is echoed in Exodus 13, focusing on rituals like the Festival of Unleavened
Bread and the Redemption of the Firstborn.
These passages influenced two first-century Judean practices, wearing Tephelene and placing
Mazuzat.
Tephelene involved binding small animal skin cases with Pentateuchal text on the body,
specifically on the hand or arm and forehead, following the instruction to have a sign on
the hand and a reminder between the eyes.
Mazuzat, referred to inscribing Pentateuchal passages on doorways, growing from the command
to write these words on doorposts and gates.
This chapter, or section, examines the literary and archaeological evidence of these practices
in the first-century CE, tracing their origins and development over time.
Textual Evidence
Philo of Alexandria
Philo interprets the Deuteronomy passages allegorically.
He sees the command to bind rules of justice on the hand as a symbol of action and suggests
that these rules should always be in sight, close to the eyes.
His interpretation seems more metaphorical than indicative of a specific physical practice.
However, regarding the command to write on doorposts, Philo envisions a literal practice
of placing engraved plaques or writings at the entrances of houses, which aligns with
the concept of Mazuzat.
The Gospel according to Matthew, in the Gospel of Matthew, there is a mention of Phalaqaria,
commonly translated as phalacteries, when criticizing Pharisees and scribes for their
showy piety.
This reference has been interpreted to mean Tephelene, although Matthew may have actually
referred to the protective cases used for Tephelene rather than the amulets themselves,
highlighting their use as a display of devotion.
Josephus provides a more detailed account, diverging from simple paraphrasing of biblical
texts.
He describes a practice where words possibly related to God's power and benevolence are
physically inscribed and worn on the arm and head.
This description closely resembles the practice of wearing Tephelene, suggesting a concrete,
visible ritual rather than a purely metaphorical one.
These literary sources, though not extensive, hint at an existence and nature of Tephelene
in Mazuzat practices in the first century.
Phylo's allegorical interpretations in the Gospel of Matthew's possible reference to
Tephelene cases suggest a metaphorical and physical aspect of these practices.
Josephus provides a more direct reference indicating a physical manifestation of these
rituals that aligns with what is known about Tephelene.
Collectively, the sources along with archaeological evidence offer a glimpse into the religious
life and practices of first century Judeans.
Now let's turn to archaeological evidence.
The primary discoveries include small leather cases and thin animal skin slips with penituncal
passages.
These were mainly found near Kerbet-Kumran, with a smaller number from other Judean desert
locations.
The dating of these artifacts suggests they are around 68 CE, with some possibly from
the 132-135 CE Bar Kokba Revolt.
These are the characteristics of the artifacts.
The leather cases were designed to hold the inscripted slips.
Some cases were found with slips still inside while others were empty.
The slips contain selected passages from Exodus and Deuteronomy, focusing on verses that instruct
to bind a sign upon the hand and between the eyes.
The small sides of the slips and their storage in sealed cases indicate they were not intended
for reading but for ritual use.
The presence of straps on the cases implies they were designed to be worn on the body.
The specific text chosen for these slips, along with their method of storage, suggests
a literal interpretation of biblical verses commanding the binding of certain words on
the hands and forehead.
This practice, known as tepheline, is evidenced to breed eight rabbinic times, showing a long-standing
tradition of interpreting and implementing these biblical instructions.
The archaeological evidence from the Judean Desert offers a tangible link to the ancient
practice of tepheline, underscoring its historical roots and meticulous approach to religious
observance in first-century Judean society.
These findings not only confirm the existence of the practice but also provide insights
into the religious and cultural context of the period.
Honestly, you've got to get Dr. Adler's book because it goes into much more depth
and detail on sources and evidence to show this is the case.
Now let's turn to understanding ancient interpretations of religious law through tepheline.
Tepheline are ancient Jewish artifacts that provide insights into how religious instructions
from the Torah were interpreted long ago.
By examining these artifacts, we can trace back the thought processes of ancient Judean
scholars.
The way tepheline are designed with different compartments for holding scriptural slips
reveals much about these interpretations.
For example, the Torah instructs that words should be bound as a sign on the hand and
as a remembrance between the eyes.
From this, we can infer that tepheline with a single compartment were likely worn on the
hand while those with multiple compartments were worn on the forehead.
This idea is not new, it aligns with ancient Jewish legal texts suggesting a long-standing
tradition.
Moreover, all tepheline found in the Judean Desert contain one or more of four specific
verses from the Torah showing a consistent practice.
However, there's variation in the additional verses included indicating different approaches
to interpreting the Torah.
Some tepheline contain only the specific sections where tepheline wearing is mandated, reflecting
a literal interpretation.
Others include verses from preceding sections suggesting an attempt to understand the broader
context and original intent behind these laws.
These variations highlight the diverse ways ancient Judeans engaged with and interpreted
their religious laws.
Studying these artifacts helps us appreciate the rich history of religious thought and practice
in ancient Jewish culture.
Maurice Bellit, and I probably butchered her name, forgive me, identified a scroll from
Kumran Cave 8 as a Mazooza due to its textual content and physical characteristics.
Despite differences from traditional rabbinic Mazooza texts, Joseph Malik found additional
text in Kumran Cave 4 distinguishing these Mazoozat from tepheline based on skin thickness
and quality.
However, the classification of these texts as Mazoozat is debated as they contain content
more typical of tepheline.
The absence of archeological evidence for first century Mazooza practices in the Judean
desert suggests such rituals if practiced left no surviving trace.
The use of perishable materials or wooden door jams from Mazooza inscriptions could explain
the lack of physical remains leading to the conclusion that inscribing Mazooza text on
stone was not common practice among first century Judeans.
Before we go into earlier evidence of these practices, we have seen that in the first
century the practice of tepheline observance was in full swing.
Though the practice of Mazooza may be less certain, it is very likely the practice was
happening in the first century, but we shouldn't be certain.
Earlier textual evidence.
Letter of Aristius This ancient letter describes Jewish dietary
impurity laws.
It mentions symbolic reminders on clothing, gates, and doors, possibly referring to biblical
instructions about fringes on clothes and teachings on doorposts.
The letter diverges from the original biblical text mentioning sayings on doors, not doorposts,
and finding a sign on hands, but not between the eyes.
This deviation raises questions about the writer's knowledge of rituals like Mazooza,
doorposts, scriptures, and tepheline, phylacteries worn on the body.
Septuagint This Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible
offers mostly straightforward translations of relevant passages.
However, its interpretation of a phrase about keeping divine words between your eyes suggests
a metaphorical understanding, possibly referring to constant mental focus on these teachings.
Textual variation introduces ambiguity with some versions implying a tangible object near
the eyes.
But it's unclear whether this indicates knowledge of tepheline-like practice.
Hebrew Bible Beyond the Pentateuch The first five books of the Bible, there are no clear
references to tepheline or Mazooza-like rituals.
Proverbs 6 20-22 metaphorically speaks of binding ethical teachings of parents on one's
heart and neck, indicating moral teachings should always be kept in mind.
But this doesn't suggest a concrete ritual practice.
While these texts hint at practices similar to tepheline and Mazooza, their interpretations
and implications are not straightforward.
The letter of Oristius might be our earliest text suggesting these rituals, though its
differences from biblical instructions and the ambiguity in the Septuagint's translation
leave room for debate about the existence and nature of these practices in earlier times.
Let's look at earlier archaeological evidence.
In the Judean Desert, archaeologists and epigraphic experts have uncovered significant artifacts
related to the practices of tepheline and Mazooza.
These items were discovered in caves near Qumran, alongside other relics that date back
to around 68 CE, when Kerbet Qumran was abandoned.
Interestingly, tepheline discovered in different Judean Desert caves were found with artifacts
dating as late as the Bar Kokba Revolt.
While it's possible that some of these artifacts might have been created before the first century CE,
this hasn't been definitively proven.
These artifacts haven't undergone radiocarbon analyses due to their small size and the destructive
nature of such tests.
Instead, scholars rely on paleographic analyses of the inscribed letter forms to estimate their age.
Unfortunately, only limited paleographic analyses have been conducted on the tepheline texts,
mainly relying on initial observations made by the original discoverers.
While some Qumran finds have been dated to the first century CE, based on paleographic analyses,
others argue that the script closely resembles that of the second and first centuries BCE,
which continued without significant changes until the middle of the first century CE.
If this assessment is accurate, it could suggest that some tepheline and Mazooza slips were
prepared as early as the Hasmonean period.
The Nash Papyrus
Another significant artifact is the Nash Papyrus, acquired from an Egyptian antiquities
dealer who claimed it was found in the Faim region.
This papyrus primarily contains a harmonized version of the Decalogue from Exodus 20 and
Deuteronomy 5, along with a Hebrew version of Deuteronomy 6-3, which is present in the
Septuagint but missing from the Masoretic text, followed by Deuteronomy 6-4, although
the lower part of the papyrus is missing.
Due to its textual content and physical resemblance to the Qumran tepheline in Mazooza, some scholars
have suggested it might be a tepheline slip or a Mazooza.
The papyrus has been dated paleographically to the mid-second century BCE until the mid-first
century BCE.
If this date and its identification as a tepheline or Mazooza are accurate, both are uncertain.
The Nash Papyrus could represent one of the earliest known artifacts associated with these
practices, evidence before the second century BCE.
No artifacts conclusively connected to tepheline or Mazooza practices predate the second century
BCE, while some scholars have attempted to find potential precursors in various amuletic
practices from the Iron Age in Near East.
These connections are not strong.
The closest resemblance is found in two silver plaques discovered at Khatif Hinom, which
contain apotropaic formulae, similar to the priestly blessings in Numbers 6-24 through
26.
However, beyond their small size and textual similarity, there isn't sufficient reason
to consider these artifacts as early evidence of Judean ritual practices like tepheline
or Mazooza.
The evidence presented in this section supports the existence of tepheline and Mazooza as
Judean ritual practices in the first century CE.
While it's challenging to determine how widespread these practices were, the tepheline remains
from the Judean desert, provide valuable insights into the details of these rituals and their
development.
Different types of tepheline found in the caves suggest that Judean legal experts were actively
debating the finer points of the ritual, shedding light on the development of Torah as a legal
system during this period.
However, evidence for these practices before the first century CE is less certain and dates
back to no earlier than the second century BCE.
There is no evidence of any practice resembling tepheline or Mazooza observance prior to the
middle of the second century BCE.
In contrast to the previous sections, which focused on specific categories of customs
and prohibitions, this section will explore six distinct practices, characterized Judaism
in the first century CE.
These practices are circumcision, observing the Sabbath, participating in the Passover
sacrifice, and the festival of unleavened bread, fasting on the day of atonement, engaging
in the central rites or rituals of the Sukkot festival, dwelling in temporary booths and
using certain plant species, and maintaining a continuously lit seven-branched menorah
in the Jerusalem temple.
In each case, we will examine evidence from the first century CE and then examine earlier
periods, circumcision in the first century CE.
Circumcision is mentioned in the Pentateuch as one of the commandments dating back to
Abraham, with a requirement for every male child to be circumcised on the eighth day.
Valuer to comply with this command carried severe consequences, including being cut off
from the community.
This practice extended not only to infants and purchased slaves, but also to resident
aliens who wished to partake in the Passover sacrifice.
In the writings of first century CE authors, both Jews and non-Jews recognized circumcision
as a prominent marker of all Jewish identity.
For Jewish individuals, it was not just a cultural trait, but a fulfillment of a divine
commandment outlined in the Torah.
Philo and Paul, for instance, referred to circumcision as a commandment of the law.
And Paul argued that it should not be imposed on Gentiles.
Acts mentioned circumcision as part of the custom of Moses, while the Gospel of John
depicted Jesus defending the practice even on the Sabbath.
Josephus recounted an ancient, Josephus recounted an incident where a Gentile king's refusal
to circumcise was seen as a grave offense against God.
For first century CE Jews, circumcision was primarily a commandment of the Torah and its
abandonment was considered a serious legal transgression.
While other groups practiced circumcision during this time, Jews were unique in doing
so based on a statutory law.
Early Evidence of Circumcision
The earliest non-Jewish reference to Jewish circumcision comes from the mid-first century
BCE author, Diodorus Siculus.
Even earlier, Jewish sources mentioned circumcision in the context of the Hasmonean rulers.
Hurricaneus I and Aristobulus I, who enforced circumcision on conquered peoples.
In texts likely dating from the Hasmonean period, circumcision is described in legal
terms in Jubilees.
Theodotus, another writer from this period, cited the story of circumcision in Genesis
34 as a divine mandate.
The practice of circumcision is prominently featured in the narrative surrounding the
reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in I and II Maccabees, with instances of renegade Jews
forsaking circumcision and later forcibly circumcising uncircumcised boys.
Daniel 11 may also allude to entire keen decrees against circumcision, suggesting its prevalence
by this time.
However, it's possible that the Holy Covenant, in this context, refers to broader elements
of the divine covenant such as the people and the temple.
Closer to the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, Ben-Cira emphasized Abraham's obedience
to divine commandments including circumcision, but it's unclear how widespread this belief
was among the Jewish population.
Prior to the 2nd century BCE, there's no evidence outside of the Pentateuch for the
idea of circumcision as a fulfillment of divine command, a legally mandated practice, or its
association with a legal framework.
Circumcision was likely a cultural practice among early Israelites, but it may have predated
any distinct Israelite identity and was later incorporated into Pentateuchal legislation.
Sabbath prohibitions in the 1st century.
In the ancient Jewish tradition, the 7th day of the week known as the Sabbath was a day
of rest, and it was prohibited to engage in any form of work.
While the foundational texts like the Pentateuch mentioned this prohibition, they only provided
a few specific examples of what activities were forbidden, such as plowing, reaping,
kindling fire, gathering wood, and leaving one's place.
By the 1st century CE, the observance of Sabbath prohibitions had become a defining feature
of Jewish life.
Both among Jewish communities and non-Jewish observers throughout the Mediterranean region,
Jewish writers of that time grappled with questions about what exactly constituted work
that should be avoided on the Sabbath, and under what circumstances exceptions could
be made.
For instance, the philosopher Philo extensively discussed the symbolic and ethical significance
of observing the Sabbath, emphasizing the importance of following the practical laws
associated with it.
He criticized those who focused solely on the symbolic aspects, while neglecting the
actual observance of Sabbath laws, such as lighting fires, working the land, carrying
heavy loads, conducting legal proceedings, and other activities that were generally considered
prohibited.
Philo's writings suggest that most Jews took the observance of the Sabbath laws seriously,
and even the Roman Emperor Augustus respected Jewish Sabbath practices, ensuring that the
distribution of financial assistance in Rome would not occur on Saturdays, when Sabbath
observance was at its strictest.
Philo also recounted a story about a governor in Egypt who attempted to compel Jewish residents
to work on the Sabbath, but this met with widespread resistance and outrage among the
Jewish community.
In the New Testament Gospels, stories about the Sabbath shed light on the boundaries of
Sabbath prohibitions.
Jesus, for example, was said to permit healing on the Sabbath, and defended his followers
who engaged in activities like plucking grain or carrying a mat on the Sabbath.
However, he also recognized certain activities as universally permissible on the Sabbath,
including the temple rituals, rescuing individuals or animals in need, and circumcision.
The prohibition against working on the Sabbath is also discussed in the writings of Josephus,
particularly in the context of military activities.
Josephus grappled with the question of when it was permissible to break the Sabbath for
warfare, and his experiences as a commander during the great revolt likely influenced his
views.
Josephus also mentioned the prohibition against traveling on the Sabbath and described a debate
between the Essenes and other Jews about the strictness of Sabbath observance.
Finally, various non-Jewish sources from the first century mentioned Jewish Sabbath observance,
often in a critical or derogatory manner.
This widespread awareness of Jewish Sabbath practices among non-Jews underscores the significance
and prevalence of Sabbath observance during that time.
A recent study examined Sabbath observance among the small Jewish community in Edfu,
Egypt during the first century CE.
The study found that while regular taxes were sometimes collected from Jews on the Sabbath,
the special Judean tax imposed after the great revolt was almost never collected on a Sabbath.
This suggests that regular tax collection was handled by non-Jews, while Jews themselves
refrained from collecting the Judean tax on the Sabbath.
Earlier evidence of Sabbath observance and prohibitions, we have substantial historical
evidence from the first and second centuries BCE that shows the widespread observance
of Sabbath prohibitions within the Judean community.
These prohibitions specified what activities were not allowed on the Sabbath day, which
was the seventh day of the week.
However, during this period, there were debates and discussions among various individuals
and groups regarding the exact rules and boundaries of these Sabbath laws.
In the first century BCE, the historian Josephus mentioned several letters and decrees issued
by Roman officials.
These directives instructed cities across the Mediterranean region to grant the local
Judean communities the freedom to practice their Sabbath laws without interference.
Some of the activities explicitly mentioned as forbidden on the Sabbath included legal
proceedings like appearing in court, carrying weapons, and military marching.
Josephus also recounted that during Pompey's attack on Jerusalem in 63 BCE, the Roman general
took advantage of the Sabbath to build fortifications around the city, as Judeans typically only
fought in self-defense on that day.
These Sabbath prohibitions were not only present in historical records, but also appeared in
text dating from the last two centuries BCE.
For example, the Book of Jubilees listed specific actions that were prohibited on the Sabbath,
such as moving items between houses, preparing food and drink, traveling by ship or animal,
hunting, slaughtering animals, engaged in warfare, having sexual intercourse, and even
discussing work-related matters.
The Damascus document provided further details on Sabbath prohibitions, including activities
forbidden from Friday afternoon when the sun reached a certain point in the sky.
These restrictions ranged from refraining from empty or disgraceful speech to not demanding
payments from neighbors and much more.
The writer Aristobulus from the mid-2nd century BCE emphasized the importance of the Seventh
Day as a day of rest mandated by Judean law.
He believed that observing the Sabbath was a way to gain knowledge of both human and
divine matters.
The books of 1st and 2nd Maccabees contain stories illustrating the complexities surrounding
Sabbath observance.
In some cases, devout Judeans chose not to fight in self-defense on the Sabbath, even
when attacked.
However, there were instances when they decided that self-defense on the Sabbath was necessary
to ensure their survival.
The earliest non-Judean references to Judean Sabbath observance came from Agatharsides.
The earliest non-Judean reference to Judean Sabbath observance came from Agatharchides
of Nidus in the mid-2nd century BCE, who described the Judean custom of abstaining from work on
the Seventh Day.
This concept of Judeans observing Sabbath prohibitions became a common theme among Greek
and Latin authors from the 1st century BC onwards.
One interesting historical artifact is a papyrus from the 3rd century BCE known as the Zenon
papyri, which mentions the term Sabbath in the context of a day when certain individuals
were framed from work.
Whether this referred to a traditional Judean holiday or a weekly Sabbath observance is not
entirely clear.
While there are accounts of Sabbath observance in these historical sources, it is important
to note that the idea of Sabbath prohibitions was not widely practiced or known before the
2nd century BCE.
The Hebrew Bible contains very few narratives about Judeans refraining from certain activities
on the Sabbath, and the concept of the Seventh Day Week itself was not commonly used for
timekeeping until the late 2nd century BCE.
It wasn't until the mid-2nd century BCE that we see a significant shift towards widespread
observance of Sabbath prohibitions among Judeans.
Prior to this, there is little evidence to suggest that the general population was aware
of or adhering to such prohibitions.
Passover in the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the 1st century CE.
In the Book of Exodus, Chapter 12, we find instructions from Yahweh, the Hebrew God,
to Moses and Aaron regarding the observance of Passover on the eve of the Israelites
Exodus from Egypt.
These instructions include selecting a one-year-old male lamb or kid on the 10th day of the first
month, slaughtering it on the 14th day, marking the doorpost of the house with its blood,
and then eating the roasted meat along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs on the same
night.
Yahweh emphasizes that this Passover sacrifice should be observed for all generations as an
ongoing ordinance.
Detailed guidelines are provided on various aspects of the ritual, such as who should perform
it, how it should be done, what should be done with the leftovers.
Additionally, instructions are given in the other parts of the Pentateuch, including allowances
for impure individuals or those on distant journeys.
Connected to the Passover sacrifice is the Festival of Unleavened Bread, lasting seven
days from the 15th to the 21st day of the first month.
In this festival, leaven and leavened bread are prohibited, and unleavened bread is to
be consumed.
The first and last days of the festival are designated as holy convocations when no work
is to be done.
Detailed instructions about special sacrifices and libations during this period are provided
in Numbers 28, 19 through 24.
Historical evidence suggests that both the Passover sacrifice and the Festival of Unleavened
Bread were widely practiced by Judeans in the first century CE.
Philo, a Jewish philosopher of that time, described the Passover rituals mentioning
that many myriads of sacrifices were offered from noon until evening, involving people
of all ages, not just priests.
He also noted that every household resembled a temple during this time.
While Philo may have been describing practices in Judaism, some believe he could have been
referencing practices in Alexandria.
Josephus, a historian at that time as well, reported a massive census during the Passover
season where 255,600 animals were slaughtered for the Passover sacrifice.
He estimated that over two and a half million participants were involved, including Judeans
from abroad.
These accounts support Philo's description of widespread Passover observance.
The synoptic Gospels also highlight the importance of Passover.
Jesus and his disciples observed a Passover meal, where bread and hymns were part of the
celebration.
This suggests that Passover observance was common among contemporary Judeans.
Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread appear as prominent events in Gospel counts
and in Acts, marking significant dates in the Judean calendar.
The prohibition against leaving, the prohibition against leaven during this feast, was also
known among non-Judeans, as indicated by the historian Tacitus, who mentioned the use
of unleavened Judean bread in memory of their hasty departure from Egypt.
In 4 BCE, during the Passover and Festival of Unleavened Bread, a significant gathering
of Jewish people took place in Jerusalem, involving numerous animal sacrifices.
This event was mentioned by historian Josephus, however, this account lacks the details needed
to determine whether it's accurately reflecting practices from the mid-1st century BCE.
During the Hasmonean period, there is limited information about the observance of Passover-related
practices.
Some texts mention details about Passover and unleavened bread laws, but they do not
provide a clear picture of how widespread these observances were during that time.
On the other hand, certain legal texts from the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE offer valuable
insights into how Judean scholars were interpreting and applying the Pentateuchal laws to establish
specific rules for these festivals.
For example, the Book of Jubilees specifies when and where the Passover should be observed
and who should participate.
These texts also suggest age and gender restrictions.
Before the 2nd century BCE, the Hebrew Bible is the primary source of information regarding
practices resembling the Passover sacrifice and the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
Some narratives in the Bible describe large-scale Passover observances, but the historical
accuracy of these accounts is uncertain.
The lack of concrete evidence has led to various theories about the origins of these festivals,
with most hypotheses suggesting the existence of two distinct springtime agricultural or
shepherding festivals that eventually merged into the Passover and unleavened bread.
However, these theories are largely speculative and lack substantiated evidence.
The earliest solid evidence for widespread observance of the Passover and the Festival
of Unleavened Bread comes from Josephus' accounts of events that occurred at the Temple
Mount in the 1st century BCE and CE.
While some Hasmonean-era texts indicate scholarly engagement with the festival's laws, the
extent of practical observance during that time remains uncertain.
Biblical narratives provide insights into how the festivals were envisioned by individual
writers but not offer concrete evidence of their widespread practice.
The epigraphic material from Elephantine provides some evidence of Passover observance, but lacks
sufficient detail to draw definitive conclusions about its alignment with penitugal regulations.
During Passover at Elephantine
In our investigation, we come across intriguing mentions of Passover in ancient Elephantine,
specifically two letters inscribed on pieces of pottery known as Ostraca, allude to Passover-related
matters.
The first letter, addressed to someone named Hoshaya, contains a request for information
about when Passover would be observed.
However, it does not provide any details about the nature of this Passover observance, and
it hints that the date for Passover may not have been fixed.
The second Ostracon, though fragmented, contains a request suggesting an individual's intention
to participate in the Passover observance.
Again, it lacks specifics about the nature of this Passover celebration.
It appears that Passover may have been a subject of interest or discussion among the community,
but the exact customs and rituals associated with it remain unclear.
A third letter written on Papyrus does not mention Passover explicitly, but refers to
a period between the 15th and 21st days of a month, potentially Nisan, which aligns
with the timeframe of the Biblical Festival of Unleavened Bread.
However, this letter is also vague, providing no details about the observed practices during
this period.
Scholars have attempted to interpret these fragments, assuming they relate to Passover
and the Festival of Unleavened Bread based on the timing mentioned.
They have drawn on Biblical and rabbinic sources to reconstruct missing parts of the text and
clarify unclear phrases.
For example, they have inferred instructions related to the observance of Passover on the
14th day of Nisan, eating unleavened bread for seven days, maintaining ritual purity,
refraining from work on specific days, avoiding leavened products, and removing leaven from
households.
However, it is crucial to note that these reconstructions heavily rely on later Biblical
and rabbinic sources.
Scholars have applied these known practices to the Elephantine texts, and in doing so,
they risk circular reasoning.
In other words, the interpretations and reconstructions are based on the same sources they seek to
validate, making it challenging to establish independent evidence.
The Elephantine texts offer tantalizing hints, Passover observance, and the Festival of Unleavened
Bread.
But they lack explicit details.
Any attempt to reconstruct these practices relies heavily on later religious texts and
regulations, which can lead to circular reasoning.
While these ancient texts shed light on the cultural context of Elephantine, they do
not provide definitive evidence of Passover customs as practiced at that time.
The Day of Atonement Fast, Evidence from the First Century
In ancient times, there was a significant religious observance known as the Day of Atonement.
This special day was mandated in the Pentateuch, which is the first five books of the Hebrew
Bible again.
It occurred on the 10th day of the 7th month and was considered the Sabbath of Sabbaths.
On this day, people were forbidden from working, and they were required to engage in some form
of self-torment, described as afflicting yourselves.
The consequences for not observing this self-affliction were severe, as one could be cut off from their
people.
The purpose of the Day of Atonement was to purify the people of their sins before the
Deity Yahweh, making it a significant religious occasion.
By the first century CE, it seems that there was consensus among Jewish population that
the self-affliction mentioned in the Pentateuch should be carried out through fasting.
This practice was widespread and well documented.
Bilo, a Jewish philosopher, wrote about it, highlighting that even those who were not
known for their piety observed the fast on the 10th day.
Similarly, Josephus, a Jewish historian, referred to this day as a universal fast to honor God.
The author of the biblical book of Acts also mentioned the fast as a common reference,
indicating its familiarity to the readers.
The Day of Atonement was not only known within Jewish community, but also recognized by Greek
and Latin authors, although some of them confused it with the weekly Sabbath.
Early evidence from the first century BCE and later suggests that the Day of Atonement
fast was practiced during this period.
For instance, Josephus recounted an incident involving a high priest named Matthias, who
was temporarily replaced on the day before the fast due to dream-related issue.
This story suggests that the fast was observed around the end of the first century BCE.
Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Peshir Habakkuk text is the earliest surviving reference to
the fast on the Day of Atonement.
It tells of a conflict between two individuals on that holy day, mentioning the fasting aspect.
While the exact date of this text's composition is uncertain, it likely dates back to this
period.
The Damascus document also hints at a Day of the Fast, likely referring to the Day of
Atonement, though it is not explicitly stated.
Several other texts from the Hasmonean period mention the Day of Atonement, but do not explicitly
mention fasting.
Interestingly, prior to the Hasmonean period, there is no documented evidence of the Day
of Atonement outside of the Pentateuch.
Several biblical texts from the Persian period and later show no awareness of such a holiday.
For example, Solomon's dedication of the altar and the Sukkot Festival in Second Chronicles,
the rediscovery of Sukkot in Nehemiah, and the construction of an altar in Ezra make
no mention of the Day of Atonement.
The practice of an annual fast on the Day of Atonement was widespread among Jews in
the first century CE as evidenced in various sources.
However, prior to the Hasmonean period, this holiday and its fasting components were not
attested outside of the Pentateuch.
Again, some biblical texts from later periods also lack any mention of the Day of Atonement,
suggesting that it was not universally known among all Jewish writers during those times.
Sukkot, Booths, and the Four Species Evidence from the First Century.
The Festival of Sukkot, also known as the Festival of Booths or the Festival of In-Gathering,
is a significant autumnal event mentioned several times in the Pentateuch, the first
five books in the Hebrew Bible.
Two unique practices associated with Sukkot are explained in Leviticus 2340, 42-43.
The first practice involves taking the fruit of a majestic tree, branches of palm trees,
a leafy tree's bow, and willows of the brook.
The second practice is dwelling in the booths, temporary structures, for seven days.
These practices are intended to commemorate the Israelites' time and booths when they
were brought out of Egypt.
In the first instruction, it's not entirely clear what should be done with the mentioned
floral elements after they are taken.
The second instruction involves residing in booths, suggesting the construction of some
temporary shelters.
Historical records suggest that these practices were observed by Judeans in the First Century
CE.
Phylo, writing around 38 CE, mentioned that Judeans in Alexandria celebrated the festival
by living in booths.
Josephus, a Jewish historian from the same period, described the custom of building
booths during Sukkot as widespread among Judeans.
He also mentioned the practice of taking the four species, including the citron, palm
branches, myrtle, and willow during the festival.
The use of these four species was described in detail by Josephus, clarifying certain
aspects of the Pentateuchal instructions.
He explained that the citron represented the fruit of the majestic tree, myrtle was the
leafy tree, and the three leafy species were to be bound together as a wand, bouquet, and
held with the citron.
The importance of the four species in Sukkot is further emphasized by their presence on
bronze coins, meant during the Great Revolt in 69-70 CE.
These coins featured variations of the four species motif, highlighting the symbolic value
of these practices.
Plutarch, a writer from the late First Century CE, also mentioned the Judean customs during
Sukkot, including living in booths and carrying branches, although he mixed details from different
autumnal festivals.
Earlier evidence, evidence for the central Sukkot rituals, residing in booths and carrying
the four species, can be traced back to as early as the last two centuries BCE.
Although the evidence is limited and somewhat problematic, for instance a rebellion against
Alexander Jenaeus in the early First Century BCE involved pelting the king with citrons
during the festival of booths, indicating that this practice was in place at that time.
Just from the Hasmonean period, such as the Book of Jubilees and the Temple Scroll, provide
more reliable evidence of how these rituals were understood and practiced.
Jubilees describes Abraham celebrating Sukkot by building booths, offering sacrifices and
carrying branches.
The Temple Scroll prescribes the construction of booths on the roofs of certain buildings
in the temple's outer court during Sukkot.
The author of Second Maccabees also mentioned a celebration resembling Sukkot, where Judas
Maccabees and his men carried wands, beautiful branches and palm fronds in a procession.
However, this event occurred at a different time and the items carried did not precisely
match those listed in Leviticus 2340.
Before the Second Century BCE, the only evidence of the central Sukkot rituals is found in
Nehemiah 813-18.
This passage mentions collecting various foliage to build booths and recalls a commandment from
Moses regarding Sukkot observance.
However, it's unclear whether these rituals were widely practiced at the time.
Evidence for the observance of Sukkot rituals, including dwelling in booths and carrying
the four species, becomes more substantial from the Hasminian period onward, with limited
evidence suggesting their practice in earlier times.
The Nehemiah passage provides early evidence but doesn't necessarily confirm widespread
observance.
The Seven Branched Menorah evidence from the First Century CE.
The Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, includes instructions for the
construction of a golden lamp stand called Menorah with seven branches.
This Menorah is decorated with stylized cups, calluses, and flower petals, and it is to
be placed in the tabernacle with its lamps continuously lit.
During the First Century CE, there is strong evidence that a Menorah closely following
these Pentateuchal instructions was indeed present in the Jerusalem Temple.
Josephus, who was a Jerusalem priest and eyewitness, provided a detailed description of the Menorah.
He also reported that when the temple was destroyed in 70, the Romans took the Menorah
among the spoils and displayed it in Rome's Temple of Peace.
The famous boss relief on the Ark of Titus corroborates Josephus' account depicting the
Menorah carried by the Romans.
Recent studies using spectroscopy have confirmed that the Menorah was originally depicted as
golden on this relief.
The commandment regarding the Menorah was not limited to the physical artifact in the temple.
It also influenced the consciousness of lay Judeans living outside the temple's direct
influence.
Josephus described the setting up and continual lighting of the Menorah as obedience to the
law, suggesting that regular Judeans would have learned about these laws when relevant
Pentateuchal passages were publicly read in Titan synagogues.
Archaeological artifacts from the First Century CE, including sundials, ossuaries, vessels,
reliefs, oil lamps, and graffiti, feature depictions of the Menorah.
Studies suggest that awareness of the Menorah ritual mandated by Toro Law was widespread
among 1st century Judeans.
Earlier evidence.
The awareness of the Temple Menorah in the mid 1st century BCE is supported by numismatic
evidence.
Matathias Antigonus, a historical figure from this period, featured a depiction of the Seven
Branch Menorah on one of his bronze coins you can see right now.
There are also historical accounts that mention the Temple Menorah, such as Pompey's encounter
with the Sacred Lampstand upon entering the sanctuary, and Antiochus IV's removal of
the Lampstand of Light, which was later replaced by Judas Maccabeus Men.
These accounts, however, do not provide a detailed description of the Menorah's appearance.
The Hebrew Bible outside of the Pentateuch mentions Lampstands in Solomon's Temple,
but these references lack descriptions and do not necessarily align with the Pentateuchal
Menorah.
Only the book of Zechariah describes a seven lamp golden lampstand with a bowl, seven lips,
and two olive trees.
This vision is not directly connected to the Jerusalem Temple Menorah.
During the first century CE, there is strong evidence that the Temple Menorah closely followed
Pentateuchal instructions.
However, before the mid first century BCE, there is limited evidence for the appearance
and awareness of the Seven Branch Menorah, with some references lacking detailed descriptions
or clear connections to the Pentateuchal Menorah, concluding these various practices in this
entire section.
We explored various customs and practices that were significant aspects of the way of
life for people in Judea during the first century CE.
We looked at how circumcision was a widespread practice among Judeans during this time, serving
not only as a marker of their identity, but also as a central commandment of the Torah,
their religious text.
Sabbath laws were also commonly observed by Judeans both in Judea and across the Mediterranean
world.
These laws, which governed activities on the Sabbath day, were subject to discussion and
debate among Torah scholars.
Additionally, historical evidence indicates that the Passover sacrifice, the Festival
of Unleavened Bread, and the Day of Atonement were all observed by Judeans on a large scale
during this period.
The main ritual for the Day of Atonement involved fasting, practice, universally recognized
among first century Judeans.
Moreover, the ritual associated with the festival Sukkot, such as residing in temporary booths
and using specific plant species, were widely practiced.
Finally, a Seven Branch Menorah, as prescribed by Torah law, was unquestionably present in
the Temple during the first century CE, and both text and archaeological discoveries confirmed
that Judeans of that era were aware of its existence and appearance.
All of these aspects of first century Judaism have some evidence dating back to the first
century BCE, and in some cases, the second century BCE.
However, there is no clear evidence of these practices before this period.
Circumcision, for example, was considered a requirement by Torah law as early as the
second century BCE, but there is no evidence outside the Torah suggesting that it was practiced
as a divine commandment or legally mandated before that time.
Similarly, Sabbath observance can be traced back to the second century BCE, but there is
no reliable evidence indicating that the concept of certain activities being forbidden on the
Sabbath day was widely known or observed among the Judean population before then.
The extent to which Passover, the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and the Day of Atonement
were observed in the last two centuries BCE is not well documented.
Before this period, there is little evidence to gauge the extent of these rituals, observances,
or even awareness.
The same applies to the Day of Atonement, which is unattested before the Hasmonean period,
and there is no evidence of it outside the Pentateuch in earlier Biblical sources.
Regarding the practices associated with Sukkot, residing in booths and taking the Four Species,
there is some evidence dating back to the last two centuries BCE, but it is difficult
to determine how widely they were observed by the general population.
Before the second century BCE, the only evidence of these rituals is found in a single passage
in Nehemiah, which may be more of an idealized depiction than an accurate reflection of the
practices of the time.
Lastly, the Seventh Branch Menorah is documented as early as the first century BCE, but it
is absent from ancient Judean art and earlier text outside of the Torah before that period.
All the practices we have examined in this section characterize Judaism in the first
century CE and have some historical evidence dating back to the first century BCE, and in
some cases, second century BCE.
However, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that these practices were commonly
observed or widely known before the second century BCE.
This challenges the idea that these practices became widespread during the Babylonian exile
and the early days of the return design.
The Bible indicates that, or at least says that this is what they did.
No archaeological evidence backs that up.
While these practices are present in certain sections of the Torah, it is important not
to confuse the date of a document's composition with the time when it gained widespread acceptance
and authority among ordinary Judeans.
The evidence we've examined does not support the notion that these practices were commonly
observed as early as the Babylonian or Persian periods.
The Synagogue
We're shifting our focus to something different from our previous topics.
The synagogue, unlike the practices and rules governed by Torah law that we've explored
before, the synagogue isn't explicitly mentioned in the Torah.
However, by the first century CE, it had become a central institution for Judeans,
second only to the Jerusalem Temple.
Its significance lies in its role as the primary means of spreading the Torah, which
is crucial for understanding the development and spread of Judaism.
So to investigate the origins of Judaism, we need to look at when evidence for the synagogue
first appears.
The question of how and why the synagogue came into existence has been widely discussed,
but I'll focus on a more specific aspect in this section.
Like in the previous chapters, I'll start by describing what the synagogue looked like
in the first century CE based on the evidence from that time.
Turns out, the synagogue primarily served as an educational center.
Local Judean communities would gather there weekly to hear the public reading of the Pentateuch,
the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, possibly along with other sacred texts.
This reading was followed by an oral explanation or learned.
This reading was followed by an oral explanation or learned discussion.
Files show that synagogues were prevalent, not only in Judea, but also among Judean communities
and other regions.
Thus, the synagogue played a crucial role in spreading the Torah among Judeans.
Once we understand how synagogues function in the first century, we'll delve into the
earliest available evidence for something similar to a synagogues in the centuries leading
up to the first century.
Textual First Century Evidence Here's some of the first century textual evidence
for the existence and function of synagogues, which were crucial institutions in Judean
communities at the time.
Philo, a prominent thinker of the era, frequently referenced to places where Judeans gathered
for communal activities.
He used the terms place of prayer or place of assembly to describe these places, essentially
what we now call synagogues.
According to Philo, these gatherings were organized to ensure that Judeans had a deep
understanding of their ancestral laws and customs, mainly through the weekly reading
of the sacred laws.
This practice involved both reading from the Pentateuch and providing oral explanations
to help people grasp the finer points of the laws.
Philo's description highlights that synagogues served as educational centers, aiming to disseminate
knowledge of the Torah widely among the Judean population.
In the New Testament, particularly the Gospels and Acts, they also frequently mentioned synagogues.
They depict Judeans gathering in synagogues primarily on the Sabbath, emphasizing the
educational aspect of these institutions.
For instance, Jesus and Paul are often portrayed as visiting synagogues to teach.
In these narratives, the synagogues setting involves reading from sacred texts, followed
by oral explanations or discussions.
The Gospel of James even suggests that this Torah education happened every Sabbath in
synagogues across various cities.
Josephus, of course another historical source, reinforces the idea of synagogues as centers
for Torah education.
He mentions how Moses instituted the regular assembly of Judeans to hear and deeply understand
the law, applying both reading and detailed learning.
Josephus asserted, this system was so effective that every Judean knew the laws by heart.
In addition to education, Philo also mentioned that synagogues were used for collecting annual
first fruits to be sent to Jerusalem Temple for sacrifices.
Furthermore, various sources suggest that synagogues sometimes served as venues for
corporal punishment, almsgiving, and prayer.
Although these activities didn't define the institution's primary purpose, evidence
from Philo, the New Testament, and Josephus paints a coherent picture of first century
synagogues.
These institutions were widespread in Judean communities, both in their homeland and the
diaspora.
Their main function was education, with regular gatherings for the reading and oral explanation
of the Torah and other sacred texts.
Additionally, synagogues occasionally hosted other communal activities.
This educational and communal role was central to the identity and purpose of synagogues
in the first century CE, epigraphic and archaeological clues.
When we delve into the ancient past, we encounter various inscriptions that shed light on the
religious gatherings of Judeans in the first century CE.
These inscriptions are like historical snapshots, offering glimpses into a world long gone.
One particularly significant find, known as the Theodotus inscription, carries vital
information about the nature of these gatherings during that era.
Discovered in a water cistern in the southeastern part of Jerusalem, the city of David, during
excavations in the early 20th century, this Greek inscription, etched on a rectangular
limestone slab, was uncovered amidst debris from the destruction of 70 CE.
It was crafted sometime in the late 1st century BCE, or early 1st century CE.
The inscription serves as a commemoration of the founding of a synagogue, and starts
by stating its purpose.
Theodotus, son of Vatinos, priest and archa-synagogus, son of an archa-synagogus, grandson of an
archa-synagogus, built the synagogue for the reading of the law and teaching of the commandments.
This inscription aligns with what ancient authors of the first century repeatedly emphasized.
It directly confirms that primary activities conducted within the synagogue, the reading
of the law, and the teaching of the commandments.
What stands out most is the inscription's assertion that the dissemination of the Torah
to the public was the fundamental reason behind the constructing of synagogues.
Additional inscriptions from the 1st century CE offer valuable evidence regarding the widespread
presence of synagogues.
This inscription, dating to 55 CE, and discovered in Baranis, records the names of numerous donors
who contributed to the restoration of their community synagogue, another inscription from
an unidentified location in Egypt, and dating to the 1st or 2nd century CE commemorates
an individual who built a place of prayer for themselves, their spouse, and children.
In Acmonia, the local Judean community honored a non-Judean aristocrat named Julia Severa
for her role in constructing a building.
This inscription also mentions an archon and two synagogue heads who contributed to the
restoration and beautification of the structure.
From the Bosporus region, which was a vassal kingdom under Roman control at the time, we
have discovered eight inscriptions referencing Judean communities and their communal buildings,
all dating to the 1st and 2nd century CE.
These inscriptions typically concern the manumission freeing of slaves with the procedure taking
place in the place of prayer.
The Judean community would assume legal responsibility for the freed individuals who in turn were
expected to continue attending the place of prayer regularly.
These findings collectively provide valuable insight into the historical context of Judean
religious life during this period.
In the realm of archaeology, our journey into understanding 1st century CE synagogues begins
with a discovery at Masada during Yegal Yadin's excavations from 1963 to 1965.
What emerged was the structure measuring roughly 15 by 12 meters, featuring a primary hall with
a smaller room protruding from its northern corner.
Four tiers of benches lined, the interior walls of the main hall, and a single bench
abuted the wall of the northern room.
This building had once been supported by five columns.
Its substantial size suggested it was a public edifice, while the benches clearly indicated
its function as an assembly hall capable of accommodating its sizable gathering.
However, what definitively confirmed it as a synagogue were the remnants of scrolls from
the books of Deuteronomy and Ezekiel discovered in two pits dug into the floor of the northern
room.
Since the Masada finds several similar structures from the 1st century CE had been identified
as synagogues through excavations at various locations, including Gamla Magdala with two
buildings, Tal Rakesh, Kerbet Diyab, Kiryat Sefer, Um El Umdan, Herodium, and Kerbet
Atwani.
Forgive me if I butchered some of these names, but you saw them on the screen.
In all these cases, the excavated structures were considered public buildings due to their
size and the presence of benches along their interior walls.
There are strong grounds to associate these buildings at Masada and elsewhere with the
institution described in the literary sources we've examined.
Setting aside these texts for a moment, let's consider how we might interpret such structures
purely from an archaeological standpoint.
Even excavating a similar building in China, Ireland, or Peru, a spacious area encircled
by benches, our functional analysis would likely conclude that this space was intended
for gatherings.
The seating arrangement would suggest that the center of the room was the focal point
where everyone seated faced and participants could easily see, hear, and communicate with
each other.
An archaeologist encountering such a structure would likely label it an assembly hall or
a meeting house.
It wouldn't matter where in the world or what historical period it belonged to, the
functional interpretation would remain similar.
When these types of buildings are unearthed in Judean sites dating to the 1st century
CE, we could take an additional step.
The contemporary literary sources we've examined refer to a Judean institution centered around
an assembly hall, the synagogue.
In Greek, one of the primary names for this institution, synagogue, literally means place
of assembly.
In Hebrew and Aramaic, it translates to house of assembly.
These texts mention the institution and Judean communities of various sizes across the southern
Levant, a match with archaeological assembly halls.
Additionally, none of these literary sources report any other common Judean institution
that fits the description of these archaeological assembly halls.
Using Occam's razor, the simplest explanation is that the assembly halls discovered through
archaeology are indeed the synagogues described in the literary sources.
This argument gains further support from the fortunate discovery of fragments of Deuteronomy
and Ezekiel scrolls in the Masada building, while Yadin's idea that the room served as
a Ghaniza annex is somewhat anachronistic.
It seems more than coincidental that these artifacts, central to synagogue activities,
were found within the walls of a 1st century Judean assembly hall.
If we accept these fragments strongly endorse the identification of the Masada structure
as a synagogue, then buildings at other sites resembling the Masada one should, by analogy,
also be rightfully considered synagogues.
A wealth of evidence, literary, epigraphic, and archaeological, paints a picture of the
1st century synagogue as an institution primarily dedicated to disseminating the Torah and related
sacred texts through public readings and oral lectures during gatherings of local Judean
communities.
While variations may have existed from one community to another, this broad strokes depiction
likely represents a common institution among Judean communities worldwide.
Besides the Jerusalem temple, no other institution seems to have played a more central role
in the communal life of Judeans during this time.
Early evidence for synagogue-like institutions.
As we seek to uncover the earliest evidence resembling the institution of the synagogue
as defined in the 1st century CE, we turn to both literary and physical sources, epigraphic,
aprological, and archaeological.
Textual evidence from Philo and Josephus.
Philo, the historian, stated that during the reign of Augustus, multiple places of prayer
existed in Rome where the city's Judeans would assemble, particularly on sacred Sabbaths
for communal study of their ancestral philosophy.
Philo claimed that Augustus sanctioned these gatherings and even sent letters to provincial
governors in Asia, instructing them to allow Judeans to assemble in synagogues.
However, these claims come from Philo's embassy to Gaius and are presented in an apologetic
context raising doubts about their accuracy.
Josephus also cited a letter from Augustus to the provincial governors of Asia ordering
severe consequences for those caught stealing sacred books or money from a Sabbath Hall or
a banquet hall.
This Sabbath Hall is likely a synagogue where sacred books and money were stored before
being sent to Jerusalem.
The term banquet hall is more ambiguous and it has been suggested that it might refer
to a Torah Ark.
Josephus' citation of this letter is also in an apologetic context casting doubt on
its authenticity.
These accounts by Philo and Josephus describe an institution that resembles the first century
CE synagogue, primarily dedicated to the communal gatherings for the public reading
and teaching of Torah, but their apologetic context warrants caution.
Additionally, Josephus referred to a speech by Nicholas of Damascus who mentioned that
Judeans dedicating every seventh day to the study of their customs and laws.
If these accounts are not anachronistic, they provide some of the earliest literary evidence
for the existence of synagogue-like institutions in the mid to late first century CE.
Before Augustus, Josephus mentioned three instances of Judean communal institutions
which may or may not have functioned like synagogues.
In one case, plunder taken from the Jerusalem temple by Antiochus IV in the early 2nd century
BCE was returned to the Judeans of Antioch to be stored in their synagogue.
However, it is unclear how this synagogue functioned under later cell-use rulers.
In another instance, Josephus cited a decree from the people of Halakhanarsus permitting
the local Judean community to build places of prayer near the sea.
In the nature of activities in these houses remains unclear.
Lastly, Josephus mentioned a decree from the people of Sardis allowing Judeans to gather
with their families for ancestral prayers and sacrifices with a place designated for
this purpose.
However, this differs from the known practices of the 1st century CE synagogue.
Dead Sea Scrolls The Dead Sea Scrolls, while rich in historical
content, do not contain references to a house of assembly resembling a synagogue.
The closest reference to regular public readings of Torah in the community rule 1QS, which
prescribes nightly study sessions involving reading from the book, studying the law, and
offering blessings.
However, this occurs on a nightly basis and does not necessarily suggest the presence
of synagogues outside the sectarian community.
Apocrypha, pseudopigrapha, and the Hebrew Aramaic Bible, there is no mention of a building or
institution resembling a synagogue.
The earliest evidence for synagogue-like institutions is found in the accounts of Philo and Josephus
during the reign of Augustus.
Although these accounts are presented in an apologetic context, there are also some vague
references to Judean communal institutions before Augustus.
The nature of these institutions is less clear.
The Dead Sea Scrolls, Apocrypha, pseudopigrapha, and the Hebrew Aramaic Bible do not provide
direct evidence for synagogue or synagogue-like institutions.
Earlier Archaeological Evidence The evidence for the existence of synagogue-like
institutions before the first century CE is indeed sparse and often subject to interpretation
and debate.
Here are some key points from the epigraphic and archaeological evidence discussed.
Dedicatory Inscriptions Several dedicatory inscriptions in Egypt dating
to the Ptolemaic era mention a place of prayer.
These inscriptions date as early as 246 to 221 BCE.
While these inscriptions are among the earliest pieces of evidence, they do not provide detailed
information about the functioning of these early institutions referred to as places of
prayer.
Paparological Evidence Some papyri from Egypt make references to
Judean House of Prayer.
For example, one papyrus mentions a dispute related to a cloak and mentions a Judean place
of prayer in Alexandro Nisos.
Another papyrus from Crocodilopolis mentions a Judean place of prayer, but it remains
unclear how the building was used.
A papyrus fragment hints at a meeting in a House of Prayer associated with an association,
but the document is too fragmentary to provide detailed insights.
Archaeological Evidence The Um El Umdan synagogue is one of the
earliest synagogue buildings identified with an earlier Hasmonean phase dated to the late
2nd or early 1st century BCE.
The identification of a building on Delos, GD 80, as a synagogue from this early period
is subject of debate among scholars.
Here are some of the interpretations and challenges.
The term Proceke was used in Ptolemaic era inscriptions in Egypt, but it is unclear how closely these
early institutions resembled the 1st century CE synagogue.
It is possible that the term Proceke originally referred to an institution focused primarily
on prayer, and over time the function evolved into what we recognize as the synagogue in
the 1st century.
While there are some references to early synagogues, their exact nature and function in these earlier
periods remain uncertain.
While there are references to institutions resembling synagogues in earlier periods,
the evidence is often ambiguous and does not provide a clear picture of how these institutions
functioned before the 1st century CE.
The development of the synagogue, as it is known in the 1st century CE, appears to have
been a gradual process, and the terminology used in earlier periods may not necessarily
reflect the same institution.
The Origins of Judaism Reappraised
We have been examining the customs and rules laid out in the Torah, which by the 1st century
CE had become an integral part of mainstream Judaism.
Our goal has been to find evidence both in texts and physical artifacts, indicating whether
these practices and rules were followed by ordinary Jewish people in the centuries leading
up to the 1st century.
In every instance, we discovered the evidence only goes back as far as the 2nd century BCE
at the earliest.
In the last chapter, we found that the earliest evidence of regular Jewish gatherings and
synagogues to read and interpret the Torah collectively dates to the 2nd or even the
1st century BCE.
This evidence strongly suggests that the 2nd century BCE is the earliest point at which
the Torah began to spread widely among the Jewish population and to be accepted as authoritative
law.
In simpler terms, the Judaism we discussed in this book likely emerged in the middle
of the 2nd century BCE or earlier.
Now in this chapter, we want to go beyond the data-driven boundary and explore when
it most likely that the Torah was adopted as authoritative law among the Jewish population.
We will start by investigating the possibility that this happened as early as the Persian
period, a notion that many scholars have assumed in the past.
As we discussed in the introduction, however, we will demonstrate there are compelling reasons
to believe that during the Persian period, many Jewish people may not have been aware
or of anything resembling the Pentateuch or were not adhering to its laws.
Afterward, we will discuss the likelihood that Judaism might have emerged during the
subsequent early Hellenistic period.
We will conclude this chapter by cautiously considering the idea that the Torah became
widely known among the masses and was seen as authoritative law only in the late Hellenistic
period, particularly following the significant events associated with the Hasmonean revolt
in the middle of the 2nd century BCE.
The Persian period, 539-332 BCE.
Cyrus the Great, who ruled from around 559-530 BCE, was a member of the Tespid Achaemened's
royal families in Persia.
He achieved a significant conquest in 539 BCE when he took control of Babylon, gaining
control over the vast territories that comprised the Neo-Babylonian Empire at that time.
During the period of Persian rule, which lasted until the conquest of Alexander the Great
in the 330s BCE, there were several communities of Judeans who identified themselves as such
and lived in various parts of this Persian-controlled region.
Our goal is to explore the possibility to see if it is likely that the Torah and the
sacred text of Judaism have been accepted as the authoritative law by the Judean people
and put into practice during the Persian period.
To do this, we will begin by examining biblical accounts that are set in the time of the Tespid
Achaemened Kings.
These accounts tell the story of a Judean official named Ezra who was said to have publicly
disseminated the Torah of Moses among the people of Judea.
Next we'll delve into the theory of Persian imperial authorization, which suggests that
the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, became recognized as a authoritative
source of law for Judeans with the support and sponsorship of the Achaemened Persian
Empire.
We will analyze the primary evidence derived from archaeological findings and inscriptions
from three Judean communities within the Persian realm.
Judea itself referred to as Yehud, Elephantine, and Babylonia.
Our aim is to assess to what extent the religious practices and rituals of these communities
aligned with or diverged from the rules and regulations outlined in the Pentateuch.
This analysis will help us determine whether the Torah was indeed widely practiced and
regarded as authoritative law among these Judean communities during the Persian period.
Ezra Nehemiah's impact on the acceptance of the Torah of Moses in ancient Judea.
The canonical text of Ezra Nehemiah appears to be a composite work, comprising various
sources written by different authors over time.
Several of these sources describe the public dissemination of the Torah of Moses among the
people of Judea during the Achaemenid period and its subsequent adoption as binding law.
This provides an overview of these narratives and examines whether they reflect historical
events in which the Torah gained widespread acceptance as authoritative law among the
Judean population during the Persian period.
Introduction to Ezra Nehemiah's Torah Narratives
Ezra 7 introduces Ezra, a priest described as a skilled scribe well versed in the teachings
of Moses.
He arrives in Jerusalem during the seventh year of the Persian King Artaxerxes with a
mission to inquire into the teachings of the Lord, teach statutes and ordinances to the
people of Israel, and enforce God's law.
An Aramaic letter from King Artaxerxes authorizes Ezra to point magistrates and judges to uphold
these laws with strict penalties for those who disobey.
Upon his arrival, Ezra discovers that the people have intermarried with foreigners, which
is considered a transgression of God's commandments.
In response, Ezra calls for repentance, suggesting that the sinners should separate from their
foreign wives.
The account of how Ezra's educational mission unfolds is found in Nehemiah 8.
A large gathering of people assembles before the Watergate of Jerusalem and requests that
Ezra read the Book of the Instruction of Moses, which God had commanded Israel to follow.
Ezra reads from the book from dawn to noon, with assistance helping the people understanding
the teachings.
The people's response is emotional, with many weeping upon hearing the words of the Torah.
Subsequently, the heads of families, priests and Levites gather to learn from the Torah
and discover various commandments, including the observance of the Festival of Booths,
which they had not practiced for a long time.
Ezra continues to read from the book daily until the end of the seventh day holiday.
Following this, a group of Levites addresses a prayer to the Lord, recounting key events
from the Pentateuch, emphasizing the divine origin of the Torah, and making a covenant
to follow God's instruction, commandments, ordinances and statutes.
Nehemiah 13 reports the public reading of Moses' book, leading the separation of Ammonites
and Moabites from the congregation.
It also highlights violations of the Sabbath and foreign marriages among the people, which
Nehemiah addresses by enforcing Sabbath regulations and prohibiting these practices, evaluating
the historical accuracy of Ezra Nehemiah's Torah narratives.
The narratives in Ezra Nehemiah primarily focus on the efforts of Judean leaders, particularly
Ezra, to promulgate the Mosaic Torah as authoritative law among the common Judean populace.
However, it is crucial to examine whether these stories have a basis in historical
reality.
Israel is known about the authors of these texts, making it challenging to determine
when they were written.
Their primary interests appeared to be Judean, and their writings emphasized the importance
of observing the Mosaic Torah.
These texts are best categorized as ideological stories about the past, aiming to convey an
ideological agenda rather than historical accuracy.
Even if one were to consider these narratives as reflecting historical events, they do not
suggest a lasting impact of Ezra's efforts on the Judean masses.
The accounts in Nehemiah indicate that the people reverted to their previous transgressions
after an initial acceptance of the Torah.
In summary, the tales of Ezra Nehemiah's efforts to promote the Mosaic Torah do not provide
compelling evidence for the emergence of Judaism as early as the Persian period.
These stories should be viewed as idealized depictions with an ideological agenda rather
than an accurate account of historical events.
The theory of Persian imperial authorization.
Some scholars have proposed the theory of Persian imperial authorization, suggesting
that the Achaemenid authorities may have played a role in codifying the Pentateuch as the
official legal code for the province of Yehud.
However, this hypothesis has faced significant challenges.
First, it's unclear whether the evidence cited to support this theory points to a unified
Achaemenid policy of granting imperial authorization to local legal norms.
The documents used as evidence often have ambiguous meanings, and the cases they describe
present an incongruous picture of Persian authorities' dealings with local matters.
Second, even if one were to accept the idea of Achaemenid authorization, it is unlikely
that the Persian authorities would have ratified a document like the Pentateuch, which includes
extensive narrative material and regulations that may have conflicted with imperial interests.
The content and format of the Pentateuch does not align with what one would expect from
the officially authorized legal code.
The theory of Persian imperial authorization is few adherents today due to the lack of substantial
evidence and the challenges it faces in explaining the origins of the Pentateuch.
It is essential to critically evaluate historical hypotheses based on available evidence and
context.
Archaeological and Epigraphic Evidence Archaeological and epigraphic evidence from
the Persian period sheds light on the ritual and cultic practices of Judeans in different
geographical locations, including Judea, Elephantine in Egypt, and Babylonia.
This evidence helps us understand the extent to which the Judeans may have followed Torah
Laws.
In Judea, there is limited evidence that suggests some people were not strictly adhering to Pentateuchal
dietary laws as they were consuming catfish, a fish prohibited in the Torah.
Coins minted in the 4th century BCE, Yahud also displayed human and animal images which
may have been inconsistent with Pentateuchal regulations.
Additionally, terracotta figurines and an anthropomorphic vessel with a human face have
been found at various sites in Yahud, potentially indicating deviations from religious practices
outlined in the Pentateuch.
Regarding the cultic sphere, there is evidence of the veneration of the deity Yahweh among
Judeans in Persian area Yahud.
The use of theophoric elements derived from Yahweh in personal names suggests a continued
devotion to this deity.
References to a high priest in Jerusalem in an Elephantine papyri implies the existence
of a temple dedicated to the cult of Yahweh.
However, no archaeological remains of a Persian period temple in Jerusalem have been identified.
In terms of ritual artifacts, there is a lack of cultic figurines and sanctuaries in Persian
period Yahud compared to neighboring regions.
Some scholars have proposed that this absence reflects a religious revolution in which pagan
elements were purged from Judean religious practices.
However, recent research has challenged this hypothesis, highlighting the need for more
nuanced interpretation of the archaeological evidence.
Readers from Persian era Judea also raised questions about the exclusivity of Yahweh worship.
Some coins imitated Athenian prototypes, featuring the image of the Greek goddess Athena.
Other coins displayed potentially different deities alongside Yahweh, suggesting a possible
coexistence of various divine beings in the religious consciousness of Judeans during
this period.
The archaeological and epigraphic evidence provides insights into the religious practices
of Persian period Judeans, but it does not conclusively demonstrate widespread adherence
to Pentateuchal regulations.
The evidence suggests a complex religious landscape in which the veneration of Yahweh
coexisted with other practices and beliefs, leaving room for a diversity of religious
expressions among the Judean communities of the time.
Elephantine
In the upper Nile region of Egypt, specifically on the island of Elephantine and its neighboring
mainland settlement of Sayini, archaeologists have uncovered a significant collection of
papyri in Ostraca dating back to the Persian era.
This remarkable discovery sheds light on a Judean community that thrived during the
5th century BCE.
These ancient texts provide a glimpse into the religious and cultural practices of this
community, which identified itself as Judeans, and worshipped a deity referred to as Yah,
or Yah, shortened forms of Yahweh.
These documents contain precise dates ranging from the early 5th century BCE to the end
of that century.
Notably, the Judean leadership at Elephantine engaged in written correspondence with fellow
Judeans in Judea proper, including the provincial governor of Yahud and a high priest and subordinate
priesthood in Jerusalem.
Some previous scholarship has attempted to interpret these Elephantine texts in light
of the Pentateuchal laws, drawing parallels between the practices described in the documents
and biblical rules of purity, the observance of Passover, and the festival of unleavened
bread.
However, it is essential to approach these interpretations with caution, as they assume
from the outset that the Judeans of Elephantine were aware of and observed the laws of the
Torah leading to circular reasoning.
Remarkably, none of the Elephantine documents explicitly mention the term Torah or an Aramaic
equivalent, the name of Moses, or any document resembling the Pentateuch.
Furthermore, there is no citation of verses that resemble those found in the Pentateuch.
This suggests that the Torah, as known in later Jewish tradition, was not part of the
religious landscape of Elephantine.
Intriguingly, some documents within the Elephantine corpus seem to conflict with the assumption
that the Judeans at this location regarded the Pentateuch as anything authoritative as
a source of law or even new of its existence.
These Judeans simultaneously venerated multiple deities alongside Yahweh, directly contradicting
the Pentateuch's prohibition of polytheism.
For example, one document mentions a Judean woman named Miptaya, who swore an oath by
Sati, a goddess.
Another document speaks of a Judean making an oath to Herimbethel, referred to as the
God.
Yet another document mentions an oath invoking Herem, the God, in by the place of prostration.
And I'm not even going to try and pronounce some of these words here, but you see them.
Which could be interpreted as a reference to the goddess Annat as the consort of Yah.
Some letters and inscriptions suggest a broader religious context where Judeans invoked multiple
deities alongside Yahweh.
For instance, a letter to fellow Judeans begins with a salutation invoking the gods, indicating
a polytheistic framework.
Another letter wishes welfare through the favor of all the gods.
Additionally, a servant named Gebel blesses his Judean lord by Yah and by Canum, invoking
both the Judean deity and the Egyptian god Canum.
A particularly intriguing find is a papyrus scroll from Elephantine dated to around 419
or 400 BCE, listing individual members of the garrison of the Judeans who donated silver
to Yah, or Yahweh, along with sums allocated to other deities, while the distribution of
offerings to multiple gods remains a mystery.
It is evident that the Judean Jedaniah allocated contributions to Yahweh and two other Semitic
deities without apparent controversy.
The evidence of polytheistic practices among the Judeans at Elephantine extends to cases
where individuals with non-Hebrew names bearing theophoric elements of deities other than
Yahweh are linked to those with Hebrew Yahwistic names.
This implies that some Judeans chose names for their children that acknowledged deities
beyond Yahweh.
Furthermore, there is evidence of a temple dedicated to Yahweh on Elephantine Island
throughout much of the 5th century BCE, which contradicts Deuteronomic prescriptions against
offering sacrifices outside the chosen place in Cisjordan, Jerusalem.
This temple, referred to as the altar house, was operated by priests and staff conducting
various ritual offerings and sacrifices.
Several documents, including letters dated to 407 BCE, mentioned the destruction of this
temple by troops from Saini and priests of Canoom in 410 BCE.
The Elephantine Judeans sought assistance for its rebuilding, even contacting Judean
officials in Yehud and Samaria.
These documents do not indicate any awareness among the Elephantine Judeans that having
a temple outside Jerusalem might be problematic.
The evidence from Elephantine suggests that the Torah, as understood in later Jewish tradition,
was likely unknown to Judeans living there.
Their religious practices and cultic rituals appear to have diverged significantly from
the prescriptions of the Pentateuch.
Importantly, these practices do not seem to have differed substantially from those of
other Judeans within the Persian Empire.
This complex picture challenges previous assumptions about the homogeneity of the Judean religious
observance during this period and invites further scholarly exploration.
Babylonia, a significant collection of cuneiform tablets dating from 572 to 477 BCE, offers
insights into the presence of Judeans and Babylonia during this period.
These tablets provide a valuable historical record, shedding light on the lives and cultural
practices of the Judean community in ancient Babylonia.
Approximately one third of these tablets originated from a location known as Yahuda, or Yahudu,
Judah Town, or Alusa Yahudaya, town of the Judeans.
I butcher these, so please forgive me.
Others were written at sites named Alusa Nassar, or Bit Nassar, and Bit Ibriram.
The individuals mentioned in these documents often bear names that are distinctly Hebrew
or include Yahwistic theophoric elements.
A similar pattern can be observed in the Marasu Archive, another collection of text from a
slight later period within the Persian era, 455 to 403 BCE.
Surprisingly, these documents do not indicate any knowledge of the existence of the Pentateuch
among Babylonian Judeans during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.
There is no evidence to suggest that they observed the rules and regulations outlined
in the Pentateuch.
In fact, these texts reveal that Babylonian Judeans did not consciously avoid participating
in transactions on Saturdays, which is noteworthy given the significance of the Sabbath in Judaic
tradition.
One particularly intriguing aspect is the presence of theophoric names associated with deities
other than Yahweh among Judean families in both the Yahudu documents and the Marasu
Archive, albeit in small numbers.
Of note is the deity Bit El, seemingly identical to the Theonym Bethel, which played a prominent
role in Judean documents from Elephantine.
This suggests that Judeans in Babylonia may have incorporated the veneration of various
gods alongside their reverence for Yahweh.
The use of seals for signing documents also provides insights into the religious landscape
of Babylonian Judeans.
Some of these seals featured divine symbols or images of deities such as Marduk, Ishtar,
Sin and Ahura Mazda, suggesting a willingness to openly display reverence for other deities
alongside Yahweh.
Additionally, certain marriage agreements pertaining to Judeans invoked Babylonian deities
like Marduk, Zarpanitu and Nabu to enforce the terms of the agreement.
The cuneiform tablets associated with Babylonian Judeans provide a nuanced perspective on their
religious practices.
Unlike the strict monotheism often associated with later Judean tradition, these records
suggest that the Judeans of Babylonia did not consider the veneration of Yahweh incompatible
with the open display of reverence for other deities.
This complex religious landscape challenges the conventional assumption and highlights
the diversity of religious beliefs and practices among ancient Judean communities.
Available literary, epigraphic and archaeological evidence from the Persian period does not
strongly support the notion that a significant number of ordinary Judeans adhered to the
precepts and prohibitions outlined in the Pentateuch during this early timeframe.
Moreover, there is little indication that the existence of a compilation resembling
the Pentateuch or any other or any of its constituent parts was widely known beyond
a small circle of Judean literati.
The narratives in Ezra Nehemiah, which describe mass acceptance of the Torah among the Judean
populace are best understood as ideological stories rather than accurate historical accounts.
These narratives do not inherently suggest a reflection of historical reality.
Even if we were to accept these tales at face value, they imply that Ezra's promulgation
of the Torah had limited lasting impact on the Judean masters.
The theory of Persian imperial authorization would suggest that the Achaemenid rulers would
have sponsored the Pentateuch as the local law of Yehud lacks compelling evidence.
Additionally, archaeological and epigraphic findings from Judea, Elephantine, and Babylonia
indicate that Judean ritual and cultic practices during the Persian era often diverged significantly
from the fundamental rules and regulations found in the Pentateuch.
Notably, the acceptance or tolerance of the veneration of deities other than Yahweh was
a common practice amongst these Judean communities contrary to the Pentateuch's prescriptions
against polytheistic worship.
When we consider the popular ritual and cultic practices of the Judean masses during the
Persian period, they seem to closely resemble those of their Iron Age ancestors.
While some unique cultural practices may have been shared among Judeans under Persian rule,
these practices did not necessarily give rise to what we now recognize as Judaism, a distinct
way of life guided by a legal system rooted in the Pentateuch, complete with commandments,
prohibitions, and regulations.
Certainly, the evidence presented here does not definitively prove that the Torah did not
emerge as the authoritative law of the Judeans during the Persian period.
However, the evidence does suggest that familiarity with Torah observance was not widespread during
this time, while instances of non-compliance with Torah laws are well documented.
This leads us to consider that the origins of Judaism may be better sought in a later
era as the evidence does not strongly support its emergence during the Persian period.
The Early Hellenistic Period, 332-167 BCE
During the Early Hellenistic Period, which spanned from 332-167 BCE, significant changes
occurred in the region of the Persian Levant, including Judea.
This era was marked by the conquest of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, followed by the division
of his empire among the generals, known as the Diadochi after Alexander's death in 323 BCE.
Judea changed hands multiple times during this period, eventually falling under the
rule of Ptolemy I the Soter around 301 BCE, who governed from Alexandria.
It remained under Ptolemaic rule until approximately 200 BCE when Antiochus III Megas of the Seleucid
Empire or Dynasty, ruling from Antioch on the Aranties, seized control of the Southern Levant.
This dominion continued unchallenged until a revolt led by the Hasmonean family erupted,
likely around 167 BCE, during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.
In this section, we aim to assess whether the Torah might have been embraced as the
authoritative law by the common Judeans during the 165 year span between Alexander's conquest
and the Hasmonean revolt.
To do so, we will have to critically examine several literary sources that suggest the
Torah's familiarity among regular Judeans during this period.
Additionally, we will explore a hypothesis proposed by Michael Lefebvre, which suggests
that the Pentateuch evolved from a descriptive collection of laws to a prescriptive code
of law in response to contemporary Greek ideas about written law.
Literary Evidence Citations Attributed to Hecateus of Abdera
Two sources purportedly cite the lost writings of Hecateus of Abdera, a late 4th century
BCE figure.
The first citations come from Josephus's against Apian, but it is widely considered
pseudopigraphic and not attributed to Hecateus.
The second citation is found in the 9th century CE Bibliotheca of Phodius, who quoted from
the mid 1st century BCE author Diodorus Siculus.
In Diodorus' account, he describes the Judeans as followers of Moses, who established laws
and customs for them.
Diodorus claims to directly cite from the Judeans' law.
Phodius, however, accuses Diodorus of distorting the truth by falsely attributing his description
to Hecateus, suggesting that this citation might be questionable.
Modern scholars generally reject Phodius' skepticism regarding Diodorus' claim to
have drawn from Hecateus.
Most believe that Diodorus did use Hecateus' work and that the citation may be from Hecateus
of Abdera, circa 300 BCE, not Hecateus of Miletus, circa 500 BCE.
However, there are uncertainties regarding whether this citation truly represents direct
Hecatean content, as Diodorus regularly combined information from multiple sources in his histories.
Given these uncertainties, it's not compelling evidence to conclude that the Judean mass
is new in regard to the Torah as authoritative by the 3rd century BCE, the letter of Eurystheus
and the Septuagint.
The letter of Eurystheus presents an account of a delegation sent to Jerusalem by Ptolemy's
2nd Philadelphus in the 270s BCE to translate the Judean law into Greek.
This translation is described as divine legislation for all Judeans.
While this account suggests the existence of a Judean law in the 270s BCE, its authenticity
is debated among scholars, with many dating it to a later period.
Even if we accept the early date of the translation, it doesn't necessarily indicate that the
Pentateuch had already achieved widespread recognition and authority among the Judean
masses.
We lack historical context about the translation's reception among Greek-speaking Judeans.
Additionally, the translators of the Septuagint consistently used the Greek term NOMOS to translate
the Hebrew, Torah.
However, this choice doesn't conclusively establish that the Pentateuch was universally
regarded as authoritative, Pentateuchal narratives and fragments of Demetrius the Chronographer.
This is attributed to Demetrius the Chronographer, date to the reign of Ptolemy IV, Philip Hader,
circa 221-204 BCE.
While these fragments show familiarity with Pentateuchal narratives, they do not reference
Mosaic or Judean laws, thus they provide no clear evidence of the Torah's recognition
among the Judean masses.
The ancestral laws and the letter and proclamation of Antiochus III.
Josephus cites letters from Antiochus III Megas that mention ancestral laws granted to the
Judeans after taking control of Judea around 200 BCE.
Scholars debate the authenticity of these documents and whether they reflect the recognition
of Mosaic law by the Judean masses.
Given potential alterations over several centuries, caution is warranted in drawing conclusions
about the normative authority of the Torah in 200 BCE.
The Law and Commandments in Binsira.
The wisdom of Binsira, composed in the 2nd century BCE, refers to Torah or Nomos and Commandments.
But the precise meaning is debated, Binsira's treatment of the Pentateuch appears more as
an acknowledgement of its significance rather than a detailed engagement with its laws.
The available literary evidence from the early Hellenistic period does not provide compelling
support for the idea that the Torah was widely recognized as authoritative among the Judean
masses during this time.
The sources are subject to debate, lack clear historical context, and often represent the
perspective of intellectuals rather than ordinary Judeans.
Torah remains challenging to determine the extent of the Torah's influence and recognition
among the broader population in the Hellenistic era.
Written law among the Greeks as a model for the Torah.
The transformation of the Torah, the foundational taxidudeism from a collection of descriptive
laws to a prescriptive legal code is a complex historical process.
This transformation took place during the early Hellenistic period, a time when Greek
culture and influence spread throughout the ancient world.
While there is limited direct evidence regarding the Torah's acceptance among the Judean
masses during this period, the history of law development provides insights into how
this transformation may have occurred.
In this discussion, we explore the hypotheses put forward by Michael Lafev, suggesting that
the exposure of Judeans to Greek concepts of written law played a pivotal role in the
recharacterization or recharacterizing the Pentateuch as prescriptive Torah, law collections
prior to the emergence of written law.
In our modern understanding, law collections are typically seen as prescriptive in nature
providing specific rules and regulations for society to follow.
However, an ancient Mesopotamia law writing served as different purposes.
While there were extensive law collections such as Hammurabi's Code, they were not considered
legislative in the modern sense.
Instead, these law codes primarily served as royal proclamations, testaments, and literary
exercises, offering evidence of the king's divine mandate rather than prescribing legal
norms.
These were prescriptive challenges, the notions of legislation in the ancient Mesopotamian
context, as laws were not codified in the way we understand them today.
The early Greeks, like their Mesopotamian counterparts, had customs, traditions, and
oral norms, guiding behavior, and resolving disputes, but they lacked a distinct body
of rules known as the law.
It was around the middle of the 7th century BCE that written laws began to appear in various
Greek cities.
These laws inscribed on public monuments and prominently displayed represented a revolutionary
development.
Unlike earlier societies, the Greeks made their laws publicly available, differentiating
them from customary norms and traditions.
Written Greek legislation covered a wide range of legal areas including civil, criminal, and
sacred matters such as rituals and festivals.
These laws referred to as sacred laws were treated with the same level of formality and
public accessibility as other legal norms.
This shift from customary regulation to written legislation was a fundamental change in the
Greek legal landscape and marked the emergence of true legislative systems.
The emergence of Torah as the Judean law.
Before the Hellenistic era, the Mosaic Torah was viewed as a descriptive collection of
laws and a representation of Yahwistic ideals practiced by Moses rather than a prescriptive
legal code.
Michael Lefebvre proposed that the Torah's recharacterization into prescriptive law occurred
during the Hellenistic period driven by two mechanisms.
The first mechanism was the administrative changes introduced by Ptolemy II in Egypt
around 275 BCE.
These reforms organized the judiciary into the hierarchies of laws which included recognition
of Judean law for Judean litigates.
This may have prompted the recharacterization of the Pentateuch as prescriptive law making
it the Judean law.
Even without direct administrative influence, the broader cultural impetus of Greek notions
about prescriptive law could have driven this transformation.
The second mechanism was the cultural pressure of Hellenistic presuppositions where prescriptive
law was considered a hallmark of civilization.
Greeks saw themselves as civilized in contrast to barbarian peoples ruled by lawless despot.
As Judeans came under Greek cultural influence, they may have sought to align their own culture
with the Greek model by recharacterizing the Pentateuch as prescriptive law.
While direct evidence of the Torah's acceptance among the Judean masses during the early
Hellenistic period is scarce, the influence of Greek concepts of written law offers a
plausible explanation for its transformation into prescriptive law.
Whether through administrative reforms or cultural pressures, the Hellenistic era provided
a suitable backdrop for the emergence of the Torah as an authoritatively binding prescriptive
law akin to the Greek model of written legislation.
This transformation marked a crucial development in the history of legal systems and their
impact on society.
The late Hellenistic Hasmonean period 167-63 BCE.
During the mid-2nd century BCE, a series of complex events unfolded, leading the Judeans
to gain independence from the Seleucid Empire and establish their autonomous polity under
the rule of a Hasmonean family.
The books of 1st and 2nd Maccabees attribute these events to the policies of Antiochus
IV Epiphanes which disrupted the cult in the Jerusalem Temple and forbade the Judeans
from following their native laws.
An uprising began around 167 BCE led by a priest named Matathias.
From the Hasmonean clan and his sons including Judas Maccabees, Jonathan Uphus and Simon
Thassi, Simon the last of the Thies brothers, established an independent state in 142 BCE,
marking the Hasmonean dynasty's rise to power which continued until Pompey's conquest in
63 BCE.
In the following discussion we will explore the likelihood that the Torah was adopted by
the Judean masses as their authoritative law during the Hasmonean period when they broke
free from Seleucid rule.
We will examine literary evidence from the books of Daniel 1 and 2 Maccabees to understand
whether the Torah existed as an established law before Antiochian persecutions or if these
accounts were later created as political propaganda to legitimize Hasmonean rule.
Additionally, we will consider whether the proactive Hasmonean policies played a role
in disseminating the Torah and making it the authoritative law among the Judean populace.
The literary evidence.
The Antiochian persecutions in Daniel.
In the second half of the book of Daniel, which is set in the Babylonian and Persian
periods but likely alludes to the reign of Antiochus IV, there are cryptic visions and
prophecies that describe a king's actions against the Holy Covenant and the Temple Colt.
While these texts are often interpreted as referring to Antiochus' decrees against the
Torah, they primarily focus on the disruption of the Temple Colt rather than Torah observation
The references to a Holy Covenant and changing times and laws may allude to the Torah but
could also refer to the traditional Temple rites, the law in the persecution narratives
in 1st and 2nd Maccabees.
In contrast to Daniel, 1 and 2 Maccabees emphasize the law and its observance in the
context of Antiochian persecutions.
These texts describe how Antiochus prohibited various Torah-related practices such as circumcision,
Sabbath observance, and dietary laws.
Many Judeans resisted these decrees and were willing to die for their faith.
However, it is unclear whether the Torah itself was widely regarded as authoritative among
the Judean masses before these events.
Hasmonean sponsorship for the Pentateuchal Laws.
There is a hypothesis suggesting that the Hasmonean leaders, particularly the sons of
Metathias, played a pivotal role in promoting the Torah as the official laws of the Judeans.
They may have adopted the Pentateuch to unify the newly formed Judean state and solidify
their role.
This adoption of the Pentateuch as the legal foundation could have been portrayed as a restoration
of an ancient, original law downplaying its novelty.
By doing so, they created a powerful ideological glue to counter the influence of the Greek
culture and Hellenization, later Hasmonean territorial and cultural expansion.
The Hasmonean leaders such as John Hurcanus and Aristobulus I extended their dominion over
neighboring regions and imposed Judean laws, including circumcision and Sabbath observance
on non-Judean populations.
This suggests a deliberate effort to spread the Torah and integrate these regions into
the Judean way of life, which might have been an extension of earlier Hasmonean policies
aimed at promulgating the Torah among the Judeans themselves, the rise of sectarianism.
The emergence of sectarian groups like the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, and the Kumran
community, known for their legal disputes over Torah interpretation, coincided with the
mid-second century BCE.
This suggests that the widespread adoption of Pentateuch as authoritative law might have
triggered disagreements over its proper interpretation, leading to the rise of these sects.
This development aligns with the hypotheses.
The Torah became widely accepted and authoritative during the Hasmonean period.
While historical evidence is limited, there are indications that the Torah's adoption
as authoritative law among the Judeans might have occurred during the Hasmonean period,
especially under the leadership of the early Hasmoneans.
The spread of the Torah, the portrayal of Antiochian persecutions, and the rise of sectarianism
all point to significant developments in Judean religious and legal practices during this era.
Conclusions.
The question of when Judaism first emerged, particularly whether it originated in the
second century BCE under the influence of the Hasmonean priestly family, has been a
subject of investigation.
The hypothesis suggests that the widespread adoption of the Torah among the Judean populace
may have been facilitated by the proactive support of early Hasmonean leaders.
These leaders may have legitimized their sponsorship of the Torah as the authoritative law of their
newly autonomous polity by portraying themselves as the restorers of an ancient divine legal
system.
While the idea that early Hasmonean leaders played a role in promoting the Torah remains
speculative, it is known that their descendants actively promoted the Torah among the Semitic
peoples they conquered.
The emergence of sectarian groups with differing interpretations of the Torah during this period
suggests that the widespread promotion of the Torah was relatively recent development.
Throughout this documentary, we have consistently found that there is no evidence of a widely
practiced Judean way of life governed by the Torah before the second century BCE.
In the previous section, we had gone beyond the existing data to assess the likelihood
of Judaism emerging during a specific historical period.
Our analysis leads us to conclude that during the Persian period, the Judean way of life
was likely guided by cultural traditions from the Iron Age rather than a formal Torah law.
A central aspect of being a Judean at this time was the worship of Yahweh and participation
in the Deities' cultic rituals, although the extent to which this excluded the worship
of other gods remains uncertain.
Some practices found in the Pentateuch such as the prohibition against eating the hip
sinew and circumcision may have been part of the Judean culture since the Persian period
or even earlier.
The evidence from Elephantine indicating a Judean form of Passover ritual and 7-day festival
may also reflect ancient practices with unclear origins.
However, there is little reason to believe these practices were legally mandated by something
resembling mosaic law.
Therefore, the reconstructed Judean way of life in the Persian period without a Torah
as a regulating principle does not resemble what we commonly understand as Judaism.
The two centuries following Alexander the Great's conquest in 332 BCE until the establishment
of the Hasmonean polity in the middle of the second century BCE appeared to be a more
favorable period to explore the origins of Judaism.
Various hypotheses suggest that Judaism may have emerged during the early Hellenistic
period when Judea was under Hellenistic rule or during the late Hellenistic period after
Judeans gained autonomy under the Hasmonean family's leadership.
In both scenarios, Judaism emerged in a world deeply influenced by Hellenistic culture,
making it plausible to consider Judaism as a product of the Hellenistic Crucible, the
very term Judaism itself, a blend of Hebrew and Greek, underscores this cultural synthesis.
This marks the conclusion of our exploration with the wonderful work of Dr. Yonatan Adler.
His book is a must-grab because it goes much, much deeper into the sources that we could
cover in this video.
Looking back, we recognize that this is not the final chapter in the story of Judaism,
but rather its prelude and introduction.
Judaism has evolved in various directions throughout its history, giving rise to rabbinic
Judaism and other influential branches.
Moreover, the roots of Christianity and Islam can be traced back to the Judaism whose origins
we have examined.
In this perspective, the emergence of Judaism has played a pivotal role in shaping world
history over the past two millennia, with its influence likely to continue for centuries
or even millennia to come.
Considering Dr. Adler's archaeological evidence, I'd like to ask a question.
If Judaism as a practice way of life for the common Judeans didn't actually start
till the second century BCE, then how far back can we safely say that the material we
call the Bible and all of the extra canonical materials around this period goes?
Is it really likely that the five books of Moses really go back to the early Persian
period or even before that?
Could it be that much of the materials scholars think is dated way, way back, like prophets
or other books, are actually a late creation sometime after Hellenism set up shop in the
world?
Just as Dr. Adler starts with times we know the evidence exists, then works backwards
into periods where it appears to be absent.
Can we attempt to do this with the biblical texts?
If we do this, how far back do these texts really go?
Most scholars use internal textual evidence to attempt dating these materials.
But what if that is circular and not driven by solid external data?
I'm curious to hear your thoughts about this issue.
Let us know in the comments section.
Also let us know if you enjoyed this documentary.
I hope you purchased Dr. Adler's book on the origin of Judaism.
