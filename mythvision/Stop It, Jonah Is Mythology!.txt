just stop the nonsense. Jonah is mythology swallowed by a giant fish for three days and three nights
then spit up and goes into the heart of the Assyrian Empire, Nineveh preaching repentance
and then all of a sudden they repent it and that this somehow is historically evident in the fact
that the power of the world at the time the Assyrians their power waned they were a cruel nation
and that somehow well how did they stop ruling they repented now I don't know if this is some
joke because technically it looks bad repenting causes you to lose the power but Dr. Joshua Bowen
answers this question diving deep from a questionnaire of our patreon here at MythVision
and shows you know what they're really doing is
Dr. Joshua Bowen we've got a question from W.M. Law on my patreon Derek I'm only on page
124 of his book being ex-Mormon ex-reformed Christian who's read the entire Old Testament
chapter one was a recap of the biblical story that I'm familiar with my question relates to the Assyrian
kingdom as a Christian we would be told that the Assyrian kingdom was a brutal kingdom that
terrorized its neighbors and gave no quarter but that there was a period of time when it won't
when it waned the Christians would say that that that is evidence of Jonah having preached
to the Ninevites and them repenting is there any evidence of such a period in the archaeological
record a period of them repenting well it's it seems like they waned from being such cruel
overlords if that makes sense and and so Christians will say see Jonah did preach repentance from
their wicked cruelty you see so let me know um so you know taking the book of jota like that trying
to look for historical um you know seeing this some sort of a historically reliable
account of Jonah's life probably not a good way to go about engaging at the text one of the things
that's clear about um ancient Near Eastern history and you can see the the Assyrians
uh quite clearly is there is there is this um pattern of expansion when a nation is strong
and contraction when a nation is weak and normally it hinges upon the ruler himself so if you have a
strong sort of aggressive uh clever ruler you'll see expansion you'll see annual campaigning
particularly out to the west from Assyria and this this you know growth of Assyria proper
and and you know taking over creating vassals and getting tribute and those sorts of things
so one of the kings that sort of epitomizes this big expansion after a period of contraction is to
glath please of the third and he comes to throne in 745 so you know 8th century this is something
that would be important to um in the history of the nation of Israel and we see this reflected
in the biblical texts so the Neo-Syrian empire has its periods of you know real strength if I
talk about in the book how toward the end the new Assyrian empire starts to wane um
and there are probably a lot of different reasons why it happened uh not because this is
Jonah went and preached to them and they decided to give up their I don't know um militaristic ways
you know first of all that the picture that's you know painted of the Assyrians or the Canaanites
or the Malachites or any of these people of course is that they're grossly immoral and wicked
they do everything horribly and they're just terrible and um of course hopefully we all
recognize this a bit of propaganda going on here and of course the Neo-Syrian empire did this as
well right so if you read through Mario Liberani's book for example on Assyria which is actually
right here um you know you'll see him talking about how the Assyrians portrayed themselves
and justified their holy war right and when they did that what they did is much as the
Israelites did and much as every ancient people would have done in this position you you create an
other right that you you have to bring into subjection bring into control and the way that
you justify doing that is you you know you don't say uh I just want to go conquer those people
right because sorry that's my three-year-old up there um you know because that doesn't look good
right doesn't reflect well because there's still this idea that you have to have justification
for doing what it is that you're doing and the gods don't the gods don't look kindly in in the
ancient Near East upon people doing oppressive things much to everyone's surprise you know
maybe that's in fundamentalist evangelical circles you know the idea that the ancient Mesopotamian
gods would have been against oppression they were right you don't oppress the poor you don't oppress
the weak so they the king still needed justification for doing these types of campaigns and so one of
the ways that they do it is the same way that you see in the Eber bible and that is they like
filipine the other side go figure right it's how we all do this you know you you you think about
the way that the germans are portrayed when you watch um you know like uh like captain america
or something you know the germans are always the super bad right um and that's that's not to say
that the nazis weren't bad of course they were bad right but like it can spread to all germans for
example anyway the point is that uh that might might not have been a good example um i want to
be clear that the nazis were horrible right just be clear right um but that vilification that type
of vilification is something that you see in the ancient world all the time and so because of that
the assyrians would say those people out to the west the god asher our god asher extended his
benevolent arm to them to bring them in and to care for them right and of course they and of
they rebelled they rebelled against his arm and so uh i i have to go out and conquer them
same thing seems to like take place kind of in the canaan um or even another example biblically
uh would be when the vilification of all the kings of the north come from the southern riders
i mean are they really that bad and that horrible of a king in the north or is this a
anachronistic explanation saying well the reason why this happened all these bad kings happened to
be there or why did what in this i'm leading into the assyrian thing is like why did they stop being
so well maybe they lost power like when egypt the reason why the exodus you know if we have
this story as ronald hennell saw us well what happened was they kind of went bankrupt and they
collapse and now boom yeah i mean this is what happened at the end it's you know right around
1200 right so if people are interested in that sort of thing eric klein has a phenomenal book
it's right there called 1177 and we'll have him on the show here i think pretty soon but it talks
about this you know regional collapse international collapse um but you know like a good example
maybe maybe the german one wasn't all that all that good it was but you see this in the vilification
of um uh people from arabic countries after 9 11 yeah right everybody from the middle east
was then vilified right and you saw it horribly here in the united states right now certainly
these terrorists were terrible terrible people they did terrible terrible things um and i was on
active duty when that happened the air force um but that doesn't mean that all arabic people are
bad right and so they get vilified they become the other become the other and that justifies
you know the this sort of um well do we get the same thing with racial tensions too yes blacks
are all bad and in some people's lives or you look at these uh you know these cross burning
klu Klux Klan members and now all we all whites are the same you know you can get the same thing
happen in almost any situation and so so then if if you're but the i think for me the material
point is if you're trying to justify just like somebody in the klu klux klan wants to justify
their hatred just like um you know people that were incredibly anti-semitic against uh the jews
during world war two um anybody that wants to look at all arabs and justify that bigotry uh as as
being again as being justified is okay to do they're going to construct this narrative of the other
and they're going to say that the other side um is doing things oftentimes that they would never
do right what do they call that um um uh virtue signaling i think is what they call that but
that so so what we see then in uh the biblical text is this sort of othering and we see it um
with the new assyrians as well a really good example of this i i i feel like i want to clarify
this because uh this came up recently in my book uh on the chapter on the on archaeology talking about
the canaanites there is this sort of vilification that you see uh of the canaanites when it comes to
child sacrifice you see it all over the place in the heber bible oh they're they're sacrificing
their children to mullak right they're doing all these horrible horrible things and so i asked the
question uh that heath durrell asked and and that is like what let's let's get to the bottom of what
evidence do we have for uh child sacrifice among the canaanites and as it turns out there isn't
much right so then the question that we have to ask is all right sure um you know do we expect
to have a lot of evidence for child sacrifice like physical evidence in the archaeological record
probably not um but what evidence do we have that people are using to justify their position
to justify the position that the biblical text is is historically reliable and the evidence
that they're using is late evidence it's from carthage it's not from canaan and so what evidence
do we actually have from you know canaan proper nothing really solid right and so then if that's
one data point that's all right we don't have this positive evidence so then what other evidence
do we have well we we seem to have evidence in the narrative of the heber bible that the israelites
we're also practicing child sacrifice so with those two things combined we don't have any positive
evidence uh from the period to say that yes in the second millennium we've got child sacrifice
and that's why the israelites had to come in and do this conquest and we have seemingly positive
evidence that the israelites are doing this in the first millennium which is the time that we
probably think this exodus story came to its you know its its form um those two things combined
what's more reasonable to conclude it's this othering it's this othering that we see and so
again uh the the the new syrian empire is othering and doing these campaigns but when they don't have
the strength to do it anymore sort of bringing this back when they don't have the strength to
do it anymore they're they're having to deal with problems financial problems they're having to deal
with rebellions they're having to deal with local issues and all of those things make a a an administration
and the king you know kingdom focus in on itself in the same way that if you're having problems
at home it's difficult to go you know be successful doing something outside of the house because you
have to deal with your own problems internally and when you have internal problems the empire
tends to shrink back in on itself and so it's a really convenient thing to say ah well in 586
i mean not in 586 sorry and um in uh seven i was thinking a bit of the fault Jerusalem um but in
uh you know 712 710 when the new assyrian empire falls to the new Babylonian empire new Babylonian
empire uh you know this is sort of the culmination of all these things contracting the new assyrian
empire in and um i think it'll be foolish to say well it's you know leading up to that that the
contraction that we see that must be because you know we see repentance from Nineveh uh
because solely because we have that in the biblical text i don't think that's good historiography thank you
