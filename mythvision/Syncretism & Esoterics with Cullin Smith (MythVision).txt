view of Scripture. His name is Craig Nolan and he's bringing some very interesting insights
into the three serpents of Eden. Multiple-dimensional reality and we'll be giving us a bit of his
explanation of the Israel-only view. MythVision wants to hear how you are growing and learning
from our guests. How you are benefiting from the subject matter. We also want to hear about how we
can improve. Otherwise, we would be setting ourselves up like Superman without his kryptonite.
It wouldn't be very interesting without room to grow, but I will let Superman tell you more
about that. Hello, Superman. How is the fighting going and how much do people love your kryptonite?
I fought for those who cannot fight for themselves, not just for the minds of Americans,
but for those of the whole world. But without kryptonite, I wouldn't truly be human.
My weakness reminds me of my humanity so that I can remember my purpose. I'm not anyone's judge
and jury, but I continue to watch your show to help me remind myself of the mental battles that
take place, as well as the physical ones. Okay, thanks Superman. I would also like to thank Linda
Denney from our Facebook community for giving us a recommendation for our guests today.
We have someone who is bringing truth to your eyes through the internet. He has created a wide
range of YouTube films, presentations, written articles, tons of visual graphics and animations.
He has been making a wide range of videos on metaphysics, occult sciences, symbolism, etymology,
health, syncretism, and more. He is currently working on publication that will be called
Symbols of Power, which I certainly look forward to. He is single, 30 years old, living in San
Antonio, Texas. Please welcome our guest, Colin Smith. Thanks for being with us, Colin.
Can you tell us a bit about yourself, how you started making your YouTube channel, how you
got into the esoteric sciences, stuff like that? Sure, thanks so much for having me on.
It's good to connect with you also recently. I first read one of your notes that you published
about, I think it was with excerpts from Gerald Massey about the very poignant symbolism about
the serpent, a lot of which, in fact, almost most of which I ended up covering. I haven't actually
read Gerald Massey's books before, so going through and reading that for the first time,
it was pretty amazing. Seeing how I didn't do any real background research, I just
threw things in as they were going along when I was tracing the symbolism for the Symbols of
Power Part 3 film. There was just a huge correspondence there, so I was pretty happy to
see those correspondences taking place, so that was real cool. About me, I usually don't like to
talk too much about myself. That's one of the things that I really don't like is everything I
do and present. It's not about me whatsoever, it's about the information, it's about the core
material that I feel is crucial for people to understand and they need to really grasp a firm
understanding of that information. Number one, to be able to implement positive change in their
lifestyle, a lot of which I have personally implemented myself through my own journey of
learning and of transforming and bettering myself. Again, that's the core message,
is the information itself. It's not about the messenger. A lot of critics will try to
make ad hominem attacks against your argument based on the person itself. That is definitely
what I try to avoid at all times. That's basically my main tenet of everything that I do and everything
that I recommend is to avoid the messenger altogether and just take what you can from
the core message, follow that up and follow through on your own. I got started with all of this back
in 2012, was when I first began my esoteric journey of self-discovery, of self-knowledge.
During that so-called awakening process that I experienced, my awakening came from
the information regarding the Mayan calendar in around 2012. A lot of the mainstream information
that I had been at that point of time, I was basically working full-time, nine to five job,
and I was in my free time. I would basically, the only things I would ever watch on TV would be
either science channel, history channel, and before that I previously, I only ever watched
educational stuff, science channel, history channel, things involving animals, nature, biology,
and pure humor comedy and those were my main core interests at the time. Although I've always had
a huge interest in all aspects of natural science ever since I can, before I can even remember.
My first major love was dinosaur species and I had huge books on it and I'm talking when I was
four years old, I knew pretty much every species of dinosaur and I mean I could even name off a
lot of the genus and I mean a lot of the Latin names of the dinosaur so that was my first real
just love of nature and biology and somewhat a little bit of history in there as well.
So from there, I wanted to be a paleontologist, that was when I was four years old and then I
progressed from there, then I wanted to be a herpetologist which is the study of snakes
and but I've always had a core love for reptiles in general so my main passion, my main love
is all things nature. Natural sciences, I love geology, I love biology mostly is my main core
passion. It's what I love studying the most because you know the more we study nature,
the more we learn about nature and it's amazing how we are just starting to come into our own
real fundamental understanding of how nature works and it's funny that as we continue to that
search without you know that search outside of ourselves, we start to learn how it really
reflects inside of ourselves which is really the core basic tenets of the hermetic principle
of correspondence, what's called the law of correspondence which is as within so without
and that which is above is so below which is a main you know that's the main tenet of basically
the fabric and structure of our reality itself and so that's what we cover a lot of in lifting
on lifting the veil and so that's one of the main things, one of my main passions. So during that
journey of discovery, I just learned so many things that basically I found all the answers to
the questions that I had been wondering ever since I can remember you know we start off as children
when we're roughly around three to four years old that's when we go through this I call it the Y
phase we just we want to understand our our place in relation to to our environment to the world
at large and we the way we go about that journey of seeking because we we go through this process
of amnesia during the birthing process or during the process of coming into this world
from the spiritual realm from the realm of pure consciousness we come into this world of
of physicality and we come through that through the veil of forgetting which is you know through
the amniotic sac the amniotic waters the the amnion which I will go deep into that in this book
that I'm currently writing it's it's I've got a whole presentation revolving around the etymology
as well as the symbolism and a lot of the mythology and and even some theology mixed in there that
goes along with this huge core tenant of the basically the veil of forgetting of forgetfulness
the the amniotic waters that we come into this world through and so through that veil of forgetting
you know we seek to understand our place in this world and in reality and it's along that that
process we go through the the questioning phase of why why why why why we want to know why things
occur why things happen not just how things happen but the most important is is the why
about it all and so and I specifically remember that phase in my life from four to five years old
constantly asking why and nobody around me could ever ever had the answers as to why they you know
my parents didn't know awesome parents but they just didn't know you know this esoteric knowledge
that I now know and have now I now realize that I had been seeking it my whole life
I just didn't know it I didn't know how to go about it I didn't know why I was seeking it but I
was it was there it had always been there always underlying my my foundation of what I knew about
the world and so you know so once I've I finally found all those answers through my process of
seeking about what the mystery of this 2012 um my calendar was which I you know had there was
lots of shows on the history channel about it at the time and of course it was all basically
disinformation propaganda basically end of the world theories end times theories great destruction
cataclysm the end of the world theories my beer you know then you get so you get from that you
you know so I took that search to you know to the internet to you know to further um see what
this was all about and of course that you get nothing but like end of the world theories you
know niberus coming back to destroy the world and aliens and an anarchy end times christian theories
and all of these just complete garbage theories that are out there but somehow um I found my way
through all of that stuff and just straight to a core tenant and that's how I found about their
hermetic sciences that you know basically all cultures around the world share a core foundational
mythology theology philosophy what have you they it's all a universal science that all connects
everything all together and it's basically a mother science you know a root that all other
sciences stem stem from and that is basically the study of astro theology and that is where I really
found you know that's where I really came into my own and there was a lot of teachers along
yeah was that did you find out about that through santos bonacci like I did santos is the first
source that I ever heard of astro theology from and there have been a lot of great teachers along
the way that I've learned a lot from um santos was one of those and I I have to you know disclose
a caveat there is that you know santos and I were good friends there for a while as well as colleagues
but we've had a falling off since the whole flat earth disinformation sigh up came on to the scene
and so so that's why I no longer you know like to associate myself with santos although he did
teach me a whole lot I learned a whole lot from him and I'm forever thankful for that but you
know we have to part our ways intellectually as well as professionally for those for that
for understanding of of you know basically the complete rejection of all truth and all
knowledge of all ancient knowledge and modern knowledge about the world that we live in which
is the sphericity the the spherical nature of our planet earth which can be proven from infinite
angles infinite ways infinite proofs that that so we're not going to go into that because I'm sure
you don't want that to be the core of the show no not really but yeah I had to mention that um
another one is uh michael tizarian has a great series about astro theology um uh also um
Jordan Maxwell has done some very great comprehensive presentations as well as whole
bodies of work around astro theology as well and that gets back into you know the the uh the more
ancient sources of astro theology which you know the the the great writers like jerald massie and
a lot of the other great hermeticists you know of course man manly p hall and many many others who
have come before that um so basically the core tenets of truth all revolve around that which is
in and of itself the core of astro theology is nature itself is the function of the cosmos itself
so that is where I found myself in relation to the whole and that is where we all find ourselves
in relation to the whole um and that is ultimately um what really matters in this world and in our
lives and in our spiritual seeking and in our um greater understanding of who we are and why we're
here so that is you know that's basically a summary of you know a very large and very long
comprehensive story that I could tell about myself but that's basically it
yeah so what made you consider the astrophysiology topic because I know that there's this astro
theology not a lot of people are talking about the physiology of the as above so below uh in egypt
right yeah um well that's a lot of that stuff that you will find in my symbols of power series
about um regarding what I like to call is a friend of mine Caleb Thomas is had first you know said
um the term astrophysiology and it you know it made a lot of sense to me regarding um my symbols
of power film series I previously before that I hadn't been calling it anything specific but
it is a very unique discovery that um I don't say I want to claim it but I've never heard of any
I've never seen never read never heard of any information prior to this it basically just came
through and I wasn't planning on it um being mapped out in the film series the way it was it
just sort of happened and that's the the amazing thing about these when I when I'm making these
videos and these films and even just writing you know the before that I hadn't been writing you know
full presentations but since those two those three major films I've been trying to write out all of
my presentations in basically an article or a book style format before I make the film presentation
that way I have a written transcript to go along with it and that way I can transfer the everything
in the video in the videos and then the film into an actual hardcover book that you know
you can take off offline which is the ultimate goal if you know a lot of my work is mainly online
and I want to take that offline so that way it will number one be preserved you know for a lot
longer than digital technology might be able to serve us for but so I first came across that
basically so for people who may not be aware astro theology is a compound word of astro
and theology theos Greek root word relating to god the study of god this the uh basically the
understandings of what we know about god as an actual of course meaning stars or or astronomy
as we know it so it's the combination it's basically it's essentially at the core etymological root
meaning it means the study of the stars and the heavens or the celestial bodies as deities
which all ancient cultures all mythologies all religions all theologies it all is core at
its core foundation these are allegories to explain the functions the purpose and our relation to
our place and purpose amongst the stars amongst the heavens amongst the celestial sphere of the
cosmos as we know it as well as the microcosmos which is the smaller the smaller reflection
of the larger whole and we can best understand this core hermetic principle of correspondence
of as above so below and basically from the scales of cellular biology or microbiology
studying you know how cells function not just in a petri dish but in in in vivo in the human body
itself so as we study the the micro portions of ourselves in our cellular biology our dna our
genetics and all of that comprehensive science that goes along with it the greater we can correlate
those understandings and see how it directly relates to the larger whole to the macro cosmos or to
the solar system the universe at large and in a fractal scale which you know for a fractal is
basically it's a hologram and hologram most people hear the word hologram or holographic
universe theory they associate it with you know artificial intelligence technology and basically
you know every all things artificial and programming and all of that although that's not
what the actual word of of hologram or holography means hologram comes from greek holos which means
whole and is the root word also of holy as well as which is etymologically linked to health
because to be healthy is to be whole and to be whole is to be healthy and you are not fragmented
you are not separated um which i mean i'm not going to go down a huge etymological train
there number one because i'll i'll get confused because it's such a huge web interconnected web
of words and terms and you know that's why i have to write it all out try to write it all out in
linear format so that we can you know really get to the core and follow that that thread well yes
it's jesus jesus went around and he would heal people and like he's you would say what is it
easier to say that your sins are forgiven or that uh get up and take up your mat and walk
right so that this of course is related to the zodiac but he's talking about being healed is
is what is being saved so this person was saved today they were healed today because they were
they're made holy so they're made whole yeah so i can see the connection there yeah yeah exactly
but um as with most of um what we will discover on lifting the veil is that you know there are
multiple layers there's you know pretty much there can be infinite layers to you know just a
single meaning of of certain things and multiple interpretations and you know well many one of
the problems i have with a lot of things is that many people just do subjective interpretations of
things right or you know based upon just hearsay and i like to i like to take things so much deeper
than that by actually substantiating um everything that i most i like to you know try to substantiate
everything that i say although you know nobody can substantiate everything that they say but
that's my goal that's what i aim for that's what i like to do um so there are multiple layers to
that but to get back to the core question of you know the the process of what i i call astrophysiology
which is basically how the planets how the universe at large the the macro cosmos how it directly
relates to particularly what's um these things have just been just kept coming out from i don't
even know where from the the universal mind itself the collective unconscious what whatever you want
to call it um the universal intelligence um it's basically a download that always comes through
every time i start making or in the process of producing these videos and i i usually intend
for these videos to be pretty short and to the point and concise i would like to keep them
about 15 minutes long or shorter if possible 10 to 15 minutes long 30 minutes at the most
but unfortunately for me that never happens because like as i start putting it all together
it just it goes fractal and by going fractal i mean that that it keeps expanding as the deeper
and deeper you go into that vortex the more it expands and the more you keep finding and so
it that's that's basically that's the nature of reality itself right there and that's what makes
it so hard you know so number one so time consuming so exhausting um to try and document all of that
is just but that's also the joy that's the pleasure that's the fun that's the journey of
the discovery the journey of the seeking um as you know seeking you shall find and you know it's
although that also basically is basically describing you know cognitive bias there which is
it's like seeking you will find it's like yeah you look for anything you want to hear or want to
find and you'll find it see i mean especially nowadays with all the fake news and you know
disinformation is you can literally look up anything you want and find confirmation of it so
that's just a funny paradox there you know and yet again multiple layers of meaning
to all of this but as i want to get to the actual core of the work itself um basically what i had
found in the process of that is that um through studying the actual the hard medical anatomy
the real anatomy not just like reading old esoteric books and you know repeating what
manly hall or what george w carry said or what some you know old um philosopher what some even
ancient historians you know um as many people like to appeal to ancients though you know the
ancients were so much more advanced than us and so that's it's basically it's a it's a it's a logical
phallus who could just appeal to ancients as being more advanced than us in many ways they were
but in many ways they also were not and you know as far as like you know hypocrites you know the
father of medicine um you know had some pretty white he was very right correct about many things
such as you know health and nutrition being the core foundation you know food being the core
foundation of health and well-being but also had some wild theories like what he called the wandering
uterus which you know i forget exactly i forget exactly off the top of my head exactly what he
thought the wandering uterus was but i think he he thought that but it's it's it's number one it's
hilarious and that could that could i mean we could get into you know sir george frazier's
um golden bow who documented like thousands upon thousands of examples of ancient homeopathy
and simply what he called sympathetic magic and how you know so many of the ancient homeopathic
beliefs are just hilarious i mean they're so ridiculous that it's it's literally i mean i've
pretty much i i don't know if i've ever laughed out loud that hard while listening to
you know i was listening to the audiobook version of it and it was just i mean i couldn't
stop laughing um you know and so we just to i'm going off on tangents here i can't help
myself yeah no um i'd like to talk a little bit more about uh the serpent etymology because this
was part of the this reference i had from this lady but also we're going to be having somebody on
who's going to talk a bit more about like the garden of eden and these hebrew words which
actually are talking about the serpent and so what have you found uh that sort of would be offensive
to like a literal reading of the ancient texts in terms of like the serpent etymology and what it
actually represents uh or what it's connected to well that's a huge i mean that is a huge probably
one of the largest you know one of the largest specific studies that anyone can go into um is
the science of the science and symbolism of the serpent that's actually was the original title of
my um of my symbols of power part three presentation it was supposed to be originally called science
of serpent symbolism just as that's sort of what it ended up getting into and um symbols of power
part two also went deeply into a lot of that and i didn't i never really intended for it too it just
sort of happened along the way um as everything everything does i i don't even i'm usually never
really intend for anything in fact i never intended to be doing anything that i'm covering right now
it just sort of it all happened and you know that's what i love about it is that you know these
things just happened but so the specific etymologies of the serpent i mean it can it's so vast and so
broad that i mean it's it's the core archetypal mytheme from all cultures of the world um all
cultures all religions all theologies um basically they they revere the serpent and from everything
from you know norse mythology mayan cosmology ancient egyptian cosmology hindu cosmology
mythology um native american um aboriginal or australian aboriginals uh you know tribes and
cultures the world over um the cosmic serpent um you can you can scale it from you can it applies
to all scales macro cosmically in um symbolism of the universe so i mean when we talk about um if
we want to get into the etymologies or anything like that um it can be very specific but it's
it's very broad because i mean it would have to be a more specific um question or something
right i mean like like like for instance like what is what's happening in for the bible because
like some of our community uh they're studying like eschatology and they're looking at these
time statements in the scripture god's gonna make the end known from the beginning uh what's
happening in the garden of eden uh with the serpent on the tree and he's tempting adam and
eve what would this represent in say astral theology or astrophysiology uh in your mind
well again with every symbol with every even even word every etymology every you know all of
these things there are multiple multiple layers or levels of meaning to be extrapolated or to be
you know interpolated about you know how how we're going to understand them right and that's
what makes them so powerful and so tight and that's what makes them so interesting and so
important to study is because of how how many layers and levels of meaning there are to them
um so you know just from my own understanding alone like you know i could apply it to so many
different contexts so many different circumstances and it each in each one it is perfectly relevant
and it is um perfectly um substantiated along with the context that is being conveyed so a lot of
these things it depends upon upon the context that is being right as well as but so in in the
core essence you know the the serpent is the symbol you know of of the medical symbol of
meaning health or healing of the as the eschelius the serpent and the pole which is a single serpent
and a rod representing essentially the the staff of moses where you which represents healing and
i forget which author um i forget which author so i apologize but um he i can't remember his name
off the top of my head a friend sent me an excerpt of his or actually a pdf of his book and he
attributed it to an ancients not just mesopotamia but i i think it was that region of of jordan
and that region that arid region of the world of the levant area as well was that they had this
parasite i forget exactly which parasite is off the top of my head but it's it's a very delicate
parasite it's a long it's basically like a type of round worm maybe you know maybe even a type of
ringworm but the it caused this horrible disease and if you it was it was basically just underneath
the skin and the only way to remove it at least as far as that medical um the knowledge the
knowledge of physician um that knowledge at the time was they they basically had to take a stick
and they had to slowly wrap it around they had slowly twisted around that stick um because if
you broke a piece off then it would end up uh releasing all these toxins under the skin and
it would get infected and you would essentially you would basically die from it so it was attributed
to the symbol of healing and health or in other words you know holy holistic um health by you
know wrapping the serpent around the pole but it's got you know that's just one small tiny
layer of the entire meaning of just the health symbol alone right so it represents you know it
with the dual caduceus which the caduceus the staff of mercury mercury or hermes um is you
know that's the symbol of the dual intertwining serpents which are essentially symbolically
portrayed as a perfect phi ratio spiral um which uh intertwine around that pole which
in which applies from hindu mythology um and theology which was the kundalini serpents of
course the the two serpents of ida and pingala would wrapped around the central pole or the
central pillar what in in mythological terms is known as the axis mundi and that applies to every
culture every mythology around the world in much broader contexts and in much broader symbolism
but so um so it essentially represents it represents the human physiology itself but
not in a literal it it has a literal medical anatomical context that many people don't really
comprehend or don't really grasp the nuances of what exactly it is and how it works that's what
i'm fully encompassing and fully detailing in what i'm trying to fully compile in in my what will
be my published book but um we've covered it fully in the symbols power series but i'm trying to
directly um uh go much more into the detail about that but so the the serpent in ancient
greek was the symbol of the office um the office was symbolized as the symbol of wisdom
which we can find that in the bible as being you know the the serpent of the garden of eden who
was basically who was crafty it is um crafty most people often associate it to deception and lies
as being a snake in the grass or as being a snake oil salesman um basically someone who has
knowledge but uses that knowledge for for ill rather than for good rather than for health and
healing they use that knowledge for power and control and authority over other people's sovereignty
and their well-being and their health which is funny you know funny that we could apply that to
the pharmaceutical industry at large or the medical industry at large as well which you know
essentially for those who know is fundamentally um established by the rockefeller foundation the
carnage foundation rockefeller carnage this um this unholy union of massive financiers back in
the early 1900s which itself was a critical period of time first it was basically like a war of the
giant minds of the time i mean so many great um incredible heroes at the time of of you know
physics and science and and health and understanding well at the same time so many giants of just pure
corruption and industrial you know evil at the same time as has been you know since the beginning
of time which again goes back to the garden of eden itself the fall of man um but essentially you
know essentially most people think that the serpent is evil that it's you know it's it's
it's it's it's the devil it's lucifer it's the crafty one who you know i i mean i i can't go
into the the details off top of my head it's just too deep yeah too too nuanced and number one i don't
have all the references off the top of my head but that's okay essentially like all things you know
it represents the knowledge the tree of knowledge of good and evil there are two trees in the garden
the tree of of knowledge and the tree of good and evil there are two trees and we find that
symbolism alone all throughout um all good storytelling and um all really good mythologies
as well one of my favorites being which i i plan on writing a series about the esoterica of tolkin's
works and we find the tree works as well who was he himself basically wrote his entire
um uh his entire his own mythology he revolved that around basically an offshoot of the bible
and he made his own magical more esoteric mythological teachings around what the bible
had taught um so um so the two trees of good and of good and evil the two trees which also are
esoterically as manly p hall i think was originally probably one of the originators of of that but we
can study the medical anatomy is the the tree of the the tree of knowledge which is the central
nervous tree what's known as the the nervous tree um in the human body and medical anatomy as well as
the the tree of the tree of life which is the tree that basically makes life possible which
is the arterial system or also known as the vascular tree so these are the two trees the two
systems of basically a dendritic root systems dendrite means pertaining to a tree and i will
we'll cover this so much more in my tree of life um presentation series about the dryads the druids
essentially an offshoot of covering many nuances like nymphs and nymphomanias so many good things
going into that presentation that i've been trying to incorporate into my other um videos and films
but it's too vast to cover all in one thing we're going deep into the etymology of it all right
where the where the etymology of what the significance of the tree itself means i mean it's
so the every one of these topics is so huge that it i mean it can go on almost infinitely
pretty crazy one off shoots each one of it off shoots into its own entire so i'm as i'm trying
to document and present all of these things it's almost impossible because it just goes on forever
and to explain one thing you have to go off into a whole other you know what people call a rabbit hole
but i it's it's it's basically it's just fractal geometry is what it is these are fractal spirals
of eddy currents that that spiral off from the whole of the whole flow of what's you know life
and the universe and the electric nature of life is is is going on about so in essence that's what
the that's what the serpent represents the serpent is number one it's the sine wave of of physical
energy of energy fluid dynamics but you know the a sine wave itself is not it's not a linear thing
as as we're focused on it's a it's a everything is three-dimensional or multi-dimensional in
in its actual structure so a sine wave is actually a spherical geometry it's just a little portion a
little resonant um frequency that creates this entire spherical geometry everything in nature
is spherical and it is create i mean we can we're going way off in the tangent yeah so like we
had a myth vision we're more familiar with like the biblical esoteric wisdom um like i just started
studying this stuff astral theology about a year ago um what are your thoughts like i know in the
bible it says uh in act 722 it says moses was learned and all the wisdom of the egyptians
and so i'm wondering how are the egyptian pyramids and the temples and how are they related to
today's religions and the bible and christianity or even islam in general
okay i'll make sure i'm unmuted um okay i'm i'm sorry i kind of got lost could you repeat the
question again i yeah yeah uh so we have myth vision are more familiar with like the biblical
esoteric wisdom what are your thoughts on the egyptian pyramids and their temples and how they
they're related to today's religions okay yeah the the pyramids are you know are foundational to
you know it's not just egyptian as as most um everyone knows by now is that the pyramidal
structures are found all over the world um and specifically aligned to geometrical um
latitudes along the earth specific what are called ley lines um so but um you were referring to
to moses and um being well well versed in and containing all the wisdom of the egyptians and
that's exactly it i mean that's what this is all about it's it's known as the wisdom of the serpent
kings um being wise as serpents and the pharaohs and the egyptian kings themselves and we covered
this in symbols of power part two fully and delved a little deeper in part three as well
and um although i didn't really cover all of the things i wanted to cover there's so much more
than uh we will be going into in future films and presentations as well as that the serpent kings you
know this the serpent itself is essentially it's a symbol of of royalty it is it is the symbol of
royalty such as in ancient egypt the king cobra in in uh india as well like the king cobra which
was i mean it's a it's a massive powerful snake i mean beautiful gorgeous snake itself um so the
the royal blood lines you know considered you know in in the east in asia known as dragon lines
even some of these lay lines the the network of pyramidal structures along around the world
are also essentially known as dragon lines um so you've got dragon dragon lineage which essentially
is it's not we're not you know you can have your own interpretations but in at lifting the veil i do
not consider these literal in any sense of the term i did there's i'm not talking about literal
reptilians i'm not talking about draconians and draconian aliens i'm not talking about any of that
stuff um we are showing the the core mythology how it is deeper than that is the maybe you want to
consider that you know that's part of it as well but the the most important part of that is that
it's physiological it's anatomical it is allegorical for you know number one for electric cosmology
for which again applies to all scales both small and large but so the pyramids were you know they
were they were not these were not tombs you know as modern egyptology suggests that these are tombs
for them for the pharaohs and there's no evidence there's no substantiation to make such a claim
as that's in these the more accurate um um perspective is that you know there have been a
second cavity found in the great pyramid and there has been measured electromagnetic field
being picked up from these pyramids and they are always built typically built over an aquifer
structure of the ground of the bedrock exactly like nicola tesla built his wardencliffe tower
or his pyramid directly above the aquifers just as dr willhelm reich also conducted his study of
organomy um or the essentially harnessing the ambient energy of of the atmosphere itself
and harnessing not just the atmosphere of the earth but even larger to you know what tesla
attributed as the ether and the ancient greeks also called the ether the fifth element essentially
which is the element of spirit the fifth element fire fire air water earth and and spirit or in
other words the the life force itself of which is essentially its consciousness so these are
structures that are aligned on the earth built with locations so that they can harness the
negative ion energy of that flowing water because flowing water through a substance or through a
medium such as eroding rocks a waterfall streams um beaches you know anywhere that this water is
flowing and it's eroding over the rock it releases negative ions and that negative ion is is a
negative charge and ion is literally it's just a charged particle and so when you charge a particle
you can harness that that it's it's creating a polarity it's taking something and creating a
polarity and the whole point of the universe is created out of polarity first the universal
union the one the whole the holos the holographic universe the wholeness of the universe
interacts it creates everything in this physical universe through division it divides itself first
into into an infinite portion but it does that through duality through polarity and so it divides
itself into polarity those polarities then function and they interact they dance um they
they inter work with each other and that's what generates energy that's what generates all motion
all movement all force whether it's strong force weak force um you know all these crazy forces that
modern mainstream mathematics and physics keeps you know we discovered a new particle is no you
didn't there is there are no particles these are the same forces that have been at work
ever since the dawn of creation they're the same force is the only forces that are there
and that's the force of electricity that's literally the only force that there is it has
its offshoot it has its effect which is actually magnetism a lot of people will even associate
you know magnetism as the predecessor to electricity but you know i'm not an electrical engineer so i
don't really know that for certain but i know for certain that you know magnetism is a byproduct of
electricity you run an electric current through something and that's what creates the magnetic
field you can't i'm not certain about this but i don't think you can have magnetism without
electricity being its antecedent or its predecessor so um so the pyramids essentially
they are energy structures they are power centers they are power plants of energy which essentially
a lot of people i mean it emits this negative ionic field which number one it promotes growth
it promotes life it promotes health and healing the negative which is what negative ionic charge
does which is why you know grounding onto bare earth has such a beneficial effect for basically
for balancing our polarity balancing the electrical system of our body which is a biological electrical
battery an electrical circuit just as everything in this electric universe is and so um that's
essentially what they are and the russian experiments that have you know they built their
own i think it was a i forget what they built the pyramid out of i think it was a just a plastic
pyramid which itself is a dielectric um a dielectric substance meaning that it doesn't
actually conduct electricity itself from the dielectric means it actually it doesn't conduct
electricity it's basically it's a grounding agent but so what they discovered was that they
they basically they brought all these extinct flowers they brought some extinct species of
flowers back into bloom um just completely they didn't know that any of that was going to happen
you can store seeds you can store grain you can store anything biological will preserve itself
for a lot longer periods of time while being um housed or bathed in the energy of a pyramid
which and we'll go deep into the symbolism and the the biology and the and the physics and
you know all the other good things that all tie into as a universal science in these film series
that we're working on is that you know the human body itself as you sit in full lotus position in
a pyramidal structure or in a tetrahedral structure you are literally the conduit of the energy of
the structure of the vacuum at space of space itself which is composed of of you know tetrahedron
structures which build up essentially which are encompassed by spheres and those spheres are
packed together which creates cubes and the cube is essentially it's the box it's the container
it's the scaffold it's the structure of the fabric of space and time itself um and this gets into
sacred geometry with nasim haramines work i believe he is the first one to discover the 64 tetrahedron
grid um which was based off the off its predecessor of buckminster fuller um who discovered the uh
vector equilibrium or the cube octahedron which is essentially it's it's the the core foundational
structure of all energy all matter of space and time itself it is the structure of all biology
and um so that is essentially that's what the pyramids were for and and i mean that the mythology
all ties into that directly as well the mythologies are basically stories that are written in allegories
in parables in order to portray this timeless wisdom to tell it in a way that's sort of entertaining
ease it's distilled it's easy to grasp so that you you pass that wisdom down it's basically like a
like a trojan horse you know you pass that wisdom along embedded within that story so that it will
be preserved for those who who may forget it throughout the eons throughout the ages whether
you know cataclysms happen which wipe out you know civilizations 12 000 years ago so you lose
all your records you lose all your all your books you lose all your documentation of this knowledge
but it will be preserved orally so that the people who survive those cataclysms or those
catastrophes can reclaim that knowledge once again once you start to once it starts to
awaken from within us just as we awaken from a dream um so too does that knowledge eventually
it bubbles up it percolates forth and it comes comes through and um so that's ultimately
like you've talked a lot you've talked about like a pure consciousness before we uh come into this
realm and i can see how that's related to the zodiac cycles and even reincarnation i'm wondering
what are your thoughts on the metaphysical and some like i know in the religious charismatic
groups they have these like uh their exorcisms and i know a psychologist might call that abuse
what do you think's happening with these angels and demons and heaven and hell and all that stuff
is that just thought forms uh that space that comes from this stuff from the mythologies
or is that something that's real and uh and needs to happen
well that's an interesting topic and a very very controversial one and one that i take a very
controversial stance um that most i know almost everyone will strongly disagree with me and you
know that's okay you know i'm not trying to um to offend or challenge anyone well i'm trying to
challenge everyone's beliefs but um and that's should be everyone's goal is to challenge your
own beliefs if they don't stand up to scrutiny then you know amen then they're not true and that
applies to all you know it's funny i was literally just thinking about this in the shower when you
know i was i was just getting ready um uh was i don't i wasn't intending for that to be brought up
but um it was just going through my mind is that all things can be proven objectively even
the most metaphysical things of things the mind itself you know every belief every thoughts themselves
even if it's completely intangible spirits what have you no matter what it is in the universe if
it is true it will be proven and it can be proven and it can be proven not to even if it's just from
one angle but usually even if it's something metaphysical and you know entirely um ethereal it
has no you can't see it you can't touch it you can't measure it in any way there is it always
precipitates down into matter so there is something that you can always use to validate and substantiate
its existence and its credibility and that's that's ultimately what my my mission what my purpose
what my goal is is to take so many things that are usually just metaphysical um usually just
like a lot of fantast fantastical stories and things like that and to bring them make them
tangible to actually to where you can actually hold it in your hand you know you can point to it
you can show it to somebody else you know maybe it maybe not as a physical solid object but you
can that's the the goal of what i'm doing is to try and show people the contents of my mind
to show take my mind show it to you be like you know if i could sculpt it into an object i would
be like here you know this is this is the thought form this is literally the form of my thoughts
this is what my thoughts create and um well that's that's sort of what syncretism does right
it it proves things by looking at their relationship to everything else
exactly yeah exactly i mean so everything so the the hermetic principles of
of correspondence that you know that the the laws of cause and effect everything every effect
has a cause and so whether that cause is completely intangible you can't see it you can't touch it
you can't taste it you can't smell it if it's not observable by the senses that doesn't mean
that it doesn't exist and that definitely doesn't mean that it can't be proven because you know
it always it has an effect whether you can you can always measure it in some way shape or form
for example love you know you can't prove that love is a thing like you can't see it you can't
touch it but but yet you can experience it directly through gnosis which essentially is what
what the the the process of gnosis is it's experiential knowledge something that you experience
and by that experience you are forever changed um it literally changes the structure it's
cellular structure of your dna it changes your biology it can change your entire physiology
people can have profound transformations just you know from something as experiencing
like the honeymoon effect as dr bruce lipton shows it so greatly in his work which is profound
i mean amazing with epigenetics and all of that but um the actual question about the demonology
the demons you know that the spirits the angels and all of that that's also going to be a huge
segment in this i mean i'm trying to do a to write a comprehensive like really deep
validating it from all aspects of science that i can possibly validate it from whether it's biology
anatomy um you know even even some aspects of geology um in certain ways but um especially the
the topic of demonology i've got a full presentation that i'm still trying to produce about demonology
itself the science of demons it was basically thought forms were in ancient times they were
known as egregors or in other words you know it's a what carl yung calls the collective
unconscious or in other words uh rupert sheldrake calls it you know morphogenetic fields
basically fields of energy or in other words that the field itself the field that creates
morphology that it's basically like a field of memory a collective intelligence that we all
are constantly tapped into you know we can't get rid of it we can't hide from it we can't
run away from it we can ignore it and deny it all we want but eventually it will it will hit us
like a bolt of lightning and it will come forth from within us um but so ultimately you know
everything that we think everything that we speak everything that we say you know people
can take this literally as it becomes real in a sense that and i don't mean that necessarily in
a literal sense i mean that in in a sense that everything we think you know we we speak those
things that we think that we believe to somebody else and somebody else has the choice to either
believe that or to not believe that and that's where objectivity and subjectivity comes in
weighing those two balances subjectivity only exists within the greater reality of objectivity
in other words the universe is objective it's not something that we can you know that it changes
depending on what we think it is and we can prove that scientifically that's what um randomized
double blind plus cbo controlled trials are four is you control all the variable factors
that rule out belief that rule out you know what you think what you want it to be the end
there is still a measurable objective effect regardless of your belief or what you you know
what you want to believe in most people especially in the new age and the metaphysical community
cannot accept that they will not accept that can't accept as being true and yet it is true
you know there is an objective the universe is objective reality is objective but our subjective
perception exists within that greater reality what we perceive what we want what we think to be true
only exists because there is it actually an objective reality that we all share within you
know and that is what the sacred geometry of the flower of life actually is we are each of us is
a is a spherical boundary we are a boundary condition just like any cell and any organism
in existence it has a boundary that's what the skin is it is our membrane it is our physical
boundary separating the outer world from the inner world within our bodies and so um essentially
you know that is that is how we operate in this world so so the concept of demons and angels and
all of that it's it's what you want it to be you know you can have your subjective interpretation
but you know ultimately there are thought forms but those thought forms are basically they're just
collective human beliefs they're they're egregors and egregor is a collective belief and you can find
this in in all the so many stories so many fairy tales especially um one of the most prominent off
the top of my head is um there is a movie called um uh rise of the guardians which is basically you
know all your mythological characters santa claus the easter bunny um you know what have you on on
on and on and so forth you know these are all characters that are enlivened through our stories
through our myths through our collective um storytelling and so some they all are based
on actual real truths and those truths are not literal they're not an actual person that existed
they're not a deity that exists in some metaphysical dimension these are things that are tangible
but they are allegories for real things that we experience in life in our experiences of life
that we can point to directly in our physiology in our biology you know and we i could go into
the specifics of each one of them but that again that opens up a huge pandora's box that you know
yeah we don't need to do so i'm just trying to have to kind of give an overarching theme here but
for example demons um in ancient times their their effects exorcisms and all of that is basically
it's all psychological health it's all about mental health and bodily health and bodily well-being
holistic holy health holos whole that's what it's all about so these these the the serpent and the
garden of eden um the the demons and all of that it's all about parasites when when in the body
from eating a high meat high fat animal based um uh what nowadays is become processed foods but in
ancient times they didn't have processed foods it was all about the diseases of kings of royalty
which were you know the the seven vices rather than being transmuted into the seven virtues
things like gluttony and you know essentially and killing other animals eating these unhealthy foods
that and you know this is a whole rabbit hole in and of itself so you know i can't go into the
specifics about diet health nutrition and all of that here but that is ultimately what it's all about
is you know we we live in unhealthy lifestyle and that opens you up to be preyed upon by those
parasites because everything can only survive in the environment and that is conducive for that
thing to survive in so in other words you can only harbor parasites if you're the environment is there
to keep them there same as the gut microbiome i mean you can take all the probiotics in the world
but if you're not eating the starchy heavily resistant starch based foods like legumes beans
um potatoes yams rice whole grains all of those foods that especially the you know most people
demonize whether you're from the low carb the paleo the the raw food camp but i don't care it's
everyone's demonizing the core like the healthiest foods of all the healthiest populations of the
world that we're consuming those foods that keep a healthy environment that keep your mental health
clear so in other words these exorcisms these healings are basically they're healing people's
physiology it's number one is casting out the serpent it's casting out the demon which is it's
it means it's cleansing your physical body so that it's no longer conducive to harbor parasites
and pathogens whether that's bacterial pathogens or whether that's actual worms flatworms roundworms
flukes um etc or what have you the actual demon the real demon that is within us and these these
demons these parasites these literally they literally they control your mind they release chemicals
that tell you what to eat so that it feeds them rather than your own health so that it will feed
them at their expense at the expense of your longevity and your health so they they literally
produce chemicals that control the minds of their host and so that is ultimately what it all is right
there but there's many other allegories that the demons apply to the the topic of angels
applies specifically i mean that's a that's a big one in and of itself but it applies
essentially to the zodiac but it applies also within the physiology of the human body once again
there's multiple layers you know there's a macrocosmic layer a huge layer that encompasses a smaller
layer that's contained within it and it's fractal and it goes you know who knows maybe essentially
infinite but these there are many layers around these things and so that's essentially what the
disinformation the misinformation the allegories are all about the parables are all about it's
convey this core truth it's like a you know you try to feed the truth to a dog you know you try to
feed something to a dog you have to wrap it in in what it you know what it wants you have to
feed the medicine to them wrap in a piece of bacon or something you know so you're giving them that
pill that that truth wrapped in that in that garbage that garbage that facade that exoteric
interpretation that basically number one if you take it literally like that you're you're you're
kept on the outer in the outer um the exo you're kept ex communicated from the inner temple the
inner house of wisdom that inner esoteric group of knowledge which is is what the core truth is
yeah sorry i'm going off on tangents that's all right i got i just want to say like i think
everybody takes some of the text uh metaphorically and everybody takes some of it literally and i
say that because i was studying uh the end times doctrines and there was like uh the the main one
i've been studying was recently is the preterist view and uh basically the preterist they take
the time statements in the bible literally but they'll take all the apocalyptic language metaphorically
so they're already beginning this journey of understanding okay what do these metaphors mean
what's this typology that's happening um and and and i realized that uh the futurists were taking
the apocalyptic language literally in the time statements metaphorically so everybody's already
taking something metaphorically um but we just haven't harmonized the thought that's why i love
syncretism so much is we're getting back to the ancient greek way of thinking which looks at the
relatedness of of all things this is the logos right this is the pythagorean way of thinking
and and i'm wondering like okay how did it get so bad that everybody's was taking the apocalyptic
language literally and and uh so we've been exploring uh some of like this roman provenance
theory where the romans were trying to dominate these other cultures religions and they would
basically create their own religion uh what are your thoughts on um like the politics behind christianity
yeah um honestly that's not one of my specialties okay that's not that's not really what i'm the
best at um i'm i'm not i that's that's one of my flaws is i'm not a historian like i'm not really
too concerned i'm not interested in like the history of things not i'm interested in the
history of some things but not like actual cultural history itself like i'm not big on you
know time on timelines i'm not big on dates i'm not big on right what actual fluidity and
content continuity of of a transmission of of things like that but i like to focus on just the
more abstract things and uh and sort of correlate those with the the more detailed aspects of it
but um yeah that that is a huge one is you know for any ruling culture you know they you basically
first of all you you you have to divide the culture amongst itself you know same way that
all division functions in the universe you first have to divide it amongst itself and in other
words a basically a separation and that's literally what um you know that's literally what secret
actually means at its root word in latin this secret means to separate um so in other words
that's where where we get the word secretion from is basically you know because you're secreting
something which is separating something off from the whole um so in other words that's that's how
you how you first basically penetrate that you know basically you know think of a sphere of
influence a sphere of knowledge and you first have to penetrate that you have to divide that that
thing into um amongst itself you have to divide that populace amongst itself the way you do that
is through a separation so the way you do that is through uh essentially disinformation and you
know these these uh these masters these learned elders these elites these elites of the ancient
traditions you know they are the masters of of psychology they're the um essentially they're the
the fathers and the originators of the science and the study of psychology which itself means the
science of the soul um the study of the soul um psyche meaning literally meaning soul um from
the greek goddess psyche um but so so essentially what they have to do is they have to divide the
populace amongst itself the way they do that is by number one um demonizing the the old traditions
you know the old gods you know and we find this in george martin's you know a song of ice and fire
you have as well as many other you know um uh lovecraft also you know describe this a lot as well
you know that you have to separate the old gods demonize the old gods and or in other words the
old way of life you know the traditional ways of life the the common traditions where we were all
essentially originally we were all a functional human human species we all had the same goals the
same um the same purpose on earth and number you know originally that was just to survive
you know it was basically to you know cultivate our food on the land you know maintain a healthy
population which consisted of our family our immediate family became our larger community and
all of those things so so the way they did that was you know they first demonized the old ways
and you know start call and you know start demonizing paganism which is essentially that's our
that is our true foundation our true roots of all of these cultures all these theologies all
these religions are wrapped basically they're they're wrapped their lies wrapped around a core
truth that is embedded more holistically in paganism is more fundamentally closer to the truth
than any of the other religions that are wrapped around it and that encompass that core truth um
so that's they understood that and the way they did that was they incorporated the old ways first
of all they they created a new they fabricated a new story i mean and that in of itself is is
one of the larger i mean i don't even i can't even fathom how someone can be intelligent and you
know have the drive and the will and the desire enough to do something like that to create an
entirely new you know belief system an entirely new religion you know it it basically starts with a
wild imagination and you know for for many parts but it's not really i mean i mean when you think
about wild stuff like like Mormonism like and all is all these various offshoots of Christianity
you know some of them can be very especially Scientology itself by you know Elbert i mean
that that is one right there like how do you create an entirely new religion like that well
number one you have to be a very profound liar and deceiver which he was provably i mean even
Alistair Crowley wouldn't touch that guy he wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole he was like that guy
is a fake he's a fraud he's a chill and i mean that's so that's is that says a lot for someone
like Alistair Crowley to even like disapprove of of of what you're doing and that's a that's a wild
story in and of itself but so um so yeah that's what they did was that they encompassed all the
universal truths about nature about the functions of the cycles the seasons when to when to plant
when to when to reap when to sow when to harvest um and you know that's very basic but the the
science of nature and and astrophiology gets very very technical and you know it's not complex
it's not hard to understand but it can it can get very very deep and uh and very nuanced so but
that's ultimately the overarching simplicity is all about the cycles of of time of the seasons of
nature and the cycles of of nature itself which is this uh correlates to the cycles of consciousness
though the wakefulness and the sleepfulness um the dream state and the alert state and you know
that's how all things in the universe go from ebbs and flows cycles of expansion and contraction
magnets is a centrifugal divergent and centripetal convergence you know it's or centripetal
convergence centrifugal divergence it's all a universal dynamic it's a torus dynamic to put
it essentially that's how i mean it encompasses everything in in existence but so you know that's
that's ultimately how you do it is is you basically encompass people's you have to steal their roots
from them and then you have to sell it back to them is ultimately what roam was the master of
i mean roam was that was and they got all this from the Phoenicians you know the
roam wasn't the originators of any of these you know uh high priesthood traditions they
they got all of their core foundational um societal tenets from the Phoenicians who preceded them
and them from the Babylonians and the Chaldeans and the Sumerians who preceded them and you know
we're not going to go by a mainstream linear timeline because you know number one that's
actually incorrect but at some point and number two nobody actually knows how it actually went i
mean we can study the best historians that we have documentation of but ultimately we still
don't even we can't even trace that fully because the Vatican is hoarding all of it in the in the
catacombs underneath you know underneath their um underneath the Vatican mount but so i mean yeah
about that like i heard that um well somebody actually told me a couple weeks ago that uh
he's talking about the burning of the library in Alexandria and i'm like did that so i was like
oh yeah that happened and like well it happened a couple times it seemed like in history where they
it was kind of progressive and it was as christianity or monotheism came along they had to get rid
of these opposing views but i heard that the Vatican didn't actually burn it all down there
like we want to keep this and they would they're storing it now so i don't know have you looked
into that much or no um i haven't studied it um in depth like in detail like i haven't gone through
and actually studied that you know one unique thing but yeah i mean right yeah yeah i mean the
story of hypatia of alexandria is just appalling i mean it's such a such a compelling story um but
yeah of course you know that these conquering cultures i mean unless they're truly you know if
someone is not wise they will destroy the information entirely but if they're wise as
serpents yet definitely not also gentle as doves you know that's what it's all about ultimately
is the goal is to be wise as servants have the wisdom of the serpent kings um yet also have the
the core morality the core tenets of you know of philosophy to also be gentle as doves you're
a powerful you contain the ability to destroy anything in sight yet you have the morality
and the and the choice the free will choice to to align yourself with natural law and to never do so
because you understand the vast implications of of what will um become of not just yourself but what
will become of the entire function of the universe itself if you do that you're going against the
entire structure of the universe which is a living organism it's a living body it's a whole organism
and you destroy certain parts of it or even just one part of it and the whole thing breaks down and
you basically you destroy you know everything by extension of that so um but yeah so of course
they didn't destroy all of that information and of course they have been hoarding that although
you know they ultimately they didn't have to anyways i mean they had the knowledge to begin with
you know the this core priesthood this elite um priest class are the ones who they they not
and only did they like discover all this knowledge that they're the ones who were writing it they
were documenting it these were the vast scientists of the ancient world they were the astronomers
the cosmologists they were the physicians of their days you know these were the the elite
minds of of the ancient world so of course they were the ones who you know compiled all this
knowledge and yet somewhere somehow along the way and you know i i used to think i i knew how
you know how it all worked but you know the more i'm learning i'm like i have no idea how it works
now you know so i'm kind of that i'm in a transition phase right now in between my you know i'm in a
period of mental chaos in between my state of order you know right um but so and that's what we
all go through we go through levels of growth and in between those those you know levels of growth
there's a there's a vast you know everything is chaos in between you know just as symatics goes
but yeah i was thinking people we almost need to have psychology taught in our schools or maybe
at a high school level so people can be prepared because like what the these big psychologists
like steve asan are saying is um like people are actually more vulnerable than they think they are
and there was that movie on netflix who's called the experimenter where he's experimenting to see
how much people will obey an authoritative figure in the room even though it's an immoral or an evil
thing that they're doing like applying shocks exactly yeah um i recently watched a really good
remake of the from the stanford prison experiment um it was by um i forget um really popular youtube
channel um and it was great like it was a really one of the best um you know independent like um
shows that i've i've seen in a while i'm seeing he attempted to recreate the stanford prison
experiment and um it's a lot harder to do nowadays than it was you know back in the in the 70s when
they did it um basically because you know people are a lot more they're they're basically not as
willing to go along with authority as as you know we used to be just even you know a couple
century a couple uh decades ago but uh but yeah it's very interesting yeah so so people will
definitely um you know and there's there's still you know most people the majority of people in the
world are caught and sucked into appeal to authorities you know authority figures is you
know you look to someone else because you don't you don't feel like you're worthy enough within
yourself to you know to number one be capable of learning or of of um embodying the principles of
someone like for example like like you know like jesus you know as he said you know so these things i
do so too shall you do and greater things shall you do you know so of course that's always been
the teaching the core teaching is that you know we all have a greatness within us and you know
etymologically this goes back and mythologically this goes back to you know the genius the etymological
roots of of the genius is it's it's literally the the the tutelary deity the tutelary spirit
you know it's it's essentially it's literally the your guiding spirit it is your conscience
it is that that that intelligence within that tells you when something is right and wrong or wrong
and it's which we experience as a gut as a gut feeling like every time you you know you've done
something like really wrong your gut just it wrenches it twists and you can feel it in the in
your enteric brain you're literally your enteric neurons which send that signal um that neural pathway
from the nervous or the vagus nerve up into the brain which has a much broader pathway from the gut
to the brain than it does from the brain to the gut so it's basically working its way up it's
basically like you know sending that signal up or in other words it's sending that message up to the
brain it's sending that message from hell from the bowels of hell to the heights of of heaven
within the physiology which is what is which is the role of mercury of hermes that's that's
hermes's job he's the messenger but who can pass between the underworld the underworld in heaven
he's the intermediary which is what the nervous system is the nervous system alchemically was
ruled by essentially was was you know was ruled by mercury it's not we're not talking literal here
we're not like oh you've got mercury you know running through your vein you know running through
your nervous system but although you know most people are to do have mercury running through
their nervous system right because of the bio accumulation of you know of toxins and of mercury
you know which comes essentially through animal foods specifically and solely through animal
foods which i've covered in vast depth on on uh not just my written presentations but i finally
got a actual video out about that i've been trying to do videos about that forever and it's a huge
topic also yeah so that's a big one regarding the physiology and health and again what causes the
mental illness was what causes those you know those demons within us you're hearing you know
your schizophrenic your autistic all of these things are usually start begin within the gut
they begin in the with the enteric system that the microbiome which is not even you know it's
not even our body that's it's an organism of of microorganisms of bacteria and i mean the human
body what we consider ourselves which you are what i am you know i am not what i think i am i'm
actually just a giant congregation of mostly bacteria mostly viruses we are literally mostly
composed of viruses um then mostly composed of bacteria and then mostly composed of our own cells
but so most of what we're made of is not even what we consider to be us but yet you know these
organisms are within us and it's a homeostatic system it's a it's a holistic system that gives
and takes and you know um the the microbiome is literally it's the cutting edge of of science
and and health and well-being now um that is that is where the future of health and understanding of
basically all health and disease begins and ends in the gut yeah and i think people can understand
that better like if they read the church when they're reading the new testament what is the church
right what did jesus call christianity he said it's the body right so so and paul talks about it as
you are you're each like does an eye compare himself to a finger right so it's it's actually
talking about those things and it's talking about the actual body and so you can actually
read it like that and begin to see some of this stuff and the astrophysiology like in the lord's
prayer even he says may it be on earth as it is in heaven well what is heaven and what is earth
so like we need to define our terms and according to that sort of pagan historical context of the
astrophysiology and i think people will start to get it yeah exactly um you know that's what most
people don't don't grasp is that you know they'll they'll demonize you know hermeticism and you know
and esoterica as being oh it's it's it's that's from the you know that's that's satanic that's
from the devil that's you know it's evil and you know the truth is it's the same it's the exact
same thing that's it's the actual truth of what the scriptures are saying it's yeah on on earth as
it is in heaven in other words the hermetic principle and as above so below is the exact same
that's where the that's where the biblical scripture comes from is from the actual
gnostic gospels um the which itself comes from a much more ancient um teaching um but yeah so
that's exactly what it is and again it it doesn't know it applies number one it applies metaphorically
to the things that we experience in our day-to-day lives and in our interactions and
relationships with each other as well as our relationship with our self with our own you
know in our own mental um mental sphere our own mental kingdom if you will a kingdom literally
means a sphere of influence so what would you say to somebody who's just beginning their spiritual
journey they're thinking about going to some different churches and studying some different views
like how does somebody start to discern this stuff because i know it's really complex and it takes a
long time so would yes it is um honestly um well i would say first of all start cross referencing
like everything you read everything you hear start with the first start with the the actual the
quadribium and as well as combined with the trivium start with the seven liberal arts in other words
how we can come to know you know the basic fundamentals of the world that we live in our
reality our existence in this world and what we're supposed to be you know um contributing to the
world and that is you know the the quadribium the study of music astronomy um mathematics um as well
as the um i forget the fourth one i'm sorry i'm not too great with these off the top of my head but
you know and then the trivium of logic which is rhetoric um logic and philosophy or you know i
probably got a couple of those wrong off the top of my head but it's basically that's that's what we
need to be you know how we can know ourselves and to know the truth and to know the truth is to apply
that basically what essentially is essentially it's the scientific method you know people nowadays
just do not trust science whatsoever they hate science they openly denounce science and yes
science is most science has been hijacked and corrupted and is and is um is flawed it's most
of its disinformation although you can't like people hate science and this is part of the huge
battle that sorry to bring this up but it's part of the battle that i'm going like right on right now
like everything i do and everything i'm trying to share and present and teach is like the the main
thing that i like i'm battling against is people who hate science and when i say they hate science i
mean they literally think that opinion hearsay and personal anecdote in equals one studies which
literally means that you know they're they're performing experiments on themselves by trial
and error you know all these things that is not how to get to the truth for people who are seeking
you know who are seeking to validate the teachings of the bible or any other religion
start first with these core tenets of you know how to think how to apply those things you know
logically and rationally with substance with evidence use rules of evidence understand the
hierarchy of evidence um so in other words what makes the most credible um argument what makes
the most credible case for your stance for your position um and start to try to actually substantiate
your beliefs you know the things that you hear the things that you're taught the things that you're
told um go through and actually fact check them for yourself cross-reference things but this requires
you know most people don't have the skill set to be able to even begin to know how to do those things
but you know so that's why it's an ongoing process it's an ongoing journey you know we're
ongoing it's an ongoing spiral to that pinnacle of the mountain which you know it's a false what's
in if you're a mountain climber it's known as a false horizon you're a false summit you know as
you think you're getting to the peak of the summit you realize that there's no you're
it's not done yet you still got a all-long way to go yeah you get to the top of the pyramid and
realize there's another one on top of it so yeah that's a sort of picture I might get to the top
of the pyramid realize it's been truncated yeah and there's another pyramid that's elevated a loft
in the air that you literally can't even get to because it's you know a loft in the air but that
pyramid itself is the the capstone itself which is in and of itself is just another
truncated pyramid so again it's that fractal essence and to get to that next to that truncated
you know to the capstone to the pinnacle to the apex to what biblically is called the chief
the chief cornerstone and who was the chief cornerstone oh Jesus Christ was the chief
he was the chief cornerstone he wasn't just the cornerstone of the church
which is just a typical stone on the corner he was the chief cornerstone which is the capstone
which is the pinnacle the peak enlightenment the knowledge the apex the the apex or the
multiple plural apices just as the egyptian apis bull represented the sun once again so
i mean so the process is never-ending it's ongoing it's a never-ending journey it's a
never-ending story as you mentioned at the very beginning um when we're talking about the serpent
i forget exactly what you saw what the the if that was from scripture or the quote but you
know the beginning will be the end yeah that's isaia 4610 he's talking about god will make
known the end from the beginning right so the whole bible is one big cycle it's all about these
that's exactly that's it's talking about the oraboris the serpent which literally is greek for
certain for tail is tail eating essentially means tail devouring so in other words it's
never-ending cycle of where something starts and it also ends it's an ongoing circle it is it is a
circle it is a circuit it is a cycle and from kyclos me or greek kyclos which literally means
circle or which means circuit so it's an electrical battery of of energy of life that
is continual it's ongoing and that's you know what we should seek to model our lives after is
you know is the fundamental um not just the structure but the energetic nature of of the
fabric of the universe itself and that's what you know our mind and our goals should all be about
well it looks like we're running out of time um how can we find your work i guess we have your
patreon account patreon.com forward slash lifting the veil his youtube channel uh you can find on
youtube is uh lifting the veil as well and he's on facebook uh can people contact you on facebook
lifting the veil official or on your personal account yeah the facebook um handle is at
lifting the veil official that's also my instagram account as well my twitter is something is a
different one um i should just make it all the same but it's not but anywhere you'll you'll
find you know there is a lot of other people especially on facebook there's a guy who just
started a page who literally um started lifting the veil and i was like hey dude it's actually
i'm registering my trademark that's literally my trademark brand it's registered and you can't
you know can't do that number one because it makes people people are thinking is that my page
yeah well i think i think i just found that one actually today and i've done literally years and
years of hard labor to build this you know to build this work that i'm doing and you know for
somebody else to just come along and piggyback off it that's why it's literally it's a trademark
infringement um but yeah so uh you can it's easy to find me um either cohen smith lifting the veil
um you'll you'll you'll know the difference between what's my stuff and what's not my stuff um
because you'll you'll obviously be able to see the discern the the difference in um in the riding
style um in the way i i piss a lot of people off but you know my sense of my sense of humor my
my crude language which i like to incorporate because i like to keep myself you know i like to
i you know i used to not use you know crude language or anything but you know i've sort of
like loosened up on myself and been like you know what we need to have some fun here people
you know and i like to sort of challenge people now um in a sense that like i i think people need
to toughen up you know i think the way to toughen people up is to be like you know things aren't
always going to be as as nice and as sweet as you want them to be you know it wakes people up a
little bit right so yeah yeah i i feel that you know that's a lot of more of the energy that i bring
is is sort of it's is i like to shake things up that need to be shaken up and shaken out of a habit
and out of a pattern and then you know you can restructure and re-solidify yourself into you
know a new way of and into a new lifestyle a new way of thinking into a new mindset so you know it's
it's just about that i'm trying to initiate a transition you know and of the mind of the
consciousness and of the physical body itself as well and you know that the reason why is because
that's what i had to go through in order to really to realize you know this true potential that we are
meant to to be operating at and that we are meant to reach and that we can reach it is within reach
the truth can be known the truth will always be known it cannot be hidden it cannot be covered up
and you know the way to do that is to is to we have to do the self-work we have to know thyself
otherwise we can't really know anything else around us but it's it's a do it's a two-way
street you know you can also learn to know thyself by knowing your surroundings you know that's
that's what science is for science is knowing the things around us knowing the world around us by
studying them by dissecting them and by examining them while gnosis is the experience of knowing
from within through direct experience so these are the two pillars of of truth and knowledge is
science and gnosis the two ways of science literally means to know from the root word of
latin of of sh i forget how it's pronounced technically so um any professional linguists
out there you know don't crucify me but see that i think it's sheer sheer sheer a means to know
but that's by knowing by external means by studying things and you know dissecting the parts and by
studying the parts you can understand the whole but gnosis is the other way around it's knowing the
whole and thereby being able to observe the parts that it influences so well i think that's a good
place to end the show um i just want to say thanks for joining us today i'm glad to have you
maybe we can do something again and uh yeah you know where to find us all right know the truth and
the truth will set you free uh bye everybody
