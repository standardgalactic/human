Hey, I don't know if you were made aware that we have a second channel,
MythVisionTV.
I hope you go over there.
We're going to do monthly recaps on a lot of the content I do here on the big
channel, but there's also going to be unique material over there that you won't
find here. Be sure to go subscribe, check it out.
I want you to check out a little clip here today because I think that you'll
appreciate it, a lot of long format content.
If you're looking for it, we're going to be having it over there at MythVisionTV.
So stay tuned, check out this clip and I hope to see you subscribe to our second
channel.
Next up is Dr. Richard C. Miller on the MythVision podcast.
Richard Miller is a humanistic scholar of Christian origins in the ancient
Hellenistic and Roman world.
I went to Biola University.
I met with James Charles where he said, where did you do your your prior work?
And I told him Biola. He said, Biola what?
He had no idea what that was.
That's William Lang Craig's, you know, Academy.
Well, I think that Miller's remarks should be a real wake up call for Christians.
Oh, well, obviously this person doesn't understand that there is positive
historical evidence concerning the life and teachings of Jesus.
But not only is there no evidence for Santa Claus, but we have very, very powerful
evidence against him.
OK, what are you waiting for?
I hope to see you here.
Subscribe over there on our second channel.
We have so many plans.
So don't miss out and never forget we are MythVision.
