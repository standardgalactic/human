10k subscribers for MythVisionTV, that's our second channel in case you didn't know.
If you want to listen to long format content of what we do here at MythVision or Recaps,
go check it out.
Subscribe to the channel.
You can also turn it on for background noise.
I don't know.
Some of you might want to be working and listening or you might just want to go to sleep.
Sometimes I know how that goes.
You just listen to me long enough, you might go to sleep.
We plan on rolling out more.
I have a long interview I just did with Robin Faith Walsh that's out there.
Long documentary.
I've done this with others as well.
So check us out.
It's also another way of helping support the channel just by watching the content, liking
this stuff, engaging.
Let me know in the comments your thoughts if you've been over there already and I hope
to see more of you go and check out the second channel.
We've got a lot of stuff coming so stay tuned.
Thank you.
