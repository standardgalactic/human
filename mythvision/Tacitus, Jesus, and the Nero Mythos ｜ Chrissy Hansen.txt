Tacitus's work was actually lost, almost. Where did Tacitus actually get this information
from? And theories are endless. Several scholars do not think even if there was an authentic
core that we can even retrieve that core.
Welcome back to MythFish and Podcast. I'm your host, Derek Lambert. Does Tacitus have
independent knowledge of the historical Jesus? Or is he dependent on some other information?
Today, I have a special guest, Chrissy Hansen. Welcome back to MythFission.
Hi, it's been a while.
It has. And the last time you came on, you did this. Honestly, I didn't even expect unbelievable
deep dive into this history of mythicism. So if you're interested in seeing that development,
we do have the video. It's a few years old, it seems, a year and a half or so.
More than that. I think that was back in 2020.
Wow, it's been that long.
Yeah.
Well, you did a fantastic job. You have this great memory all off the head. You were just
going into the history and taking us through all the way to contemporary times with mythicism.
And this topic today that you're going to discuss is actually somewhat related in the
whole historical Jesus question. So before we do dive in, you wrote this article. Tell
us about your background, what you're researching a little bit about yourself as we introduce
your article.
Awesome. So for those who don't know then, I am a researcher, mostly a, I describe myself
mostly as a hobbyist in biblical studies. I don't have any advanced credentials in the
field, but I do have a rather in a significant number of publications in it now. By the end
of this year, I should have over 20 peer-reviewed publications, most of which are all to do with
Jesus studies, early Christian martyrdom and persecution narratives, and also stepping
into other fields as well. One of my, the book project I'm now working on that I have
contracted with Whitfins Talk is going to be all on whether or not Philemon is authentic.
So lots of different stuff there. I also research Tolkien studies and have a paper published
on that and a few other different topics. So I'm kind of all over the place. It's just
whatever fits my interests in the moment. I am currently a grad student at University
of Nebraska at Carney and studying English. My background is primarily very conservative
Christian. I was raised in the pre-Methodist Church initially. My family had been a part
of the pre-Methodist Church since the 1890s and come from a long line of pastors and theologians.
I left the faith after I started college probably my second year is why I basically stopped attending
church for the most part. My last bid was Catholicism actually. I considered converting
and was talking with a priest about it for a while. So yeah, my current background is
that I am a polytheist. That is a whole different journey that we do not have time for but that
is essentially where I'm at. So I came to doing my paper on Tastus at first specifically
because I wanted to talk about Tastus in relation to the historical Jesus.
And then it just completely grew beyond that and then I launched into early Christian martyrdom
and persecution narratives instead. You're writing some fantastic stuff. I've been enjoying
seeing you write not only on social media with some of the arguments that are made here and there
on some of these groups but also in these articles. So the article that you have today right now is
on Tastus and really the question of where did he get his information about Jesus,
Christians and such which takes us straight into this early I guess you'd say apologetic
anti-apologetic arena that is definitely used online. Many of the Christian apologists will
reference these sources to go here's proof that Jesus existed. Now I want to phrase it this way
because as we get into this article I want you to tell us about the different positions and how
you have kind of tackled these and come to a conclusion but I also want to mention like you're
not a mythicist. You think there was most likely a Jesus however you're still taking a position
that I think most people tend to go hey they use this as a tool to prove or argue that Jesus existed.
Yeah yeah I am definitely a historicist. A lot of my publications are specifically
taking on different mythicist positions and what's interesting is that even though I'm not a
mythicist when it comes to the vast majority of what they talk about I for the most part agree.
I don't think Tastus is a good or any of the extra biblical sources are actually useful for
establishing the history of Jesus. I don't think any of the references in Josephus are actually
authentic. Additionally I do not think that the Gospels can be taken as historical sources for
reconstructing Jesus's life in any regard and I tend to be more on the mimesis criticism end of
things with Dennis McDonald and Richard C. Miller and others like that. So it's I am very much of
the opinion that mythicists for the most part have been actually in my opinion ahead of the curve
on a lot of stuff. You go back all the way into the 1800s Bruno Bauer and others like that are
already proposing that the Gospels are stemming from stoic and Platonist ideas and they're just
being completely discarded by most scholars of their era and now scholars are coming back around
like no actually there's definitely a lot of stoic and Platonist influence on in the New Testament.
So where I'm coming from is certainly not an apologetic standpoint. I really honestly don't
care if Jesus existed. A piece of writing I'm working on right now is my argument that I don't
think the historical Jesus is even relevant for understanding Christian origins. So whether he
existed or not is to me a complete side issue and a very little historical consequence.
When it comes to Attacitus there's still that debate and there's still a huge debate within
Jesus' studies and especially with those apologists you mentioned. They really want to
use Attacitus and imbue him with great care as a historian, make him one of these amazing,
well like uncharacteristically scrupulous for his time. It's strange but it's not something that
even originates with apologists. It stems mostly out of early and mid 20th century work that
really promoted Attacitus as this great historian and it's something that's kind of been inherited
over time. Attacitus's work was actually lost almost. The fact that we have what we have is kind
of a miracle because during the reign, during around the third and fourth centuries actually his
work was in fairly poor repute. Very few people were actually using it and citing it and it actually
but one emperor who claimed to be a descendant of his ended up having to instantiate an attempt to
actually revive and recopy his work because manuscripts were in poor condition. They weren't
being reused very much and in fact it's also the case that they weren't even always aware of all
his works. So some writers like Tertullian and others do cite Attacitus but they only cite his
histories. They don't cite the annals which makes it very clear that these works were not all in
equal circulation and they also were not in that great repute. So it's not until much later and I
think partially on the basis of Annals chapter 15 part 44 or book 15 chapter 44 my bad is that
that section on Jesus I think is probably one the major reasons why his repute has been consistently
revived and promoted since then. Spent around the fourth and fifth centuries we finally see his
work being revived again and then he's finally cited on the persecution of Christians by Sulpicius
Severus. Wow so he he's cited on the persecution of Christians later. You wrote another article I'm
sure we'll tiptoe into just to tease people but we will have another episode we're gonna actually
discuss that particular issue which I loved Candida Moss's book The Myth of Persecution.
I actually teared up reading a section about one of the female, I can't remember the name in the
Greek world where she actually was tricked by her king father into being married but really didn't
and they were sacrificing her to get the wind to blow so their ships could leave harbor or
something you would know probably than I would more than I would but anyway a great book but this
question of Tacitus there are several hypotheses if I could put it that way of like how he got
Christian ideas how does he know about these Christians how does he know about Jesus and
they they range from this guy like in fact has like the most higher upper echelon documentation
from the court so this is good stuff this is like you can't get any more historically accurate
information to this guy is borrowing from Josephus to a hypothesis that you propose and so I don't
want to say yeah I want you to elaborate on what are the hypotheses which ones have things going
for them more than others and then let's let's nail this one down. Yeah so the first half of my
paper on Tacitus is actually dealing with all these previous theories you mentioned on where did
Tacitus actually get this information from and theories are endless people speculate about this
all over the place one of the more prominent ones that's been coming up a little bit recently
it's been promoted as possible by Steve Mason by Dave Allen and it was also in the past argued for
by Frans Dornseif in his article Lukas der Schriftsteller mit einem Anhang Josephus und Tacitus
this is the essential argument is that we can point out some pretty close parallels
in their opinions between Tacitus's text on Jesus specifically what he says about Jesus
and also what Josephus writes in the Testimonium Flopianum now this is a tricky argument because
one major problem is it is entirely hinged on whether or not we know anything about the
Testimonium Flopianum and it can be reconstructed accurately several scholars do not think that
we even if it was off there was an authentic core that we can even retrieve that core and you can
see why because there's several different ways to reconstruct it Alice Wheely thinks that almost
the entire thing is authentic Ulrich Victor and Samuel's inner think the entire thing is authentic
and then you have you know like John P Meyer who argued for a neutral original and excises
various passages like he was the Christ and stuff like that and then you have another subgroup Dave
Allen Fernando Bermejo Rubio and others who are arguing that instead it was a negative
Testimonium but even between all of these different neutral positive and negative reconstructions
there's some reconstructions within each of these groups no one agrees on how to reconstruct this
passage really John Myers is probably the most popular way of doing that but that's come under
some scrutiny again Wheely critiques it Ken Olson has very vociferously critiqued it and I actually
agree with him that it's probably completely inauthentic with no core so it is hinged on some
rather problematic assumptions to begin with but it gets even worse you actually look at these
parallels and you realize these are really general points like anything that Tastis says
looks almost identical to what you could find in like a Christian Cretal statement and Ken Olson
elsewhere pointed out actually a very close specific summation that's actually in Justin
martyrs work almost identical as well so you can very easily see that this could come from anywhere
um what also is problematic is that there's no evidence that Tastis ever used Josephus's
antiquities the arguments for his reliance on uh on Josephus are primarily from the Jewish war
and with regard to Tastis's work the histories in chapters four and five when we look at those
parallels there are some that line up somewhat closely and Steve Mason has argued for them
in more detail in other works I don't buy them personally there's also some substantial differences
like they don't agree on who kills various figures they don't agree on the numbers of the dead who
perish in the siege all in fact anytime numbers come up Tastis and Josephus never agree and there's
also other things like in the very same passage in the histories Tastis talks about the origins of
the Jewish people and nothing he says you can find you can find anywhere in Josephus but you
know where you can find those origin stories in other Greco-Roman sources it doesn't look like in
my opinion he's using Josephus and on top of it Roman authors hated Josephus um this is a point
that Ken Olsen brought up uh I also and he pointed uh to Zetoneus and I there's also a reference
in Cassius Dio as well it's just no one would probably utilize Josephus without saying something
really negative things about him because they usually do anytime he pops up they don't have
nice things to say they kind of just keep him as like a as like attaching himself to Vespasian
like he's like clamoring at his heels and is it's not a good picture at all and they don't
like Jewish people in general they only have awful things to say about Jewish people all the time
sounds like not a lot has changed in the world no um in fact a lot of the anti-Semitic polemics
that we have today come from Roman polemics as well um wow like and you'll see also some parallels
with polemics Romans would use with Christians also Justin Sledge actually talked about this in one
of his videos um that a lot of Christian anti-Semitic polemics originate with anti-Christian
polemics Romans used against them uh it's really interesting there's a lot of stock utilization
of insults and stereotypes that are uh frequently engaged with so in my opinion that pretty much
dispels the testimony of Flaviano we don't know what it originally said I don't think that even if
it was authentic we can reconstruct it and I'm not alone RT France EP Sanders and most recently
Margaret Williams all agree on this point as well and in addition to all of that the parallels
don't really work and those parallels that really that are the closest are with the Jewish war
as we know from the history of Tacitus's works just because you know one work doesn't mean you
know the other just because someone knows the Jewish war does not mean that they had access
to antiquities that yet remains to be proven um Tacitus's own work was much the same way as I
just described people only really knew his histories they did not know the annals was a thing right
for a long time so moving on from there there are other theories like uh different official sources
and this one's really popular among um apologists in particular you get people like Gary Habermas
and others who really want to argue you know he definitely had access to these archival materials
pilot probably sent in a report of some kind and Christians say there was a report
you know he had to be recalled to by Tiberias so maybe there was an investigation who knows there's
they're usually point to two principal sources the actus sanatus which was uh daily uh basically an
account of uh the deeds of the senate and then the uh commentary uh principus which was a uh
the official um imperial commentary um that Caesar had access to along with probably a few other very
very high up officials there are problems with all of these um Rian and ash um actually points out as
well as well as others that the actus sanatus actually increasingly becomes useless for Tacitus
as his work progresses um he cites it less he doesn't cite it very much to begin with um and by the
time we get to book 15 it just stops popping up really um so and in addition it's deeds of the senate
the chances of there being mention of some random Galilean preacher being executed
are just about non-existent this was this is what i wanted to ask you on that was this point and and
it's like do we even have any evidence of any of these sources that Habermas is hoping
you know he's hoping that he had access to something it wasn't copying someone else's
you know work or using other ideas to fill in for Jesus and Christian ideas or origins of
where these guys come from and who are they is there any evidence in any of these sources being
mentioned here that we know of that mentioned Christians that why would he why my point is
like why is he saying this is this one of those like well we don't have it so we can't prove there is
yeah no there's there's nothing there is no record of any of these official Roman sources
ever mentioning Christians and it would not be surprising if they didn't in fact it's probably
likely that they didn't um because there's just nothing to report uh who there are a bunch of
random people they're at best a group of you know 200 people in any given city who are just random
sectarians that no one cares about and at most at the very most they're just a public nuisance
that don't pay taxes that's it that's like that's that's all you have to go on um and it's very
evident that there wasn't a much official record on this at all because Pliny had no official record
and Pliny's writing not long before Tacitus is um at this point Pliny writes his letter
to the Emperor Trajan this is from book 10 of his epistle a it's epistle 96 of Oracle um
Pliny basically his writes and he's like hey I don't know what to do with these people I have not
sat on any trials I don't have any official records I don't have any legislation nothing he has nothing
to go on and asked uh uh uh asked Trajan like what do I do with these people uh well this is what
I've been doing trying to figure out more about them here's what my report on what I figured out
and mostly all he can come up with is they worship someone as a god Quasadillo they
are not paying their taxes and the temples are becoming destitute because too many people are
not actually going to temple anymore and this is very clearly what his main concern is is that
Christians are not upholding their end of the social bargain um it is expected of everyone in
the Roman Empire you pay your taxes and you do your dues to Caesar and if you don't you're a problem
that's what you do that's the law um so he's not really targeting Christians specifically
because they're Christian he's targeting them because they're breaking the law he would have
done this to anyone um and there are other religious groups that they also grabbed under
being um fault under false or improper associations and illegal associations as well like Druids
and the the and uh a few other subgroups uh there's but anyways he's he clearly doesn't know anything
if there were these official records available and Pliny was a very high up official you would
think that he would have access to them but you go to the at but what looking at the act of
senators again there's basically no reason to think that Jesus would appear in that at all
this was like a data uh this was basically recording just like the legislative actions
and a few other and other things like that that the senate took which had no bearing on Judea
Judea was beyond the auspices of the senate that was but run by the regional governors
so the idea that there is anything in there from Jesus just seems ludicrous to me and
I'm not the only one this is basically the opinion of uh Robert Van Borst and just about every other
commentator on this text the one that becomes more debated is the commentary principles
this is a you know the official record that uh was that looks like it was mostly the domain of
Caesar we get this impression because it's mentioned in Tacitus's text if I recall only once
and the context is there was a conspiracy and the senate wants access to figure out who the
rest of the co-conspirators were Domitian who is not emperor yet said basically says I don't think
that I have access to this so I have to wait till the emperor returns um and if I remember correctly
at the time this is Vespasian there's essentially he's saying that the the implication we get it's
not explicitly stated but it is heavily implied by this text they don't have regular access to this
text without imperial permission but even in like does this imperial and even yeah and even then
why would it mention Jesus right is this do you feel like to mention the random execution of some
nobody in Judea it like what is this is this cataloging every last single random person the
Roman Empire executed on a daily basis I mean they're executing probably people by the hundreds
every week right they are not recording some random prophet in Judea I mean the case the case
and point of this is that if they actually were recording details of these people leading uprisings
or these random prophets you'd think they would have remembered the Egyptians name right he was
far more he had a far more impressive following than Jesus did and with far more lofty goals
that required a military intervention and they can't even recall his name you think they remember
Jesus no there's no reason to think that Jesus would have ever been mentioned in any of these
official texts at all this is also coming to another problem which is that Tacitus cites
no source here there is nothing cited for any of these claims why probably because he didn't see
any need to cite a source but that means that we just have no idea where he's getting this
in explicitly when you look at his writing techniques Tacitus very rarely cite sources
the idea that he carefully cites sources that he's this very careful historian doing all the
special archival research is nonsense as Margaret Williams notes are doing archival research is not
what ancient historians did they rarely ever did so Suetonius is actually the exception
he is Suetonius has actually been going through a bit of a revival in terms of his work lately as
Margaret Williams discusses but he does some archival work Tacitus no he's not going into
Roman archives and stuff he's mostly reliant on a other literary sources and be hearsay and he's
reliant on a lot of hearsay his work Germania is virtually all hearsay and occasionally first
hand accounts from Romans who went there but let's be real probably not reliable on what the
what the German and Gaelic tribes were like yeah like that's not gonna have some propagandistic
yeah just like his views of Christians I mean you know you're gonna get but that is probably
the perception that they had which is something that is important as you're when you start to
connect this to to where you're thinking it's his ideas yeah he's just not he's not he's not
this special careful historian that everyone just likes pretending that he is David Potter and others
have all discussed this at some length like for example A.J. Woodman and R.H. Martin they wrote
Tacitus is no exception to the general rule that ancient historians refer to their sources
only with relative infrequency when they do so it is often a means of corroborating matters
which might provoke surprise skepticism or controversy with their readers in short
Tacitus doesn't cite sources because unless there is a reason unless he's saying something he needs
to really convince you of which usually he doesn't he's not going to that's just not how
ancient Roman historians worked and when he does cite sources it's very often vague again
to quote Woodman and Martin again references to nameless octores are particularly effective
in circumstances in in such circumstances to corroborate a writer's potentially challenged
claims because they enhance the writer's authority but cannot be checked and that's the thing even
when he said when he cites things like the act of senators what specifically is he citing
what addition what publication is that implied no one does that mean that tacitus is bringing
when when he doesn't source it and he just quotes it or he just mentions it but doesn't
say where he gets it from is that an act in the litter in the writer's perspective of authority
themselves like you don't need me to give you the source where I got this from you could just trust
me and that's what the point yes what was yes it is it is it is in granting authority to yourself
because you're saying I know this material you can trust my material you don't have and
in some respects even include including a lot of citations in your work was considered kind of bad
form it doesn't look nice it's not aesthetically because you also have to remember that these works
are organized and written with thematic cores and goals in mind and they're also written to be
recited we know this uh Pliny recounts reciting his official works this is essentially what
publishing was in that day you wrote your work you polished it up you got some feedback from
maybe a trusted source we'll get to that and then you presented it to your to this a core
audience of people and had it read and had it read and presented made depending on length
probably over the course of a few days and such and then after that that's published there it is
it goes into a library that is that that is essentially what we're working with here and
so you're not going to like citing a whole bunch of sources and stuff it interrupts the flow of
the work you are working predominantly in an oral culture and on top of that it doesn't make
help the thematic flow at all it interrupts things with oh he says so and so so and so says x
and this person says why etc etc etc and also when you want to say when you want to try and
validate a particular skeptical claim the being vaguer is better right saying the authors
famous historians and authors support me on this but not saying which ones is much more effective
than set then specifically citing some guy and then he turns out not to say what you claim he said
so okay we have really started sifting into this task of this thing the real question then
is he's got this christian material where did he get it Chrissy I mean did he just did Jesus hand
him a letter did it UFO fly down from heaven and give it to the guy I mean what did he and you
mentioned this to you like did he investigate Christians while he was rolling over here you
know we don't know that but like is there what is the most plausible based on your research
explanation for how he has this in his writings so my argument is specifically that I think he's
getting it from Pliny the younger Pliny the younger is the only of previous Roman source
we know that ever mentions Christians and he mentions them in a way that gives the implication
that Romans didn't know who these people were he knows of no prior trials or or
or any persecutions or anything like that he's functioning completely in the blind
he has to figure out and and explain who they're even worshiping because not even that much was
no now there is one other suggestion I won't get into it but it's I discount it kind of out of hand
John Granger Cook argues maybe Tacitus and Suetonius are relying on up a law on lost
literary sources and there's no evidence of that the only real evidence we have is Pliny and this
comes from a number of different arenas so the first and the most significant is that we have
tons of letters that Pliny wrote you read through books one through nine and he mentions or writes
two Tacitus numerous times he solicits and we also have Tacitus soliciting him for information
at one point Tacitus wants information about the death of Pliny's uncle Pliny the elder who died
on a ship when Mount Vesuvius erupted he was right in the area and he was trying to survey the
eruption so Tacitus want information on that we know Tacitus solicited information we know that
he also sent his work to be edited and checked by Pliny specifically because we know that Pliny
specifically says that he's sending Tacitus's historical work back to him with notes
we also know that Pliny and Tacitus were fairly close and on top of this we also know that Pliny
and Suetonius were fairly close Suetonius was probably his secretary when he was governor in
Pontus and Bithynia i.e. when he was put in Christians on trial
this gives us a lot of good reason just it might be circumstantial but just from these
from from that alone we already have pretty good reason to think this but not only this we know
that Tacitus used other letters and also other works of Pliny's this has been argued and pretty
much a consensus for quite a long time as Margaret Williams notes that we know that he was using some
of his orations and rhetorical works and then in the Cambridge companion to Tacitus if I remember
correctly there's even someone who makes a very substantial argument that he was aware of other
letters of Pliny's and uses them in other spots now some have a word about this if I remember
correctly JP Holding argues that he's taking it that at some places he's taking a jab at Pliny
if younger but they're wrong it's actually Pliny the elder he's jabbing at so that alone is already
some pretty decent reason so we have we have a body of the killer using using a detective analogy
who shoots a gun a certain way they've gone out hunting together they're trained with the weapon
you know they've oftentimes they had a lot in common when it comes to these things and then
you come to find out in the passage back to Tacitus the perception of Christians seems to be
very similar to what we're seeing over here in Pliny and what we see with with Tacitus and that
descriptions of what Christians were what they believed who these people were that kind of stuff
there's overlap so you even have the the murder being somewhat similar over here going back to this
whole analogy thing yeah can you tell us about that yeah so essentially they yeah well as you said
they have very similar attitudes towards Christians very similar agendas here as well I think when
it comes to this the most concrete piece that really fits these two together is identical language
the they not only do they shoot the gun the same way not only do they have similar weight
not only do they fit like a glove because of their close connections we have means we have motive
and we have opportunity they have similar grammatical overlap they bought their bullets
from the same store and the shells are found at the at the crime scene yeah they both describe
they both explicitly describe they're the um Christians as a superstitious superstitio
uh Tacitus right this is superstitio um rossum and then we have uh Pliny it's a where he has a
um a problem so they both call it a contagion or a disease on society they both despise it
this is where thing and this is where things also get interesting as you know Pliny describes Jesus
as claus ideo which means they worship um Jesus as if he's a god you compare that with Tacitus
they worship this man Jesus or this man christus both of them only know Jesus by the title christus
as well all of it just really perfectly lines up although you have you have verbatim overlaps
you have uh you have me you have um Tacitus and Pliny being close friends exchanging work with
each other Pliny explicitly editing Tacitus's work offering feedback Tacitus solicits information
from Pliny on occasion this is stronger evidence than any other speculative uh and conjectured
origin point none other has this has this many correlations for where Tacitus got his information
so the question is where does the neuronium persecution reference come from in there that's
the question because Pliny doesn't mention that we need to get into that in our next episode
Chrissy Hansen ladies and gentlemen show her some love in the comment section down below
go read the article i'm going to put both of them in the description if you're okay with that Chrissy
that way if they watch either the video they can access both of those links um this is amazing i
you've got me pretty persuaded i mean i i don't know the languages and things but
it just based on my reading of this this is uh i'm not denying that they couldn't have known
something of Josephus or whatever but like as you point out in the article it's honestly irrelevant
um to the case you're making and i could see why someone who might try to go to Josephus to
say it was a negative testimony and maybe there was something in common but uh it's super speculative
at this point it's a hypothesis that doesn't have you know the the experts the number one
experts on this Josephus issue cannot agree uh in many ways so i'm going to go with what you're
describing as making the most sense and i hope that people let us know what you think in the
comments uh show some love any final words from you and this episode before we get to Nero
uh no all all i can say is um thanks for watching um you can find me i have a humanities
comments page i have a public email so if you want information or you want to ask any questions
or anything hit me up um aside from that i'll see you next time all the links are in the description
go show her some love and never forget we are myth vision
