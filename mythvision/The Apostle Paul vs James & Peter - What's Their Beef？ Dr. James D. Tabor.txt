anything you'd like
professor james d tabour what can i call you can i call you james or dr tabour is that okay
i'm gonna let you call me james james since we're gonna talk about a very important james
whose name was really yakov but right we'll get to that i'm interested in this i just want you to
know um i might accidentally say dr tabour or something it automatically just because that's
what i'm used to dr tabour is fine either way whatever you what did you do with the lane
uh dr pagels uh and it you know it's actually formal though right um my student my students
don't call me by my first name but this is uh i'm okay i'd like to be a student today because
honestly there's a lot of learning that i i have done and i know we will do today then you would
go with dr tabour yes i'm okay with you i have no problem with that whatsoever some professors
do the first name thing i don't think it's a good practice like my teacher my phd teacher
he's dead now jonathan smith probably the greatest historian of religions of our generation i couldn't
call him jonathan for 30 years finally at the very end as he was getting really old i did
but i always called him mr smith they don't use doctorate chicago because everybody is a doctor
redone well dr tabour first question i have i read your book everyone needs to go get it
paul and jesus it's truly epic on looking into what this crazy mysterious guy called paul was
up to i mean he was a pioneer in many ways but there's good you can say good things you can
say bad things you can do whatever paul's one of those guys and this is my first question paul
against the other apostles let's get right to the heart of the problem right it seems to me and i
had this discussion with your student uh ron katala yeah and i was like i feel like paul's
definitely taking jabs at peter and james and he's like i don't know about that and you know axe
harmonizes and then second peter tries to play that peter's cool with paul and anyway he seems to be
extremely sarcastic about the other apostles do you think relations is clearly talking about
peter and james in a negative light whether he is personally antagonistic towards them or not
like when he visited them that he dread going and hate seeing them or anything of that sort
i don't think so but where he's adamant and you have to look at the context of galatians
is where did he get his gospel that's absolutely key to understanding paul paul never met jesus
he tells you oh i met james once by the time he writes the letters the that letter galatians
what 50s 49 50 let's just say 50 year 50 cead so he has met james he said i stayed with peter for
two weeks so he probably got to know him pretty well uh you know just staying with somebody and
talking all the time i'm sure he wanted to hear a lot so i want to think that they were friendly
and paul was probably very curious but in terms of the message look what he says in the very first
chapter and remember the context is he's worried that some are drifting away from what he calls
my gospel he uses that term i explained that in the book it's a very definite term my gospel
why do you say our gospel or the gospel sometimes he says the gospel but my gospel and he says i did
not learn it from anybody i didn't receive it from anybody i got it as a revelation of
or from jesus christ i say over from because the genitive there can either be
you know through the agency of jesus or directly from jesus i even like from because you get the
idea he says later in and other letters i receive this from the lord so i'm gonna go from
so he got it from jesus so is it a revelation about jesus yes of course but it's a revelation
about jesus from jesus meaning jesus revealed himself to paul so that's important to him and he
the whole point of that chapter is to establish his independence if if readers haven't you know
your your viewers readers whatever if they haven't read it lately you should read chapter one and
two of galatians two of the most important and revealing chapters in the new testament i think
they're unquestionably authentic they're kind of the key to the whole historical jesus debate
because you've got a guy in the fifties who's testifying kind of in the first person about his
experiences of you know receiving the revelation from jesus and he calls it a revelation of jesus
christ so that's that's big now but the tone all the way through is yes i did go up to jerusalem
to those who are in christ before me and he said i went up by revelation what does that mean
he was out there's a conference we call it the first jerusalem conference it's recorded in the
book of acts x 15 there it's very very kumbaya very friendly everybody hugs and kisses and
no disagreement paul does say they reached an agreement unfortunately we don't have
the minutes of that meeting we've got luke's account many many decades later and i think
you know we get glimpses in paul's letter of what went on but what's really interesting is the
language that he is he said i went up by revelation what does that mean that means jesus said you can
go you know you're my guy you can go and i took titus with me as my show and tell i call it
now i don't know they're not going to drop his pants and show he's yeah uncircumcised but the
idea is here is a gentile he couldn't do timothy because remember timothy was jewish but he's got
a gentile titus who is clean morally spiritually sexually he believes in the one god he doesn't
worship idol he he's like this is what my gospel is producing come with me titus you're my helper
you're my friend i'm sure he loved him very much so he said i took titus i went up by revelation
and then he said and we met and we talked and then two times he says and to the those who were
reputed to be pillars notice the language the greek is interesting but you can also translate it
i think the rsv or one of them does this i like it and the so-called pillars of the church i love
that the so-called pillars what they are means nothing to me now he doesn't mean they don't mean
anything to me like i trash them i hate them that's not what he's saying he's saying in terms of two
issues two issues here is titus okay that's what the issue is is my guy okay in the eyes of the
authorities at drissom that would be james and all the other apostles now including matthias who
replaced judas so that's and the rest of the drissom church which is the headquarters church
this is the vatican you know this is going to the headquarters in that day and you're getting the
approval of quote the pope the papa the the head of everything jesus brother james will talk a lot
about that so anyway what does he say he says uh i went up the two issues are is he okay and here's
what i'm preaching are you guys okay with this because i want to know am i running in vain he
loves he loves the runner images he uses them quite often he's he's he's a hella mystic jew he grew
up in the diaspora he's probably seen you know sports are big like it would be a baseball image
he does it in philippines when he talks about the reed getting that yeah winners yeah it'd be like
if you said to me something to me about baseball or football or basketball in america you know he'd be
like hey paul you know you so he says i i could be running in vain in this race you know so that's
why he's going he wants to know and i laid before them my gospel he says i laid it before them but
notice he's saying but what if they had disagreed guess what i'm going to listen to jesus guys
and i know you were with them a long time ago but you know you need to get updated
because i'm i heard from jesus and he gives the chronology you know 14 years ago and then three
years ago and we don't know if it's 14 plus three 17 or does he mean 14 uh three and then 14 all
together but either way it gets you right around 50 you know 49 50 right in there but then two times
he says you know not only what what they are means nothing to me but like they added nothing
you know now that can mean that they agreed and and it's possible that they did agree i think they
did x 15 is i would say accurate in this sense that uh james said no the gent the non-jews i like
to say non-jews gentiles kind of the old it's actually a latin word that means nation so right
and you know that israel's called gentile when abraham's going to become a great nation
going to become a great gentile so gentiles are not a good word the non-jews the non-israelites
i think the decision was generally agreed it's rabbinic really that non-jews have a place in
the world to come if they follow the basic what are called the noachite laws the basic laws that
are applicable to all humanity but jews are under a special covenant the synai covenant the
hoarev covenant and they obviously are obligated to follow the whole Torah now whether james added
also an oral Torah like the Pharisees and the sages these had done with all their interpretations
you got to interpret something like how do you keep the Sabbath you know what is this what is that
uh but paul paul the the laws that they generally list in the book of acts are like things like
sexual morality it's called it's translated fornication but it just means you got to live a
sexually moral life you can't eat blood which is a little odd but that's associated with idolatry
because the meat in an ancient city like Corinth the the makel on the meat market
that meat has all been dedicated to Athena so a lot of jews would i'm not gonna buy that meat that
was dedicated to a pagan god i'm gonna have my own kosher and my own way of getting meat and so
forth so that but basically it's it's just like clear ethics that would apply to all decent people
you know the rabbis would say like don't murder don't lie don't cheat don't steal live a sexually
moral life and turn from idols to the one god so here's Titus he's doing all that he's cleaned up
or maybe he was never that you know pagan i don't know but the point is he's a good example
and paul says this is okay but what if they had said and this gets to your question um
no paul actually they should start moving toward the Torah hey six months a year we'd like to see
him convert to Judaism take on the whole Torah he would have walked out of the meeting there's no
question now they probably didn't say that but there are there are pockets and groups within the
jesus movement that are thinking that would be the way like if god is given all of these
commandments for our good dietary laws and all sorts the festivals they're beautiful festivals
that Judaism treasures today don't you want these Gentiles that have been worshiping isis and
Athena and you know Zeus and so forth they need a culture they they should kind of move toward you
know Jewish culture and finally maybe the males can become circumcised we can make for them you
know dip them they can become Jews now if they had said that i think paul so i'm trusting paul
i think he's are i'm i'm saying that ax is probably accurate on the main parameters because paul
said we agreed and certainly paul is agreeing right now here's the stickler here's the stickler
and it's tough and i take a position in the book okay is ax 15 ax 15 is giving you the ideal
Jews stay Jews and they believe in Jesus Christ and they're sanctified by the holy spirit and
forgiven of their sins Gentiles keep the basic let's just call it the basic morality for all
human beings from the time of Noah you know before Sinai obviously you can't lie cheats
still back then either you know god is a god of justice and righteousness throughout history so
uh uh the question then is if a Jew really that paul works with because he converted Jews too
and the Jew begins to talk to fall maybe privately and says you know
this Torah thing that the rabbis are teaching at the synagogue do we need to follow all of
those interpretations paul and i'm picturing paul saying well you know a lot of the interpretations
the traditions i've been told by james and peter what we call halakha uh how to walk in the Torah
oral tradition the rabbis call it today the Pharisees had it developed a lot of that
you know that's maybe some of that is good but it really gets down in a lot of minutia like if i'm
a tailor the mishnah discusses can i carry a pen a needle in my lapel because it's carrying a burden
and that is the tool of my work a needle is the tool of my work say well what's a needle it's light
that isn't how it works are you carrying the tool of your work well then the plumber can carry his
tools and the doctor can carry his tools and the construction worker you see the idea and i kind of
picture paul uh being and maybe jay i think james and peter as well being pretty we back then it
would be considered the word liberal and conservative is misused even today but to have a freer more
open interpretation of how to keep the commands like i'm going to keep the Sabbath for example
but how do i keep the Sabbath and i don't know this because paul never comments on it but he does
say once in colossians which is probably a secondary polling letter but he says things like
in engolations engolations too i can quote that in colossians spring says you observe days seasons
months years touch not taste not handle not that's not what it's about so some of his people are
getting pulled toward more of that you know fully observant maybe in following the Pharisee
interpretation maybe the sagacian interpretation maybe the comron interpretation which is the
dead sea scroll more sagacian but even more strict than the Pharisees i want your listeners to know
that the Pharisees are the liberals everybody thinks they're conservative they're actually the
liberals because they try to figure out how to make ways for people to practically live according
to Torah for example the Torah says you can't go out of your house on the Sabbath and it says to
put the toilets outside the house whoa what are we going to do there no problem with the Pharisees
they mark what's called an eruv around the area they still that do it today in Jerusalem
and you can have a toilet you know way out or whatever you don't have house is defined now my
house is like my town that's my house whereas at comron they apparently Josephus says go
no you gotta hold it 24 hours you stay in the camp toilets are outside the camp and Josephus says
and i admire them so for their great piety and uh you know i did work at comron and found the
latrines i published this wow in the revue de comron the journal people can look it up it
it's also on my website all my articles uh jamestaber.com if you look anyway Josephus and
i found the latrines in their 200 cubits northwest of the camp that they were actually using and as
joe said can you imagine it sundown when the bell rung so to speak people are lining up
so anyway so i mentioned all that just to say that yeah an example of some of the and i'm not
making fun of Judaism for orthodoxy and strict right i've been in orthodox homes for the Sabbath
it's a pleasure it's a delight believe me some way like you're not answering the phone you're not
doing this and that it's also a good thing you know you don't have to worry about anything you just
for 24 hours have talk and eat and drink wine and associate you know right yeah but go ahead yeah
no what i guess getting to the heart of the problem paul peter and james um i've heard people say even
i think dr pagels thinks that um you know there's definitely a problem between the groups because
soon after that paul is now confronting peter it's it this isn't you know they're not just best
pals and buds in this whole thing now oh i confront her to him's face to his face what's paul trying
to say to his galatian audience because he's trying to tell them something and then he's
constantly defending himself from this day forward it seems i am not a liar i did not lie
what's the accusation there's so many problems that paul's trying to address and it makes me
think that they fractioned at first we were cool they even approved of it yeah why are you saying
that about they approved of it i think well it's probably i'll come back to peter but but there's
a wider peter was a table fellowship thing and we we know what that was about right i'll get back to
that but there's a wider issue and it's it's absolutely the major issue and it's actually
known in x in x 21 years later when paul goes finally to drusselm again and he's coming up
with gifts he ends up getting arrested and so forth and it's the end of the story but before
that happens what does he do when he soon as he arrives and he's brought gifts from the gentiles
this is fulfilling the profits for him right we'll talk about that later he thinks these are
the prophesied that the the non-jews will bring gifts up to drusselm in the last days so you know
it's it's almost like symbolic i don't know how much he brought but maybe you know maybe he had
several thousand people donating and then he goes we brought this for the jewish people to help the
poor and so forth so he goes in to see james and james says oh paul i'm paraphrasing he says uh
so great to see you uh there's is something though before we go further we need to clarify
some people are saying that you are going beyond our agreement the galatians agreement
like we agreed that gentiles don't have to keep the Torah halakically like like jews we agreed on
that so we're there and uh so that's not the issue but there are rumors that you're telling some jews
maybe you yourself that even jews really don't need to keep the Torah in the full strict way
of an observant jew because we're so near the end of time that the what what he says in uh
Corinthians the form of this world is passing away meaning we're moving into a time when there's
neither jew nor greek and even says that in Galatians there's neither slave or free there's
neither male or female because he thinks there's going to be this cosmic transformation now james
doesn't say all that but he's but notice in acts he doesn't let paul answer which is not a witness
to what actually happened it's a witness to the author of acts writing chapter 21 wanting you to
know that paul still tore observant whether he is or not and he's taking the sight of james right
the side that jews need to keep the Torah that's consistent all the way through the book of acts
but he does paul didn't answer so what he says oh he's laughing when i hear he says
so that they will know these rumor so that everyone will know that these rumors aren't true
like he just said be like i said to you derrick i heard you were doing this this this but i know
you're not in order to show that you're not could we do you go well wait uh actually are you sure
let's have a little discussion of this now thank god we have first Corinthians nine
this is earlier where he's writing later than galatians but earlier than the meeting
at the toward the end in the fifties and he says you know here's my strategy to the jew i become
as a jew wait a minute you become as a jew well what does that mean
and to those under the law become as one under the law what do you mean as one under the law
jews are under the law you know under and by the way it doesn't mean under the burden or
oppression of the law it means it's the bar mitzvah you take on the yoke of the law but jesus
said my yoke is easy my burden is light meaning my interpretations of the Torah have to do with
what god really wants like how do you keep the Sabbath it's supposed to be a blessing it's made
for humans not humans for the Sabbath and so forth so don't take it as under the law meaning like oh
i'm under this law it's so horrible because that's the later Protestant view and it's still the view
of Judaism today by many Christians all those poor jews they have to do all this stuff if they only
knew christ non-issue that is not the issue Paul makes that clear but he says and then he says
not under the Torah to god or christ you know meaning he says as if i'm under the Torah although
i'm really not in terms of christ because i'm under the Torah of christ and then he goes into the
Gentiles i become as a gentile well what does that mean what do you mean as a Gentile
i think he would it's usually things like table fellowship like i'm invited over
and you have a meal i don't start inquiring um where where did you uh i see you have some
you know what chicken there or something where where where did our lamb let's go with lamb
where was that did you did you purchase that at the local isis temple this morning you know
yeah so they become you don't and he says in romans 14 eat what is put before you don't ask
questions you know don't you know just the earth is the lords the fullness thereof this is all in
Corinthians now clearly james and peter peter we don't know enough about peter but james and what
he represents Torah observant messianic judo so much jesus as the messiah raced from the dead
returning again uh he would not agree with that you know i think ax is reflecting probably where
james would be on that issue so jews need to jews are to observe the Torah in an enlightened way
according to the teachings of jesus that we have some inkling of but jen tells uh don't they're not
of obligated to keep all those things it mainly has to do with dietary laws circumcision festivals
the Sabbath hola fredersen's kind of she's hit the nail in the head and in a lot of ways yeah um
so so i think did he break with them or is he against them my sense is that he believes things
that if they knew he believed them there would be an absolute break the question is did that time
ever come now and i'll finish the question with this because i know you have other related things
but you have four minutes left two times out so in my book pollin jesus and i i struggle with this
more than anything called battle of the apostles and i cover all this but i finally say did they
keep this uneasy kind of coexistence where paul doesn't really let on what he's really saying
and doing because he's out in the hinterland and then when he goes up to james he's like oh yeah we
agreed yeah jews need to keep the Torah here give me some of your kosher meat that's really good
you know did he kind of play along because he says i'd be yeah i act like a jew i'm
under the law although i'm really not under law he says he's under law of christ whatever that means
and we can talk about that on his ethics so anyway here's the question did he get exposed at some
point by people visiting Corinth primarily because in second Corinthians which is not a single letter
it's probably as many as four letters it's all fragmented but i did my phd dissertation on 10
through 12 that's actually 10 through 13 include 13 and i focused particularly on paul's
ascent to paradise but the question is he starts talking about p are they hebrus so am i are they
israelite so am i are they apostles so am i i'm a better one and so forth and people go well he's
not talking about the Jerusalem people no way that's you know that's it's other apostles and
jews and later that's the standard opinion i'm sure 99 percent of my colleagues hold that view
but i went back to fc bower this is 1800s fc bower taught a lot of the great
uh a lot of the greats uh of of the enlightenment in the german you know movement of new testament
studies this is ferdinand christian bower and he argued that there was an absolute split in
dichotomy a lot of people will say things like can you believe that taber went back to bower he's
been totally discredited this is ba ur not er because there's a er that's known for his new
testament dictionary um walter bower so fc bower and uh i just say to that yeah i did go back to
bower and i got convinced he was right i think paul broke with the apostles and i'm sure it was on
this issue and yet i don't think he was really against the Torah he just thought it was passing
away i don't think he wrote hebrus but there's a line in hebrus that i think he would sign on to
the opening what is obsolete is passing is is presently passing away the form of this cosmos
is passing away and he says the time will come that those who have wives will be as those have none
and so forth he believes the parisia the coming of jesus and the transformation is so near that this
touch not taste not handle not and there's a sense in which uh this would resonate i think with
many two people i mean on some levels it certainly resonates with me i want to be i want to be the
objective scholar that's trying to descriptively figure out what happened and not take a side like
well that was really good what he said about obviously the parisia didn't come but you know
his idea was all of that will be completely moot very soon we won't even be talking about it
and i want to explore that further some of the ramifications of that
but that's a big one i definitely want to as well thank you so much
