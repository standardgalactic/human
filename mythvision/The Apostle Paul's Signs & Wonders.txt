In our last episode, we looked at Paul and we said, would Paul have cared if some of his members
needed healing, that they would go to the God, Asclepius temple or other places to try and find
healing? Did Paul even do healings? And we asked this question and we delved a little bit into it.
But in this one, we're going to dive into pericope, actually get into the text and show where Paul's
using these terms of signs and wonders and these deeds that are happening because of the gospel
in his congregations. However, the book of Acts has a strange painted picture for Paul,
where he's an exorcist and he's literally healing people. It's even a handkerchief that
is being passed around from town to town and it's healing people of their illnesses.
At the end of the day, is any of this actually true? Did Paul himself actually perform these deeds?
Or is it possible we're dealing with a later idea attached to Paul, maybe even Jesus?
We are MythVision. Welcome back to MythVision podcast. I'm the host, Derek Lambert. Today,
we're going to be delving deeper into Paul. I have my wonderful friend, Dr. Christopher D. Stanley.
I'll be calling him Chris Fingers Cross as I get used to this. Last episode that we did,
we dove into Paul and Paul, how would Paul have answered this issue of someone needing to go to
a healing, like a miracle worker or a doctor or a sage or whatever you might call them that are
trying to help people cure an illness that they might be dealing with. We landed on the issue
saying, well, Paul is an apocalyptic guy who's probably not too concerned with this life and
getting ready for the heavenly Jerusalem, getting ready for this being seated in heavenly places
kind of idea. We see in the pseudopographical writing of Ephesians, it seems. He's ready to go
to another place and he's not so concerned about the now, but if they needed to go,
he probably wouldn't have and we're just speculating here. Probably wouldn't have been too
concerned as long as they understood. You're not worshiping these, no idols are real, our
God is true. However, there are some texts that we need to get into today, I think,
where you're going to be making a case on Paul and miracle working, signs and wonders,
all of these interesting things. So I'm going to pass it off to you, Chris. If you don't mind,
tell us a little bit of background on this and then let's get into this subject.
Yeah, thanks, Derek. For anybody who hasn't listened to the first one, I'll remind them that
if you did and forgotten that the things we're talking about here are flowing out of a
book, an academic book that I've just submitted to the publisher will be coming out later this
year from Bloomsbury TNT Clark titled Paul and the Skelepias, the Greco-Roman quest for healing
and the mission to Paul. And I also mentioned that and Derek will bring up a screen on this in a
minute that a lot of these same things about sickness and healing and miracles and gods and
things like this are very much on display in two historical novels that I've written
that are called a rooster for a Skelepias and a bull for Pluto. And then there's a third volume,
the trilogy not yet written. And so we'll direct to that website later if you want an accessible
in-road to the kinds of things we're talking about here either instead of or while you're waiting for
the more academic treatment of these things. And you can go to Amazon as well if you're interested
in getting it, but his website will be a good place so you're at least aware in keeping track or
follow him on Amazon. That way when the latest and the greatest does come out, you're getting the email
and it's notifying you, letting you know that that book is out there. So just letting everybody
know that's a way that you can go and get acquainted with his work. Thank you, Derek. And yeah, the
website for this web fiction series is aslavesstory.com without any apostrophes or anything like that.
So moving on to the issues today, we were, as Derek rightly said, last time we were talking more about
the kinds of healers that Paul or his congregation might have used and what Paul thought of that.
And I intentionally left to the side some texts in Paul where he certainly appears to be talking
about miraculous things accompanying his preaching and questions have been raised about whether
healings, particularly a lot of people suggested that healings and exorcisms might be those things
though I think ultimately I think we can't know. I will have real doubts about exorcisms because
Paul never mentioned such things in his letters. The Book of Acts talks about Paul as a healer
and so and as a miracle worker. So we're going to get into that some today also and how do we relate
Paul's letters to the Book of Acts and eventually we're going to come around to, we're going to
broaden this to the broader questions of miracles in the ancient world and the very different worldview
that prevailed in those times. And we're going to eventually circle back around Paul and even to our
own world and what do we make of all these kinds of things not only in the New Testament but in the
broader Grecoroman world as compared with our own and things like that. So that's kind of where we're
going I think today and I think it's going to be a lot of fun and interesting material that most
people even in academic circles don't think about too much but particularly say in ordinary you know
Americans or even in Christian circles really don't know or think much about unless perhaps
somewhat in kind of charismatic Pentecostal circles where these texts are seen as more normative
as the way Christians ought to be today and that kind of thing. So I think what we'll do first is
we'll start by looking at a number of texts in Paul's letters to give us a textual background
for what we're talking about here and Derek just got some slides here of these and I just want to
take a moment to read through these with you give you time to look at them because they're texts that
probably most Christians and certainly people outside the church have never really noticed
or paid attention to unless as I say you're in a kind of charismatic Pentecostal church setting.
So first there are three texts in Paul's letters where he talks about what he calls signs and wonders
or something along the related to that that he says or accompanied his preaching and I won't
quite say prove the truth of his message but somehow validated it to show that what he was
saying shows he really wants someone who had a connection to God and therefore his message must
be true. So first in Romans 15 verses 18 to 19 he is near the end of his letters these Christians
in Rome he's saying, for I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished
through me to an obedience from the Gentiles and then by word and deed by the power of signs and
wonders by the power of the Spirit of God so that from Jerusalem and as far around as the
lyric on my fully proclaim the good news of Christ notice his words he's what he's done is he's
proclaimed by word and deed and deed he clarifies he means by the power of signs and wonders by the
power of the Spirit of God this phrase signs and wonders comes up a few times in Paul's letters
it's a phrase that's used a number of times in the Hebrew Bible while Paul used it in a Greek
version called the Septuagint we might say the Jewish scriptures or Christians would say the
Old Testament particularly around the episode of the Exodus story where Moses is leading the
people of Israel out of Egypt and the great miracles that God does at that time are often
called signs and wonders let's go on to the next one in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verses 11 to 12
Paul has been just before this talking about all the things that he has endured the great
sufferings and abuse as a follower of Jesus and a missionary to the Gentiles and we talked about
this last time we actually went over some of the text right before this but he goes on to talk about
how God had given him what he calls a thorn in the flesh he never explains what this was and how
he prayed to God three times for it to be removed and God said to him um you're basically you got
to live with it you know you'll find my strength and your weakness right after that he's been this
boasting about his suffering so he says uh in verse 11 I've been a fool you've forced me to it
indeed you should have been the ones commending me that is instead of commending himself
over against who he calls these super apostles I'm not at all inferior to these super apostles
even though I am nothing and then as proof of his being an apostle he says the signs of a true
apostle were performed among you with utmost patience signs and wonders and mighty works
and he's expecting the Corinthians know what he's talking about he doesn't tell us what he's talking
about but he can just use this language to refer to things that have happened among the
Corinthians that he assumes they will remember and interestingly on that first text I read he's
writing to Christians in Rome the first man where he's never even visited and yet he assumes they
understand what he means by having preached and been accompanied by the power of signs and wonders
apparently Paul has some kind of a reputation as a wonder worker of some type or the other such
that he didn't even allude to it without explaining it to Christians he's never been to a third text
in Paul's letters where he refers to this in a in a way that is kind of odd because it's not about
him but it's still relevant to this question and second second Thessalonians chapter two and there
are some debates among scholars about whether Paul wrote second Thessalonians or not but I'll just
we can look at the text regardless he's talking about the coming of someone who he calls the
lawless one who will come just before the end of all things and mislead people away from God in his
truth and he says and then the lawless one will we reveal whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the
breath of his mouth annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming the coming of the
lawless one as a parent in the working of Satan who uses who uses all power signs lying wonders
and every kind of wicked deception deception for those who are perishing because they refuse to
love the truth and so be saved not just Paul but even an evil being can do signs and wonders
so interesting what to make of that but what what holds this together with the others is that
the signs of wonders the miracles are again seen as validating the authority of the speaker
and the truth of the message in this case of course from Paul's standpoint this person is
leading people into a false message but in terms of its effectiveness it's persuading people that
yes this person is speaking the truth let's go on then to a few passages five of them where Paul
uses the word power in his letters in such a way that he seems pretty clearly to be talking
about similar kind of phenomena that he was describing in the verses we just looked at
and one that let's skip over the first one in Romans one and come back to it if we can there
can you get the second one because I want to offer a reading of the Romans one that's different
than what people normally do so in 1 Corinthians 2 verses 1 to 5 he says when I came to you brothers
and sisters talking to the Christians in the city Corinth and Greece I did not proclaim the come
proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words of wisdom for I decided to know nothing
among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified and I came to you in weakness and in fear and in
much trembling my speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom but with
a demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your face might rest not on human wisdom
but on the power of God Paul in 1 Corinthians 1 was at length going on and on about how the
message that he preaches is foolishness of both Jews and Greeks the idea of a Messiah who has
been crucified is ridiculous to Jews and to Greeks the idea of that a man who was crucified
by the Romans as a criminal would somehow be someone that should be worshiped to honor this God
is equally ridiculous and Paul is aware of this he's saying okay my message is pretty weird to
these people he also says I'm not a very good speaker he repeatedly insists that it's not
his persuasiveness his oratorical skills that one these Corinthians and and others too to the
message that he's preaching what does he say it was he says it was a demonstration of the spirit
and of power well again he doesn't explain what he means but clearly he expects the Corinthians
to remember and know some kinds of works of power I think we would have to use the word supernatural
or miraculous even though we want to those two terms aren't really as relevant for the ancient
world we'll talk about that in a minute so that their faith might not rest on human wisdom in
other words on the fact that I just persuaded you that I've got some good ideas but on the power of
God so acts of power are meant to be the kind of ultimate proof of the validity of what he's preaching
let's go to the next one first Corinthians 420 just a very brief reference he's talking about
when he's going to come to the Corinthians and discipline them if they don't shape up
and he makes this kind of broad general statement that's somewhat in line with what we're just
reading they're a bit different he says for the kingdom of God depends not on talk but on power
again he says hey you know the fact that these people can talk and say nice things
doesn't mean anything if they don't have the power that goes along with it again it seems to be
suggesting to Paul that for Paul some kind of a tapping into God's power is a vital evidence of
one's who one is and the proof of one's message let's go to the next one next to last one before
Romans 1 so second Corinthians chapter 6 verses 4 to 7 Paul is listing all kinds of qualifications he
has but he does it kind of ironically all the sufferings he's endured and such as that and the
ways in which he has commended himself as servants we have commended ourselves in every way and what
he means is these are the ways that we the editorial we himself and his followers his associates
probably have shown ourselves to be devoted followers of Christ and to be the apostles
who you should listen to and he talks about the thing all this long list of things they've endured
in verses four and five and it comes down in verse six some of his positive qualities that
demonstrate his qualifications he says by purity ways he's committed yourself by purity knowledge
patience kindness holiness of spirit genuine love notice verse 7 truthful speech that is again
back to the idea the message he proclaims and the power of God so again this idea that speak
his his sufferings the quality of his character the truth of his message and the power of God
he says those are the ways he got four criteria there you can use for seeing that I am indeed
speaking for God and therefore you should follow what I say and then the last one before we go back
to Romans one he says in 1 Thessalonians 1 dealing with the different congregation here in Thessalonica
in northwestern northeastern uh Greece area but we know brothers and sisters beloved by God that
he has chosen you and again he refers back to it as additional preaching to them because our message
of the gospel came to you not in word only but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full
conviction just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake our message
came to you not in word only it wasn't just that I was a great speaker and persuaded you but also in
the power in uh in power and the holy spirit and full conviction again preaching and power
go together here let's go back then if Derek can take us back to Romans chapter one I'd like to
suggest that a very well-known passage here might also be read at least partially through the lens
of what I'm talking about here Paul says in what this famous thesis to his epistle to the Romans
for I'm not ashamed of the gospel it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith
to the Jew first and also to the Greek for in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith
for faith as it is written the one who is righteous will live by faith now people I guess
traditionally see this as uh the righteousness of God being revealed in the death and resurrection
of Jesus in God's uh active forgiveness and mercy etc but I want to suggest that perhaps
not instead of that but perhaps along with that Paul says in verse four we put that back up again
he says in verse 17 in it the righteousness of God is revealed what's the antecedent that it here
the gospel in the gospel this is revealed well is he talking about the gospel message or is he
talking as he often does too about the proclamation of the gospel and we take it in the second way
we might say that in the preaching of the gospel when people are hearing it the righteousness of
God is made known is revealed in part by the power of God that works through it in verse 16 in other
words he could be talking here too about these acts of power that accompany the preaching of the gospel
and reveal then the truth of his message there's that you have to have faith in order to then benefit
from what God has done so take that for what it's worth but at least I think it's a possible way of
thinking about what he has in mind there it's not just the content of the message with a very
proclamation of it that is accompanied by the power you want to jump in there Derek I just want to
tease maybe I'm jumping ahead of ourselves here to ask am I jumping ahead by already asking what I
think that is being implied go ahead I'll come back so that that I think the reason you had me
skip this particular verse is that the gospel is the power which might be the signs and wonders
which might be what we're trying to say is the conviction it's technically the fact that this
message is tearing into your heart and changing people that you wouldn't expect would be changing
or wouldn't expect to come that is its power that is the sign that is the wonders instead of having
to expect Paul come along and go um hey stretch forth thine arm and their arm pops up into existence
you know what I mean yeah and that's certainly been a common way of trying to explain these texts
and then reading but the problem with that is that in all these other texts he makes a clear
distinction between the preaching and the mirror and and the power uh you know he says both of these
are there and so and the other thing is you know he he presents these in fact on as we go to the
next ones we'll see too uh these aren't something just accompanying his preaching he also sees this
as being active and working in the church and so um there I think Paul really he's not just saying
hey remember how you folks really felt convicted in your hearts he's saying hey remember those
things that happened that just you know we're we're clearly visibly evident uh uh evidence of
the power of god we're going to come back in a minute of questions I'm going to be saying that
and nobody at that time would have been surprised by what we would look at is miracles because
miracles are everywhere uh so that's kind of where I'm going to go with this okay let's go to the third
sheet there uh which is talking about uh the three more passages where Paul is talking about
the power of the spirit at work in his congregations in his absence so that this is not something
just associated with Paul so if we go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 a passage where Paul is
talking about uh the various gifts of the spirit that Paul has that god has placed in the church
and here there are all kinds of references to things that are uh some of them could be explained
as kind of supernatural enhancements of natural abilities but others are clearly uh what we would
call supernatural or miraculous acts so that there are now there are varieties of gifts but the
same spirit there are varieties of services but the same lord and there are varieties of activities
but it's the same god who activates all of them and everyone to each is given the manifestation of
the spirit for the common good to one is given through the spirit the utterance of wisdom
to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit
and to another faith by the same spirit those three are you know maybe a little more
natural human things you can imagine but then he goes on to say uh to another gifts of healing by
the one spirit to another the working in miracles to another prophecy to another discernment of
spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretations of tongues all
these are activated by one of the same spirit who are lots to each one of individually just as the
spirit chooses i don't want us to try to get sidetracked here and they're trying to understand
what he's referring to in each of those and you know what do they mean and all but just to get
the general impression here that we're talking about things that certainly seem to be uh saying
that the spirit is doing things that are not human not normally humanly possible the spirit is
enabling people and we see something similar in the second passage there in 1st Corinthians 14
where he's describing what a what a christian worship service if you want to call it that
would have been like in those days and reality is just a group of people gathered together
in somebody's living room to use our modern analogy and so he says uh it's nothing like
our most modern church services what should be done then my friends when you come together
each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation another is not just a pastor but everybody participating
a revelation a tongue an interpretation uh so things that are some things that could be
perhaps a bit more human a hymn a lesson but other things that are associated with some kind
of a divine activity revelation tongue interpretation let all things be done for building up if anyone
speaks in a tongue let there be only two or at most three and each in turn that one interpret
but if there's no one to interpret that can be silent in the church and speak to themselves
into god let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said if a revelation
is made to someone else sitting nearby let the first person be silent for you can all
prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged now i would say probably an
awful lot of churches if somebody starts doing those things they're going to kind of be calling
the ushers to come you know get rid of that person take them out of the church uh because we're used
to most of us church services that are kind of orderly and structured and perhaps liturgical
and there's nothing like that in the in the new testament it's all members participating
in each one being led and empowered by the spirit to do things or at least uh portrayed as being
somehow supernatural divine miraculous and finally our last passage okay go ahead i was just
going to say for people who don't know like this is why movements i think modern movements are trying
to go back like the quakers like uh you know these various spirit yeah so i that's all my
comment is so next yeah okay we'll come back to that too last one is one that's often overlooked
when people you know maybe you know about the lens of first christians 12 and 14 but Galatians 3
also makes a just a passing illusion to uh such things as well paul is really down on the Galatians
because they are accepting the idea many of them that one needs to be circumcised in order to be
part of the people of god which paul thinks is wrong as a denial of their faith so chapter 3 he
begins really fussing at them and he says uh in part of this fussing at them are you so foolish
having started with the spirit are you not ending with the flesh that is thinking you have to do
something to your body like circumcision when what you really need is just the presence and power of
the spirit did you experience so much for nothing notice the word experience there if it really was
for nothing well then does god supply you with the spirit and work miracles among you by you're
doing the works of the law or by you're believing what you've heard does god supply you with the
spirit and work miracles among you he just kind of assumes god is doing miracles among them uh
and that they will know what he's talking about uh the question is just uh do they obviously his
answer is kind of rhetorical of course you don't have to be circumcised in order to be able to do
these miracles by the spirit of god so we had at least two churches uh Corinthia Corinth and
Galatians we see him just assuming these kind of miraculous things are going on uh two other
churches it was Thessalonica he refers to them being occurred having occurred in his initial
preaching and in Romans he talks about them as if it's well known non-controversial everyone
knows this is what's going on so what is going on that is the question the classic answer and this
is where you want us to go is to go to the book of acts because uh the book of acts tells many
stories of paul doing miracles and you know of course the classic christian into idea is that
you know the bible is the word of god it all goes together uh you you want to just kind of integrate
acts and paul together and here's your answer uh you know it's solved right so let's quickly look
at i don't want to take time to read through every detail there but let's let's quickly at some of
the stories in the book of acts where paul is doing miracles and see what kinds of things people have
traditionally thought is that okay Derek you want to go on yes sir all right let's do it so um i've
actually got about seven of these what kind of skim over so first we have here a situation where paul
is confronting a magician as it's called here named ellimus uh who is trying to turn a roman
pro consel away from what paul is saying so notice verse nine but paul saw also known as paul filled
with the holy spirit looked intently at him and said you son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness
full of all deceit and villainy will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the lord
and now listen the hand of the lord is against you and you will be blind for a while unable to
see the sun immediately mist in darkness came about over him and he went about groping for
someone to leave him by the hand kind of a negative miracle but interestingly verse 12
when the pro consel saw what had happened he believed so here's an instance at least in the
book of acts of a a miracle even though it's a a harmful miracle leading to someone believing
interesting huh um acts 18 the next one uh paul he goes into listra and there's a man sitting who
was crippled he couldn't use his feet never walked and he listened to paul as he was speaking and paul
looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed said in a loud voice stand
up right on your feet and the man sprang up and began to walk now the interesting sequel to this
which i didn't copy here in this story the result spots is not to believe his message because he's
not really proclaimed us uh the people of listra start worship so start wanting to make offerings
to solve and barnacles as gods i know mercury in human form now again as i it's not an instance of
somebody being persuaded of the truth his message but what do they say miracles gods and so this idea
that the presence of some act of power shows the presence of divinity and therefore affirms the
credentials of the actor and perhaps the truth of what they're saying is something at least acts
is portraying as being common outside of the church and i think i'm going to argue in a minute uh
that's because this was just normal in the ancient world so let's go on act chapter 16
this is a story that some people may know about this odd little story of a slave girl
who is uh has a spirit of divination and her owners make money off her fortune telling
and she's going around it's just strange verse 17 she's going around following paul and saying
these men are slaves of the most high god who proclaim to you a way of salvation
you think paul would be saying hey see look listen to her no she kept doing this for many days he
just got so annoyed he turned inside of the spirit i order you in the name of jesus christ to come out
of her and it came out that very hour now again i don't make any sense of that story i'm not going
to try to do that uh i'm not sure i can but again my point is here we have paul doing a
miracle of exorcism uh which he never ever mentions in his letters right there we got a bit of a
problem uh next to next chapter 19 um probably the wildest one of these god did extraordinary
miracles uh through paul so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin
were brought to the sick their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them
wow i mean this is where some of the tv preachers who might talk about give me money and i'll send
you you know a piece of my garment or this sacred oil or something you can put it on you and and be
healed this is where that comes from you know the idea and and again as odd as this might sound to us
we have you know in the uh jewish scriptures the impurity can be transmitted by physical contact
and in the grecker room world there are various ways in which physical contact was seen as being
able to transmit good or bad supernatural power so this would not have seen as strange to ancient
readers as it does to us x 20 uh just very briefly here a guy is uh in uticus is listening to paul's
preach falls asleep falls out the window how many people can relate to falling asleep in church
and paul it says verse 10 took him up in his arms and said don't be alarmed for his life is in him
and then he uh they took the boy away alive uh wouldn't that's a miracle or not it's a little bit
i think that the that luke wants us to take that as a miraculous resurrection that it could just
be that paul saw the guy's heart was still beating so i hesitate to put that one in this category
but i think most people do read that as a miraculous story two more uh at the end of his journey is
when paul is being carried to roam as a captive the his his ship shipwrecks and the end of an island of
malta and it says paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood was putting on the fire when a viper
a snake poisoned a snake driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand when the
names saw the creature hanging from his hand they said to one another this man must be a murderer
though he's escaped from the sea justice is not allowed to inflict notice again they're their
charges the gods are at work in this thing in the coming of this snake out of the fire
and biting this man you know greeks and romans saw gods at work everywhere uh everything is a sign
or an omen or a supernatural work he however shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no
harm and this is they wondered at this again this shows him to be someone who's got great power
and then right after that uh finally the last one acts chapter 28 verses 8 to 9 it so happened
that the father of publius a man they were staying with their lay sick in bed with fever and dysentery
paul visited him and cured him by praying and putting his hands on him after this happened the
rest of the people of the island who had diseases and also came also came and were cured so what
do we have here according to the book of acts paul uh healed people uh both directly uh sometimes
is not explained how sometimes just by speech uh in the one occasion we've got simply not even on
his initiative people simply taking claws that have been in contact with his body uh like the
woman who touches the hem of jesus garment a couple of the stories along those lines and simply being
healed uh we've got paul casting out demons we've got paul being invulnerable to a snake uh we've
got paul maybe raising a guy from the dead paul casting uh making a guy a bad guy go blind um
pretty wide assortment isn't it and and yet not a word about any of this in paul's letters uh
in fact as i was saying in the last uh episode here uh paul doesn't seem to have benefited
off of miraculous healings you know you'd think if he was a healer he'd just go be healed
right or he would be healed by one of these people who has gifts of healing in the church
or something like that and so we have uh a lot of tension here um and you know paul talks about
miracles going on in these churches but something is happening in conjunction with his preaching
we don't know what we've got lots of tantalizing bits of evidence here of some things supernatural
we could even add to this if you want to say uh okay so none of these things are mentioned in paul's
letters he never says he's an exorcist he never says that he heals uh he does in first christians
five uh curse a guy uh and and curse him would be throwing out in the church about three inches
as we pronounce his curses this might be a little bit like making the guy blind um but uh nothing
has a physical consequence like that the what we do find in paul is that he prays in tongues
and he has revelations and interestingly those two appear in the book of acts not at paul's hands
but the coming of the spirit is manifested by people speaking in tongues and prophesying uh
and there are revelations coming in dreams uh so it's a different world than we live in so let's
use that as a jumping off point i'll get you jump in darryl but uh for talking about what's the world
in which this is being set up and what ancient people might have thought about seeing these kind
of texts but you want to you want to talk here a little bit darryl i'm going on too long here no no
no yeah you're fine i i'm glad we got through the the pericapies and we were able to discuss
the difference between what ax is doing and what paul is doing for our audience to really take
pay close attention to that because it's only another step i mean ax just takes it a whole
another step and people will say but see the continuity i'm more and this is just me thinking
ax after reading pervo is very literary it has a powerful literary intention to it and and
you pointing out rightfully that the mind of omens and superstitions and things like that are
important i mean these are things that everyone's thinking whereas today there some people are
thinking it and some people aren't in america like i can go and i step on a crack and go hey
you stepped on a crack man break your mama's back man what are you doing hold on man what are you
talking about that's not true uh it was probably commonly understood that a snake bite causes this
or it's from that god or you did something wrong or this is just the way it is and even today people
still do this where they say that's karma karma came back to get them because look at what they did
so it's in us today the the difference might be that it's heightened and even encouraged in the
society by the most scientific minded i mean you know there's not like all right we're a level of
science now we're outside of superstition in those days i don't think that they were separated
like that there might have been a few scientists that weren't but if we're in that mindset this begs
the question to me as someone who came out of a very fundamentalist we were like a non-denominational
pentecostal type church where i spoke in tongues i sang in in tongues in the spirit would just sit
there to the music and go into a meditative state if you will um we would prophesy and we would lay
on of hands and things like that uh that sounds like Corinth that sounds like paul and it also makes
me think about the whole rhetoric in galatians paul is an interesting guy this whole debate with paul
paul's and i'll shut up after this but the the point is paul when he says uh in that galatians
three passage what the heck man you experienced the power of god which made me think like when
people go what the heck Derek didn't you experience those things when you were in the church wasn't
that experience enough even though i've rationalized to explain what i think it is now and and why i
think there's a natural explanation at the end of the day of why i was doing it and all that
they're not thinking that the point is paul's going you experience that and now you want to go
snippier you know what and try and convert become a proselyte um you don't need that and then he
makes the in my opinion he makes this sophisticated for its contemporaneous time paul is being a very
clever exegete and reestablishing terms in abraham when he says stuff like you know he is the father
of a multitude of goyim right uh gentiles right and of course in the original context it probably
doesn't mean anything like this but it's a brilliant move and he's trying to say stop trying to become
literally abraham seed you're adopted as abraham seed and and um i just i had to connect that to
make the point like his is more like a charismatic movement that that to me seems to be what the
miracle is is that you uttered in tongues with me you were part of this and you experienced it that's
what it seems like to me and in fact although i wasn't going to get any of this i'll mention it
that um we continue to have um numerous reports of similar kinds of things for the next several
centuries in various church fathers so this is something that uh was not unique to paul or the
book of acts but uh you know everything that's referred to say in the book of acts in terms of
healings and exorcisms and uh all kinds of you know miraculous things they claim are still going
on in their day so that again raises some interesting questions about what do we do about all that
let me ask you that oh yeah i was going to say what would you say the difference is uh as an expert
as as a historian or someone who's looking at history someone who's a skeptic uh coming into
this and i say you're a skeptic because you know how to sift and and differentiate things
very carefully um what would you say is going on in acts versus what we're finding in paul and how
would you categorize those two but anyway let me let's come back to that question okay a few words
about the broader world in which these are taking place because here's the issue we come to texts
like the book of acts uh same thing with the gospels and jesus miracles i think most modern
well of course obviously if you've been raised in church uh as you and i both were and where you
just talked to accept this and don't question it well you know there it is i mean the issue is
these are miracles uh end of question but i would say if you want to approach this kind of with a
modern western scientific worldview and whether you whether one uh uh holds that consciously
or just influenced by it by being part of our culture it's there to be skeptical initially
right off the bat about any kind of miraculous or supernatural kind of things not many people in
our culture today in america or say europe or such would say uh if they haven't been cultivated
and trained to view these things as normal would say oh wow that's great they'd say huh
my real quick you're gonna laugh my wife when she first met me she i fell in love with her
she fell in love with me in love with me we're in high school i took her to the house church that
that i was part of the music started and i'm sitting there i'm just speaking in tongues and
she looked at me and she i didn't pay attention to her you know i was just doing my thing and the
next thing you know when we left she's like i'm gonna be honest with you that was the weirdest
and you guys are definitely different she didn't want to tell me that like it really freaked her
out but she was definitely not a big fan of it at all yeah and so i think we approach it because
we've been we're so deeply influenced without realizing by kind of what modern western secular
scientific mindset to be skeptical of such things there was no such thing in the ancient world
everyone believed that the world was permeating by the gods by supernatural presences and that's
let's say a bit about that try to use your imagination uh anybody listening here and
kind of put aside everything you've been taught about uh you know science and secularism and such
that you know for the greeks and the romans there were gods and spirits everywhere you know
for the greeks there are there are nymphs and in the springs and the streams there are dryads in
the trees there are not you know far more than just the olympian deities there there's you know
pan and his satyrs and main ads out in the woods doing all kinds of orgiastic things and and just
you can go on and on and on the lists of uh everywhere you went when you were encountering
deities uh in the iliad the gods and goddesses are literally fighting on the battlefield on both
sides of the army and they get injured uh and uh so you know the idea of gods who can be injured
in warfare is another thing that just seems so so weird to us they can't die but they can be injured
and they take the ambrosia later and get cured again um and you go to the roman world and even
more so i mean the romans have literally a deity for about everything you can imagine i mean you
go into your house and there's a deity associated with the door sill and there's a deity associated
with the threshold and there's a deity associated with different rooms and you know where you go you
you make offerings you make prayers you and you've got these uh in both greek and roman
modes of thinking there are um harmful spirits who are out to get you they go by different names and
the romans even divinize those beings such that diseases have divine names and so one goddess
is associated with famine another goddess is associated with fever another with uh you know
rabies or whatever the case may be and so everything is seen as um imbued with divinity
even among the more uh you know the earliest uh more kind of quasi scientific thinkers and the
Hippocratic medical tradition as i said in the last episode they credited their healing of power
to the greek goddess celebius some of them were priests of a celebius um they believed in and
commended astrology and dream interpretation the gods revealing things in dreams and prayer and
offering sacrifices to gods especially in uh more extreme cases that they didn't think they could
handle and so everybody with the exception of a few atheistic weirdos like derrick here
thought that the world was pervaded by divine spirits and it's not a matter of of god or the
gods being somewhere off far away and then intervening in this world in a way that's not
normal the gods are everywhere they're always acting they're always speaking they're always
apparent to humans for good and for ill and so you know much of what religion consists of
in Greek enrollment circles and also in most indigenous religions is various kinds of ritual
acts primarily sacrifices and prayers but other things too to um get the good gods on your side
and keep the bad ones away from you and you are uh exchanging favors i give to you the gods
so that you will give to me or you have given to me and done something good from me and therefore
i'd be something back to you again we're in a very different world i mean we don't think in terms
of kind of putting god in our debt by doing some kind of a ritual i hey god you owe me more now
because i gave you my biggest to my biggest best ox you know and the sacrifice or something like that
and something's you're being wrong if you don't heal my child now you know this this became a huge
issue as well and i'm jumping ahead but just to say for people that there may be some real valid
reasoning behind why rome was freaking out with the conversion to christianity because you're forsaking
you're the gods you are forsaking the ones who are going to keep rome intact and i bet you pagans
in the fifth sixth century with the collapse that that happened in rome probably said that very
thing and thought you guys did it i knew it okay but that's yeah that's the main theme of augustians
famous work the city of god his idea the pagans are claiming exactly that all these things are
happening because we abandoned the gods and augustin says no no no that's not what's going on here so
you're very much right in fact we want to talk about why were jews and christians viewed very
negatively in the ancient world we could have a whole top subject old talk on that but in a nutshell
partly they would just wacko weirdos and the things they believed and did in some respects i mean
yeah well we can get into that later but the other thing is they're seen as politically subversive
because every city and also the empire when we come to rome has patron gods and goddesses and
while it's okay you can believe whatever you want you can worship and follow as many gods as you want
and all that but you need to participate in the civic cult you need to be willing to support the
particular patron god or goddess of our city or of the empire or whatever and if you're unwilling
to do that because you believe they're not true gods and in fact that maybe they are demons in
some way or the other then it's not that they're think you know going to do bad things to you
because what you believe because you're weird it's because you're politically dangerous because
you're someone is also religiously dangerous getting to what you're saying because the god of goddess
is not going to take care of us if we don't engage collectively in these rituals so a little bit
like in the in the jewish scriptures the idea that when some the when the leaders of society are
doing wrong by worshiping other gods abusing the poor etc etc everybody suffers because you know
some foreign armies come in to invade and overcome them and all that kind of thing and so it's the
community as a whole religion is a communal thing it's not so much an individual yes it has
individual expression but the fundamental conception of religion in greek and roman and jewish
circles is it's the community's relationship whether that be the city or the region or the empire
or whether it be the people uh they have relationship with the god or the gods that's
maintained primarily by ritual behavior it can also be to some degree by moral behavior
and so this gods are always acting yeah i was gonna say this gives us a background
imaginative background because we can't fully we don't have the whole picture but we have a great
imaginative background what paul was up against uh and paul doesn't he mention and i don't know if
this is something you could comment on but whereas he says go eat the bean strangle the idols no
problem there's no power in that you see the yada yada yada but in other places doesn't he say with
his own tongue that the daemons are coming after me like they're like me so he is dealing with he
is granting that there are spirits other than the god that he is saying is the true all powerful
that are that are attacking him yeah we believe they're attacking him so i i wonder if he's hearing
from pagans but also he himself knows the pagan world as a roman citizen and is thinking
tough right now i think these daemons are really attacking me they're coming after me there's
i don't know i think let's let's use that to make a a bit even more complicated matters we have
we have two category two prime i mean if you are a religion even if a religious person we tend to
divide reality into two spheres there is god there's the realm of god of the gods and then there's a
realm of humans and never the twain shall meet there's such thing among the greeks and romans
there are gradations between humanity and divinity and so you can have a human who becomes uh
divinized either during life or after death and oftentimes they're referred to as heroes you can
have gods who come and take on human form put on disguise like jupiter coming and having sex with
various women or mercury or hermes coming as a messenger or whatever the case may be there
which is why those people in this trip thought they could be Zeus and hermes because
they did appear as human beings and then you've got beings are an intermediary you have of course in
jewish circles you have the idea of angels and the greek enrollment world the i the world the word
is dimonics uh dimon which is the same word between our word demon in the new testament and
christian thinking we tend to think of demons as evil beings part of the army of satan that is not
what dimon a smith in the greek enrollment world a dimon was a being somewhere in between a human
being and a god and so um when the church fathers later on are talking about um um they they
interesting they accept that asclepias does miracles that healings occur at these shrines
of the greek god asclepias and so what are they going to do about it now we'll use some examples
of these in a minute well they say okay okay we grant you that that those are real miracles
but they're being done by dimonics uh by the diamonds by these kind of intermediary beings
not by the one through god and for them that also carries the connotation that they're evil beings
and so the the distinction is not in christian circles is kind of a using it in both ways at
the same time and i think in paul's case he does the same they are lesser divine beings
so there are so the idea you know just to broaden this a quick little reference
the idea of a god becoming a human being wasn't a big deal uh the idea of a god being exalted a
human being exalted to heaven after death was not a big deal i mean they were obviously unusual
highly unusual events but they weren't something that was unique when christians would say such
things about jesus oh this this opens up amazing can of worms that people will never have a time
to get into all of this i mean eventually we'll touch on this you you bring up the whole this this
begs the question of gentile and and jewish uh how much relations they had in and how much
hellenism was impacted in jewish thought also the idea of god coming down and appearing in
human form in the heber bible so that played a part it's already president there and and here
you have hellenistic jews who are impacted by the idea of the greek heroes they know these stories
especially when they learn greek they know homer they know these liter literary uh uh text and then
there's they're finding a way to go huh you know i see that in the heber bible for example i was
reading a book yesterday i'm dealing with how much did pagan rome impact the jews and i'm talking like
the the what we see in the mishnah the talmud like how much impacted pagan rome often scholars
want to talk about christian rome versus jewish people and they're thinking pagan rome's impact
and the laws that are set and one of the interpretations of one of the rabbis really
blew me away i loved it it was um he said you know for the non-jew who isn't able to convert
because his father was not a jew but his mother was and the father was a pagan he can say uh
deuteronomy in the deuteronomy passage the lord of your fathers but he can't say ours because he's
not one of us well then later one of the rabbis said no no no no he is one of us because abram's
name was once abram which according to uh philo means high father or something to this effect
like high father but then was changed to abraham which meant the father of a multitude of goyim
so they interpreted this gentiles in a in a synchronic manner in their own personal situation
when originally this would have been like hey it's a generic term to mean you're gonna be the
father of multiple people esau you name it like different nations but we clearly we clearly have
got to have a talk about jews and gentiles i mean i've done a lot of work on that i got a
book in process on that um but let me let me um just for your listeners let me read you some
examples of uh uh miracles done by uh other people and the carominal wall you know so for example um
at the here's some a couple of some of these are fairly long i read you a couple of short ones
of uh reports of healings that occurred uh yeah at least they reported it occurred at the uh
shrine of asclepius at epidaurus these are all from like about fourth century bc um
so um let's see boy so many of them here a man whose fingers with the exception of one were
paralyzed came as a suppliant to the god while looking at the tablets in the sanctuary reports
of other miracles he expressed incredulity regarding the cures and scoffed at the inscriptions
you don't even have to have faith to be healed at the asclepius temples but in his sleep he saw
a vision it seemed to him that as he was playing it dice below the temple it was about to cast the
dice the god appeared sprang upon his hand and stretched out his fingers when the god had stepped
aside it seemed to him that he bent his hand and stretched out all his fingers one by one and then
when he uh wakes up what do you know his hand is okay or um a voiceless boy came as a suppliant to
the sanctuary for his voice when he performed the preliminary sacrifices and fulfilled the
usual rights there upon the temple servant who brings in the fire for the god looking at the
boy's father demanded he should promise to bring within a year the thank offering for the cure
if he obtained that for which he had come but the boys now there's a boy who couldn't speak
the boy suddenly said i promise his father was startled at this and asked him to repeat it the
boy repeated the words and after that became well and there are a lot of days there's one without
the guy who was born without eyeballs in his socket oh people somebody who's pregnant for five years
there's things like that or Josephus um tells his story about a a junior eliezer who um casts a
demon out of a man in the presence of the roman emperor vespasian he says the manner of the cure
was this he put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon a kind of magical
root that can be used in a sacred amulet to the nostrils of the demoniac after which he drew out
the demon through his nostrils and when the man fell down immediately he had georgian to return
into him no more making still mention of Solomon and reciting reciting the incantations which he
composed a lot of things here we can get into with regard to magic he's got an amulet he's recited
reciting incantations um and when eliezer would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that
he had such a power he set a little cup uh he set a little way off a cup or basin full of water and
commanded the demon as he went out of the man to overturn it and thereby to let the spectators know
he had left the man and when this was done the skill and wisdom of Solomon was shown very manifestly
for which reason it is that all men may know the vastness of Solomon's abilities etc etc so again
the miracles attesting to the the power of someone and then again whose name it is done here and
could we do a lot let me be one more uh the emperor vespasian himself emperors were often
associated with the ability to do supernatural things and vespasian before he is the emperor
i'm sorry he's a new emperor and he is um in um uh alexandria says the man of the people who was
blind and another who was lame came to him together as he sat on the tribunal begging for the help
for their disorders which syrapus egyptian god had promised in a dream for the god declared that
vespasian would restore the eyes if he would spit upon them and give strength of the leg if he
would dame to touch it with his heel though he had had hardly any faith now this is vespasian
had hardly any faith that this could possibly succeed and therefore shrank even from making the
attempt he was at last persuaded upon by his friends and tried both things in public before a large
crowd and with success at the same time by the direction of certain soothsayers some vases of
antique workmanship were dug up in a consecrated spot at tegeya and arcadia and what do you know
one of them was an image very like vespasian you know so it's just so we could go on and on and on
and on but the the the bottom line is that we have here um we are dealing in paul's letters and the
book of acts with a very very different world oh actually i have to read you a couple more from
apollonius of tia tiana okay a guy who is said to have uh probably lived in the late first century
and traveled around an asia minor in syria and other places mesopotamia and he is in many ways
portrayed as being like jesus a fascinating story written down in the third century by a greek
author named phillistratus and so a man came to him he was lame he was 30 years old has a keen
hunter of lions but the lion has sprung upon him and dislocated his hip so that he limped with one
leg however however when they massage with their hands his hip the youth immediately recovered
his upright gait and another man had his eyes put out and he went away having recovered the
side of both of them yet another man had his hand paralyzed but left their presence in full
possession of the limb and a certain woman had suffered in labor already seven times that was
healed in the following way through the intercession of her husband he bade the man whenever his wife
he hears apollonius should be about to bring forth her next child to enter her chamber carrying in
his bosom a live hair that is a rabbit that he was to walk once around her at the same moment
to release the hair and for that the womb would be extruded together with the fetus unless the
hair was at once driven out and it goes on and on and on and on so uh yeah we're dealing with a very
different world here than anything that we would imagine to experience and so yeah what is going
on what do we make of all this yeah yeah i just suggest there are at least three possible ways of
making sense of it one is uh this is all just a bunch of rods and the same is true when we have
the same could be applied as people often do to reports today in pedacosts and charismatic churches
or in other religions of miraculous healings and miracles and raisings of the deaths it's all just
fraud it's gullible people as people who you know aren't as smart and wise and you know
knowledgeable as we are because we all know such things can't happen a second is that
modern western scientists are just too narrow scientifically influenced people are just too
narrow minded uh you know it is this i i there's a guy an anthropologist who wrote a book uh
that i ran across this morning um i was looking for it as a term the enchanted universe it's often
said that the greeks and romans did then enchanted universe that is a universe surrounded by gods and
spirits a universe in which uh uh the supernatural what we would think of is normal supernatural
is not even a relevant word because that assumes that there is a natural in a supernatural division
which they didn't have uh but this guy named marshall solans an anthropologist you know very
famous in this field wrote a book called the new science of the enchanted universe an anthropology
of most of humanity and it's uh the description is saying from the perspective of western modernity
humanity inhabits a disenchanted cosmos god's spirit and ancestors have left us
for a transcendent beyond no longer living in our midst and being involved in all matters of
everyday life from the trivial to the dire yet the vast majority of cultures throughout human
history create spirits as very real persons members of a cosmic society who interact with humans
and control their faith in most cultures even today people are but a small part of an enchanted
universe misconstrued by the transcendent categories of religion and supernatural and so he wants to
say you know let's talk about what's more normal in the world and uh you know as an as an anthropologist
he's not trying to make a case that they're you know which of the other is true but he wants to
say that actually throughout if you take the vantage point of human history it's modern western
secular scientific mindsets that is the aberration yeah we're the weirdo you know modern westerners
are the weirdo wacko people by comparison with what most human beings have thought maybe maybe
we're just all wrong you know and and i don't think that i don't use wrong in a negative sense
because one could i think even from a scientific standpoint you could say science doesn't answer
everything science can't science is methodologically atheistic it has to assume that there are no
deities and divinities making my spirit and experimental results come out a certain way
or whatever the case may be but somebody who is an honest scientist has to say science can't say
one way or the other whether there's god's spirits out there or anything like that there's a lot of
science has its limited parameters that it can pronounce upon and and it's wrong to take it
beyond that to make metaphysical judgments about on the basis of scientific world etc
um the third offer um possibility i'll offer that it can apply at least to the healings
in some cases though it's uh it doesn't make sense of you know the other things is uh work
that's been done by scientists in recent years uh the last few decades on the placebo effect
and in fact i think probably most people know that term the placebo effect but don't know enough
about it so let me say a quick couple of words about it and we're gonna have to start wrapping
this up pretty soon i think but a lot of fascinating stuff here to talk about absolutely i think that
you probably know that a placebo is somebody taking a uh you know a sugar pill or something
like that that is going to um that they think is a real medicine and that uh in some way that the
you know often you don't understand um something like this actually produces some kind of a
healing effect um scientists have been studying this medical research in particular in the last
few decades in a way that um actually uh is saying that the cebo effect is not only real
but it's something that is involved in uh all experiences of even the most scientific medical
treatment that anywhere up to 30 from 30 to as estimated at 30 to 60 of the effect of genuine
medications uh is placebo effect what do we mean by that basically placebo has to do with
uh that healing is occurring not because of what's in the substance but because of the context
in which it is uh offered that is we are uh the giving of a medication is surrounded by
on environment in which somebody with a white coat in a particular kind of office comes to you
and gives you something and is basically you have trust that this substance is going to
cure you and that this uh our bodies uh we know from experience you know most things that we get
sick from our bodies just get rid of on their own we have self-curing capabilities in our bodies
and so that basically the argument is that by that a particular social context can create
faith in such a way that any substance one takes or any action one takes can activate
the body's self-healing capacities okay well i'm sorry derrick had my i think my computer overheated
there and froze so good to be back with you just to wrap up what i was saying about the placebo
effect not quite sure what i said or not but in essence that by surrounding a person with a
particular kind of environment it can activate faith and trust in this substance or this ritual
or this whatever context that will activate the body's self-healing mechanisms and other
scholars have applied this to studying pita costal healing services roman catholic healing
services and there does seem to be a lot of validity to seeing this at least as a possibility
and studying the various ways in which the person who is directing things or even just the person
themselves is generating a certain level of faith that produces bodily healing even things that might
seem miraculous and so you know still that doesn't take us where we go with many of the other kind
of more nature miracles or other things or things that we want to talk about next time i think in
regard to magic and rituals but i hope this has at least gotten us into this world a bit i still
haven't answered the question about what paul is what's going on in paul's churches and just to say
quick word i don't know i think in the end there's certainly a lot of interesting possibilities
that one could put forward healings exorcism the coming of the spirit and tongues and prophecies
and uh or you know you could try to make a case for it being as you said entirely internal kind
of things so i find hard to see how that works but i think at least part of it it is at least
possible that what i argue in my book is that paul the arrival of a new preacher in town who
seems to preach is about a god it can be miraculous things and has done them may have been sufficient
to cause some people who came together to hear him to believe oh now i can finally get healed and
they find this in this particular setting this particular person this particular message something
that is uh and not to kick them over into that state of bodily restoration that they didn't
credit to paul and to paul's god become christ followers it wouldn't take many of those paul
does not say every one of you have experienced something like this could have just been two or
three episodes episodes you know of people having something like this and so that might be all that
paul is referring to and that we might be you know blowing it out of proportion to think this is
something that everybody was experiencing or somehow is part of becoming a christ follower
so anyway maybe i'll try to wrap it up with that and we can continue to explore this strange world
of people you know believing that by their own actions they can manipulate gods or spirits or
supernatural forces to do their bidding and interestingly to find out that jews and christians
did that too and not just in relation to the god of isra they too practiced things that we would
kind of use the modern word magic for us and we'll get into that in our next conversation
wow thank you so much for that this has been a blast i look forward to getting into magic in the
ancient world as well and maybe we'll remember to try and deal with what is axe doing that is
enhancing paul because there's there's definitely something is a second century you know we talk
about some of this stuff so leave you on the cliffhanger if you want to check out magic
in the ancient world stay tuned to be sure to go to his website everybody go check out the books
it is a slavesstory.com all in the description go to amazon if you can't go there or for whatever
reason you don't go there and last of all check out our patreon i've got so much material i've been
doing please consider joining us and helping us out thank you so much for today can i say one last
word please i really tried hard to create this enchanted world in those novels and kind of the
idea of the lived experience of divinities and engaging with them on a regular basis so you'll
get my best imagination of what it is to live in this kind of world in those novels thank you so
much chris i appreciate you and everybody check out the work don't forget we are
you
you
