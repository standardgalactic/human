Too much empty space for these thoughts and hits a long way down
All alone, face to face with the darkness that I know so well
Just let me go
When the lights are gone
In the ancient world, God's granted kings the right to rule and to administer justice in the land
In the third millennium BCE, King Urnami left behind a list of laws that he created under Divine Authority
Later, the famous King Hammurabi of Babylon set up a similar but much larger set of laws where he is depicted as receiving the right to rule from the sun god Shamash
Throughout the millennia, kings were bestowed with the authority to judge their people with fairness and equity and they committed these judgments and laws to writing for us to view today
Similarly, in the Hebrew Bible, we see lists of laws that have been passed down to us from generation to generation
In the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, we see collections that contain regulations concerning everything from murder to theft to returning a wandering animal
Perhaps surprisingly included in all of these lists from both inside and outside the Bible are laws that endorse the practice of slavery
One human owning another human as property
While you might not be shocked to learn that people in the ancient world thought it was okay to own people as property
It may have caught you off guard that the Bible contained laws endorsing the practice of slavery
The presence of laws relating to slavery in the Bible is often quite jarring to those who hold these texts as being handed down by the Most High God
I mean, how could a text either divinely inspired by God or forming the foundation for a religion that has persisted for over 2,000 years contain laws that endorse the appropriate practice of slavery
What was slavery like as described in the Hebrew Bible? Were there really laws that endorsed owning other people as property?
If so, how did these laws compare to those from other ancient cultures in the region?
If there was genuine slavery in the laws of the Old Testament, what about the New Testament? Did the New Testament condemn the social institution of slavery?
Finally, how does all of this compare to the horrific and dehumanizing slavery that took place in the Anabellum South?
Were the laws in the Old Testament in any way similar to the laws that were in place in America at the time?
Before we look at the specific biblical passages, it is important to define our terms
While the definition of slavery can have nuanced meanings depending on the context in which the term is used
There are essential aspects that can be seen throughout
In what follows, we will essentially define slavery as a condition in which an individual or rights to their labor is owned by another
Either temporarily or permanently, the owner controls and is legally allowed to derive benefit from the actions and activities of the owned individual
My goal here will be to give you a broad overview of slavery in the laws of the Old Testament
We will examine select portions of three primary legal sections in the Old Testament that deal with the issue of slavery
Exodus 21, Deuteronomy 15 and Leviticus 25
Following some limited commentary on these passages, we will briefly examine the common apologetic
That attempts to use the New Testament to explain God allowing slavery in the Old Testament because of man's sinfulness
All of this information and so much more can be found in Dr. Joshua Bowen's new book, Did the Old Testament Endorse Slavery?
Second edition
You can find the link in the description below
He is an Assyriologist who not only knows the Hebrew language as well as Assyrians, Sumerians and other languages
He sources the endless scholars who recognize this topic in depth as well
Exodus 21
Let's begin with Exodus chapter 21 in verses 2 through 6 we read
The Hebrew slave six years he will serve and in the seventh he will go out free without payment
If he comes in alone he will go out alone
If he is the husband of a wife then his wife will go out with him
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters
The woman and her children belong to the master but he will go out alone
But if the slave in fact says I love my master and my wife and my children I will not go out free
Then his master will bring him to God even to the door or the doorpost
And his master will pierce his ear with an aw and he will serve him forever
An Israelite buys a fellow Israelite likely due to impoverishment and the law sets the limit of debt service to six years
What are the rules that govern this debt slave service?
The male debt slave is to serve for six years and be released free of debt in the seventh
Thus the principal any interest and or additional charges would be satisfied by the six years of service
This is the basic rule concerning the male Hebrew slave
However there are other circumstances to be considered in this transaction
If he comes in alone he will go out alone
If he is the husband of a wife then his wife will go out with him
Exodus 21 3
This seems fairly straightforward
If the debt slave is purchased as a single man he is to be released a single man
If he was enslaved as a married man both he and his wife go free upon his release in the seventh year
So far so good however the situation is complicated in verse four
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters the woman and her children belong to the master but he will go out alone
The text has set forth the general principle that a Hebrew slave can only be made to service for six years in order to pay off his debt
Now we are dealing with a different scenario that can occur within the general principle
If he is single when he comes in he goes out single
But what if he comes into the slave owner's household married in that case he will go out married
In other words as you came in that's how you go out
This would also apply therefore to Hebrew slave who is given a wife by his master during his term of service
Because she was the property of the master the law required that she remain his property along with any children that she would produce
In other words although the male debt slave has a set term of service
The female slave and her children are chattel slaves that remain the property of their owner when he goes out
When he goes out he goes out without them
This stipulation in the law explains what follows in Exodus 21 5 through 6
But if the slave in fact says I love my master and my wife and my children I will not go out free
Then his master will bring him to God even to the door or the door post and his master will pierce his ear with an awl and he will serve him forever
The male debt slave is left with two options
First he can exercise his right to release in the seventh year and go on his way
However he would do so alone
His second option would be to remain with his wife and children continuing to serve as a slave in the master's home
Because his wife and children are the property of the master
Not subject to release after the set term of service
Remaining with his family is contingent upon him dedicated himself to lifetime service to the master
If the male debt slave decides to remain with his master wife and children
He swears an oath of lifelong servitude and is marked with the rest of his family as a chattel slave
Having dealt with the rules for the male debt slave the text turns to the female slave
And if a man sells his daughter as a female slave she will not go out like the male slaves
If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who has designated her for himself then he must let her be redeemed
He may not sell her to foreign people as he dealt treacherously with her
And if he designates her for his son he must treat her according to custom of daughters
If he takes another wife for himself her food her clothing and her marital rights he cannot diminish
And if these three things he does not do for her then she will go out free without payment of money
Exodus 21 7 through 11
Here the passage speaks of a man selling his daughter as a slave in order to satisfy a debt
In this case she is entering into a sexual relationship with either her master or his son
And given this relationship and its social and financial consequences to her value
She is to receive certain rights from her master
Her status must be changed either to a wife or a concubine
As her sexual and reproductive capacities are now in use
This also means that unlike the male debt slave who was also used in a reproductive capacity
But without the social and financial consequences she is not to be released after six years
This affords her protection as odd as that may sound
As her master must provide for her even if she falls out of favor with him
He cannot reduce her to the status of a simple slave and sell her to foreigners
He must continue to provide for her or allow her to be redeemed
Before we leave this section of Exodus we should briefly consider the question of the daughter's consent in this situation
Does she agree to be sold as a female slave?
I make a more detailed argument elsewhere but the text clearly is not concerned with her opinion on the matter
Hebrew Bible scholar William Prop agrees
In 217 the subject is the girl's father not her purchaser
In contrast the paraphrase in Deuteronomy 1512 when your Hebrew brother or sister sells him or herself
Empathizes more with the slave and in fact contains more liberal provisions
Exodus stresses rather the woman's passivity subject to the authority first of her father and then of her purchaser
Perhaps no other passage is more frequently discussed in slavery debates than Exodus 21 20-21
And if man beats his male or female slave with a wooden rod so that they die immediately he will surely be punished
However if he survives a day or two he will not be punished because he is his property
It is unsurprising that these two verses carry so much significance in the discussion
The text describes a scenario in which either a male or female slave is beaten with a wooden rod
Which sounds justifiably horrific to us
We need to expect that this was the purpose of the law
Don't beat your male or female slave with a wooden rod
Of course we know that this was not the law's intent
The question is how should we understand the purpose of this regulation
While it might seem as though the law is giving a slave holder a type of manual on how to legally beat their slave within an inch of their lives
I don't think that this interpretation correctly understands the passage in its context
It is absolutely true that masters beat their slaves and this passage indicates that
If a master beats their slave and they survive a day or two that there is no punishment that will come to the master as the slave is their property
However this law is intended to provide the slave with some level of protection from physical abuse and murder
We see in the proverbs that
By words alone a slave cannot be corrected since he will understand but not respond
A man who pampers his slave from youth in the end he will be insolent
Proverbs 29 19 21
Beating one slave in the ancient Near East and in the Old Testament was certainly endorsed
As it was with beating one's child
What we see in Exodus 20 verses 20 to 21
Therefore is a law regulating the beating of one slave
The rationale of the law is likely focused on the intent of the master in the situation
If the master beat the slave so severely that the slave died immediately
Then there would be severe punishment likely death
However if the slave did not die immediately but survived for a day or two
Then according to this logic the intent of the master was likely not murderous
In other words if the slave did not die immediately then the benefit of the doubt would be given to the master
And the death would be seen as accidental
In verses 26 and 27 we read
While it is clear that these laws are in place to benefit and protect the slave
They are often misunderstood in their context in the preceding verses
The text is elaborating on the principle of Talion
Generally describing Lex Talionis or the law of retaliation
In verses 23 through 25 we see
Tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise
In this context we would expect that if a slave were on equal footing with the master before the law
We would read something akin to
An owner who hits his male or female slave in the eye and destroys it will have his own eye destroyed
This of course is not the case
The principle of retaliation that the slave would have the right to the eye of the master is not in play here
Thus the slave is protected by the law at least in theory from abuse or excessive beatings
If they are killed as a direct result of a beating it is considered murder and the master is likely to be killed
If the master destroys or puts out an eye or tooth the slave is forgiven their debt and set free
Deuteronomy 15
While we won't read through all the laws concerning slaves in Deuteronomy 15
We see many similarities between this passage and what we saw in Exodus 21
The text speaks of Hebrew slaves who served for six years and are released in the seventh
The slave is also able to voluntarily serve for life and a similar ritual is performed on that occasion
There are however differences between these passages
The laws in Deuteronomy pertain not only to the Hebrew man but also to the Hebrew woman
In this passage the woman is also to be released or is allowed to remain a slave for life
More significantly is the command for the master to provide a substantial amount of goods to the newly freed slave
The overall tone of the passage is one of encouraging the master not to hold back from his slave
As God has supernaturally blessed and provided for his people he will continue to do so if they keep his covenant
In like manner the master should also give generously to the slave
This concept of supernatural provision for obedience is seen prominently in Deuteronomy 28
And will be a central theme in the next chapter that we will analyze in the infamous Leviticus 25
Leviticus 25 is likely familiar to most atheist and apologist who debate the issue of slavery
Though probably to a very limited degree
These verses are incredibly significant to the slavery discussion
However before we investigate what they mean it is important to establish the context in which they exist
Let's begin with Leviticus 25 as a whole
The beginning of the chapter contains God's command to let the land of Israel have a year-long rest from farming every seventh year
The next section commands the people to also hold a year of rest every fiftieth year
They were to have seven Sabbath years totaling 49 years following Jubilee in the fiftieth year
During this year of the Jubilee people were to be returned to their land and debts were to be cancelled
This applied to the Israelites following verses 18-22
Which describe God's super national provision if they would obey his commands
We come to the critical section of the chapter for our purposes
Laws concerning Israelites that become poor
There are three scenarios that are discussed in these verses with respect to an Israelite
In the first because Israelites own property in the land of Israel
If they fell into poverty selling a portion of their land was a viable option
The law required however that the land would eventually return to its original owner
Either by a near relative redeeming it for them or during the year of Jubilee
In the second scenario it appears that the Israelite has already sold his property and still cannot make ends meet
Should this occur the poor Israelite was to be cared for by their fellow Israelites
Who were to loan them what they needed at no interest
They were to fear and obey God by supporting their poor brother
With the result that God would supernaturally provide for them because of their obedience
In the third scenario the Israelite actually reaches the stage where he must sell himself into debt slavery
However they are not to be treated as slaves
In contrast to Exodus 21 and Deuteronomy 15
Where it was perfectly legitimate to keep an Israelite as a slave
No longer allowed in Leviticus 25
If Israelites can no longer purchase fellow Israelites as slaves
A natural question arises in this context
Where should they get slaves?
We get our answer in the verses that follow
Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you
From them you may buy slaves
You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you
And members of their clan born in your country
And they will become your property
You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property
And can make them slaves for life
But you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly
Leviticus 25, 44 through 46
Amongst other things we learn from these verses that
One, chattel slaves can be purchased from the foreigners living in the nations around Israel
And from foreign tenant farmers living in Israel
Two, these slaves become their property
Three, their property can be passed on as an inheritance to their children
Four, they can be made to serve as slaves for life
In short, the Israelites were given special treatment as God's slaves
Because they already had a master, God himself
They could not be treated as slaves by another master
Instead, they were to be treated as hired workers
Whether under the control of an Israelite or foreign master
In contrast to this, foreign slaves were able to be purchased
Kept as property, passed on as inheritance and made to serve for life
New Testament
While theological interpretations are not the focus of my investigation into the Hebrew Bible
I have found that addressing certain arguments made by apologists can open up the dialogue in a meaningful way
In light of this, I would like to address an interpretation that
While certainly not new, has resurfaced with some frequency
This apologetic argument admits that the Old Testament endorsed slavery
However, it argues that this was God's way of slowly developing the morality of humanity
Beginning with his chosen people
In other words, God allowed slavery in the Old Testament
But was all the while slowly working to reveal to humanity that it was immoral in the Bible as a whole
There are a few pieces of evidence that are cited in this regard
The first, and certainly foremost, is Matthew 19.3-9
Where Jesus was tested on the subject of divorce
We don't need to go into great detail in this passage
As the basic principle that is used to support the argument is relatively clear
Jesus is confronted with a portion of the Mosaic Law
Deuteronomy 24.1-4
Which seems to contradict what Jesus had just taught
Jesus responded that Moses had legally permitted men to divorce their wives because their hearts were hard
In Matthew 19.8
This was not God's intent from the beginning
In other words, in the beginning, God created man and woman to be united for all time
He later allowed for divorce because of the sinfulness of mankind
This passage is then abstracted and applied to slavery
Another situation, it is argued that Jesus, and the New Testament, was attempting to bring humanity out of
While slavery is not mentioned in the text, the principle of returning to creation can be similarly applied
Immediately following creation before the fall, people were not enslaved to one another, but rather lived with one another with equality
It was only later, when mankind became sinful and wicked, that God had to regulate their behavior and an attempt to bring them back to the pristine state of creation
In order to effectively demonstrate that Jesus intended to bring about the abolishment of slavery, or even to draw attention to its immoral character
It would seem likely that two things would need to be present in the text or in history
First, Jesus and other New Testament authors would have condemned the practice in some overt way
And second, the early church would have recognized such condemnation
Is this what we see? In order to demonstrate that Jesus and the writers of the New Testament spoke out against or condemned slavery
There are several common passages that are cited by apologists setting aside general statements about loving one another
Paul's letter to Philemon often appears early in the conversation
Here, it is argued the apostle implores Philemon to free his slave Onissimus upon his return
Although the meaning of the book is debated, assuming the interpretation most in favor of an anti-slavery position by the apostle
Onissimus would indeed have been a slave of Philemon, whom Paul was seeking to have freed
Another text that is frequently cited comes from the so-called pastoral epistles
In 1 Timothy 1 9-10, the writer is speaking on the purpose of the law, listing those for whom it was made
We also know that the law is made not for the righteous, but for lawbreakers and rebels
The ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious
For those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for the sexually immoral
For those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars, and perjurers
And for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine
In verse 10, the inclusion of slave traders in a list of immoral practices is used to support the New Testament's anti-slavery position
The next verse that is cited in this regard is Galatians 3 28 where Paul writes
There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female
For you are all one in Christ Jesus
New Testament scholar Hans Dieter Betz summarizes the two ways in which this verse can be understood with respect to slavery
Taken alone, the statement can be understood in two ways
As a declaration of the abolishment of the social institution of slavery
Or as a declaration of the irrelevancy of that institution, which would indicate the possibility of its retainment
If the former position is taken, then one could argue that Jesus came to do away with the social institution of slavery
Let's begin with Galatians 3 28
We remember that there are two ways of interpreting the phrase neither slave nor free
Number one is abolishing the institution of slavery
Or number two, showing it to be irrelevant
Betz notes
The overwhelming evidence in early and later Christianity seems to recommend only the second option viable
A view taken by most commentators
That the passage is not intended to do away with the social institution of slavery is clear for several reasons
First, the other two statements in the verse, neither Jew nor Gentile and especially neither male nor female
Can hardly be understood as doing away with such distinctions
Whatever one would argue concerning the attitude of the New Testament writers on the role of status of women
Another topic entirely
It would be difficult to maintain that passages like 1 Corinthians 1434-35 would allow the social distinction between men and women to be ignored
The point of Galatians 3 28 it would seem is to express the unity that members of the body of Christ share by being in Christ
New Testament scholar Scott McKnight writes
To be in Christ is to be in spiritual fellowship with him through God's spirit
This is one way of defining what a Christian is, one who is in Christ
Although believers are now all united and equal in the eyes of God having been baptized into Christ
This does not negate the reality of social and role distinctions between members of the referenced social groups including slaves
Ancient Near Eastern scholar Hector Avalos concludes
Galatians 3 28 was clearly meant solely to establish the reckoning of believers as Abraham seat
Regardless of their gender, ethnicity or slave status
Other New Testament authors certainly did not see this passage as incompatible with having Christian slaves
Or ordering Christian slaves to serve their slave masters
Ephesians 5 24 or 6 5
When we consider 1 Timothy 110 where slave traders are included in the list of vices
It may seem straightforward that this shows that the writer condemned slavery, this is simply not the case
Concerning these slave traders, professor of religious studies J. Albert Harrell describes them in this way
Slave dealers displayed vice at every stage of the slave trading operation from the illegitimate acquisition
And the deceptive selling of merchandise to the polluting result such sale had on places and people
In acquiring merchandise when legitimate sources such as war captives did not offer enough supply
They were not above kidnapping free citizens, a criminal act against the law of nations
In fact, this word for slave trader appears in other so-called vice lists outside of the New Testament
Clearly demonstrating that the act of stealing or illegally procuring another individual was not only considered immoral in the New and Old Testaments
But also among the other nations
Avalos notes
The fact that slave societies of Greece and Rome condemned in Andropodistase indicates that pure slave trading cannot be meant
And Harrell concurs
Rather than revealing some alleged early Christian condemnation of slavery or the slave trade
The language of 1st Timothy articulates attitudes commonplace among masters in the Roman Empire
The term Andropodistai was derogatory only in the sense of the slaveholders' exploitation, economic and sexual, of free citizens
And of their proverbial abuse of the law
The ancient world believed in the moral goodness of slavery, yet condemned the immorality of slave traders
Finally, let's examine the book of Philemon
As we discussed before, apologist often turned to Philemon as a perhaps subtle statement on the position of Christianity on slavery
However, one understands the situation being described in the book
We would be hard pressed to see it as presenting an overarching declaration on the institution of slavery
New Testament scholar Edward Los writes concerning this view
For good reasons, this view has found no acceptance and today is no longer held by anyone
The letter to Philemon is neither the disguise of a general idea nor the promulgation of a generally valid rule about the question of slavery
Assuming that a slave-master relationship existed between Philemon and Anissimus
It seems clear that Paul leaves the decision to free Anissimus to Philemon
In verses 8-9, for example, Paul writes
Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do
Yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love
Los comments
It is the intercession of the apostle in a concrete situation in which love, agape, must be promoted by decision and deed
This lack of direct command based on the immoral character of the active enslavement is indeed problematic in the context
In other words, if we were to see a passage like 1 Timothy 1-10 as a direct indictment against the practice of slavery
It is incredibly difficult to imagine a scenario in which Paul would say
I'm leaving this up to you, I don't want to force you to set him free
Hector Avalos says it this way
Nowhere in the letter do we see Paul saying, slavery is a sin and you must free Anissimus
Nowhere in the letter do we have anything even akin to the strong directive issued by Paul on such things as drunkenness and adultery
1 Corinthians 6, 8-9, incest, 1 Corinthians 5, or just not working hard enough
2 Thessalonians 2-10
At best it would seem the book of Philemon is evidence of Paul encouraging Philemon to forgive and free his runaway slave in order that Anissimus might return to Paul to help him in the ministry
In no way is this a broad directive against owning other human beings as slaves
Antebellum South
At this point you might be thinking, okay, so the Old Testament laws seem to have endorsed slavery
And the New Testament did not seem to condemn the practice, but it still wasn't like slavery in the American South
The problem with this type of comparison is that it is generally made between the laws of the Old Testament and what actually took place in the Antebellum South
There's usually not a comparison made between the laws in the Old Testament and the laws in the American South
When we view the laws in the South, we actually find that there are many similarities between the two sets of laws
Let's take a look at two examples of laws from the Antebellum South to see how they compare to those in the Old Testament
Again, for a much more detailed discussion with this issue, see Dr. Joshua Bowen's book, Did the Old Testament Endure Slavery, 2nd Edition
We will jump to the period leading up to the Civil War. There was a significant development, relatively speaking, in the humanity of the legal system after the Revolutionary War
First, the African slave trade was ended by the beginning of the 19th century
While it was not illegal to have slaves, it was illegal to import them via the slave trade
The process was begun during the war by imposing heavy taxes on the purchase of slaves from Africa
Finkelman notes that South Carolina sought to re-establish the African slave trade. This was shortly ended
The treatment of slaves was also improved throughout the South during this period
Law professor Paul Finkelman writes
In most of the post-revolutionary South, the laws became more humane as Southern states prohibited their more barbaric punishments, such as dismemberment
North Carolina criminalized the murder of a slave in 1791, but South Carolina did not do so until 1821
Most other slave states adopted similar rules, either by statute or through common law decisions in the antebellum period
For example, in Georgia's Constitution in 1798, section 12, we read
Any person who shall maliciously dismember or deprive a slave of life shall suffer such punishment as would be inflicted in case the like offense had been committed on a free white person
And on the like proof, except in case of insurrection by such slave, and unless such death should happen by accident in giving such slave moderate correction
Thus, if it was determined that a slave master had abused their slave to the point of dismemberment or death, the penalty would be equal to the penalty for murdering a free white person
Nevertheless, let's not forget the end of the law
Unless such death should happen by accident in giving such slave moderate correction
The tension remained in the eyes of the lawmakers
Masters must be allowed to beat their slaves for the purposes of correction
However far the law was progressing in an attempt to protect slaves from abuse, it seemed always run up against the problem of corporal punishment for correction
A similar law was adopted in North Carolina in 1791, outlawing the deliberate homicide of a slave
The earlier law of 1774 had made it so that
The killing of a slave however wanton, cruel and deliberate is only punishable in the first instance by imprisonment and paying the value thereof to the owner
However, this act sought to rectify what was considered highly inappropriate
Which distinction of criminality between the murder of a white person and of one who is equally a human creature but merely of a different complexion
Is disgraceful to humanity and degrading in the highest degree to the laws and principles of a free, Christian and enlightened country
Be it enacted that if any person shall hereafter be guilty of woefully and maliciously killing a slave
Such offender shall upon the first conviction thereof be a judged guilty of murder and shall suffer the same punishment as if he had killed a free man
Any law, usage or custom to the contrary, notwithstanding
The language in the law is noteworthy, referring to the humanity of the slave
The difference only in his complexion and the fact that this was disgraceful to a Christian country all led to the enactment of a law that forbid murdering a slave
The punishment of which would be equal to that of killing a free person
While on paper, the rationale may have been motivated by care and humanization, there may have been other motivating factors
The new laws, such as North Carolina's Act of 1791 making murder of a slave a felony in part reflected some of the liberal thought of the revolution
The closing of the African slave trade by the states during the revolution also helped reduce inhumane treatment because slaves who died from punishment or maltreatment could no longer be easily and cheaply replaced
And of course, we cannot forget how the law ends
Provided always that this act shall not extend to the person killing a slave outlawed by virtue of any act of assembly of the state or to any slave in the act of resistance to his lawful owner or master or to any slave dying under moderate correction
In short, in the antebellum South where slavery flourished, we see that laws were set in place in an apparent attempt to curb the abuse of slaves
As we have seen in the legal sections of the Old Testament, the laws that govern slavery often struggled with the same tensions that were felt in the South and regulated the practice often in a similar way
To come home
Conclusion
There are several things that we can conclude from all of this
First, the Old Testament laws definitely endorsed the social institution of slavery, owning other people as property
And this was not a nice form of slavery
People were owned as property and could be passed on as an inheritance
We looked into the three primary sections of the law in Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus
To see what the Bible actually says about owning people as slaves
We then went to the New Testament to see if slavery was condemned by Jesus or the writers of the New Testament books
It was not
Finally, we looked at some of the similarities between the laws governing slavery in the antebellum South and how they were not so dissimilar from those in the Bible
The topic of slavery is one that makes us uncomfortable, and yet it comes up time and again in discussions about morality and the God of the Bible
We would do well whether as a believer or atheist to understand what the Bible actually says about the practice of slavery
Rather than building our conclusions and positions on faulty arguments or apologetics
Slavery was indeed endorsed in the Old Testament and the New Testament did not condemn its practice
While we did not have the time to cover the topic in great detail in this video
Dr. Joshua Bowen spends nearly 700 pages going through all of the laws in the ancient Near East
Including the Old Testament describing the practice of slavery and how we should understand its practice in the Old Testament
He also goes into more detail about the New Testament, early Christianity, and the American South
As we conclude, I would like to re-emphasize how the Old Testament laws concerning slavery were not so different from those in the antebellum South
This should give us pause
We must remember the atrocities that transpired prior to the Civil War
And vigilante guard against repeating the past by understanding the nature of slavery
Not only in the South, but in the laws of the Old Testament
In several places in the world, even today, slavery in some shape or form is still being practiced
And I'd love to see a world where it's completely abolished and no longer practiced
