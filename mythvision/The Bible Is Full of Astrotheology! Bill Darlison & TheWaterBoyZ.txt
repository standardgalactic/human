There is truth to stickers
Right hands on the wall
There is truth to stickers
Letters are too small
Thirteen months old baby
Drop the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
With the things in your back
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
And you suffer
Just tell everybody
Yeah
Letters are too small
Welcome to the water boys
With Derek Lambert
It seems to me tonight
The stars are lining up
And we have obviously
Your truly doctor
Luther G. Williams
How you doing doctor?
I'm doing wonderful Derek
And I'm so excited about tonight's show
Our guest is a favorite of mine
And I can't wait to say
Wonderful things about him
Absolutely I totally agree with you
It is late where he lives
I'm not going to tell his name
I'm going to let you tell it Luther
But it is extremely late
So he is coming out on a limb for us
And I really appreciate that
Because I think we're going to hear
Some extremely exciting
Educational and probably
External concepts that we find
In the New Testament
With this gentleman
So go ahead Luther if you don't mind
Take the honors and introduce them
No question Derek
It's extremely late across the pond
But as they say
Joining us is Bill Darlison
Who before his retirement
In 2010 was the senior minister
Of the Dublin Unitarian Church
He served as president
Of the General Assembly of Unitarian
Free Christian churches in Britain and Ireland
Bill has written for
A host of publications including
The Inquirer, The Unitarian
The Astrological Journal
The Furrow
The Irish Times
And The Gnostic
He's the author of a book entitled
The Gospel and the Zodiac
The Secret Truth About Jesus
Published in 2007
And translated into the German
And Czech languages
And the Outer Print
But it can be downloaded free
Online and you can find that
On our Water Boys Podcast
Group website on Facebook
He's also written
The Celestial Journey of the Soul
Which is available from Amazon
And it covers much the same ground
As the Gospel and the Zodiac
But in a more accessible form
Bill blogs occasionally
Giving forth uplifting words
At billdarlison.blogspot.com
And
That also will be listed
On our podcast group site
Bill can be contacted via email
At billdarlison
That's D-A-R-L-I-S-O-N
At hotmail.com
His latest work concerns
Astrophiology in the book of
Exodus
Bill enjoys retirement in England
With his lovely wife, Morag
And if she's not too angry with us
For talking so late
With him, we're delighted
To have him on the show
Bill, we're so happy to have you with us
Thank you, Luther
Good to be there
And even though it's late
I still feel relatively alert
Wonderful
Wonderful
Bill, you know, you
Have been familiar with the Bible
From your upbringing
As a Catholic
And then through your religious
Training and studying to be a priest
At what point did you
At what point did you come to realize
That something besides
History was going on
In the Bible?
That's a very good question actually, Luther
I think probably
I've been aware of it
In a kind of subliminal way
From the earliest times
You know, when you start
To read the Bible and you
Realize that
If these things are history
They're very strange kinds of history
And so
I always had the feeling
That there was something else
But I didn't quite know
What that something else was
And when I left the seminary
I was never ordained a Catholic priest
I went back into teaching
And I was teaching English literature
And also Bible
I was teaching
At a Catholic school in England
Where that sort of thing is
Possible, I know that it wouldn't happen
In a
Public school in America
But it certainly
Happens here and we had the
I was teaching
16, 17, 18 year olds
Who were pre-university students
And I was teaching them the New Testament
And so
For 12 years I did this
And I
I used to look
At the Gospel of Mark
And of course there's a strange
Passage in the Gospel of Mark
And in chapter 14
Where Jesus sends the
Apostles into the city
And tells them that there they will
See a man carrying a jar of water
And there to go to him
And he'll show them a room
Where they are to prepare the Passover
Now I always
I realized at the time
That I was teaching this
This is the figure of Aquarius
The man carrying a jar of water
But I couldn't really fit it in
I didn't know how it fitted
Into the whole Zodiacal scheme
And why it should appear
In this specific place
And I'd studied astrology
Quite extensively
I began my study of astrology
In 1966
And so
I was really very familiar
With the astrological images
And then one day
This was in 1989
And I remember it so vividly
It was a hot
Summer afternoon
And I was invigilating an examination
It was a Spanish examination
And there were about four
Students
In the class
All working away
They were simply supervising
Their activities
And there was a Bible on the desk
In front of me
And for some reason
I was just prompted
To look at the Gospel of Mark
I shouldn't have done it, of course
I should have kept my eyes on the students
But something motivated me
And I looked at this passage
In chapter 14
Going to the city
And there you'll find a man carrying a jar of water
And I thought, well this is definitely
Aquarius
And what surrounds that
Is of course the
Chapter 13
Where you have Jesus talking about
The end of the age
And the breakdown of the structures
That we'd all been familiar
With in society
And the destruction of the temple
And that too is Aquarian
You know, the idea of Aquarius
Is the rebel and the one
Who transforms and changes
So here was Aquarius
A whole section kind of
Looking very Aquarian
And then of course
What follows is the death
Or the trial and death of Jesus
With all the kind of Piscian
Qualities to it, like betrayal
Drugs, you know
Jesus has offered drugs
While he's on the cross
And these are
These have got a Piscian quality
Denial
Of Peter
The ancient world didn't like Pisces
You know, they had
An abhorrence of fish in
So many ways
And so many of these
And dreams of course
But not in Mark
The dream of Pilate
That appears in Matthew
But that's the kind of Piscian
That's the ultimate
So I thought, well right at the end
Of the Gospel we have Pisces
And then a couple of chapters back
We have Aquarius
So if we work backwards
And then I suddenly saw it
I realized
Go back
And you have the whole section
In which Jesus deals with
Authority
Which is Capricornian
And then go back a bit more
Riding into Jerusalem
Now of course we all think
He rides into Jerusalem
On a donkey
Isn't that what everybody thinks?
Isn't that what you think?
This is the image that we all have
Look at the Mark and Tim
He doesn't ride into Jerusalem
On a donkey
Mark uses the word Polos
The Greek word Polos
And this means
A young horse
He rides into Jerusalem
On a young horse
Now here, for those with a little bit
Of imagination and a little bit
Of understanding of astrology
Will recognize the figure
Of the centaur
Which of course is Sagittarius
Do you see how I'm working
Backwards now here
And not only that
Not only is it
A horse
Look at the text once more
A horse on which no one
Has ever sat
Now a horse on which
No one has ever sat
Is not a nice, easy
Donkey
It is a wild beast
You see
It's an unbroken horse
And yet Jesus rides
Sedately into Jerusalem
On an unbroken horse
So here is a picture
Of Sagittarius
Occurring
Precisely where it should
And there are other elements around that
Which we'll go into later
If you want to
Which also indicates Sagittarius
And then go back
And Jesus is in Jericho
Now this is
Jericho is the lowest
Inhabited place on earth
Now if you know anything
About astrology
And Scorpio
You know that Scorpio deals with
The depths of things
And
It's in this very spot
Where James and John ask Jesus
For power in the kingdom
They want to sit at his right hand
And his left
When he comes into his kingdom
This is an absolutely
Scorpionic question
And then we go back
Further and it's Libra
Where Jesus gives his
Instructions on marriage
Libra concerns
Marriage
And then a little earlier
We have his teaching
On humility which is
Vergon
So I'm working through this
While this examination is going on
And I realize
The whole of the zodiac
Is here for those who
Have eyes to see
They're not all as clear
And carrying a jar of water
But they're there
Not as the pictograms
Of the zodiacal signs
But what the zodiacal signs
Mean
Intrinsically what they're
What they symbolize
And so I worked all the way through
Right through to Aries
Which of course
Aries concerned beginnings
Because this is when the year begins
At the spring equinox
And the very first word of the
Gospel of Mark is
Beginning
Not even
There's not even an article
Before the word
It doesn't say the beginning
Although this is always
Translated as the beginning
But the very first word of the
Gospel of Mark is beginning
And so
Having
Realized this
That all 12 signs were there
In perfect order
I was almost like shouting
Eureka while these poor kids
Were struggling with their Spanish examination
And
And subsequently then
I stopped teaching
1989 and my wife and I
Went to live in America
For three years
My wife's a nurse
And she was what they call a flight nurse
Which was they simply
Go where they're required and we spent
A year in San Francisco
And then about 8 months
In New Orleans and about
18 months in San Antonio
And in that time
I was able to hone
This theory
And to find out
Lots more about
These
Individual sections of the
Gospel And how these
Relate to each other
And how they relate to the other
Synoptic Gospels
Matthew and Luke
So that's how I came
To realize and then of course
Having made this
Realization
I could no longer
Entertain the idea
That what we have in the
Gospel of Mark
Is a history of the
Man Jesus Christ
You know that
It's ludicrous to think
That
A rudimentary
Biography Which is what many people
Think Mark's Gospel is
A rudimentary
Biography of Jesus
Should start
When he's 30 years old
And that it should only
Last you know the whole of the saga
Last for one year in Mark's
Gospel
In John it's probably
Over three years The public ministry
Of Jesus But in Mark
It's just one year
And of course it is
The zodiacal year in my view
And so how can we
That what we're dealing with here
Is history When it's written
In this
Rather curious way
Curious to
Our way of understanding
Things
Indeed
That's taken a long time
So answer your question Luther
But I am now at the point
Where I can no longer believe
That what we're dealing
With is history
And so I am
To that extent a mythicist
Well you've done a good job
Of walking us through the process
Derek are you still with us
I want to make sure nothing happened
To your microphone You were kind of drifting
In and out
Derek I'm having trouble
Hearing you consistently
How about Bill
Bill can you hear Derek consistently
No I can hear you Luther
But I can't hear Derek
Maybe he's falling asleep
Listening to me
No not at all
I think we're having technical difficulty
I think we're having technical difficulty
With Derek's mic
So as we
To correct the problem Bill
Let me go on and have you
Proceed to the next question if we may
So obviously
There are some problems
And contradictions that naturally arise
For anybody
Who regards the gospels
As history and you talk about a few
Of those in your book Maybe you could
Summarize just a few of them
The things about which we might be
On guard about considering the gospel
As history
Yes I think
One of the things that I discovered
When I was researching these things
Was something that
Origin had said
Origin the
Third century
Church father
Who said that
The bible is full of contradictions
And anomalies and
Strange
Historical
Historical facts
And they're there
For a reason
They're there because
It alerts the reader
To the fact that it is not
History that they're reading
You know what I mean
That the
Example he gives is the very first
Chapter of Genesis
Where God creates
Light
The very first thing God creates is light
But the sun
Doesn't appear until day four
Now how has that occurred
How can there be light
Without the sun
Now Origin says
This anomalous
Fact
Is given here
So that we won't think
We're dealing with
Physical light
That we have to look
Into the text
In a different way
Than what it's really saying
And so the ludicrous
Nature of the narrative
Is a clue to us
To stop looking at it
In a purely logical way
And I think
The same thing applies with the gospels
You know I could
If somebody said to me
Take a week off bill
And iron out all the inconsistencies
In the gospels
I could do it maybe in two days
Now why didn't the early
Writers
The early compilers of the bible books
Why didn't they do that
Why did they say
For instance
Why did they allow the bible to contain
Something like this
That Mark says
That Jesus met
One demoniac
The garrison demoniac
Now Matthew says
He met two
Now surely
Some editor
Could have corrected that
He could have said
We don't want this to appear
In the text because people might think
There's something strange going on
So we'll either just have both say
That Jesus met two demoniacs
Or we'll say that he met one
But we won't leave it
So that one says one
And another says two
But they do leave that
Similarly the gospel of John
Says that the crucifixion of Jesus
Took place on the day
Of preparation for the Passover
The synoptic gospel
Say that it took place
On the day of the Passover
Now surely again
This could have been sorted out
But it isn't
Why not
You know these are very important questions
That we have to ask ourselves
And
So either we think
That the people who compiled the Bible
Were stupid
Neglectful
They didn't notice
What was there in front of their eyes
Or we say
That they had an agenda
Which we've lost
Which we have completely lost
Because for two thousand years
Or for fifteen hundred years
Or however many years
Christian scholars have spent their time
Trying to iron out these inconsistencies
Read the Jehovah's Witnesses
And they will tell you
There were two occasions
On which Jesus met a demoniac
Or met demoniac
On one occasion he met one demoniac
And on another occasion
He met two demoniacs
You see what I mean
They work it out
In that way
And
The whole
There are so many of these in the Gospel
As there are in the rest of the Bible
And
Until we stop looking at them
As historical
And try to
Try to perceive them
In a different way
We're just in the same loop
We've been going around in circles
For decades
For centuries
With these stories
Instead of really
Looking behind
And trying to find out
What is really being said
And the inconsistencies
And anomalies
And contradictions
Are there to encourage us to do that
Not to give us some things
To work out
So that we've got the whole thing
Nicely
Made plausible once more
It's not plausible as history
Wow, can you guys hear me?
Jesus being
I can hear you now
So this is
Self is ludicrous
You know the Romans were not idiots
You know
Jerusalem was so time of the past
Over everybody who could
Get to Jerusalem
Went to Jerusalem
All the Jews from all over the place
Now for the Romans to crucify
Even a pretender
For the Greek and Greek status
At that precise time
Would have been an act
Of sheer folly
And if they were
Whatever they were
The Romans were not stupid
So why do they say
All the Gospels
That it was around this time
When the high priests would have been busy
With the rest of the priests
Slaughtering the Passover lambs
Why do they say
With this pretender
To messianic status
You know and so
Again
When you see something as
Apparently ludicrous as that
You have to see
That the death of Jesus
And the Passover are linked
Symbolically
But the idea that they have a historical
Reality
Is beyond belief
Really
Wonderful
So what did I miss
What question do you get on Luther
Since we have this thing organized
And I lost my mic here
For internet connection
What questions did you get to brother
I got to
What you probably have as a third
Question Derek
Bill was talking about some of the
Problems and contradictions
That come from a historical interpretation
You didn't ask the second
To anything dealing with the
Historicity of Jesus by any chance
No
I didn't pointedly address
The historicity of Jesus
Let you do that
Right
I didn't want to go too deep into it
Because it really doesn't matter
In where we're headed with this
Because you know at the point
Where I'm at Bill
Whether he existed or is a
Device
Manufactured device purposely trying to
Give you some type of allegorical
Explanation or what not
To me at the end of the day
It doesn't harm
How I view things
But did this kind of red flag
Whether he was a real character
Who really did these things
That it's talking about for you
Pretty much what I'm saying is
What did it do in your view
Of the historicity of Jesus
And you know how did you
View a historical Christ
Because I know many you know
There's a mythicist these days
Who suggest he didn't exist possibly
They don't say for certain
Because nobody knows for certain
But what did it do in that
Did it touch anything in this field?
Yes I think one of the things
That was interesting to me
Was the film by Mel Gibson
Some years ago I don't know
Whether you saw it
It was an interesting film
It was all in Aramaic and Latin
The dialogue
And whenever Jesus
Was referred to he was given
His Hebrew name
Which of course is Joshua
And
So that whenever they referred
To this individual they called him
Yahoshua
And so we have to look at
Who Joshua
Is to get some understanding
Of who
The person who appears
In the New Testament is
Joshua in the Old Testament
Is the one
Who leads the people into the promised land
Moses doesn't
Moses gets there
To the edge
But he dies
Before the people can go in
And it's Joshua who takes them in
Now
You look at the Gospel
And you see
There's a contrast
Between two important characters
In the Gospel
What is John the Baptist
And John the Baptist
If you read the Gospels
Of Luke and Matthew
You see the kind of teaching
John the Baptist had
And he was the
Conventional guy who was
John the Baptist
He was a good liberal chap
He told people not to demand
His elders to behave themselves
And not to extort money out of people
He told people that if they had
Too much that they had to share with others
Now that's pretty good
Conventional talk
But
That doesn't lead you
Into the kingdom of God
Jesus is the one
Joshua is the one
Who leads you into the kingdom
This is the reason
Why the two of them are contrasted
Now they're contrasted
In the Gospel of John
John the Baptist
Says about Jesus
He must increase
And I must decrease
Do you know that bit?
Yes
Are you there?
Absolutely
This is a reference
In my view
This is a reference to
The solstices
Who is six months older than Jesus
You know this
From the synoptic Gospel
John the Baptist is six months
Older than Jesus
He
Represents
The Somersolstice
When is John the Baptist's day
In the Christian calendar
The 24th of June
The people who devised the
Christian calendar
Understood the zodiac pretty well
John the Baptist's day
Is the 24th of June
That is the time of
The Somersolstice
When the sun starts to weaken
And decline
Jesus is born
Six months later
At the time of the winter solstice
When the sun starts to grate
To gain in strength
So this
Contrast which is pointed out
Obliquely
In the Gospel of John
He must increase
While I must decrease
Is
A recognition
Of the role
The contrasting roles
Of these two men
John the Baptist is a Moses figure
He takes us so far
Jesus is
The saviour
The one who takes us into
The Promised Land
Using these kind of
This kind of understanding
Of the figures
As they appear
Which makes me realize that
Even though there may well have been
A person called Jesus
As there almost certainly
Was a person called John
The Baptist
They are nevertheless brought together
In this way to point a contrast
And so Jesus is
The Joshua figure
The one who leads us into
The
Into the land of promise
John the Baptist is the one
Who gets us to the edge
But no further
And because of that
I cannot really see
How
We are dealing with
A historical
A historical person
And of course all the rest of it
You know that
Birth from a virgin
You know I mean this
Again is
This used to disturb me when I was younger
How can somebody be born
Of a virgin but of course again
Astrologically
It all makes perfect sense
Bethlehem
Where Jesus is born
Is the house of bread
In Hebrew
Lechem
Means bread
The house of bread is Virgo
Virgo is the sign
Of the harvest
And the house of bread
Is Virgo
So Jesus is born
Born of
A virgin in that sense
Not in the actual biological sense
I don't really see
How there can be
Any history
In these kinds of
In these aspects of the story anyway
Can I
One thing Bill
That was extremely well said
And there's not much comment
That needs to be said about that
I know Luther you've got a question
You're definitely following through with
I do want to say
For the audience
In what we're going to listen to
This examination in the text
You've got to get this book
That's the goal so get the book
You'll be able to actually see this stuff
And I'm not going
To open up the canner worms of the new one
That's coming but just be on your tippy toes
And get ready because
Obviously you'd have more
On how you're going to show this stuff
But Luther did you want to jump into the next question
Brother?
I'll do it Derek and of course
You'll be ready with a brief
Outline to take us through
The wonderful things that are in the book
I know you want to talk about that
But before we do Bill
So you're making these discoveries
Or rediscoveries as the case may be
And
At some point you decide
That the information has come
Into pretty clear focus
And I'm now ready to publish
When did you
Feel that
That you had the information pretty much
Well in hand that it was time to
Make a wonderful statement that is your book
I started looking around
For a publisher in the early
Part of this
Of this century really
Maybe even the later
The latter part of the
Of the last one
But of course
Finding publishers is not
An easy thing to do as I'm sure
You're aware
And it was one of those quite
Fortuitous
Accidents really
That I happened
To be on holiday in Rome
And that happened
I was with my wife and
A few friends
And these
Two friends had
Rented
A big house
In Rome
So invited another couple
So there were these two men
My wife
And myself and
Another couple and
The man of this couple
Just happened to be
Working for Duckworth publisher
And this was in
2006
And we got
Talking late at night and I was
Putting these theories to him
And he said I'll publish the book
And he did
And you know that's how
It came about but looking
For publishers before that
Was very hard
And you know because they're not
Really that interested
In these things
Well
And so
I gave talks on it and people
Were interested
But there was nobody
Really
In taking it up and publishing it
Because
It runs counter
To traditional Christian teaching
So to find a
Traditional Christian publisher
Would have been impossible
But it's also not really
Astrological enough
For the astrological community
You know, he said it's strange
Astrologists are not really
That interested in the Bible
And Bible scholars are not that interested
In astrology
And so find yourself
A difficult situation
When it comes to these things
Right
So the book was published
Because of that
Accidental encounter
That I had in Rome
But now
The man who published it
The man called Nick Webb
A beautiful human being
As soon as he died
And no longer works for Duckworth
And so
I can't call upon his services
For any future
Any future works that I might have
I see
So that's the
That's how the book came about
But what I
One of the interesting things about it
Was that I found
As I was researching it
There were certain things
That seemed to me to be
Out of place
And so I thought to myself
When I was telling you earlier
About going through
When I was supervising the Spanish exam
And how
I was finding
The perfect sequence all the way through
There were certain things
Which didn't seem to fit
And I thought that maybe
These were interpolations
That were added later
But the more I looked
Into it
The more I realized
That the things that didn't seem to fit
Fit very well indeed
I'll give you an example
The calming of the storm
Which appears
I think it's in chapter four
Of Mark
Yes
How is this Germanian
You know, it doesn't fit with Taurus
How is it Germanian?
But it wasn't until
I really looked at
The mythology of Gemini
That I realized
That it's precisely where it should be
Because Gemini
The twins, Castor and Pollux
The twin stars of Gemini
Were considered to be
The guardians of sailors
In the ancient Greek world
And there's a hymn
Which is attributed to Homer
He certainly wasn't
Written by Homer
Which talks about
When sailors are in distress
They pray
To the heavenly twins
Castor and Pollux
And they're brought safely to shore
Now, this is
Precisely
It is Germanian then
That when Jesus
Is with the apostles on the sea
And they're in distress
They call upon him
And so we have
A reworking
Of the Gemini myth
From Greek mythology
Precisely at the beginning
Of the Gemini section
Of the Gospel of Mark
So it wasn't until
Some time after
I devised the theory
That I realized
That the things which seem to be anomalous
Were not that they were
Precisely where they should be
Now that's interesting
So did you continue to make discoveries
In the book of Mark after you published?
Or maybe are you still making
Discoveries in that
I made a discovery last year
And it was
It was really quite remarkable
When I was putting together the
Celestial Journey of the Soul
Which is a series of
27 sermons that I gave
In Dublin
In the Unitarian Church there
Over a period of one year
I started in April
And I looked at the first chapters
Of Mark and how they
Relate to
Sorry, in March
How they relate to Aries
And then I did two sermons
On each of the Zodiac signs
All the way through the year
And I put these together into
A book
Called The Celestial Journey of the Soul
But before that
Book was published
I
And I was able to incorporate it
I came across this most
Remarkable
Passage
Which again
Kind of
Shows that the
Theory has got substance
You know that
When Jesus
Is the Syrophoenician
Woman
This is in what I call the
Canceran section
Of the Gospel Mark
And she asks him to cure
Her daughter
And Jesus says
It is not right for me to give
The children's food to the dogs
And she
I'm
Just trying to find
The actual passage
To be here
And
She
Says to him
Ah yes, but even the dogs
Will eat the children's
Scraps that fall from the table
Now this is a
Pretty arresting image
And because of this image
Because of this
Statement
Jesus says your daughter is cured
Now I'm reading a book
I was reading a book called
Patterns in the Sky
By a man called Julius the Starr
Julius D. W. Starr
And he says
This is what he writes
And I put this in as a footnote in the book
Above Prochion
Are the stars of Castor and Pollux
The twins
Nearly a perfect rectangle
Sometimes this rectangle
Is seen as a table
Castor and Pollux are cheating
The two dogs, Sirius
And Prochion
Are waiting patiently
For the table crumbs
These crumbs can be seen as
Very faint stars of magnitude
Five or six scattered
Between Gemini and Prochion
Now
It seems to me
That we have in this image
Of the crumbs falling
From the table
Image
In precisely
The place that it should be
That is between Gemini
And Cancer
And so here again
This was startling confirmation to me
That
My theory is correct
Because
It's not just
That image is not
Something which may or may not fit
It's the exact image
That it appears that the Gospel writer
Was using
In the precise place
Where it should be
To reflect the pattern of the stars
So
I discovered this bit only last year
No idea
That there was any indication
That there was any idea
In the ancient world
That these stars
Between the two dog stars
Prochion and Sirius
That they were
Alikened to dogs waiting
For crumbs to fall from the table
And yet that's precisely the image
That we have in the Gospel
You always seem funny Bill
I'm sorry
No it's okay
I suppose if I was to
Go into things in more detail
I'd find even more things
But my life has moved on
You know
That's kind of the point
I think that's the point though
Is you wouldn't
Read that statement
And just suppose that that's a normal statement
Like oh okay
Let's just keep going
It takes like you said
And I like to use the analogy
That everybody's wearing a certain pair of glasses
Some are wearing
A historical pair of glasses
Some are
Anti-biblical pair of glasses
Some are
Everybody's got a pair of glasses
And if you're able to see this
It is beautiful
It really is
It's kind of like those
They have scientifically shown
You know ways of making
Glasses or shades
For colorblind men
I always watch those little videos
I'm on Facebook all the time
And it'll show a man who's never seen
Real colors if you will
Of the world
He buys him a pair of glasses
And all of a sudden when he sees it
And you see his face and how he reacts
Usually he sees in tears
Or she's in tears
And so it's that beautiful to me
To find this stuff
It's done wonders in my research
But let's talk about the layout
Of the book
12 chapters
One on each sign
Then an appendix with your translation
Of the entire gospel
Appendix 2 is supplementary material
On planetary rulers
Medical astrology
And the three lesser constellations
Associated with each sign
Do you want to elaborate on some of that
Maybe?
Yeah, I think
One of the things that I found
Difficult
Really in the beginning
Was the way in which
There are definitely 12 sections
And they definitely reflect the zodiac
But they're of different sizes
You know, for instance
The Aerie section is three chapters
Whereas the Virgo section
Is just a few verses
And the Scorpio section
Similarly just a few verses
And so I've really
Had to struggle with this
But of course
I think that possibly
And that
This is something that perhaps other
People will work on in the future
I certainly hope they will
Possibly
The original gospel
Had longer sections
And that
I'll give you an example
You know the
Theory that
That a bit of Mark was left out
And it was found by Morton Smith
In a monastery
At Marsaba
It's called The Secret Gospel of Mark
Are you familiar with this theory?
I've heard of that
Yeah, well
I haven't
Well
Morton Smith was a biblical scholar
And I don't know the details
Precisely but they are in the book
They're delineated there
But
He was in a monastery
In Marsaba
In Jerusalem
He came across
Somebody's written out
A bit from the Gospel of Mark
Which is not in canonical Mark
And
It describes Jesus
Meeting a man
And them spending the night together
And
Jesus teaching him
The secrets of the kingdom
Now there's a hint of sex here
But it's not
It's not specific
But it's quite a lengthy section
Now the important thing is
That the person who'd written this
That Morton Smith discovered
Actually gives its location
In
Canonical Mark
It says this occurs just after
James and John asked Jesus
To
For power in his kingdom
Now that means
It's in the Scorpio section
And the Scorpio section
In the Canonical Mark
Is very short
But if you add this bit to it
Which Morton Smith
Discovered
Then
It's much longer
It gives it a much more
Significant presence in the Gospel text
And so since the themes
Of this Morton Smith discovery
Are Scorpionic
And they appear precisely
In the Scorpio section
Then it could well be
That the other sections
Which are relatively short
Could also
Have been extended
In an original document
Which we no longer possess
You see what I mean
So
Those are
Some possible things
That could be worked on
In the future
I don't know how
I don't know whether
We will ever find
Documents which precede the Gospels
As we have them
The other thing
About
The constellations
Which surround the Zodiac
You see again these are very interesting
And these appear
In the Gospel text
As well, you have to look for them
And you have to
Be open
To the curious way
In which they're woven
Into the text
For incidents
The curing of Peter's mother-in-law
Which appears in the Ares
Section
Of the Gospel
It's right at the very beginning
I don't know the exact verse
In Chapter 1 or 2
Of Mark
Now
Peter's mother-in-law
Is said to be reclining
With a fever
And Jesus
Goes with Peter
And he cures this lady
And she gets up
And takes on them
Says the story
Now if you know your Greek mythology
You know there is
A woman
Called the reclining woman
And there is a constellation
Called the reclining woman
And it's Cassiopeia
Cassiopeia appears
Around
It's in the same part of the sky
I love it
Now Cassiopeia
Was
The mother
Of Andromeda
Now what do you know anything
Do you remember anything about Andromeda?
Andromeda was chained
To the rock
And she's rescued by Perseus
Ah
And now you see
Chained
To the rock
And Peter is the rock
Peter is the rock
And the woman
Who is chained to the rock
Is Peter's wife
And her mother
Is the reclining woman
Whom Jesus cures
Do you see?
Now this is beautiful
This is not the work
Of a primitive historian
Of just somebody who
Is just cobbling together
A few stories of Jesus that he's heard
This is
Absolutely beautiful
Literary
Creation
Bill this is
Real quick
I know you want to get into the next question
But you know how I get every once in a while
I love this
Bill this is amazing
I've heard you say before
And I don't want to get into too far of a rabbit
But I've heard you say
They knew how to write history
It's not like they couldn't have
Wrote history
And so
This time period is not
Foreign to actual history
Accounts
And this account is
Completely different
Than what a historical account from the first century
Looks like am I wrong
You could just say I agree
Let's move on to the next question
I agree entirely
And I've been working recently
On Herodotus
And the Ucidides
The Greek historians who were writing
Four or five centuries
Before the gospel
Writers
And they knew what history meant
And how you should write history
They didn't write it in the sophisticated way
That historians today
Write with absolute meticulous
Concern about detail
But they knew what it meant
And what chronology meant
And how one thing follows another
But the gospel writers
Don't work on that kind of basis
And so we're not dealing
Of course they use historical figures
You know Pilate was a historical figure
John the Baptist was a historical figure
But they're not
Writing
Historical stuff
And so
You know
The interesting thing from my point of view
Is that the zodiac
Actually gives us a clue
As to what the story is mean
I'll give you another example
In the Cancerian section of Mark
The Cancerian section is a beautiful section
Because it deals
With the idea of exclusion
And incorporation
Cancer is the crab
And the crab
Is a creature
That has its skeleton
On the outside
And tender flesh inside
And in the ancient world
And in the modern world
Cancerian people are considered
To be
Like that you know
To have a tough exterior
And a nice soft interior
And
Cancer also represents
Or you know again
According to the textbooks
Cancer represents
Home, mom, apple pie
You know America
Born on the 4th of July
Is a Cancerian nation
And I know that sounds ridiculous
But it has all the
Elements of
Cancer
In its peculiar
Psychology
You know Americans
Ambrose Bier said
That war is
God's way of teaching Americans
Geography
Because
Americans really don't know
What the rest of the world looks like
They know America but that's it
You know only 21% of Americans
Have class spots
They don't particularly
You know the vast majority of Americans
Don't really want to leave America
And the whole idea of
Do you remember Regan
He said the Star Wars project
He wanted to put
A protective shell
Around America
To stop the Russian missiles coming in
These are images drawn
From cancer
From
From clannishness
From keeping your
The whole idea of
What Trump is doing now
Building a wall
Excluding
Elements
That you find
Objectionable
You want to keep everything out
That you don't like
These are cancerian
Notions
Now Jesus
In one of the most
I don't know
What are the most troubling
Episodes in the old
Gospel is when Jesus meets
A gentle woman
And she asks him to cure her daughter
And he says, I mentioned it earlier
It's not right for me to give
The children's food to the dogs
Now here Jesus is acting
Like
A
Clannish individual
He's a Jew and he's not
Going to help non-Jews
You see what I mean
But here we have him
He's almost
What we call Israel only
It's kind of embodying
Embodying
Now if you
If you look
At the stories which follow this
You have three stories
Which follow this
Which really
Explore the whole business
Of
How we should react
To people
Who are not our own people
And one of them is the story
Of the deaf man
Jesus cures a deaf man
And the word he uses
Is an Aramaic word
When he says to the man's ears
And the translation is
Open up
Open up
You see
That here is the instruction
Not to this deaf man's ears
But to you and me
And all of us
And the next
And not closed off
In any kind of crab-like way
And then
We have that wonderful
Story where Jesus cures the blind man
These are all in this section
Of the Gospel, the Canterian section
And he rubs the man's eyes
With a spittle
And he says to him
Can you see anything? And the man says
I can see people
But they look like walking trees
And then Jesus rubs his eyes again
And the man says
Ah yes I can see clearly now
Now this is the most
Beautiful
Parable
Of the human condition
You know all of us
All of us as human beings
What do we perceive
When we see another human being?
Isn't the story correct
When it says that what we're
Really perceiving are walking trees?
That is
We're not perceiving
People
As we consider ourselves to be
Or I consider myself to be
A person
They're almost ciphers
Or zombies or whatever it might be
They're people okay
Or they're real enough
But they're not real in the sense that
I'm real
What is required
Of the eyes again
The second rub of the eyes
Which enables people
As they really are
In the eyes of God
And so
That whole section is about
Exclusion and incorporation
And it's done
With these lovely images
Of
Jesus curing the deaf man
With the word fatha
And then curing the blind man
Who can only see walking trees
And then can see clearly
It's just
You know, I mean to me
I'm open-mouthed
In wonder of the skill of this
Writer
And another bit in that section too
This is in chapter 7
You have Jesus
Making the most roundabout journey
Do you know this bit
He goes from tire and siden
Through the decapolis up to
And
Every commentator you will read
Will say, will tell you
That this
Shows that the writer of the
Gospel of Mark didn't know his
Geography terribly well
But the point is
It shows
The crab
The movement of the crab
You see, this is a beautiful image
Here is Jesus
Scuttling
In a way that the crab
Scuttles. The crab doesn't go
Directly anywhere
It just scuttles around
So this ridiculous journey
Of Jesus
Is a little
Of humor by the writer of the
Gospel saying, and here he is
Moving like a crab
You know, I mean so
I read Dennis Ninam
One of the
British scripture scholars
Of the 60's and 70's
And he said
That all these miracle stories in
Mark, you could put them in any
Or do you like, and he wouldn't make
Any different. My point is
It would make every different
The stories are where they are
Because they each reflect
They each
Supplement what the stories
Which have come before them
Tell us, they're not episodic
They are connected
And they're connected by the theme
That the zodiac sign
Represents
And so
We cannot read the stories
Without understanding
What the zodiac signs
Mean
Now some years ago
I was talking to a professor
Of New Testament studies
From a prominent British
University And I told him
This theory, of course
He would have no time for this
But he said, well
I can't comment on it because
I don't know anything about astrology
Now this seems to me
To be
A ridiculous admission
You know, that
We have
A scholar
Who, I'm trying to
Think of his name now, he was a
A scholar
Of Mithraism
Who said that
Astrology
Although he deplored it himself
This is a 1930-20th century scholar
Astrology
Informed every aspect
Of life in the ancient world
Now if astrology
Informed every aspect
Of life in the ancient world
How come our scripture scholars
Know nothing about it?
It's like somebody saying
I'm an expert
On 60's pop music
But I don't know anything about
The Beatles, I'm sorry
You know, it's exactly
The kind of admission it is
No wonder they go around
In circles
In asking these historical questions
Because they're not prepared
To do it
This particular
New Testament professor
He could, in a week
He could have bought a couple of books on astrology
He could have read them
And he could have familiarized himself
With this very important
Aspect of thought
In the ancient world
But he was not prepared to do it
In exactly the same way
That
The scientists at the time of Galileo
Wouldn't look through
His telescope
Oh, I'm not looking at that
I know what I know
I don't want to
My understanding
In any other way
This is why we're dealing with it
I'm on Facebook
On numerous websites
And every day the question is
Did Jesus exist?
Was there a Jesus?
It's the same question
Again and again and again
And nobody's
Or very few people
Actually looking at the whole thing
From a different perspective
Because when we do
We realize
And this is telling an important thing
That everything we need
Every instruction we need
About living the gospel
Living the spiritual life
Is present in the gospel of Mark
Everything
And you know
I don't think we need to go outside it
I don't think we even need to look
At the sermon on the mount
I think that if we were really
Examine the gospel of Mark
And the meaning of these stories
And stopped asking
Ridiculous questions about them
And stopped trying to explain them
In ridiculous ways
For instance
I'm sorry I'm going on here
And it is late but I'm not going
You know you have
You have that story of the feeding
Of the five thousand
Feeding of the four thousand
Now these appear in the gospel
In the Canterian section
Because again if you read
The literature
You find that cancer
Concerns the stomach
And food
And Jesus
Is he feeds
Five thousand people
Then he feeds four thousand people
Only last week
On one of these facebook pages
He was saying
That the person who wrote
Mark's gospel has included two versions
Of the same story
And one of them should be eliminated
Absolute balderdash
There are two stories
That the numbers are different
In both of them
And the numbers are significant
The feeding of the five thousand
The numbers
Five and twelve are Jewish numbers
The five books of the Torah
The twelve tribes of Israel
That's the number of baskets
That they collect up twelve
The word for basket
Used in that
Is a Jewish word for basket
The feeding of the four thousand
The numbers are
Gentile numbers
We have four which is
The four corners of the earth
That is not simply
Israel but the four corners of the earth
And they collect up
Seven baskets
The belief was
That there were seventy or seventy-two
Gentile nations
So the two stories
Have to be taken together
To understand what they're saying
Because here the bread of God
God's manner
Is for all people
And the two stories
To specify that
When you...
One is not simply a copy
Of the other
Both are necessary
And both will give us an understanding
Of universalism then
In contrast
To Jesus' actions with this
Hierophonician woman
Where he's shown
Being clannish and exclusive
But further on in that very section
The whole thing is opened out
To include everybody
And
You know
Jesus walks on the water
Now
The ludicrous ideas
That you have for this
Well he didn't really
Walk on the water
There was a rocky outcrop
And he walked along it so far
Now of course walking on the water
Naked about what this
You know again
There is
A constellation called Argo
Which is very close to cancer
And
Argo is the ship
That the Argonauts sailed in
And it is called by
Manilius who's a Roman
Astrological writer
The ship which conquers the waters
Now
Conquering the waters
Is about
Conquering
Or
Controlling the emotions
You know water has always
Realized the emotions
And to be able as Jesus
Does to walk on the water
Is to
Show control
Over the emotional life
Which is something we are all
Called upon to do
In exactly the
Exactly the same way
Here is Jesus conquering the water
Which is conquering the emotions
When he rides
On a horse
Unbroken horse into Jerusalem
He's conquering
The fire
Of
Human action
You see how it works
When he controls the wind storm
He's controlling the air
And so all these things are there
Once we stop
Asking ludicrous
Historical questions about them
We can try
We can get some understanding
Of what the writer
Is telling us
So Bill
These things are not episodic
They are not historic
Let me ask you this
You talk briefly in your book
Towards the beginning about the precession
Of the equinoxes
Where the celestial background of the earth
At the start of the spring
Shifts to a new zodiac sign
Every 2100 years
Oh so
The age of Taurus, for example
Gave way to that of Aries
And about the time of the writing
Of the New Testament
The age of Aries shifted to that of Pisces
And it was also a change
Over the great year
Of the Platonic year
To what extent, Bill, do you think
That the Gospel of Mark
Might have been commemorative
Or maybe a celebration
Of coming into the new great year
Because it seems somewhat
Historic to me, it's so festive
I think you're right
I think that in fact
The whole of the Christian
Scriptures
All of them together
Are about
The new age that the people
Had been expecting
And it's the new age
Of the fish, you know again
Joshua
Do you remember
From reading
The Old Testament
Who Joshua
Was
That he was said to be
The son of Nun
N-U-M
Now Nun
Nuna in Aramaic
I think it's Aramaic
Means fish
Joshua is the son of the fish
Jesus again
The avatar
Of the new age of the fish
The age of Pisces
And if you look at the Gospel
You'll find
28 references to fish
And fishing and fishermen
Which is
You know really quite astonishing
I think
And highly symbolic stories
And little
Stories like the fact that Peter
And James and John were fishermen
Who were to become fishers
Of men
And so
The new age was the age of Pisces
The age of fish
The age of the fish
And the very first Christian symbol
Was not the cross
The very first Christian symbol
Was the fish
You know the fish symbol
That people wear on their lapels
And on their cars
These days you can make it by
This was the earliest Christian symbol
And that Jesus was the fish
And we have that
Acoustic which they had
Ichthos
Jesus Christ's son of God
Saviour
Which were in Greek
Which came from the initial letters
Of the Greek word for fish
So the very first Christian creed
Was based around the Greek word
For fish
So the fact that we're going into
That this is about the new age
Is very clear
In the gospels
And
Again
We cannot be thinking
In terms of history
When
When we realize
That this
Almost cataclysmic
Event
Was taking place
As a cataclysmic event
Because we have no understanding
Of these celestial cycles
But the people of the past
Knew
That the equinox
Which had been for 2100 years
In the constellation Ares
Was now moving
Into the constellation Pisces
And that
The gospels and the writings
Of the Christian
Of the early Christians
Reflect
That transition
And right at the end
Of the gospel of Matthew
You know that the final words
In the King James version are
Jesus said
Low I am with you always
Even to the end of the world
Now that's a mistranslation
Which the King James version made
And which we have followed
Slaveishly ever since
The actual word in Greek is
One
And low I am with you always
Even to the end of the age
Says Jesus
The age
The age of Pisces
We are now moving into a new age
You know remember the song from the
1966
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The equinox is now moving
Into Aquarius
And so transformation
Is a foot once more
And we have to
Be ready for it and we have to
Be
Able to understand
What it means
And I think
This is the great challenge
Of Christian thinkers now
To
To transform
Our understanding
Of spiritual imagery
Now that
Things are changing
And Aquarius is
Manifesting itself
And there's no question
It is manifesting itself
You know I mean
The man carrying a jar of water
Which is the symbol
Of Aquarius
Is
A man doing a woman's job
We have this
We have this strange
Mixture
Of the role
Which is precisely what
We are perceiving now in the world
I mean this is just one manifestation
Of Aquarius
Of
Female liberation
And of
Sexual identity being
Confused
And the whole
Business of
Communication
You know the internet itself
Is about as Aquarian as possible
To be
So we are on the verge
Of a new transition
Really
Bill that being
Said
This kind of transitions into
I guess you'd say into a vein
That is one of my favorites
And I have a lot of favorites
Just ask Luther I'll tell
Man and one of my favorite things is
Oh and also one of my favorite things
So another one of my favorite things
Is
Synchrotism
Or this idea
That other religions
And cultures
Have similar or the same
Stories
And so one of the reasons
And I'm jumping to a conclusion
When I state this one of the reasons
I think that's why
When you look at Jesus and you always hear
Mythicists or hear people
Who aren't even mythicists
That just comparative religions and they go
Oh well look this is the same hero
Story in all these different cultures
Who was it Joseph Campbell
He was huge on that showing that it's a hero
Story and you see
Well born of a miraculous birth
At 12 years of age did something
That confounded the wisdom of the
Wise men and then all of a sudden boom
He's doing a ministry
He's doing miracles
He has 12 followers
He somehow is self sacrificial
He dies and in some way
Is rebirthed or something happens
Where he overcomes
The enemies in some sense
And there's a conclusion that one day
They will be with their master
And so forth
And so the same story it seems
Is running through all of them
And so a lot of people look at that
And they just go oh well yeah it's there
But they don't really see
How this theme and why this theme
Is so important and my assumption
And hunch is the reason
Why is because they're all
Astrological
They're all tying into the same
Thing you're talking about in the gospel
Of Mark they're all
Tapping into that same ancient
Astrological wisdom
And how it applied
To every human that has
Ever existed it is applicable
Even if certain cultures
Took it and used it
For their own people
If that makes sense
Would you want to elaborate on that
Maybe some emphasis on that
Yes I would actually Jerry
I think that
You're right
I think you do find these examples
Of these stories
That have been there's lots of work
Been done much of it ignored
By
Orthodoxy
Showing how many of the stories
The bible can be traced back
To say to Egypt
And it's true
I think you can
I've not really done
Any extensive work on this
But I can see the
The patterns
But and I think
Is the significant thing
It is not simply the story
Which is significant
Or important it is the way
In which the story is handled
And told
That is
That is significant
So you might find
A story in another
Tradition
Which is similar to
One that you find in the gospel
But it's the way the gospel
Handles the story
Which gives it
Real significance
Using an example I gave earlier
The calming of the storm
The calming of the storm
Which occurs
In the Gemini section
Of the gospel of Mark
It's a wind storm
And it bears
Strong
Connections
With Greek mythology
And strong connections
With Homer
But
It is not simply
A
Repetition of those stories
It is used in a
Specific way
And it is changed
Ever so slightly
Or it might be more
Than ever so slightly
In order for it to
Carry the weighted meaning
That it has
In the gospel
So where the
In Greek mythology
Is called upon
Castor and Pollux
To save them
In the gospel they call upon Jesus
To save them
And it's that little change
Which is significant
Or one of the significant features
Of the story
You find the same thing
In the Old Testament
I've been working recently on
Moses
And you find the story
Being cast adrift
On the waters
In a basket
You find that all over the place
But the way in which
The author of Exodus
Handles the story
Makes it significant
Because he turns in many ways
Turns the story
At the old stories
On their head
So Moses is
Hasn't, there are many
Characteristics
Of the Moses story
Which can be found in other mythologies
But the way in which
Moses is presented
Is different from the characters
That appear in these
In these other mythologies
And I think that's the significant thing
All the way through
The Bible
They don't slavishly copy
Corporate, they transform
They change
All the stories
That they take
Which is all a part
Of good mythmaking
One of the worst aspects
Of scriptural understanding
You know this idea
That Richard Dawkins said
One of his most disparaging
Alper
He said that
The Bible was written
By primitive goat herders
You know this is
The most disgusting thing
To say
The Bible is written by
People of genius
And
Once we
Once we grant that
We realize, you know that
When the Bible was written
The human race was about
200,000 years old
Now, that's a long time
To accumulate wisdom
We tend to think
That the Bible
Were writing the Bible
In the infancy of the human race
Nothing could be further
From the truth
These were people
Of the
The climax
Of a whole
Tradition of wisdom
Which was thousands of years old
And could be traced
In all kinds of ways to mythologies
And oral stories
And so
You know that we're not dealing
With primitive stuff here
We're dealing with things
You know the most
Sophisticated kind
I'm sorry, Derek, go ahead
No, I was just going to say
That's right up Luther's alley
He kind of proves it with numerics
And often the gematria
And interesting stuff
So I was just trying to point out
That a lot of the research that Luther
Does actually shows
The genius of the work, in my opinion
The reason why people like the anti-theist
Such as Richard Dawkins
Whether you're a theist or not
Doesn't matter, I mean
What I'm saying is someone like
Richard who's so against it
In my opinion is
He's really going against
Historicist Christians
He's really going against the guys
And I tell you, you must believe
That a giant fish swallowed a guy
For three days and three nights
And you know, it's literal
And so I think that's where the hatred begins
Because then they also go and tell you
When you die, you're going to literal hell
And God's going to bake you
And you know, grotesque concepts
Of what I would suggest
Or grotesque of a deity
But Luther, I didn't mean to
Interrupt your brother
No, that's great, Derek
Bill, also that
People are not letting the scriptures
Be what they are
That is universal, always relevant
And ever expanding
That's what a myth does
That's the nature of a myth
And I love the quote that you make
Bill from
Salist, also called
Celestia, some call him the Roman poet
And you say something very important
About myth
As opposed to history
I always use that quote
From you, what you say
About Salist
Would you repeat that for our audience
And talk a little bit about that
The relationship?
Myth is not something that happened
But something that is always
Happening
And I think that is
Absolutely telling, very, very important
Joseph Campbell said that
All the great characters
In the mythological stories
Are still walking the streets of New York
Sitting
On Fifth Avenue waiting for the lights
To change
And the great characters of mythology
Are
With us
And probably
Within us, each individual
Carries a whole load of them
Around
Narcissuses with me
And a variety
Of other people
And so
And so
You see, I say that when we look at the
Gospel
We shouldn't say did Jesus
Do that, did Jesus
Say that
These are side
Questions for me
The question I ask is
What does this
Say about me
Not what does this say to me
But what does it say about me
That every character
In the Gospel
Is
I in some way
To give you an example again
Take it from the first part of the
Gospel
The man that they lowered down through
The roof, the paralyzed man
Now, this occurs in the
Airies section of the Gospel
And interestingly
Airies is to do with
The tops of things
That if you look at the
Zodiacal man
You know the figure of the Zodiacal man
Airies represents the head
And airies represents the tops
Of anything, it represents roof
And so
Lower the man down the roof
Here is an airies flag
An airies indicator
But who do they lower down
They lower down the man
Who is paralyzed and Jesus says to him
Your sins are forgiven
And of course
Everybody complains about
Saying this, you know
How dare he say that he can forgive sins
So Jesus says
Okay, then I'll say this
Get up, pick up your bed
And walk and the man does
Now here again, you see
The man
Who is paralyzed on the stretcher
Who is being carried in by others
Is
Me
Because I'm paralyzed by the past
As everyone else is
When Jesus says
Pick up your bed and
Walk
His instruction is to me
Don't let the past
Cripple you
Get up
And stop
Winging about your fate
And do something
And
Get rid of that paralysis
That we all
Automatically fall into
In one way or another
And the other stories in this section
The man with the withered hand
What a beautiful image that is
Of a person
Operating on half power
You know, his hand is withered
And Jesus says
Stretch out your hand
And he cures him
And he holds strength again
That's me too
You see how it works
Or take in the Gemini section
The man with the
2000 demons inside him
Well
I'm afraid there's 2000 demons
Inside me
As there is inside everybody else
Do you see what I mean
That all of us
Carry around
A whole host of characters
In what appears to be
Our
Uniform self
But none of us is
A uniform self
We are all of us
And we all of us
Display to the world
Different characters in different situations
I agree
You know that these individual
People
Are
You and I
And this is how
Mythology has a relevance
Which history
Cannot have
Because history is one damn thing
After another, as somebody described it
It happened once
Or it didn't happen
But these great stories
Are great
Because they're still happening
And they're happening in my life
And in your life
This is why I say
That Mark's gospel
Properly understood
Is as much as I need
For living the spiritual life
Because the airy section
Tells me how I should
Challenge the status quo
It tells me how I should
Stop being crippled by the past
The torrid section
Which is about growth in the spiritual life
Tells me about how
I should apply myself
To maintaining
Spirituality
The Gemini section
Teaches me about my own duality
And so on
It goes all the way through
But if we
Interpret these stories
As being simply
Historical events
We miss the
Sublime message
Of the whole
You know, Bill
I agree
If I may ask just this one question
clergy
Of which you are one
Former Unitarian clergyman
Who over the centuries
Have come into this kind of revelation
Giordano Bruno
Robert Taylor
Bill Donahue
Craig Lyons
Kevin Ramsey
And that's just to name a few that we know about
Who have embraced
Astral theology to various
Extents and at different levels
What has this
Done really to you?
What effect has all this had on you really?
Does this give you a sense of your place in history
Or of your destiny?
What do you make of it?
Seven years ago I was in New Zealand
I was operating as a part
Time, not as a full time
But short term
Minister with the Auckland Unitarian Church
And I
I was in a little place called Devonport
Which is a port area
Of Auckland
And I went into a second-hand bookshop
Because I had a meeting there
With the congregation
And I was
About an hour early so
I went into the second-hand bookshop
And a book almost fell off the shelves
You know how these things happen in life
This book
Was there in my hand
And it was called
Edipus Judaicus
By
What's his name?
Anyway he was in English
His name will come to me in a second
In fact it's a very important name
But
Drummond was his name
William Drummond
And he had written this book
200 years before
I didn't have an original
Copy this was a reprint
But
His theory was
Virtually the whole of the Bible
Is
Based around astronomy
And astrology
And his knowledge
Of Hebrew particularly
Was formidable
And he was showing
Looking at the Old Testament
How
Stories like
The story of
Jeff there for instance
In the book of Judges
The story of Samson
The story of
Joshua and the conquest
Of the Promised Land
How all these are based around
Astronomical metaphors
And he shows it
Looking at the language
And so I was absolutely
Riveted by this book
And I
I've worked on it and with it
Ever since but what is so
Interesting about it
Is that orthodoxy has completely
Ignored it
It has completely
Ignored it
And
Robert Taylor there
Robert Taylor was a
Classical scholar
And knew his biblical languages
Very well
Had a similar take
On a variety
Of biblical stories
One which springs to mind
Is the story of Lazarus
Which is in chapter 11 of John
Showing how this is
About this is an astronomical
Resurrection
Of the sun at the winter solstice
Nothing to do
With the actual
Citation of a dead body
That was stinking
And now these two men
Were writing 200 years ago
And they
Have disappeared almost
Without trace
That is not a university department
That would even give
Them two minutes
Of their time
And so they
Simply ignored
They're left for people like me
To
Have a look at
And work with
And be impressed by
But nobody
Who could change the way
People think about it
About them
Even seems interested in them
And this is a great
Sadness
But
I've learnt to live with that
And Eric
That my work
Is equally
Destined
To go into oblivion
Nobody in orthodoxy
Is concerned
With these kind of things
And of course
Those that are not in orthodoxy
Like the Unitarians
Are not bothered with them either
So
You have to grin
And realise that that's
An old series that I've been watching
In recent months, recent years
Secrets of the Bible
That appears on
Obscure channels every now and again
And somebody
Says he's discovered
A wheel
That would belong to one of Pharaoh's chariots
Or something
Somebody else says he's discovered
The house
Where Peter used to live in Capernaum
And
Thousands and thousands
Of pounds are expended
On
These kinds of programs
But nobody would even
Consider
The real secrets of the Bible
No
I think that in one sense
I've been expounding today
These are not
Things which people
Can seem to be concerned
About
I bought a book
I won't tell you the name of it
But a book on Exodus
Which is full of the most
Glorious colour photograph
I think it cost me something like
15 pounds, like $20 or something
But it must have cost
A fortune to produce
And
Because it belongs to
A Christian
Organisation
It can be printed
And disseminated
And made available
In all kinds of formats
But anybody coming with ideas
Which are not
Mainstream
Just ignore it
That's the
But I think we have to accept that
Maybe sometime in the future
Somebody will say
I think they might be onto
Something here
Something that just dawned on me, Bill
Something that came to my mind
About this, what you're saying here
It just seems to me
In all these cases
The people who are usually
Getting the support
This is just a hunch
It's probably a conspiracy
But I see it political
It's like these movements
Are attached to some type of
Political power structure
Behind them
And we're free thinkers
We're the remnant
We're kind of this small
Always going to be in that
Until it somehow does
Be seen in the public eye
But this is great stuff
And you're right, this is
The real secret
And there's even deeper
Stuff that goes on top of this
And it's not just
The astronomy and astrology
There are numerical values
There are significances
The numbers
And geometric numbers
And calculations
This thing goes so deep
You almost can't
And this is why I guess
I've done so much
If you've ever tried to explain
Something to a person or a child
That's never even come close
To what you're talking about
How do you bridge the gap
And explain where you're at
And so it's very tough
To turn it down a bit
To explain where I'm going with this
To somebody who's a historical
It almost seems, and I told this
To Luther earlier today
The historical approach to the text
Which is the popular one
Is the weakest one
It is the weakest explanation
Once you consider the evidence
And hold
So it's quite interesting
Let's see what we have here
Luther, did we talk
About the Bible?
Then it would seem to
Vindicate those who were called Gnostics
In some sense, the Valentinius
Who said that Jesus' ministry
Was a poetic zodiacal allegory
It was applied to know in the depths
Of human nature, beginning with the individual
I know we've touched briefly on that
I just figured I'd make mention
That was one of our questions we had
Did you want to mention anything
On like that, or would you want us
To move to another question?
I think, you know
Gnostic means
A lot of things really
And
We could spend all
The program talking about the meaning
Of the word
But I think
I think that
The Gospels come out of
A Gnostic school
That is a wisdom school
People who were
Aware that the age was
Turning
And who
Wrote stories
To reflect that
And to give people
A way of
Living spiritually
In kind of simple terms
In story terms
In narrative terms
But they were never meant to be
Historical and simply
Concentrating on the
Historical aspect of it
Has I think been almost
A waste of time
And it's put people off
You know, people like you were right
What you said earlier about Richard Dawkins
And Cole, people reject the Gospels
Because
Because it seems so absurd
But we still persist with it
Trying to make it less absurd
Trying to explain the anomalies
When really
If we treated these things as poetry
Instead of a history
We might have
A better understanding of
Of what they're supposed to
To represent
So I think
I think that they are
Gnostic
In their origin
And they've been historicized
For one reason or another
I think we can
We seem to be able to handle
History
More than we can handle poetry
And historians, sadly
Are rarely poets
Who's that? I'm sorry
You want to jump into who's rarely
Yeah, who's rarely a poet?
Bill, I didn't catch your last remark
Historians are rarely poets
Rarely
Historians, yes
Yes, certainly
I remember when I was in school
The whole school went to see
A production of Richard III
Starring Lawrence Olivier
This is many years ago
As we were coming out at the end
Two of the history teachers
Were talking
And I simply overheard
What they were saying
And one of them said
Well, of course, it never happens like that
I think I was about twelve at the time
But it struck me as
Even then strange
But even stranger now
That somebody could take
Shakespeare
And the genius of his poetry
And what he's telling us
About what it means to be human
And concentrate
On trivial historical detail
Do you know what I mean?
They didn't get their historical detail
As though they mattered
When what this play is about
Is what it means
To be a human being
And it's the same
With the gospels, you know
What does it mean
To be crucified on the cross
Of Matthew between two thieves
In Mark's Gospel
There were two thieves
And the two thieves reviled Jesus
In Matthew's Gospel
The two thieves reviled Jesus
In Luke's Gospel
One of them does
And the other one doesn't
Now here's another one of those little
Anomalies and contradictions
That could have been ironed out
Of people that wanted to iron them out
But then you think to yourself
What does it mean to be crucified
Between two thieves?
Well aren't we all crucified
Between two thieves?
The one on the left and we're told
The left and right
The one on the left is the past
The one on the right
The future
And they steal our life
Their thieves because they steal
Our life
And if we see that
Instead of saying
Were there two, did both of them
Reviled Jesus or did one of them repent
These are
Ridiculous questions to ask
And yet they're the only ones
We seem capable of asking
Hey Bill, Bill
Here's something
The famous trial lawyer
Clarence Darrow
Said that
Our lives are ruined
By two things
The first half ruined by our parents
And the second half by our children
That sounds like two thieves
Of the past and the future
Yes
It's the same thing isn't it
Right
Well look gentlemen
We've got 14 minutes left
On the clock
We've got time for one more question
Luther and then I'd like us
To do a closing out
So go ahead brother
Well
All my substantive questions
Have really been asked
There's one that remains in my mind
You posited a possible
Alexandrian authorship for
The Gospel of Mark
Now I've been examining Acts 27
And I've found evidence that the
Alexandrians may be responsible
For that work
The Acts of the Apostles
Have you looked seriously
At possible Alexandrian authorship
Of Mark
What do you think Bill
I haven't looked at it too closely
Really Luther I think
I said Alexandria
In the book because I think
It was a kind of
Center of
Gnostic thought wasn't it
And so I thought that
The likelihood
Would be that it
That it came out
Of a school that
Was located there
But more than that I can't say
I really don't know
I can't really say any more
Than that Luther
In one sense
I think I was really
Trying to get away from the notion
That
People have about Mark
You know I was watching one of the
Or the EWTN
The Catholic Channel some time ago
And there was a woman
Talking about the Gospel of Mark
And she said the Gospel of Mark
Was written by
John Mark at the
Dictation of Peter
That these were Peter's
Reminiscences
And he
Was simply in his old age
He was telling
Mark all the things
That he could remember that Jesus
Had said and done
And Mark wrote them down
And he put them down in a kind of
Aphazard way
But they're
Substantially accurate
And historical
This was just recently
This woman was giving this talk
And the other kind of thing
That I was teaching kids
Not that I believed it
Twenty, thirty years ago
When I was teaching these things in school
That the Gospel of Mark
Are the reminiscences of Peter
And it was to get away from
That notion that I postulated
That it came out of
A wisdom school
Probably in Alexandria
But we wouldn't know
Any more
Specifically than that
Right, well the Alexandria
Certainly had exposure
To the most sublime thoughts
In the world at the time
And I think about
An interview you once did
Bill where you talked about
James Joyce's epic novel
Ulysses
And there was a comparison made
Between that work
And Mark
And really if you're reading Mark
It behooves you to have
Some familiarity
With the literature forms
And with the great works
Regarded as such at the time
What are we to do
Living in this post-literate society
Where literacy is
So uncommon
And unnecessary to survival
Are we at an inherent disadvantage
In taking on a book such as Mark?
I don't know whether we're
More at the disadvantage than
Previous generations
I think it's
I think there will come a transformation
Or the transformation is possible
If we simply
Flick the switch
You know
I think
Some element of
Literary expertise
Is required
In looking at the gospels
And in the bible in general
But we're so obsessed
With the historical
That we can't just
Flick that little switch
And start to look at it differently
I don't think
We're post-literate
I think that
Obviously
People
Very, very skilled
In these things and very intuitive
And sensitive to them
But they've just not been
Introduced to them
In churches and chapels and
Universities
Nobody's looking at them
In quite this way
But
I hopefully hope
Although as I said earlier
I've no great expectation
Of it occurring
But I fondly hope
That one day people will
You know that
The second rub of the eyes will come
And we'll
Let's look at these things
Differently now
And once it
You know like so many things
Once these things start
They have a life of their own
But there's a formidable
Formidable
Opposition
Forces really
We want to keep
We want to keep laughing
At the bible stories
Because they're absurd
And people
In the opposite camp
Who wants us to keep thinking
That they're the oracles
Of God in the way
That they're expressed
Almost in the translations
That we get which is
Nonsensical itself
You know I mean
The idea that the bible
Has been translated
In any kind of sensible
And coherent way
Consistently
Is ludicrous to me
You know you cannot
You cannot encapsulate
The Hebrew particularly
In
In the kind of
Symbolic that we've been
Attempting to do
Like somebody
Who was
In one of these
Facebook pages talking about
The Hebrew word
Ruach
Meaning
Breath
Which we always translate to spirit
And the Greek word
Numa
Which again we always translate to spirit
Why don't we translate these words as breath
Why don't we talk about
The holy breath
That's a perfectly good translation
Of the Hebrew
And if we did say that
Wouldn't the document that we're reading
Read very differently
Because breath
The kind of
Insubstantial
Quality
Which spirit doesn't have
And
I mean this is just one example
And yet
Traditionally and consistently
We use the word spirit
And when we do
Do we translate spirit with a big S
Capital S
Or with a small S
You know it all depends
Your theology is betrayed
As soon as you write
The first letter
If you've translated
Holy Spirit
Capital H, Capital S
Then you're a Trinitarian
If it's small H, Small S
Then you're just a witness
You know what I mean
Yeah bro
Right
Yes indeed
It's interesting you say that
I'll end on a little quick note
Real fast here on that
And then I want to ask you one question Bill
If you don't mind before we get off here
But an interesting note I've heard
That it's a tradition
And there are African tribes
It's a tradition when the father's passing down
Pretty much when he's
Handing over to his son
That leadership quality
That role in life
He would grab his son by the back of his head
Pull his head in
Forehead to forehead
You can only just kind of close your eyes
And imagine
He's holding his son's head
To his head
And he takes a deep breath
And he exhales
Into his son's mouth
While his son inhales his father's breath
And in doing that
He actually is taking over
Or being given
That rulership
That next you know you're now me
You see and so
It takes on a whole new role
When you don't just look at it through
These historical lenses
And using other
Ideas that are around the world
I mean especially in the ancient world
But this is
All we have left for this program
We've got five minutes left
So what I want to do
Is I want to
End with
How do people help
Sponsor or help support
Your research
The book that you're probably coming out with soon
I know you don't want to give us the name
Maybe give us a little cliffhanger if you will
What it's about and then
Maybe we could do another show
Because this is awesome
Well I would
Prepare
I think
Obviously I would like people to buy
My book's been particularly
The Celestial Journey of the Soul
Simply because
The Gospel and the Zodiac is fine
And they can download it now
Because it's no longer in print
But the Celestial Journey of the Soul
Is more
What's the word
Because these are sermons
It's more related to
Living if you know what I mean
Rather than
The Gospel and the Zodiac
Which is a kind of academic treatise
But the Zodiac and the Soul
Covers the same area
But has
A different kind of
Feel, it's much easier to understand
And it is available
And it's quite cheap really
You can
Get a copy for it
I think it's about nine dollars or something like that
So that's one way
I'm retired now
And I don't particularly need
To make any money out of
Out of my books
I just like people to read these things
And talk about them
Maybe if they're on
A particular website
Or on Facebook pages
To mention these ideas
And that would be
That would be sufficient from my point of view
The book that I've finished now
But I've not yet decided on a title
Either
It might be, it's either going to be called
Moses the Matador
Which shows
That Moses is a
Nomeical figure
Fighting the bull of Torah
Right
I love it, I love it
Great, I know what you mean
Or I also thought about calling it
The Seacross's Guide to the Galaxy
Which is
About
The whole business of
Astral Theology
And how it fits into
Our Biblical understanding
And what the Seacross's are
Because what does Hebrew mean
What is a Hebrew
What was Abraham
These words
Hebrew and Abraham
Both come from the Greek verb meaning
To cross over
And what does crossing over mean
Well, I think it means
We go from one age
To the next
And
We're now on the verge
Of another crossover
And so we need
A guide to the galaxy
And what it should mean
To our spiritual life
Yes
I actually would like
To talk about it
When it's available
Really
I look forward to talking
To you guys again
We still look forward to it
Exactly
We're going to have you on
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're hearing this
This is Bill Darlison
Bill, you have stayed up super late
In New England to do the show
We really appreciate you being on here
Guys, check us out
We have a Facebook group
If you want to support us
In this endeavor of ours
On trying to
If you will uncover the real secrets
Of what's going on
In the biblical text
And give you guys deeper knowledge
We bring scholars on the show
We bring authors, we bring a lot of
Different ideas
We're going to have a lot of variety
Of different topics on the show
Please help support us
We have PayPal accounts that helps us
Put it towards the program
Mine will be in there
Guys, we even have the Water Boys
Show, so anything we receive
Helps us with this
And we have a room pertaining
To the Water Boys
And it's the Water Boys podcast group
On Facebook, that's all we got
Have a good night gentlemen
Thank you all, goodbye
Good night, Jerry
Goodbye
Music
