People believe some of the weirdest stuff in the world in fact
I was one of those Christians who believed every jot and tittle in this book
We call the Holy Bible was literally true when a prophet spoke and said thus sayeth the Lord
I actually believed that was God
Speaking and that these men
were almost like a portal like a
Vessel through which God's voice would actually convey a message
And now that I've done some serious serious study from academics. I asked Dr. John J. Collins who's written
extensively
extensively on the Hebrew Bible
Apocalypticism eschatology you name it and the questionnaire from our patreon. Thank you so much for supporting us here
consider joining
Asks a very very important question
Why can't God?
Just speak straight
Why do things have to be so difficult to understand?
The way that John J. Collins answers that question is even more intriguing
Professor John J. Collins, thanks so much for joining me. I'm sorry about this good a friend of mine
And also a patreon member and already Hagen says for dr. Collins one thing that I find confounding about apocalyptic literature
Is it's obscurity? I would think that if there is an almighty God and if that God has some message
Some a hugely consequential message
This I love the way you're leading up already. This is interesting a hugely consequential message
Yeah, that he wants to communicate to humanity then it is puzzling why this message is so obscure so ambiguous
It does not seem credible that the God who once inscribed ten commandments on stone tablets would now be resorting to sending these
Surrealistic surrealistic sorry visions. So then my question is why have so many people taken these somewhat bizarre documents so
very seriously
Well, you know people some people take them as actual revelations
now
First of all, it's not going to do you any good to ask why God does one thing or another
Yeah, we have no access to that
The question really is why do people write supposed revelations in
this kind of a style
Now the ten commandments are rather exceptional in so far as they're clear
That's very unusual in the Bible
No, but most prophets most
Apocalyptic writers know have visions that are enormously complicated
Now, why is that?
Well, it's because put yourself in the position of the person having the vision and
instead of thinking of them having a vision think of them trying to figure things out and
And when they try to figure things out
They realize life is obscure
most of the big problems in life are obscure and
So, you know, what they want to convey is the sense of seeing in the glass darkly
They don't want things to seem too clear
They often also want to leave things so that they can be interpreted in more than one way and
That if the initial
Interpretation doesn't work out you can go to plan B
But I think it's an attempt to respond to the obscurity of life and
The the answer really to to the question is that you're coming at it from the wrong side
It doesn't do us any good to speculate on why God did this or that
We don't really know what God did or did not do what we have our writings that claim
God said or didn't say something and
That's the question is white. Why do the writers the human writers do with this that brings up an interesting question
I think that's so basic
You're gonna be like, okay. Yeah, this is a powerful question asked though. What is a prophet because
Watched your recent lecture on this old desmond interpretation and you do such a fantastic job on just showing the humanity
Of these texts, but you know prophets were a dime a dozen and they were in the pocket of the kings and then
Maybe you can tell us about prophets and what they're what was their role?
What were they were supposed to do that might answer the question in a more proper angle so then you can kind of know
Well, now a prophet is a person who claims to get inspiration and
to be
inspired by some kind of divine spirit
Now you've the story of Balaam
Balaam wasn't even supposed to be in Israelite
But you know, it seems like he has something like an epileptic fit and then while he is in that state he sees something
Now so no doubt prophets were people who had strange experiences and
That's what gave them credibility
to some degree
For a lot of the Old Testament of Hebrew Bible period
You have whole guilds of prophets
If they first appear in the books of Samuel they travel in packs and
you hear of
Saul Samuel conducting them and
Saul at one point takes off his clothes and lies down naked with them all night
He gets some kind of ecstatic behavior
But for all of that, you know the prophets that we have in the Hebrew Bible
Are managing their ecstasy
in other words, they
Try to say things that do make sense and a lot of it is political
Kings kept according to some accounts a king could have 400 prophets
Who ate at his table is the way they put it. In other words, he was supporting them
Now the king decides he wants to go to war
But he wants to consult
The prophets first to seize this the will of God
What are the prophets going to say?
Yes, your majesty do what is in your mind your majesty and then the interesting prophets are the one out of the
400 who will buck the trend and
go against it and
Tell the king yes, go up to battle that you're going to get killed and
Then the king has the dilemma which one should he believe and
The the best solution is go up to battle and if he gets killed he'll know that the one prophet was right
But it's a little late for him then
And that's the way to test all of these actually is after the fact X event to it's all after the fact
It's the only really, you know the other question you have if the king might have asked himself is is this something?
I really need to do is there's a risk they are to take
hmm
This begs a question further under the prophets if you don't mind before we hop off that idea. Are there any clear?
descriptions of
Prophets that are aware of other prophets writings that they purposely don't agree with and they contradict
I mean there are certainly stories of prophetic conflict
They don't usually involve other prophets through writings we have
Actually, none of the prophets really wrote anything
You know they gave oracles and somebody came along afterwards and wrote them down
There are definite differences in perspective say between Jeremiah and Ezekiel
Both of whom lived through the destruction of Jerusalem and that they read the whole course of events very differently
But you don't get oracles preserved for their fating with each other you do get oracles preserved for Jeremiah is faking with other prophets
And he had a very hard time
Because he was telling people that God is on the side of the Babylonians and that just doesn't play
Yeah
So are there contradictions though you would say maybe between different prophet books? Well, yeah, I mean what what constitutes a contradiction
right maybe
You know is debatable, but definitely different perspectives like they don't agree with a
Particular what their purpose or intentions aren't certain took to oversimplify the thing
according to Jeremiah
The reason Jerusalem was destroyed was because they weren't practicing justice
According to Ezekiel the reason
Jerusalem was destroyed was they weren't preserving holiness
In purity now those are very very different
takes on it
Not necessarily incompatible with each other, but they're pulling in opposite directions
It even seems like some of these prophets have a like you talked about a vision of a
Universal even sometimes optimistic for nations that aren't Israel. Yeah, whereas others are like no, we're gonna just crush these people
We just yeah defeat and kill the enemy that seems like that could
Possibly qualify for like contradictions in a way like one is more optimistic about the the nations one's not yeah
But you know there you can always work your way around the contradiction of course, you know, you but there's enough wiggle room
But they're different
Has that ever frustrated you that that when you're like reading other scholars and you're like you get a little bit like
Like it's not
So clear black and white
This is what it actually means to a point where you see certain scholars you're reading and you're gone
You're playing wiggle with me in some of some of the chess. I mean, there's an awful lot of apologetic
scholarship out there
You know
Scholars who are trying to make the Bible look good
And you're trying to make it look bad either
No, no, but there's no point to make it trying to make it look good
You know because if you try to make it look better than it is
Well in the book of Job that problem is discussed very directly and Job says to his friends, would you lie for God?
Would you distort the evidence to make God look good and
And for Job obviously you shouldn't do that and he says he's not going to like it
Hmm and in the end of the book of Job, he doesn't
Thank you, dr. Collins
