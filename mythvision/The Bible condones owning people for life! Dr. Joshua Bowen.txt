Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen once again the expert Ben Lamarue and he has a statement not so
much a question but maybe you can delve it you'll get the gist chattel slavery means
that one person has total ownership of another literally nothing about the word chattel requires
large-scale plantations and we have plenty of evidence that chattel slavery existed in
ancient Israel this is not remotely disputed in scholarship now that sounds to me he's
really trying to he's talking about fundamentalist or at least evangelical fundamentalists that
are trying to ignore or say no chattel slavery is not there but please wherever you think
this statement leads you yeah I mean you know Christian apologists all the time will make
the argument that I mean if you just if you turn on any any major apologist talking about
this even even ones that I you know I think are better than others we'll say wow isn't
dentured servitude right and I know I talk about this a lot but like there's no question
Ben's absolutely right there's no question that chattel slavery whether whether it's
an evangelical scholar or a liberal scholar they're gonna say very clearly that if they're
biblical scholar they're gonna say that chattel slavery is in the legal sections of the biblical
texts and like the one place that you can see it most clearly is in Leviticus 2544 to 46 and
that's where they will go right so Richard Averbeck I think this is the behind the scenes in the
Old Testament this is a you know put together like John Walton is one of the editors but Averbeck
if this is I think this is the volume he did it in yeah where are we I don't know why if I should
be looking this up while we're here live but I just wanted to read Richard in 423 he did the
section on slavery so so chattel slavery it's the name of the section as noted above we cannot
always tell from the ancient Near Eastern sources whether a person was a dead slave or a chattel
slave or had some other status in the household context in ancient Israel chattel slaves could
be gained through purchase from the nations around them from the resident aliens who lived
among them and his prisoners of war or warfare refugees Israelite families could pass them
down from generation to generation Leviticus 2544 to 46 and Deuteronomy 2110 and 14 I mean it's like
as Ben said it's it's not disputed right and Richard Averbeck is an evangelical Christian
teaches a Trinity seminary it's like it's not maybe we should just ask the simple question in
light of this what is chattel slavery because like you when you throw words around especially for
someone who doesn't know they might go chattel slavery indentured servitude same thing no
difference and they don't really know what is a chattel slave so a debt slave is someone who is a
slave and that slavery is their slave status is just contingent upon their debt being repaid so if
they repaid the debt they're no longer a slave that's it it's as simple as that sometimes that
can be time right like you work for me for seven years that is your debt that's right being paid
off yeah so the reason that that time is put in place and I think we've talked about this in
other places but you know the reason that time is is there if both in the Hebrew Bible and in
like the laws of Hammurabi is that you know if if I owe you a hundred dollars and I can't repay it
and I become your debt slave well theoretically as soon as I pay you back the hundred dollars I'm
out right the problem is I'm not working anywhere else if I'm your slave right so are you sorry you
make ten bucks a day and I go cool so ten days I'll be out of here and you go but your room and
board cost you twelve dollars a day I mean like yeah you know so it if there's not a regulation on
that sort of thing you know you're the interest additional fees for things that the master is
doing like he can really it can either keep you there for a very long period of time or just indefinitely
um so but but debt slaves technically are those that their debt is the thing that keeps them a
slave or you know gets them released chattel slavery is just slavery that is not contingent
upon a debt so if they are property I mean there's no question about that they're considered property
unfortunately I think what we we sometimes mistake is that property means you can do absolutely
anything to them and that's not really the case not in the literal sense yeah but you point out in
your book yeah I mean they can be bought they can be sold like there's they can be beaten yes they
can be beaten that's what I mean like we there's some ugly stuff to this absolutely it but you know
in the antebellum south we've talked about this in other places but in the antebellum south
there were chattel slaves they weren't legally allowed to do whatever they wanted to them they
couldn't abuse them which sounds crazy given what we know but the law said they weren't allowed to
be abused outright abused they could be beaten but they didn't consider that to be abuse if you
beat someone above moderate correction then that was abuse and you couldn't murder them right but
the problem of course is how do you like regulate that like how do you actually put that into practice
and the same is true in the Hebrew Bible now what's interesting is there are some scholars that will
argue that the the laws that you see in like Exodus 21 most of them only apply to debt slaves
and I think that for the most part like 20 to 21 you know that that is about that is about debt
slaves and like somebody like Sam Gringis would say that chattel slavery there aren't laws that
protect the slave right like as if you could do anything to them yeah there's just there aren't
stipulated restrictions now I like I'd have to think about that some more and see what he's
what he's arguing but the point is that it seems like chattel slavery doesn't automatically mean
that you could outright abuse them or murder them or you know burn them or whatever you wanted
it was their their their slavery is not contingent upon the repayment of the debt
one thing ending on this topic and I think we touched on this last time but either way
I think this is great points going back to what I read today in your book as I finally was getting
to the end of it in the audible thank god for Seth god um interesting I think the cosmos yeah I don't
I don't mind I don't think whatever for Seth thank you for reading that it was a wonderful read
however you mention oftentimes and you do it such in a polite way but what apologists will do is they
kind of reverse that and they'll use those like defensible areas where it's like look you can't
you can't look see it's trying to protect and we talked about that like it looks like a good law
trying to say like they're on this equal playing field as a free person in the way that you're
supposed to treat them but no it's not like that they are a different level and you you when you
did it in your book the way you did it I couldn't I couldn't try and do it right now but because I
don't remember all the details um but you point out like in one of the contexts where it's clearly
um oh I remember the bull uh if a bull kills another person or something like that you know
obviously a free person then you're gonna be put to death if you knew the bull has done this before
it's been a common thing and you didn't keep make sure that bull did not get free or whatever
whereas a slave just pay 30 shekels or whatever of silver or whatever it might be that's a big
difference like if human life and not yeah and I mean like it's not that 30 shekels is a small
amount of money because it definitely isn't it's probably like three years worth of work right
but this is sort of the point um that a slave cost probably 30 shekels of silver
so it's being treated under property law it's not being treated under family law
and so I think that's as you say it's an important thing to recognize that you know people I think
have this idea and I'm sorry about that's when no you can hear them on the video um
um uh but you know people I think have this idea that everybody is treated exactly everybody's
valued exactly the same because there are calls for justice for example well justice in the ancient
world didn't mean everybody gets treated the same what justice meant was everybody gets treated
according to their status in other words you can't treat a free person lower than the status of free
and you can't treat a slave lower than the status of a slave you you have to treat them
commensurate with a rank right you can't do less that's what justice is is trying to establish so
quite often what you'll see is if a citizen falls into debt slavery um justice is you know bringing
about non-oppression of that of that person and so it often means after a period of time or you
know once in the king's reign or something he'll just declare freedom to everyone so now the the
free person who is um you know under debt servitude or whatever it gets released back to a free status
loan is repaid so interesting yeah thank you of course
so
