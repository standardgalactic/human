It helps me keep doing what I'm doing. All right. Love you guys
Ah
Myth vision welcome back to myth vision podcast your host eric Lambert
I have always looked at parallels between pagan stories and Jesus when I started being critical of the New Testament
And I remember looking at a lot of different videos people talking about this stuff
Well, I came across a gentleman named Dennis R. McDonald dr. McDonald and he has a thesis
The synoptic Gospels are using the Homeric epics as a literary source
So I said wow
I remember watching truth surge on YouTube and he goes into
Escavating the empty tomb and then I found out that the Gospel of John is also using
Euripides the Bacchai and
Mimicking but really making Jesus better than Dionysus. Is that really the case?
Well, stay tuned to make sure you guys check out dr. Dennis R. McDonald's works
They're down in the description and you guys can get your copy of this book the Dionysus and Gospel
I'm gonna go ahead and introduce our guest dr. Dennis R. McDonald. Welcome to the show. Thank you very much, Derek
McDonald earned his undergraduate degree from Bob Jones University a master of Divinity from McCormick Theological
Seminary and a PhD from Harvard University. He taught for many many many years
he knows a thing or two and
He's highly controversial in the
Scholarship guild that we have right now in the 21st century in light of mainstream scholarship on these topics
But I think he's on to something. Let me know what you guys think so
Welcome once again. Thank you so much for teaching me and my audience
They're really excited to hear what you have to say and I'm happy to follow wherever you take us
I said, thank you so much, Derek. I'm glad you introduced the synoptic gospels and our previous interviews
I'm not gonna say much about the synoptics because this time and next we're gonna talk about the gospel of John
But just so your viewers get caught up with memesis criticism
I'm gonna talk about the seven criteria that I use for determining
Whether you in fact have literary imitation and not just cultural context
The first two have to do with the model
That is is the model accessible
was it written earlier was it widely known and
Access and analogy where other people imitating the same text did it become a target for
literary work
The next three
Criteria have to do with the nature of the parallels between works
Criterion three are they dense?
Criterion four are they sequential and
Criterion five is distinctive traits. Are there things that are?
Flags that hold the two texts together in a kind of hermeneutical dance
Number six is
Interpretability what is to be gained by seeing one text as an imitation of another or if you will
Why would an author go to the trouble of imitating an antecedent and the seventh and this is the one
We're going to spend most time on today Derek is
ancient recognition
And did other people see the similarities between these texts?
And
Benefit from them. Dr. McDonald if I if I may I have to ask an interesting question. I think this would be
Fascinating because you're so scholarly on this stuff and and this is going to be for the layperson who introduces themselves to this episode
This is something I always used to do I'd ask my dad or something dad
How confident are you that you could beat that guy up?
You know because when I was young he knew how to fight and all that kind of stuff
Well son, let me tell you how confident I am. I kick is you know what?
How confident are you that the gospel of John is mimicking your rippity's about guy from your professional opinion?
Of course, I know it's your position
But how confident if you were to basis this on a probability scale from one to a hundred
How confident are you that you have it and and the other scholars are really ignoring the obvious?
So before we get into this because I want to convince our audience of this with the evidence
But I want you to give your your opinion here and then everyone can dive in
Okay, I'm going to demonstrate that I'm not a mathematician. I
Would say a hundred and one percent
I'm absolutely
I don't think there's any wiggle room on this question and that's what we're going to try to talk about tonight. I love this. Oh
This is great. Yes, sir
Okay, so bring the other guy on I can beat him up
I
Thank you so much. Yes, sir. All right. I
Want to start in the 5th century in Egypt
With an author we know as known as of penopolis
Penopolis is the city in Egypt
He wrote a paraphrase of the gospel of John
in
Verse and
Then he wrote the longest of all Greek epics the Dionysiaca
Which is actually gargulous and pretty lousy poetry very difficult to read and
People thought well, you know, they both are attributed to known us
But maybe one was written by somebody else or maybe he wrote the Dionysiaca and his youth
And then later converted to being a Christian and wrote the paraphrase of the gospel of John
But he's like me and old and wasn't quite as sharp as he used to be and so it was shorter and it wasn't as good
Modern scholars now say no, they're written by the same person and
In fact, the gospel of John was gone was written first
Portraying Jesus like a Dionysus character
Then later wrote the Dionysiaca
Maybe converting to Dionysian religion, but more likely
considering Jesus and Dionysus to be two faces of the same kind of a deity and
The reason the scholars say that is the Dionysus of the Dionysiaca is
much kinder and more gracious and
And and life giving
Than the Dionysus, let's say of Euripides Bacchai about which we're going to have more to say
Now it's fascinating to me that diet that a known us
Who would have known all of the Gospels presumably by the fifth century if he knew the gospel of John
Chose the gospel of John to be his model
And he wanted to rewrite the gospel of John
And in a Dionysian way
Now I'm going to argue that there are two things in the gospel of John that would have just jumped out at known us
To encourage him to do a Dionysian epic
On the gospel of John
And then I want to show that there's another passage where other people also recognize parallels between
Euripides Bacchai and the gospel of John and
It's something that modern scholars can't see but ancient readers certainly did
So that's going to be what we're going to do today next time
I'm going to talk about the three stages of the gospel of John and I'm going to give more examples
such as the trial between
Dionysus and
Penteas in the trial of Jesus before Pilate or the woman at the well
Jesus is going to give a living water to a woman that he meets outside the city who are like mine ads
We'll talk about the raise the
Liberation of Lazarus from dead and from his tomb
Like Dionysus escaping from his prison and there are many examples
But the one that I think is most striking and by the way other scholars have seen these first two examples that I'm going to give you is
The first miracle in the gospel of John and the author makes a point of it is
not like in the synoptics a
austere
Jesus in a synagogue casting out demons
But Jesus going to a wedding and supplying drunk revelers with more wine
Now that is got to jump out at any reader to say this is
Dinesian and I've asked you to look on your computer to John to and I want you to read the first 11 verses
No problem
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm reading from the RSV John chapter 2 the wedding at Canaan or Cana
On the third day there was a marriage at Canaan Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there
Jesus also was invited to the marriage with his disciples when the wine gave out the mother of Jesus said
Said to him they have no wine and Jesus said to her oh woman
What have you to do with me my hour has not yet come
His mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you now six stone jars were standing there for the Jewish rites of purification
Each holding 20 or 30 gallons
Jesus said to them fill the jars with water and they filled them up to the brim
He said to them now draw some out and take it to the steward of the feast
So they took it when the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine and did not know where it came from
Though the servants who had drawn the water knew the steward of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him
Every man serves the good wine first
And when when men have drunk freely then the poor wine, but you have kept the good wine until now
This is the first of his signs
Jesus did at Canaan in Galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him
Now certainly that is Dionysian
We have evidence in the second century
by a pagan author named Achilles Tatius
Who apparently used that story in the gospel of john as a model for retelling a story about Dionysus?
And i'm not the first person to have seen this parallel
So i'm going to read a summary of it. It's from
Achilles Tatius Luccipe and clitifon
Clitifon narrates his stay in Tyre. We're beautiful Luccipe
Saying him a love song filling him with desire later the couple marry
Then came dinner accompanied by wine which
fame
Fanned the flames of passion as the two young people became tipsy
The gift of Dionysus quote is the food of eros
Clitifon then tells the tyrians how they
Says how the tyrians discovered wine?
A poor farmer invited Dionysus to a meal
At which the god turned the farmers water into wine
When the farmer drank it he was bockock with pleasure and said to the god. Oh stranger. Where did you get this purple water?
Where did you find such sweet wine?
Sweet blood. Sorry sweet blood. This is what you read in the gospel of john
And when the chief steward tasted the water had become wine
And he did not know where
Same word that's used in Achilles Tatius where it came from
The servers who had drawn it knew and the chief steward called the bridegroom and told him everyone first presents the good wine
And then when people are drunk the inferior
But you've reserved the good wine until now
It's great quality quality, but also great quantity
Six water jugs full of wine and so this is
Surely Dionysian
And it would encourage someone like known us to target the fourth gospel to
Tell as a Dionysian like epic
But there's another trait of Dionysian religion that's very important
It's called omophagia and it follows a rite of sparrig moss
Sparrig moss is the ripping apart of an animal apparently usually a rabbit
And then having the initiates
In the rite taste the meat while it's still bloody
Omophagia means eating raw flesh
And the reason you have that rite is that Dionysus was apparently
According to the mythology killed by titans in the titomachia
and
Was restored by Zeus
To life and so he's the dying and rising god of greek mythology
And initiates by celebrating his death are in a way celebrating his life
and there's
Plenty of reason to think that these initiates thought that they in this participation were gaining eternal life
By identification with the deity
This appears in Euripides bakai as follows
Dionysus himself is delighted in the mountains when apart from the scurrying
Theosy that is the mine ads
He falls to the ground wearing his fawn skin a sacred garment as he hunts for the blood of slain goats
The sheer joy of eating raw flesh
Now of course we have
cannibalistic
Imagery in the synoptic gospels and in paul about jesus about the eucharist
That is that in the eucharist people are claiming to
Symbolize or actually getting eternal life
By drinking jesus's cup his blood and the the body
in the loaf
But nowhere is the
cannibalistic or
Tunisian
Emphasis as clear as it is in the gospel of jahm
And i'm going to read simply a few lines
The one who choose my flesh it's not just eat it's chew
It's choose my flesh and drinks my blood as eternal life
For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
Then when many of the disciples heard it, they said this saying is hard. Who can hear it?
It's hard because jews are not supposed to eat drink blood
right
And from this point on many of the disciples went back and no longer traveled with them. So it was scandalous
What scandalous about it? It's really quite dinesian
and I had a student write an entire dissertation on
These passages and the dinesian tradition among afagia
And it's because of such research
That I became totally convinced that the gospel of jahm is at least dinesian
But i'm going to let you ask some questions and yeah, you know i have
But i want to get soon to the bakai because the issue is not just that john's author or authors
Knows dinesian religion in this trying to create a jesus whose competitive
But also similar to dionysus
But actually using euripides bakai as a literary model and the bakai was the most important
Iconic description of dionysus in antiquity
And we know of imitations of it among jews and pagans and christians
There's a whole wonderful dissertation
Can't coming out of that came out of the university of minnesota by a friend of mine
A courtney freezing that shows how often the bakai was rewritten in order to establish social identities
Of pagans jews and christians
So we'll get to the bakai in a moment, but first we can stay with dionysus
Known as sub-panopolis and others saw in the gospel of john
Dinesian imagery
That most modern scholars would be somewhat embarrassed by
So a couple good questions. I think we can probe here just before we move forward and I love this dr. McDonald. I really do
First things first. It's obvious who these authors are
They didn't use matthew mark or luke as their literary
Book to make this claim. It was obvious the gospel of john was their claim
So that right there kind of tells you something number two
I mean at least it speaks something here and it can be used as evidence
Number two a christian apologist will try to argue as they usually do
Well, the that was second century. That means they borrowed it from the gospel of john
And uh, this guy who's writing from egypt. He or is it egypt?
I can't remember this. Yeah, he's borrowing from the gospel. So when they try to argue
Um, really what came first was jesus and not dionysus. Do you have a
Statement you could make about that before I ask my final question before we move forward
Um
Are we really trying to say that the author of the gospel of john
Had read achilles stasis
Uh luchipe in clitifon
No, really and of course that isn't
The direction can't go in the the direction of that direction
Well, no, no, I'm sorry that you I got you confused. I got your question confused
The cult of dionysus we know goes all the way back
At least to the sixth century bce
And it was widespread and we have lots of imitations of that that text
So if the there's a direct if there's a literary connection between these texts
Or even a history of religions relationship, it's got to be dionysian religion coming first
And you can imagine why this community would want well in fact, let me let me go into this now
Why would the author of the fourth gospel want to portray jesus as a dionysian like character?
Well, it could be to win
converts from dionysian religion
But I think it's actually written for christians to say
That just as dionysus offers eternal life and a good time and love
Jesus can offer that too
But if you read the synoptic gospels what jesus offers is a cross
What jesus offers is voluntary poverty
Pick up your cross and follow me sell your goods and give to the poor
Jesus is not a donor deity in the synoptics. He's a slave master
And I don't mean that critically
I mean that the suffering jesus invites people to suffer along with him
There's very little suffering language in the fourth gospel
The point of the prologue is that the lawgoss became flesh
And dwelt among us and gave us gift after gift
That's how I
Translate one of these phrases
So that the author of the fourth gospel inside of the gospel tradition has a reason to make jesus a donor deity
That the community of believers
Should understand that jesus offers gifts the same way that dionysus can offer gifts through the homophagia
through
And offer eternal life and so on
Okay, and then my final question and maybe you're gonna actually get into this
I I can't wait till to just discuss the prologue because that's going to be an interesting
How you compared the prologue and kind of you know show that if we're getting into that um, yeah
The the social identity one of the biggest things that really is like a
Like it sticks out like a giant sore thumb
Is how the gospel john describes the eucharist if you will what the church calls the eucharist or this place in john six
I believe where he talks about chew my flesh that you just read and drink my blood
You do describe the dionysus
You know they would talk about wine being blood and the grape being a blood
so
My question is how the heck could this gospel even be targeting jews in any way
It sounds like a social identity situation where matthew duh
Go to the law sheep of the house of israel
But yeah, we're gonna bring in the gentiles because that's the it keeps like foretelling you like don't worry the times coming
Or the gentiles are gonna be the ones coming and persecution really is coming from the jews
So there could be potential anti-semitic tendencies in matthew
But it definitely is expanding beyond into the gentile world
However jews would never participate or at least orthodox in some sense that we're serious about the Torah
Whatever hear john six and say yeah, i'm cool with this church. Yeah, i'm gonna keep coming back. I mean
It's obvious. This is definitely at a time in the christian church where
They aren't
strictly jewish in their customs it appears
well, um
Two pieces to add to that
As the gospel of the dionysian elements appear in the earliest version of the gospel of john
And then there are two later
Resensions of it the second one i call the anti- jewish gospel
It's no longer as in the synoptic sending q and in the dionysian gospel
that the
Problem is the Pharisees
And the chief priests
Now it's the jews themselves who are the children of the devil
And so it's a rejection of the jews
In the strongest terms
But even with the dionysian gospel other scholars have noted
That the author goes out of his way to describe
The most rudimentary language in customs of jews
So for example
The word, um christus is uh translated as the messiah
now, um
Or um, yeah, so that you'd have to
Do
As if they needed a translation or the word rabbi meaning teacher
Now what jew wouldn't know that a rabbi is a teacher
Or frequently the festivals are called festivals of the jews or the customary burial practices by the jews
And it's clear that the author has
I think the author has jews in mind as part of the audience
But that is not exclusive. There are other things. There's there are other readers
That seem to know very little about judaism
And uh, I would think that it could include devotees of dionysus. By the way, one other issue
The fourth gospel probably comes from western asia minor and we know that western asia minor had
Several cult sites related to dionysus
Including springs that apparently issued forth not only water but blood at certain times
so, um
the the context is
jewish to some extent to be sure
But it also must have included gentiles
Fun fact before we move forward. Um, I just listened to dr. Bart airman yesterday on alive actually on the same channel you were on
with daggers squad
garfield and
He mentioned a point of trying to figure out like what version of judaism did this or that and I thought it was interesting to hear
Dr. Airman say that there were josephus accounts six thousand Pharisees and
scholarly consensus
estimations of jews in existence in the first century
Anywhere will approximately six million but anywhere from five to seven million
if five to seven million jews are on planet earth
and
Only six thousand of them are Pharisee and that was the largest sect of judaism
That tells you how many Hellenistic jews are out there that are probably open minded
To the very things that you're discussing here today or at least potentially not strictly
Closed off to those concepts
And so I just say that to say it's it's very likely you're right that the audience could be also
Including Hellenistic jews not of course. He's not aiming at Pharisees most likely
You know Sadducees and Pharisees extremely religious jews. They're not going to want this but
A Hellenized jew might see this ago. You know what? Yeah, I know about Dionysus. Oh, I like I like this picture
This is cool. There's no telling but that might be the case. Anyway, let's go back to western asia minor
how many
Semitic speaking jews are there going to be in
Ephesus and Smyrna and
Western asia minor
They're almost all going to be Hellenistic jews and in this case, it's not just jews. It's also Gentiles
So we should not be surprised
That some 50 years after the destruction of Jerusalem in western asia minor
Um the people who have a religion that comes out of Judaism are reaching out to
people of other religions
Thank you. Dr. McDonald. I appreciate it
So let's go now to the prologue that you mentioned. All right
Um, I want to introduce it though by starting with the bakai of Euripides
And I just want to give a very quick thumbnail sketch of the
Top the
Narrative structure of the bakai
And we'll go from there and go to the opening monologue
Pretend that you're in
a theater
in western asia minor
And you're there to see Euripides bakai
The first character to step out on stage is disguised as a priest, but it's the god himself
Who's going to tell the audience why he came to his birthplace thebes?
In order to punish it
It's because they denied that his mother semily had sired him from Zeus
And that's why he took this
form
He comes to thebes from
Lydia
With the lydian women who serve as the chorus of the tragedy
And his first act in getting to thebes was to drive the women mad
And of course the god of wine is also a god of madness
Right because of the effects of wine
Right and the women go out into the wild to worship him
And while they're out there, he allows them to do
marvelous feats including
Sparragmast the
The ripping up of wild animals
He supplies them water from rocks like moses does
But also
He supplies them wine when they're out there in the wilderness
And king pentheus and by the way his name means suffering one
uh king pentheus
Thinks this is an outrage and he wants to round up these mine ads these maddened women
In the wilderness
And he also wants to punish this priest
That is Dionysus himself
So he rounds up some of the women puts them in jail and an earthquake frees them
And so then he sends
um
his soldiers out to get Dionysus and Dionysus comes and
Has an interrogation and pentheus says he's going to put him in prison for a bit and then he's going to kill him
Well, there's another earthquake that happens and Dionysus frees himself
But he doesn't flee he come he talks to pentheus and he says
Look, i'm not going anywhere and if you want my advice
You ought not as a mortal kick against the goads a mortal against a god
That line is quoted in the acts of the apostles
When paul and sylas have a prison break because of a an earthquake that story surely is modeled after the bakai
well, um
Then odyssey then Dionysus drives pentheus crazy
and he encourages him to um dress like a woman
And to join him out in the wild to spy on these women that are out in the wild
Worshiping the deity in their orgies and the word orgy is used in in the bakai
So, um
Dionysus then is crazed himself
so they go out to the wilderness and um
Dionysus and pentheus says yeah, I can't see these women very well. Uh, can you put me on top of a tree?
So Dionysus bends a pine tree down and puts
Pentheus on top of it and then returns it to upright
By the way, this is the the luke uses this as the story for zakius
Who's up on a tree and looks down on jesus and not only does he see but he's seen
Well, let's go back to the bakai
the women see
Um, the king addressed his woman up on top of this tree. They recognize who he is
And they uproot the tree
And they dismember him
But they dismember him and this is the spargmast. They dismember him
thinking though that he's actually a lion when they go to to kill him
And agave puts the head of her husband her son
On a thursus that is an ivy wand
And triumphantly brings the head back into thebes
boasting that Dionysus had helped her kill this lion
Well, she soon realizes that she's killed her own son
and Dionysus then comes out of um off of the
machina the um the machine and uh tells
Cadmus and agave the mother and all of the house of Pentheus to leave Thebes
And the point of the story is you don't mess
with Dionysus
um and at the heart of it is
His if you will
birth by a deity and immortal
And of course, this is an issue in the gospels of jesus being the son of god by immortal
So that's the story of um the bakai
Now, um, I'm gonna let you ask a question
about that, but then we're going to
Do the opening monologue?
And I'll pretend that i'm Dionysus himself in a mask
Telling the you the audience why I came to Thebes and am causing such a a turmoil
And when we're done with that
We're going to do some uh comparison of that with the opening speech in um the gospel of john
First I want to say
I don't know if you guys can tell this is obviously really heavy stuff
And I really love the story parallels and stuff
So go down in the description make sure you get the Dionysus gospel
It's a real pretty book too on the front half of its Dionysus's face half of its jesus
It's a really really pretty book and it's really fun to read
Um, I wanted to ask one thing and we'll move on and you don't have to even dig deep
I just maybe you can make a brief comment about it
Then we can continue because we have so much to cover you mentioned moses
knocking water out of a rock in the wilderness
Sounds to me that this uh Dionysus
Story and tradition goes as far back that even potentially the moses story is borrowing from Dionysus potentially
The origins of the Dionysian religion
Already are transparent by the time of Homer which would be at the latest the mid-7th century bce
And we know that these stories in the pentateuch were written after that
Now, um, unfortunately, we don't have any literary evidence before
Euripides in the 5th century bce
of
The the striking of rocks and water produced, but that is still earlier than
Most scholars would say for the pentateuch so that it's not impossible that you have
Such links now, but I want to raise a larger methodological question
When people see parallels between the jewish bible and greek mythology
There's a tendency in some cases to say that the greeks are borrowing from the jews
Or the jews are borrowing from the greeks
And the truth is they're borrowing from each other and from probably unknown cultural forces
So that it's instead of talking about a direction of dependence
In this case, you would say the dinesian
You're suggesting the dinesian cult to the moses cult
It's more likely that we've got some kind of symbiosis
Of um of cultural exchange going both directions
There are some wonderful classicists who has worked on these things
Actually, I'm going to give you one other example that is just
Incredible and I still have not seen a scholar of jewish scripture deal with it
In the odyssey, there's a wonderful passage
tragic passage where
Odysseus and his men are trapped on an island and they can't go any further
To get home
And odysseus goes off by himself to pray to the gods for good weather
His crew down below
Decide even though we're not supposed to kill these cattle sacred to
Helios
We're going to uh, we're starving
So we'll kill some of these cattle and we'll roast them
And um, then when we get home to ithica, we'll give
sacrifices to the gods
In recompense because there's no death worse than starvation
So, um, they roast these cattle
Odysseus wakes up comes back and he smells the roasted
meat
And he knows that they've what they've done
And he's heartbroken and because of that
Because of what they've done
The crew cannot get back home to ithica. They all get drowned in the sea
Moses goes up on Mount Sinai to get the law
He leaves behind the 12 tribes
They have a golden calf
That they created
And he comes back in his outraged at Aaron and others
For what they've done
And it's because of that act that they can't get into the promised land
Now those parallels are just
Amazing wow and and in this case the the story in the odyssey
Surely is older than the one that we have
as the central as a central story in the
The Jewish epic the biblical epic
Now I challenge, uh, I don't know the direction of those parallels
But I certainly think it's worth a good dissertation
From the Hebrew Bible scholar to explore those parallels and by the way the parallels go on beyond that
I've written it up myself just as a way of talking about potential
Um literary influence, but those parallels are really quite striking
Very powerful dr. McDonald. Thank you so much
Yeah, well, let's go back to the Bacchai
And I'm going to pretend that I'm Dionysus coming out on stage
with a mask
And I'm going to tell you as the audience
Things that nobody inside the play except Dionysus himself knows
And this sets up dramatic irony
That the audience knows things that nobody else knows
And um
So that then you have the unfolding of the story
And what Dionysus says in his opening monologue comes to pass
I
The child of Zeus have come to the land of Thebes
Dionysus, who's semily daughter of Cadmus once bore
Induced to do so by a lightning bolt
Having changed myself into human form
From that of a god
I see the tomb of my lightning struck mother
hear the
Hear near the homes and ruins of her halls smoldering with Zeus's unquenchable flame of fire
Hera's hubris against my mother is undying
But I praise Cadmus who established this plot untrodden a sacred precinct for his daughter semily
With clustering foliage of the grapevine. I myself is shrouded it
On leaving the gold rich fields of the Lydians the Phrygians the sunlit plains of the persians
Spectrean walled cities
And the dangerous lands of the Medes arriving at prosperous arabia and all of Asia that lies by the briny sea
That has cities with beautiful towers filled with the mixture of Greeks and barbarians together
I've now come to the land of the Greeks for the first time
After having made those regions dance and having established my rights
So that a god might be revealed to mortals
Of the cities of Greece Thebes was the first one that I started to ululate that is to um
For women to mourn
Having clothed the women in fawnskin and placed the thersis in their hands my ivy'd spear
By the way, the the thersis is a a wand that has a pinecove at the top that probably is a symbolic of a phallus
Since my mother's sisters whom one might least expect were saying that Dionysus was not born from Zeus
But that semily had been seduced by some mortal man
And that she had attributed to Zeus her own sexual sin
The pregnancy by Zeus
Being a sophistry by her father cadmus
On account of this they gloated publicly that Zeus killed her because she lied about the marriage
For this reason I drove the women from their homes
They dwelled in the mountains frenzied in mind. I forced them to take the tokens of my revelry
All the cadmium female seed as many women as there were I drove from their houses in madness
Mingling together with the daughters of cadmus. They sit on rocks under the open sky and under green furs
Whether it wants to or not this city must learn the truth
Though now it is ignorant of my bachic rites
I will give a defense on behalf of my mother semily
By appearing to mortals as the god she bore to Zeus
That's the end of a major section
Next Dionysus notifies the audience why he assumed the guise of a mortal
It's because the king of thebes pentheus god fights against me
Bars me from libations. He never remembers me in his prayers
For this reason I will show him that I am a god and all the thebans too
And into some other land once I have said things right here. I will travel by foot and reveal myself
To this end I have changed into this mortal appearance and transformed my shape into the form of a man
At the end of this speech Dionysus addresses the chorus the lydian women or mine ads crazed women
whom he calls his theasos
or
band of female groupies
quote
You who have left mount tamolus defender of lydia my theasos women whom
From the barbarians I have brought here and as my comrades in camp in march
Take up the instrument native to the region of the phrygians the tambourine
So that's all I want to read from
The opening monologue it actually goes on
And I'm actually
Not happy that it had to be so long for your viewers
Because it's hard to absorb such a long piece of text
But we're going to revisit it when we look at the johannin prologue
And I think it'll make more sense
To have gone through that monologue
Before going through the parallels
So Derek you have the parallels in front of you it looks like yes
And you can see some text boxes that we're going to get to right now
And as we've done in the past i'll read the left hand box
And you read the right hand box
Sounds good
Okay, so i'll be reading from the opening monologue of dianisus which we've already seen
And you're going to read from the beginning of the gospel of jah
I the child of zoos have come to the land of thebes dianisus
Whom semily daughter of cadmus once bore
Induced to do so by a lightning bolt after having my changed having changed myself into human form
from that of a god
In the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god
And the logos was a god
This one at the beginning was with god and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not overcome it
The logos became flesh in verse 14
Both works then single out a particularly exemplary mortal
I praise cadmus who established this plot untrodden
A sacred precinct for his mother
With clustering foliage of the grapevine. I myself have shrouded it
There was a person sent from god whose name was john
And continue next page
This one came as a witness to bear witness about the light so that all might believe through him
Both works then reveal to the audience or readers that the divinity was rejected by his own people
I now have come to the land of greeks for the first time so that a god might be revealed to mortals
Since my mother's sisters whom one might least expect were saying that dianisus was not born from zoos
But that semilee had been seduced by some mortal man and that she had attributed to zoos her own sexual sin
I will give my defense on behalf of my mother semilee by appearing to mortals as the god she bore to zoos
He was in the world and the world came into being through him and the world did not know him
He came to his own regions and his own people did not receive him
Later in the dianis and gospel people will question jesus paternity
And the logos became flesh and pitched tent among us
And we observed his glory glory of the one of a kind child from the father
Full of grace and truth for we all have received of his fullness gift after gift
Whereas dianisus came to thieves to thieves to punish its disbelief
The logos came to earth as its savior
But both were rejected by their own people
The thebans rejected dianisus
And jews rejected jesus
In the tragedy dianisus says he's come to thieves because it's king pentheus
god fights against me
Bars me from libations and never remembers me in his prayers
For this reason i will show him that i'm a god and all the thebans too
To this end i've changed into this mortal appearance and transformed my shape
Into the form of a man
john 118
No one ever has seen god
A one of a kind god the one in the womb of the father that one revealed him
In this translation of john i've translated the greek expression
tan colpan
to patrice
As the womb of the father
Although other translations are possible
The ironic expression in john's prologue that his fathers don't have wombs
Evokes dianisus's birth from the thigh womb of zeus
Here is euripides description of zeus's rescue of dianisus's fetus from the womb
Of dying semily as intoned by the female chorus
quote
immediately as into a child's bed
zeus son of chronos
hid him in his thigh
And closed it up with golden pins hidden from hara
And he birthed him as soon as the fates had brought him to term
ancient artists frequently depicted a baby
Dianisus coming out of the thigh
Of zeus as though from a womb
So in a sense zeus is both father and mother to dianisus
And that's why you have this jesus the only one born from the womb of the father
In the gospel of john
Now one could say dianis. This is just a far-fetched parallel
You're going to have certain kinds of
Discourses
Frequently in ancient religion, you know, god's coming to earth being vilified
Coming to people that don't
Recognize him and so on. Yes, that's true
But what I want to show you now is we have
unmistakable
Deniable evidence
That ancient readers saw the similarities between this opening monologue, which was famous
And the prologue to the gospel of john
And the best example we have from an early period comes from clement of alexandria
clement is writing around the year
200 and he wrote a book called the protrepticus
That is I an address to pagans
Encouraging to come to christ and to leave pagan religion
And in the passage that we're going to read
I want to have you read the numbers that are in square brackets
And the those numbers indicate the line
in
the bakai
Where you have a corresponding element
so here
Christ is directly addressing dianisus
And he's telling dianisus he should convert to him
The first word in this paragraph is iki
That is come that is the first word in the bakai
so
It'll be like this
Come forget about iki come and then you're going to say one
Okay, right and so that's the first line of the bakai
come
one
Oh madman not propped up by a thyrsis
25
Not wreathed with ivy 25
Throw off your headband throw off your fond skin
24
Get sober
I will show you the logos and the mysteries of the logos and I will describe them with your own imagery
the mountain
33
Is beloved of god and is not subject to tragedies
Like kitharan a mountain prominent in the bakai, but exalted by true dramas of truth
A sober mountain and shaded by chased woods 38
Revelling here are no mine ads 52
Daughters of thunder stricken semily six
Initiates in the disgusting distribution of raw flesh 139
Instead they are the daughters of god
The beautiful lambs who utter this solemn orgies
34
Of the logos and gather together a sober chorus
This chorus consists of the righteous and their song is a kim to the king of all
Young girls pluck their instruments 58 to 59
angels sing praises
prophets speak
The sound of music carries
Quickly they follow the theosis 56
Those who are called scurry off longing to welcome the father
Um three through four
Isn't that astonishing? That's a lot. Yeah
And here christ is directly addressing
Dionysus using images from Euripides bakai
Clement has the
opening passage of the bakai in front of him
And sees the similarities to the
To the logos and the opening speech in the gospel of john
If we ever needed a smoking gun
For somebody early on recognizing parallels between john and the bakai. This has got to be it
Wow
This is so interesting dr. McDonald. You know
There's a study done by some of the scholars who want to talk about for example, um paul within judaism
And i'm not trying to shift topics because it's actually kind of it could potentially be in this vein
And a lot of them suggest that paul when he's talking about these
Archons and these demons or these these really daemons, which are not just demons or spirits, but they're like
lowercase gods
He feels like he's competing with other gods and that the god of israel or his god is potentially in his christ is
Going to defeat these other gods. I wonder and i'm just speculating here. I wonder if
One of the competitive deities that the cults that paul's bumping into are dionysus
And I just speculate. I mean, obviously the johanna tradition is clearly literally
Showing a mimetic connection
But I wonder if paul being the basis for many of these gospels that get developed
Is already bumping into these sects and he's not only promising salvation and that don't worry
I'm gonna my god's gonna protect you from your gods
As you convert
But also your god's going to convert in the end every knee shall bow including your deity
So I wonder if that's something that that goes into the vein of what you're suggesting here
I wouldn't be at all surprised
The problem is that we don't have the same kind of evidence that we have in these cases
so um
The fact that paul is himself heavily involved in mission in western asia minor
Means that he's going to be traveling in the same circles as the author of the fourth gospel
and
Again paul is concerned with offerings of eternal life
The central act of the christian memory is going to be the eucharist
And so I wouldn't be surprised that you and by the way you also have maddened women in carth
That some have identified as being similar to mine ads so I wouldn't be surprised
Thank you
Now I want to give one more example
And this one is
Transparent
Unfortunately, it's a millennium after clement of alexandria
But um, it shows that in the history of scholarship
people saw similarities between the fourth gospel and urippity's bakai
and
Visually had access to the bakai and to the gospel of john in rewriting the
The story about jesus
This is a document that's called in latin the christus patiens or we would say the suffering christ
And i'm going to read the very opening of it to you
And then i'm going to read an extended passage
And i'm assuming at some point maybe your viewers will see this on screen so that they can follow along with us
But here's how the poem begins
Since you have listened to poems with a pious ear
And seek to hear now pious things but in a poet's way
Give heed for now as would urippity's
I shall tell of a passion that redeemed the world
Here you will find the mysteries
Think dainesean mysteries
fully told
For they come from the mouth of a maid and a virgin mother
And the initiate beloved of his teacher that is the beloved disciple
The disciple in the gospel of john
And these are my drama's roles
The ever holy mother
That is the theotokos mary
The chaste initiate
That is john the evangelist
And the attendant maidens of the mother of the lord that is mine ads
So now christus patiens is
Is going to tell you he's telling you he's writing a poem based on the bakai
urippity's and the mine ads and so on
It's astonishing now i'm going to
Read
Not the beginning of the christus patiens, which we've just done but a long passage near the end of it
Now once the text is put up on the screen your viewers will see that each line is
Introduced with
Evoking a line from the bakai almost all of it from the opening monologue
And the context is this
Mary has learned that her son
Jesus is dead
And whereas the gospels are silent about mary's morning
um Byzantine uh poetry and and uh pros
Filled in her lamentations by using the laments of ancient women
Most of the time it's the laments of hecuba or androma andromache
And helen for the death of hector
But in this case
She's that mary is
morning jesus
More like agave would have in the bakai
And is using the introductory monologue
To retell the story of why jesus was important and the echoes of the prologue in the gospel of john are going to be transparent
Talking about the logos or
Taking flesh or having a disputed paternity
This is really quite remarkable
And my guess is that none of your viewers has ever considered
This as a part of the interpretive tradition of the gospel of john
So she's addressing the corpse of her dead son jesus
Although you remain god you join the nature of man to your own form
This is bakai 52 and 54
You joined the nature of mortals
To the form of god
again
the bakai
I gave you birth
But still was a pure virgin
Having come from god you took human form
But your mother's kindred whom you might least expect that is jews
Since you perform many amazing feats for them these people were saying that you were not a savior born from god
But that i had been seduced by a mortal man
Bore you out of wedlock lied about the marriage and foisted my sexual sins on to god
And now they have lawlessly sped to kill you out of jealousy
And by a stratagem of the enemy through those murders
Uh, sorry through those murderers
You will make your friends dance and establish your mysteries so that you might be revealed to mortals
As it is revealed to all in heaven
And into some other land once you have revealed yourself here you will lift up your might
Whether it wants to or not this city must learn the truth
Though now it is ignorant of your mysteries
So also in every other habitation of earth-born people that god fights against you
Bars you from libations and never remembers you in prayers
Those are all lines from the bakai
For this reason reveal to them that you are god
And reveal yourself everywhere
And if you want in wrath to expel the race of the jews from this land with arms
For i see the punishment of your life producing fate
Fire near their houses and ruins of their mansions already burning
An unquenchable flame of fire
The immortal city of god punished for its hubris
I praise this judgment that makes this land untrodden by all those who murdered you oh child
Who left the cities in lydia praised by all and fridgia and some that plains of persia
Backed green walled cities and the hard to conquer lands of media
Bypassing prosperous arabia peoples far away and plunged in darkness and all of age of the
Lies by the briny sea that has cities with beautiful towers
Filled with the mixture of greeks and barbarians together
You came the at first to the land of the hebrus that placed you in a tomb a corpse from slaughter
But you women who have left the land of gillia my gillian
Degele my theasos who traveled with me from here initiates of the mysteries of the wound
Alas the corpse is placed in the tomb
That's the end of her lament where she invites other women to come and mourn
There can't be any doubt that the author
Sees in the opening speech of obakai
An opportunity to portray jesus as a new dionysus
Wow
I mean that's that was shocking in terms of comparison. That was really really blunt
I got a few questions. I guess just to kind of put the context here
Couple places it talks about the hebrus and jews in this and you have the reference bakai here
Is that the 12th century work that is saying jews and hebrus or is that
In the original bakai, you know, that's that's that's the christian 12th century. Okay, okay
Well, it's just fascinating because the literary construct is so similar
Um to what to what the actual bakai is saying
Any I mean, obviously I ask everyone to go read the bakai and and see for yourself
Nothing is identical, but these phrases right here very very close and well in in greek
Many of them are identical
Wow, of course, this is my own translation
But um, if you if why were you could put the greek line of from the bakai
Next to the the line in the christus fadians and more often they're not they're identical
What about in john what about in john, I know there's some greek
literary parallels that
You know, there's a suggested memetic genetic connection if you will showing that hey, this is definitely lifted
In your book you go into that by the way, so
Um, there are some examples, but there really are not very many that the parallels are more thematic
They have to do with characterization and similar episodes
But next time we'll talk more about these. Okay, and uh, all I try to identify the verbal similarities and there are some
Okay, but for example when jesus goes to the city of the samaritans
It's a woman
outside the city
that wants to talk religion
And jesus offers her water out in the wilderness, but this is living water
Um
I mean the parallels really go on and on it's quite remarkable
On all the men that she's married. I mean you gotta imagine she's wild and out isn't she
She's definitely having a lot of too much fun. She sounds like a mine ad. Um, so
I got a question then because something you brought up earlier. I thought was very interesting was that mary
You know or the accusation of jesus's mother
You know is brought up in john is that brought up in the other gospels and
It's obviously brought up here
What is the accusation going on here?
And we could obviously go into this in more depth some of these parallels that I think we could zoom into
I just think that's quite interesting
That everyone's mocking jesus's paternal, you know situation like dude. You're just a guy
Born over here. You're not anything important
And I think it's fascinating looking at that how people like kelsus in the second century
Are trying to say well this jesus was born of a roman soldier who went and slept with mary and you know
What was the name of his uh claim that his father was up?
Pantera or something pantera. Yeah
Yeah, so does that play any role into this fiction and is kelsus taking things out of context to argue a polemic against jesus
You know what's going on in the gospel there
Well paul and the author of the gospel of mark and the author of q as far as we can tell
Had no notion of a divine paternity for jesus that involved any kind of insemination
in
Matthew and luke we get the first rumblings that this would be an embarrassment
For mary before she was married to have
Become pregnant then it becomes a really big issue in the so-called proto gospel of james
And this is really a very interesting
Text that we could talk about at a later time
The um, I haven't mentioned the gospel of nicodemus
Most of your viewers probably have never heard of the gospel of nicodemus. It actually came out in
several different
Resentions the first of which probably was late fourth century and it goes all the way to the ninth or tenth century in its various
Resentions and it was very popular in europe sometimes used
in
the in holy week and
So there's some reason to think that in incited violence against jews during holy week because it blames jews for the death of jesus
but
I mentioned here
For two reasons
First of all
the author
Over and over again makes the questionable paternity of jesus an issue
between himself and
The jewish opponents
But even more important is that the earliest version of the gospel of nicodemus and of course nicodemus only appears in the fourth gospel
So that tells you something about the fourth gospel's influence on this text
But over and over again it imitates the bakai on its own
So that this is yet another
Christian retelling of the story of jesus that uses the bakai as a primary text
And in my synopsis of the gospel of john i have an appendix
That goes through the gospel of nicodemus and shows this dependence on the bakai
so the bakai was
extremely important as a definitive
Statement not only of dainese in religion, but it became
stereotyped about
pagan religion generally
And because the Dionysus in the story is so unforgiving and punitive
And it makes jesus really look quite quite like a pacifist and a nice guy
I want to emphasize though
One more time
That the reason that the fourth gospel is so interested in portraying jesus as a Dionysus character
Is not to win over converts
It's to tell the christian community
That jesus like Dionysus gives gifts
including
wine
at a wedding
And of course a wedding is a celebration of sexual
Contact and sex
And wine is
It gives joy
In celebration
Jesus gives eternal life to those who eat his flesh and drink his blood
He gives mania mission so that there's a famous speech about jesus giving
Eleutheria
freedom to those who
The the truth will make you free
so that this
Jesus of the gospel of john
Is a much better neighbor
Than jesus of the synoptics who asks you to mow the lawn all the time
This the dine the Dionysus of the gospel the jesus of the gospel of john brings your brownies
I
Yeah, I like I like the gospel of john jesus to trust me. I like that one. In fact, it sounds like we're getting and this is why the whole um
Getting into the social
You know structure of these gospels are quite interesting especially when you get further back
Yeah, and let me ask you this real quick before we go because I know ax does the same thing in a lot of ways
I mean even like
Axe the author of ax has paul continuously reminding people. He's the son of david like
This this this line of david is very important and there's some interesting reasons why
In the bakai and of course comparing memetic connections to the old testament why that's important, but um
They're really brilliant in the way that luke or the author of luke is you know
Doing this um
What I think is interesting and maybe I can ask is is there a hint at maybe potential accuracy historically speaking even though
We know ax is fictional
Historically speaking to the most primitive q sect of judaism or q sect of judaism slash christianity
Do we see some truth maybe in ax and talking about this is a um
This was a communistic community that you know was very poor and everyone owned
You know there was no belongings to an individual but to a collective community
That evidence that we see in ax does that point to a q community of christianity? Do you think there's accuracy there?
No, I don't but let me tell you why it's a good question
Um luke inherits from the q document
A great deal of material that's concerned about the poor
Blessed are you poor for years of the kingdom of heaven and in the beatitudes and so on
and luke
Has his own agenda about
The poor and the distribution of wealth and he's coming from an elitist
He's telling other elitist people with means that they should give
Money to the poor in the same way that the roman empire gives out doles to
The poor and others as a part of its social outreach programs if you want to say it that way
But these two summaries that we have at the ax in the beginning of the ax of the apostles
almost certainly are
coming from plateaus republic
and the
instructions that
Socrates gives to the guardians of
The city especially Athens that they are not to own any silver or gold
That because as we know in american politics money corrupts
So if they don't have anything to gain financially from their
Um
The decisions they'll be
More just in terms of the laws that are needed for Athens
one of my students wrote a wonderful dissertation on
imitations of
The of those passages in plateaus republic
That talk about not having any need and in that case you actually have overlapping vocabulary
And so on so he's more interested in showing that
in terms of
plateaus and isocrates is
Ideal community the early church was an example of it
And that the roman empire could take a lesson in how to care for its poor if it similarly
Um took care of people so that no one was in need
Okay, um
I guess last statement question and you don't even have to really dig deep on answering this
There's a wonderful book uh that I started recently and it really reminded me of you and your work because he was influenced by you
um, this gentleman was actually on um
He was on Joe Rogan's podcast
A month month and a half ago, and I think it's amazing that people are taking your works
It may not be the guild
The guild is so like hesitant to follow you, but i'm so thankful for guys like this
Even if you don't let's just say I don't think you've read his work yet
I would love to hear your view on it at some point
But i'm so inspired by people who take what you're writing and try to see
And stretch and see hey, is there something here?
And the name of it is the immortality key
By brian c
Moralescu I try to pronounce that correct moralescu is pretty much how it is looks in english and um
And in the the beginning of it graham handcock makes a statement about how he's an atheist
but he has taken trips to south america and he's
Tried these ayahuasca ceremonies and things and he just said you know it expanded my consciousness as an atheist who doesn't believe in any gods
It did make me see that there's something maybe more to just reality
You know and just amazing things it kind of sounded very optimistic
And this man brian has been influenced by your works in many ways to try and see if there was an agape feast
In the second century church father equates that agape feast with the eucharist and that this this um
this emphasis
Feast that sometimes included orgies, uh, you know coming from things like dianneis and colt and things like that where they
Would have these orgies um
There may be some overlap between the the early pagan christian
Feast of the eucharist and this agape feast
And I think there may be some literary connections, but I just wanted to know have you read or heard of this work in any length
And if not, uh, then there's really not too much to comment on other than maybe
I would love to have a show one day where you and brian can maybe hang out
Uh, but first of course you'd have to get acquainted with his work
But I think that would be an excellent show and I know a ton of people would want to tune into that kind of show
But uh, have you heard of it? Um, yes, I have because he actually contacted me
um, and we've exchanged emails and I actually
He offered to send me a copy of his book and he hasn't done so yet
So I hope he's listening and can send me that copy of the book
um, and I think it it looks to me like it's very well researched
and uh, carefully drawn
So I'm with but I'm not going to comment on the scholarship
Of course until I see the book, but I do want to say one thing for your viewers. Yes, sir
It is not by accident
that ancient religious ceremonies
included
mine bending substances
And the fact that in the dinesian cult you have the ingestion of wine
In the christian eucharist you have the ingestion of wine
At elusis you have the ingestion of a kind of beer that seems to have been a barley beer
that was um
fermented and
People drank before they had the the initiation
In order to help them get dreams
you have um wine as a part of
Jewish festivities
um
And you have the in native american peyote cults and around the world you have
mind bending drugs
You have it in in the odyssey also by the way
Um, you have mind bending drugs that are used in for religious purposes
so, um
It's ironic. I think that in some forms of modern christianity. There's this aversion
To any kind of substance that would be mind bending
Now i'm not a fan of mind bending drugs or um overuse of alcohol or things like that
But I think we would be naive to think that ancient religion
was purged of such mind bending
or expanding drugs
And I don't know that I would be in a position to say that they couldn't be beneficial
Yeah, no, no, no. I'm with you. Yeah, they could be beneficial or they wouldn't be sustained. I don't think
I'm with you 100 and some people just don't know how to act uh like me
Which is why I just don't do it. Um, I've had my fair share
But I can respect people who do and they know how to wake up in the morning and they do their
They do their normal work and it's like a once in a while way of
Enjoying oneself, but in the ancient world it was deeper than just an enjoyment. I think they they the religious slash pleasure
Was kind of a combined
thing whereas today
people can just go wild and not actually
Connect the ceremonial practices with their typical daily
Drinking or whatever it might be. So
Yeah, I'm with you. I think that that's a whole different discussion even but
I want to say one more thing. I want to say yeah
The first time I got drunk was at a jewish satyr with too much mogan david red wine
So, uh, this is this is now I don't make a habit of that problem
And I know you've had your issues with it
but um
But you know, we all lot to learn that
In some religious festivities including weddings
Um, wine is a part of the joy of life
Look, I can I have some wonderful memories. Okay, I have I'm with you 100 percent
I have had some wonderful memories. I just did not have any moderation and I just could not
Continue doing it. It was harming me more than it was helping me and my hat
Literally off to everyone who knows how to enjoy these festivities and to enjoy life to its max potential
I encourage people to enjoy these things
I just say for those of you who self destruct like me who don't know how to act and you realize this is actually killing me
Uh, yeah, give me a ring if you want help with those things
But as far as I'm concerned, you know, there are some wonderful things to explore in that and I'd like to contact brian
Medescu and see if I can't hook you and him up dr. McDonald. Would you be interested in something like that? Oh, yeah, they'd be fun
Yeah, awesome. Well, dr. McDonald. Thank you for joining me today and teaching us
This is the first part to a second part or two-part series. I believe we're gonna make it two parts
We might you never know have a third little squeeze of the grape juice if you are the blood if you will out of this thing
But for sure we have a second part coming and I really do appreciate it ladies and gentlemen go down in the description
Get the die nice and gospel you you literally have if you want eternal life, okay?
You must eat of his book and drink of his words out of the pages of that book in order to achieve
Eternal life. You'll never die if you do such a thing. Um, no, seriously
I really want to hear your thoughts of this book and of this show down in the description
Like this video. Don't forget that help my audience or help my guests that I bring on
By getting their works it helps them want to come on the myth vision and to give you guys this free insight
I really really appreciate every one of my guests that come on and thank you the audience
Who helps make this possible by getting the books and making this content go out there
We want the world to hear about this and sometimes you won't catch this in the universities
It's just there's a bias in the guild sometimes on
Promoting these concepts and you the viewer can make that possible. So I thank you so much and dr. McDonald
I thank you for taking your time to come on and teach us. Oh, it's a pleasure. Thank you
Yes, sir
And for those of you who want to be initiated into the mysteries of myth vision if you don't know the secret
incantation here it is
we
are
myth vision
You
