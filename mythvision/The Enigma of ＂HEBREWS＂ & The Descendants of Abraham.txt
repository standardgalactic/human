Who wrote the letter to the Hebrews and when was it written? Why in such a high Greek?
I mean the author had to be very intelligent to understand this level of Greek
Also to whom was it written to Jews exclusively or a mixed community of Gentile and Jews in the early Christian movement?
Eventually the identity markers for Israel become applied to people who are both Jew and non-Jew

I have a heavy hitting scholar
I have doctor Harold Attridge with us and he has written a
Hermenea if you will a part of the Hermenea commentary series on the book of Hebrews
Even though I was only a year old when it was published
I'm sure there's much we could cover here and he may have some updated ideas. So stay tuned
Don't forget to like the video join the patreon help support us
I'm looking forward to hearing what dr. Attridge has to say and dr. Attridge if I may is it okay that I call you dr
Attridge or what's the best way to address you?
You can call me Harry. Harry awesome. Okay. I don't want to be
Informal so if I may you have a vast
List if you will for your education you have an AB at Boston College
You have a BA in Emmett Cambridge University in Hebrew University at Jerusalem of Jerusalem a PhD at Harvard University
And was Dean of Yale Divinity School from 2002 to 2012 which I went up there to interview
Dr. Collins the week he was retiring I went up to Yale Divinity and sat in his
Office and took some of his books away with me and everything. So I know what how wonderful the school is up there great staff and everything
Among your publications are the installments of Hermenea commentary series you authored on the epistle to the Hebrews
You also edited Paul Bradshaw's commentary the apostolic tradition in 2002 the late Richard Pervo
my favorite commentary on the book of Acts and
Adele Collins

Nosticism and early Christianity 2005 and the Harper Collins study Bible in 2006
There's so much there
So let's get right into the question this book this epistle that we call Hebrews
Dating I know it's a difficult one
Where do you stand on this and how do we address the dating of this this text?
right well, there's
You know the house is divided the scholar the house is divided on dating Hebrews. There are some people that
Want to see it as a fairly early text so contemporary with the Pauline epistles perhaps dating to the 50s or 60s
Maybe maybe as early as the 50s. I'm more likely the 60s and the main reason for putting it early is the sense that there's
Well the observation first of all that there's no reference to the destruction of the temple which happened in 7080 and you'd think that
a text that's as interested as it is in
Matters of cult and sacrifice might take note of the fact that the temple was no more so
Assuming that it was written before the destruction of the temple is based on that observation
And then there were people however to say well, you know
It does seem to have some sort of relationship to the Pauline corpus, even though it's not written by Paul
Some there's least one scholar who actually thinks it's a pseudopigraphan an attempt to
Portray its its author in some subtle way as Paul himself, but it doesn't make any explicit claims
But it does seem to have some sort of relationship to the Pauline corpus
And so hmm that would seem to push it a little bit later, wouldn't it?
If the Pauline corpus comes into effect sometime after Paul's death probably around 64
so
there is a
range and there's no
Absolute termless
Antiquam that is a date before which the letter has to have been written the one
Bit of information that might be relevant to that and might help to establish some sort of data is is the epistle of Clement of Rome
Which seems to it doesn't actually quote and say the epistle of the Hebrew says
but it uses some of the material that you have in chapter one of Hebrews and
The stuff that you have there in chapter one of Hebrews seems to be a composition of the author of Hebrews
The combination of of texts and the like that you that you have there
So that's reflected in first Clement and so most people think that first Clement knows some version of of Hebrews
And now when his first Clement written
Conventional date is around 95 96, but it could be as late as 110
In any case some place
Around the beginning of the second century there seems to be an awareness of what's going on in Hebrews
So I think the the honest answer to the question is we can't date it with
Certitude we can say there's a range of options from around
16 to around 90 and that's more or less what I said back in my commentary and I haven't changed my mind on that
So this is
Kind of weird I wonder if that's my audio. Sorry. I'm glad that you're
This is no longer your idea or this is and and whenever you have like an updated idea
I'd love to you know have your thoughts about that as well because I know this is dated and a lot of modern scholars might have come in
Maybe you find something that they said was good or I'd love to hear where you where you see the modern scholarship on ideas
That that really appreciate so sometimes I might
Ask just what your opinion is since we can't be dogmatic and to maybe say this is where I would range it personally
versus other scholars if possible, but
Indating I know that's not easy to do so epistle versus sermon
You've indicated that this so-called epistle is more like a sermon than it is a proper letter since it lacks a lot of the features
Of the Pauline and pastoral epistles. Namely the letter is anonymous. Can you elaborate on this?
yeah, if you look at all of the the letters that we have whether they're real letters or
Literary letters they start out in a very conventional way X sends to Y greetings
sometimes those greetings can be
Expanded and sometimes the identification of the sender or the recipients is expanded
But in any case that's usually there in a letter and that just isn't there in Hebrews what you have at the end however
sounds an awful lot like the end of
various kinds of
Pauline especially Pauline letters
and so
This has led a number of people to think that
The end of Hebrews maybe as much as the whole of chapter 13 is an addition to another text
That was added to the text when it was sent around for some purpose or other
so
And I this there's something to be said for that
I think it's a text that was distributed in some way rather like a letter
But in fact if you look at it, it's not addressing problems like for instance first Corinthians is or
Not introducing oneself to a new community like Romans is and going into a lot of
Details on theological issues that might be relevant to that introduction
It's not solving a particular personal problem as Philemon is
it's reflecting on scripture and reflecting on the significance of the Christ event and
Offering what seems to be a new way of thinking about that that event drawing on those scriptural texts and brings it into play
So yeah, that's why I at least and I think many other people see it primarily as a kind of
homiletical text
That may have had some sort of distribution that is
Relevant to the or evident at the end of the the text
I
Can't hear you. I can't hear you
Sorry, I muted myself. I said, thank you so much. I appreciate that and
The style scholars have noted that the Greek style of Hebrews is much more sophisticated than most of the other books in the New Testament
What is the significance of this in terms of social status and level of education of the author and his intended Hellenistic audience and why in the world?
did a tradition from that
This was written by Paul in Greek-speaking East in light of this stark different stark difference in style
You know, let me ask you
Yeah, most of Paul's letters Paul's letters display a certain degree of
Literary sophistication
You know Paul had
Greek rhetoric 101 or something in in Tarsus
but
most of his things are
Most of his letters are addressed to specific issues of as I've already said and
Often they're there in kind of dialogue with the community sees addressing and using the language of that that community to address those issues
This is particularly clear in
in the Corinthian correspondence
and sometimes Paul is is really
You know shooting off
Off the hip if you will as in Galatians when he gets nasty at some points at the same time that he's making arguments
About what he takes to be a fundamental principle
but so there's a kind of casual dimension to the Pauline letters even though there are
elements of literary sophistication
You don't have the same
Thing going on in Hebrews where there's a very elaborate and carefully thought out structure
Where there's word plays all over the place where there's kind of rhythmic speech at some times
It's a quasi poetic and a choice of vocabulary that
Uses hop ox logometer words that appear
only once in in the Pauline corpus or in the New Testament all of which
suggests that this is a
Different kettle of fish in terms of its literary style and people in antiquity
Noted that the most famous example is origin the church father from Alexandria from the late 2nd into the 3rd century
wound up in Caesarea and Palestine
and
he
notes that
The style is very different from what you get in Paul and he says at the end of a well
Paul could have could have said this kind of stuff
But someone else wrote it and God knows who that is
And I think that that pretty much
Is an appropriate bit of evidence that says tells us that even people in antiquity who had some literary training and sophistication
Could recognize that there's a difference in the the register of the language that we get in this text from what you have in the Pauline corpus
Thank you so much
The audience this is where I think we'll elaborate further as time goes on in this discussion. It's a really
Interesting idea to me, especially when you get into the New Testament
There's this elbow in the road of what people like to call Christianity
But there seems to be some debate over whether or not as the title indicates this epistle was actually written to Hebrews meaning a
Jewish Christian audience or whether it was written to Gentiles who were heavenly steeped in Hellenistic to Hellenistic Judaism
Paul constantly refers to the ethnic distinctions among his audience Jews Gentiles
Greeks but the author of Hebrews never mentions anything about Gentiles or Greeks
We'll go over some examples, of course as the show goes on but
Scholars argue that or some if you will why do some scholars argue that Hebrews
Dedicated or directed at Jews only for now
Can you just lay out the groundwork to address this question if you don't mind?
Sure. Well, first of all the title to the Hebrews is is something that's it was given to the text
Probably in the second century by people who are transmitting it and so I think you have a judgment already by
Some early Christians who saved this text and found it valuable that it was being addressed to
To Jews or Jewish Christians if you will I think the main internal
Data that's brought to bear on the question is is is the set of facts having to do with the
the Jewish liturgical cycle and liturgical practice
Particularly the sacrifice of Yom Kippur, but other sacrifices to language of which gets woven into the argument that
plus the
the ways in which scripture is used and cited and
Arguments are based on certain facts about scripture and that parallel arguments that you get in rabbinic texts
Guess a rush a while the use of two texts that share one word
And they build some sort of argument on the basis of a comparison of those texts
Founded on that that shit word. So there are a number of things in the text in terms of its content in terms of its focus
That seemed to suggest to some people. Yeah, it's probably written to
To people who have some connection some important connection with with the Jewish tradition
But here's where the rub is that what kind of connection might it have been?
Is it the connection that?
natural-born Jews have with their tradition and
there's an issue of abandoning that tradition or
Or yearning for
consolation that comes from that tradition
or is it
Written to a community of people who like many in the Pauline orbit and many in other segments of early Christianity
Thought of themselves as joining Israel in some way
whether or not
through
the ritual of circumcision or simply by divine grace being incorporated into the people of God and that's what
What Paul kind of argues that Gentiles can become members of God's select people
without undergoing circumcision
In any case it could well be that you have
people
To whom a letter like Hebrews or a sermon like Hebrews is addressed who have bought into their identity as
heirs of ancient Israel and a concern about the same sort of issues that one might attribute to
Data-born Jews that is a concern for
the effectiveness of
the illiterature practice
a concern for
Whether the death of Christ actually remits sin
And if so how I mean there are theological issues that could come up whether or not
One was born a Jew or not if you buy into the notion that Jesus's death is somehow a sacrifice so
That we really can't tell and my hunch is that it was probably written to
To a kind of mixed community the kind of community that you see in some Pauline letters
All right, the kind of community where you have some native born Jews certainly
But also probably people who are saying yeah, I'm delighted to be now a member of the people of God
And I have these theological issues and let's talk about them. So wow. Yeah, I'm on board
This is really interesting
So the law you note in your commentary to the author of Hebrews and Paul both believe that the mosaic law has somehow
Become obsolete after the sacrificial death of Jesus
But you explain that these authors have slightly different perspectives on this subject. Can you delve into that a little bit?
well, Paul raises the the issue of the relevance of the mosaic Torah primarily in in connection with the
Requirement of circumcision to be a member of the the people of God and
That's not an issue on the table
for Hebrews either it's been resolved and this might be the case if it's
Written say late in the first century and the debates that are
On the table at the time that Paul was was active in the 40s and 50s
Have been resolved and it's no longer an issue worth discussing
So
What Hebrews is interested in then is it's not the issue of circumcision and the relevance of the Torah or as a
kind of
Sinei Quan on of membership and the people of God. No, it's a question of of the the rituals that are
Mandated in Torah particularly the Day of Atonement ritual and all that goes with it and all that's connected with the whole sacrificial cult and
how that is
relevant to the life of people today
in the day when it was written and
Our author is in effect saying that that that whole
way of of
Ritually
connecting with God and ritually dealing with the problems of
Human existence of sin in our lives
All of that is now obsolete
because there's a
new and effective way that God has
brought to bear on the issue of human sin and guilt and that's the the sacrificial death of Christ
And so it's a different set of issues. That's on the table between the Pauline Corpus and thinking about the the Torah and
Hebrews and what it's concerned with
Thank you so much. I appreciate that so
The Diatheke if you will there's this Greek word Diatheke that comes up all the time in Hebrews
And you spend a lot of time in your commentary explaining how this word is used in a different context to refer to either a
Covenant the Old Covenant or a Testament the New Testament. Can you explain this in layman's terms?
Yeah, well
Okay, Diatheke
Can be translated in several ways when we talk about the New Testament a kind a Diatheke
That's the word that's that used but what is a testament? Okay
We tend to think of it
first and foremost in terms of the Torah and the divine revelation that's
given in in the five books of the Pentateuch and Torah
and the relationship between God and his people that's established on Mount Sinai and
Sure enough Hebrews knows all of that and that's part of the mix but Diatheke particularly in
ordinary legal parlance in the Hellenistic world refers to a
a
Testament in a strict sense that is something that someone writes in order to leave an inheritance for one's heirs
and
The the fact that that word can be used in more than one sense
Is apparent not only from Hebrews but also from Paul and Galatians who makes the same kind of play
So this is one of the little little
Connections between part of the Pauline corpus and Hebrews Paul knows the Diatheke can mean a testament in the broad sense or a
Testament of the narrow legal sense of a will okay, and Hebrews exploits that that that possibility
as a
linchpin of
The argument that he that it builds in chapters 8 through 10
and that argument is based
primarily on a
Scriptural text that is Jeremiah
Remember we talked about how Hebrews is a kind of homily that builds on scriptural text and you know does interesting things with them
And what you get in chapters 8 through 10 is in some ways an exposition of the promise that you get in Jeremiah 31 of
God establishing a new covenant with his people
In the context of Jeremiah, that's probably best to be understood as a renewal of the covenant established on Mount Sinai
And not something radically different, but Hebrews is
does its own number on that prophecy and
It's as it in effect is is kind of asking the question subtly asking the question
How how how does this covenant get established and is this covenant?
Really a testament in the narrow sense, and if so, how does it work as a testament or how is it that a testament can establish a covenant?
If to take the two poles of the the the sense of this this word, do you think okay?
And so that's what Hebrews is is up to I think in chapters 8 through 10. This is okay. We have this prophecy
And it's been playing all along
Hebrews is is one of these cases where you see that there's a clever author
Involved here, and he's really thinking about how he's going to deliver this message
He's thrown out the the language of inheritance at the beginning of the the epistle back there in chapter 1 and so
If the sensitive
Reader of the sensitive hearer of this homily might be alerted by that fact to the notion that inheritance is going to play a role here
And what Hebrews is going to be telling us and sure enough
it it does as
As we get into chapter 9
Which is the at the central point of the exposition of the meaning of Jeremiah's prophecy
We have Hebrews using the term Diathak, which had been used in Jeremiah's prophecy
But using it in a way that evokes the technical
Legal sense of a last will and testament because he says a testament is not valid until the testator dies
Right, and that's something that only applies to a a will
Doesn't apply to the covenant that God made with Israel because God didn't die, right?
so
But who someone died who died Jesus died and Jesus left an inheritance to his people
Through the Diathak a
The testament that he gave and how was that testament?
Established, huh?
Hebrews then throws in another scriptural text
You got a question scripture answers it he's like and the
The scriptural text that he cites is the establishment of the first covenant, but which was done by the sprinkling of blood
On the tablets of the law and the people
That it is referred to an exodus and that text is cited in chapter 9 right right after we've talked about
They the business about a covenant being
Dependent upon the death of the testator okay or a testament covenant being dependent on the testator so this
Testament and this covenant was established by the death of Christ
when his blood got sprinkled on
On everything okay
And a little later on we'll come back to the sprinkling business in chapter 10 where there's an allusion to the baptismal ritual and sprinkling with
Clean water and cleansing with what so that's all tied in with the Christian ritual life
okay, so
We have the notion established in chapter 9 that the death of Jesus is something that
Makes possible the reading of a will
And Jeremiah's prophecy by the way said that this new covenant would be written not on
Ordinary materials, but in the hearts of those with whom the covenant was being being established and how does that happen?
Hebrews answers that question in effect by saying it happens
through the example of Christ and
How does that example work chapter 10 the next stage of the exposition of the
the covenant language of
Covenant Testament language of Jeremiah
Brings in another scriptural text Psalm 45
Which is put on the lips of Jesus
saying
Sacrifice you did not want
But I have come to do your will of God
and
Hebrews then summarizes all of the
Clever
Exegetical moves that he's been making by saying by that have we been sanctified
Also have notions of perfection. That's another matter, but in any case it's all brought together
in this this notion that the death of Jesus is a way in which a
Testament is concluded and made valid that has an
Inheritance in it and that inheritance is what's written on our hearts by the example of Jesus in his fidelity to God
And that then serves as the basis for they they concluding part of Hebrews
Especially chapter 11, which is this long exposition this roster of examples of fidelity
culminating in Christ
To whom we have to look
And whom we have to observe as he runs his race and we weren't run ours
So the notion that Jesus is somehow exemplary of the fidelity that is required for a covenant relationship with God
is
An essential element of the message of Hebrews and it's how Hebrews answers the question of how the death of Christ is effective
It's effective because it instantiates that promise of divine forgiveness and amnesia
That language of forgetting sin not remembering sin anymore, which is in Jeremiah was repeated in chapter 10 of Hebrews
That yeah, that's all realized and what we get through the death of Christ
God's forgiveness of our sin and an example of how we are to relate to God
In as faithful people
Live that and all will be well says Hebrews. Thank you. Thank you
Last little subject then we'll get into some of the pericopee because I have really cool illustrations
My good friend Steven Nelson actually made so the last
Subject if you will of looking at it from an airplane views Melchizedek
We could probably do a whole episode on that cousin deck
But can you try to condense the topic of Melchizedek in Hebrews?
Jesus rule as high priest seems to be very important as well. Sure. Okay, so
That Melchizedek is a figure that appears twice in the Old Testament, right in Genesis 14 and in Psalm 110
4
Just an aside Psalm 110 is a text that was often cited by early Christians
But it's verse one of that Psalm that was cited
Which is referring to the exaltation of Christ, that's how it was understood
Psalm 110 4 is only cited in Hebrews. Why?
Because having established the fact or accepting the fact that Psalm 110 is somehow a reference to Christ
Then everything in the psalm must be somehow relevant to Christ and therefore
Psalm 110 4 might must be relevant to Christ. Now you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. What in the world does that mean?
one might ask and
Part of the answer is given by the the data that we have from the Genesis account of the encounter of Abraham and
Belchizedek
the only other place where
the figure appears and
We learned from
From Genesis and that's referred to in in Hebrews
7 that Melchizedek was a priest and the king
but
What Hebrews then does with that is
to say well
There's something odd about this this reference to Melchizedek because there's no reference to his birth
No reference to his parentage. No reference to his death
And we have to take scripture seriously one of the midst things as well as when it says things
This is a principle that you get in some rabbinic interpretations, too
So Hebrews is not making this up
And so the the absence of father mother genealogy is noted by Hebrews is ah
What we get in in Melchizedek is some sort of reference to a
spiritual eternal
Priest and king and sure enough. That's what Christ was according to Hebrews because Christ was the instrument of God's creation
Hebrews one right
So there's a very high
Christology that's in there in Hebrews Hebrews is not interested in
Explaining it in all of its details. He assumes it. Okay, and
Assumes that people will get the fact that this interpretation of the figure of Melchizedek will be
Based on on some principles, but it also was based on what they accepted
Understandings of they the divinity of Christ or the special status of Christ. So if you wanted to describe it in the first century
Now hot that's all well and good. But why go to all of that trouble?
because
Hebrews is interested in
typology between
the Yom Kippur sacrifice and
the death of Christ
Hebrews piles on a lot of symbols that help to interpret the the significance of the death of Christ
We've talked about the DFAK business and that's an important part of it, but it's not the only part of it a
Major structural element in the way that Hebrews
hangs together is this this parallel between the day of atonement sacrifice and the death of Christ and
One of the key points of that
Parallel is the unique character of each
The Yom Kippur sacrifices unique yearly
The sacrifice of Christ is absolutely unique. It's a one-time event and Hebrews makes a point of that
So the biblical pointer is a pointer and not an exact parallel
It's a type and not the reality itself
to use language that
Hebrews hints at and that gets picked up in a patristic interpretation. Okay, so
Hebrews is interested in establishing the relationship between the death of Christ and the Yom Kippur sacrifice and
the Yom Kippur sacrifice is
Special because it's offered by the high priest and only the high priest
who
Slaves the sacrificial animal and then sprinkles its its blood on the
The inner portion of the holy of holies on the mercy seat
the Kippur in Hebrew the elastere on in Greek
and thereby
achieves
remission of sin
Elimination of impurity however we want to understand what that action is about and that's another interesting topic
but the point is that Jesus somehow is is like
And fulfills the image of a high priest
But if you want to make that argument you have a problem
Right and the problem is that
according to Christian tradition Jesus is a descendant of the house of David and
Thereby a Judahite and not a Levite and so we can't be a priest
and Hebrews recognizes that and says
Says that in chapter 7 and but he gets around that by saying he's a priest according to the order of Melchizedek
So there's another kind of priest that the biblical text has long since
predicted and long since
Given us ways of understanding and we just have to recognize that that's the case and that
Jesus is a priest according to that principle and not according to the Levitical principle or the
Aronite principle however you want to describe the
the priestly tradition of Torah so
The Melchizedek chapter in in Hebrews solves a bit of a problem it enables the
the author to move ahead with his
typology of the Yom Kippur
sacrifice in the death of Christ
And it hints at the high Christology that's assumed as a foundation for a lot of the argument
Thank you. Thank you so much. Wonderful. Wonderful stuff. Okay. Okay. Let's get into some of this some of the recipe
got a
Example I'd like to get into Hebrews 1 1 and we'll try to blast through some of these so in Hebrews 1 1
I thought it was quite interesting to go ahead and put some different examples
We'll just read from the NASB
God after he spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways
One of the things I noticed in particular when I was looking at the translations
Is so right out the gate the Bible translators show a lot of variation verse 1 the Greek doesn't seem to have the word hour
But to the father so why do so many translation translators insert that word?
Is there anything significant about this in terms of who the author wants to convey?
The reason I ask also is one common sense question someone might ask is our
ancestors our fathers
Wouldn't that identify a lot of people will try to say this can't be Gentiles, right? They'll say these had to be Israel I
Along the way if you don't mind elaborating as we're like dealing with this issue here of whether it's to our fathers or to the fathers or even
if that matters
Can you tell us how?
Gentiles would be
It would be common or okay that you would refer to the fathers as Gentiles and included in that group
Do you see where I'm trying to like yeah
I think the simple answer to that question and the reason that some people would put in our I suppose there were different ways
That people would justify that and I'm not sure I'd want to do so
Well, but I think they have in mind the arguments that Paul makes in Galatians and Romans that
Gentile believers are adopted children of
of
Israel and so they can refer to our father Abraham because they were adopted children
so
What and this gets back to our initial conversation about who the audience is and I'm not sure we can tell on the basis of a
Particular word like this because we can see how words can be adapted to and explained within a situation that has developed within
the first century where Jews and Gentiles have come together in some communities at least
And understand themselves to be part of one people
So just referring to the patriarchs or the ancestors
Makes sense
As long as you assume that you're a member of this this community and he's also
Contrasting if I'm not mistaken. He's he's saying this was their message, right?
This was theirs what we have is different if I'm not mistaken like out the gate
He's trying to separate the two in a way contrast
well, there's contrast and
There's one other thing going on here, too
I think we have to recognize and that's the alliteration all the PPPs, okay, and some of the translations
Try to get get at that the alliteration of the assonance if you go back to they
First one. Yeah, Paula Marose. Hi, Paula. Trapos. Palai hatha us la lasas toys patras and in toys profetize
Right that they're at one two three four five words that begin with P in that whole business
Okay, and the first two words that have the assonance of Paula Marose. Hi, Paula Trapos
There's there's no way you can capture this in in English
without
you know
doing somersaults, but this is precisely the kind of
Sophisticated quasi poetic if you will well highly rhetorical language that people point to as distinctive of the style of Hebrews
so
the author of Hebrews would probably want to use
Patras and as much for the P is for anything else
But yeah, there's there's a distinction
Between old and new in Hebrews to get to the question you were asking
There's definitely a distinction
you frame it in terms of separation and
This gets at a much larger question about how early Christians thought of themselves in relationship to
their Israelite heritage
And
The so-called parting of the ways between Jews and Christians which has been the subject of debate over the course of the last 30 years 40 years
When did it happen? Was it something that took place at the Council of Yafne?
When people got thrown out of the synagogue if that happened there
So there's a lot of debate about that and I think the consensus these days is it is not a single simple event
that you have
Gentiles and Jews interacting
Within the Christian orbit
And around it for quite a while in the first couple of centuries and in different places
There's a lot more harmony and a lot a lot more interaction and a lot more engagement than there is in other places
Eventually of course things do get separated and Jews are relegated to a inferior position within the
The Roman late Roman political order, but that's not until the fourth century
so
We ought not
Assume when contrast is is involved that separation is involved
Okay, and one of the things that is going on in Hebrews in terms of its literary style is
Something that the ancient orders called synchrosis or comparison
And there's a lot of synchrosis or comparison going on in Hebrews and the way that they syncretic arguments generally work is that
you're
you're praising someone or something a Roman senator or a
Literary author and you praise him by comparing him or her or it whatever you're
praising or talking about with other examples of the same type, but yours is better
Okay
and I think that's in
Part what's going on here Hebrews is doing a standard rhetorical thing saying yeah, we have a tradition
that we're plugged into that we know and
Respect in some way or other and what we have is a culmination of that tradition
That's better than anything we can find in it
So I think that's what Hebrews is trying to argue and is that a kind of early anti-semitism or is it?
just a kind of
Tutting one's own horn that does eventually lead in the very unfortunate direction, right? Yeah, there was a conference some years ago at
I think it was University of St. Andrews and there were some distinguished
Scholars there and I remember two of them taking
diametrically opposite points on that particular subject
One emphasizing the continuity and another emphasizing the discontinuity and the distinction between
Judaism and Christianity as being celebrated by Hebrews and the truth lies somewhere
I think in between Hebrews is saying yeah, what we got is really good, but it's based upon something. It was good
What's we're just better?
Yeah, the same problem happens with Paul
Paul Paul scholars always have that problem. So moving on to Hebrews 2 16 through 17 a
For surely it is not angels that he helps but he helps the offspring of Abraham
Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every aspect so that he might become a
become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God to make propitiation for the sins of the people you
Suggested the verb help here in Hebrews 2 16 implies take hold of
Meaning that Christ takes hold of the offspring of Abraham on the way to glory and you can tend that the reference to
Offspring of Abraham has nothing to do with fleshly externals and that it's a common Christian self designation
So we're probably going to be touching on the same idea over and over on this white if who are the offspring of Abraham
Do you think the author has the same thing in mind that Paul describes in Romans 9 where the children of the promise are actually
Gentiles who are merely counted as the offspring of Abraham through faith
It seems like Paul fills the need to qualify his references to Gentiles as the offspring of Abraham through faith
But the author of Hebrews simply refers to the offspring of Abraham without clarifying that this refers to Christians in general
And this might be that whole thing you were saying about the debate is over like we already know who the offspring of Abraham are the true
Heirs of Christ are the offspring of Abraham in this evidence that perhaps he's addressing a predominantly Jewish Christian audience
Which you kind of answer this these are my notes
But this also gets the question if you don't mind in the vein of this and I hope you keep track of where I'm going
We can always I can always repeat anything. I apologize for bringing a lot up
But the idea where you talked about the Gentiles are being adopted and I see this clear language in Galatians that says that
But Paul says in Romans 9 6 that that it is to the Israel according to the flesh
He's talked about his brothers his Jewish brothers that he wished he could be cut off for the sake of them
And he says it is to them the adoption is now if they're children of Abraham like literally by flesh
What does it mean that they're the adoption and yet then Gentiles are saying they're being adopted
Do you get what I'm trying to say like why would you need to adopt literal?
descendants of Abraham
But Gentiles who aren't in that sense actual descendants of Abraham in any literal seed sense if that makes sense
Yeah, that's really a question about the exegesis of of of Romans and how Paul's argument is working there
Maybe we'll get to that after we do. I don't know
And I
The way I understand what's going on here
I think it reflects that the earlier conversation we had about
About what what the issues were that were on the table at different points
And I I think that Hebrews probably is a little more likely to be later rather than earlier
And I think the the issues about Jews and Gentiles that Paul was wrestling with have been more or less
Solved by the time that Hebrews comes along and so he can use a term like this without explaining it without arguing about it
without worrying about its implications because it's come to be used as a
designation of the people he's addressing they understand themselves to be the
Sperma Abraham
the offspring of Abraham whether that is is by
Natural generation or by adoption
They understand themselves to be part of that heritage
So I think that's what's going on here
And it's it's not an issue that Hebrews has to worry about
Paul in in Romans 9 through 11 is
Making some interesting arguments and doing some some twists and turns as he wrestles with the fact that
his his people Jewish people have not accepted his arguments about
The relationship of God to Gentiles and he has to explain it and explains that
Okay, they're they are being shut out for a while
By their their choice by their rejection of his message
But eventually all Israel will be saved and eventually because they are jealous of we will become jealous of what has happened to Gentiles
They too will get it
So it's a curious kind of argument that he develops and you could see how he's trying to wrestle with this
Disappointment that he said he's had that his message has not been accepted by his own his own native people
His own relatives
So he has to make some twists and turns and would have to look at those twists and turns in order to make sense of things like adoption language
But that's the general framework that Gentiles have been adopted into God's people and our children of Abraham
And that's been settled by the time you get to Hebrews. Thank you so much
I'd love to go further down the road if possible with some of these things there
It's an interesting conversation. I think in the early communities of Christianity
Hebrews 9 15
Here we have for this reason
He is the mediator of a new covenant so that since the since a death has been taken place for the redemption of the violations
That were committed under the first covenant
Those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance and of course
This goes back to the violation and act of disobedience in Hebrews 2 2 3 Hebrews 9 15 refers to transgressions or violations
That took place under the first covenant
Hebrews 2 2 3 also refers to transgression and of disobedience in the reference to these
Transgressions under the first covenant similar to the concept of transgression of the law that Paul refers to in Romans 2 23
Referring to Jews does the author of Hebrews differentiated between
Jewish violations of Torah and the kind of sin that all mankind included Gentiles need
redemption from I
Guess it's kind of a it's a very complex issue, but yeah, I I think that
What what he's referring to here is is
Transgressions that have been identified under the first covenant and that covers a pretty broad range doesn't it?
including
you know murder and adultery
and
Failure to perform sacrifice appropriately and failure to observe
Observe purity laws etc. I mean there's a broad range of things that one could
Understand as a parabbas is is a transgression that are defined in the first covenant, so I don't think he's he's simply referring to
Events that have taken place. I think he's referring to the things that are
Inscribed in the in the Torah
And that's the whole whole kitten caboodle to kind of get into a specific on that and getting your ideas
I'm loving this conversation by the way
Where Gentiles did they commit sins under the first covenant would would they be in the category of committing sins under that first
Covenant according to by the time you get in the first century and the New Testament
There are different answers to that that kind of question, but the standard rabbinic answer which may be lurking in the background here is that
The first covenant that God made was not a Monsignor, but it was with Noah
and
there are no acic commands that were given to all human beings and that
all human beings are obliged to keep them I not kill etc and that
People have transgressed those commandments and they know it because you know that they understand morality to some some extent
Even if they've never heard of Moses and his Torah
So it's possible that some notion like that is lurking behind this expression that they
the
transgressions identified in the in the first covenant
We're already expressed by God and his covenant with Noah and that yeah, Gentiles are guilty of transgressing
those
commandments too
And also just just to throw an idea out there about the mosaic covenant if I'm not mistaken
Doesn't Paul in Romans 2 or 1 through really 1 through 3
Explain this about these people who weren't given the law. They didn't have the law, but we're guilty
They were guilty of performing idolatry number one and of course it gets into sexual deviants
Deviancies and things like that according to Paul's ideas
Whatever that might have been in the first century, but the point is is they're guilty yet. They weren't given the law
Mm-hmm. Let's say we're giving the mosaic Paul Paul has a notion of natural morality
We're of it's coming from stoic philosophy perhaps
And he invokes that in in in that opening chapter of Romans to talk about the universality of human sin and guilt
Yeah, do you think Hebrews has some of this going on probably he's very sophisticated
So what are your thoughts? Yeah, well Hebrews is not interested in that question. Let's put it that way
I mean one can
One can call upon those texts to show how people were wrestling with the the question of morality outside of they the chosen people and outside of the
mosaic revelation and
There they were clearly people like Paul and the rabbis who said yeah, there's a moral law around there and people are
Are obliged to obey it even if they have never
It been exposed to the Torah
Yeah, that that argument is there on whatever foundation it might be laid and I think in the Pauline case
It's probably based on philosophical presuppositions as well as any kind of
Exegetical move. Thank you so much. I really do appreciate you taking the time to answer that
We have Hebrews 8 8 and Jeremiah 31. This is that herking back to the original
I will make a new covenant passage in the Hebrew Bible and
I guess I'll read for finding and fault with the people
He says behold days are coming says the Lord when I will bring about with the house of Israel and the house of Judah a new
Covenant Jeremiah 31 31 same thing. I will make with the house instead of saying bring about I will make but
One of the things that it also does is in Hebrews 8 10 if I can pull that up before I give you my
Particular context here for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days declares the Lord
I will put my laws into their minds and on their hearts. I will inscribe them for I will be merciful toward their iniquities
And their sins. I will remember that no more I in speaking of the new covenant
He makes the first one obsolete and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away
Hebrews chapter 8 quotes
Jeremiah 32 31 to 34
Concluding that the first covenant is obsolete then the author re quotes part of the same passage in chapter 10
Concluding that there's no longer a need for sacrifices for sin
You suggested that Jeremiah's new covenant was more like a renewal of the old covenant in in its original context
Whereas the author of Hebrews seems to be taking Jeremiah out of context
Can you elaborate on that because this becomes a difficult issue? There are some people who want to take
Literal what Hebrews 8 8 saying I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah
and if we know the history
there's two separate houses of Israel that are separated in history and
Some people even go so far as to bring it down into the New Testament and think that the Gentiles are
Really lost apostatized
Northern house of Israel people now
I know this is totally fringe and something that would not even appear on your radar
But I'm just making the point. How do we know that Hebrews 8 8 is not
Meaning literally what Jeremiah is saying about this with the house of Israel and the house of Judah if that makes sense
Hey, interesting. Well, I think we have to see what Hebrews is doing with its scriptural texts generally, right?
And is it reading things in a simple literal way? No, it's reading things in terms of typological
relationships between old and new
or
some sort of it doesn't quite move into the level of allegory the way and origin or
other church fathers do
But it definitely makes a distinction between
The old and what it points to and he makes that explicit at the beginning of chapter 10, by the way, right?
where the old is a shadow of
The body that is to come and chapter 10 has an interesting way of working that little image
so I think to be hung up on the
Literal character of what Hebrews is talking about is a bit of a problem given what Hebrews generally does with Scripture
one other example is
the
the business about entering the rest
In chapters three and four right now Sam 95
What is the rest? Is it a is it the resting place of Canaan?
Yeah, but it's the resting place where God himself entered on the seventh day. That's what Hebrews says
Why did he say that?
Because of this Geshe-Rashawa argument that the word for rest
Katapa Katepos and the verb in the psalm text
Echoes the word in the Greek of the of the book of Genesis where God enters his Katapa
Yes, okay, so you make a connection between Genesis and Psalm 95 and that tells you what the rest is
The rest is not the land of Canaan. It's not something physical. Ah, it's that place where God himself entered and that's where we're going
That shows I think that look Hebrews is doing something more than a literal reading
Biblical text and that happens a lot throughout the New Testament. Yeah. Yeah
so to
To force a literal reading of the prophetic text
On to Hebrews is to do violence. I think what's going on in Hebrews
But and look what's going on between chapters eight and ten and I
Mentioned this earlier on I think
The fact that the the scriptural text is is cited and recited
At the beginning and the end of the exposition of the Yom Kippur typology
Okay, so the Yom Kippur typology about the death of Christ being a new day of atonement sacrifice
Is embedded in a larger reflection on how the new covenant is created and
What cited at the end in chapter 10 is a selection
From the citation at the beginning and the selection focuses on precisely the kinds of things that
Hebrews is most interested in and that Hebrews has been involved in
Expounding in the intervening intervening chapters and what are they there?
They the writing on the heart of this new covenant and we talked about how that happens, right?
And the forgiveness of sins and the forgiveness of sins comes by God promising not to remember sin anymore
Okay, all of this hinges upon
the covenant
Testament that's made possible by the death of Christ. That's what Hebrews is arguing
Okay, so I'm arguing about Judah and Israel
It's arguing about the death of Christ and what the significance of that death is for the people who are having this homily read to them
So and I think I guess the Jewish community would identify themselves with all of that as
Shadows to the real reality which is in Christ Paul says in relations
By Jewish community, I think we have to recognize. It's a Jewish Christian community
I don't think Hebrews is writing to people who don't accept Christ in some way as as
The savior right right, okay final pericopee here and that is Hebrews 9
926 let me read it here
But as it is he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
Hebrews 9 26 says that Christ's appearance happened at the
Consummation of the ages did the author believe that the end times begun during Christ's appearance on earth
Hmm
This raises a yeah, probably so I think the simple answer to the question is yes
This raises the interesting question of the relationship of Hebrews to the Jewish apocalyptic and early Christian apocalyptic tradition and
there's been a
Long-standing debate in in Hebrews scholarship about whether Hebrews tends more toward a
Philosophical reading of the Christ event or more toward an apocalyptic or eschatological reading of the the Christ event
And some some people there was a famous
Scholar in the middle of the 20th century French scholar says love speak
Who wrote before the Krumran texts were discovered and argued that Hebrews is really very close to Philo the Jewish philosopher
Of Alexandria roughly contemporary with Christ, maybe 30 BC to 40 AD somewhere in there
And that's what you have going on in Hebrews is a kind of platonic reflection on things
And other people after especially after the Dead Sea Scrolls came on to the scene saying no Hebrews is really
into the apocalyptic scenario
That's reflected in the New Testament and the
Eschatological predictions of Jesus at etc. They're in Paul too, especially first Thessalonians
My first Corinthians as well
First Corinthians is a relevant text. We'll come back to that in a minute, but in any case
I think what you have are bits and pieces of both kinds of traditions
And I think what you you have in the audience that Hebrews is addressing
There are people who have an ear for the kind of language that he uses, but they probably also have
The mentality that
appreciates the subtle appropriation of different intellectual and symbolic traditions
And I think what you have in Hebrews is a play on those different symbolic and intellectual traditions
Hebrews accepts in some significant way
that
History is is not a random thing history is developing and according to some divine plan
And at the end of of history God is going to bring things into some sort of
Divine order and that that begins with the the Christ event
He's not alone in having that that kind of understanding of the flow of human time
And it's coming out of Jewish apocalyptic tradition. Hello, it might be made
Acceptable to a philosopher who buys into a stoic tradition too in any case
And there are gestures toward what sounds like Platonic language, but there's not a consistent Platonism in Hebrews
You have someone who's a very clever
Literary artist who can play on these different intellectual and conceptual traditions and do so in a way to make his case
And I think that's what's definitely going on here and the
Consummation of the ages sounds an awful lot like what Paul is saying in 1st Corinthians 7 that
You know the shape of this world is passing away
It's gonna take a while before it passes away, but that passing has begun
So interesting Paul would say so
Yeah, there's so many things about Hebrews that I find interesting and trying to find out who the author might have been
There's a lot of debate over this people are trying to say it may have been this guy
I may have been this person either way. They were sophisticated
highly educated in Greek they knew how to write well and
I hope this was a wonderful takeaway for anybody watching. How can we?
Support get the books. Is there is there anything in particular you have coming out that you're working on now that you're in retirement?
Not on Hebrews
I'm working on the fourth gospel these days more than anything else, but I have a number of other things that
Articles mainly articles that have been coming out
But they the main project is another commentary just what the world needs a commentary on the gospel of John
But it doesn't have mine yet
So that's the main thing I'm working on. I
Yeah, I apologize go ahead. No, I was just gonna say the the Hermione commentary series is alive and well and
It's a great resource for people who are interested in these texts
If I can ask one thing like a major thing if you could think of one
What have you changed your mind on that you had in the commentary that you would say is a big like a big thing?
Is there anything I think the one thing that I've given further thought to is the relationship between
Hebrews understanding of faith and Paul's understanding of faith
And I think
Back when I wrote the commentary back in the the 80s
I
Think I was resistant to the
If you will the subjective genitive understanding of the faith of Christ that was becoming popular at the time
And I think it's still a matter of debate, but it's clear that Hebrews understands the faith that Jesus himself had and expressed
In his relationship to God as foundational for our relationship to God
And we're supposed to follow that and understand ourselves in the light of it
Light of the the action and the fidelity of Christ
So I think I drew a contrast between what Hebrews is doing and what Paul did
But now I think that they're probably closer than I I gave them credit for at that point
Interesting. Yeah, there were some other little things to the on which I definitely changed my mind. They the business about
Sarah conceiving and as an example of faith
and
I
Think Sarah is being referred to rather than
Just being sidelined in that that list
Wow
Interesting stuff to go into I really look forward to hearing about John
Maybe maybe we can talk further about that as time goes by and I had a lot of stuff on acts that I put on the side
I thought well you help edit the pervo commentary and what a wonderful commentary
I thought that was and it would be wonderful to get your thoughts on maybe some time in the future
But since you're working on John that might be the next target show if you're interested and anyone who's watching
Let us know in the chat comment down below. Give us a thumbs up. I would love to have dr. Atridge back
Thank you so much for your time. Is there anything you'd like to say to everybody before we go? No, I'm happy new year
You as well, thank you, and don't forget we are
myth vision
