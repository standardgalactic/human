Perhaps the most famous story from ancient Iraq is the epic of Gilgamesh, a story about
a quest for meaning and immortality.
The adventurous ruler seeks to secure his own immortality, only to be foiled time and
again along the way.
The epic of Gilgamesh, composed in the 2nd millennium BCE, nearly 4,000 years ago, was
a magisterial piece of literature that was used, amongst other things, to train scribes
to read and write.
The story gained such popularity that it influenced the most famous book known to humanity, the
Bible.
In the end, our hero learns that his secret to immortality is not to be found with some
magical plant or decision of the gods, but with the memory that he leaves behind through
his great accomplishments.
Most people may have heard the name of Gilgamesh, but have never taken the time to actually
read the epic.
Don't worry, we will help you get the gist of the epic of Gilgamesh, and hope to help
you understand, in some ways, how the ideas expressed in its epic have impacted the Bible.
Our story begins with the narrator praising some of these wondrous deeds and attributes
of the ancient king of the city of Uruk, he who saw the wellspring, the foundations of
the land, who knew the world's ways, was wise in all things, he it was, who studied
seats of power everywhere, full knowledge of it all he gained.
This knowledge that he gained was no ordinary type of information, Gilgamesh learned the
secrets from before the time of the worldwide flood.
The reader is encouraged to look upon the mighty city of Uruk that Gilgamesh had constructed.
He built the walls of Ramparted Uruk, the lustrous treasury of Halod Iyana, see its
upper wall which girds it like a core, gaze at the lower course which no one can equal,
the wooden staircase, there from days of old, approach Iyana, the dwelling of Ishtar, which
no future king, no human being, can equal.
God up, pace out the walls of Uruk, study the foundation terrace and examine the brickwork,
one square mile of city, one square mile of gardens, one square mile of clay pits, a half
square mile of Ishtar's dwelling, three and a half square miles is the measure of Uruk.
One of the traditions in ancient Mesopotamia was for a king to record mighty deeds and
to place them in a box and bury the box in a foundation of a major structure or a city
wall.
This is known as a foundation deposit when a future king would rebuild a structure because
it was worn down and needed to be rebuilt.
They would often look for a foundation deposit.
In this way, kings could leave messages for the gods and for future rulers in these foundation
boxes.
The Epic of Gogamesh is said to have been just such a deposit.
Open the foundation box of cedar, release its lock of bronze, raise the lid upon its
hidden contents, take up and read from the lapis tablet of all the miseries that he,
Gogamesh, came through.
What Gogamesh experienced was of extraordinary difficulty and the lessons he learned from
these hardships were captured in this story.
Gogamesh was no ordinary king.
Heart human, part divine, he was the perfect image of a hero.
Surpassing all kings for his stature renowned, heroic offspring of Uruk, a charging wild
bull.
Towering Gogamesh is uncannily perfect.
We learn from the beginning that this mighty warrior worked tirelessly to search for a
way to obtain immortality.
Opening passes in the mountains, digging wells at the highlands verge, traversing the ocean,
the vast sea to the sun's rising, exploring the furthest reaches of the earth, seeking
everywhere for eternal life.
He was quite the specimen.
The locks of his hair grew thick as a grain field.
His teeth gleamed like the rising sun.
His hair was dark as deep blue strands of wool, eleven cupids.
About sixteen feet six inches was his height, his chest four cupids.
About six feet, a triple cupid, his feet four and a half feet, his leg six times twelve.
His stride was six times twelve cupids.
His great size and power made him a great hero, but also made it possible for him to
abuse his people.
Gilgamesh could wrestle with fifty companions, wearing out young men every day.
He kept the young men of Uruk fearful of mistreatment.
In ramparted Uruk, he strode back and forth, lording it like a wild bull.
His head thrust high.
The onslaught of his weapons had no equal.
His companions stood forth by his game stick.
He was herring the young men of Uruk beyond reason.
Gilgamesh would leave no son to his father.
Day and night, he would rampage fiercely.
Not only did the men of Uruk suffer, but this great king, who was supposed to care for his
people, even abused the women.
Gilgamesh, king of this numberless people, he, the shepherd of ramparted Uruk, Gilgamesh
would leave no girl to her mother.
Gilgamesh would leave no young woman to her husband.
Gilgamesh would take advantage of the girls of Uruk before they would marry a husband,
so the people cried out to the gods, complaining about their king's behavior.
Their bitter clamor rose up to the sky.
The warrior's daughter, the young man's chosen, Ishtar kept hearing their complaints.
Their bitter complaint reached the heaven of Anu.
Anu devises a plan.
What if a rival were to be created for the unruly king?
Let them summon Aruru, the great one.
She created the human race.
Let her create a match for Gilgamesh, mighty in strength.
Let them contend with each other that Uruk may have peace.
At Anu's command, Aruru began her work.
Aruru wet her hands.
She pinched off clay.
She cast it down upon the step.
She created valiant Inkidu in the step.
Who was this Inkidu?
What was he like when he was created?
We are not left to guess.
Shaggy with hair was his whole body.
He was made lush with head hair, like a woman.
The locks of his hair grew thick as a grain filled.
He knew neither people nor inhabited land.
He dressed as animals do.
He ate grass with gazelles.
With beasts, he jostled at the water hold.
With wildlife, he drank his fill of water.
Inkidu is here described in ways that are similar to descriptions
of uncivilized people groups.
Those that live in the city are civilized
and are loved by the gods.
Here, Inkidu is portrayed as one who knows nothing
of civilization and must be taught the ways of city life.
Inkidu quickly began to make problems
for the people in the city.
A hunter, a trapping man, encountered him at the water hold.
One day, a second, and a third.
He encountered him at the water hold.
When he saw him, the hunter stood stock still with terror.
As for Inkidu, he went home with his beasts.
The hunter was aghast, struck dumb.
His fillings were in turmoil, his face drawn.
There was sorrow in his heart.
His face was like a travelers from afar.
The hunter made ready to speak, saying to his father,
my father, there was a certain fellow
who comes to the water hold.
He is the mightiest in the land.
Strength is his, like the force of heaven.
So mighty is his strength.
He constantly ranges over the uplands,
constantly eating grass with beast,
constantly making his way to the water hold.
I am too frightened to approach him.
He is filled in the pits I dug.
He has torn out my traps I set.
He has helped the beast, wildlife of the step.
Slipped from my hands, he will not let me work the step.
What a situation to be in.
This hunter, who makes his livelihood
from the animals in the step,
has encountered an animal-like man,
incredibly strong, who has been aiding the animals
in escaping the hunter.
The hunter's father advises him
to go to the king, Gogamesh.
He will give you Shamhat, the harlot.
Take her with you.
Let her prevail over him instead of a mighty man.
When the wild beast draw near the water hole,
let her strip off her clothing,
laying bare her charms.
When he sees her, he will approach her.
His beast that grew up with him on the step will deny him.
An interesting plan to say the least,
the prostitute Shamhat is to entice Inkidu
and have sex with him,
after which he will become foreign to the animals,
who will no longer have anything to do with him.
Sounds like Adam and Eve with the animals.
As we might expect,
when the hunter approaches Gogamesh with the problem,
he sends him to the step with Shamhat.
The two of them stake out the watering hole.
When the time comes, Inkidu and the animals come to drink.
There he is, Shamhat, open your embrace.
Open your loins, let him take your charms.
Be not bashful, take his vitality.
When he sees you, he will approach you.
Toss aside your clothing, let him lie upon you.
Treat him a human to woman's work.
His beast will deny him, though he grew up with them.
As in his passion, he caresses you.
Shamhat complies and Inkidu approaches her.
Six days, seven nights was Inkidu aroused,
flowing into Shamhat.
After he had his fill of her delights,
he set off towards the beast.
When they saw him, Inkidu, the gazelles, shied off.
The wild beast of the step shunned his person.
Inkidu has polluted his virginal body.
Not only could the animals sense the difference,
Inkidu himself had undergone physical changes.
His knees stood still while his beasts were going away.
Inkidu was too slow, he could not run as before,
but he gained reason, broadening his understanding.
Indeed, he had moved one step closer
toward life in the city and civilization.
With nowhere else to go,
Inkidu comes back to Shamhat, who tells him,
you are handsome, Inkidu, you are become like a god.
Why roam the step with wild beast?
Come, let me lead you to rampart at Uruk,
to the hallowed temple, a boat of Anu and Ishtar,
the place of Gilgamesh, who is perfect in strength,
and so like a wild bull, he lords it over the young men.
Excited about the prospect of finding a friend,
Inkidu replies, come Shamhat,
escort me to the lustrous hallowed temple,
a boat of Anu and Ishtar, the place of Gilgamesh,
who is perfect in strength, and so like a wild bull,
he lords it over the young men.
I myself will challenge him.
I will speak out boldly.
I will raise a cry in Uruk.
I am the mighty one.
I am the one who will change destinies.
He who was born in the step is mighty, strength is his.
Shamhat attempts to nuance Inkidu's intent
in going to Uruk to meet Gilgamesh.
The gods favor Gilgamesh, attested by his strength and beauty.
Inkidu should come to Uruk to enjoy the life
that courses through the city.
Where young men are resplendent in holiday clothing,
where every day is set for a celebration,
where drums never stop beating, and the harlots too.
They are fairest of form, rich in beauty, full of delights.
Even the great gods are kept from sleeping at night.
The story shifts back to Uruk,
where Gilgamesh has had a dream,
and he is bringing it to his mother,
the goddess Ninsun, to have her explain its meaning.
Mother, such a dream I had last night.
There were stars of heaven around me,
as the force of heaven kept falling toward me.
I tried to carry it, but it was too strong for me.
I tried to move it, but I could not budge it.
This thing that fell from heaven
became the focus of all the people of Uruk.
Everyone clamored to see it, and Gilgamesh explains,
I fell in love with it like a woman.
I caressed it, carried it off, and laid it down before you.
Then you were making it my partner.
Ninsun explains that the dream means
there will come to you a strong one,
a companion who rescues a friend.
He will be mighty in the land.
Strengths will be his like the force of heaven.
So mighty will be his strength.
You will fall in love with him like a woman.
You will caress him.
He will be mighty and rescue you,
time and again, thinking of King David and Jonathan.
Following this explanation,
he tells his mother of a second similar dream,
which is interpreted in much the same way.
The king was overjoyed at the prospect
of gaining a close friend.
The scene shifts back to Shamhad and Inkidu.
She clothes Inkidu and took him to the shepherd's hut
where a sheepfold was.
The shepherds crowded around him.
They said to themselves of their own accord,
this fellow is like Gilgamesh and stature.
Inkidu was served bread and beer,
things that he had never consumed before.
Inkidu did not eat the bread.
He eyed it uncertainly, then stared.
Inkidu did not know to eat bread,
nor had he ever learned to drink beer.
Shamhad encourages him and Inkidu eats,
becoming further civilized.
Inkidu ate the bread until he was sated.
He drank seven juglets of beer.
His mood became relaxed.
He was singing joyously.
He felt lighthearted and his features glowed.
He had his hair cut from his body
and was anointed with oil.
Then put on proper clothing and became more human.
With his great strength,
he protected the shepherds and their flock,
guarding them through the night and killing lions.
One day, a traveler comes by and tells Shamhad and Inkidu
that he is going to the city of Uruk to celebrate a wedding.
However, much to Inkidu's surprise and dismay,
there's a darker side to the ceremony.
For Gilgamesh, king of broad-marted Uruk,
people's veils are open for his choosing.
He mates with the lawful wife.
He first, the groom after.
By divine decree pronounced,
from the cutting of his umbilical cord, she is his do.
For this, Inkidu will not stand.
He and Shamhad make their way to Uruk.
When he entered the street of broad-marted Uruk,
a multitude crowded around him.
They said about him,
he is equal to Gilgamesh and build,
though shorter in stature, he is stronger of frame.
With the entire city gathered around,
Inkidu confronts Gilgamesh.
As Gilgamesh went to sleep with the bride,
Inkidu blocked the door to the wedding with his foot,
not allowing Gilgamesh to enter an earth-shaking fight.
They grappled with each other, crouching like bulls.
They shattered the doorpost, the wall shook,
they fought in the street, the public square.
It was Gilgamesh who knelt for the win.
His foot on the ground, his fury abated, he turned away.
Gilgamesh had won, but it appears not by much.
Inkidu then addresses Gilgamesh.
As one unique did your mother bear you,
the wild cow of the ramparts, Ninsun,
exalted you above the most valorous of men.
Inlil has granted you kingship over the people.
From that point forward, the two were inseparable.
They kissed each other and made friends.
Inkidu and Gilgamesh go to Ninsun, Gilgamesh's mother,
and she warns him that this friendship
will ultimately result in difficulty.
After lamenting such news,
Gilgamesh formulates a plan that will gain them fame.
There dwells in the forest a fierce monster.
Humbaba, you and I shall kill him
and wipe out something evil from the land.
Let us surprise him in his dwelling.
Given his experience in the forest,
Inkidu warns Gilgamesh that Humbaba
is quite the formidable opponent.
Humbaba's cries the roar of a deluge.
His maw is fire, his breath is death.
The dwelling of Humbaba is a hopeless quest.
He explains that Inlil himself had set Humbaba
to guard the cedar forest.
Gilgamesh responds that this journey
is of utmost importance.
People's days are numbered.
Whatever the attempt is a puff of air.
Here you are, even you, afraid of death?
What good is your bravery's might?
I will go before you.
You can call out to me.
Go on, be not afraid.
If I fall, I'll have established my name.
Gilgamesh, who joined battle with fierce Humbaba,
they'll say, I must establish eternal fame.
Come, my friend, let's be off to the foundry.
Let them cast axes such as we'll need.
They armed themselves with a variety of deadly weapons
and went before the assembly of the city of Urk.
Gilgamesh addressed the elders of the city,
telling them of their plans.
Inkidu attempts to persuade the elders
to turn Gilgamesh from this plan.
He must not go to the forest of cedars.
That journey is not to be undertaken.
That being is not to be looked upon.
The elders agree with Inkidu
and attempt to persuade Gilgamesh
against this course of action.
Gilgamesh, however, remains determined to go.
I will slay Humbaba like a lion.
I will lash together logs of cedar,
cypress and every green trees.
I will gather the bows upon it.
I will cut off Humbaba's head
and I will navigate downstream.
Realizing that Gilgamesh is not to be deterred,
the elders entrust Gilgamesh to Inkidu's care.
Let Inkidu walk before you.
He knows the way to the forest of cedars.
He has seen battle, been exposed to combat.
Let Inkidu protect his friend, safeguard his companion.
Let him return to be a grave husband.
We in our assembly entrust the king to you.
On your return, entrust the king to us.
Before setting off, the two warriors visit Ninsun
in order to receive her blessing on the quest.
In a lengthy prayer, Ninsun asks Shamash, the sun god,
to watch over them.
Armed and under the protection of the gods,
the two make their way west to the cedar forest.
Given their great size, strength and stamina,
the pair is able to cover a tremendous distance
in just a short period of time.
20 double leagues, they took a bite to eat.
At 30 double leagues, they made their camp.
50 double leagues, they went in a single day.
A journey of a month and a half in three days.
As they set up camp, Gilgamesh asks to be given a dream
in order to be reassured
that he will be successful in his venture.
Inkidu builds Gilgamesh, a small shelter in which to sleep
and performs a ritual of spreading flour
in a circle on the ground.
As Gilgamesh sleeps, he dreams of a mountain
falling on top of him.
In the middle of the night, he awoke,
got up and said to his friend,
my friend, did you not call me?
Why am I awake?
Did you not touch me?
Why am I disturbed?
Did the god not pass by?
Why does my flesh tingle?
My friend, I had a dream
and the dream I had was very disturbing.
Inkidu reassures Gilgamesh
that the dream was a good omen.
My friend, the mountain you saw is Humbaba.
We will catch Humbaba.
We will kill him.
We will throw down his corpse on the field of battle.
Then at dawn, we will see good tidings from Shamash.
The cycle repeats.
They travel a great distance.
Gilgamesh dreams and Inkidu interprets.
Finally, the two reach their destination,
the cedar forest.
They stood there, marveling at the forest.
They gazed at the height of the cedars.
They gazed at the way into the forest.
But all was not well with our hero.
As the cedar cast its shadow,
Gilgamesh was beset by fear.
Stiffness seized his arms.
Then numbness befell his legs.
In spite of his friend's panic,
Inkidu exclaims, let's go into the forest, on with it.
Let's raise our challenge.
Perhaps to talk himself out of his own fear,
Gilgamesh gives a rousing speech to Inkidu.
Why, my friend, we are trembling like weaklings.
We, who crossed all the mountains,
signs will appear before us further along.
We will see some light.
My friend is a veteran of combat.
One who has experienced battle is not afraid of death.
You have spattered yourself with gore.
You're not afraid of death.
Get your blood up like an oracle.
Work yourself into a trance.
Your battle cry should boom like a drum.
Get the stiffness out of your arms.
Rive the numbness from your legs.
Take hold of me, my friend.
Your thoughts should focus on battle.
We now get our first glimpse into the mind
of the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba.
Humbaba debated with himself,
saying, no seeker of cedar has come.
No seeker of cypress has come.
Why are the birds perturbed?
Why are my very own birds alarmed?
Returning to our heroes,
Inkidu now speaks confidently to Gilgamesh.
My friend, one is one, but two are double.
Though one be weak, two together are strong.
If one cannot scale a slippery slope,
two can do it together.
A three-strand rope is stronger when doubled.
Two cubs are stronger than a mighty lion.
Preparing for attack, Gilgamesh prays
to his divine protector, the sun god Shamash.
Forget not that day, oh Shamash.
I put my trust in you.
Stand by me now.
Protect Gilgamesh, scion of Eruc.
Shamash replies, Marie, confront him.
Do not let him go off into the forest.
Do not let him enter the thicket.
He has not dawned all his seven fearsome cloaks.
One he has on, six he has left off.
The following section is fragmentary,
but when the text picks back up,
we see Humbaba speaking directly to our heroes.
Why have you made your way here?
Come, Inkidu, small fry.
Who does not know his father?
Spawn of a turtle or tortoise?
You suck no mother's milk.
I used to see you when you were younger,
but would not go near you.
Had I killed the likes of you, would I have filled my belly?
Why have you brought Gilgamesh to me with evil intent
and taken a stand there like some foreign foe?
I should slash the throat and neck of Gilgamesh.
I should let flying insects, screaming eagles and vultures
feed on his flesh.
Gilgamesh starts to waver in his resolve
and Inkidu pushes him to attack.
Gilgamesh advanced, eating his friend's advice.
He sprang like a lion.
While Inkidu rushed forward like a bodyguard,
then they seized Humbaba in the forest.
His cry filled the forest.
After a fierce struggle, Gilgamesh overpowers Humbaba.
The mighty guardian then pleads for his life to be spared.
Oh Gilgamesh, a dead man cannot serve a master.
A living slave is profitable for his master.
Oh Gilgamesh, spare my life.
You will be master wherever I am.
Inkidu warns Gilgamesh.
Friend, do not listen to what Humbaba says.
Do not heed his entreaties.
To whom Humbaba responds, I might have lifted you up,
dangled you from a twig at the entrance to my forest.
I might have let flying insects, screaming eagles
and vultures feed on your flesh.
Now then Inkidu, mercy is up to you.
Tell Gilgamesh to spare my life.
Just as Humbaba did not kill Inkidu,
Inkidu should spare Humbaba.
Unfortunately, his pleas fall on deaf ears.
Inkidu presses Gilgamesh, finish him off for the kill.
Put him out of his existence.
Establish your reputation for all time.
Gilgamesh who slew Humbaba.
Having run out of options,
the guardian of the forest appeals directly to Shumat,
but it appears that no help is forthcoming.
Humbaba turns and curses Inkidu for what he has done
and the lack of mercy shown to him.
Gilgamesh then finally turns and kills Humbaba.
Gilgamesh heeded his friend's words.
He drew up the sword at his side.
Gilgamesh smote him in the neck.
He struck him, Humbaba the guardian, down to the ground.
He slew the monster, guardian of the forest.
Having slain the guardian of the cedar forest,
the two set out to cut down large cedar trees.
These actions killing Humbaba and cutting down
the cedar trees would likely anger Enlil.
Inkidu relays this to Gilgamesh.
My friend, we have made a wasteland of the forest.
How shall we answer for it to Enlil and Nipur
when he says, you slew the guardian as a deed of valor.
But what was this, your fury,
that you decimated the forest?
In hopes of placating Enlil,
they plan to cut down the tallest cedar
and bring it back to Nipur
to build a huge door for Enlil's temple out of it.
Let no stranger approach it.
May the God love it.
Let the Euphrates bring it to Nipur.
Nipur, the sanctuary of Enlil,
may Enlil be delighted with you.
May Enlil rejoice over it.
They bring the cedars down the Euphrates.
Upon their return, Gilgamesh cleans himself up,
drawing the attention of the goddess Ishtar.
The princess Ishtar coveted Gilgamesh's beauty.
She said, come Gilgamesh,
you shall be my bridegroom.
Give me of your lusciousness.
You shall be my husband, shall be your wife.
She promises him great wealth and prosperity.
Gilgamesh is unmoved.
What will I get if I marry you?
You are a brazier that goes out when it freezes,
a flimsy door that keeps out neither wind nor drop,
a palace that crushes a warrior,
an elephant that knocks down its housing,
tar that smears its bearer,
water skin that soaks its bearer,
weak stone that undermines a wall,
battering ram that destroys the wall for an enemy,
shoe that pinches its wearer, yikes.
Why would he insult Ishtar in such a vicious manner?
Gilgamesh recounts her history as a lover.
Which of your lovers lasted forever?
Come, I call you to account for your lovers.
For Demuzi, your girlhood lover,
you ordained year after year of weeping.
Gilgamesh goes through a list of those
whom Ishtar fell in love,
only to bring about a terrible outcome for each.
He concludes, as for me,
now that you've fallen in love with me,
you will treat me like them?
Ishtar deeply offended and enraged,
hurries up to heaven to speak to Anu, her father.
Ishtar went sobbing before Anu,
her father before Antum, her mother,
her tears flowed down.
Father, Gilgamesh has said outrageous things about me.
Gilgamesh has been spouting insults about me,
insults and abuse against me.
She demands that her father give her the giant creature,
the bull of heaven, in order to kill Gilgamesh.
If you don't give me the bull of heaven,
I'll strike down the nether fastness,
as well as where it's inmates dwell.
I'll turn the nether regions upside down,
I'll raise the dead to devour the living,
the dead shall greatly outnumber the living.
Anu eventually agrees,
and Ishtar returns to wreak havoc on the city of Aruch.
When it reached Aruch, it dried up groves,
reed beds and marshes.
It went down to the river,
it lowered the river by seven cupids,
at the bull's snort pit opened up.
100 men of Aruch fell into it,
one after another.
In the midst of the chaos, Inkidu took action.
Inkidu sprang out and seized the bull by its horns.
The bull spewed its foam in his face,
swished dung at him with the tuft of its tail.
Having lost round one,
Inkidu rallies Gilgamesh and makes a plan
to take the bull down.
Inkidu circled around behind the bull of heaven.
He grabbed it by the tuft of its tail.
He set his foot on its hawk,
then Gilgamesh, like a strong, skillful slaughter,
rust his dagger between nape, horn and kill point.
They had defeated the bull of heaven.
At the sight, Ishtar sat on the walls of Aruch and welled,
blaming Gilgamesh for his insults and for killing the bull.
When Inkidu hear what Ishtar said,
he tore off the bull's haunch and flung it at her.
You too, if I could vanquish you, I'd treat you like this.
I draped the guts over your arms.
Not a good thing to say to a goddess.
Both Inkidu and Gilgamesh celebrated their victory,
but it was to be short lived.
Their actions had gone too far
and judgment was about to come from the gods
because they had killed the bull of heaven
and cut cedar trees down in the forest.
One of the two must die.
It is ultimately decided that it should be Inkidu,
which is revealed to Inkidu in a dream.
Inkidu laments, prays to Shamash,
then curses the hunter and the prostitute Shamhat
for their role in bringing him out of his life in the step.
May the hunter not get enough to make him a living.
Make his profit loss, cut down his stake,
may his income, his portion evaporate before you, Shamash.
Any wildlife, wherever it enters his traps,
may it go out as if it threw a window.
When he had cursed the hunter to his heart's content,
he resolved to curse the harlot Shamhat.
Come, Shamhat, I will ordain you a destiny,
a destiny that will never end forever and ever.
A long list of curses follows to which Shamash replies,
oh, Inkidu, why curse Shamhat, the harlot,
who gave you bread to eat, bit for a god,
who poured you beer, bit for a king,
who dressed you in a noble garment
and gave you handsome Gilgamesh for a comrade.
He comforts Inkidu with the knowledge
that Gilgamesh will lament his death
and bury him properly.
When Inkidu heard the speech of the valiant Shamash,
his raging heart was calmed.
He reverses his curses upon Shamhat,
pronouncing instead with blessings.
Inkidu dreams that he is to be taken to the netherworld
and although Gilgamesh attempts to persuade him
that it is not a bad omen,
Inkidu indeed falls terminally ill.
The day he had the dream, his strength ran out,
Inkidu's illness grew worse.
He called for Gilgamesh, roused him with his cry,
my friend, my god has turned against me.
Shortly thereafter, Inkidu dies.
Gilgamesh falls into a terrible state of lamentation,
calling for everyone to weep for him.
All the while, I too shall be weeping for you.
Hear me, oh young men, listen to me.
Hear me, oh elders of Uruk, listen to me.
I weep for my friend, Inkidu.
I well as bitterly as a professional keener.
What now is this sleep that has seized you?
You have faded from me, you cannot hear me.
In the moving section of the story,
Inkidu does not reply, but as for him,
he did not raise his head.
He touched his heart, but it beat no more.
Then he covered his friend's face like a brides.
He hovered around him like an eagle,
like a lioness robbed of her cubs.
He paced to and fro back and forth,
tearing out and letting fall in a heap,
the locks of his hair, ripping off
and hurling away his fine clothes like something foul.
He performs extensive funerary rites,
calling for mourning throughout the land.
And after all his lamenting,
Gilgamesh comes to a harsh realization.
Gilgamesh was weeping bitterly for Inkidu,
his friend, as he roamed the step.
I shall die too.
Shall I not then be like Inkidu?
Oh, sorrow has entered my heart.
In light of this epiphany, he makes a decision.
I have grown afraid of death, so I roamed the step.
Having come this far, I will go on swiftly
towards Utnapishtim, son of Ubar Tutu.
He will travel to the survivor of the flood
and find out how he was able to acquire eternal life.
Gilgamesh approaches the mountains where Shamash,
the sun god, comes out at sunrise.
The entrance is guarded by fearsome creatures.
The twin peaks are called Mashum.
When he arrived at the first peak called Mashum,
which daily watches over the rising of the sun,
scorpion monsters guard its portal.
Their fearsome glories are stupefying.
The sight of them is death.
Their ghastly radiance spreads over the mountain.
They watch over the sun at his rising and setting.
When Gilgamesh approaches them,
they converse with one another concerning him.
The scorpion monster called to his wife,
the one who has come to us.
His body is flesh of the gods.
The scorpion monster's wife answered him,
two thirds of him is divine.
One third is human.
The scorpion monster, the male one, called out.
Who are you?
Who have come this long way?
How have you come here before me?
How did you cross the seas, a perilous crossing?
I would learn of your journey,
the goal toward which you make your way.
I would learn of its purpose, Gilgamesh explains.
I seek the road to my forefather, Utnapishtim,
whom they call the distant one.
He who took his place among the gods
and found eternal life.
He will reveal to me the secret.
The scorpion warns him.
There was never, oh Gilgamesh, anyone like you.
No one ever entered the interior of the mountain.
Its passage is 12 double hours.
Dense is the darkness.
No light is there.
How would Gilgamesh be able to make it
through the pitch black mountain fast enough
to beat the sun before it makes its pass across the sky
and re-interests the tunnel at the opposite end?
However, he ultimately allows Gilgamesh
to enter the tunnel through the mountains.
Gilgamesh ran, hour after hour he ran,
knowing that if he were not able to exit the tunnel
before the sun entered from the other end,
he would certainly be doomed.
When he had gone 10 double hours,
the time for the sun's entry was drawing near.
When he had gone 11 double hours,
just one double hour was left.
When he had gone 12 double hours,
he came out ahead of the sun.
Having outrun the sun,
Gilgamesh makes his way through a bejeweled grove,
finally arriving at a tavern
that is situated at the edge of the sea.
And this tavern lived Siduri, the tavern keeper.
Gilgamesh strode toward her.
He was clad in a skin.
He was frightful.
He had flesh of gods in his body.
Sorrow was in his heart.
His face was like a traveler's from afar.
The tavern keeper eyed him from a distance,
speaking to herself.
She said these words.
She debated within herself.
This, I am sure, is a slaughter of wild bulls.
Wince made he straight for my door.
So fearful was his appearance
that Siduri barred her door and retreated to the roof.
Gilgamesh sees her on the roof and calls out to her.
Tavern keeper, when you saw me, why did you bar your door?
Bar your door and go up to the roof terrace.
I will strike down the door.
I will shatter the door bolt.
Gilgamesh converses with her,
telling her who he is and the mighty deeds
that he and Inky do accomplish together.
She replies, why are your cheeks emaciated?
Your face cast down.
Your spirit wretched.
Your features wasted.
Sorrow in your heart.
Your face like a traveler's from afar.
Your features weathered by cold and sun.
Why are you clad in a lion's skin, roaming the step?
Gilgamesh laments that he has lost his friend.
Inky do whom I so loved,
who went with me through every hardship.
The fate of mankind has overtaken him.
Six days and seven nights I wept for him.
I would not give him up for burial
until a worm fell out of his nose.
Inky do my friend whom I loved is turned into clay.
Shall I too not lie down like him
and never give it up
and never get up forever and ever?
Siduri's words were to the point,
Gilgamesh, wherefore do you wander?
The eternal life you are seeking, you shall not find.
When the gods created mankind,
they established death for mankind
and withheld eternal life for themselves.
She does have some words of encouragement, however.
As for you Gilgamesh, let your stomach be full.
Always be happy, night and day.
Make every day a delight.
Night and day, play and dance.
Your clothes should be clean.
Your head should be washed.
You should bathe in water.
Look proudly on the little one holding your hand.
Let your mate always be blissful in your loins.
This then is the work of mankind.
He who is alive should be happy.
Gilgamesh is undeterred.
However, he demands to know the way to the flood survivor.
Gilgamesh, there has never been a way across.
No one from the dawn of time has ever crossed this sea.
She explains how treacherous the crossing is.
The water kills whoever touches it.
The only one who crossed it.
The boatman, Ur-Shinabi, a stone man
who pushed the boat through the water
who are unaffected by the lethal water.
Go, show yourself to him.
If possible, cross with him.
If not, turn back.
Rashli Gilgamesh finds Ur-Shinabi and his stone man
and makes a tragic mistake.
He crept forward, went down toward them.
Like an arrow, he dropped among them.
His battle cry resounded in the forest.
Ur-Shinabi took up arms to defend himself,
but Gilgamesh was too powerful for him.
The boatman questions the attacker.
Why are your cheeks emaciated?
Your face cast down.
Your spirit wretched.
Your features wasted.
Sorrow in your heart.
Your face like a traveler's from afar.
Your features weathered by cold and sun.
Why are you clad in a lion's skin roaming the steppe?
Gilgamesh laments Inki-Doo's death
and his current fear of death.
Six days and seven nights wept for him.
He would not give him up for burial
until a worm fell out of his nose.
I was frightened.
I have grown afraid of dying.
So I roamed the steppe.
Shall I too not lie down like him
and never get up forever and ever?
Gilgamesh then implores Ur-Shinabi
to tell him the way to Utnapishtim,
the survivor of the worldwide flood
who gained eternal life.
Ur-Shinabi said to him to Gilgamesh,
your own hands have foiled you.
Gilgamesh, you have smashed the stone charms.
You have thrown them into a channel.
The stone charms are smashed
and the cedar has not been picked.
Oh, the irony.
The stone men who were able to traverse the waters of death
unaffected have been smashed to bits by Gilgamesh's own hands.
And they were destroyed before they were able
to cut long cedar poles that could be used
as punting poles to make it through the waters.
Ur-Shinabi offers a solution.
Gilgamesh, raise the axe in your hand.
Go down into the forest.
Cut me five times 60 poles,
each five times 12 cupids long.
Dress them, set on knobs,
bring them to me and load them on the boat.
The king is able to go cut long punting poles
in order to move the boat through the deadly waters
without touching them.
After he creates the poles,
they board the boat and Gilgamesh,
one pole at a time pushes the boat forward
as far as the pole will allow
until he simply drops it into the water.
So as not to touch any of the water
by pulling the punting pole back up.
However, they eventually ran out of poles
and Gilgamesh stripped down using his massive body,
held his clothing up,
creating a type of cell out of his body and clothing.
Ultimately, however, Gilgamesh was able
to traverse the waters of death.
As Ur-Shinabi and Gilgamesh approached Utnapishtim,
the flood survivors puzzled concerning who is approaching.
Why have the stone charms belonging to the boat been smashed?
And not one its master embarked thereon.
He who comes here is no man of mine,
but at his right, my man is standing.
I can see that he is no man of mine.
I can see that he is no God.
I can see that two thirds of him is divine.
One third is human.
When they arrive, Gilgamesh explains to Utnapishtim
why he roams the step in a seeking eternal life.
I said to myself, I will go to Utnapishtim,
the distant one of whom they tell.
But Utnapishtim sees his actions as foolish.
He has been blessed greatly by the gods.
Why does he roam around, wearing himself out to no end?
You strive ceaselessly, what do you gain?
When you wear out your strength in ceaseless striving,
when you torture your limbs with pain,
you hasten the end of your days.
Mankind whose descendants are snapped off
like reeds in a cane break.
The handsome young man, the lovely young woman,
death will robe them all too soon.
No one sees death.
No one sees the face of death.
No one hears the voice of death,
but cruel death cuts off mankind.
Gilgamesh responds that he and Utnapishtim
are not so different.
How did he gain eternal life?
As I look upon you, Utnapishtim, your limbs are not different.
You are just as I am.
Indeed, you are not different at all.
You are just as I am.
You then, how did you join the ranks of the gods
and find eternal life?
It is here that Utnapishtim reveals
that his immortality came as a result
of the worldwide flood that he was chosen to survive.
I will reveal to you, O Gilgamesh,
a secret matter and a mystery of the gods I will tell you.
The city Sharupak, a city yourself have knowledge of,
which once was set on the bank of the Euphrates.
That same city was ancient and gods once were within it.
The great gods resolved to send the deluge.
All of the gods swore an oath
that they would not tell the humans
about their decision to destroy all humanity.
However, the god Ea, who determined to save some humans,
came up with a plan that would allow him
to keep his oath to the gods,
but still save a handful of humans.
Their leader, Ea, was sworn with them.
He repeated their plans to the reed fence.
Reed fence, reed fence, wall.
Listen, O reed fence, pay attention, O wall.
Brilliant, Ea was forbidden to tell any human,
but he was not restricted from telling a reed fence
about the destructive plans of the gods.
If by chance a human was within earshot,
that was not Ea's fault.
Ea speaks the following words to the reed fence.
Oh man of Sharupak, son of Ubar Tutu,
wreck house, build boat,
forsake possessions and seek life.
Belongings reject and life thave.
Take aboard the boat seed of all living thing.
Utenapishtim asks what he should tell the people.
Ea responds, then you shall speak to them thus.
I am sure that Inlil has come to dislike me.
I shall not dwell in your city.
I shall not even set my food on the dry land of Inlil.
I shall descend to the watery depths
and dwell with my Lord Ea.
Upon you he shall shower down in abundance,
a windfall of birds, a surprise of fishes.
He shall pour upon you a harvest of riches.
In the morning, cakes and spates.
In the evening, grains and rains.
The people of the city were thus tricked
into helping Utenapishtim build the boat.
And he prepares a great feast for them.
Finally the time came for him to board the boat.
Whatever I had loaded up upon her,
what silver I had loaded upon her,
what gold I had loaded upon her,
I sit up on board all my family and kin.
Beasts of the steppe, wild animals of the steppe.
All types of skilled craftsmen I sent up on board.
Then came the storm.
At the first glimmer of dawn,
a black cloud rose over the horizon.
Inside it, Adad was thundering.
While the destroying gods Shulut and Hanish went in front,
Adad's awesome power passed over the heavens.
Whatever was bright was turned into gloom.
He charged over the land like an ox.
He smashed it like a clay pot.
For one day the storm went blue, swiftly it blew.
The flood came forth.
The onslaught passed over the people like a battle.
No one could see the one next to him.
People could not recognize each other in the downpour.
The intensity of the storm was great enough
even to terrify the gods themselves.
The gods became frightened of the deluge.
They shrank back, went up to Anu's highest heaven.
The gods cowered like dogs, slinking in the open.
Belet-Ili lamented,
how could I have spoken up for an evil deed
in the assembly of the gods
and spoken up for an attack to destroy my people?
It is I who bring them into the world.
They are my people.
Now, like so many fish, they choke up the sea.
The storm continued for six days and seven nights.
Then came to an end on the seventh day.
Surveying what had happened,
Utnapishtim said, I looked at the weather.
Stillness reigned and the whole human race
had turned into clay.
He weeps for the death and destruction,
then looks around and sees land coming into view.
The boat had come to rest on Mount Nimush.
Mount Nimush held the boat fast, not letting it move.
For six days, he waited, anchored to Mount Nimush,
then investigated how much the water had receded.
When the seventh day arrived,
I brought out a dove and set it free.
The dove swore off in search of food.
No landing place appeared for it, so it came back.
I brought out a swallow and set it free.
The swallow swore off in search of food.
No landing place appeared to it, so it came back.
I brought out a raven and set it free.
The raven swore off and saw the ebbing of the waters.
It ate, scratched, and bobbed its head
so it did not come back.
It was time to disembark.
Utnapishtim came off the ark
and made offerings to the gods.
The gods smelt the savor.
The gods smelt the sweet savor.
The gods crowded around the sacrificer like flies.
Belay Elie speaks to the other gods,
holding out a necklace as a symbol.
Oh gods, these shall be my lapis necklace, lest I forget.
I shall be mindful of these days and not forget, not ever.
The gods should come to the incense offering,
but inlil should not come to the incense offering
because he brought the flood without thinking
and marked my people for destruction.
Inlil arrives and is enraged.
From where has a living creature escaped?
No man was to survive destruction.
Quickly becomes a clear that Aya is responsible.
And he pulls no punches with Inlil.
You, O valiant one, the wisest of the gods,
how could you have brought on the flood without thinking?
Punished the wrongdoer for his wrongdoing,
punished the transgressor for his transgression.
He charges Inlil with wrongdoing himself,
but leaves it to Inlil to decide what to do
with Utnapishtim.
Then Inlil came up into the boat, leading me by my hands.
He brought me out.
He brought up my wife.
At her kneel beside me, he touched our brows,
stood between us to bless us.
Hitherto, Utnapishtim has been a human being.
Now Utnapishtim and his wife shall become like us gods.
Utnapishtim shall dwell for distant,
a mouth of the rivers.
From that day forward, the survivor of the flood
had been set far reaches of the world,
there to live forever.
But this brings Utnapishtim back to Gilgamesh.
This was how he gained eternal life.
But what about Gilgamesh?
Now then, who will convene the gods for your sake?
You may find the eternal life you seek.
The answer, no one.
To show that impossible position Gilgamesh was in,
in his attempt to defeat death,
he issues the king a challenge.
Can he even defeat sleep?
Come now, try not to sleep for six days and seven nights.
If he wouldn't be able to even defeat sleep,
how much less death itself?
As Gilgamesh sat there on his haunches,
sleep was swirling over him like a myth.
Utnapishtim said to her to his wife,
behold, this fellow who wanted eternal life,
sleep swirls over him like a mist.
His wife implores Utnapishtim to wake him
and send him on his way.
But Utnapishtim fears that Gilgamesh will not believe
that he has actually fallen asleep.
Since the human race is duplicitous,
he'll endeavor to dupe you.
Come now, bake his daily loaves,
put them one after another by his head,
then marked the wall for each day
he has slept.
The plan was to bake a loaf of bread each day
that Gilgamesh slept as a sort of visual timekeeping device.
When he awoke and saw all the moldy
and stale loaves of bread,
he would be able to see that he had slept
for quite some time.
When Gilgamesh awakes, as Utnapishtim predicted,
he tried to say he hadn't slept for more than a moment.
Scarcely had sleep stolen over me.
When straight away, you touched me and roused me,
pointing to the seven loaves of bread.
However, Utnapishtim was able to demonstrate
how long he had been asleep.
Gilgamesh laments, oh, should I carry on?
Utnapishtim, wherever should I go?
Now that the bereaver has taken hold of my flesh,
death lurks in my bed chamber.
Wherever I turn, there is death.
Gilgamesh then cleans himself up
and the king prepares to return to Uruk.
Utnapishtim's wife, however,
asked her husband to tell the king
about the secret plant of life.
I will reveal to you, oh, Gilgamesh,
a secret matter and a mystery of the gods I will tell you.
There is a certain plant.
It's shaped like a thorn bush.
Its thorns are like the wild rose
and will prick your hand.
If you can secure this plant, when you eat it,
you will return to how you were in your youth.
Rilled at such news, Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet
and plunges into the waters in search of the plant.
Success, he finds the plant.
Per shinabi, this plant is a cure for heartache,
whereby a man can regain his vitality.
I will take it to ramparded Uruk.
I will have an old man eat some and so test the plant.
He then embarks on the long journey home,
eager to test out the plant on an aging old man
from his city.
On their way back, Gilgamesh stops by a pool of water
to take a bath.
He went down into it to bathe in the water.
A snake caught the scent of the plant.
Stealthily it came up and carried the plant away.
On its way back, it shed its skin.
No!
Gilgamesh had immortality in his hand
and it was taken away by a snake.
Thereupon Gilgamesh sat down weeping,
his tears streaming down his face.
He said to Urshanabi, the boatman,
for whom Urshanabi have my arms been toiling?
For whom has my heart's blood been poured out?
For myself, I have obtained
no benefit I have done a good deed or a reptile.
At the very end of the epic, Gilgamesh makes it back to Uruk.
Quite intentionally, the writer ends the story
in the same way that he began it.
Gilgamesh said to him, to Urshanabi, the boatman,
go up Urshanabi, pace out the walls of Uruk,
study the foundation terrace
and examine the brickwork.
Is not its masonry of kiln-fired brick?
And did not seven masters lay its foundations?
One square mile of city, one square mile of gardens,
one square mile of clay pits,
a half square mile of Ishtar's dwelling,
three and a half square miles is the measure of Uruk.
Although this may seem like an odd place to end the story,
by closing the epic so similarly to how it began,
it employed a literary device that brings the reader back
to the beginning of the story, to begin it again.
The epic in some ways continues on indefinitely.
And this was the message of the story itself.
Gilgamesh did indeed discover how to gain a type
of immortality by having his story told again and again.
He finally realized that although he could not live forever
in his mortal body, his deeds, his achievements
and the memory of his works would bring about
a type of eternal life for the king of Uruk.
Gilgamesh and the Bible.
Now that you know the gist of the epic of Gilgamesh,
we should discuss a bit of history
and some interesting elements which overlap with the Bible.
Shortly after beginning his excavation at Nimrod,
Austin Henry Laird uncovered the first
of eight Assyrian palaces dating
from the ninth to seventh centuries BCE at Nimrod and Nineveh.
He and his assistant marveled at rooms adorned
with stone barlalf depicting demons, gods, battles
and royal ceremonies as well as doorways guarded
by giant winged bulls and lions.
They also discovered tens of thousands
of cuneiform inscribed clay tablets,
the ancient libraries of Assyrian kings
like Senecharib and Ashurbanipal.
Though Laird's methods were more akin
to treasure hunting than modern archeology,
his efforts unveiled a major Mesopotamian civilization
under challenging conditions.
Many of Laird's most dramatic finds were sent
to the British Museum, captivating Victorian audiences
with their connections to biblical history.
By the early 1850s, advancements
and deciphering Assyrian Babylonian cuneiform
linked the artifacts to historical figures and events,
including Jehu, the ninth century BCE king of Israel
and Senecharib's Siege of Lakhish.
Laird's book, Nineveh and Its Remains, 1849,
was held as a monumental achievement
and celebrated widely.
The name Akkadian is derived from the city state of Akkad
near present day Baghdad, founded in the middle
of the third millennium BCE and capital
of one of the first great empires in human history.
By 2000 BCE, Akkadian had supplanted Sumerian
as the major spoken language of Mesopotamia
and around this time, it split into two dialects,
Babylonian, which was spoken in southern Mesopotamia
and Assyrian, which was spoken in the north.
In his 1876 work, The Chaldean Account of Genesis,
George Smith describes a pivotal moment during his research.
Upon examining the third column of a text,
he identifies a speech made by the Deluge hero,
which he initially attributed to a figure named
Eid's Zubar, later understood to be Gilgamesh,
although his initial interpretation
of the Cuneiform was incorrect.
Recalling a related legend about Eid's Zubar,
Smith compares and confirms its connection
to the same narrative series.
This insight propels him into an exhaustive search
among thousands of fragmented tablets,
despite the fragments being minute and often indecipherable.
His determination pays off as he manages
to uncover additional pieces of the Eid Zubar legends,
a task both arduous and fruitful.
These discoveries shock the world
with a much earlier version of the flood myth
than that of Noah.
Much more can be said of its discovery
and subsequent discoveries,
but let's go over some parallels to the Bible.
The contexts are different,
but the overlap is enough to seriously consider.
We find stories with immortality hanging
over the mortal's head like a mistletoe,
a garden where the gods dwell near or on mountains,
and even create wild man from a pinch of clay,
who dwells with animals until a woman comes along
and tames his wild nature making him civil.
Stories where tests of morality take central place
from taking advantage of women
and two men fall in love
with one another becoming best friends.
We have stories with divine judgment
on the civilized cities and snakes
taking the symbol of rebirth or eternal life
away from the man.
These stories share so many elements
that it's really hard not to think the Bible
is giving a nod to the earlier epic of Gilgamesh.
The most famous parallel
between the epic of Gilgamesh and the Bible
is the flood narrative.
Key elements of the flood narratives.
Divine communication.
In both stories,
a divine figure communicates the imminent destruction
to a chosen individual.
In the epic of Gilgamesh, the God Ea or Inki,
warns Utnapishtim about the God's decision
to send a flood to destroy humanity.
In the Bible, God warns Noah of his plan
to flood the earth due to the wickedness of humans.
Both Utnapishtim and Noah are instructed
to build a large boat.
Utnapishtim builds a cube-shaped arc
according to the God's measurements.
While Noah builds an arc of specific dimensions
as instructed by God,
both steal their arcs with pitch.
These arcs are meant to preserve life.
Both heroes are told to bring aboard
their family and various animals.
This element highlights the theme of preservation
and continuity of life post-custastrophe.
The flood itself is a cataclysmic event in both stories.
Representing divine retribution,
but also a cleansing and a new beginning.
It lasts for several days and covers the earth,
wiping out all life except for those on the arc.
In both accounts, the hero's vessel lands upon a mountain.
After the waters begin to recede,
both heroes release birds to find out whether the water
has retreated enough to reveal the land.
The sequence of birds and their actions,
particularly sending of a dove,
which eventually returns with a sign of new life
and olive branch in the Bible is remarkably similar.
Post-flood, both narratives feature a form of covenant.
Utnapishtim is granted immortality by the gods
as a reward for his obedience and survival.
In Genesis, God makes a covenant with Noah,
promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again
and gives a rainbow as a sign of this covenant.
In both accounts, the gods smell the sweet aroma
of the burnt offering and it softens their wrath.
When the great gods decide to send the flood,
two lines that occur later in tablet 11
imply that the inlil's motivation
was to punish men's evil doing.
Do not allow all men to die because of the sins of some,
like punish the guilty, but not the innocent.
In this, it resembles the Noah story,
both in the J version and in the P version.
Now when the Lord saw how great the evil of humans was
and how every impulse in their hearts
was nothing but evil all the time,
he was sorry that he had made humans on the earth
and he was pained in his heart.
And he said, I will destroy all humankind from the earth.
I am sorry I ever made them, Genesis 6, 5, 7.
And the earth was exceedingly corrupt
and filled with violence.
And when God saw how corrupt the earth was
and how corrupt humankind had become on the earth,
God said to Noah, I'm going to put an end to humankind
for the earth is filled with violence because of them.
I'm going to blot them out from the earth.
Genesis 6, 11 or 13.
The Atrahasis however, in its sublimely ridiculous way,
provides the following motivation.
The earth was too full, the people too numerous.
The land was bellowing like a wild bull.
Enlil said to the other great gods,
the noise of humans has become too loud.
Their constant uproar is keeping me awake.
Slippery snakes.
Gilgamesh and the plant of rejuvenation.
In the epic of Gilgamesh after a long and perilous quest,
Gilgamesh obtains a plant that has the power
to restore youth.
The plant represents a tangible form of immortality,
chance for Gilgamesh to bring back something
of eternal value to his people.
However, while Gilgamesh bathes,
a snake steals the plant, consumes it,
and immediately sheds its skin,
symbolizing its own renewal and rebirth.
This incident highlights the elusive nature
of immortality for humans and the natural cycle of renewal
that some creatures like the snake possess.
The snake's role here is almost trickster-like,
though it acts more as a force of nature
that inadvertently teaches Gilgamesh a lesson
about the human condition and the inevitability
of aging and death, Adam, Eve, and the serpent.
In the Genesis narrative, the serpent is depicted
as a cunning creature that tempts Eve
to eat from the forbidden tree of knowledge of good and evil,
contrary to God's direct command.
The serpent's role is more explicitly malevolent
compared to its neutral natural role in Gilgamesh.
It represents disobedience
and the introduction of sin into the world.
By convincing Eve to eat the fruit,
the serpent sets into motion the events
that lead to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden
and the divine pronouncement
that humans will not have access to the tree of life,
thus denying them immortality.
In this story, the serpent is a catalyst for knowledge
and the complex moral and ethical lives
that Adam and Eve will now lead,
which includes an awareness of mortality.
I'm reminded of the Adapamith,
where he goes to meet Anu and engages
with the serpent dragon deity, Ningish Zeda.
Check out some of the images of this deity, Ningish Zeda.
Divine Gardens.
Both texts reference lush divine gardens.
In the Epic of Gilgamesh, there's a mention
of gardens of the gods filled with jewels and plants.
The Bible describes the Garden of Eden,
a perfect place created by God
with every kind of beautiful and fruitful tree.
You were in the garden, the Garden of God.
Every precious stone was your covering,
the ruby, the topaz and the diamond,
the barrel, the onyx and the jasper,
the lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald
and the gold, the workmanship of your settings
and sockets was in you.
On the day that you were created, they were prepared.
Divine Retribution and Catastrophes.
Both texts contain themes of divine retribution
leading to catastrophic events.
For instance, the flood narrative in both traditions
is a divine response to human wickedness or loudness.
Additionally, in the Epic of Gilgamesh,
the city of Uruk faces the wrath of the gods
through various events similar to the destruction
of cities like Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible
due to their inhabitants' immorality.
Inkidu and the Animals.
In the Epic of Gilgamesh,
Inkidu is initially described as a wild man
created by the gods from clay
to be a counterpart for Gilgamesh.
He lives among the animals in the wilderness,
drinking at the waterholes with the gazelles
and freeing animals from traps set by hunters.
Inkidu is completely integrated with the animal world
until his human qualities are awakened by a woman.
Adam and the Animals.
In the Bible, Adam is the first man created by God
from the dust of the ground.
Before the creation of Eve,
Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden
asked with naming all the animals.
This establishes his dominion over them
but also underscores his initial companionship with them,
indicating a harmonious existence within the animal kingdom.
Once Eve comes on the scene,
Adam doesn't appear to be a companion of the animals anymore.
For both characters,
the introduction of a woman marked a pivotal turning point.
Inkidu's transition from his wild state begins
when he encounters Shamhat,
a temple prostitute sent by the gods.
After spending time with Shamhat,
Inkidu becomes aware of his own humanity.
This interaction leads him to leave the wilderness
for human civilization,
fundamentally changing his life and destiny.
Similarly, Adam's solitary existence changes
when God creates Eve from one of his ribs.
Eve is introduced as a companion for Adam,
marking the beginning of his human society, so to speak.
Her creation is pivotal for the narrative
of human development and moral challenges,
much like Shamhat's role in awaking Inkidu's humanity
and leading him to a new phase of life.
Now, Inkidu, you know what it is to be with a woman.
To unite with her, you are beautiful.
You are like a God.
Literally, you are handsome.
Inkidu, you are like a God.
The context seems to indicate understanding
rather than beauty.
One can't help comparing the words
of the serpent in the Garden of Eden.
As soon as you eat from it, your eyes will be opened
and you will be like gods,
knowing good and evil.
Genesis three, verse five.
Gilgamesh loves Inkidu, and David loves Jonathan.
The relationship dynamics between Gilgamesh and Inkidu
and the Epic of Gilgamesh, and David and Jonathan
in the Hebrew Bible have often been explored by scholars
for their deep emotional bonds,
which some interpret as having homoerotic undertones.
Both pairs share intense and intimate relationships
that are central to their respective stories,
reflecting profound connections beyond simple friendship.
In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the relationship
between Gilgamesh and Inkidu
is one of the narrative's central elements.
Inkidu is initially created by the gods
as a rival to Gilgamesh, but upon meeting,
they become close companions.
Their friendship is depicted as deeply intimate
and transformative, particularly for Gilgamesh,
who mourns Inkidu's death with profound grief
that leads him on a quest for immortality.
Their bond is described in terms that suggest
a deep emotional and possibly physical intimacy.
They embrace and kiss after their initial conflict.
Gilgamesh grieves for Inkidu like a spouse,
using language that is typically reserved
for the loss of a loved one in a conjugal sense.
Gilgamesh's lament for Inkidu is filled with an intensity
that echoes romantic or familial love.
In the Hebrew Bible, the relationship
between David and Jonathan is similarly characterized
by deep emotional ties.
Jonathan, the son of King Saul, forms an immediate bond
with David, and their friendship becomes a defining part
of both of their lives.
The biblical texts contain several passages
that highlight the depth of their connection.
Jonathan and David make a covenant
because Jonathan loves him as his own soul
or Samuel 18, one through three.
Jonathan strips himself of his robe
and armor to give to David, symbolizing his loyalty
and perhaps a deeper emotional bond.
Upon learning of Jonathan's death,
David laments with a profound grief,
describing Jonathan's love as wonderful,
surpassing the love of women.
Second Samuel 1, 26.
Jonathan and David kissed each other
in a context where Jonathan's father Saul
was trying to kill David.
Death is prevalent theme in this,
as well as the Inkidu relationship with Gilgamesh.
Verse Samuel 20, verse 41.
There are many subtle examples of comparisons with the Bible,
but we will just give one example.
Ecclesiastes 9, 7 through 10.
Go, eat your food with gladness
and drink your wine with a joyful heart
for God has already approved what you do.
Always be clothed in white.
Always anoint your head with oil.
Enjoy life with your wife whom you love
all the days of this meaningless life
that God has given you under the sun.
All your meaningless days,
but this is your lot in life
and in your toil some labor under the sun.
Whatever your hand finds to do,
do it with all your might.
In the realm of the dead where you are going,
there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge
nor wisdom.
Epic, tablet 10, lines 82 to 92.
As for you Gilgamesh, let your stomach be full.
Always be happy, night and day.
Make every day a delight.
Night and day, play and dance.
Your clothes should be clean.
Your head should be washed.
You should bathe in water.
Put proudly on the little one holding your hand.
Let your mate always be blissful in your loins.
This then is the work of mankind.
He who is alive should be happy.
I personally don't find it fair
that we need to use the Bible
in order to make the Epic of Gilgamesh popular
or interesting to so many online.
After reading it for myself,
I can see exactly why the story
would have influenced the biblical stories.
It hits a note-brainer.
My hope is that you go read it for yourself
and try to understand the depth it has to offer us today.
I hope more people will begin to cherish stories like this
as much as others have cherished the Bible.
There are so many rich narratives
that have so much to offer us
and this Epic is at the top of the list.
