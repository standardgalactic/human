you. Interesting. Thank you so
much. So shifting gears a
little here. I was a full
preterist. You I've said this
to you before right. Yeah and I
know you get the I feel bad for
you look in your eye. I'm just
we're jumping the revelation
here okay. Yeah because it's
like you know how I do you I
don't mean to do you dirty
yeah it's like my PhD exam
alright bring it on.
I just I want to point out
that like when I was a Christian
I wanted to protect Jesus I was
kind of an apologist I studied
under a guy who studied under
Norman Geisler and I was
sincere in trying to protect
my faith and if it's true you
know I should be able to prove
it well over the years I
was a Calvinist because I
recognized this whole predestinarian
stuff in like Paul Romans 9 I
just prepared for destruction
vessels prepared for you know and
the way I started to interpret
this through the Protestant you
know Calvinistic view I became
a Presbyterian but then I found out
I needed to study eschatology Dr.
Ehrman and one of the things that
kept coming up is there's clear
indication of time statements that
the end is nigh they're saying get
out mellow the Greek word mellow
floats all over the place so I
started going well hold on Paul
Jesus everyone's saying it's about
to happen I'm a Christian in
2016 how
in the world am I going to tell
that these people these men who are
teaching a church they know better
than the Bible they know better than
Jesus they know better than Paul
so I found myself in this tough spot
as a Christian where I was like
how can I be right in the whole church
that Jesus said and Paul said
they're not liars I can't
say he's a false prophet so I
thought it had to happen and this
is what full preterism teaches so they
say it did happen the synoptic
gospels right that the destruction
of the temple happened and they say
that's the evidence of the end the
end that Paul thought the end that
the book of Revelation is teaching the
end that Mark Matthew Luke John
you know John's really realized eschatology
but I just say that what they do is they
all the New Testament is pointing to
the destruction of the Jerusalem
temple as the end the resurrection
the final judgment everything
because you can't go past that
you know Jesus's own words
I'm a fundamentalist ex evangelical
right
my question is
it's this long thing I wanted to build up
can you take down
that idea
with me here on this episode can you
help me see why it didn't
happen and how it failed
well is it your sense that
everybody who ever died was raised from
the dead in the year 70
the way they interpreted
resurrection of course
it depends on who you talk to of course
they say well resurrection is covenant
resurrection it's not
literal physical you know
you think you think that's what Jews
thought when they said the term resurrection
I would say yeah
no you can you can look
of course you know a lot of time
over history the preterist view hasn't
been the year 70
it's been events that transpired over
the course of history
but
because they didn't like the idea of setting dates
and so they said well actually it's happened already
and so the persecution
of Nero is the first
is the first horse of the
horsemen of the apocalypse and then
and you kind of go through and then
Constantine's conversion is that you know
like you trace the whole history that way
but it's a way
it's also a way of salvaging the fact
that it's predicting something that didn't
happen and for
for probably very
conservative evangelicals and fundamentalists
the idea that it happened in 70
is attractive because then
yeah but you know
the
the early Christians didn't think that that was
the fulfillment of it
2nd Peter was probably
written 50 years after 70
written around the year 120 and it's trying
to explain why God
said it's going to be soon when it didn't happen
soon and it came
up with explanations that are things that
you know people would be familiar with you know that
with the Lord of Days as a thousand years
and a thousand years as a day so if
you say it's going to happen in three days what you mean
is going to happen in 3,000 years and so
or you know and the reason
it hasn't happened is because God that was the plan
God was just you know he's trying to get you to repent
and you haven't done it so he's going to extend the time
for a while but it's still going to be soon
and so you know you so you come up so
you know he's not lying about it he's just like
he's changing the timetable to give you a chance
to repent so you so there are all sorts
of explanations but I don't see anything
in the year 70 that makes you think
that the kingdom of God came to earth
I mean and that
the dead were resurrected and
that the heavenly Jerusalem came down
and that is like I don't see it
it's it's 15 it's
1500 miles long
and wide by the way this Jerusalem was
paid streets paid with gold
and probably gates and I've traveled
around the country I haven't seen it
so so you have to what you have
to do is say it doesn't really mean it literally
but once you say he doesn't mean
it literally what then
binds you what what
then what what then
constrains your interpretation why can't
you just come up with anything right
if it's not literal why not say
oh you know actually it happened
in the year 45
because that was the year that
you know it's like just make up a year
which people still do today of course
you know when people predict that
you know when when somebody will say
the end's gonna come on you know
March 12th on in the year
1993
and it doesn't come then they say
oh it actually did come but nobody noticed
didn't
didn't that happen with the millerite movement
yeah
yeah well yeah and
and others since then
very very rarely does somebody
say okay it's gonna happen on June 19th
and then it doesn't happen they say
yeah I made a mistake sorry
bad my bad
Harold camping did that by the way
he predicted the actual
date it didn't happen then he said
I was off by six months and six months
didn't happen and he said
that's wrong
like that doesn't happen
so one thing in first
first Colossians
if you will five to six
I'm sorry maybe it's just Colossians
sorry not first Colossians Colossians
Colossians five to six I'm gonna read it
if you don't mind and get you to maybe give your thoughts
the faith and love that spring
from the hope stored up for you in heaven
and about which you have already
heard in the true message of the gospel
that has come to you in the same
way the gospel is bearing fruit and growing
throughout the whole world
just as it has been doing among
you since the day you heard it and truly understood
God's grace so
the idea is that
Paul ostensibly believed
that the gospel had past tense
already gone out to the
whole world hence the end was nigh
and there was no need for further evangelizing
a lot of the people who are
70 AD
doctrine they'll look at the gospels
and there's this list of like signs
right they're like okay well we know that the temple's destruction
is one of these signs
I see that as ex-event too
prophecy even if someone said it was gonna fall
the way they wrote it
is very meticulously detailed
so if some guy predicted it was gonna
come down like tons of people were saying hey this temple
is coming down you're messing with the Romans or whatever
that to me is not magical
or you have to believe in a miracle
to think that happened my point is they look
at all these details and then they say and the
end is not yet but it's like
about to happen and that the gospel will be
preached to the whole world
is one of those signs so they run to Paul
their chronology they don't really care
about chronology they just say the bible teaches
the bible and they go Paul believed
that the gospel has been preached to the
whole world already
can you like
tell us how that doesn't work
because from what I understand Paul's heading
to Spain he's on his
way to still preach the gospel that had
already been preached to the whole world
it doesn't make sense to me
well it doesn't really make sense
and for one thing Paul probably didn't
write Colossians it's one of the books that he
probably didn't write and so it's somebody
writing later but
Paul does use
that kind of language when it doesn't make
any sense for him to be Paul himself
he says he's going to Spain
in Rome in Romans that's where he talks about
it and he says that he's going to Spain
because he's finished up his work
in the
eastern part of the Roman Empire
I mean
I don't know how many churches he founded
we know it was due
but he certainly
didn't
but he said the gospel
has been preached here I'm going to
finish it off by going to Spain
either he doesn't have a very good sense of
geography or he's prone to exaggeration
or
he thinks that what has to happen
is like
churches have to be planted in regions
and they're going to grow from there
so he's done the job planting and so now
and so now it's all done
you know it'll be all done and then Jesus will come
back
so
but I don't quite see how that's evidence
for the year 70
right
yeah
Act 17 in the past got overlooked
such ignorance is 30
31
but now he commands all people everywhere to repent
for he has said a day when he will judge
the world with justice by the man he
has appointed he has given proof of this
to everyone by raising him from the dead
so this this right here
to me is obvious
it says what it says but for
some this is 70 AD
judgment and every man
everywhere or all to repent
everywhere are only the elect
so they take a Calvinistic
approach to
a 70 AD doctrine and you end up with
this very limited concept
to me
I don't see that so
I don't understand
how does Act 17 have to do with the year 70
well when you
paint this picture the end is supposed to happen
in 70 they everything
is kind of forced into that
yeah but what about Act 17 makes you think
about the destruction of Jerusalem
in the year 70 judgment
so they equate judgment the final judgment
or judgment of the world
they think the world means covenant world
it's talking about the old covenant Israel
which is what was yeah everything's about that
and so what would you recommend
to someone who's maybe really open minded
and they just been taught this
like I was
I just tell and read the text
it doesn't say anything about Jerusalem being destroyed
I mean it's got nothing to do with the Roman war
the fact it says judgment
what if you put something besides
the Roman war in the year 70
for the judgment right
so you translate judgment as the destruction of Jerusalem
why not say the invasion of the Martians
every time it says judgment
it means that the Martians are going to come in
and so that's what it's talking about
and so you read Act 17
see it's talking about the Martians
what I mean
just read the text the text says nothing about
Martians or the destruction of Rome
I don't get it
why would you be in Athens
to Epicureans and Stoics
according to that narrative
that's what I'm saying the whole context has nothing to do
with the destruction of Jerusalem
it actually is not that
straightforward of a passage
it's a very complicated passage
I had a PhD student
one of my early PhD students read an entire book
on this passage
because it's complicated
in interesting ways
but one of the notable things
is that
he's preaching to these philosophers
and
what he says about
his gospel message runs
contrary to what Paul himself says
in the book of Romans
in this book
in this book
he says you read the part that everybody's ignorant
and so they don't know any better
and so there's judgment coming
Romans says no, nobody's ignorant
they know exactly what's going on
so you've got tensions with Paul
in this passage but destruction of Jerusalem
is not one of them
that's what I thought
and it's just people
that I've come from
it's interesting
there's a lot of that
that goes on in the crowds that I'm aware of
from where I came out of
because we were trying to justify the Bible
but if you say judgment means the year 70
then any time the word judgment appears
you'll think the year 70
why would you interpret it that way
that's a good point
because if you look at the Second Temple Judaism literature
like when judgment comes up
it's not talking about 70
it's not talking about that at all
so why aren't we using
a broader vocabulary
if I can use the term for other books
to kind of get the idea like judgment
destruction of the world, all that kind of stuff
is common in these apocalyptic
texts and not just apocalyptic texts
I mean in the Old Testament
you have judgment happening all the time
but that's the point
they'll say it's judgment of like
Babylon
or an empire or a region or something
never world cataclysmic
and so they never see it
well that's the apocalyptic dimension
I mean sometimes it is cataclysmic
but in the Old Testament
but in apocalyptic thought
it definitely is cataclysmic
and the destruction of Jerusalem
in the year 70 was not cataclysmic
it destroyed Jerusalem
like most Jews in the world
it affected people who lived in Jerusalem
and so to say that this is the
like the end of history as we know it
is predicted by Jesus where the sun goes dark
and the moon turns to blood
it's like no
that is when people raised from the dead
and the kingdom of God come
no that is not 70
people might be told that
but it's like where does it come from
good point
I've got one of the gentlemen
who holds to a position called Israel only
this is why
Jason Staples work was really interesting
to me is to try and learn more
about the understanding of Israel
and what is Paul doing right
so here's one of the questions that he asks
if according to the story
the New Testament and maybe even the old
if you want to take in the whole picture
the New Testament end was the end of the old
covenant religious system
and the temple community
and that the end happened in 80 70
what was first century non-Israelites
need salvation
either before or after 80 70
so what would any non-Israelite
need salvation for
the paradigm is that
salvation is only for
Israelites so why would a
non-Israelite ever need salvation
they'll say stuff like
the law was given to Israel
and no one else
so technically no one else needed salvation
what does this person mean by the
term salvation
the question
it's not defined here in particular
but I think it's a salvation from the
old covenant system
so they think the old covenant
is what they're being saved from
and then of course
being put into the new covenant
and a lot of them will say
only those who are under the old covenant
could technically enter into the new
according to whom
according to Paul
Paul I believe
you know why did Paul say
that Gentiles don't have to keep
circumcision
I think that they have the
apocalyptic timetable at mind
where Paul's like come as you are
the end's about to happen anyways
that kind of mindset where the end is about to happen
but only for Israelites he said
right
but Paul doesn't preach to Israelites
his whole point is salvation goes to
Gentile
that is kind of they take the
you know Jason Staples thesis all too well
that these are a
accomplishment a fulfillment of the lost tribes
they take that literally they think
potentially Paul believed
whether they were real literal Israelites or not
that Paul believed these were lost Israelites being saved
I like Staples thesis personally
because
Staples is saying by faith
they join Abraham's family
if you will and become descendants
if you will through Christ
of Abraham's seed
Galatians 3 but they do think
that the whole point is to save Israel
including the Gentiles
and I don't mean the muddy
the waters when I say
I was researching in 1914
or 17 there was a British
Israelite guy who mentioned
something that sounds similar
that Paul's going after Gentile
Israelites if you will
his whole point is to save them
how can we show that God fears
Israelites in a sense are not Israelites
that's a
it's a question that I personally like to study
but do you have any
I think it's got too many
moving parts really even to address it
because there's just too many words
that mean can mean multiple things
that are all being thrown out at the same time
right and so there's not
and it's not clear what the
it's not clear you know are you talking about what Paul
thought he was doing are you talking about what he said
his writings are you talking about when you say
salvation what do you mean
I mean you know for most of the Bible
salvation is not like going to heaven when you die
salvation's got nothing to do
with that salvation is
the armies are coming and are you going to
survive or not you know if you
survive you'll be saved
and so that's that's in the Old Testament
and and even Paul you know
I don't know if you know this but Paul
never uses the term
the verb saved as a past
event
and so if somebody were to ask Paul
have you been saved
Paul would say well no of course not
because salvation
salvation for Paul is what's going to
happen when Jesus returns from heaven
and everybody else gets wiped out
but some people will survive and enter
into the kingdom that's when salvation happens
and so when people
use terms like salvation you have to
you've got to figure out what you know when you're using that term
what do you mean by it because it may not be
appropriate to think you know Paul's
using the term that way
or Israelite
yeah so
most people think that
Israelites most people think
Israelites are people who are descended who are
part of ethnic Israel
and Paul certainly
did not think that those were the other ones who were going to be saved
his whole point was
that non-Israelites also can be saved
Gentiles can be saved
and where would you go to quote that for somebody
maybe where would you how would you make
an argument to someone if they are convinced that
because they see the Old Testament constantly
prophesies to coming back right
there's over and over they're going to come back
the Lost Tribes I've done a few interviews with
Drs. V. Benit and then of course Dr. Staples
on this
there is this idea that Paul's harping on
using Hosea in other places in
Romans 9 to 11 as though this is
fulfilling it but at the same time
when I read Romans 15
Paul's quoting about Gentiles
and it's no reference to lost Israelites
and he's talking about the nations getting the light
and stuff like that so do you think
Staples is onto something by saying
Paul might be utilizing
this prophecy stuff
applying them to his non-Israelite
non-ethnic
ethnic Israelites
Gentiles if you will
I think Paul did believe
that the Israelites will come back in
he did think that all Israel would be saved
he did but he didn't think that was the whole story
he was
equally influenced by 2nd
Isaiah which talks
about a light to the Gentiles
and that God
was using the rejection of the Jews
as a way of bringing in non-Jews
so there is going to be a
collection of Israel but
it's more than that it's the entire world
and so Paul's a universalist
he believes that both Gentile and Jew will come in
and as to what to read
Romans chapters 1 to 3
quite explicit on the point
and so is Galatians
chapters
especially chapters 1 through 3
or 1 through 4 in Galatians
and so Paul
absolutely doesn't think it's just about
those who are parts of
Israel the whole point
Paul in fact I mean it's even more
astounding than that when you think about Paul thought
because Paul looks at these passages
in the 2nd part of Isaiah
which says about
I've made you a light to the nations
you know that I've called you
to preach to the nations
Paul thinks that he himself is the fulfillment
of these prophecies
he thinks that God was talking about him
when he gave his prophecy to Isaiah
so Paul is the fulfillment
of God's promises it's like it's an
astounding idea
but it's precisely because
now salvation is not
just for Jews it's for Jews and Gentiles
and it's not based on
the old covenant it's based on Christ
whether you're Jew or Gentile
interesting there's so much
to unravel here I asked you
at the end of the last episode about Dr.
Staples work and he's only
written his book on you know going
from the Hebrew Bible the Old Testament
and 2nd Temple literature and various
things like Tobit interesting
book Jubilees
Maccabees these various texts that are
talking about
distinctions between Eudaios
or Jew and Israel
and Hebrew from Josephus
my question would be
and to probe now that I know
his work a little more how much
do you line up with what he's saying
and I'm not trying to pitch you guys
against each other because I know that he was your student
and he's a brilliant absolutely
brilliant guy
but scholars disagree all the time and that's totally okay
what do you disagree
about his thesis personally if you don't
mind me asking well so he
his book is part of his dissertation
so I directed his dissertation
and so I it wasn't just that
I was kind of a teacher I mean I was
I was directed his work
so
and the book that's coming out
is part of the dissertation
the dissertation is very long I forget
what it was 600 pages or something it's like
massively it was like oh my god
don't do that to an advisor please
but
it's a very it's a very
detailed and compelling work in its
way and his idea was
that Paul says that all Israel will be
saved what does he mean by Israel
you would think somebody might have asked that question
before
but people had asked him but they hadn't done it the way he did
which is looked at every reference to Israel
in every ancient Israelite
Jewish Christian
source is like ever
and see what do they mean
by it and so I
I think that his thesis
on
that Israel means the 12 tribes
that it's not
talking about Jews per se
it's talking about the 12 tribes
I am
I think that that looks to me like it's probably
right I mean I'm not completely
committed to it I'll be interested
in seeing how the book gets reviewed
by other experts
but
it's a thorough job it is a thorough job
and so that will be interesting
his next book will be taking it
then to the question of what Paul means
about all Israel will be saved
and he's somewhat
he's either changed his view about that
sometimes over the past or I
understood him differently in the past
it's one of those two things and so I'll wait
to see what he ends up arguing
in that book before I make a judgment on but he's
I think he's written that book I think it's done
it just isn't I don't know if it's been
except for publication or if it's in line yet
or not but the first one is coming out
pretty soon I think
it's out on paperback
yeah it's out on
oh it's on e-book
is it out in hardback already
um no
it's coming out in like a week or two
yeah that's right
yes sir I'm really really fascinated with it
so the last question I have is
James is writing to the 12 tribes
scattered abroad scholarship says
well the Jews constitute
Israel this goes right into the
staples vein of argument
the reason I'm going to pose this
is this way
Clement for example writes in one
Clement 29 he says
God has made us an elect portion
Clement's not an Israelite
Clement's not a Jew
Clement's a Christian
he's not even a Jewish Christian he's just a Christian
who's writing to the church in Corinth
and he's saying God has made us an elect portion
most scholars date it anywhere from 70 to
96 AD approximately
to me these non-Israelites
are now
using the ethnic tendencies of the
words like elect and chosen
to themselves like Ephesians might be
doing um
that can confuse someone who's been reading a
Hebrew Bible and then comes over to the New Testament
and goes are these guys Israelites
so this is why the whole vein of the conversation
to you has been brought up do you think
James is writing to only Jews
in the diaspora or do you think he's
writing to a new constitution of what's called
Israel the 12 tribes
of Jesus if you will
what do you think's happening there
so I definitely
would not use first climate as a way
of interpreting James but it's interesting that
it is evidence of how people are using the term
Israelite
and I don't think James knew it
or anything and first climate
cap date is early 70 it's got to be
in the 90s I think
so in any event
James is clearly not
writing to Jews I mean
he's writing to Christians
and he's
writing to followers of Jesus
and so
he's using the 12 tribes
as you're saying as an indication
of he's writing to the promised
to the people who are chosen, the chosen people
and he's taking over the language
that was used by ancient Israel to apply
now to the followers of Jesus
I don't think this author himself is James
I don't think it was James the brother
of Jesus at all
and I don't know
I somewhat doubt whether he himself is Jewish
but he has been influenced by
you know
and who knows when he's writing
there's very few ways to date the book of James
it's very very hard
except to say that in my opinion
it looks like when he says
that a person is saved by
works not by faith alone
and he uses Abraham as the example
and he quotes Genesis 316
it's quite clicked
whatever it is
Genesis 17
or something
whatever it is
it's quite clear that he
is writing after Paul
but I don't think he's responding
to Paul, I don't think he's rejecting Paul
he looks to me like
he's rejecting
a kind of reading of Paul
that you find in a book like Ephesians
I map all this
out of my book forgery
and it's a kind of long argument
but the point is that would mean
we're written after Ephesians
and so it's probably
at the end of the 1st century at best
early 2nd century
by that time
Christian communities are identifying themselves
as the chosen ones
and so they're happy to use Old Testament language
about being the 12 tribes now
and that's the same with 1 Peter
where he's talking about the elect
he's writing to the elect
yeah
he's clearly writing to Christians
he's not writing to Jews at all
wow
