Jochen Medakai gets there, he meets someone, we'll find out in a second, he says greetings to you,
the king, greetings to you the king, and it's Vespasian. Vespasian says to him, well you're liable
for two death penalties, one I'm not a king and you've called me a king so that's like treasonous
to the king, death to you, and also if I am the king why didn't you come to me until now,
like you waited this long to come to me, if I'm a king why didn't you come to me, well there's
among us and they you know it's all the zealots fault basically, you know we don't be going on
fine if it wasn't for the zealots, understanding that Raban Jochen Medakai was prepared to ask him
not to destroy the temple, Vespasian said okay if there's a barrel of honey and a snake and you've
got um is wrapped around it wouldn't they break the barrel in order to kill the snake in a similar
fashion, I have to destroy Jerusalem right in order to kill the zealots, we all know it's the
zealots, it's all about the zealots but we I'm sorry we have to kill Jerusalem because otherwise
we can't get at them and Rabbi Jochen Medakai was silent, he didn't have an answer
we are myth vision welcome back to myth vision podcast ladies and gentlemen
we need to take a look at the Jewish world, maybe you have a little more understanding
when it comes to things like the Jerusalem Talmud or the Babylonian Talmud or the Tesefta
or you name it all these writings why they matter especially when I love diving into the
New Testament understanding Christian history and what's up with early Christianity what really
happened and all of that there's a lot we should check out from the Jews themselves and so with
that being said I brought on my good friend Dan Jacobs how are you I'm really good thanks Derek
how are you doing good I'm really glad that you're here joining us to teach me a little bit of
what's going on with this literature what's it about whatever we're going to dive into
real quick plug if I may I have a patreon and he is one of the patreon members in fact this is
how we connected and also you know I I launched this stuff early this video itself will be found
on patreon early access for everybody who helps support me here so consider helping us out so
you can bring more education to the world and I can keep doing what I do here at myth vision
the website we're going to be talking about specifically is the safariya.org which is a
really good one and so Dan I'm ready when you are but if you would before we dive in I think
it's necessary that people know who is this guy I know who is Dan Jacobs so I'm I'm in London
based in the UK I'm a I grew up as a traditional Jew in an Orthodox family for many years I was
very Orthodox Jew and now I'm what we call off the derech which means no longer religious
and I'm I identify as an agnostic atheist during my time as a religious Jew learning and studying
is considered very very important so I became you know I was sort of brought up where they went
through Jewish education very familiar with Jewish texts and I became really interested from an
academic perspective and you know and who really wrote this stuff and where this will come from
so I you know self-taught but also studied at a local academic Jewish academic center here called
the London School of Jewish Studies where I did I think two or three year courses there it's a
quite in-depth study into the Talmud the rabbis and different things I know that Christine Hayes
had a debate with the rabbi over the Talmud and he was like you're not reading it for what the
purpose is really about it's it's to learn about how to apply and you know wisdom of God and things
like this and she's like no you know she said I'm not religious like you but she said I read it and
I get kind of a religious experience if I hope I'm not putting words in her mouth but it's
something like this she said I get a religious experience in the literature of learning who
the rabbi was what was he writing and why what did how were they thinking like all of those
interesting details that really a religious Jew is not reading this material for that purpose
no absolutely when um when we're learning these texts in a Yushiva a seminary or in a school system
or whatever um you're you're not looking at it from a kind of the context I mean some people are
but on the whole you're not looking at it from you know the context who wrote it why what was their
motivation all of that kind of things that's really interesting and I think it's important to say that
the academic study of the rabbinic texts is nowhere near as advanced as say the academic study of
Christian texts or or Old Testament slash Hebrew Bible obviously because of um you know numbers
essentially you know there's just a lot more people in the Christian world um and the secular
worlds were interested in that academic pursuit so a lot of what I'm talking about is how a religious
Jew understands these texts but um also the the degree to which I'm able to assess it through an
academic lens through and there are books and teachers available hopefully we can bring on to
myth vision in the future um so why don't um I start with um the really really basic I actually
have four sources on this website you talked about Sefiria which is a brilliant it's basically
you can pop it up now it's basically a website that has um hundreds and thousands of Jewish texts
on there and it's really well organized and you can put together your own source sheets which I've
done for today um you won't be getting too obvious today no no we won't be getting it's a lot in that
so I put together four sources that I want to cover even if we don't read them all uh and go into
detail um because what I'm showing here is um how the rabbis essentially adapted Judaism from a
uh temple cult or a temple religion to a diaspora religion or a religion without a central place
of worship um because you know historically Judaism was very much what what does Judaism mean
what's a Jew I mean it's it's someone from Judah right so Judaism was the the religion of the
land of Judah and Jews are the people from Judah um and without what do you do without that land
what do you do without the the temple and the the ritual sacrifice and uh so the rabbis had to really
after 70 had to really quickly uh pivot and and they were just amazingly creative and they
blow my mind you know I absolutely love this stuff um and just so everybody can get a forecast
taste of what you're going to point out and I think this is important in our New Testament studies is
when rabbis do and you gotta love them I mean rabbis are funnier than every
all the people on earth usually rabbis just know how to pull a joke out they're really
rabbi Tobi a singer for example but they love lambasting Christianity and jabbing at Paul like
you stupid but then when you really look at them as you're kind of trying to hit here they know how
to flex and bend and reinterpret and do the most amazing things with words
well I think I'm going to show you some radical things today that are absolutely central to
the rabbinic Judaism but when you look at them they're actually quite radical and yeah I think
you're 100 right that that's um it people religions other religions who criticize Christianity
especially Paul look how Paul distorted the Torah you know um and it's true but then that's how we
work that's what he was doing just what the rabbis do you know um the the difference is
that the rabbis claimed to have been given the authority to do that they've they claimed to
have been given the authority to take and twist and play with these things and that's what we're
going to look at now so I just want to start with the first text um and this is from the Mishnah
so the Mishnah is um uh written down in its final form around 220 CE and it's the central kind of
pillar of rabbinic Judaism um the way we understand it is that there were several Mishnahs um different
books and they were kind of like the cliff notes that the rabbis had when they were teaching
so um before so this was written down by Judah the prince Yehuda Hanasi in 220 and it's understood
that people before him like Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Rabbi Mir and other rabbis of the preceding age
also had their own Mishnahs but this is kind of putting it all together into one
um and a lot of the Mishnahs put into some kind of six categories six orders um and then there's
several books in them one of the books is very different to the others and that's the book we're
looking at today which is called Pirke al-Vot. Pirke al-Vot literally means paragraphs or of
the fathers or sayings of the fathers often it's translated as ethics of our fathers and it's kind
of all um uh it's mainly sayings ethical sayings and things like that but what they do at the
beginning is um really important for the whole of rabbinic Judaism so um and it says Moshakibil
Torah misinai so Moses received the Torah Sinai I'll just carry on in the English because it's
quicker and transmitted it to Joshua so we know who Joshua was and Joshua to the elders and Joshua
transmitted the Torah to the elders the elders are the scribes and sages and etc um and and the
prophets oh sorry the elders then to the prophets and then the prophets so the prophets we know the
prophets they're talking about you know Ezekiel and Isaiah and all these people ending with
Malachi which is the last book of of the Torah of the Tanakh um or Daniel which is the the last
written um piece according to academics um and then the prophets to the men of the great
assembly so this is the train chain of transmission so who were the men of the great assembly this is
in uh Nehemiah Nehemiah is that he said in English Nehemiah Nehemiah Nehemiah Nehemiah yeah so Nehemiah
in Hebrew um and it's so Ezra sets up this kind of court of 120 people made up of prophets
and sages and scribes and they're they're kind of deciding the law and it's around for say 100 or
200 years we don't know exactly in fact some we're not even sure it really existed um we don't have
fantastic evidence it's all just based on that the sources in in Nehemiah and then it gives here
just going back to text it gives a pithy kind of line what did they say the men of the great assembly
said three things be patient in giving justice raise many disciples so you need to train people
in in being in uh being judges and make a fence around the Torah so this is a very a big principle
of rabbinic Judaism that means you have to protect the the law so on Shabbat uh we don't um
cook food on Shabbat so we have to be careful we wouldn't even eat I don't know I'm just that's not
a good example but it's kind of taking it's it's kind of putting extra laws in place to protect
the fundamental laws I'll try to think of a better example yeah we see this with like maybe even
cleansing like washing of hands and things like to make sure one doesn't become unclean
you go the extra mile and wash 18 times let's say like some of the uh rabbis may have in the
first century you see a lot of washing uh taking place well I'll give you I'll give you a I'll give
you a contemporary example okay on Shabbat you're not allowed there's a a rabbinic law called or
concept called muxa which is an object you're not allowed to even touch on Shabbat and the reason
you're not allowed to touch it is because you may come to use it and it's something you're not
allowed to use on Shabbat so let's say my mobile phone if I was a religious Jew I shouldn't use my
mobile phone on Shabbat we can that's a whole other hour two hours conversation why um but it
does always lead back to the Torah um and so you shouldn't even touch it you shouldn't even move it
in case you come to use it and that's putting a fence around the Torah or at least a modern
understanding of that so we're just going to keep going through the text so you've got the men of
the great assembly um and then you've got now it starts listing um individual people and then
pairs and they're more individual people and giving you their sayings so we're going to just go
through so we're not going to go read them all but uh Shimon had studied so uh Shimon or Simon
the righteous was one of the last of the great assembly here's what he said etc and now the
next one um verse one three Antigonus from Socho um a place um he got the the tradition uh from
Simon the righteous and he used to say XYZ there's some amazing sayings in here some of them are
brilliant um and now if you go to the next one you start seeing Yossi Ben Yueze and Yossi Ben
Yohanan um they uh of Jerusalem and they used to say and it keeps doing this so we're not going to
go through the whole text it keeps doing it now I want to flip over um Derek to the timeline that I
gave you okay let me grab that real quick because we can see on the timeline what it's actually doing
is um it's uh the timeline is not on that document it's a google uh spreadsheet that I also sent you
a link to so you may have to okay hold on one second let me get that up so why don't you send
that to me you already emailed it to me or you did I sent it as a link on whatsapp um but I'll
send it to you okay I found it okay so while you're bringing that up there's a really important
question here what do they mean by Torah what do they mean by tradition when they're passing this
stuff down what does it mean yeah this is what I want to show so what does it mean it actually um
the truest tradition is that when Moses was on Mount Sinai he received the Torah but the Torah is
not just the Pentateuch or the Tanakh um it's also the the entire oral Torah and everything
that's ever going to come from the oral Torah and the oral Torah is what the Mishnah is um and the
Mishnah is you know written down in 220 and when you read the Mishnah it's kind of like
some of its conversations some of its stories a lot of it's very contemporary of its time and
it's like how could Moses have received that it's kind of about people that are living 1500 years
after him um but that's the belief is that um so I've kind of put this timeline together it's um
if you look at the dating um to keep it simple I put sort of end dates so you've got Moses um
first there and then you've got him giving the the tradition to uh Joshua and then the elders get
it so they're judges and kings the prophets and then you've got this great assembly which was founded
by Ezra um Shimon had Sadiq Simon the just um who is or the righteous who and you can see the dates
we're starting to get into a kind of more sort of uh almost at the christian era and um then you've
got what we call the Zogot which are pairs now the Zogot um where the sort of really recognize
as the first these are Pharisees right um and and there some of them are mentioned like you've
got at the end Hillel and Shamai these are mentioned and some of the others are mentioned in like
Josephus and in other places um so we know that that they are probably historical figures at least
some of them were the pairs there were two roles to the pairs you have what the first one is the
Nassi which is the prince and the Nassi was led the um great assembly um or sorry uh would have led
the uh the follow-up to the great assembly which is the Sunhedrin so we we know about the Sunhedrin
from Acts because Paul gets dragged there and gets in trouble and then he gets defended um by the
Pharisees right so the the Nassi the prince is in charge of the Sunhedrin and there's a second
role of Beit Din which is the father of the or the head of the rabbinic court and they are the
assistant to the Nassi so that's what that's what these pairs are so interestingly when you go down
and um you can see this is going through kind of the Maccabean periods or the Hasmonean period
into the Roman period when you go down to Hillel Hillel and Shamai they're two really famous um
Zugot and kind of seen as really sort of maybe the first rabbis but there's no real line um and um
actually um interestingly if you scroll across a little bit the first um so the first pair the
instead of Hillel and Shamai it was actually Hillel and Monachim the Asin so Monachim the Asin
was the um the assistant to Hillel um and so it's really interesting that there was um it's recorded
that there was an Asin who was in the the Sunhedrin and he was you know part of this whole process
and just I'm just uh bringing that out here so you can see how it all starts to tie together
in the worlds we live in then you get and we'll come back to the texts in a minute you get the
Tanna Iyem and these are the um what we consider to be the rabbis of the Mishniic periods of the
period of the Mishnah so they start with sort of Hillel and Shamai who are a kind of crossover
and it ends with Judah the Prince who's the guy that writes down the Mishnah
and some of these names you'll you'll be familiar or at least one of them you're familiar with
because you've got um uh you've got um Gamliel in there right right so Gamliel Hazaken the elder
or the old um so he he was maybe Paul's teacher if we believe that that's true don't know um
and so he was part of this tradition and what what's really cool is that from the time of Hillel
all the way until the 9th century this role of the Nasi the Prince was hereditary
so all of these people underneath like Shimon Bar Hillel and then Gamliel and then Shimon
Ben Gamliel and all of these people uh or the or the head at least the the the Nasi in each period
was a descendant like a blood son of the previous so it's really long dynasty here it's like probably
one of the longest in the world although they didn't have like political power they were in
charge of they had a lot of power um so um yeah so so then I think without continuing to go through
everything let's go back to the text um otherwise we're not gonna have time I know I'm throwing lots
of information uh everyone today so hopefully we can dive deeper into some of it another time
um so if we scroll down um just if we keep going down to the end of the Piracaya Bot section
hopefully it's kind of delineated um and if you I'm sure you'll share the link in the description
but it's oh yeah like reading some of this stuff is is really cool there's like some really interesting
stories um associated with each of them um so yeah is there a yeah is there an intro yes there is
so there's a bit of intro I've written so go up a little bit um this one up here is uh oh yeah so
that's the previous one okay yeah so this is so what we're doing is um I think this one is yeah I
think this one is from the Babylonian Talmud so there's two Talmuds um which you you've mentioned
a few times on the channel um so you've got the Mishnah which is redacted in 220 about 200 years
over the next sort of 150 years the rabbis continue to sort of um adapt or sort of comment
commentate on the Mishnah and it becomes so they literally like writing a commentary on the Mishnah
and that is um we call it Gamara and that makes up the two together make up the Talmud
and that's the the uh Palestinian or Jerusalem Talmud they're interchangeable names but the Jews
would not have been living in Jerusalem so um there's obviously trying to attach it to the
importance of Jerusalem so that's some headroom in the center of um Judaism moves from Jerusalem
because of the destruction of the temple and then obviously with the Bar Kokhba revolt
and it first of all it ends up in um a place called Yavna which is sort of the south of Israel
and then it moves to the Galilee where where the sun headroom is until it ends in the fourth century
and no longer exists and this story which I'm going to go through from the um or at least some of it
from the the Talmud in Gittin which is a book of the Talmud shows um how um they they they
managed to get out of Jerusalem and and basically set up the rabbinic academies so this um this is
from the Babylonian Talmud which is then picked up uh picked up in sort of modern day Iraq there
are Jewish academies there the in the fifth sort of fourth fifth and sixth century that's where the
center of rabbinic thinking is it's moved away from the land of Israel because um that the the
Jews there really uh don't have any power and there's no um they've had so many have had to leave
and it's not a welcome in place anymore um and that's where the the the new Babylonian Talmud which
is kind of the most important Talmud for Jews today is put together over a period of several hundred
years so I'm just going to read um some of this let me put it on my screen so I'm not squinting
do you have any questions while I'm pulling this up no I think this is really interesting I mean
one of them I do is how reliable is uh a lot of material you know it's it's one of those things
because I would love to say some of this is reliable but to glean historical nuggets you know
it's like how reliable are the Gospels it's the same kind of question it's really hard to get
into um you know again like when they're writing stories they're they're and um yeah we should give
a bit of background so this is a midrush in the Talmud we talk about midrush it comes up the word
comes up on this vision a lot midrush is comes from the word drush which is basically a story
and they're they are not supposed to be historical truth or little truth in the way we you know
modern people understand it they are stories which may have kernels of truth but they are to teach
us something um and the Talmud especially the Babylonian Talmud but the Mishnah and both Talmud
have midrush in there there's two types of midrush there's midrush halacha and midrush agadah
midrush halacha are stories that are supposed to help you understand the the law
and often relate back to the Torah and there are lots of as well as being in the Mishnah and Talmud
there are there's lots of books of midrush halacha like Sifra and Sifre which are midrushic exegesis of
the of the i think it's exodus and Leviticus um off the top of my head um and then um there's
midrush agadah which are kind of more moralistic stories that give that are not supposed necessarily
necessarily either attached to the Torah or learning the law but are about learning um
principles or ethics and that kind of thing so we're looking here this is an agadic story
so not a legal story um and it says the the the Gamara relates so the Gamara is the commentary
on the Mishnah and the Talmud um Abba Sikra was the leader of the zealots of Jerusalem so we know
the zealots of Jerusalem were these um this group in Jerusalem that were went around um wanting
to agitate for a fight right and the rabbis do not like them they talk negatively about them in
the Talmud so they don't like them they're seen as kind of white you know the reason why Jerusalem
was destroyed if we hadn't bothered the Romans so much you know we could have just placated them a
bit more maybe um so that so he's the uh leader of the zealots and and and he's the son of the sister
of Yohannem ben Zakkai who's on our timeline we saw earlier Yohannem ben Zakkai is um the
one of the rabbinic leaders of the time Rabban Yohannem ben Zakkai Rabban uh being an Aramaic
sort of version of Rabbi um uh there's so much to say that this is all written in Aramaic the
Mishnah's Hebrew and the the Talmud is Aramaic um and so the the Rabbi sends a message come to me
being secret he came Rabban Yohannem said to him until um when are you gonna like when are you
gonna be enough with this when's enough you're gonna kill us all through starvation so they're
in the siege in Jerusalem and Yohannem ben Zakkai is challenging this the the leader of the zealots
you know what are you doing you're crazy we're gonna die you're gonna die of starvation
and he said what can i do um for if i try and stop it they're gonna kill me i'm not the bad one
it's the other zealots there you know blame them Yohannem ben Zakkai said so let me leave this
give me a way of leaving the city so at least there's some salvation interesting interesting
word salvation um so we carry on um so the the zealots uh leader said to him okay pretend you're
ill and everyone ask or how you're doing and the word will spread to everyone and know that you're
really ill and afterwards bring something that's really stinks and put it near you so people think
you died and that you're decomposing and then have your students um come to take you to a burial
and no one else um will in the zealots they won't know um there's this whole thing about the body
being lied but let's not go into that they thought the body got lighter when you died um probably
like the soul is quite heavy or something i don't know um and oh there you go as the zealots know
that living person is lighter than the dead person um good science um so we're carrying on uh get in
56 a 17 so he did it right and Rabbi Eliezer very important um student who who's uh very big in the
Mishnah and Rabbi Shura another similar one they took him either side they went to the entrance to
the city of Jerusalem and they went past the guards um the zealot guards and they wanted to
pierce his body to make sure he's actually dead apparently it was a common practice and um the
leader of the zealots uh Abba Sikara said to them by the way Sikara um is Sikari Sikaran yeah Sikari
now it's probably obviously not a real name the Sikari were those um uh who like had these sharp
knives that they would stab people with right and um so that's uh that's a very sort of rabbinic
thing they're kind of like there is this idea that uh Judas Iskariot is a garbled term Sikari
yeah um would have been probably a bit earlier i don't know because for me the Sikari were around
the um the Jewish wars which made me was like in the 60s um but you know it could have been
an earlier idea i don't know well i mean in the Gospels i i definitely in most the critical
scholars i talked to think that they're written post war so oh that's already known this idea
it's just an anachronism yeah right yeah um yeah so um and the Romans will say oh they pierce even
their teacher and and uh the guards want to do push him to see if he's still alive and he'll cry out
and the Abba Sikara said to them and and they're gonna you know anyway there's a lot of repetition
anyway um but he said oh they're gonna push you in other words he's saying the Romans will say you
don't respect the your teacher the rabbi if you're gonna stab him and you're gonna push him so don't
do that so um you know it's uh said managers to get out opens the gate and he's taken out
Jochen Medakai gets there and um he meets someone we'll find out in a second he says
greetings to you the king greetings to you the king and it's Vespasian Vespasian says to him
well you're liable for two differentities one i'm not a king and you've called me a king so that's like
treasonous to the king death to you and also if i am the king why didn't you come to me until now
like you waited this long to come to me and he says um um he says uh in truth you are a king
i'm just skipping down to be one um if you're not a king Jerusalem would not be handed over to you
in other words you're not going to get Jerusalem because it's written and the Lebanon shall fall
by mighty one and mighty one so this is doing this is from Isaiah and he's doing some exegesis on this
and mighty one only means a king as it is written from a completely different source unrelated
good rabbinical work here and their mighty one shall be of themselves so for that for me that means
you're a you're going to be a king and Lebanon means the temple as it is stated somewhere
completely different and not connected um that good mountain and the Lebanon so the good mountain
and the Lebanon is a little completely out of context but this is what rabbis do so we maybe
we shouldn't be so critical to Paul right um and so he's basically using these proof like these uh
these quotes as texts to say i'm prophesizing based on these texts you have to be a king you
have to be um and um as for your second comment um if i'm a king why didn't you come to me well
there's zealots among us and they you know it's all the zealots fault basically you know we don't
be going on fine if it wasn't for the zealots there's a lot of anti zealot um in lots of places in
the Talmud so moving on 56 b2 um so um and this is i should say when we're looking at this text the
bit that's not bolded is is kind of interpolation by the by the person translating it so it's to
try and make it easier to read because the Talmud is not easy to read so um understanding that
Raban Yohannem Ben-Zakai was prepared to ask him not to destroy the temple so this is all assumed
but it's actually in the text it is in the text but it's he's sort of rewriting it to make it easier
Vespasian said okay if there's a barrel of honey and a snake and you've got um is wrapped around it
wouldn't they break the barrel in order to kill the snake in a similar fashion i have to destroy
Jerusalem right in order to kill the zealots we all know it's the zealots it's all about the zealots
but we i'm sorry we have to kill Jerusalem because otherwise we can't get at them
and Rabbi Yohannem Ben-Zakai was silent he he didn't have an answer um and then he gets castigated
there's a little bit here something he's he's kind of uh gets called foolish man by a later Rabbi
um but let's skip that bit um because he kind of basically is allowing Jerusalem to be destroyed
as assuming beyond as Rabbi Yohannem Ben-Zakai should have said
to Vespasian in response in such a case we'll just use tongs you can use precision weaponry
to remove the the zealots you know we'll just use a laser-guided bomb
and to take it that way you didn't have to destroy the barrel the Jerusalem as well
um there's a lot of like metaphor and imagery used in the Talmud
um so just the next one three is 56b3 in the meantime as they're talking a messenger
by the way in when it's got in brackets it's got for a tisca that's what they're doing is showing
word play but i'm not going to go into that there's a lot of word play and rhyme and stuff and
dual meanings but obviously it's you can you can study this text for a year you know
in the meantime messenger comes from Rome and said to him rise for the emperor has died and
the noblemen of Rome plan to appoint you as their leader and make you the next emperor
and at that time Vespasian was wearing only one shoe when he tried to put on the other one it
wouldn't go on his foot i think your feet grow when you become king or something um
um so he said um so we're just moving on to four Rabbi Yohanan as I said be not distressed for
good tidings have reached you as it is written good tidings make the bone fat and your feet
have grown fatter out of joy and satisfaction but what's the remedy as Vespasian and Rabbi Yohanan
says well have someone who you're unhappy with uh passed before you because as it's written so
he's showing his mastery of the text here you know a broken spirit drives the bones
so he did this and then she went on his foot now people you know rabbis will spend decades
writing commentaries about what all that means you know uh why that's in there what that's got
to do with the story and what we need to learn from it um so Vespasian says since you're so wise
and you didn't come and see me um and you know you should have told me let's just sorry let's just
move on and five uh 56p five Vespasian said to Raban Yohanan Bezakai I will be going to Rome
to accept my new position and I'll send someone else in my place to continue besieging the city
and waging war against it but before I leave ask me anything and I'll give it to you and
Yohanan Bezakai said give me Yavna and its sages and do not destroy it and spare the
dynasty of Raban Gumbeliel so and do not kill them as if they're the rebels um so this is the
really critical bit he's not saying do me a favor just don't destroy the temple when you get in there
don't destroy the temple why not because this is all written afterwards anyway you can you know
the temple's destroyed well what he's saying is so give us this academy in Yovna that's what
they said up there and the sages the rabbis there give them like protection and there was we know
historically there was a a roman garrison in Yovna so it would have been a protective place
they all would have been told to be okay with these guys and um that's all I'm asking for
and then there's a bit about healing rabbis ad hoc we're not going to go into that um
and let's move on to anything else we should say and what so number six 56 b6 and why didn't
Raban Yohanan Bezakai make the request um which I think is to do with saving Jerusalem
he maintained that Vespasian wouldn't do that much for him there would not even be a small
amount of salvation so he'll just say no I'm not saving Jerusalem I'm not going to give you that
so it's not going to happen so therefore he just made a small request that's how they
are able to you know justify um this situation allowing Jerusalem to be destroyed
and then at the end it says you know Vespasian went back to Rome and sent Titus in his place so
we know there's some history here right you know this stuff happened um and the Gomorrah that's uh
this commentary cites a verse referring to Titus and he shall say where is their god their rock
in whom they trusted this is the wicked Titus who insulted and blasphemed god on I Titus destroys
the temple so that is um the midrush and uh I think it's just incredible it's like um if you
put it together with the mission that we looked at before you've got the beginnings the very beginnings
of how the rabbis started to get the head around understand and adapt to the temple being destroyed
we've got this chain of tradition this chain of tradition in the Mishnah the Mishnah is the
Oral Torah the Oral Torah was given at Mount Sinai with Moses two Moses with the written Torah
so that lineage was always there it's always established it was always supposed to be
and so it's really important we save that lineage it's really important that the rabbis gets
to be given Yavla and to be allowed to have their academy there and continue running as some
hedron there the courts the high court supreme court right because because that is Torah
and we and without the temple the Torah is the most important thing
so this makes me want to ask so many questions of course and like
like critical historians or people who are really getting to the bottom of this when do they say the
I mean is this an origin myth to suppose that there was really this tradition
and yeah so yeah so the the the chain of transmission in the Mishnah we don't know
exactly when that came up but you know you can by reading it by looking at it you could have a
pretty good idea the rabbis obviously created it it may have been a tradition that the Pharisees
created because it starts with phariseic names you know like Hillel and people like that and
just the people of that generation that's where when you look at that mission in the
pyrrhicavot the ethics of the fathers that's where for example there are no sayings until
you come to the men of the great assembly right the men of the great and then there's one saying
attributed to them which we read and then as when you get into the Zagot these pairs of rabbis who
are more Pharisees if you could distinguish that's when they start getting lots of traditions
attributed to them so I think it's somewhere in the kind of first century BCE first century CE
period is when the that kind of tradition of authority is and this whole smuggling Yohan
and Menzakai out of Jerusalem and giving him Yavna that is definitely later I mean it's in
both Talmuds so the earliest it could be is the 300 so the 4th century sometime when they're in Yavna
and actually yeah right well they've moved but to the Galilee after they didn't stay in Yavna for that
long um probably because that part of Israel became very hostile with the Bacchal Revolta and things
but what's interesting we don't have time to do it today but you and I have talked about this before
is there's a similar story in Josephus where he talks about himself essentially meeting
he's hauled up hiding from the Romans with his garrison they all killed kill themselves
Josephus the last one of his garrison left standing he gets captured by Vespasian he
quotes some of the same sources that we see in this and the Vespasian basically says okay
you know you can come and live with me you're part of the Flavius family now
so there's there's a parallel there and definitely there's a similar quote and we
maybe look at the do a textual analysis of the two together so for me this is lifted
from there and turns into an origin story for the the sages of Yavna so I'm aware of the time
um and I know we're gonna keep this try and keep this to an hour today but I'd like to
briefly look at the next two sources because they're really cool um and the next one we've got um
is by a teacher of mine um uh he calls it the back to the future Gamara again the word Gamara it's
the that's the commentary on the Mishnah which and the Mishnah and Gamara together is the Talmud
so um this is another Agadita so a um a Medrushic story also in the Babylonian Talmud
and in this story um it's basically how Moses is confused because he doesn't understand
well let's just go through it because rather than explaining it and I've shortened it actually so
I've kind of pulled bits out and shortened it so um Rabbi Yehuda so this is um they're quoting
again this is Babylonian Talmud sort of fifth sixth seventh century because it was edited over
a long period of time it's hard to know exactly what was written then um but but they're calling
back to Rabbi Yehuda who is a Mishnahic Rabbi so going back to that Mishnah period of first,
second and early third century uh uh CE Rabbi Yehuda said in the uh Rav said so he's
quoting another but this happens a lot this person said that this person said that this person said
when Moses ascended to the heavens so this happened apparently he found the Holy One
Blessed Be sitting and attaching crowns to the letters so when you pick when you look at
Torah you'll see there's crowns on the letters we don't really know what they mean now
and he said before him he said to him master of the universe um he's not he-man it's just
one of the names for God um master of the universe who is uh staying your hand he said to him
so who's like um getting you to attach these crowns and he says there's a man one man who
exists in many generations in the future his name's Akiva the son of Joseph Yosef
who will in the future expound on every crown and crown piles and piles of laws
so what he's saying is Rabbi Akiva who's a very famous Mishnahic Rabbi really important
he had probably his own Mishnah which was then became part of the Mishnah we have now
here there's amazing many amazing stories about him he would derive laws from the crowns not just
the words in the Torah and the sentences but even the crowns um there were two rabbis uh he had
a kind of adversary Rabbi Yishmael um who was very much we kind of do what it says on the tin
we do what it says in the Torah we don't and Rabbi Akiva was no much more like no no no like
he was like weed into everything um so this is kind of like how could Rabbi Akiva do that you know
and um so he said uh so Moses says to God master of the universe show me this guy I want to see
him right so turn backwards this is the back to the future bit this is where Moses gets in a
DeLorean gets 88 miles per hour and then he finds himself at the back of Rabbi Akiva's classroom
his bait midrush his house of learning right so he went and sat at the end of the eighth road
that's like the back where the thickie sits this the the idiots right because the way it would work
is that what the clever ones would be at the front and the stupid ones at the back so it's
really showing Moses had no idea what was going on here and he didn't know what they were talking
about he had no idea he got upset and um as soon as Rabbi Akiva got to like one thing or another
thing his students said our teacher from where did you learn this so this is Rabbi Akiva's students
say where did you learn this he said it's the law that was taught to Moses at Sinai
right right interesting and here's Moses not knowing what yeah and the non-name was going on
but it's interesting because this is the idea that the entire oral Torah including whatever
Rabbi Akiva's learning from the crowns on the on the letters of the Torah was given at Sinai
so Moses calms down and he returned he got back in his delorean and he came back to God
and he said holy one blessed be he um master of the universe you have a man like this
and you're giving the Torah to me why would you give the Torah to me right i'm an idiot compared
to this guy um and he said to him shut up um this is what i've decided so God's like i need to tell you
like this is just how it works this is you know this is it and he said to him master of the
universe you show me his Torah show me his reward so um he goes back into his delorean and he ends up
in the roman times now that's unfortunately he's really nasty midrush about um several midrush
him um stories about how Rabbi Akiva was killed by the romans and they flailed here they burnt him
alive and in the end he's uh yeah he has he's tortured etc so Moses sees this he turns backwards
and he saw that they're tearing his skin with iron combs and Moses says to god master of the universe
and i'll tell you that what he says in aramaic or hebrids this is Torah and this is the reward
like this is a man of Torah like this amazing learning and he's learning all these things out
that you gave to me but i obviously passed on by somehow didn't understand that now he's teaching
it and this is what the law is and this is what you do to him and God's like shut up this is why
this is it there's a real kind of um uh what's the word that um uh used about Calvinism determinism
here like a determinism it's like this is just i'm not going to give you the reasons why this is
just it don't question me so anyway it's a brilliant story um that ties together with the
two previous things the sources that we've looked at because it's showing the extent to which the
rabbis are given authority and Rabbi Akiva is going i'm going to learn out what i'm going to learn
out from from this from the crowns on there and that's it and Moses looks at it and he's confused
and goes like that's it this is it i don't need to explain to you this is what this is the the score
yeah there's a couple of things that i'm picking up in this in my opinion i could be wrong uh seems
like they had a lot of time to look over these same things and to come up with clever ways of
like teaching something number one moses doesn't get it which might mean the way they're viewing
the text is it's alive kind of like what we see in the new testament when people love to pick at
Christianity and sure i do it too uh to point out they're re interpreting the text for Jesus oh
this is talking about him he's talking about him i imagine they would have done this for Rabbi Akiva
or whoever in the situation re interpreting the text to apply to a certain rabbi or to apply to
a certain teacher or a certain issue that's going on and its original context has nothing to do with
that issue so here is moses doesn't get it is blown away like everything you handed to me i only
got like this much of it everyone else is seeing the the the depths that this is not only that why
are you giving the Torah to me like why didn't you wait for Rabbi Akiva or you know like this guy's
the bomb you know he knows what he's talking about like he's he really gets it why you know
and and god could have said well you know you needed to be now and you were the person of your
generation and right um it had to be so that the Jews you know could reach the land of Israel
or the Israelites couldn't reach the land of Israel and yeah it couldn't but it's like no
just right shut up like literally shut up it also makes me think of the the kind of torture
that he went through um this might get into some type of uh theology in a suffering servant type
mentality that i wonder there's a whole there's a whole thing we can do and another time of
suffering rabbis so there's this kind of idea in Judaism oh we don't have the suffering so we
don't have this guy who suffers um like suffering is not good it's not seeing as a good thing and
then there are these people that do suffer like Rabbi Akiva but there's a brilliant one called
guy in the missionary period called Nakham of Gamzoo Nathan uh no that was is it Nakham
or Natan anyway of Gamzoo so the place he's from is called Gamzoo but it's also a pub
because um he it's a bit he's a bit of like a rabbinic job right he says um may if if um
he challenges gods to kind of like remove his limbs and all sorts of things and
he's like going through all this suffering and every time like um it happens to him he's like
Gamzoo Latova which means that's all for the best it's what God wants it's fine and it's a very kind
of jabion and and he's not the only character so there is a kind of idea of of suffering being
a positive thing but it's not the mainstream rabbinic ideology it's kind of a minor a minor
thread that goes through this and it's not really what we're looking for suffering but it does exist
I was wondering just looking at that passage at the end where you talk about Master of the
Universe such Torah and such reward he said to him be silent this is what I was excited about
yeah I didn't know and I was thinking of like like this guy's Torah like like like Moses is
saying to God like like what's like this is a great Torah this Torah beyond what he knows of
such a reward and what I was thinking was is like when you're such when you're that learned and you
have that much wisdom in this is this the kind of reward you get like is it uh wise people will
suffer I didn't know if that's you could read it that way but I don't think that's what's intended
I think it's a different message here um which is basically we can have this relationship you and I
but I'm gold yeah but you're asking me these questions but don't forget I'm gold so I don't
actually have to answer anything this is like Paul in Romans chapter 9 when they ask him you know
how can God find any fault with everybody since he's the one causing it all and he's like who do
you think you are does the man say to its maker why have you made me thus he's like shut up
God does what he wants with the clay he makes some vessels for wrath some vessels for glory
get over it you know like he he he does what this rabbi you're describing is obviously trying to convey
so let's um just quickly do the last one because for me this is like the cherry this is like
explosion you know when you put mentals into a kopeke thing and it just explodes so um this is um
a halakhic um mid rush so it's a mid rush it's about Jewish law and there's a big argument here
again it's about it's also in the Babylonian Talmud but it's talking about Mishnik rabbis rabbis
of the mission of periods and there's a big argument between Rabbi Eliezer who was um the
leading rabbi at the time um there's a lot of interesting stories about him and uh what happens
to him um and basically him versus the rest of the rabbis are arguing over a point of law
so um it's and it's called the oven of Akhni because the point of Jewish law is whether
a particular oven is ritually can be ritually purified or not so as it says here apropos the
topic of uh verbal mystery love we learned in a Mishnah um going in Kalim which is vessels
if one cut on earth the way ovens sidewise into segments and place sand between each
every segment um Rabbi Eliezer says it's ritually pure by the way this is kind of a bit like how
you make a pizza oven so um so I've got a pizza oven in my garden and when I bought this house I
asked my friend who's a rabbi can I can I coach for it and he said it's the oven of Akhni so it
depends if you believe Rabbi Eliezer or the other rabbis so anyway because of this it's a legal
status that um is not that of a complete vessel and therefore it's not susceptible to ritual
impurity and the rabbis deem it ritually impure as it's functionally a complete oven so there's a big
what we call a machloket a disagreement between the rabbis and this is known as the oven of Akhni
the Gamara asks what's the relevance of Akhni a snake in this context Rabbi Yehuda said
that Shmuel said is characterised in the manner due to the fact the rabbis surrounded it
with their statements like the snake which often forms a coil when it rests it's deemed and is deemed
impure okay I'm not going to go into that because we don't have time the rabbi the sages who are the
rabbis taught so we call them these uh are um on these Mishnaik and further rabbis down the line
we call them sages or khazal which is an abbreviation of the sages of blessed memory
they thought on that day when they discussed this matter Rabbi Eliezer answered all the
possible answers in the world to support his opinion he gave every single reason he brought
all the proof texts to show why it was pure why it was allowed but the rabbis did not accept his
explanations after failing to convince the rabbis using halakha logic he said to him if the law
the halakha is in accordance with me this carob tree will prove it right carob trees crop up a lot in
the in the Talmud the carob tree was uprooted from its place a hundred cubits there's a measurement
cubits and some say 400 you know we're not sure which because it's definitely history
um the rabbi says to him listen he don't prove halakha the Jewish law from what what a carob tree
does right Rabbi Eliezer then says okay if the halakha is halakha is in accordance with my opinion
the stream will prove it and the water in the stream turned backwards and began flowing in
the opposite direction and they said to him listen we don't follow halakha by what a stream
does right it's not how it works so Rabbi Eliezer says to them okay if it's the halakha
is on my side then the walls of this study hall will prove it and the walls of the study hall
leaned inwards and began to fall Rabbi Yoshua scolded the walls and said to them if Torah scholars
are contending with each other in masses of halakha what's it going to do with you walls
the walls did not fall because of deference to Rabbi Yoshua so these are all kind of miracle
man right but they did not straighten because of difference and they remained uh and they still
remain leaning uh maybe to the state so Rabbi Eliezer said to them if the halakha is in accordance
with my opinion heaven will prove it and a but call a divine voice or uh a voice from heaven
emerged and said why are you arguing with Rabbi Eliezer as the halakha is in accordance with his
opinion in every place every time he says halakha it's his it's true i'm god i'm telling you i'm a
voice from heaven well it's not clear if it's god but it's a voice from heaven Rabbi Yoshua stood on
his feet and said it is written and this is like just hold on to your seats here it is not in heaven
this is a quote Deuteronomy 3012 go look it up context no context i can't remember the context
but i've looked at it in the past there's no reason to to understand it in this way what's
the relevance of this phrase it is not in heaven Rabbi Uremio says since the Torah was already
given at Mount Sinai we do not regard a divine voice uh as you've already written it you already
gave us the Torah right and it says in the Torah you after a majority to incline Exodus 232 right
you follow the majority that's that's how you make decisions and since the majority of rabbis
disagreed with Rabbi Eliezer's opinion the halakha the law is not ruled in accordance with his opinion
isn't that amazing
yeah i was well i'm he the Torah is not in heaven it's not it's not right this is the ultimate
triumph of the rabbis they are not only do they have the authority to continue to be the leaders
of Judaism they are the real authentic Judaism but they override a heavenly voice a divine voice
there there the majority view of the rabbis that's how you decide what what the law is not
if God gets involved it's so interesting because this does i think tie into Paul and not directly
not directly but this idea the reason why i mentioned this and this is they are not connected
it anyway i'm saying that it's a related issue because if you look at um if you look at the the
what is it the pseudoclementine literature you find this issue between Peter and Paul and Peter
is literally telling Paul your visions the voices the noises from heaven like they're probably demonic
or evil like you can't trust them you can't believe them and is making an excuse for everything Paul's
claiming is true and i just read Deuteronomy 30 verse 12 that you you had up yeah and just ripping
it out of context it says it is not in heaven that you should say who will listen to heaven for us
and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it yeah well i mean you could argue that you can see
why there's an argument to be made that that's relevant but but maybe not but um i think it's
different to the situation with Peter and Paul because um Peter's saying you're a mad man and
you're just either making this stuff stuff up stuff up or you're or you have devils in you
right these rabbis are saying we heard god's voice we heard you we we that's not how it works we
don't listen to gods when it comes to this he's given it to us to do and just to read in the next
bit the gemara relates years after rabbi nutton encountered Elijah the prophet Elijah the prophet
turns up the whole time and they're like very frequently some brilliant stories with him so um
and says to him what did the holy one blessed be he do at that time when rabbi yoshua issued
this declaration and Elijah the prophet says to him the holy one blessed be he smiled and said
my children have triumphed over me my children have triumphed over me so god is kind of like
pleased about it he's like these guys i gave him this stuff they know what they're doing they're
running with a you know well done kids this is a very interesting point like god's testing them in a
way like like you know you could take it as like no matter what even if god himself tries to change
things they are being consistent with not changing it and while that's funny and cool but in reality
that's kind of a scary thing unless you're going to reinterpret what a lot of things mean
in modern context because if as you well know there's a lot of very outdated ideas slavery you
name it in the Torah that we obviously don't practice yeah and i maybe this is a good point
to finish on and i've seen this currently on the myth vision facebook group there's like a
discussion going on and where someone is kind of arguing from a jewish traditional perspective
someone's arguing from a historical perspective from a jewish perspective it almost doesn't matter
what it says the the plain reading of the Torah almost doesn't matter you're not supposed to read
it like that we are taught that's not how you first of all you you have to read Torah with a commentary
usually at rushy or something like that is medieval commentator and you need to understand it through
the lens of the rabbis because it was all given together right we're giving you the plain text
and we're giving you the oral tradition you can't understand the plain text without the
oral tradition that's why and the the Sadducees rejected the oral tradition that's why they got
it wrong according to the rabbis and contemporary Judaism like pretty much all forms of even
reform Judaism is rabbinical you know like all forms of there's a very very small carotide
Jewish community left in the world who were kind of like eighth century onwards Sadducees but sort
of picked up some of their ideas but but mostly this is how Jews understand the Torah right so
this idea of like well an eye for an eye that's never meant an eye for an eye it never
mean literally an eye for an eye it's just it's about monetary compensation you know if you
break my property you have to pay me for it that's what it means like yeah you didn't you didn't see
the oral law well don't don't be silly so this is one one of the reasons why Jews and Christians
are reading completely different texts when we look at the Hebrew Bible or the or the Old Testament
because we've got you know we we we are looking at through the the lens of the rabbis and the
the rabbinic Jewish belief is that this is the tradition that goes all the way back to Moses
received from God and then passed down and they don't get it the the Christians don't get it the
Karaites don't get it the Sadducees don't get it the Essenes don't get it although they seem to have
got it some to some degree um the Samaritans don't get it none of these groups get it the you know
none of the modern christian groups get it Muslims who are reading the Torah don't get it
um even though there's a lot of Talmud and Midrash in the Quran but that's a whole other
conversation um this is how we this is it's it's all the same thing you can't say you can't
differentiate between the five books of Moses or the Tanakh and the oral law
right right yes technically the the Torah has an it is like the most important source and it's
the overriding authority but if you're not understanding it through the rabbinic lens
you're not understanding it yeah this is it's an interesting whole setup the way they did this
it's it definitely divorces itself from its surroundings I could tell you that and like
we need to go directly through them well it's a different area it's like a different it's a
different religion you know one of the one of the scholars I highly recommend Daniel Boyarin
um who's a rabbinic scholar um he has a book called I think it's beyond border lines or border
lines and he shows he's shows how christianity and rabbinic Judaism came up together they're
like sister religions you know and you know rabbinic Judaism from an internal perspective
is the natural continuation of what was there before it's just it just is what was right it's
just is but from an academic and historical perspective it's a different religion you know
that's related to that comes out of 1st century or perhaps 1st century c or 2nd century 2nd sorry
1st century or 2nd century bce maybe starts around the time of the Hasbunians and we can go into that
a bit more another time as well tying it all together because you can literally tie it together
um but just reading the text it feels different it sounds different right the language and the
way people talk is different the way we understand the the laws are different yeah
this has been a really interesting I know we're going to take a deep dive into this connection
between Josephus's work on Vespasian and what happened with one of the rabbis and stuff and
the way that it is uh there seems to be a big connection that you caught your eye on I will
dive deep into that next time ladies and gentlemen check out the upcoming video that we're going to
do you're not going to want to miss it this has been a great little uh introduction to the kind
of ideas you're going to get when you get into the Talmud the Mishnah to Sefta you name it all the
Jewish writings and why we could create a religion out of something that you know you have to ask
yourself what do you do no more sacrifice no more temple no more and here they're already creating
very cleverly a whole another way of practicing their ancient tradition without practicing some
of their ancient tradition and thank you Dan Jacobs any final words you'd like to say to the
audience before we go um check out all the links um there's lots that I didn't go through that's
really cool stuff in there and um yeah it's great and um join the patreon because I I've joined it
