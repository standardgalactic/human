I have literally been waiting for years to have a conversation with Dr. Jason Staples
and here it is.
There have been many groups that I've learned a lot from and have been encouraged to study
deeper on.
The topic of Israel and Jews and is there a distinction and what it actually means
has been of interest to me because I see Paul as an apocalyptic figure thinking at any moment
now on the timetable of God the end is about to happen.
What end?
The end of the age.
I honestly think Paul thought Jesus, whoever and however you view him was going to come
back and take his people off the earth and then maybe the book of Revelation has the
idea that the new Jerusalem would come down.
Now of course I don't believe those things but nonetheless I think that this man did
and I think there was a guy who taught these churches, these actual Gentiles who weren't
literally Israelites that having faith in Christ and having the spirit of Christ, of
the Holy Spirit if you will, they became Israelites.
Watch this episode and let me know what you think.
Dr. Jason Staples theories are radical, they're new but they're not without warrant and I
hope you guys stay tuned and check it out because I personally think he's on to something.
Let me know what you think in the comment section, join the patron because this comes
up early.
We are MythVision.
Welcome back to MythVision Podcast.
I'm your host Eric Lambert.
If you're new to the program stay tuned because I can guarantee you you're going to learn
a lot.
I know I did and especially reading from the gentleman's book that we're going to be interviewing
today, Dr. Jason Staples, welcome to MythVision my friend.
It's a pleasure to be here.
I'm so glad your book is finally out.
I get to have the opportunity to educate the general public and make others aware of
this work.
It's a fantastic work.
It really is.
I truly, truly appreciate it but before we actually get into any of that, I first want
others to know maybe a little bit about you and the most important things, not how many
dogs and cats you have on this particular show, it's what your credentials are.
Dr. Jason A. Staples, PhD at UNC Chapel Hill, he was a student of Dr. Bart Ehrman.
He is an assistant teaching professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies
at NC State University where he teaches courses on biblical literature, early Judaism, Christian
origins, ethics, globalism, conflict, and various theoretical perspectives in the study
of religion and society.
I have been told by your colleagues that you're a pit bull and they meant that in a positive
way.
You are the last guy on planet earth that anyone really wants to debate because when
you're on something, it's like he's really, he's confident and so that I'm going to appreciate
a ton in this episode.
So I might as well go ahead and introduce people to the book.
The book that you just came out with, which is going to be highly controversial, I apologize,
with some of the scholars that you mentioned in here like John Jay Collins, these are big,
heavy hitters.
They all have different ideas and that's one of the things I appreciated most.
The idea of Israel in Second Temple Judaism, a new theory of people, exile, and Israelite
identity.
You have to read this book.
I'm not just saying that.
I went through this thing.
It took me just a few days.
I had to go and actually go back, reread, listen to what he's saying.
We're going to be talking about this as well as an article that he actually wrote back
while it was published in 2011.
You had versions of this in 2006 if I'm not mistaken.
Yep.
This project and actually the article and this first book and the second book, which
I'm now finishing, are all part of a project that goes back to roots in a term paper I
wrote in 2003.
This has been an 18-year project to this point that should be wrapping up this year.
I'm very much looking forward to having this all off my plate because it has been a grind
to finish this whole bit.
Hopefully it will have been worthwhile in the end and I think the results of the project
will be pretty good.
Well for anyone who doesn't know, I'm super pleased to be able to be the person you can
unload some of this material onto and to let the world find out about what do the Gentiles
have to do with all Israel, a fresh look at Romans 11, 25 through 27.
This is just an article.
He's writing a book currently that will be out next year and we're going to be promoting
that as time goes by, where he's not just dealing with Romans 11, even though that's
like a pivotal elbow and a tough spot for many scholars.
Make sure you go check him out at JasonStaples.com.
All of this is down in the description, ladies and gentlemen.
I ask everybody to go check it out because this is important to me and I know that sounds
narcissistic, but if you've been watching MythVision and you know how important topics
are to me and I say this topic's important, that's this is one of the most intriguing
topics to me because Paul is so enigmatic.
He's so mysterious and we've got people who think, well, Paul within Judaism, we've got
guys who say he was completely anti-Judaism.
You can't figure him out.
Well, I think Dr. Staples is onto something here and I think everyone else should check
him out as well.
So where do we begin?
How do we start this thing?
Your show.
Well, I say that to say, I guess your book started out by saying we can't just start
at the end.
We kind of have to give a backdrop.
But what you did is you started with Josephus, something magical happened.
You said he didn't actually start there.
But like where I felt what you were trying to say was, look at Josephus, what's this
guy doing in the first century?
He's using you Dios, you know, Jews and you deal with that issue, too.
Like, are they Jews?
Are they Judeans?
Is it a local thing?
And you're actually arguing it's not just a locality.
It's a group of people.
That might be important to just point out as well as he uses Hebrew or Hebrews, Jews
and Israel as distinct terms.
They don't always have the same meaning.
Jews are a subset of Israel.
So defining these terms are important before we do a, you know, I guess a back to the
future or back to the past type of thing.
Starting to remind me of the movie The Other Guys, where he's like, well, you know, the
best way to tell a story is to start at the end and then go back.
Anyway, so, so yeah, I mean, I think the to to back this up to where it all really started
with me on this back in 2003, I was going through actually an undergrad class on this
was at Florida State University on the prophets on the on the biblical prophets in the Hebrew
Bible.
And there were a few things that sort of stood out in that class, but one of them really
stuck with me.
And it's something that I ended up starting to look at more closely as I worked toward,
you know, the end of that class.
And that was one of one of the books that we were reading was by Gordon McConnell, who
who mentioned that Israel that, you know, when you see Israel in in Jeremiah, or in
Isaiah, second Isaiah, that it's interesting that they keep using the term the way that
they do.
But it's tricky to understand exactly what they mean by it because, you know, the term
changed meaning, essentially, or, you know, the term has different references over time.
And in particular, he made this one comment that he said, you know, Jeremiah prophesies
about Israel.
But you know, who is Israel when, you know, the Northern Kingdom has been gone for 150
years, and they're the ones that went by Israel.
And that got me going like, wait a second, that that's kind of an important point.
And ultimately, within scholarship, the normal way of understanding that is that basically
Israel just comes to mean the Jews.
That is, you know, the Yahudim or the people from, you know, from from Judah, essentially
that Jew and Israelite come to be synonymous terms effectively by the time you get into
these these later periods.
And so, you know, that just kind of sweeps that that that that question passed a little
bit.
But it stuck with me.
And it was something that I wanted to explore a good bit more, because it is true that when
you read the Hebrew Bible, there is a distinction, there's a difference that's made between Israel,
which could be the 12 tribes, you know, could be the whole people, it could be referring
to the patriarch, or it could be referring to the Northern Kingdom over and against the
Southern Kingdom, which went by Judah.
But then the Northern Kingdom doesn't last as long as Judah.
And so the question is, does Judah just adopt this, you know, title of the what had been
for a long time, the stronger kingdom that, you know, had a little bit more cachet, perhaps
in the region, do they just adopt that and kind of tag that on as their thing or not?
And so then you get the question of also all these biblical prophets, or just Israel, or
Jacob, or, you know, a number of these different things.
And you start to wonder, like, okay, are they being precise here?
Are they just using different words because it's, you know, for style or whatever?
And within scholarship, a lot of times you see people use Israel and Israelite and Jew,
or Israel and the Jews interchangeably, and they interchange them for style because it's
less repetitive.
But I ultimately, after starting along this line, concluded that, and it started by looking
at Jeremiah at the time, but I concluded that the biblical prophets, when they were
talking about Israel, tended not to be talking about the same group as what was meant by
the Jews.
Instead, what we see with Jews is that Jew ties back to Judah, to the Yehudim in Hebrew,
or, you know, Yehudios in Greek, or Yehudios, they don't have a sound so in Greek so that
the transliteration is a little different.
But basically, my takeaway was that when Jeremiah, for example, promises a new covenant with
the House of Israel and the House of Judah, that's really important language because that
actually means, when you put those two together, the House of Israel is, I lost you for a second
there.
You said the House of Israel, the House of Judah is super important, and then you said
the House of Israel and then cut out.
When you put the House of Israel and the House of Judah next to each other in these texts
throughout the Hebrew Bible, it pretty much always, everywhere else where it's not ambiguous
or where there's no question involved, that is referring to the northern and southern kingdoms.
That's the way of referring to that, or the northern people and the southern people.
Has anyone ever tried to do a Hebrew parallelism there by saying, with the House of Israel
and the House of Judah, has anyone tried to argue, oh, that's the same thing, it's a
Hebrew parallelism?
It's never really been argued that I know of, that that's been argued like that that's
formally parallelism, but at the same point, a lot of modern scholars sort of have unconsciously
treated it as such when they actually address how this prophecy is worked out or how other
similar language in the Hebrew Bible actually is worked out in the Second Temple period.
I was not persuaded by that, and so I was determined to take a look at how these terms
and how the concepts that they're working with work across, not just say the book of Jeremiah,
but across biblical literature and then well into the Second Temple period all the way up into
New Testament authors and so on, and that's where I'll get to in the second book.
But basically, I wanted to see how are these people using these concepts?
What do they mean when they say Israel?
Do they mean like what modern scholars tend to when they say Israel, they mean the Jews?
Or is it something else?
And my determination was after looking at a lot of this as much literature as we have available
to us, in addition to some other evidence, it's not within specific texts, is that that is not
the way that these terms were handled and that these concepts were handled in the Second Temple
period.
It seems like that's also, I have to admit, after even just recently interviewing Zvi Benit,
Dr. Benit, he points out like this lost tribe myth and admittedly a mythology here,
it lives, it's alive today.
I mean, people still see a distinct group out there as necessary and a lot of them want to say,
were that group or someone else is that group?
And you know, I think I brought it to your attention that there's a group of Preterists.
I came out of the Preterist background and they like, they see salvation for Israelites,
ethnic only.
That means only the 12 tribes, literally.
And this is what actually, I have to give them thanks.
You know, when you deal with groups that kind of make you motivated to look into something,
and then all of a sudden you get stuck and sucked into this black hole and you're like,
okay, I'll mention this to other scholars like, I'm not interested in that topic,
they'll say, and I'm like, how could you not be?
I'm like you in the sense that what you say, I pick up and I'm loving it.
So assuming, mentioning like, let's say, everyone, Ezra, Nehemiah, all the prophets,
going into the extra biblical stuff, as people call it, kumran scrolls,
all of these things show a distinction.
Northern, Southern, the Northern seem to be non-existent 100 to 150 years after their exile
in the North.
History has them lost, they become assimilated, if I'm not mistaken.
Can you?
Well, it's a little more tricky than that.
So it's a little more complicated because the, what the texts say and what we find
in archeological evidence are not exactly the same, right?
So you have to be able to read through specific rhetoric.
You have to be able to read through polemical argument.
So you get this impression.
So I'll walk back just a second.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take me through this.
So when you read the book of Joshua, for example, the reader could be forgiven
for imagining that by the end of the book of Joshua, Israel had wiped out the entire land
of all the Canaanites who lived there because there's a lot of totalizing language,
that they went in and they destroyed all the males.
And then you get to the beginning of the book of Judges and there's still a ton of Canaanites
around and the people are still not, it's not actually all that unified at this point.
You're like, what happened?
And then you read, say, Joshua much more closely and you recognize that when you've got a lot
of this language of all or every kind of thing here that, oh, they went in and they wiped out
and they cast out all the Canaanites who lived in that area, all is a way of referring to,
like, they had great victory.
But you understand that this is a little hyperbolic because the next chapter,
it refers to those who are left in the same region, right?
Even in the book of Joshua.
And so you get similar things in 2 Kings, where in 2 Kings, in 2 Kings 17,
it's talking about the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, essentially the end of the
Northern Kingdom, which by that point is only a rump state anyway.
So to give you a little bit of history for those of you who are coming along to this
with less background, I know, Derek, you have pretty strong familiarity with this stuff at
this point, but not everybody who's watching is or listening is going to have that.
If you go to the 8th century, at the beginning of the 8th century BCE,
the Northern Kingdom of Israel is in a pretty strong place.
And this is where the big power player that had taken over control of that region in the
prior century, which was Assyria, they're from Northern Mesopotamia, the Assyrians
were undergoing sort of a lull in their power because of some, basically some weakness in the
dynasty that was controlling things at the time and a variety of regional struggles and all of that.
So the Northern Kingdom of Israel and also the Southern Kingdom of Judah as well to a lesser
extent, but they enjoyed a bit of a bounce back as they didn't maybe have to pay quite as much in
taxes. They started to fortify, they started to enjoy some benefits of a little more independence
than what they'd had. And as you had a transition from one dynasty to another,
they ultimately stopped paying their taxes to the larger big dog on the block. And they thought
that they could get together a group of regional groups like themselves that we can join together
in this conglomerate group and we can take on and keep out the Assyrians this time.
Well, this was when Tiglath the Leaser, the third, had taken over Assyria. And it turned out that he
was a lot stronger than the dynasty that he displaced. And he came in and this is where you
do get pretty close to all in certain cases. The archaeological record shows that in the Galilee
or in certain areas in the Transjordan, if a village had a thousand people prior to the 730s,
you've got like 100 people, evidence of 100 people like 50 years later.
So basically, they emptied out somewhere, there are some estimates that almost 90% of the people
in certain areas that they either killed or deported as a result of Israel and the people
of that region, this is also the kingdom of Damascus and some other regional players,
that they basically came in and they made their point and they subjected these people again and
lots of the rebels and people in that region, they scattered out. So there's a lot of that.
But you still have Samaria and sort of the central power base of the Northern Kingdom that
then is subjected to Assyria for a while longer. They rebelled again about 10 years later and then
they fell at that point. So this is what's going on in the North. Now, in II Kings, you get this
impression that basically when Assyria finally topples the final king of Samaria and converts
the region into a province of Assyria basically, so they remove any political independence,
that they basically deport all of the Israelites and then they bring in some people from Babylon,
Kutah, etc. But that's not exactly, they didn't deport every Israelite. And if you read the text
carefully, it's hyperbolic and it says Israel was deported, but it also recognizes like there are
people that were left behind. I mean, come on, right? I mean, they didn't get everybody and
line up everyone from the region and go. They took the most important people who could
contribute something in their stuff and they took a number of other people and then
they left some of the lowest class people behind and then they moved in people from
other areas and all of that. So there's still Israelites that remained some
in some of these regions and the biblical authors are aware of this. But here's the thing,
they argue that, well, even the ones that were left, they intermarried with the people
that Assyria brought in. And so they're not really fully Israelite anymore and those other
people are really the people that we're dealing with. Even though historically speaking, when you
start looking at the evidence in the archaeological record in all of this, there's not really that
big of a material change in culture, which you would expect if you had basically a wholesale
change in population. So what that means is that those who came in largely did assimilate
as far as we can tell and the people from that region still called themselves Israelites.
Even if they were foreigners, they became, they assimilated to the Israelites, so to speak.
So from their perspective, these people were Israelites, right? Now, here's the thing,
from the perspective of the people from Judah, well, you're not really Israelite,
and this starts out and we see this go all the way into the New Testament with the whole
question of the Samaritans. The Samaritans, and this is where one of the things that I do
early in this book is I show that, look, when you look at the evidence, the Samaritans in the
first century, in the first century BCE, in the first century CE, in a couple of centuries prior
to that, they're the people that are calling themselves Israelites. They continue to call
themselves Israelites and they're the Israelites who worship at Har Garazim at Mount Garazim.
So these people continue to call themselves Israelites. They continue to, and actually when
you read Ezra and Nehemiah, they're actually some of the big opponents of Ezra and particularly
Nehemiah who do not regard them as part of the same. Nehemiah in particular regards them as
rivals to the project that he's part of and that they're enemies of proper worship of the God of
Israel who's supposed to be based in Jerusalem, dang it. If I may, this is so interesting because
from what I've understand in psychology, the closest people to us are our biggest enemies.
And so number one, I wanted to ask you one little historical fact. They say that Jerusalem or Judah
doubled in size. Was this during this time after they took the elites or was that hundreds of years
later? And then the second question, because I'm double whammy in here, because you really,
I love this. I love it when you run with these. It seems like Ezra and Nehemiah, as I read in
the book Goi by Adio fair Anishai Rosensee, it seems like they were like, they were anti-Mary
everyone. Like you know how you talk about all doesn't mean all, but like it seems like they're
targeting these groups that you're talking about. Like they're not targeting, targeting
Persians. They're not really targeting, they're not saying those, they list who you're not supposed
to intermarry with. And the ones that aren't mentioned, they could in the history shows
that those people would intermarry. So it's like, you're really being a hypocrite here. It sounds
like in a way by saying only these people, I'm saying that for myself. I'm putting that label,
but you see what I'm saying. Yeah. So two things. One is, I think what you're referring to with the
doubling of Jerusalem, that is toward the end of the eighth century. I think that's what you're
referring to. And that most likely is the result of refugees from the Northern Kingdom who are
coming down to avoid or in some cases immediately in the aftermath of what's happening up there with
the Israelites against the Assyrians. And for what it's worth, the Assyrians come in in the
in the eight thirties. You know why the Assyrians come and do what they do to Israel? Because Judah
calls them in. So this is one of those things. I mean, a lot of people don't read this. You have
to read it, you know, carefully. But this is, this is a big episode in the history of Israel,
in the history of Judah, where Israel is trying to pressure Judah into joining the alliance,
you know, against the evil empire. And Judah says, nah, you know, that's,
we think this is a really bad idea. And it turns out that Israel and Damascus, they attack,
they besiege Jerusalem to try to force it. And so Judah sends to Assyria saying, hey,
you might want to be aware of what's going on here. Can you come in and get them off our lawn?
And that's what happens. So, and for what it's worth, it turns out there's a really interesting
article from a few years ago by Stephanie Dally, who looks at some of the evidence that has been
unearthed from some of the, some of the graves of the Queens of the, of this dynasty of Assyrian kings
have been, they've been archaeologically unearthed and have been examined and all of this.
And there are a couple of them, including Tiglath Polizer, one of Tiglath Polizer's wife, who's
actually called his queen, which probably makes her the favored one. And then the, and then the
wife of, I think, Sargon, each of them has Yath euphorics in their name, which suggests that
they might be Jewish princesses. And there's no icons of any sort in their grave goods, which
is unusual among the other, the other, other bits. And so any other graves that they found.
So there's some argument that maybe there's even a marriage alliance that's going on here
between the southern kingdom of Judah and the Assyrians at this time, which gets back to
that transitions into this other question. That would explain why they don't attack. Yeah,
they don't really attack Judah ever. Well, they do when Hezekiah rebels. And, but that's, you know,
another 30 years later. And Hezekiah is doing this in a different context. And it's equally stupid.
Um, but it may account a little bit for why Hezekiah remains king. Assyria, you know, they,
they basically remove all of the strength of his kingdom, but he still stays on the throne. And
there's, you know, biblical explanation for all of that. But it's also interesting that
he and Sennacherim may have been cousins. So, you know, based on, again, this is based on the
finds at Asher at the time, I think, I think their graves at Asher. So, you know, and that's,
that's all really interesting stuff, but it gets to the other thing, which has to do with the
intermarriage, intermarriage question. And intermarriage was forbidden for Israel in the Torah.
You see, and you see these prohibitions, they're forbidden to intermarry, not with everybody,
but only with the seven Canaanite nations, because they're the ones that essentially are
culturally their rivals to Israel, right? If you marry these, if you marry people from them,
then you're just going to become them. But if other people from elsewhere want to marry into you,
well, they're not, their culture is not a threat to us, because when they marry in,
they're going to become part of us. That seems to be a lot of the logic here. And so, and this
is something that Goy, I think, gets right effectively in looking at how, in Ophir and
Rosenvies analysis of this, that they're understanding that this is a cultural question
that they're trying to protect. And so, yeah, you're getting a rivalry even into the Second
Temple period between Northerners from the region that is traditionally Israel and Southerners from
the region that is traditionally Judah. And this accounts for why, when you get the return of
the Rubabael and that whole crew and Sheshbazar and all of those people to rebuild the temple
and all of these things, and then Ezra, they don't establish the state of Israel or the province of
Israel, they establish the state of Yehud or of Judah. Why? Well, because they're Judahites.
They know full well that Israel is a larger thing. Now, they try to get that larger thing back,
and I think that's the thing. And that's really where I ultimately go as the second stage of my
book, is arguing that once you recognize this difference, you can start to see how this is
actually impacting the way that Jewish theology gets built in the Second Temple period, and also
how these expectations and all of these things work out in a variety of different ways. So,
this is a wonderful part of your book. You actually are painting a really good picture because it
seems like, you know, they say winners write history. Well, the winners in this kind of cause
are Judahites. They're from the south. And so, the new capital, so to speak, isn't, you know,
going to be Mount Garazim. It is Judah. And the prophecies, this is what really gets me
intrigued on this topic, is these prophecies of the returnees of Israel, which carry off various
myths like Azeroth, and, you know, they're beyond the river, they're behind a mountain,
all these things that like, they're out there, they're beyond the Euphrates, Josephus. All of these
myths, they expect them to come back to Zion, being Jerusalem as the new, like, this is going to be
the place. But what gets me, and why I think this is hilarious, is what you're suggesting, as many
scholars do, is the Samaritans are Israelites, and they've been claiming it from day one, whether
they're mutts, it doesn't matter. They're still part of this whole program. They believe they're
part of it. The winners who are predominantly writing on this literature from the south,
and they don't view them that way for the most part. You do point out there's certain people who
kind of have a different tendency and macabees and whatnot. I can't remember. It's third, fourth,
one of those two. You go through it all. But it's like they're prophesying for these guys to come
back, and these guys are right under their nose, because the ones they're asking for, they don't
exist. There's no diaspora out there of Israelites going from the eighth century, other than the
Samaritans. That's a little tricky. Again, the facts on the ground are pretty messy.
Again, what we're dealing with is we're dealing with texts that are putting forward, and this
show is called Myth Vision. We're dealing with the myth. For those of you who,
probably not very many who are listening to this, but for those of you who might be offended by
the word myth, we're dealing with the story of where this is all going. That smooths out a lot
of the edges, but there are a couple of things. One is the Samaritans actually don't claim to be
all of Israel any more than the Jews claim to be all of Israel either. The Samaritans regard
themselves as descended from the tribes of Joseph, which are the chief tribes that are ruling
Israel through most of its history. The northern kings generally come from the tribe of Ephraim,
but there's also all sorts of other tribes of Israel that actually before the fall of Samaria,
which is mostly dealing with Manasseh and Ephraim, which are in that central plain area,
in the Galilee or basically in the area that is along that same line, you have
a variety. You've got Naftali. You've got Asher. You've got Rubin. You've got some of the
Transjordanian Manassites. You've got the tribe of Dan that's up there on the way to Damascus.
You've got a variety of different tribes that are there in the northern kingdom that they do by
and large disappear in terms of having their own distinct identity, in terms of having their own
distinct tribal status within the group. The Samaritans understand themselves as from the
tribes of Joseph, but they're not actually arguing that they're all 10 tribes up there.
Even in that case, you can make the argument that even for those Jews who would accept
the Samaritans as part of Israel, and I think you can make a case that the earliest Christians,
after the ministry of Jesus, one of the things that you see in the Book of Acts and you see some
real strong attention to this even in the Gospels of bringing the Samaritans on board becomes an
early priority. I think this is part and parcel of the restoration of the larger
full 10 tribe thing, but you can't just stop it at Samaria. You have to go to the ends of
the earth to get the rest. This is where you get something like the Great Commission, Judah,
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Well, where's that all coming from? It's coming from
this larger story that is talking about Israel, that most Jews see the Samaritans as rivals who
are not really authentic. There's some really interesting material that we found in the Dead
Sea Scrolls, for example, that looks forward to the day when they're going to be wiped out of that
area and then the real Israelites are going to be brought into their rightful land. These sorts of
things are there, but then you've got others that have a different view, but in any case,
Israel is never really thought of as complete or under their nose by any of those groups. There's
always this sense of incompleteness that's there, and there is evidence of an Israelite diaspora
for a century or two initially after the fall of the Northern Kingdom. We know this because
of some of the Assyrian materials that have been found in terms of archaeological
and also some textual lists of people who are commanders in the Assyrian army or various
administrative roles within the Assyrian Kingdom. They have Yathuaphorics in their name,
and they appear to be identified as Samarians or as Israel, as they're identified as various parts
of Israel that they're there. There seems to be some diaspora initially, but we think of this
time period as moderns. We think of this time period as moving pretty quickly, but you imagine
this happens, let's say you're taken into exile in 730 or after the fall of Samarian 722 when
the Assyrians finally come and decide to deport some people in the late 700s. Okay, well,
two generations go by. Are your children really likely to maintain endogamous
relationships when your overall group is scattered pretty significantly? I mean,
you look at the United States, 100 years is a long time, 150 years is a really long time,
and very quickly you start to see people intermarry and basically become Assyrians or become,
they mix in with whatever groups that they're a part of, and that happens over time,
but there is evidence for early on in particular some Jewish or some Israelite. There's definitely
evidence for later for Jewish communities that do a better job of maintaining endogamous
maintenance of community boundaries, but there is evidence for some time of Israelite
communities that are out there essentially in the Assyrian territory, which I think also helps
give rise to why there's still this expectation among lots of Jews that these communities,
these people are going to come back and they're going to be reunited with us Jews from the South
under the Davidic King and things are going to be as they should and so on. And that this is
the expectation, I think, that ultimately leads to a lot of early Jewish theology. It develops
a hopeful eschatology, a hopeful expectation of the future that is, I think, a defining feature
of what becomes early Judaism. And it's, I think, a big reason why Judaism has been so successful
in maintaining a people for, I mean, we talked about how long centuries, we're talking about
millennia now, where this has been that powerful of a narrative that it has continued to preserve
the people who have held tight to it. This is amazing what you're pointing out, because I think
it's important also to point out in these times, gods are usually attached to the land. So when
you're not in that land anymore, it doesn't take too long usually, unless you start to, like you
talk about there's a reform, so to speak, in the Jewish communities on bringing God out there,
now prayers, it's not required that you have to be at this temple or, you know, they have a change
starts to take place. But my question to be point blank, right? Because this is, I know it's not a
yes or no all the time. That's how amazing history really is. But on the text, they think they're
really there. In reality, they assimilate to a point where we have no reason to say in the first
century, there are authentic northern diaspora tribes floating around in Rome. This addresses a
complex issue that the groups that I usually talk to, they think the Athenians and the Parthians and
the various pagans, and they don't even like that word, because they say that word's Latin,
and Gentile doesn't mean it gives no ethnicity to it. So maybe we can delve into a little bit of
New Testament, if you don't mind. Are you cool with that? That's fine. I mean, this ultimately does
have a lot of bearing on that question. I mean, that's a big part of what's going to motivate
people to want to look at this stuff to begin with, right? So yeah. How would you tackle that?
Because to be point blank, I guess, northern diaspora, Israelites, they might have held out
for some time, but in history, they were lost to it. They were never lost to it ultimately,
because the myth is more powerful than technically the reality, which is why they came up with their
across the river, and they're on the other side of the mountain. They're out there. They're going to
come back. God's going to be faithful. And you do this with Paul by showing, while he was faithful,
by Paul's pointing out, what he's doing here is he's ensuring that the prophecies are being fulfilled.
And I see Paul as a very imminent expecting something to happen soon. So he's trying that
apocalyptic, what timetable, so to speak, in his head, is any moment now. So we're wrapping up
prophecies, but I'm jumping ahead here. So I'm putting words in your mouth that I don't want to
put. I want you to set the record straight from the research that you've done, where they're lost
to Israelites actually in the Roman Empire that weren't Jews.
So there were Israelites, or there were people who claimed to be Israelites who were not Jews. We
know this because they identify themselves. So there's this really interesting, it's from just
before the Roman period, but there's this interesting inscription that was found on Delos
that refers to the Israelites who worship at Mount Gerizim. So it's a way of referring to
themselves. They refer to themselves as Israelites, not Jews. And they specifically identify that we
are the Israelites who worship at Mount Gerizim, or who worship the God at Har Gerizim. So they're
not a Jewish group. They claim to be Israelites, but they're Samaritans. So you do have Samaritans
that are present in places in addition to just the region of Samaria in the Roman Empire.
And that makes sense because you have a continued community of people who identify as Israelites
at Samaria. You're going to expect that not all of them are going to all live there. You're going
to have relations with other peoples and all of these other things. So that's not surprising.
And you have some evidence of that. Aside from that, there's zero evidence
that anybody else across, not just the Roman Empire, but across the world at that point,
would have understood themselves to be Israelites that were not Jewish. Now, what we do see is,
and you mentioned this a little bit, is within Jewish texts, within, in particular,
these apocalyptically focused texts. Essentially, as the world of contact expands, the horizon
expands with it to where the Israelites who are out there somewhere are always just over the horizon.
So they're beyond the Euphrates, for the people for whom beyond the Euphrates is
out of mind. We don't know where they are exactly, but they're somewhere over there.
And then, you know, right, yeah. And so when you get to people who are, you know, say,
in that region, well, they're over, you know, they're further out there somewhere. And this
is what you get is that there's this sort of pushing of the horizon where they're out there.
We know they're out there. They have to be out there because the prophets promised that they
would be restored, and they can't be restored if they don't exist. And this seems to be the issue.
So you get something like the Book of Tobit, which is, to me, one of the most fascinating
pieces of early Jewish literature, in that it follows a naftalite who is identified as
a faithful naftalite who actually would, instead of sacrificing in the ways of the northerners and
going to the northern shrines, would actually travel down to Jerusalem to sacrifice in Jerusalem
to be because he knew that that was the right way to do things. You know exactly who the
authors of this are then, right? I mean, this is coming from a southern perspective.
But this tells this story. It's a novella. It's a little novel that tells the story of this
naftalite and the tribe of Naftali was the first tribe to be taken into exile, according to Second
Kings. So, you know, they're taken by Tiglap Pileser as a part of his campaign, and he's among the
first people taken, but he's a faithful naftalite, right? And that matters. And the whole story is
about God making sure that his children, or that his child, and then another naftalite's child,
find each other so that they can have good progeny. And then they ultimately, essentially,
are guided by one of God's angels to continue going east and to go and wait. And eventually,
you know, their descendants are going to come back. And this is the hope at the end of the book,
is that, you know, Naftali isn't lost, right? There's still naftalites out there. They're going
to, they're there. They're not allowed to marry other tribes, like Naftali only can marry not,
they can't marry Jews. Well, the thing is, they can, right? But the problem is, if they do, then
you don't have naftalites to restore anymore. So, for the purpose of the book, they're so devout,
they're so focused on this. And God is so concerned to make sure that all of Israel will
ultimately be regathered as expected, that he makes sure that the naftalites are, that even
the first tribe, the ones that nobody knows where they are, that they're out there somewhere. And
we know this because when you read the book of Tobit, you see that Tobit and his family were
faithful, God provided for them. And he told them, well, Assyria is going to fall soon. So,
you guys need to go further east and you'll be taken care of out there and then just keep going,
right? And eventually they're in New Zealand somewhere, right? So, this is that idea. But
there isn't, there isn't any archaeological evidence. There isn't any textual evidence of
people who are actually doing this, who are actually understanding themselves to be the
naftalites somewhere. I do think that there's probably vestiges in different places where,
maybe there was an Israelite community that lasted for a good bit of time. And then it
culturally impacted the people that were around it, but eventually they assimilated.
And so, maybe if you had great evidence and the right anthropology
to do, you could find like, this may have been an area that you can see these various
influences that are coming in that may have been Israelite, something like that. But that's as
far as we can get. And they marry in. And this, to me, is one of the things that actually becomes,
I don't know, I don't think Paul was necessarily the guy who came up with this solution. But he's
the one that argues it most ardently and clearly, is I think Paul basically makes the case that
when you read the prophets, when you read Amos, or when you read Hosea in particular,
Hosea says to the Northern Kingdom, you are not my people. And Paul goes,
it's been hiding in plain sight all this time, everybody. The Israelites became not my people.
Well, who are not my people, folks? That's all the other peoples. Israel became indistinct.
There isn't an ethnic separation between the people that Hosea is addressing and the other
nations. They became part of those other nations. Well, if God's then going to restore Israel,
the not my people that he promises that to in Hosea, then that means he has to bring in really
not my people. That means he has to go to people who are actually gent. These are not Israelites.
And so for Paul, this ends up being the... First of all, I think he and the earliest Christians
are responding to the question. They start to see people who are uncircumcised men,
who are showing whatever it looks like, the signs of having received the Spirit
that they understand as a part of the New Covenant, which is a promise of Israel's restoration.
And then you got some serious stuff to explain. God-fearing, God-fearers and things like this.
Yeah, that sort of thing, but men who have their foreskins. Right. And if that guy has the Spirit
that is promised to Israel, and it's only promised to Israel in the prophets, then you have a whole
lot of explaining to do. You have to figure out, wait a second, you're going back to your text,
where is this coming from? That guy still has his foreskin, and I know he still has his foreskin,
and I'm not sure where this is coming from, but we got to figure out what's going on here and how
this actually relates to the prophecy, because this is supposed to be for Israel. Right. And so
then the explanation, there are a few different possibilities. One explanation is you can say,
well, this is how God is restoring Israel, and now they need to be circumcised.
And this becomes the argument. This is why you would need to circumcise somebody. You don't circumcise
somebody in this context unless you actually think they're becoming a part of Israel.
But Paul argues, no, no, no, we're not understanding something here. God said that he would restore
Israel and Judah, and if we circumcise them and they effectively become Jews, then this is really
only saving Judah. But this is God's way of bringing in the rest of Israel, because the rest
of Israel intermarried with all of these other people, and so the only way to bring in the rest
of Israel is to bring in everybody, to open the doors to all of the rest. And so I don't think
he is imagining that every person who receives the Spirit is a lineal descendant of an Israelite
somewhere, because all that's necessary here is that he's making the connection between Israel
became not my people, and now not my people are being saved. Well, that opens the door to all
not my people. Right. And that's, this is the heart. This is why when I wrote you and said,
hey, okay, so there seems to be universal Ta ethne, if you will, the nations, a plural other
than Israel, there seems to be implications of promises in Jeremiah or Isaiah that sound like
something that's the light will go to the nations like bigger than just Israelites. And then there's
some places that sound like Israelites will be scattered among the nations. So there's this group
I deal with that conflates them to make them one and the same. And when they do so, they're trying
to still keep it ethnic. And one of the things I think is interesting too, as I read through Second
Temple Judaism material and Dead Sea Scrolls is how, how non liking these Jews are towards the
Gentiles. Yet Paul comes on the scene doing like the, the homilies and, and other texts that are
very pro Gentile over against that are like anti Gentile. There's like seemingly two different
crowds. One can't wait for the rod to come and destroy the nations. The other side is saying,
you know, look, there's, there's something that can be good at this. And you're saying Paul seems
to be more of a cosmopolitan type of Jew who's in the, in the, in Rome, on the ground, seeing
God fears and saying, all right, I'm a biblical minded Jew. I'm looking at the text and I see
this must be a fulfillment of the end. This is something that's actually happening here.
He's restoring Israel, but also do you think he's also simultaneously fulfilling
prophecies that the nations would see when the restoration of Israel would come in?
It seemed like Israel would rule the world and the nations would come to Mount Zion,
you know, saying, teach us the truth, you know, is this what's going on?
So yeah, I think, I think the thing that, that is really interesting about what he does
is he does, I think, kind of combine the two aspects. So I think he understands the blessing
of the nation. So you've gotten in Galatians three, right? Galatians three, 12, 13, 14. He says, you
know, that Christ died, Christ freed us from the curse of the law so that you've got this,
this Hina clause, this so that clause where he says so that the nations would receive the blessing
of Abraham or the nations would be included in the blessing of Abraham or actually says a better,
better translation of that would be so that the nations might, so that the blessing of Abraham
might come to the nations. That's a better translation of that. And then, then he has the
second Hina, which assumes the first one, where he says, and there's no and, so that the blessing
of the nations might come to the nations so that we might receive the promise or the spirit,
the spirit of promise. And he puts those two things together, the spirit of promise is promised
to Israel. And then, of course, you have the nations that are promised to, you know, Israel's
supposed to bring about justice to the nations and all these things. And he understands this as
the promise to the nations is actually fulfilled through the promise to Israel. And the promise
to Israel is fulfilled through the incorporation of the nations in the promise to Israel. So the
whole thing kind of ends up being, you know, it's a way for God to kind of elegantly tie it all
together with one move that was unexpected. All the while, you still have a distinction between
there are Jews and Gentiles who still are circumcised and uncircumcised within the church,
and they have to learn to live together. And he sees the boat, he sees both of those working
together as all one move, so that the promises to the nations and the promises to Israel are
all fulfilled in the same movement and the same thing. And that is through the gift of the spirit
that enables people. And this is where I think Paul might be, this might be the single place where
Paul is most misunderstood. Paul is fundamentally focused on ethics and focused on how people live
and whether or not people are obeying God. Now, what that means for him is an interesting thing,
but his whole argument is that God has given the spirit to Jews and Gentiles who follow Jesus in
order to make them obedient, in order to make them agents of justice in the world who love their
neighbor and who love one another and who bring justice to the world. And this is what it's all
about because the prophet's promise, he says, the prophet's promise that, you know, Israel's going to
be restored and in order for Israel's restoration to be lasting, Israel's going to have to receive
a new heart and a new spirit because the reason that Israel wound up in the situation that it's
in to begin with is because they didn't obey, they couldn't obey. And so that needs to be fixed.
And Paul understands his whole thing as fixing that. And that's a problem that Israel has,
that's a problem that Gentiles have is each one ends up having this sin problem that the Torah
can't fix, but the spirit can for him. And so it's supposed to make people into people who become
agents of justice in the world. And it's all tied to this whole idea that is Israel and Judah
have to be reunited, have to be restored, and have to be given a new heart and a new spirit,
which is all part of the prophetic stuff that we see in the Hebrew Bible.
So I hear the children. It's okay, I have kids too. But in this passage that I was pulling
up here in Galatians 3, something maybe we don't have to read through it, of course, because you
and you've read it a million times, I've read it a million times. It sounds like Paul's doing a different
argument in the book of James. Paul's, his argument seems to be prior to the to the actual
circumcision that occurs. God made a promise to him. He made a promise to him. And this promise
seems to be why he's not requiring a demanding circumcision on his Gentile audience. And he
also makes this strange, I like to use spiritual language groups that I'm encountering, they don't
really care for the word spiritual is relied or enumatic is fine. Yeah, I just, I just say, look,
in Christ is the seed of Abraham, singular, he like literally trying to say that on purpose.
He says not plural, like singular. Okay, what does this mean? That means having faith in Jesus
makes you in in Christ, which is a child of Abraham, in a sense, if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah, I think so. This is where I think the work of Matt Teason is really helpful. I really like
his metaphor of Paul understands the people who receive the Spirit, the Pnoma. He understands
this as what we what we today might regard as like a DNA transplant. Right, so they actually are
transformed into the family of Jesus. And of course, Jesus is the one to whom the promise was made.
So for Paul, the interesting thing is that these men and you see this at the at the end of of
Romans chapter two, where he says that the the uncircumcised or the foreskinned man, he actually
uses the he actually uses metonymy where he says, if the foreskin, so you're
you know, okay, that's interesting. But no, if foreskinned man does the Torah,
does the does fulfills the righteous or keeps, he says keeps the righteous statutes of the Torah,
then will not his his foreskin be counted as circumcision. This is the argument that he makes.
And I think where where where where Teason's argument here is helpful is I think Paul understands
that these people who are obedient through the Spirit, through the Pnoma that has been it's
it's Christ's Pnoma. It's a part of Christ that they actually become a part of the body of Christ.
When they become incorporated into Christ, they actually become basically they they are DNA transplanted
such that they are actually they actually are circumcised. They're not circumcised in the flesh,
but it's not the flesh that matters. It's Jesus body that matters and Jesus body is circumcised.
And it's Jesus obedience that works itself out in them through the Pnoma. And so I think that's
basically what he does is he understands this that way, which is why you don't need to be
circumcised in the flesh. Because if you're if if having received the Pnoma and getting the DNA
transplant that says that I'm in fact circumcised because I'm in Christ's circumcision,
and now I need to go ahead and actually make it real by circumcising my flesh,
now I'm acting as though that that's not a real thing.
That's exactly how he argues, too. That's a great point. Like, why is he saying that in Galatians?
And then he's saying just cut the whole thing. He gets so mad. Cut your thing off.
And I don't blame him in his mind now that I see what he's trying to say.
That makes a lot of sense. Can I hit you with a few different, like, how would you answer a certain?
One last thing before we move into this is I actually think that it's worth pointing out that
the epistle of James does not actually mention circumcision, right? So where you have any
distinction or any potential debate between, say, Galatians or Romans and James,
it's fascinating that James says nothing about circumcision, right? That I think is often overlooked
because James is so focused on you have to do these works. Well, read Galatians 5.
Galatians 6. Paul's obsessed with this idea that if you have the spirit, you're going to do these
works. And if you don't do these works, then guess what? You're going to get what you deserve.
And you get the same thing in Romans 2. Both James and Romans 2 say it is not the hearer of the law
that is just before God, but the doer of the law, right? Each in slightly different wording,
but the same concept. So it's worth noting that they're probably in discourse, in dialogue between
the two of them, James and the epistle of James and what we see in the Pauline epistles. But what
we don't see in James is an argument that Gentiles need to be circumcised. And I think
that's a worthwhile distinction to make. But go ahead with your rapid fire.
Well, it's not even rapid fire. It's almost like you pick a verse in the New Testament that sounds
very ethnic focused because all you got to do is quote the Old Testament passage and find out
real quick, oh, that's ethnically related, Hosea 1, running to these passages, Jeremiah 31.
And I mentioned Hebrews 8, 8. The first thing to ask is, who is this author? We know it's not
Paul. At least we don't think it's Paul. Okay, the church is probably putting up Paul. Okay.
And because Paul was known to say I, Paul, but yeah, well, not just that, but the Greek is very,
I mean, if this was if this was Paul, it was Paul writing Paul written by someone other than Paul,
because this is not read like the Greek of any other any other book in the New Testament.
You said the New Covenant's meant for the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
So when someone goes straight to that, and now mind you, the people you're probably dealing with,
Dr. Staples, are usually on the 99% side, which means they're coming from replacement theology,
the four different views you mentioned in your article on Romans 11, 25. So they're usually
coming from one of those positions. This is probably the weirdest initial episode you're
going to do because it's actually the guys who come over and say, I believe everything you
just said, but I go further and say the Gentiles are actual Israelites. And then when you pin them
down and you show that, well, in real history, we have no reason to think these were really Israelites,
they'll run to fiction. So now they want to say Paul's epistles are epistolary fiction,
and they want to suggest it's a fairy tale story. It's like a Cinderella story. This is how they
look at Paul and I'm going, there's too much here to say this isn't a real guy. I can't ignore the
evidence. So they want to say that. I don't want to straw man or poison the well, but I want you
to know that so that you can understand where they go to Hebrews 8, 8, House of Israel, House of Judah.
How can you say these Gentiles, pagans, non-Israelites are part of the new covenant?
They can't be. They run Ephesians chapter two. I'm going to hit fire and let you just address these.
The dividing wall. Don't you know the dividing wall was between Israel and Judah? But in the
second century, we know there's Jew and Gentile distinction, that binary distinction, or the
temple has a court to the Gentiles and inter-court. But anyway, I'd like for you to address some of
this stuff. Ephesians 2, Hebrews 8, 8, Romans 9 through 11, Matthew, they go to Matthew 10 and
Matthew 15. I came only for the lost sheep of the House of Israel. And that's a big doozy, I think,
for them too. If they try to say the Gentiles are literal Israelites, they want to redefine
what Gentile means in Matthew chapter 10. But anyway, I'll stop right there. There's some more
I can bring up to kind of get your thoughts like Revelation 7 to 144,000. Why is the tribe of Dan
not mentioned there? What's going on, man? There's so much here. Yeah, there's an awful lot.
And so I'm going to start with a couple things. One is it's worth noting that in Jeremiah,
in Jeremiah 31, 27, you have this mention, it says days are coming. And remember that the
New Covenant prophecy is four verses later, right? So I'll make a new covenant with the
House of Israel, the House of Judah. Here you have days are coming when I will sow the House of
Israel and the House of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of beasts. So in its original
context, this is probably intended to mean that basically people are going to come back and they're
going to live in this area that are going to be Israelites and Judahites, and they're going to
have livestock and cattle and such as well. But in the apocalyptic world, by the time you get
through Daniel and all of these other things, when you have the seed of beasts that are mentioned,
the beasts or the various animals, it's a way of referring to the nations.
This is a way of saying with the seed of Israel and Judah, sure, but also there's going to be
some others that are going to be a part of Israel and Judah as well. Even in Ezekiel, you have this
mention of the Gaer, the stranger or the foreign sojourner, is to be incorporated and given in
inheritance just like the rest of Israel. I think it's in Ezekiel 40, somewhere in there.
So you already have a precedent for this. And frankly, you can go all the way back into Exodus
where there were people from Egypt who were not Israelite who in Exodus, it mentions that there's
this mixed group of people that comes out in the Exodus with Israel and they get incorporated.
That actually deals with 1 Corinthians 10. One of the problems they say, 1 Corinthians 10 too,
he's addressing his audience in Corinth, these pagans, Derek, you're so wrong. And what is really
happening here, and I said, don't you remember the mixed multitude that did come out through the Red
Sea? So if he was being literal, he could be saying, you're foreigners in a sense, but you're
also part of the community, which makes you part of, I'm just saying. I think the big thing here
is that he, again, over and over again, keeps coming back to the Pneuma. And I think, again,
understanding that it's the Pneuma that changed. So Paul believes that people's ethnicity is
changing when they come into Christ. That's the thing. So part of this problem is that a lot
of people in the modern world think of race or ethnicity in a different way than people in antiquity
did. So there's this idea that, well, obviously, if this is with Israel and Judah, it must be with
people who have the exact DNA as a result of their genealogy goes back. But that's not exactly how
ethnicity has historically worked. And it's certainly not how it worked in those days. You could
actually become a different ethnicity. The work of Denise Buell is probably the
entry point to that. Probably the best entry point to that. She did Why This New Race. It's
back in like 03 somewhere in there. And then Carolyn Johnson Hodge as well. I think it was a 05
book where she talks about a lot of this stuff as well, where you've got understandings of ethnicity
as something that's flexible. It's not something that's rigid. It's not something that can't change.
And for Paul, I think what he understands or the way that he understands this is that by receiving
the Pneuma of Jesus, who is ethnically tied in here, when you receive Jesus' seed or when you
receive Jesus' Pneuma, you become Abraham's seed because you are now part of Jesus. And Jesus is
the seed to whom the promise was made. He's the seed of Abraham. He's the seed of David. So when
you come into Jesus and you receive Jesus' Pneuma, you become a new ethnicity. So for Paul, your
ethnicity is not fixed in the same way that it is. And I think also this is something that a lot of
biblical scholars actually fall into is making distinctions between terms and categories that
the ancient authors don't. So we tend to think about things in terms of religion versus ethnicity,
say, or ethnicity versus culture or race versus these various things. You already mentioned,
and you were right, that in the ancient world, generally speaking, gods were associated with
their specific region, but they also were associated with their specific people. Paul
of Fredrickson has put it well that in the ancient Mediterranean, gods ran in the blood.
Your gods were ethnic. And what's happening here is that by receiving the Pneuma of Jesus,
these people are actually becoming the ethnicity of Israel's god. And that's a distinction. And
actually in my next book, I've actually got a section in here where I actually just pulled it
up on my own screen here where I say, look, the language of ethnic or empirical Israel that you
have people use all the time presents a problem that seems to have gone unnoticed. Functionally,
ethnic or empirical serve as a sort of shorthand to connect Paul's Israel terminology
to the presumably less disputed category of Jews or in some aren't necessarily doing that.
But here's the problem. Adding ethnic or empirical to Israel does not solve the problem or make
things clearer. And I'll give you some examples of this. We like to think of this as though it
implies a scientifically verifiable or self-evident category. So you can know, okay, this person's
ethnically in Israel, this person's not. But okay, what about recent controversies over the
decisions of the Israeli government where there were people who applied for aliyah. This is immigration
to Israel on the basis of being Jewish. And they were denied aliyah to people who were self-identified
as Jews and had been approved as Jews by Jewish groups in the diaspora. So they apply and Israel
looks at their application and says, yeah, you're not Jewish. And it's like, but my family's been
Jewish for three generations at least. You know, what's the deal? And they go, yeah, you don't count.
Wow. Are they Jewish or are they not?
Ethnically. Good luck. Yeah, exactly. I mean, the question is who's making that determination.
And beyond that, you wind up with, you know, and being a part of an ethnos has in the ancient world
always meant association with various cultural and cultic practices and all sorts of other things.
So that, you know, basically, you have this whole notion of elastic boundaries. If you marry into
a Jewish family, let's say you are a Gentile God-fearer and then you have a pretty Jewish girl
over there who happens to catch your eye, you decide to get circumcised as an adult and marry
into the Jewish community. Are you ethnically Jewish? At that point, from biblical standpoint,
yeah, I would say. I mean, but then again, there are some ethnic essentialists among whom
might be, say, the author of Jubilees who would say, you're not really necessarily, right? There are
some, but that doesn't seem to have been the default. The default was, yeah, you're in. But
either way, the next question is, is your child in? When you have a son and now, okay, Dad may have
been an adult circumcised person initially from another nation, but has a son from a Jewish mother,
they circumcised that son on the eighth day, is that son ethnic, ethnically Jewish?
Good question. And so these things get really complicated on the margins. And I think Paul
cuts through that. And he says, you know, at the end of the day, if you are ethnically Jewish,
if you are circumcised, you're born, you are naturally Jewish, you're born, you know,
a Jew to Jewish parents, you, you know, adopted that, you agree with the Torah, you adopted,
it's the Torah, so you know, bar mitzvah to use anachronistic terminology there or ritual there.
But you've become, you've become a son of the covenant and you don't follow Jesus.
Are you ethnically in? I think according to Paul, I think according to Paul, his answer is no.
If you read the end, if you read the end of Romans two, he says, look, if you are circumcised,
and you know, he's already gone through birth and having the Torah previously in that chapter,
if you are circumcised and you don't fulfill the law, then your circumcision becomes uncircumcision,
you're out. And then he makes it clear later on in Romans that the way to fulfill the law
is through following Jesus and receiving the Spirit. And you said in your article,
he also says the natural branches, which is referring to the Jews. This isn't talking about
anyone with the Jews, and he counts himself as one. He's saying, look, they're still,
they can be crafted back in. It's not like God forgot them, but they have to take action on
their own part to participate. They have to be faithful by following Jesus and by receiving
the Spirit. And so for him, the ethnic determiner, the thing that makes you ethnically Israelite.
Lost in there for a second. You're good. Now, go ahead. What makes you an ethnic Israelite?
What makes you an ethnic Israelite? It is tied to his conception of the promises to the Israelite
ancestors. What makes you an ethnic Israelite is actually having the Pneuma that comes from Jesus.
And so this is an ethnic thing for him. So this is an important point, and I'm glad you did what
you did when going to answer those topical Hebrews 8a Ephesians 2, Revelation 7, Revelation 14.
We go to John chapter 7, which isn't one of those heavy hitter ones, but
we're talking about the diaspora. Where will you go to teach the Greeks?
And you said this is really ambiguous. It might be written that way on purpose.
I'd like to address this before we get into Samaritans in the New Testament just briefly,
because it seems like if what you're describing is the case, it makes the most sense to me of
why we have replacement theology. To me, that's, I got you. I got you. But yeah,
that makes the most sense for why replacement theology becomes the next step. So you have
pagans entering this world, and I use the term pagan to just refer to anyone who's not an Israelite,
not a Jew, not a Samaritan, but just a pagan. They join this world, and here now they start,
it becomes so popular, and all this ethnic language that is attached to
national Israel or Old Testament, you know, northern, southern Judah, is now being applied
to people who aren't actually, if you will, a genealogical tie-in to Jews or in some sense
claiming to actually be northern Israelites, but they're now saying they're elect. So here you have
like Clement writing to the church in Corinth, the same church that Paul's writing to saying he was
elect. I mean, it makes sense why they would hijack it or why they use this same language.
Well, see, again, I don't think that's hijacking at that point. What's happened is that the
composition of the group has changed, but Paul and the earliest Christians understand what
they're doing as completely in keeping with the promises to Israel. And when they refer to churches,
what gets translated as churches as Ecclesia, when they refer to the Ecclesia or the church of God,
this is language that we see all through Jewish literature referring to the assembly of Israel
or the assembly of God, the assembly, the eschatological assembly, the group that God is going
to pull together and restore at the end, they're understanding this as that. It just so happens,
and I don't think Paul anticipated that it would work this way. I don't think any of the earliest
Christians exactly anticipated which direction it would go here, but it just so happens that
it became so Gentile-dominated that then it becomes something that becomes a different thing. But
they're understanding this as when you're becoming a part of the Ecclesia, they're not imagining that
you're part of the Gentile church over and opposed to the Jews. They understand this as
this is the assembly of Israel. And then, of course, I think it is a natural development as the
composition of the group changes that they retain that self-understanding. And now there aren't
all that many Jews in the group, and you still have other Jewish groups that don't hold to this,
and now you've got a variety of intergroup disagreements about this. In that respect,
it's very little different from, say, the distinction between the Samaritans and the Jews
that you have in the first century. Okay, so the end is near. Right now, this episode's end is near.
I'm letting you go. We're going to do this again, but I just hit firing. How do you answer Ephesians
to the dividing wall? What is the explanation there from your angle? It seems self-evident
based on what you said, but maybe the horse's mouth might be best to actually say it.
That's a little too much to answer rapid fire, to be honest. I think the big thing there is
he's dealing with the dividing, the division between Jews and Gentiles, and specifically
that the Torah lays out that distinction. And basically what happens within Christ,
or within the Messiah for him, is that as people come into the Messiah, the distinctions that are
made between those who are outside the covenant and those who are inside the covenant by nature
get erased because you're both inside the one with whom the promise of the covenant was made.
So that's more of a question for after the second book, to be honest.
Okay, I will save that one. 144,000 Revelation. So you're asking why is Dan not there?
Well, no, that was just my little, I dropped that, but it sounds like the redemption song is only for
the 144,000. There's a great multitude after that. Seems to be the same group. A lot of scholars say
it's the same group. Some people want to argue, no, they're two separate groups. You have the
nations of your tribe, Kendrick nation, tongue, and then you have the 144,000, which is Israel.
How would you explain that? Because they're arguing, these people often are arguing, it's only about
the same thing you just, it's self-evident. I think the best explanation of what's going
on there, I mean, if you're reading this from an early Jewish perspective, which I think,
again, Revelation is an early Jewish text, is that you're dealing with 12 times 12 times a thousand.
And when you get that kind of number play, you're dealing with, I mean, Revelation is a highly
symbolic book, and you're dealing with a symbolic explanation of who these people are. And I think
what you're dealing with is the fullness of Israel, as it were. But again, I think
certainly Paul, and you know, it's harder to argue, I think you'd have a different argument and you'd
have to deal with some other things when you're dealing with Revelation. If Revelation agrees
with Paul, then that all Israel includes people from every tribe, tongue, nation, and so on,
because it has to. Now, the thing that's really interesting about what's going on in Revelation
is that it has the 12 tribes. And we know that in the first century, you don't have
all 12 tribes running around identifying themselves as various tribes. At most,
you have like five, maybe four, depends on how you handle the Samaritans and whether they
identify themselves as specifically from Manasseh or Ephraim, or are they just identifying
themselves with Joseph, which by the way, you notice that the tribe of Joseph is actually in
the 144,000 rather than separately. But then you have Manasseh in place of Dan. Manasseh means
forgotten, so it's another thing. But what you don't have is people identifying from Naftali or
from Asher or Rubin or wherever. You've got the one mention of Simeon in Luke, but that seems
to be pretty aberrant. So you don't have a whole lot other than that. You've got Judah, Benjamin,
and Levi get pretty much everything else. Maybe Luke is evidence that there's some folks from Simeon
still running around, but that would be our only data point for that. And then you've got the Samaritans,
where all the other tribes coming from. And so Revelation is still having to deal with the same
issues as any Jewish apocalyptic text. And that's really the thing that this first book is dealing
with is looking at how that problem of who is Israel is addressed by different groups
within different texts and across the Second Temple period basically from 600 on. It's looking at how
this issue is dealt with and how this issue is formative throughout that period to explain
what different groups are doing and how they're understanding themselves and how they're defining
their culture and their boundaries and everything else, as all of them are looking back to biblical
Israel as a way to define themselves. And I think that's basically what we're trying to do.
James 1.1, 1 Peter, they do the same thing. I think it goes in the same vein of what you're
saying. So you really don't even have to address it. When he's saying to the scattered tribes,
he's speaking to those in Christ, period, right? I think that's right for James. Yeah. And I'm
inclined to think actually partly on that basis, to think that the Epistle of James is earlier than
most biblical scholars actually put it, because I think James is understanding the people who are
coming into Christ as the Restoration or as restoring scattered Israel and that that first
opening address is interesting evidence of that. And you see the same thing in a couple other places,
but you don't see that language much after you get out of the first century.
And you say 1 Peter is doing it for sure. I think 1 Peter is probably doing the same thing.
Yeah. I think it's a little bit less obvious than the tribal language that you have at the
beginning of James, but I think it's also going on in 1 Peter. Yeah.
Excellent. Last thing, Matthew 10. What the heck's going on? Only go to the lost sheep of the House
of Israel, but no no to the Samaritans and no no to the Gentiles. Is he just a different kind of
Jew you think that's kind of got a different take on this? I think that again, this is part of
Matthew's whole program. Matthew has some specific way of handling Jesus' ministry
during his lifetime, and then you see that what happens as soon as Jesus
is resurrected, what does he tell everybody to do? Okay, now go to the Samaritans and now go to
the ends of the earth and everything else. So there seems to be, he's sent to the lost sheep
of the House of Israel, but we only really get to see who that includes after the resurrection.
And I think that's part of Matthew's sort of narrative frame here, is yeah, he's explaining
what's going on with Jesus, who forbids his disciples to do that work prior to,
and I think part of what's going on is it's prior to Jesus' death, which means that it's prior to
Matthew's notion of the giving of the Spirit, which you don't have quite the same emphasis on,
but I think Matthew probably holds similar to that as what we see in other early Christian
literature, that once Jesus has died and you have the giving of the Spirit that's available,
now those other groups can be brought in because they can actually, their ethnicity can change.
The Pneuma changes them in ways that it's not really available prior to that in the same way,
because Jesus hasn't been glorified. So I think that's all part of what's going on in the New
Testament. But the funny thing is, we've talked a lot about the New Testament in this talk, but
the first book, the book that we're ostensibly talking about, the first book sets a lot of
foundation for this. It's true, but I mean, in that book, I spend, what would you say,
five paragraphs or something like that on the New Testament?
Barely. Look, what got you, what got my attention mainly, Dr. Staples, was the fact that you wrote
that article. Oh, wrong one, right here. So you wrote that article, and that article drew my
attention. So I said, well, I took the journey with you. This book is a must read. It takes you
back into the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible. It tells you about the patriarchs. It explains what
Joseph is. You do more than just stick in the Bible. Sorry, fundamentalist, but he goes outside.
He's going to test your boundaries. So I absolutely recommend anyone and everyone to go get this
book. It is down there in the description. All you got to do is click myth vision, recommend
it to books. I read it. It took me four days, not because I sat there all day reading it, but
I absorbed it. And then I thought, okay, that's a lot to chew on. He deals with anti-Semitic
scholarship on insider, outsider language. I mean, you can't, like, there's not a single thing he
didn't really, like, make a point on to try and prove his point. And he had to delve into various
fields. It's super complex. So there's a lot of different skill sets that are required to master
in those particular fields. And that's what scholarship does, the point in specific things.
So I ask everybody, please go down in the description, get his book. Let's do this again,
Dr. Staples. I really, there's probably more material I could bring up and we could do hip fire
stuff. If the audience likes this, this will be on the Patreon. You guys join the Patreon,
