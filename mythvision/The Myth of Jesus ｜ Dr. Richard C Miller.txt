Dr. Richard C. Miller, we are kicking button taking names and or what is it kicking button
chewing bubblegum and we're on a bubblegum. Your book is fantastic. There's so much to it
that I mean I might have to read it multiple times to even get it let alone for the vocabulary but
like the concepts. I've ran across rank raglan or the idea of the raglan hero archetype and
this I came across in Dr. Richard Carrier's work showing like mythic and heroes who become gods
and all that kind of stuff, demigods and how they might fit into this category. Can you tell us what
the rank raglan hero archetype is? What are you bringing up? What's your use of it here because
his use of it it's more it's deeper than what I'm putting but he's using it in the context of like
did Jesus exist and he's saying look at this category and how many people fit it mostly of
him or mythical rather than historical in his estimation things like that whereas you're using
it differently I think than that and then we also can get into the dreams thing so yeah yeah well
so it's all in the same section here in the book there are a couple points that that I want to
traverse with that one is I think raglan gets sometimes he's get pushed aside a little bit
is kind of not taken seriously no this is serious basically what we're dealing with on the anthropological
level and so anthropology is what what can we know about what humans are up to that transcends
cultures and times and what are the what are the things that the patterns that we that seem to
recur no matter which culture you're in and that's the study in a broad way I mean there's more ways
of talking about anthropology whether you're talking about cultural ancient anthropology kind
of the origins now myths evolve over time there's more to it than that but that's the basic project
and so what can we learn then about heroes and the journey of the hero and the sort of thing
in storytelling across time raglan goes and tries to point out here this is his specialty this is
what he was doing and so he goes and points out I don't know what is it 17 or 18 different
want to read those yeah yeah let me read them these are these are the elements of the hero
pattern according to raglan for those that haven't heard this this is good stuff the hero's mother
this is the first one is is a royal virgin his father is a king that's the second one third one
often a near relative of his mother but fourth one the circumstances of his conception are
unusual and fifth one he is also disputed to be a son of a god sixth at birth an attempt is made
usually by his father or his maternal grandfather to kill him but next one he is spirited away in some
form next one reared by foster parents in a far off country next one we are told nothing of his
childhood but next one on reaching manhood he returns or goes to his future kingdom next one
after a victory over the king and or a giant or dragon or a wild beast or some other villain
next one he marries a princess often the daughter of his predecessor and next one becomes king
next one for a time he reigns uneventfully and next one prescribes law in the next one later
he loses favor with the gods and or his subjects and next one is driven from the throne and city
after which next one he meets a mysterious death next one often at the top of a hill next one his
children if any do not succeed him next one his body is not buried but nevertheless next one
he has one or more holy sepulchres that's the end of the the list so what is the i mean i've never
studied him i've only ran across his argument from richard carrier's work and i still was fascinated
by the whole idea this sounds mythical um this sounds like a fiction like harry potter or lord
of the rings or something like it could fit into that or i think of king arthur or some like slaying
of a dragon type thing because a lot of those things i'm like yeah yeah jesus no it went off and
didn't line up with jesus so he must be researching and looking at other stuff than just christianity
and maybe he didn't even really factor in christianity that much he did well he didn't include him in
the list but he did score other figures throughout and other cultures and so forth and none of them
got them all uh you know there wasn't i don't think any of them got everyone all the way down the line
to some of them only maybe half you know or less than that but nonetheless he picks up on some of
these and so uh he scored a variety of figures here's edipis thesius romulus herculeus persius
jason bellarophon helips eschlepius dianisus apollo zeus joseph moses elijah wattu yung
and he goes on and on so there's a variety but alan dune des that uh a more recent folklorist who
who i respect deeply has also included jesus to the score and jesus scores fairly well underdue
his uh his his analysis so it's it's it's just uh i don't think it's i i think it's more than
coincidence i think this he this is exactly correct that that these kinds of story patterns
recurred over and over again and again from from a literary kind of um linguistic signal
standpoint this is the way that that this kind of genre or storytelling would have helped people
get their heads around what type of story they were reading when they started to see these kinds
of motifs they were like okay yeah i kind of get it i know i know what we're getting into here
but but just to be clear though this happens it's interesting that this can happen across so many
different cultures and that's where you get carl young and the arctypes and and theorists trying
to say well maybe maybe in our mind we're just kind of pre-programmed to start creating these kinds
of story patterns in some way for even from birth so i i would i would go along with that now i wouldn't
necessarily do it in some esoteric way i would do it in a purely naturalistic one and maybe even a
physiological neurological scientific approach yeah and suggesting like we're wired literally we are
wired in our mother's womb to recognize space there's facial recognition systems cognitive
systems that are developing that help us know the face of our mother here our voice we listen we're
literally wired to listen to the voice and become prone to the mother's voice there's so many things
that we're work taught that come automatically and this brings me to rank raglan but also into the
dream thing before we get to the dream thing i want to make something that i have been fascinated
with about religion and why i think it happened okay why it happened period sure i feel like it's
like this this arm that grows from the the subconscious and the natural what we are you're
going to get into dream and why i think why do we watch tv why do we have this why do we have
past time why do we read right why do we have literature all that plays i think a part of
what you're going to get into but death if i think about why people have post-mortem appearances why
these legends build up uh-huh there it's so common any you can go to several doctors that'll tell you
the most common thing is that a loved one who died they still sense that they're there they sense
they're around so why wouldn't we embellish and create stories that come from a natural
yearning of our loved ones or what about ancestry worship why why why aren't we worshiping ancestors
they're still around even after they're gone in some way oftentimes people experience them so
that there's some science behind that that i would say rather than taking some ontological
esoteric approach or something to believing it i i think there's natural reason death birth
you get into dreams so anyway get into whatever take it where you want 1000 and you know when
we're all too human i don't know what i would go through if i was on the battlefield in the fox
hole if i was on the hospital bed with all the tubes hanging out if i was going through this
or that i do know that a friend of mine took his own life some years ago and uh i don't right now i'm
i'm a very naturalistic person i don't believe that you know in in anything i believe is not
part of how i you know construct my experience in the world but like three or four or five days
later i was out jogging one night and i could have swore this guy was kind of talking to me in my
head in some way and telling me that you know i because i was pissed off that he had done this
but found out that there were reasons and that those reasons probably i might have done the
same thing if i was in his shoes and so um won't want to get into that particular story but this
particular moment that i had was kind of an encounter with that that my brain this is my
neurological explanation had constructed that internally is almost an internal you know partition
voice in my head that was i was having dialogue with and it felt to me uh real and compelling
in some way i went home and i even had to sit down i was running i had to go to the park that
was nearby and just sit myself down because i was tearing up thinking about what what had
just gone on and um yeah so where do we find religion showing up in the most difficult
areas of our life i don't know if you've seen life of pie oh i love that great movie great
movie yeah and that's kind of the idea is there's sugar it's all a myth right it's all kind of an
analogy because they're trying to sugarcoat the harsh realities of life that this was you know
a boat with people cannibalism and people getting killed it was nasty and uh basically you end up with
my dog barking
so with life of pie you basically end up with uh you know sugarcoating the harsh realities of life
and and and and even it brings in at the very towards the end this idea that maybe what that's
what we're doing with the god idea and so the the pill is too hard to swallow for us humans and so
it's not surprising that you find religions in every culture it's not surprising that you find
these different kinds of problems taking place and being resolved by religion where do you find
religion you find it in births you find it in marriages you find it in um deaths you find it
in sickness you find it in animal sacrifice you find in these areas that are viscerally
either upsetting or just hard to process in terms of the major life events that a person might have
and so it's not surprising that we find also ubiquitous throughout different religions this
idea of transcending some of the most grievous limitations of the human experience death being
you know maybe the worst of all this is so good one comment then i want to get into this dream
thing and i'll bring it up but you can emphasize life of pie was amazing so if you haven't watched
the life of pie you need to i'm not kidding you at the end you you know you start to see
what in the world and i like how he phrased it i loved i loved the actors too the main actor
great movie crying in his eyes he was yeah so which one do you prefer and he's like the animals
and it was like the same as true of god yeah it was like it was like a sucker punch wasn't it
it was like boom boom yeah it was excellent it was a great movie and a great powerful point
i i wish i knew more about where that point came from i didn't do any that was just amazing it was
just an amazing way to express that well i think really that's the the punch line of the whole
movie really the the where he really nails it in as a naturalist yeah i'll tell you this i'm a
naturalist i i but i live with a narrative i do have a narrative in my head about my life and me
i have a i have an internal voice that i speak to myself and it was actually that voice i realized
that still small voice it was always me i thought it was god like i thought it was jesus and you
i'm sure i'm bringing it out of you brother hello so i'm gonna be all too human here i've
my more religious days back in my faith days a little bit it got absurd i that voice transformed
and i'm gonna give everyone's gonna criticize me as a madman but i'm gonna just be like this
little lay it all out there naked a little bit here you know jesus was helping me find parking
spots at target um helping me to select whether i should get a cheeseburger a hamburger that's
still small voice was guiding me through this and that whether i should you know helping me get my
parking spot more quickly so i could get my latte or whatever um you know and uh at some point it's
like okay and why isn't this master you know metaphysical supreme power doing something more
meaningful with is her time in this world right sounds like a human voice that's what i was trying
to do like oh i'm fussing over the parking spot that's me that's me that's me and right as i can
start to get involved in buddhism a little bit well guess what buddha had a lot the same voice
too is like okay whoa so that that voice uh and i began to realize okay this is a psychological
partition that i'm creating that in effect you could even control it yourself in some ways and
so there's an insanity in that that uh i think i need to call out so well i think we all have a
little bit but that's part of the why the wiring of the brain i think but i i realized that narrative
it was me is like the footprints in the sand i always describe and i go when you were down there
i carried you that's why you saw right it was me and and so i look back and do that and i thought
about dreams you said something different like interesting why would me and my wife or you and
your wife go and sit down and turn on a stand-up comedy show or watch tv well before we move on
from that last topic i do want to say something though this is this is the sincere people
need to be able to find this is a difficult life it's hard to be human really hard for most of us
and i have the most privileged life imaginable probably and i'm not having an easy right i can't
imagine how many other life you know the people that are going through this world some of them have
lives that i the incomprehensible that the the kind of demoralization and difficulty they have to
go through through this world and so the idea that we're constructing alternative narratives that
help us cope with that this is this is all too human and i have compassion for that i understand
that i get it i've been i've participated in it myself and so i just i don't want to dismiss
that as just something that this completely a joke but you know and i want to know i would
like to see grandma again of course who wouldn't you know i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if this wasn't
the end i mean when the ends i don't want to in i'd love to say there's something more i've said
this before i am one of those guys i'm thinking you mirror a lot of like on that but this isn't
dismissal of people believing and hoping and wishing we are coming to these conclusions not
in a mockery or a purposeful haha i just want to be a contrarian there's certain data there's
certain evidence that's drawing us to think that makes the most sense of our observations the world
the world is nil de grass tyson said it really quite well he said the universe is not meant to
make sense to us it's not made to make sense to us yes thank you and so like come to find out we
evolved what the heck like hold on you mean to tell me that humans weren't always humans that we
were some other creature what a revelation yeah that'll change your game because we the idea that
we were something else at some point in it in our timeline it is so and i'd propose to you that
that's a minor revelation that if we knew and i don't think it's within the human mind to know
ultimate reality or the the actual what's really going on here right i think that's beyond our brains
would short circuit immediately if we even began to get into that or we yeah we might not want to
right i think though that what i want to do though i think a lot of naturalists want to reduce the
world to this kind of mundane machinations of this heartless world and yes that's there but i
honestly also think though that if we knew the actual reality of what was going on here it would
blow our fucking minds it would be beyond what we can and it would make our our myths the things
that we tell each other to cope with this and that look like children's stories and they would be
silly by comparison and so the idea that that by having a naturalistic kind of perception or a
scientific idea of the world that that kind of reduces the world from being uh from its uh
i don't know mystery or charm or its uh you know wonder i just don't hold that view and so in that
sense i'm kind of like carl sagan or nil nil de grass tyson i see something wonderful there i see
i see a wonderful it may not be made for us to comfort us necessarily but that's no less
amazing and spellbinding and so that to me i love the scientific enterprise i love james
webb i love all the things that are going on right now in quantitative right now science is
moving at a pace that it's never moved before and the breakthroughs that we're going to see just in
our lifetime are going to be amazing and and that to me that's the pursuit of truth that's the human
pursuit of truth but yeah you were bringing up dreams and just to point out like you know it's
not it's no wonder we spend countless hours a day wanting to watch a tv show with our loved one wanting
to get immersed into a narrative and lost into a world i like video games um but i i like them but
i i don't ever get to play them like i want to so i'll watch tv shows with my wife because that's
at least something we can cooperate and find a way to meet in the middle on whereas nothing i'm
going to get real weird here for a second on camera nothing is more exciting to me than going
and finding out a new uh new fallout video game comes out right it's a post armageddon war game
where you're born in a underground vault you are raised by your mom and dad but your dad disappears
one day under tragic circumstances the alarms are going off and they said your father escaped the
vault now you have to go into this post apocalyptic world to find your father and find figure out why
but your mom died giving birth to you sorry your dad's the only one raising and then he disappears
leaves you in there you gotta go find him so you go into this world and you find this
post armageddon there's like literally radiation death through all this water stuff there's people
who are murdering people on the roads to steal their stuff and you're out here picking up anything
you can find will be a weapon to survive and you're i am this character in this game yeah yeah
i'm not me i'm an avatar now i am lost in this world it escaped reality i think that played a
part as to why i used drugs all those years there was a sense it numbed me from the scariness of
reality from from also the traumas of my life i'd live in the skin how i got from there to here
is a miracle to me i mean that's a naturalistic miracle how i was able to get there you know
but just weirding out for a second i i love that escape and you pointed out that there's no wonder
we dream and in just in the theory of dreams you bring this up in your book like i'm thinking
but it's resurrection and reception what the heck is that in early christian house i got anything to
do with this yeah it has a lot to do with just the whole cognitive understanding of humans and what
we do what why we do it yeah it really asks prior questions in some way what are we up to
if you unpack some of the most fundamental aspects of the human experience you think about laughter
or the idea of play or the idea of entertainment as soon as you get underneath some of these words
you start to realize there's a whole lot more going on here than what looks like on the surface
why do dogs play what are they up to well the same thing of why kids sort play
or you know why we might want to get into a video game and and and kind of immerse ourselves in an
alternative kind of world um this is entertaining to us in other words it's we are we're neurologically
wired to feel pleasure in this in this experience why it's rehearsing patterns that we valued in
in our deep psychology that help us towards survival that give us a sense of meaning that
help us be more connected with others to give us more urgency around different priorities
and the sort of thing it rehearses those psychologically and what's going on in dream well
in those other contexts like say watching a movie or a film when you're dreaming in those in those
contexts rather that's a controlled medium somebody's a producer there's actors or whatever that's a
context it's a video game there's programmers there's people writing all that what's going on
when you're dreaming well that's not a controlled environment per se at least not at a conscious
level but the same thing and so the most recent dream theory and i would get into that there in
the book basically says that we've been mistaken for all this time why why is it that we're rendered
vulnerable during the night for so many hours as a species what's the payoff there that's so
that gives us such an evolutionary advantage for doing so that's a pretty big toll
that we need to be unconscious for long periods of time while nocturnal animals are running all
over the place and other tribes are trying to attack us and whatever what's going on there
that the benefit of that process is outweighing the dangers and risks what's going on there we need
this right and so what they found is that while you're dreaming your synapses are rehearsing it
may seem like a jumbled mess like your brain is on rinse cycle with a couple of shoes and they're
tumbling around coming up with absolute nonsense but what's really going on there is it's rehearsing
certain synaptic patterns and grooves in your mind that it thinks based upon your experiences that
day and up to that point are going to better prepare you for the next day and so when you
don't have that quality of sleep the next day like they did some research with someone skiing
they got they went skiing one day that night dreamt may or may not have had skiing in their
mind as they were dreaming but then the next day they're going to ski better now if they if they
don't get that kind of sleep or whatever have that that next day to kind of process it and then go
for like a couple more nights their their their skiing ability isn't quite as good because they
didn't do that and so they're finding that because of quality of sleep and because of and so everybody
get their sleep because this is preparing you for the next day psychologically arming you up for
all the things you're going to the your your subconscious things you're going to be needing
to gear up for so that's an uncontrolled medium and sometimes some very interesting things you
know you might meet your parents you might be on the moon i've ridden a bicycle with like upside
down in the air and all kinds of stuff i've had many dreams of me floating and and this kind of thing
well what's going on there well that's what's going on is is it so in in that way my mind is
somehow preparing itself for there's something about that kind of a story that helps me to
better engage and to be better squared with the whatever i'm up against the next day and so
yeah thank you i hope you liked my dad richard miller in this interview remember to like and
subscribe and never forget we are miss vision
