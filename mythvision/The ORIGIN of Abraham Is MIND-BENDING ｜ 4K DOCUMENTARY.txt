We have found a document about the Spartans and the Jews indicating that we are related
and that both of our nations are descended from Abraham, 1 Maccabees 1221.
Dare we ask, did Abraham really exist?
The mysterious figure Abraham, embedded deep within the biblical narrative, conjures fascinating queries.
Might there be echoes of other myths that connect to the Abraham narrative?
Yes, echoes, and dare I say, myths.
If we're being audacious here, let's also claim that Abraham's tale might not be etched in the stone of history, but instead in the parchment of allegory.
We're on a quest for truth, and not just any truth, but one that doesn't sugarcoat our sensibilities.
Consider Peter J. Lightheart, a figure I may not always nod in agreement with, but who serves a cogent point as a voice of faith.
Evangelicals are debating the historicity of Adam, but they are too timid.
It is time to reject fundamentalist distortions of the Abrahamic narrative, just as decisively as we have abandoned literalistic readings of Genesis 1-3.
Clinging to discredited biblical accounts of Abraham is if these events actually happened, makes us look like Neanderthals.
It undermines the plausibility of our witness and ultimately overturns the Gospel.
To defend the Gospel and uphold the authority of the Bible, we need to reckon with the myth of Abraham.
Lightheart's clarity is akin to a refreshing splash of cold water, especially for someone like me, who navigates ancient texts with a secular compass, regardless of their cultural origins.
Yet, despite his insights, Lightheart still seems to hold the Bible as a divine artifact rather than a human creation.
The conundrum remains.
The tangible evidence for Abraham, let alone the events in Genesis, is as elusive as a desert mirage.
Take for instance Abraham's Sojourn in Egypte in Genesis 12.
Un cannoli reminiscent of Israel's Egyptian saga, which too seems more allegorical than actual.
Whether these narratives stem from shared literary motifs or direct modeling, the debate remains.
As scholars passionately debate these tales, origins, positing multiple authors across epochs, or perhaps a single Hellenic-influenced scribe, we must ponder if Abraham is less man and more motif.
What message lies encrypted in his story?
Our journey might find its compass pointing towards Greece.
Lorsque l'influence de cultures comme les Mesopotamiennes, Canaanites et l'Egyptie sur les textes bibliques est presque universelement annoncée,
le Grecian whisper dans la température de l'Egyptie est resté.
Mais je me suis convaincu de cette écho Hellenic.
Le grand Grec septuagent, interprété avec la tradition biblique, offre des clus tantalisés.
Les gens imaginent le Grecs comme des peuples polythéastes.
Mais les philosophes d'élites, comme Thélés, Socrates, Plato et Aristotle,
étaient les anciens gangsters du monisme, avec une puissance divine ultime qui roule sur les êtres blessures.
Le plus tard, les chrétiens et les Jus sont, dans de nombreux moyens, indépendants de ces pensées.
Et oui, pour ceux qui ont suivi nos explorations précédentes dans Russell Gamirkin's insights,
abaissez-vous pour une autre expédition scolaire,
dans Abraham's possible Grecian roots.
Join us as we wade into this confluence of Biblical Greek connections.
Let the Odyssey commence.
Abraham's story in a nutshell.
Born around 2170 BCE in the prominent city of Ur,
Abraham, later named Abraham, was a central figure in Biblical history.
Moving to Haran after the death of his brother Haran,
he married his half-sister Sarai at 75,
and he heated a divine call to relocate to Canaan.
Accompanied by Sarai and his nephew Lot,
his story opens up with the immediate promise of a land that God will show him,
and he will be a great nation.
Facing famine, they took refuge in Egypte,
where, fearing for their lives, Abraham presented Sarai as his sister,
afraid the Egyptians would kill him for her beauty.
Mind you, Sarai is ten years younger than Abraham according to these texts.
So here's a 65-year-old woman
who must have been smoking like a 20-year-old playboy model.
Odd detail.
Their deception was uncovered, leading to their expulsion.
Back in Canaan, tensions between Abraham and Lot's household forced them to part ways.
After Lot's capture in a regional war,
Abraham heroically rescued him,
and he bumped into Melchizedek, king of Salem,
who was a high priest of the Most High God.
Many questions abound for this figure.
In any ways,
around this period Abraham lamented his lack of an heir,
though God reassured him.
Sarai offered her maid, Hagar, to bear a child.
Hagar bore Ishmael, but tensions arose,
leading to her exile.
Can anyone say Jerry Springer any faster?
Later, God renewed his covenant,
renaming Abraham to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah,
foretelling the birth of Isaac and introducing circumcision.
Three divine visitors confirmed Isaac's upcoming birth,
and also warned of Sodom's impending destruction.
Despite Abraham's intercessions,
Sodom was destroyed,
though Lot escaped,
albeit the tragic consequences of his wife
turning into a pillar of salt.
Oh, and his two daughters,
drugging their father with wine
to sleep with him,
to carry on a seed.
In Gerar,
Abraham fearing for Sarah's safety again,
called her his sister.
King Abimelech took Sarah,
but returned her upon realizing the deceit.
Shortly thereafter,
Isaac was born.
Now who's the real baby's daddy here?
Abimelech or Abraham?
They vanished,
following more disputes,
involving Haagar and Ishmael.
Abraham banished them,
but they were divinely protected.
In a supreme test of faith,
God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac,
as Abraham obeyed,
an angel intervened,
providing a ram as a substitute.
Sarah passed away at the age of 137 years.
et Abraham s'est assuré d'un site baril dans Macphella.
Abraham s'est arrêté pour l'âge d'Isaac et avait plus d'enfants avec sa seconde-mère, Kattura.
En s'assurant que l'Isaac était son soleil, Abraham s'est passé à 175 ans
et s'est arrêté par Sarah, l'âge d'Isaac et l'Ishmael.
Éventuellement, son fils d'Isaac avait des enfants nommés Jacob et Esaac.
Puis Jacob avait les promesses et l'a été renommée à l'Israël.
L'israël, son préféré, était Joseph, qui les avait mis à l'Egypte.
Vous devez lire la histoire.
Et éventuellement, ils se seraient des slaves pour 430 ans.
Tout pour que Moses les aise à l'Exodus à l'âge de la promesse
avec Joshua, qui était en train de battre la victoire pour obtenir ce qu'il a promis Abraham à l'âge d'Isaac.
Le quest pour l'historique Abraham.
Le quest pour l'Abe.

Tomsen, John Vinceters, Russell Gamirkin, Philip Wajinbaum, Philip R. Davies et dare-I say, Neil Godfrey,
n'ont pas juste entré dans le fil des études de l'Otto Testament, ils ont dévoilé leurs fondations.
Tomsen et Cedars, dans les années 1970, en particulier, ont souhaité un consensus scolaire
de l'affirmation assurée de l'existence de l'Otto Patriarche à un skeptisme élevé,
suggérant la nature d'une question archéologique pour leurs restes.
Tomsen, Magnum Opus, l'historicité des narratives de l'Otto Patriarche,
s'améliquant à ce sentiment-là.
Donc, vite que ce soit le cible intellectuel, les spectateurs,
ce sera un ride cérébral.
Nous avons vu, dans la chacune d'une chacune, de la tradition récente de l'Abraham
de l'Otto du Chaldez, à Canine, par le nom de Chaldez, que ce n'est pas une tradition
originalement indépendante de l'Abraham.
Mais, c'est une reconstruction historiographique qui est basée sur plusieurs traditions
originalement indépendantes et conflites.
Si ce n'est pas le cas, il doit être compréhendé comme un historique historique.
Mais, aucun effort pour trouver des mouvements analogiques à l'Abraham
dans l'histoire de l'Otto du Chaldez sont essentiellement indépendants
pour les purposes de l'interprétation biblique.
Les intentions de les traditions bibliques de l'Otto Patriarche ne sont pas comparables
à ceux de l'historien moderne.
Ils sont plutôt sociologiques, politiques et religieux.
Ceux d'attemptes à l'interprétation de ces traditions, qui permettent de négocier
l'implication de leurs formations et de la structure, peuvent juste être détenus
comme un historisme.
Mais, on a vu que les chronologies bibliques ne sont pas fondées
sur l'histoire de l'Historique, mais sont plutôt basées sur un schéma
théologique très tard qui présuppose un worldview historique très historique.
Ces efforts pour utiliser les narratives bibliques pour une reconstruction
de l'histoire de l'Otto du Chaldez dans un manière comparable
à l'utilisation des archives de maris et de façons similaires
peuvent juste être détenus comme fondamentaux.
Mais, on a argumenté que les requêtes pour l'Abraham historique
sont basées sur une occupation fructueuse,
pour les historiens et les étudiants de l'Otto du Chaldez.
La question sur le background historique de les narratives patriarchales
est une question pour laquelle l'historique de l'Historique
avec l'aide de l'anglais de l'histoire de l'Otto du Chaldez
et de l'archéologie peuvent donner des réponses très concrètes.
En 1974, ce piece de rèdition était tellement scandaleuse
quand il s'est émergé que l'authors Thompson
a trouvé lui-même face à une vécuée longue
de l'employé.
En 1992, l'antique académique
a été créée pour une expérience uncérémonieuse
de Marquitte University de Hallow Halls.
De l'un des 70s infus des discos à l'air grunge de l'un des 90s,
il, au-delà de l'aide de Philippe R. Davies,
Niels Peter Lempsky et Keith W. Whitelam
étaient en bas et décodés à l'anigma élevé de l'Israël ancien.
Le travail n'était pas juste de la groundbreaking,
il était élevé,
spécialement dans le monde des études de l'Otto du Chaldez.
Mucho de son grand banterre,
la plupart de sa argumentation
était centrée sur les noms des patriarchues
comme Thompson dit dans son book de 1974.
Ce sera mon contention,
que le processus historique
est une erreur sérieuse
dans l'interprétation biblique
et, à l'extérieur,
que cela dépend de l'évidence
qu'on a de l'extérieur nomenclature.
Totalement infondé.
Certaines questions
doivent être demandées par l'évidence.
Est-ce que les noms
sont vraiment en train de démontrer
ou, probablement,
de l'historique des patriarchues?
Est-ce qu'ils ont aidé
d'aider la période
dans laquelle les patriarchues s'élèvent?
Est-ce qu'ils apportent la thèse
que l'historique de la génésie
est l'histoire de la seconde millennium,
spécialement les mouvements
des amérites?
Finalement, Thompson a dévoilé
la consensus sur l'historique d'Abraham.
La plupart des élèves
qui ont été critiqués
ont pour la raison de l'attente
de trouver l'Abe.
Si il n'y avait jamais un homme,
il a perdu à nous
que c'est son fils,
tout le monde de Moses.
Si il n'y avait jamais un Exodus,
il n'y avait absolument rien
comme le Bible le dit.
La même chose peut être dit
sur le monarchie unité
avec King David et Solomon.
Le plus l'on le dit,
le plus scandaleux
il semble que le Bible
n'est pas historiquement accurate.
Mais est-ce que les autorités
sont en train de
convaincre leurs élus
et les héros
d'une histoire faite
comme Plato l'a recommandé
dans ses writings?
Russell Gamirkin a parlé
plusieurs fois
sur les lieux nobles de Plato
et comment créer
une grande nation.
Dans la pursuit historique
de les patriarches bibliques,
beaucoup de scolaires
équipent avec
les tools archéologiques
et la scripture
ont été créés
une confirmation empirique
de ces figures iconiques.
Dans l'Egypte,
l'un est présenté
avec les names
du début de l'immédiate période
2181 à 2055 BCE
associé à Abraham
et est venu d'être amérite.
Cette association
arrive parce que
de la ressemblance phonétique
à l'Amour
du sud de Mesopotamie
émergée par la même époque.
Parallèlement,
les Hyksos,
liés à Jacob et Joseph,
sont percevés
comme invaders
avec l'améritage amérite.
Curiously,
c'est la nomenclature
de ces patriarches
qui semblent connecter
ces dotes historiques
permettant aux scolaires
d'interpréter ces tales
comme l'histoire condensée
de l'île de l'Egypte
durant le 2e millennium.
Thompson's scholarship
indique
que ces names patriarchales
n'étaient pas exclusives
à l'Inde millennium BCE
mais sont écoutées
dans le 4e siècle BCE
à travers des lois diverses
including Mesopotamie.
L'existence de Abraham
a souvent été posée
sur les éléments corroboratifs
comme les références géographiques
en Genesis.
Mais
c'est essentiel
de noter
que ces places
ont été endurées
bien dans l'époque de l'Egypte.
Thompson l'interpréte
dans la signification
de Abraham's names
dans ce contexte.
Je profite d'une contention.
Quand la fondation d'une
histoire foundationnelle
est probable
que les autorités
pourraient rééjecter
leurs figures primaires
dans des décisions antiquées
et de l'authenticité
de la vénère.
Par exemple,
l'archéologiste estime
Israël Finkelstein
a vu la narration biblique
de Canaan's conquest
en Joshua
en moins d'un compte historique
authentique
et plus
d'un blueprint idéologique
du 7e siècle BCE
en dépitant un conquest
inspirationnel
sous King Josiah
de Judah.
Finkelstein hypothesise
que cette narrative
a peut-être originé
dans l'Israël's
nord-en-kingdom
à l'arrivée du 8e siècle BCE
inspirée par
les remnants
de l'avenir.
Cette perspective
augmente l'église
considérant
la faillite d'archéologiques
pour beaucoup de cités
ou des émergences
seulement dans
le 8e et le 7e siècle BCE.
Comment peut-on
valider un conquest
du 12e siècle BCE
des villes
qui, archéologiquement,
appuient
à l'avenir
un millenium plus tard?
Par cette logique,
l'absence de l'évidence
pour les excédés
de Moses
de l'Egypte
pourrait être
attribuée
à les bêtes celestiaux
équipées
avec des bêtes de la douleur.
Ces narratives
sont probablement
empêlées
des rétellings
de créations
législatives
souvent
dans les nuances contemporaines
en réveillant
leur true
temporelle origin.
Pour établir
l'analyse
de découvrir un gospel
où Peter cruise
dans la Honda-Civic,
il serait unmistakable
d'être
un narratif
créé
dans un plus
moderne mille-eux.
Similare,
le génécien
contient des anachronismes
qui pointent
à l'avenir
l'historique
de l'historique
punintent.
...
Dans nos explorations
de vidéo
nous avons tourné
par les tapestries
de mythes et de l'or
sous le genou de Genesis
1-11.
Maintenant,
comme nous nous le dévouons
dans les tales
de Abraham,
il y a un sentiment
prévélant
que nous avons encarré
nous-mêmes
dans le fond de l'historique
de l'historique.
Des commentaires
s'inscrivent
cette démarcation
qui suggère
une transition
de mythes
à la réalité
entre
Genesis 11
et 12.
Pour certains scholars,
cette transformation
commencée
même plus tard
avec Genesis 11-10
en avancant
les terrains
et l'expédition
de l'Eur
à l'Iran
dans l'Histoire.
En temps,
j'ai développé
une certaine affinité
pour ceux qui
interprètent
ces passages
comme des narratives
masterful
plutôt que
l'Histoire concrète.
Cela naturellement
accueillit
l'équipe.
Quand est-ce que
Genesis s'est inscrit ?
Une portion
significative de la communauté
scolaire
posée
sa création
durant l'exile
ou peut-être
l'époque post-exile
avec un handful
de bêtes
sur la période persienne.
C'est par le point de note
que leur perspective
primairement
tient
sur la source persienne
même si pas tous contendent
que
Genesis
dans sa entière
s'est émergée
durant ces temps.
Aujourd'hui,
j'ai aimé
éliminer
les shades
de l'Hellenistique
qui ont été
sur le Genesis.

dans les concepts
qui ont parfois
pris un temps
pour éliminer
les cercles
américains.
La note particulière
est de son discours
sur Nils-Peter Lemke
qui j'ai trouvé
être intellectuellement
stimulé.
Il y a des points
en faveur
de date
de l'Hellenistique
après 300 BCE
pour l'Otto Testament.
N°1
c'est un fact
que l'histoire de l'Israël
comme dit l'Otto Testament
n'a pas beaucoup
de choses à faire
avec les développements historiques
en Palestine
jusqu'à la fin de la partie
de la monarchie.
N°2
une partie extensible
de cette littérature
devrait être considérée
la création
de la Diaspora juive.
D'abord et foremost
les narratives patriarchales
la histoire du Exodus
sur les Israéliens en Égypte
et leur escape
de l'Égypte.
Mais aussi les narratives
de la conquête
en Joshua.
Toutes ces rêves
sont les mêmes
issues.
À plus ou plus
d'une idée utopique
qu'une majorité juive
même l'Empire
devrait être
réestablée
ou réestablée
en Palestine.
Une idée
qui s'est émergée
en spite du fact
qu'il n'y avait pas de background
en l'Empire israélien.
N°3
les writers
qui inventaient
l'histoire de l'Israël
semblent
ont modelé leur histoire
sur une pattern grecque.
Les Herodotistes
qui sont les plus anciens points
de comparaison
il y a un nombre
de similarities
entre les histoires
des Herodotistes
et l'Old Testament.
Les histoires
ont, comme au début,
une perspective
qui encompasse
le monde entier
comme ça
et cette perspective
s'arrête
dans un seul pays
seulement à un point plus tard.
Respectivement,
le grec
et le héberu
les histoires bibliques
dédièrent
l'knowledge
de la tradition grecque
et cela pourrait
hardly
have been the case
before Greek historians
were to become
known
and read
in the Near East.
N°4
le période persian
does not seem
to fit the requirements
of being the time
when the historical books
of the Old Testament
were written down.
First of all,
it would have to be proved
that Greek authors
were known
and extensively read
in the Persian Empire
and I very much doubt
that this was the case.
Lemke goes into far more responses
to this issue
of a later dating
of the Old Testament,
but consider it
as we dive deeper
into this documentary.
Philippe R. Davies
an esteemed professor
of biblical studies
at the University of Sheffield
delves deeply into these matters.
His assertions
have sparked fervent debates
within academic corridors.
Davies contends,
based on archaeological evidence
and rigorous analysis
of the biblical narrative,
that the biblical Israel
is more myth
than reality.
He posits that figures
such as Abraham and Moses
are not historical entities
and kingdoms attributed
to David and Solomon
did not exist as described.
According to Davies,
the biblical depiction of Israel
might have been crafted
as late as the Persian era,
challenging traditional chronologies.
Problems with dating
the Old Testament
to the Persian era.
We have very little information
about the Jewish population
in the Persian era.
We have almost nothing
apart from the books
of Ezra and Nehemiah
and the historicity
of these books
has also come under scrutiny.
Sommed out, there was ever
even a mission by Ezra.
The autobiography of Nehemiah
may be no more historical
than many other similar examples
of autobiographical genre
in the Greek world.
Biblical historians
have traditionally written
of the period of Persian rule
as time of peace and prosperity.
Judah was allowed
administrative independence.
Jerusalem was organized
as a prosperous
Temple Burger Society.
But the evidence we have
could just as easily be interpreted otherwise.
That Judah's independence
may be more comparable
to modern crumbling societies
left on their own
and with a great deal
of administrative independence
to provide a sad picture
of local incompetence.
Maybe they did not interfere
in local affairs
because they did not care.
The Temple Burger Society
has nothing more
than hypotheses to support it.
And the account of a band
of Greek mercenaries
being able to waltz
through the empire
kill a Persian governor
and walk out again
in Xenophon's Anabasis
is evidence
of Persian administrative
incompetence.
The archeological evidence
we need for the Persian period
is not likely to come to light.
Israeli archeologists
have demonstrated a contempt
for the Persian period
and removed its remains
to rubbish dumps
in order to get down
to the real Israelite layers.
Lemke cites
A. Mazar's archeology
of the land of the Bible
586 BCE
as illustrative
to this attitude.
As for the Hellenistic period,
it should never be forgotten
that the revitalization
of the ancient Near East
only became a fact
after the Greek takeover.
It is an established fact
that city life vastly expanded
after the conquest of Alexander.
Here we must realize
what happened in Jerusalem
and in Palestine.
Innovations that were comparable,
although on a smaller scale,
to the cultural developments
in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt.
Scholars may nurse
very romantic ideas
about what may have happened
in the nooks and crannies
of pre-Hellenistic Palestine
in a society
considerably poorer
than the one found there.
For example,
during the Late Bronze Age,
a more worldly and realistic assessment
of facts suggest
that the Persian period
was not the time
when the Old Testament
could have been written down.
Hardly any parallel
exists to such a development,
but a lot of evidence
that says the Hellenistic age
was the formative period
of early Jewish thought
and literature
as witnessed by the Old Testament itself.
I would refer everyone
to Yonatan Adler,
the archaeologist,
who is confirming
much of these statements.
In Plato
and the creation of the Hebrew Bible,
Russell Gamirkin
delves into an intriguing premise.
He postulates
that a myriad of laws
within the Hebrew Bible
draw parallels
more closely to the works of Plato
rather than the traditions
of the ancient Near East.
Both Gamirkin and Philip Wajenbaum
theorize that Plato's
philosophical treaties
were seminal influences
shaping the biblical authors'
formulation of idealistic national laws.
Russell Gamirkin
on Foundation Stories.
When we look at Greek literature,
we can see that the biblical tells
of the Israelites' Exodus
under Moses and their conquest
under Joshua
are quite similar
to the Greek Foundation Stories.
Even though this kind of storytelling
wasn't common in the ancient Near East,
it was very popular among the Greeks
during the Hellenistic period.
This section delves
into the common themes
in Greek Foundation Stories
and how they compare to Moses
leading the Israelites to the Promised Land.
Greek Foundation Stories
can be set in different eras.
There are mythical times,
that's when gods and humans
lived together before major floods
like that of Du Callion
or Noah.
There's legendary times
marked by heroes
and ending around the Trojan War
and the more factual, archaic
and historical periods.
Direct interactions
between gods and humans
were limited to the mythical
and legendary periods.
In later times,
people would seek advice or guidance
from the gods at temples
or sacred sites.
While some stories
were entirely set in legendary times,
most foundation tales
started with the promises of land
made during this era.
But the actual settlement
happened in the more factual,
archaic or historical periods.
Promises of ancestral lands
are a recurring theme
in many Greek Foundation Tales.
They serve as a foundational myth
that supports later conquests
and settlements of specific territories.
Often, these promises were made
to renowned heroes like Heracles,
Aeneas
or members of the Argonaut expedition.
As these heroes journeyed,
they would pass through territories
that their descendants would eventually settle.
Often, gods like Apollo
would grant these lands to the heroes
during their travels.
Even if the heroes settled elsewhere
or even passed away in a different land,
their divine claim to these lands
would be handed down to their descendants.
It might take several generations
before the descendants actually settled
these promised lands.
A famous example of this narrative theme
is Heraclius' Adventures,
where he received divine rights
to various places
during his Mediterranean travels.
This narrative style was also used
to justify the Spartans' colonization efforts,
citing Heracles' journeys.
Another example is the story
of Cyrene in North Africa.
As per the accounts of poets Pindar
and Apollonius of Rhodes,
when the Argonauts arrived at the Libyan coast,
Poseidon's son gave Euphemus
a symbolic chunk of Libyan soil,
marking it as a territory under his rule.
This token of rulership was passed down
until Batas, a descendant founded Cyrene in Libya.
Another special case is Aeneas,
who after the Trojan War, journeyed the Mediterranean
but never visited Latium's promised land.
However, he was prophesied at Troy
that his descendants would create a city,
Rome, destined for greatness.
Drawing parallels,
Winefield highlighted the similarities
between the land promises
given to the biblical figures
like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and those given to heroes like Heracles and Aeneas.
The stories of these patriarchs
served as a prelude to the foundation
of the Israelite nation by Moses and Joshua.
Similarly, Greek tells about ancient heroes
and foundational ancestors
provided a historical context
for subsequent movements and conquests.
The Israelite's journey
and settlement into the promised land
mirrors Greek myths like the return of the Heracles,
usually foundation stories,
which explain how a group settled in a new territory,
begin by detailing the problems
that made them leave their original home.
These issues could be overpopulation, famine,
disease outbreaks, natural disasters,
economic problems, internal conflicts,
forced exile,
military defeats,
or escaping potential conquests
and enslavement.
In one ancient Jewish story
written by Hecateus of Abdera,
around 315 BCE,
it's said that Egypt became overpopulated,
leading the Egyptians to send settlers
to places including Babylon and Judea.
Another tale from Manito,
written around 285 BCE,
claims that Jerusalem and Judea
were first inhabited by the Hyksos,
foreign rulers who took over Egypt
but were later forced out by the Egyptians
due to a disease outbreak
linked to the Hyksos's ungodly practices.
In contraste, the biblical Exodus story
written around 270 BCE
presents a different viewpoint.
The Egyptians faced plagues
as punishment for enslaving the Israelites
and only after suffering these calamities
did the pharaoh let them go.
This narrative of escaping from bondage
fits the pattern of Hellenistic foundation stories
and is a consistent theme in biblical tales.
The well-known practice of the Egyptians
using slave labor for grand projects
such as building pyramids reinforces this narrative.
While the miraculous rescue of the Israelites
is unique to the biblical account,
their quest for freedom aligns well with Greek tales.
A pivotal moment in the Exodus story
is when God chooses Moses to be the liberator
and guide for the Jewish people.
This revelation occurs when Moses,
in exile from Egypt,
discovers a holy site in the Sinai Desert.
God informs him that he has been chosen
to lead the Israelites out of Egypt
to a new homeland with Aaron's assistance.
Although hesitant and unsure,
Moses accepts this significant responsibility.
In the biblical story,
Moses' divine selection
to lead mirrored a common trend
seen in Greek foundation tales.
Typically in these tales, an oracle,
usually at the famed Delphi Sanctuary
dedicated to Apollo,
would choose the leader termed Oikist
for a colonization mission.
This Oikist held various roles,
expedition head, military leader,
spiritual guide, and law enforcer.
It was a reoccurring theme
for these leaders to be unexpectedly chosen.
Guidance for their journey,
including specific landmarks
and signs to determine settlement areas,
often came from the Delphi oracle.
On some journeys,
a prophet or spiritual guide accompanying the leader,
aiding in establishing the new settlement.
The biblical account showcases
the Israelites as an organized armed group,
constantly prepared for battle
as they journeyed from Egypt.
Moses was their military strategist,
but their triumphs,
whether in battle against various tribes
or major exodus from Egypt,
were attributed to the divine intervention of Yahweh.
This description of the exodus
sets the stage for the next phase,
the conquest where Joshua
takes over Moses' military role.
Throughout these narratives,
the main emphasis is on the armed men.
Women, children, and livestock
are seen as under their protection
while the fighters are the focus of accounts
and are explicitly numbered.
The portrayal of this migration, then,
is of an armed group transitioning
from one territory to conquer another.
This depiction aligns with Greek tales
where colonization parties
often journeyed as armed contingents.
It's at Delphi
that Apollo recognized
as the god guiding migrations and settlements
were consulter.
In the Bible, Mount Sinai serves as the pivotal spot
where God communicates with Moses.
This return to Sinai in the Exodus narrative
is the backdrop for the profound moment
where Moses climbs the mountain
and receives God's commandments.
In Greek tales,
the leader often revisits the Delphi oracle
for advice on pressing issues.
This trip back to the oracle
sometimes left the expedition group alone
for extended times.
Akin to Moses' 40-day stay on the mountain.
Moses, as the law giver,
fits seamlessly within the Greek narrative structure.
In Greek tales, the Oikist
typically established laws for the new settlement.
Historical accounts and legends
often credit ancient law codes
to singular prominent figures
such as Lycurgus or Solon
who sometimes were believed
to have received these laws directly from deities.
Established processes even allowed
for proposed law codes to be presented at an oracle
like Delphi to gain divine approval.
While Greek narratives often depict law givers
getting divine laws
via specific ceremonial methods,
the Bible portrays Moses
directly meeting God at Sinai
amid an awe-inspiring natural display.
At Mount Sinai, Moses supervised
the creation of a special tent and its items.
This tent wasn't just a place of worship
but was believed to be the dwelling place of God.
As the Israelites traveled through the wilderness,
God was thought to accompany them within this tent.
Moses was the main spiritual leader
for the Israelites during their journey
much like the Oikist in Greek stories.
The Oikist was also a religious leader
representing the God Apollo
during their colonization missions.
When the Greeks ventured into new territories,
they believed they were also relocating their gods.
A sacred fire symbolized this move
which they used for religious rituals during the journey.
Apollo's famous sanctuary in Delphi
often gave them guidance
on where to settle and build their new sanctuaries.
In the Bible, before entering their desired land,
the Israelites sent scouts to check it out.
However, they were disheartened
by the challenges they'd face in conquering it.
As a result, they spent 40 years wandering
during which the entire soldier generation died.
Similarly, in some Greek tales,
explorers were sent first to assess new lands.
These colonization efforts,
whether in myth or real history,
often faced challenges.
They might take much longer than expected,
sometimes spending several generations.
There were times when the settlers
even thought of going back to their original homeland
due to homesickness or settlement challenges.
Both the biblical account and Greek tales
emphasized the importance
of establishing foundational laws
and systems for their new societies.
For Israelites, after their 40-year journey,
there was a renewed emphasis on the laws,
particularly in the Book of Deuteronomy.
This highlighted how they should live once they settled.
All these guidelines were officially approved
by the community and were meant
to be publicly displayed in their new homeland.
Similarly, when Joshua took the people across the Jordan,
he quickly set up an altar
and inscribed these laws
ensuring they were practiced.
Like in the Bible,
Greek colonization stories
also focused on establishing foundational laws
for their new territories.
The leader or Oikist,
who was similar to Moses, set these laws.
The Oikist laid down rules
about political, religious, and military structures.
The society's class system,
land distribution, and citizens' rights.
Just as in the biblical narrative,
these laws were approved by the community,
usually with rituals and oaths.
Often, these guidelines were inscribed
on stone tablets for everyone to see.
When the Israelites reached the Promised Land,
they were coming back
to the original home of their ancestors,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
This story reminds us
of the return of the Heraclids in Greek tales.
In both stories,
a divine command encouraged the takeover
of the local people.
Similarly, the journey of Joshua
in conquering part of the Promised Land
matches Greek stories
about the founding of new colonies.
In both the Bible and Greek tales,
the deity presents the land as a gift.
The conquering colonizers believed
qu'ils n'étaient pas juste allés,
mais qu'ils étaient obligés d'enlever.
La plupart du temps,
les gens natifs n'étaient pas déçus
et que l'on s'est emplacés
ou qu'on allait bouger.
Parfois, le takeover était expliqué
avec une raison morale,
ajoutant à la légende.
Le Oikist, ou le leader de la colonie,
a souvent été un héros réveillé
grâce à sa leadership militaire,
mais la colonie n'était pas toujours smooth.
Les Newcomers ont souvent fait des challenges
des locales,
qui ont parfois fait que les Grés
pensent ou donnent leurs plans.
Juste comme les Grés se sentent chiant
pour ne pas prendre les lands
mis en place par leur Dieu Apollo,
l'Oracle.
Les Israéliens étaient aussi critisés
dans le Bloc de les Judges
pour ne pas complètement conquérir
leur Promised Land.
Le Oikist a eu plusieurs responsabilités,
incluant la main-de-bloc de la main-de-bloc,
créant des zones religieuses
et des structures,
organiser les festivals
et diviser le land entre les settlers.
Les actions de Joshua pendant la phase de la conquête
baignent beaucoup de similaires
aux accounts de colonisation grecques
en détail par Weinfeld.
Lorsque la colonie a été établie,
sa complication était marquée
par la mort de sa figure fondée.
Les générations plus tardes
comprenaient ce fondateur
et ont souvent détaillé
une speciale colt
pour les honorer,
généralement sur leur site barriol.
Pour la colonie qui s'est établie
dans les temps historiques,
ces sites barriol
étaient typiquement
dans l'arrière centrale de la ville.
Dans les tales légendaires,
la location exacte de la barriole
pourrait être perdue en temps.
Lorsque Moses' place barriole
reste une mystérie,
les sites barrioles
de Joshua et le Président
de l'Easar
ont été élevés
et ont suggéré
que ces fondateurs
étaient profondément respectés.
La tradition de l'Oikist
a souvent évolué
la célébration d'une année
qui m'a rappelé
la fondation de la colonie
sous la leadership de l'Oikist.
L'une des les plus fameux
de ces célébrations
était le Daurian's
Carnéa Festival,
l'honneur des détenus
de Sparta,
Thera et Cyrene.
La Carnéa
était initialement
un festival
qui s'est célébré
en payant le tribut
de Carnus,
un god d'olde rame.
L'an dernier,
ce god a été associé
avec l'Apollo.
L'Apollo Carnéus
signifie
l'Apollo
comme le guide de la migration.
Much comme
l'Apollo Carnéa
lead le bloc,
l'aspect particulier
de l'Apollo

Le Festival Carnéa
les 9 jours
ont eu
plusieurs activités
comme le sacrifice
d'un rame
et une récréation
d'un voyage militaire
qui inclut
les danseurs

et des parades

Intéressant,
l'aspect de la Carnéa
a des similaires
avec le passif biblique

Les deux ont commencé
comme des festivals

En temps,
ces festivals

Le passif
dans sa évolution
protégeait

à ce que la Carnéa

Philippe
Wajinbaum
en 2008
a
défendu
l'anthropologie
doctorale
d'Argonautes
du dessert.
Analyse structurelle
de la Bible
de l'Église.
Il
applique
l'analyse structurelle
de la Bible
de Levi
Strauss.
L'analyse
de Levi Strauss
n'est jamais
nommé
dans l'un d'entre eux.
In Wajinbaum's words,
for Levi Strauss,
a version of a myth
is always derived
from
an existing
adaptation
originating
most of the time
from a different
culture and language.
A myth must always
be
within the same cultural area, where contacts between populations are proven.
Wajinbaum is analyzing the Bible narratives as myths,
though he concedes they may contain some historical elements
and comparing the accounts with narratives and laws from Greek literature.
While ancient Near Eastern literature offers many laws similar to those in the Bible,
he thinks the Greek literature has not been explored in this context to its full potential.
I am already wondering about the gospel narratives and the relationship between Jewish and Greek mythical
and literary culture in this context, Godfrey says.
For Levi's Strauss, similarities between myth that may appear as coincidental at first look
must be investigated more deeply.
This investigation may ultimately reveal that the analyzed narratives are actually variants of the same myth.
Levi's Strauss builds a very strong case for his arguments in his analysis of Native American myths.
The story of the bird nester can be found in hundreds of different variants in every part of both South and North America,
proving the same initial story spread itself through millennia of oral diffusion.
Levi's Strauss describes how that the order of the episodes of a myth
can be reversed from one variant to another and that many motifs can be inverted.
Levi's Strauss sought to discover universal rules of transformation in all mythes
similar to the discovery of universal principles in structural linguistics and phonology.
The aim of Levi's Strauss was to show that mankind thinks everywhere the same.
But there is no objective distinction between so-called primitive and civilized thoughts.
Parallelism is not a dirty word like the proverbial hammer
that cares not whether it is used to build a house or bash the skull of a prisoner.
Analyzing parallels can serve valid and good and invalid and bad functions.
Parallelisms must not be analyzed in an isolated way,
but one must try to find out a possible narrative structure that links the similarities together.
In other words, the similarity is not sufficient by itself to speculate about any possible borrow.
We must examine the place and role of these in their own contexts.
Frixus and Isaac under the microscope. Godfrey continues.
So with the context of the methods of Levi's Strauss in mind, no one will jump to the conclusion
that the well-known parallelism between the Greek myth of Frixus
and the binding of Isaac indicates a source-derivative relationship.
What will be needed after examining the parallels is an examination of the place
and role of these stories in their own contexts.
That step will probably have to wait for the next post, Godfrey says.
Here is the Frixus myth in, hopefully, a quick, easy-to-read ladder
with a crucial key noted in step 10.
1.
Athamas, King of Biosha, married Nepheli,
a cloud goddess created in the image of Hera by Zeus.
2.
Athamas and Nepheli had twin children,
a son, Frixus, and a daughter, Heli.
3.
Athamos afterwards rejected Nepheli and married Eno.
4.
Eno hated her step-children, Frixus, and Heli,
so plotted to have them killed by their own father.
5.
Eno bribed messengers who told King Athamas
that the Oracle of Delphi, speaking for the god Apollo,
required the sacrifice of Frixus on Mount Leficien
in order to end a famine in Biosha.
6.
Juste as Athamas was about to sacrifice his son Frixus,
Zeus, or Nepheli in other versions,
sent a golden-winged ram to rescue Frixus
and Heli by flying away with them.
7.
Heli fell off hence the hell's-punt, Heli's sea.
8.
The ram brought Frixus safely to Colchis, Georgia.
9.
In gratitude, Frixus sacrificed to Zeus the golden ram that saved him
and hung its golden fleece on an oak tree.
10.
Now while it may seem quite inconsequential,
probably the most important ingredient of this myth
is that it is the prologue of the Epic of the Argonauts
who will come to Colchis years later to bring the famous
golden fleece back to Greece.
The significance of this will become apparent in my next post
where I begin to compare the structured context
of this myth and the binding of Isaac.
We can recognize the resemblance to the binding of Isaac in Genesis 22.
To test the faith of Abraham, God orders him to sacrifice his only beloved son
on Mount Moriah.
Abraham submits to the command and binds his son.
At the last moment, God sends an angel and interrupts the sacrifice.
Abraham sees a ram stuck in a bush and sacrifices that ram
instead of his son.
But note the inversion of one small detail.
In the Greek version, the ram is killed first.
Then its fleece is hung in a tree.
Whereas in the biblical version, the ram is first stuck in a bush
and sacrificed afterwards.
This inversion of detail can lead us to wonder whether these stories
could both derive from a common source.
One could derive from the other or that the resemblance is only due to
the coincidence.
Therefore, we must examine the place and role of these stories
in their own contexts, respectively, the Epic of the Argonauts
and the biblical narrative.
Godfrey continues in another blog with his astute observations.
See Godfrey's comparisons here.
One, you've got this divine command to sacrifice one son.
It's real in the case of Isaac.
A lie in another in the case of Frixus.
Frixus' stepmother bribed messengers to tell the father that God
required the sacrifice.
One, the father's pious unquestionning submission to the command.
Two, the last minute deliverance of the human victim by a divinely
sent ram, direct command to the father in the case of Isaac, direct
command to the sacrificial victim in the case of Frixus.
Three, the fastening of the ram in a tree or bush.
Before the sacrifice of the ram in the case of Isaac, after the
sacrifice of the ram in the case of Frixus.
Four, the sacrifice of the ram.
As a substitute for Isaac.
As a Thanksgiving for Frixus.
What is significant is that these narrative units in common to both
stories exist at a level independent of the particular stories.
They can be inverted, reordered to create different stories.
The question to ask is, are these units similar by coincidence
or has one set been borrowed from the other?
That particular detail about the ram in the tree or thicket is
certainly distinctive enough to justify this question in relation to
the whole set.
Firstly, given that it is no longer considered quote unquote fringe,
except maybe among a large portion of American biblical scholars
where the influence of conservative and even evangelical religion is
relatively strong to consider the Bible's quote unquote old
testament books being written as late as the Persian or even
Hellenistic eras.
And given the proximity of Jewish and Greek cultures, the possibility
of direct borrowing cannot be rejected out of hand.
Secondly, the chances of the Jewish story of the binding of Isaac
being influenced by Greek myth is increased if both stories are
located in a similar structural position within parallel narratives.
Both near human sacrifice narratives serve as the prologues to larger
tales of one divine promises of a land to be inherited by a hero's
descendants, to a special divinely chosen people, three, a prearranged
time schedule of four generations before the land would be inherited,
four, deliverance through a leader who initially protested
because he stutters, five, an additional delay because of human
failure to hold fast to a divine promise, six, a wandering
through desert with a sacred vessel, seven, guiding divine
revelations along the way.
Not only are both tales of escape from human sacrifice prologues
to these larger comparative narratives, but they also serve
as a reference point in both.
They hold the respective larger stories together by serving as the
origin point of the divine promises that guide the subsequent
narratives of journeying to a promised land.
And that origin point is referenced by way of reminder throughout
the subsequent narratives.
The biblical narrative is about much more than the way the children
of Abraham inherited the land of Canaan.
And here is where Philip Wajibam, in his 2008 doctoral thesis
Argonauts of the Desert, structural analysis of the Hebrew Bible,
draws attention to the extensive similarities between Plato's
writings and the Bible's narratives.
Both contain a general flood being the beginning of a new era in
civilization with a patriarchal age following the rise of cities
and kingship and the development of Laws and a description of
an ideal state.
The Laws and the Pentateuch are often remarkably alike the Laws
proposed by Plato.
You've got Laws that require a central religious authority.
You have Laws of a need for pure bloodlines, especially for priests.
Laws that condemn homosexuality, witchcraft, magic.
Laws of inheritance, boundary stones.
Laws of allowing slaves to be taken from foreign peoples only.
Laws against the need for a king.
Laws governing involuntary homicide.
Laws regarding rebellious children.
Laws against usury, against taking too much fruit from one's
fields.
And quite a few more and often found listed in the same order
between the Greek and Hebrew texts.
The ideal state, moreover, is divided into 12 lots of land given to
12 tribes.
The king, it is warned, is subject to the vices of love and this
will lead to oppressive tyranny.
One might think here of the sins of David and Solomon.
Wajinbaum applies the structural analysis of myths as developed by
Claude Levi-Strauss, the Bible, and one can see his coverage is much
more extensive than can be covered in a few blog posts.
Here is where Godfrey is focusing, only on structural place of the
Frixis, Isaac's sacrifices and their respective wider narratives.
The Frixis episode serves as an introduction to the adventures of
Jason and the Argonauts.
And this set of adventures functions as an explanation of the founding
of the Greek colony of Cyrene in North Africa, Libya.
The Argonaut Epic and the Bible Narrative, Neil Godfrey, earlier
written a series of six posts on the resonances between the Argonautica
as told by Apollonius of Rhodes.
They are found by starting at the bottom of this Argonautica archive,
but this post is addressing Wajinbaum's thesis.
The full Argonaut Epic is found in Pindar's 4th Pythian, Ode.
It had earlier been referenced in Homer's Odyssey, book 12, 69-72,
and Hesiod's Theogony, 990-1005, and in Herodotus, the foundation of Cyrene
and the interrupted sacrifice of Frixis.
Euripides wrote two plays titled Frixos, now lost to us.
And of course, Apollonius of Rhodes wrote the epic poem in imitation
of Homer, the Argonautica.
The main sources for this Epic relate it to the founding of Cyrene.
Pindar's Ode is even dedicated to the King of Cyrene.
This compares with the early Bible Narrative from Abraham to Moses,
relating to the settling of Canaan.
Jason, leader of the Argonauts, belonged to the same extended family as Frixis,
all being descended from Aeolus.
Zeus was angry with the descendants of Aeolus over the attempted sacrifice of Frixis by his father.
And to appease his divine wrath, Jason embarked in the Argo with a band of followers,
the Argonauts, to retrieve the Golden Fleece.
This was the fleece of the ram that had saved Frixis at the last moment from being sacrificed.
Triton's son of the sea god Poseidon appeared in human form
and gave one of the Argonauts, Euphemus, a gift of a handful of Libyan soil,
as a token of a promise that his descendants would return and colonize the land.
Had Euphemus succeeded in keeping the soil to plant appropriately in his own home area,
his descendants would have returned to colonize only four generations later.
But since the soil was washed overboard and its particles landed on the island of Thera,
instead, 17 generations would have to pass
and Cyrene would have to be colonized by the descendants of the Argonauts
after first settling in Thera.
This is the reverse of the order in which we read of the sacrifice
and the promise in the biblical narrative.
There Abraham has promised the land and afterward
prepares to sacrifice Isaac.
The Argonauts seek to appease Zeus's anger of the attempted sacrifice of Frixis
by retrieving the fleece of the ram that saved him
and the promise of the land of Cyrene for the descendants of the Argonauts is made afterwards.
Generations later, after the descendants of the Argonauts had settled on Thera,
a direct descendant of Euphemus was commanded through the Delphic Oracle
to lead his people to settle and establish Cyrene
in fulfillment of the promise made at the time of the Argonauts
were retrieving the fleece of the ram that had saved Frixis.
This descendant was known as Batas, a name that means stutterer.
He argued against the divine command on the ground
that he was not a great warrior and that he had a speech impediment,
but the Delphic Oracle refused to listen to reason
and made him do as he was told anyway.
This sounds like Moses.
Herodotus tells us that Batas ruled Cyrene for the familiar 40 years.
Hmm, that doesn't sound familiar.
We are reminded of the promise to Abraham
that his descendants would settle in Canaan
after 400 years of slavery in Egypt.
Egypte serves as a delaying yator on their way to their destiny
as Thera was in the Greek myth.
God commands Moses to lead his people to Canaan
by invoking his promise to give it to the fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Moses at first refuses by pleading that he stutters.
If Batas ruled the Argonauts for 40 years,
Moses, also once called a king
and known as a king in Philo,
led his people for 40 years also.
This narrative structure joining Abraham to Moses
echoes with accuracy the promise made to Euphemus
and its fulfillment by descendant Batas.
Both Moses and Batas invoked their trouble speaking
in order to avoid their divine mission
and both ruled over their people during 40 years.
Therefore, the similarities between the interrupted sacrifice
of Isaac and that of Phryxus
appear as part of a similar narrative structure.
It seems as though Abraham plays two different characters
from the Greek epic.
King Athamas, who almost sacrificed his son Phryxus
an episode from the beginning of the epic
and the Argonaut Euphemus
who received the promise of land for his descendants
an episode from the ending of the epic.
The order of the episodes has been reversed
in the same way the detail of the ram hung on the tree
after the sacrifice in the Greek version
appears inverted to the account of the ram
stuck in the bush before the sacrifice in Genesis.
To repeat a few lines I quoted in my earlier post
this is nil Godfrey speaking
but this time without the omissions
parallelisms must not be analyzed in an isolated way
but one must try to find out the possible narrative structure
that links the similarities together.
In other words, the similarity between Phryxus and Isaac
is not sufficient by itself to speculate about any possible barring
but when placed in the wider framework
of the epic of the Argonauts
and the foundation of the colony of Cyrene
it allows us to question a likely influence
of the Greek mythical tradition on the writings of the Old Testament.
Philip Wajinbaum notes that his thesis supports the one advanced
by Jan Wim Wesselius.
In the origin of the history of Israel
Herodotus' histories as the blueprint for the first books of the Bible
that the narratives in Herodotus have influenced the biblical narrative
but there is one significant clue thus far missing
Wajinbaum's remarks.
What might the founding of a colony in Cyrene
in Herodotus have to do with the settlement
and kingdom established in Canaan by Israel?
Wajinbaum points to an answer.
We must investigate the writings of another famous Greek writer
to find the description of a statement to be a colony
a state that would be divided into 12 tribes
and ruled by perfect God given laws
the ideal state imagined by Plato in his laws.
How late was the Bible and who really wrote it?
Neil Godfrey again comes through as has Russell Gamirkin
and several of the scholars we've brought up so far
but I'm impressed with what Neil puts here.
Here's what he has to say.
It has become a truism that the Bible
or let's be specific and acknowledge
we are discussing the Old Testament or Jewish Hebrew Bible
is a collection of various books
composed by multiple authors over many years.
All of these authors are said to have coincidentally
testified to the one and only true God of the Jewish people.
The mere fact that multiple authors spanning generations
wrote complementary works all directed at the reality
of this God working in human affairs is considered proof
that we are dealing with a cultural and religious heritage
a common tradition belonging to a single people over time.
A few scholars have challenged that thesis
and the most recently published of these is Philip Wajimbom.
He writes to have a single writer for Genesis through kings
and possibly for other biblical books contradicts the idea
of the transmission of the divine word
and of a tradition proper to a people.
The idea of a single author does not conflict
with the understanding that the sources of the Bible
were drawn from archives of Israelite and Judahite kings
as well as Mesopotamian and Canaanite and other sources.
Wajimbom claims that the traditional scholarly hypotheses
of authorship and origins of the Bible
are in fact secular rationalizations
of cultural myths about the Bible.
Let us imagine that Judea has now been conquered for a century
and its sacerdotal class is now fully Hellenized.
A man educated in the Greek fashion perhaps in Alexandria
has grown up learning all the Greek classics,
Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, the great tragic playwrights, Plato
and that which he may have read in the Alexandrian canon
established by Aristophanes of Byzantium
and Aristoccus of Samothracia.
He wants to create a literary work
that can compete with those he has read,
one that will give birth to his political
and religious utopia, Israel.
On the one hand theories about the origins of the Bible
tend to admit that the same writer wrote some books.
On the other hand several books and articles
compare Greek myths with the Bible.
It is the absence of a synthesis of all these data
that is questioned here.
Could it be the other way around?
Philip Wajimbom rejects the alternative suggestion
that it may have been the Greeks who were influenced
by the Bible or related stories from cultures
neighboring the Jews.
Essentially the reasons for resisting this idea are
1. Greek authors were generally identifiable personally
and they quite openly referred to their predecessors
and contemporaries whom they emulated and imitated.
They had no need to copy the Bible
and leave no evidence that they had any awareness of it.
2. The Greeks portrayed their myths through painting
and sculpture and here there is no suggestion
of borrowing from Jewish myths.
The only contemporary images from Palestine
are Canaanite relics.
3. Wajimbom argues that almost every chapter
of the Bible corresponds to a Greek myth
whereas the opposite is not true.
4. Greek myths are linked together
in a logical narrative progression
from the birth of the gods themselves
down to the Trojan War
and the beginnings of the historical era.
This rich and complex intertextuality
has allowed the biblical writer
to create an original epic
on a fantastic level of sophistication.
We will see how the Greek mythical genealogies
have been dismantled
and reconstructed through a specific filter.
I hope that everybody watching this
goes and subscribes to Neil Godfrey's blog.
He is doing fantastic work
mining scholars that are not well known
and we're highlighting them today.
