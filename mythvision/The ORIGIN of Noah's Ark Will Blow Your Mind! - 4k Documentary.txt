Prepare to have your mind blown.
The tale of Noah's cataclysmic global flood
is undeniably iconic,
etching itself into the record of history
encaptivating readers across the globe.
But here's the real kicker.
It turns out that Noah's heroic adventure
is not as original as we might think.
Brace yourself for a jaw-dropping revelation
as this video unfurls the shocking truth.
The biblical flood,
starring our beloved hero Noah,
is essentially a cunning makeover
of ancient Mesopotamian mythology.
Yes, you heard it right.
Genesis chapters 1-11
and even more tantalizing details
scattered throughout the book
draw heavily from pre-existing myths and legends.
This begs the question,
what does it mean if Noah's story is merely a
Johnny come lately shamelessly borrowing
from older sources to spin the Genesis narrative?
Shouldn't we pause and reflect
on the historical accuracy of what we are reading?
Could it be that Adam and Eve came and able
Enoch and Noah are nothing more
than fictional figures molded
from the much earlier myths
they so craftily repurposed?
Now hold onto your seats
because this mind-blowing video
not only provides undeniable evidence
of Genesis dependence on Mesopotamian tales
but it also delves into the intricate web
of literary intertextuality
and narrative motifs
that tie these stories together.
It's time to embrace the truth.
These accounts are not factual records
but rather captivating stories
woven with the fabric of mythology and legend.
So the next time someone tries to convince you
that the Bible predates these Mesopotamian myths
or that it stands independently
without borrowing their narrative threads
unleash this video upon them.
It's a compelling expose that will leave
even the staunchest defenders
of biblical historicity in all.
The origins of Noah's flood
picture this
a god who just a few chapters earlier
created everything
including man fashioned in his divine image
resembling him and his celestial council
all was splendidly good
until those pesky humans went and messed it all up
by nibbling on forbidden godly fruit.
Let's not forget
that it was the same god
who planted a talking snake in the garden
to tempt these unsuspecting mortals
into unlocking their eyes
and gaining godlike knowledge of good and evil.
Instead of taking responsibility
for placing the temptation in their path
godlike any loving parent
promptly evicted his own creation
from the primordial paradise
that suspiciously resembles
Lonion Utopia.
Now Adam and Eve are left to toil
and struggle
scraping out a living
and experiencing excruciating pain
during childbirth.
But hold on tight
because it gets even worse.
The first children of these first parents
end up on an ancient version
of unsolved mysteries
with Cain committing fratricide
and bumping off his only brother, Abel.
And you won't believe the reason
behind this murder spree.
Apparently
Cain offered god
a humble basket of fruits
while Abel dazzled
the divine taste buds
with a mouthwatering filet mignon.
And just like a doting parent
god rejected the fruit salad
in devoured Abel's juicy barbecue.
It's almost reminiscent
of the time Prometheus
pulled a fast one on Zeus
who demanded that humans
sacrifice a portion
of each animal to the gods.
Prometheus decided to wrap
bones in succulent fat,
cleverly hiding the filet mignon
inside the animal's hide.
When Zeus made his choice
he unwittingly
selected the fatty deception
resulting in his wrath
and the subsequent punishment
of mankind
and Prometheus.
The good times.
Back to our twisted family saga.
Cain is cursed and banished
from the land,
eventually setting down
finding a wife and naming
his child Enoch,
a child with multiple parentage
as it turns out.
You see the genealogies in Genesis
5 are nothing more than fabricated
traditions,cleverly
inserted into the Bible.
It's like having two
contradictory creation accounts
in Genesis 1 and 2
where a priestly scribe
tried his best to merge them into
one cohesive tale.
The same game is at play
with these genealogies leading
up to Noah's flood.
The cataclysmic event that wiped
out this once very good
creation.
Thanks to this priestly scribe
or scribes,many later
traditions tried to explain the
lineage of Cain vs.
Seth.
Now if you're as curious as I am
about why this seemingly good god
would obliterate mankind
and still be regarded as benevolent
by the biblical authors
then stay tuned.
This video will not only reveal the true
origins of Noah's flood story
but also debunk the flood
related conspiracy theories
and misinformation that run
rampant on the internet.
So forget tuning into Joe Rogan
for ill-informed flood discussions
and join us
as we present the facts
straight from the mouths of experts
specializing an ancient sumer

and of course
the Bible.

It should come as no surprise to us
that the story of a god
destroying the world with a flood
was not new to the book of Genesis.
More than a thousand years
before the story found its way into the Bible
it was etched into clay tablets
in ancient Mesopotamia
in the Sumerian
and Akkadian languages
The earliest cuneiform texts
that contain the Mesopotamian flood
story
date to the early 2nd millennium BCE
a time known as the old Babylonian
period
roughly 2000-1600 BCE
Messapotamian Precursors

We will begin with the Sumerian
version of the story
excavated from the ancient
sumerian city of Nippur
The story begins with creation
where the gods An,Inlil
Inki and Ninhursag
created humanity
and the animals in order
that they might do work
to provide for the gods
Let them build many cities
so that I can refresh myself
in their shade
Let them lay the bricks of many cities
in pure places
Let them establish places of divination
in pure places
and when the fire quenching
is arranged
the divine rights and exalted powers
are perfected
and the earth is irrigated
I will establish well being there
After a fragmentary section
the story continues
describing how
Kingship descended from heaven
to earth
and the cities were built in Sumer
These sacred cities were assigned to individual gods
Inki was to lead Eridu
Sud was over Sharupak
and the sun god Utu
was placed in charge of Sipar
the land had been established
the right to rule
had been granted by the gods
and the sacred temples
had been built in the cities
for the benefit of their gods
all was right with the world
but it was not to last
the text again becomes
fragmentary
but we can see that something
eventually went wrong
the gods convened and determined
that they would send a flood
over all the earth
in order to destroy their creation
On,Inlil,Inki and Ninhursag
made all the gods of heaven and earth
take an oath by invoking
on and inlil
but Inki quietly descended
having taken the oath
not to reveal these plans to humanity
he could not simply warn the people
instead through his cunning
he descended to earth
and found Ziyuudsudra
the one of long life
who would ultimately survive the flood
Inki could not simply warn Ziyuudsudra
insteadhe spoke to a wall
that Ziyuudsudra was standing near
sidewall standing at my left side
sidewall I will speak words to you
take heed of my words
pay attention to my instructions
a flood will sweep over
a decision that the seed of mankind
is to be destroyed has been made
the verdict
the word of the divine assembly
cannot be revoked
the order
announced by on and inlil
cannot be overturned
Inki then explains to Ziyuudsudra
what he is to do to survive
although the text is broken
in the section that describes the instructions
the building of the boat
when the story picks back up
we see the flood had finally happened
all the windstorms
and gales rose together
and the flood swept over
after the flood had swept over the land
and waves and windstorms
had rocked the huge boat for seven days
and seven nights
Utu the sun god came out
in heaven and earth
Ziyuudsudra could drill an opening
in the huge boat
and the hero Utu
entered the huge boat
with his rays
Ziyuudsudra the king prostrated himself
before Utu
the king sacrificed oxen
and offered innumerable sheep
in the final section of the story
the gods determine what to do
with Ziyuudsudra
as they had not expected anyone
to survive the flood
more and more animals disembarked
on to the earth
Ziyuudsudra the king prostrated himself
before on and inlil
on and inlil treatedZiyuudsudra kindly
they granted him life like a god
they brought down to him eternal life
at the same time
because of preserving the animals
and the seed of humankind
they settled Ziyuudsudra the king
in an overseas country
in the land of Bilmun
where the sun rises
we now turn our attention
to the famous Akkadian story
of Atrahasis
part of the old Babylonian
flood tradition from Mesopotamia
the story opens with the lesser gods
doing the work of forced labor
work that would later be placed upon
mankind
when gods were men
they did forced labor
they bore drudgery
great indeed was the drudgery of the gods
they forced labor was heavy
the misery too much
the great gods Anu,inlil and Inki
divided up the world
on taking the sky as his home
inlil taking the earth
an Inki dwelling in the Apsu
the freshwater sphere under the earth
the lesser gods toiled and labored
eventually rebelling against the great gods
eventually the great gods decided to
create humanity by killing
the lesser god who started the rebellion
and mixing him with clay
to create humans
who would then bear the load of serving the gods
humanity begins to reproduce
1200 years had not gone by
the land had grown numerous
the peoples had increased
the land was bellowing like a bull
the god was disturbed with their uproar
inlil heard their clamor
he said to the great gods
the clamor of humankind has become
burdensome to me
I am losing sleep to their uproar
inlil devises a plan to get some sleep
decimate humanity
he first attempts to send a plague
but Inki just as in the Sumerian flood story
tells a human by the name of Atrahasis
exceedingly wise
how to save everyone from the plague
and Inki continues to make noise
after another 1200 years
the noise continues to increase
and Inlil devises another plan
cut off provisions for the peoples
let plant life be too scantly for their hunger
let adod the storm god
withdraw his rain
below let the flood not come up from the depths
then Inki advises Atrahasis
who rescues humanity
finally
inlil decides to send a flood
but not before Inki swears an oath
that he will not make known the plan
of the gods to humanity
as in the Sumerian story
Inki uses his cunning
to circumvent his oath
pay attention to my words
flee house
build boat
for sick possessions
and save life
the boat that you build
cover her with tarpaulins
roof her over like the death
so that the sun will not see inside her
let her be roofed over for and after
the gear should be very firm
make her strong
Atrahasis goes to people in his city
and gets them to help him construct the boat
and he gathersanimals and other provisions
when the time for the flood actually came
he was ready
the outlook of the weather changed
a god began to roar in the clouds
the god they heard
his clamor
he brought pitch to fill his door
by the time he had bolted his door
a god was roaring in the clouds
the winds were furious as he set forth
he cut the mooring rope
he released the boat
the storm that brought the flood
was so terrible
so violent
that even the gods themselves were afraid
the gods became afraid of the clamor
of the deluge
they took refuge in heaven
they crouched outside
anu became afraid of the clamor
of the deluge
it was terrifying the gods
furthermore they realized that
without humanity to serve them
they were unable to eat and drink
for humans provided their daily provisions
they immediately regretted their decision
to annihilate humanity
there is a break in the text
but when it picks back up
it appears that the flood has subsided
and atrahasis has offered sacrifices to the gods
the gods sniffed the savor
they were gathered like flies around the offering
after they had eaten the offering
anu arose to rail against all of them
where has anu come to
the chief decision maker
has inlil drawn nigh the incense
they who irrationally brought about the flood
and relegated the peoples to catastrophe
the end of the story is again fragmentary
but inlil finds out that atrahasis has survived
the warrior inlil saw the vessel
and was filled with anger at the igigi gods
all we great anuna gods
resolved together on an oath
where did life escape
how did a man survive the catastrophe
anu made ready to speak and said to the warrior inlil
who could do this but inki
anu
the final mesopotamian story that we will cover
that preserves the flood story
is the epic of Gilgamesh
another text that goes back to the old Babylonian period
although the flood story is contained in tablet 11
of the epic we should briefly explain the events
leading up to the telling of the story
Gilgameshwho was two-thirds divine
was an unruly king of the city of Uruk
the people of Urukasked the gods to help
and they create inki-do
who has commonality with the animal kingdom
and lives in the steep outside the city
he is eventually made human and brought to meet Gilgamesh
and together they go on grand adventures
in order to make a name for themselves
ultimately however
inlil becomes displeased with some of their actions
and inki-do is condemned to die
after mourning the loss of his friend
Gilgamesh fills his own mortality
and sets off to find eternal life
this ultimately leads him to the end of the world
across the sea of death
where he finds Utenapishtim
meaning I found life
a man who had gained immortality
when Gilgamesh asked Utenapishtim
how he was able to find eternal life
he told him the story of how he survived the flood
Utenapishtim
described how the gods determined to send a flood
to destroy humanity
their father Anu swore an oath
and their counselor the hero Inlil
their chamberlain
the god Ninnurta
and their sheriff the god Innugi
princeleaea swore with them also
repeating their words to a fence made of reed
Oh fence of reed
Oh wall of brick
hear this
Oh fence
Oh wall
Oh man of Sherupak
Son of Ubatutu
demolish the house and build a boat
abandon wealth and seek survival
spurn property,save life
take on board the boat all living things seed
Utenapishtim builds the boat
and gathers the animals and all his provisions
the flood came and the gods became terrified
at the storm and regretted sending the flood
even the gods took fright at the deluge
they fret and went up to the heaven of Anu
lying like dogs curled up in the open
the goddess crying out like a woman in childbirth
Bellette Ali welled
whose voice is so sweet
the olden times have turned to clay
because I spoke evil in the gods assembly
and declare a war to destroy my people
it is I who give birth
these people are mine
and now like fish they fill the ocean
the storm eventually relented
and the boat ran aground on Mount Nimush
the seventh day when it came
I brought out a dove
I let it loose
off went the dove
but then it returned
there was no place to land
so back it came to me
I brought out a swallow
I let it loose
off went the swallow
but then it returned
there was no place to land
so back it came to me
I brought out a raven
I let it loose
off it went the raven
it saw the waters receding
finding food bowing and bobbing
it did not come back to me
Utena Pishton disembarks
offers sacrifices
and the gods gather around the sacrifice
Inlil discovers that humans have sacrificed
then at once
Inlil arrived
he saw the boat
he was seized with anger
filled with rage at the divine
from where escaped this living being
no man was meant to survive the destruction
after it is revealed how they survived
Inlil grants
Utena Pishton
and his wife a special gift
in the past
Utena Pishty was a mortal man
but now he and his wife shall become like us gods
Utena Pishty shall dwell far away
where the rivers flow forth
so far away they took me
and settled me where the rivers flow forth
The flood story in the bible
The biblical flood story follows the same pattern
that we have seen thus far
in the Mesopotamian traditions
with a few important distinctions
that we will cover later
Genesis 6 opens with human beings
greatly multiplying
just as we have seen in other stories
however divine beings come down
and procreate with human women
In this context
the story describes humanity
as being incredibly wicked
leading to Yahweh
regretting that he had even created them
he then resolves to destroy all humans
save for Noah and his family
he instructs Noah on how to build a boat
and to gather animals to bring aboard
Yahweh sends the flood
and destroys all life on earth
save for those on the boat
after the floodwaters receive
noah sends out his birds
to see if the waters had gone down
far enough for land to come back into view
after 40 days
noah opened a window he had made in the ark
and sent out a raven
and it kept flying back and forth
until the water had dried up from the earth
then he sent out a dove
to see if the water had receded
from the surface of the ground
the dove could find nowhere to perch
because there was water over
all the surface of the earth
so it returnedto Noah in the ark
he reached out his hand
and took the dove
and brought it back to himself in the ark
he waited seven more days
and again sent out the dove from the ark
when the dove returned to him in the evening
therein its beak
was a freshly plucked olive leaf
then Noah knew
that the water had receded
from the earth
noah and his family ultimately disembark
and offer sacrifices
to Yahweh
who smells the sacrifice
and is pleased
The Flood Narrative in Enoch
The Flood Narrative in Enoch
The Flood Narrative in Enoch
The Book of Enoch also describes the flood
in an expanded form of what we see
in the Book of Genesis
when the sons of men had multiplied
in those days beautiful
and comely daughters were born to them
and the watchers, the sons of heaven
saw them and desired them
and they said to one another
come let us choose for ourselves
wives from the daughters of men
and let us beget children for ourselves
when these angelic beings
begun to mate with the human women
they taught them sorcery, charms
cutting of roots and plants
alongwith a host of divination practices
when we come to the flood story
noah realizes that destruction
is on the horizon
he travels to the ends of the earth
and finds his great grandfather Enoch
to find out what is happening
Enoch replies
A command has gone forth
from the presence of the lord
against the inhabitants of the earth
that their end is accomplished
for they have learned all the secrets
of the angels
and all the violence of the satans
and all their powers
the hidden secrets
and all the powers of those who practice sorcery
and the powers of brightly colored garments
and the powers of those who cast molten images
for all the earth
Leaving no question as to the reason for the flood
the text reads
The lord of spirits knows that you are pure
and blameless
of this reproach concerning the mysteries
God eventually tells noah
Your lot has come up to me
A lot without blame
A lot of love and uprightness
And now the angels are making a wooden vessel
And when the angels have completed that task
I will put my hand upon it and protect it
And from it will come the seat of life
And a change will take place
So that the earth will not remain desolate
The story is not told in the same detail
But the destruction of the world by the flood with noah
Being saved in a boat remains the same
Points of contact
Let's look at some of the
biblical lexical connections that can be seen
in the Genesis flood story
Starting with Genesis 614
The Hebrew word Kofur
Pitch
It appears in this verse as highly suggestive
of dependenceof the biblical flood story
This word appears only here
In Genesis 614
It shows up nowhere else in the Bible
Conversely, it's a cateen cognate
Cupru is very common
And it shows up in a wide variety of contexts
Including, you guessed it
The flood stories in both Atrahasis
And the epic of Gilgamesh
In Atrahasis, Eya
Gives these instructions for building the ark
Roof it over like the depths
So that the sun will not see inside her
Let her be roofed over, for and aft
The gear should be very firm
The pitchCupru
Should be firm
Make her strong
Similarly, in the epic of Gilgamesh
We see the building of the ark in progress
At the first glimmer of dawn
The land was assembling at the gate of Atrahasis
The carpenter carried his adds
The reed cutter carried his stone
The shipwright carried his broad axe
The young men, the old men
Brought the coiled palm fiber
The wealthy carried pitchCupru
In short, in both Atrahasis
And the epic of Gilgamesh
In the sections describing
The building of the ark
This very common word
Cupru, pitch, bitumen
Is used to describe how the ark
Is supposed to be sealed
In Genesis 614
We see the same Semitic word
Copher, in the exact same context
But moreover, this is the only place
Where the word appears in the Old Testament
Furthermore, there is another word for pitch
Hamar, that appears elsewhere
In the Hebrew Bible, three times
Genesis 11.3, 14.10
And Exodus 2.3
This means that Hebrew already had
A perfectly suitable word
That referred to a substance
That was used to seal the outside of something
To make it watertight
And yet the author of this story
Opted for an entirely foreign cognate
In its place
Another interesting word
Is used in Genesis 8.2
The headwaters of the deep
And the windows of heaven
Were stopped up, sacchar
And the rain from heaven
Was held back
This word, sacchar
Is another of these rare words
Appearing in the Hebrew Bible
Only twice
Here and in Psalm 63.12
However, it's a Cadian cognate
Sakeru is very common
And as you might expect
It occurs in context
That speak of the stopping up
Of the waters in one version
Of Atrahasis
A dod, the storm god
Above made his reign scarce
Below the river was blocked up
Sakeru
Not raised the flood from the abyss
The fields diminished their yields
The immediate contexts
And these two flood narratives
Are not the same
Atrahasis is speaking
Of stopping up the waters
To keep the crops from growing
While Genesis 8
Speaks of stopping up the waters
To end the flood itself
Nevertheless, the fact
That this very rare word
Is used in common between both texts
To describe the same scenario
Seems more than a simple coincidence
Before we conclude this section
Let's look at one final point of contact
In the flood account
The story of Noah
Sinning out the dove
As you recall
From the introduction to this chapter
There is a clear parallel to this portion
Of the story in the epic of Gilgamesh
Gilugrahasana da
I brought out a dove and set it free
The dove swore off in search of food
No landing place appeared to it
So it came back
I brought out a swallow and set it free
The swallow swore off in search of food
No landing place appeared to it
So it came back to me
I brought out a raven and set it free
小一個 see sure off et solve the every new water
it ain't scratched in and Bob two
it so it did not come back
나오는 paralel
巍安
11 line 150
these lines read
but the dove did not find a perch for the soul of its foot
and it returned to him to the ark
genesis 8 verse 9
no perch was available for it and it came back to me
gilgamesh tablet 11 verse 150
if there is a direct textual dependence of the biblical text
on the epic of gogamesh
then the later author would have translated
the Akkadian line into Hebrew
low and behold here
there is a strong conceptual similarity between these two lines
what's the point
there is an overall point to the story of the flood in genesis
if you recall from genesis 1 following their creation
humanity was charged to multiply and spread out through the earth
this command shows up again at the end of the flood account
and is ultimately resolved by force in genesis 11
as we discussed above
this is part of a long literary movement throughout the primeval history
used to make a series of theological points
in this case
the priority of Yahweh's commission for humanity to multiply
and fill the earth is in view
however
beginning in genesis chapters 2 and 3
humanity crosses the boundary established between humans
and deities by partaking of the fruit
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
becoming wise and godlike
Yahweh sends them out of the garden and over time
humanity becomes numerous on the earth
and they again cross the boundary between deities and humans
genesis 6 1-4
in the flood, Yahweh essentially hits the reset button
returning the world to its pre-creation watery chaotic state
for example, in genesis 7 verses 11-23
we read of the water above the sky
returning and the water under the earth coming back up
when compared to genesis 1 verses 1-2
you see that the text is telling of an uncreation
and a return to the pre-creation state
the result of the flood is a new beginning
with Noah and his family
combinating with the reiteration of god's command in genesis 128
to go and fill the earth
as we noted above
humanity fails to obey this directive
but instead joins together
to again attempt to cross the boundary
between human and divine
by Cain building a city
and after the flood
noah's descendants build a tower to reach heaven
this arc within the narrative strongly suggests
that the primeval history
is acting as an intentional inversion
to Mesopotamian thought and traditions
particularly with respect to civilization
it should come as no surprise
therefore that scholars see the flood story
with all its points of apparent intertextuality
as a counter narrative
to the Mesopotamian flood stories
it has been argued by scholars
that one of the ways that the genesis flood story
responds to the Mesopotamian flood narratives
is by contrasting the actions
of the deities involved
consider the story of Atrahasis
the flood is brought upon humanity
and the text reads
the goddess sought weeping
the midwife of the gods
the wise mammy
let the day grow dark
let it turn back to gloom
in the assembly of the gods
how did i agree with them on annihilation
she continues
she brought about the flood
and relegated the peoples to catastrophe
we even see
the gods commanded annihilation
inlil committed the evil deeds against the peoples
similarly the epic of Gilgamesh reads
the gods should come to the incense offering
butinlil should not come to the incense offering
becausehe brought on the flood without thinking
and marked my people for destruction
when you view the story of Atrahasis as a whole
you see that one of the main points of the narrative
is to explain why so many humans die in birth
or why some women cannot conceive
this contrast sharply
with what we have argued the genesis narrative is emphasizing
as the focus is on the command
be fruitful and multiply
more than this counter to the population reduction theme
in the Mesopotamian tradition
it is likely that the genesis flood account
contrast Yahweh's justification
for sending the flood
over against that which is seen
in Atrahasis and the epic of Gilgamesh
ifinlil and the other gods were considered
lacking in judgment
even evil in bringing the flood
what about Yahweh
the text does not leave us to wonder
and Yahweh saw the wickedness of humanity
in the land was great
and every intention of the thoughts of their hearts
was only evil all the time
and Yahweh was sorry that he had made humanity
on the earthand he was grieved in his heart
genesis 6 5-6
was Yahweh capricious
and hasty in his destruction of the earth
absolutely not
far from the evil action of inlil
Yahweh was morally bound to bring about the flood
at least that is how the authors who penned this myth
tried to paint their god in this myth
it doesn't seem as bad especially
if one sees this god as just another
ancient near eastern deity
with limitations on what the humans
were going to do from the start
how's that for a mind blowing revelation
it seems that those clever biblical authors
took the earlier flood traditions
which had been cherished stories in the ancient near east
for countless generations
and flipped the scriptto create their own flood myth
