Today we delve into the multifaceted character of Jacob, the biblical patriarch, who stands
not only as a pivotal individual, but also symbolizes the entirety of the nation of Israel.
His narratives intriguingly resonate with those of King David and even bear thematic parallels
to Greek tales, a connection we shall elucidate in this video.
The cultural milieu from which the biblical authors drew inspiration is deeply rooted
in the Canaanite mythos, with discernible imprints from both Mesopotamian and Egyptian
civilizations.
As we navigate the book of Genesis, it becomes evident that we are not merely traversing
historical accounts, but rather engaging with a rich tapestry of storytelling.
Our previous documentary on Abraham highlighted the mythological undertones present, not
just in the initial chapters of Genesis 1-11, but throughout.
The narratives of Abraham and Isaac, for instance, strikingly near the tales of Athimus and
Frixus, were divine interventions replaced potential child sacrifices with rams.
In our exploration of the tables of nations, as showcased in our documentary on Noah's
Curse, we discerned literary parallels between Noah and Lot.
Both figures emerge from cataclysms, one aquatic and the other infernal.
Their subsequent actions, influenced by wine, have profound implications for their descendants
and the nations they represent.
It is noteworthy that post-flood genealogies and Greek myths stand unique, diverging from
Mesopotamian counterparts.
Unlike the Bible, it does not get its stuff from the Mesopotamia pertaining to the genealogies.
The Greeks?
There you have it.
As we now turn our focus to Jacob, we find his narrative interwoven with elements reminiscent
of Greek myths.
Before we delve deeper, it's imperative to provide a succinct overview of Jacob's life.
Join us on this enlightening journey.
A summary of Jacob's life.
Jacob, Isaac's son and Abraham's grandson, was born alongside his twin Esau.
Their sibling rivalry began in the womb and would shape Jacob's life.
Jacob, a homebody, was his mother Rebecca's favorite.
Unlike his outdoorsy brother, he was more strategic and cunning.
He cleverly traded a meal for Esau's birthright and with Rebecca's guidance, deceived his
nearly blind father to steal Esau's blessing.
His deceit forced Jacob to flee to Padan, Iran to escape Esau's wrath.
In route to Iran, Jacob dreamt of a heavenly ladder and made a vow to God at Bethel.
In Iran, he fell for his cousin Rachel and agreed to work seven years for her hand in
marriage.
However, his uncle Laban tricked him into marrying Rachel's elder sister, Leah.
Jacob then worked another seven years to marry Rachel.
His family grew rapidly, with his wives and their maids bearing him many children.
However, tensions arose with Laban, leading Jacob to return to Palestine.
On his journey, he wrestled with a mysterious man, or dare I say God, earning the name Israel.
Back in Palestine, Jacob faced challenges from reconciling with Esau to dealing with
the fallout of his daughter Dina's violation.
Yet he remained devout, building altars and seeking God's guidance.
Tragedy struck when Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin.
Later, Jacob's sons, envious of his favoritism toward Joseph, sold Joseph into slavery and
deceived Jacob out of his fate.
Years later, during a famine, Jacob's sons traveled to Egypt for grain, only to discover
Joseph was a now powerful Egyptian ruler.
At 130, Jacob relocated his family to Egypt's Goshen region.
As death approached, Jacob ensured he'd be buried in Canaan and prophesied his sons'
futures.
He passed away at 147 years of age, leaving a legacy that spanned generations.
Jacob, Esau, and Echoes from Greek mythology, Philip Vajenbaum's microscope.
I will be covering a series of examples from Dr. Philip Vajenbaum's book, Argonauts of
the Desert.
You should seriously look into this book as well.
Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren, and the Lord granted his prayer.
And his wife, Rebecca, conceived.
The children struggled together within her, and she said, If it is to be this way, why
do I live?
So she went to inquire of the Lord, and the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your
womb, and two peoples, born of you, shall be divided.
One shall be stronger than the other.
The elder shall serve the younger.
Lankius reigned over Argos after Deneas and Begat, a son Ebis by hypermenstra, and Ebis
had two twin sons, Echricius and Proteus by Aglaea, daughter of Mantoneus.
These two quarreled with each other while they were still in the womb, and when they
were grown up, they waged war for the kingdom, and in the course of the war, they were the
first to invent shields.
And Echricius gained the mastery and drove Proteus from Argos, and Proteus went to Lankia
to the court of Lobotus.
Or as some say, Amphianix, and married his daughter, whom Homer calls Antia.
The tragic poets call her Snethiboya.
His father-in-law restored him to his own land with the army of Lycians, who occupied
Tirans, which the Cyclopes had fortified for him.
They divided the whole of the Arngive territory between them and settled it.
Echricius reigned over Argos and Proteus over Tirans.
James George Fraser, in his work on Apollodorus' library, highlighted the striking similarities
between these stories.
Just as Echricius and Proteus had their differences, biblical twins Jacob and Esau were adversaries.
Yet destiny brought Jacob and Esau back together to divide their inherited land in Genesis
33.
While Esau became the forefather of Edom, Jacob's lineage led to Israel in Genesis 36.
The character of Proteus also finds mention in Homer's Iliad.
Homer narrates an episode where Proteus, after initially welcoming the hero Balerophon, deceitfully
sends him to his father-in-law with a sealed letter, which secretly orders Balerophon's
execution.
You'll remember this later.
I want you to look at the comparisons between Proteus and Jacob or Israel.
Here are some parallels.
1.
In both cases, they are born twins and fought in the womb before they are born.
Jacob and Israel, if you will, from the Bible with Esau, born as twins and fought with twin
in the womb, Echricius, which is the brother of Proteus, the twin brother, born as twins
and fought with twin Proteus in the womb.
2.
Fought over territory with the twin.
Both in the Jacob Esau and the Echricius and Proteus, they both fought over territory.
3.
Settled different lands at peace with the twin.
With cases, you have the Edomites with Esau and you have Israel with Jacob, and in the
Echricius and Proteus one, settled different lands and was at peace with Proteus, ruled
over Argos, while Proteus ruled Tyreans.
4.
Had a daughter, Dina or Dine.
Both sound very similar.
5.
Daughter abused against their will.
Once you get to number 5, you kind of have to ask yourself, born as twins, fought in
the womb, fought over territory, finally made peace, and both ruled different lands.
They both have a daughter that sounds similar.
Then you get to number 5 and you find out that they both had daughters who were raped
by people who claimed they loved her.
In both narratives.
Huh.
Coink-a-dink?
I think not.
And you're going to see that as this entire video unravels.
More and more.
Again, another parallel graph for you to look at.
All of these are checked off.
Now enters Heracles.
In parallels, Martin L. West observed similarities between the biblical story of Esau being deprived
of his blessing and the Greek tale of the births of Heracles and Eurystheus.
In the Bible, Genesis 27, an aging and visually impaired Isaac intends to bless his elder
son Esau.
He sends Esau hunting, promising a blessing upon his return.
However, Rebecca, favoring Jacob, devises a plan.
Given the stark difference in their physical appearance, Jacob's smooth skin versus Esau's
hairiness.
Rebecca uses goat hair to disguise Jacob.
Fooled by this ruse, Isaac mistakenly blesses Jacob for seeing his dominance over his siblings
in Genesis 27, 29.
After Jacob received Isaac's blessings, Esau returned from his hunt.
Upon realizing the deception, he was heartbroken and pleaded with Isaac for a blessing of his
own.
Isaac, bound by his words, gave Esau a lesser blessing, stating that he would serve his
younger brother, Jacob.
This scenario mirrors an earlier biblical account where Noah blesses his sons, Shem,
and Japheth, and declares Canaan will serve them.
Isaac's words foreshadow the destinies of their descendants, the nations of Israel and
Edom, which we further explore in the books of Samuel and Kings in Argonauts of the Desert
by Philip Vashembaum.
Angry and feeling betrayed, Esau contemplates killing Jacob.
To protect their favorite son, Rebecca advises Jacob to flee to her brother Laban, considering
marrying one of his daughters.
Our M.L. West draws a parallel between the biblical narrative and a tale from the Iliad.
In the Iliad, Zeus is deceived by Hera, leading to the birth of Heracles and Eurystheus.
Zeus and fate, an eeriness that walks in the darkness struck me mad when we were assembled
on the day that I took from Achilles the me that had been awarded to him.
What could I do?
All things are in the hand of heaven and folly, eldest of Zeus' daughters, shuts men's
eyes to their destruction.
She walks delicately, not on solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them
stumble or to ensnare them.
Time was when she fooled Zeus himself.
Who, they say, is the greatest sweater of gods or men.
For Hera, woman though she was, beguiled him on the day when Elkmana was to bring forth
mighty Heracles in the fair city of Thebes.
He told it among the gods, saying, Hear me all gods and goddesses, that I may speak even
as I am minded.
This day shall, Elithua, helper of women who are in labor, bring a man child into the world
who shall be the Lord over all that dwell about.
Him who are of my blood and lineage, then said Hera, all crafty and full of guile.
You will play false and will not hold to your word.
Swear me, O Olympian, swear me, O great oath, that he who shall this day fall between the
feet of a woman shall be Lord over all that dwell about him who are of your blood and
lineage.
Thus, she spoke, and Zeus suspected her not, but swore the great oath to his much-ruined
thereafter.
For Hera darted down from the high summit of Olympus and went to haste to the Achaean
Argos, where she knew that the noble wife, a Stalinist, son of Perseus, then was.
She being with child, and in her seventh month, Hera brought the child to birth, though there
was a month still wanting.
But she stayed the offspring of Elkma, and kept back to Elithua.
Then she went to tell Zeus, the son of Kronos, and said, Father Zeus, Lord of Lightning,
I have a word for your ear.
There is a fine child this day, Erestheus, son of Thelonus, the son of Perseus, he is
of your lineage.
It is well, therefore, that he should reign over the Argyres on this day.
On this Zeus was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught folly by the hair
and swore a great oath that never should she again invade starry heaven in Olympus, for
she was the bane of all.
Then he whirled her around with the twist of his hands and flung her down from heaven,
so that she fell on the fields of mortal men.
And he was ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labors that
Erestheus laid upon him.
West points out a fascinating parallel.
Just as a father is about to favor one son, a mother's intervention changes the course
of events.
This is evident in the story of Hera's jealousy in Greek mythology, which led to Heracles
serving Eurystheus and undertaking the famous twelve labors.
This mirrors Rebekah's scheme in the Bible, where Jacob deceives Isaac to receive Esau's
blessing and have twelve tribes descend from him.
West may have missed a connection, though.
Both the tales of Ecclesius and Proteus, and that of Heracles and Eurystheus, seem to be
intertwined.
Delving into Apollodorus's library, we find that Ecclesius is the grandfather of the
famed hero, Perseus.
Perseus, in turn, has descendants, including Heracles and Eurystheus.
This shared lineage suggests that the biblical narrative of Jacob and Esau might have been
influenced by these Greek myths.
Interestingly, the stories of Jacob and David in the Bible seem to echo each other.
Both face deceit from a father-in-law, had wives who practiced idolatry and dealt with
family scandals involving their children.
Look at this graph with me.
You have parallels between Jacob and King David.
One, the treacheries of a father-in-law.
Jacob faced treachery from his father-in-law, Laban, who tricked him over and over.
King David faced treachery from his father-in-law, Saul.
Two, wives committing idolatry.
Jacob's wife, Rachel, committed idolatry worshiping the terrapheme and took her father's
idols, which he chased them out into the wilderness for.
King David, David's wife, Michael, committed idolatry, worshiping terrapheme.
Three, daughters defiled and avenged.
Jacob's daughter, Dina, was defiled and avenged by Simeon.
David's daughter, Themar, was defiled and avenged by Absalom.
Four, sons commit incest.
Jacob's son, Ruben, committed incest.
David's son, Absalom, committed incest.
David will commit murder by sending Uriah the Hittite to Joab, bearing a sealed letter
instructing Joab to have him killed on the battlefield.
This theme is found as well in the story of Proteus, as we talked about above.
This is one of the first pieces of evidence that both stories of Jacob and David being
parallel were modeled after the same sources and written by the same single author.
In a nutshell, this shows whoever the author is in Genesis knows the story of David and
they're working off of the same narrative, probably because this is the same author according
to Vajambam, but at the very least, they are looking at the other narrative to construct
the other narrative.
Vajambam thinks it's simple, Occam's razor, and this is the same author, but this also
tells you something about the source from which the Bible author is getting their material.
And that Proteus story where he sends Balerophon, that where he sends him and he doesn't even
know he's carrying the letter to his own self-destruction, is found in the Greek source.
In the beginning of our discussion, we talked about how the order of stories from Greek
sources was mixed up and changed by the author.
But interestingly, in both the Greek stories and in Genesis 25-27 from the Bible, we see
similar characters and events.
Think of it like this, Jacob is like the character Eurystheus and Esau is like Heracles.
It's interesting to note that Esau, who's a tough hunter, trades his special family
rights just for a simple bowl of soup.
Now Pseudo-Apollodorus didn't influence the Bible because it came much later.
But many believe that the works of Homer, especially the Iliad, did.
In fact, the Iliad seems to have inspired many stories about David in the book of Samuel,
and the stories about Jacob seem to set the stage for those about David.
When we don't have all the pieces of the puzzle from older sources, we use Apollodorus to
help fill in the blanks.
The stories about Heracles, for instance, are best understood through the writings by
Apollodorus and Diodorus Siculus.
It's essential to remember that amidst all these Greek tales, the Bible's main message
is about the dangers of too much power, especially in kingship and how it doesn't match the
ideal vision of a perfect state.
Jacob, as the father of the twelve tribes, is like the first version of Israel and David
is like a do-over or a second version.
But David, with his misuse of power, ends up breaking this perfect vision.
As we dive deeper into Jacob's stories, we will see even more similarities with the
tales of Hercules.
Jacob, Laban, Heracles and Theespius Simplified Comparison
Jacob, seeking refuge from his brother's anger, journeyed to his uncle Laban's home.
He desired to marry Rachel, Laban's younger daughter, and agreed to work for seven years
as her bride price, yet Laban deceived him.
On their wedding night, Laban secretly sent Leah, his elder daughter, to Jacob.
It was only the next morning that Jacob realized the switch.
Laban justified his actions by explaining that it was customary for the elder daughter
to marry first.
She then offered Rachel's hand in marriage if Jacob agreed to work another seven years.
This tale of deception mirrors another from Greek mythology.
Now this Theespius was king of Theespiae, and Hercules went to him when he wished to catch
the lion.
The king entertained him for fifty days and each night as Hercules went forth to the hunt,
Theespius bedded one of his daughters with him, fifty daughters having been born to him
by Megha, Mead, daughter of Arneus, for he was anxious that all of them should have children
by Hercules.
Thus Hercules, though he thought that his bedfellow was always the same, had intercourse
with them all, and having vanquished the lion, he dressed himself in the skin and wore the
scalp as a helmet.
Theespius wanted grandchildren from the strong and famous Heracles because he didn't have
any sons.
So he tricked Heracles into spending the night with each of his fifty daughters, one at a
time.
The catch?
Heracles thought he was with the same woman every time.
This story is similar to when Jacob ended up with Leah, thinking she was Rachel.
From these relationships, Jacob had twelve sons and Heracles' family later became rulers
in Sardinia.
There's another story about Jacob being constantly tricked by Laban, never getting what he worked
hard for.
This story reminds us of Leomidon, an ancient king of Troy.
Leomidon once cheated two gods, Apollo and Poseidon, after they helped him build Troy's
walls.
As punishment, the gods wanted his daughter, Hessiani, to be offered to a sea monster.
Leomidon promised Heracles some fine horses if he'd save Hessiani.
But after Heracles did the job, Leomidon went back on his word.
Angry?
Heracles attacked and destroyed Troy.
This story was later retold by Leomidon's son, De Puyolimos, during a big battle in
Troy just before he met his end.
Far other was Heracles, my own brave and line-hearted father, who came here for the horses of Leomidon.
And though he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius
and made a wilderness of her highways.
You are a coward and your people are falling from you.
For all your strength and all your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans,
but will pass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand.
This narrative underscores another instance where Heracles faced deceit and broken promises.
Look at this graph on the parallels, just a couple to point out between Jacob and Heracles.
Number 1.
Slept with the wrong woman.
Jacob was tricked by Laban into sleeping with Lea, Heracles was tricked by Theespis into
thinking he was sleeping with the same girl for 50 nights, but it was 50 different women.
Number 2.
Deceived and given broken promises, Jacob was deceived by Laban with broken promises, Heracles
was promised horses by Leomidon, the first king of Troi who didn't keep his promises.
Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plain and peeled white streaks in them,
Spoken the white of the rods, he set the rods that he had peeled in front of the flocks,
in the troughs, that is the watering places, where the flocks came to drink, and since
they bred when they came to drink, the flocks bred in front of the rods, and so the flocks
produced young that were striped, speckled, and spotted.
Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped, and completely
black animals in the flock of Laban, and he put his own droves apart, and did not put
them with Laban's flock.
Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob laid in the rods, in the troughs before
the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods, but for the feebler of the
flock, he did not lay them there, so the feebler were Laban's and the stronger Jacob's.
Thus, the man grew exceedingly rich and had large flocks, and male and female slaves,
and camels and donkeys.
Mercury gave to Autolacus, who he begat by Chion, the gift of being such a skillful thief
that he could not be caught, making him able to change whatever he stole into some other form,
from white to black, or from black to white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, from
a horned one to a hornless.
When he kept continually stealing from the herds of Sisyphus, and couldn't be caught,
Sisyphus was convinced he was stealing because Autolacus' number was increasing, while his
growing smaller.
In order to catch him, he put a mark on the hooves of his cattle.
When Autolacus had stolen in his usual way, Sisyphus came to him and identified the cattle
he had stolen by their hooves, and took them away.
While he was delaying there, he seduced Antiklok, the daughter of Autolacus.
She was later given in marriage to Laertes and Borulisces.
Some writers accordingly called him Sisyphian because of his parentage he was shrewd.
Both Apollodorus' library and Aeginos' fables served as essential guides for young Romans,
offering them a foundational understanding of Greek mythology.
These texts preserved the essence of various myths and tragedies,
including tales like Euripides' Frixos.
Jacob's method of increasing his livestock, which involved a seemingly magical process,
mirrors the story of Autolacus and Sisyphus' cattle.
This Greek tale was influenced by the Homeric hymn to Hermes,
where the young god Hermes is depicted stealing Apollo's cattle.
Hermes, interestingly, is Autolacus' father.
The biblical writer used several Greek sources that involved a treacherous father-in-law,
such as the Espios, who made Heracles sleep with 50 different sisters,
Leomedon, who refused to pay horses to Heracles for his work,
and Autolacus, who stole the cattle of Sisyphus.
Though Laban is a deceiver, Jacob will retaliate and prove
that he is an even greater trickster than his father-in-law.
Let's look at this graph of parallels between Jacob and Autolacus.
1. Used magic with animals
Jacob used a magical practice to change the animal's colors
and stripes, growing more livestock than Laban.
Autolacus magically changed the animal's stealing from the herds of Sisyphus.
His dad was Hermes, so he's the greatest trickster of all.
And, of course, two is that they're both tricksters.
Jacob is known for his cunning and trickery in various stories,
as he tricked his father and Esau over and over being a trickster,
similar to how Hermes was.
And then Autolacus is renowned as a master thief and trickster as well.
I do want to highlight, just to make a point about this, that it's absolutely necessary.
And if you look carefully at both of those stories that we told you,
from Hyguinus, Fable, and the Genesis account,
Jacob is talking about striped, speckled animals.
These are animals of black and white, different types of colors
that they're trying to show that he's increasing his fold while Laban's is decreasing.
It's so similar to what we're seeing with Autolacus and how
he is taking Sisyphus' animals.
Literally, both are so close.
It's hard to think that this is really a coincidence.
More likely that the biblical authors, using the Greek tale,
to kind of craft their narrative, as these other scholars,
like Russell Gamerican and others, have been pointing out.
This story was probably written or crafted later
using ancient sources, but the idea of the narrative structure
is gotta be after Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey.
After enduring two decades under Laban's manipulative tactics,
Jacob decides to depart with his family and possessions.
In a twist, Rachel discreetly takes Laban's Terafine,
which are likely small household idols.
When Laban pursues them, demanding his idols back,
Jacob, unaware of Rachel's actions, challenges Laban to find them.
Rachel clearly concels the idols ensuring their escape.
This narrative finds a parallel in the story of David and Michael,
where Michael uses similar tactics to deceive her father Saul and protect David.
Such interconnected tales in the Bible highlight the importance of a reader's patience
and memory to fully grasp the intricate web of stories.
Jacob's subsequent encounter with Esau after a long separation of 20 years
is filled with tension.
One night, Jacob wrestles with an angel,
managing to overcome the celestial being but sustaining a permanent limp in the process.
When he finally meets Esau, they reconcile and divide their inheritance.
Notably, Jacob's limp and Esau's red hair
are motifs that will be echoed in the narrative of David.
Again, Vajambam's point, your memory, if it serves you well,
and you can see the literary connectiveness of these stories,
likely highlights a single mind.
They crafted compiling and connecting these narratives.
Unless one wants to pause it in some way,
a later author looks back or is looking forward
when they compile this literature to connecting these stories.
They're crafting narratives.
I can understand why he thinks single author.
Violated Dina and Helen
In Genesis 34, we encounter a troubling episode where Dina, Jacob's daughter,
is violated by Prince Shechem of the city bearing his name.
In a bid for reconciliation, Jacob agrees to marry Dina to Shechem
and form an alliance with the Shechemites, but only if they undergo circumcision.
However, in a twist of events, Dina's brothers, Simeon and Levi, seeking vengeance for their sister,
exploit the vulnerability of the Shechemites post circumcision and execute a massacre.
This biblical narrative finds a parallel in Greek mythology,
particularly in the story of Helen's abduction.
And when Helen grew into a lovely woman, Thesias carried her off and brought her to
Athenae. But when Thesias was in Hades, Pollux and Caster marched against Athenae,
took the city, got possession of Helen, and led Aethra, the mother of Thesias, away captives.
Further elaborating on this tale, Thesias, in collaboration with Pyretheus,
had previously made a pact to wed daughters of Zeus. In line with this agreement,
Thesias abducts a young Helen for himself. His ambitions don't stop there. He later descends
into Hades, attempting to win Persephone for Pyretheus. In his absence, the deus scori,
with the aid of the Lassidemonians and Arcadians, sees Athens. They not only rescue Helen,
but also take Aethra as a captive. Meanwhile, Menesthes is reinstated as the ruler of Athens
by the deus scori. I want you to check out this graph again, another comparative graph,
paralleling Dina, daughter of Jacob, and Helen of Sparta.
1. Both were defiled by a prince, specifically a prince.
2. Both were taken back by brothers, and specifically two brothers in both accounts.
3. Israel versus the Canaanites, or the Shechemites. Sparta versus Athens,
so you have Israel versus the Canaanites at Shechem, which are like the Pre-Canaanites,
and Sparta versus Athens. 4. Jacob and Euletias's reluctance.
Jacob did not want his sons to attack the Shechemites. Euletias did not want his men to
attack either, and in both cases, they did against their parent, their leader,
telling them what to do, they did the opposite. 5. Attack and capture.
Jacob's sons attacked, killing men and taking women and children captive. In the story, it
specifically says they took men and women captive and attacked. Euletias's men attacked,
killing men and taking women and children captive. Coupitz noticed that Jacob bought a
piece of land in Shechem for a hundred casita. He links this word with the Lydian currency
Cystaphorus, in short, Kyst. That would have given the Hebrew word casita. This would be an
obvious anachronism since that currency did not appear before the late 3rd century BCE.
Coupitz also notices how Simon and Levi used a weapon in Hebrew called makhera.
That sounds exactly like the Homeric Greek, makhera, both meaning a sword,
and so did the Rabbi Rashi. Notice this similarity. In Vashembaum's analysis,
a textual parallel appears with Homer's Odyssey. And the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain
and plundered city because their sister had been defiled. They took their flocks and their herds,
their donkeys and whatever was in the city and in the field, all their wealth, all their little
ones and their wives that was in the houses. They captured and made their prey. There,
I stationed my ships in the river, bidding by men, stay by them and keep guard over them,
while I sent out scouts to reconnoiter from every point of the vantage. But the men disobeyed my
orders, took their own devices and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men and taking
their wives and children captive. Reuben, Hippolytus and Opsalom, a comparative analysis. In the Biblical
narrative while living in the land of Israel, Reuben had an affair with Bilhah, his father's
concubine. This act was not hidden. Israel became aware of it. However, it was only at the end of
his life that Jacob addressed this transgression, reprimanding Reuben and stripping him of his
birthright. Jacob's words to Reuben were both a recognition of his status and a rebuke for his
actions. Reuben, as my eldest son, you were the symbol of my strength and the first sign of my
vitality. You had the highest status, the most power, but you acted impulsively. And because you
violated my bed, you've lost your prominence. Drawing a parallel from Greek mythology,
in Euripides' Hippolytus, Phaedra wrongfully accuses Hippolytus. Theacus' son of violating her.
This accusation is believed by Theacus, especially after Phaedra's suicide and the note she left
behind. The tragic twist is that Phaedra was actually in love with Hippolytus, and her despair
over her unrequited feelings led to her drastic actions. In his anguish and anger, Theacus calls
upon his father, the god Poseidon, to take revenge on Hippolytus, he says.
I can't stay silent about this heinous act, even though it shames me to speak of it. Hippolytus
has disrespected the sanctity of my bed and even the watchful eyes of the gods. Poseidon,
you once promised to grant me three wishes. I invoke one now, and my son's life.
While Hippolytus is portrayed as innocent in Euripides' narrative, Reuben's guilt is clear
in the biblical account. Both stories sharing a striking similarity. A son is accused of violating
his father's marital bed. In Hippolytus' case, he faces a tragic end in a chariot accident,
reminiscent of Absalom's fate in the Bible. Absalom, after violating his father David's
concubines, meets his end when his hair gets entangled in a tree branch during a chariot ride.
Leading to his death at the hands of Joab. This incident comes after Absalom avenges his sister
Tamar, who was violated by their half-brother Abnon. You can see how Jacob's story and David
are connected. Well, this Greek mythology plays the underlying influence to these biblical ones.
Both the Jacob and David narratives in the Bible contain reoccurring themes,
a daughter's violation, her subsequent avengement by her brothers,
and a son's incestual relationship with his father's concubines. In Jacob's final blessings,
in Genesis, Reuben the eldest son is stripped of his birthright due to his transgression.
Similarly, Simeon and Levi, Jacob's next sons face disqualification for their violent retaliation
against the men of Shechem. Ultimately, it's Judah who is prophesied by Jacob to inherit
the leadership mantle of Israel. David, a direct fulfillment of this prophecy, ironically experiences
events mirroring those of his forefather Jacob. This cyclical narrative pattern suggests a single
authorial vision behind these biblical tales. They can be interpreted as theorized by Levi Strauss
in both a linear, diachronic, and a layered, synchronic manner. Genesis, in its essence,
seems to be forward-looking, anticipating the future monarchy of Israel.
This forward-looking perspective is further emphasized when Genesis lists the lineage
of Edom's descendants and its kings, noting that these kings ruled before any king reigned
over the Israelites. I hope you enjoyed the comparisons of Vajambam's parallels in the
Greek stories. Now we'll move to Bruce Loudon.
Homer, Argonauts, and the Old Testament. Bruce Loudon. Dr. Bruce Loudon wrote a great book called
Homer's Odyssey in the Near East, which echoes much of what Dr. Philip Vajambam says about
Greek connections to the Bible. He highlights the significance of the three occurrences of women
at the well being betrothed and how this has parallel significance to Homer's Odyssey,
but how there is a clear influence of the Argonautic myth on Homer as well.
This will bring Jason and Medea into the picture. Odysseus' interactions with Nasechia,
the Fayakian athletes, and her father Alkinos. Intriguingly mirrors what Alter
describes as the betrothal type scene from the Old Testament. Let's first unpack three
prominent Old Testament examples of this narrative pattern and then delve into its parallels
with Odysseus and the Nasechius story. In the Old Testament, Abraham sends a loyal
servant on a mission to find a wife for his son Isaac. The servant stops at a well in Nahor,
a common gathering spot for women. He prays to Yahweh for guidance, asking for a sign.
The woman who offers him water and also waters his camels would be the chosen one.
Enter Rebecca, who fits this description perfectly. After a series of exchanges,
it's revealed that Rebecca is related to Abraham, and she eventually agrees to marry Isaac.
Fast forward and we find Jacob escaping his brother Esau's anger. On a similar quest in Nahor,
at a well he meets Rachel, and after a series of events their relationship blossoms.
Another parallel is seen in Moses' story. Fleeing Egypt, Moses stops by a well in Midian.
He helps the seven daughters of the priest Ruel,
leading to his eventual marriage of one of them, Zipporah.
Now let's look at Odysseus. His meeting with Nasechia by the river echoes these Old Testament
well encounters. Athena in a dream nudges Nasechia to the river, where she's bound to meet Odysseus.
While the Old Testament stories often center on the male perspective,
the Odyssey offers a refreshing change by focusing on Nasechia's viewpoint. The divine
intervention, the emphasis on marriage, and the portrayal of Nasechia's beauty are reminiscent
of the Old Testament tales. In the Odyssey, water locations, be it rivers or wells,
serve as meeting points. While altar suggests wells might symbolize femininity,
both the Odyssey and Old Testament use these water sources as places where foreign men meet
local women. The tasks these women perform, like fetching water or washing, highlight their domestic
virtues. Nasechia's actions the next day, asking her father for a wagon to wash clothes,
hint at her marriage preparations. This mirrors Rebekah's story where her father allows her to
decide her departure. As Nasechia heads to the river, its reminiscent of Rachel and Zipporah's
tales where they tend to their father's animals by the water. The narrative then shifts to Odysseus,
who wakes up startled and naked by the river. As he approaches Nasechia, he is in a vulnerable
state. Unlike the men in the Old Testament stories, his eloquent plea to Nasechia, praising her beauty
and hinting at her future marriage, is unique to the Odyssey but touches on themes present
in the Old Testament. Odysseus' interactions with Nasechia and her people echo a reoccurring pattern,
a narrative pattern seen in the Old Testament. Often termed the quote-unquote
betrothal type scene. Let's break down these parallels for clarity.
In the Old Testament, when Abraham's servants seek a wife for Isaac, he stops at a well in Nahor.
There Rebekah offers him water, a gesture of hospitality and kindness. Similarly, Nasechia
offers Odysseus a bath, a subset of chores women typically perform by the water.
This act of kindness is mirrored in the Old Testament stories,
like when Moses helps Zipporah and her sisters at the well in Midian.
Nasechia's perception of Odysseus evolves after he bathed and dressed. She begins to
see him as a potential husband, expressing a wish that he might stay and become her spouse.
This sentiment of attraction or connection at first meeting is a hallmark of the betrothal
type scene. As the story progresses, Nasechia guides Odysseus towards the city. Along the way,
he prays to Athena, much like Abraham's servant prayed to Yahweh in his quest.
Athena then appears as a young girl with a water pitcher reminiscent of the Old Testament scenes
where young women are encountered at wells. Odysseus' interactions with the Fayakians,
especially the sudden marriage proposal from Alquinos, mirrors Jacob's experiences with Laban
in the Old Testament. Just as Alquinos quickly proposes a union between Odysseus and Nasechia,
similar swift proposals are seen in the Old Testament. Interestingly, while Alquinos'
hasty offer draws criticism, Old Testament characters making similar offers are not judged
as harshly. In essence, Odysseus' journey and encounters with Nasechia and her people are steeped
in narrative patterns reminiscent of the Old Testament's betrothal type scenes.
Jacob and Jason's narratives are enriched by the presence of influential female mentors.
For Jacob, this guiding figure is his mother, Rebecca. She played a pivotal role in shaping
his destiny, especially in counteracting Isaac's preference for Esau. Rebecca masterminds Jacob's
deception of Isaac and Esau and orchestrates his escape from Esau's wrath. Her reassuring words
only obey my voice echo the protective interventions of Hera for Jason.
Just as Hera aids Jason, often in disguise, Rebecca's actions for Jacob are sometimes
attributed to divine intervention as when Jacob credits Yahweh for the quick procurement for
venison. Rebecca's role has striking parallels with Hera, especially when considering another
mythological narrative, that of Heracles in the Iliad Book 19. In this tale, Zeus intends to bestow
blessings upon his favorite son, Heracles. However, Hera cunningly diverts these blessings to her
preferred choice, Eurystheus. The parallels between the two stories are evident. Both
fathers, Isaac and Zeus inadvertently misdirect their blessings due to the machinations of their
wives, Rebecca and Hera. The intended recipients, Esau and Heracles, share several characteristics
both are portrayed as heroic figures, hunters, and are notably her suit. Esau's description in
particularly aligns with the characteristics often associated with Heracles. Despite their prowess
and their father's favor, both end up subservient to the chosen ones of their mothers or stepmothers.
My personal note is I think maybe both of these narratives were influenced by the earlier Gilgamesh
hero, but that's a side note. Laban and Ateez are both tricky dads in old stories. They make the
main characters Jacob and Jason jump through hoops before they can marry their daughters.
Here's the scoop. Rebecca, Jacob's mom, wanted him to stay with Laban, her brother,
for just a short while, but between trying to avoid his angry brother, Esau, and wanting to
marry Laban's daughter, Rachel, Jacob ends up staying much longer. Why? Because Laban keeps
changing the rules. First, he makes Jacob work for seven years to marry Rachel, but after these
years, Laban tricks Jacob and gives him his older daughter, Leah, instead. This sneaky move is a bit
like what Leomedon, a king from another story, did when he didn't pay two gods after they did a job
for him. Ateez, from the Jason story, is also a tricky dad. He sets terms for Jason, but then
doesn't stick to them. When Jason first meets Ateez, he talks about another sneaky guy, Pilius.
Jason basically went from dealing with one difficult person, Pilius, to another Ateez. Both
Jacob and Jason had problems at home and then faced more problems with the fathers of the
women they wanted to marry. To sum it up, both these dads, Laban and Ateez, remind us of a
description of Pilius from an old poem. They're both pretty sly and challenging.
For I give over to you the sheep, the tawny herds of cattle, and all the fields which you stole
from my parents had administered to fatten your wealth. I do not mind these overly enriched
your house. Kind of surmising a lot of chapter six from Dr. Bruce Loudon's work.
Number one, Laban and Ateez. Laban and Ateez are portrayed as devious fathers of the protagonists
loved interest. Their characters are characterized by deceit and manipulation. Laban's pursuit of
Jacob is aggressive and threatening. His sons who accompany him express a hostile attitude towards
Jacob. This mirrors Obstorto's pursuit on behalf of Ateez in the Argonautica. Obstorto, Ateez's son,
is depicted as holding the reins of Helios' chariot, emphasizing his ability to pursue.
He leads a group of Colchians to chase after Jason, who has taken Ateez's fleece.
Similarly, Laban pursues Jacob, who has taken his household gods. Laban's treatment of Jacob
is reminiscent of Ateez's behavior towards Jason. Both protagonists face challenges imposed by
these father figures. For instance, Jacob has to work for several years due to Laban's cunning,
just as Jason has to undertake labors specified by Ateez.
Two, Obstorto and Laban's pursuit. Obstorto, representing Ateez, pursues the protagonist
as they flee with valuable items. His ability to chase is hinted at in scenes where he controls
Helios' chariot. Laban, on the other hand, overtakes Jacob in a landlocked parallel. This
pursuit is intensified by the aggressive stance of Laban's sons. Obstorto, leading a group of Colchians,
outmaneuvers Jason, trapping him where the River Easter separates around a group of islands.
In a similar vein, Laban overtakes Jacob, camping opposite him in Gilead. The chapter also touches
upon the aggressive nature of Rachel, who stills Laban's household gods. This act is paralleled
with Medea's role in the Argonautica, where she plays a significant part in the theft of the Golden
Fleece. Three, Jason's confrontation with Esau. Jason's confrontation in the Argonautica are
paralleled with Jacob's anticipated violent encounter with his brother Esau. However,
while Jason faces multiple confrontations, Jacob's narrative culminates in reconciliation.
Medea's magic and Rachel's desire for offspring. Medea's use of Prometheon,
or Prometheus, drug is a significant aspect of the Argonautica. The plant's root, which resembles
quote, newly cut flesh, in quote, plays a pivotal role in the narrative. In the Old Testament,
Rachel's desire for offspring from Jacob mirrors Medea's magical endeavors, though the methods
differ. But she said to her, wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my
son's mandrakes too? Very well, Rachel said. He can sleep with you tonight and return for your
son's mandrakes. Though Rachel is not a witch, as is Medea, magic is present, even prominent,
in her myth. Unable to bear children, when she learns that Leah's first son Reuben has found
some mandrakes, Rachel asks if she may use them, presumably as an aphrodisiac. In Apollonius' account,
a love charm in the form of Eros' agency is the central means of assuring Medea will unite
with Jason. In Jacob's myth, Rachel, already married to Jacob, seizes upon a similar agent
to obtain offspring from him. Apollonius' key depiction of Medea's magic describes her use
of the Promethean drug.
Son of Israel, Judah, then the Dreamer. So many examples pile up. After a while, you're left
with no choice but to seriously dive into the Greek world for the biblical narrative sources.
In our next installment, we will dive into the Son of Israel, Judah, and then Joseph,
the favorite son of Jacob, aka Israel, and the child of Israel's favorite wife, Rachel.

We could really use your support to continue these documentaries, bringing this information

there that is doing what I'm doing with this series. You have to hunt and find this material
deep, deep down in literature, and nobody is taking it into MP4 content where it is being
expressed in this manner. I wish there were videos out there like this. In fact, I started
MythVision for that sole purpose. I saw a lack of certain content that I was enjoying and wanting
that was in books that I've read, and nobody had performed videos on them. Here I am,
doing that with this series. Please help back us, support what we're doing,
join us. It helps us commit to doing this kind of work. I plan on doing this all the way through
the entire Bible and into the New Testament. I also hope to get into Islam, the Koran,
my whole goal is to bring you that mythological angle that you don't find out there very often.
Until next time, we are MythVision.
