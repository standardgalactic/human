the origin of Yahweh if we pronounce it like that, the topic with a long history.
There couldn't be a divine king before humans had monarchies. There couldn't be a deity, let's say,
flaming sword before humans used swords, otherwise they wouldn't have that idea.
One of these gods was Yahweh and in different communities he had different associations.
Some he had a female counterpart like Asherah as Baal also had and in others
there is no such obvious connection. In some places he was just worshipped as Yel or identified as Yel.
In others you have Yahweh of Samaria, Yahweh of Jerusalem with its own history associated with
deity they which was then before the history of Judah. Where is the obvious and greatest
idea that the deity which the word like Yahweh like also the word Yel or Elim, that can be
both solar and it can also be more geological. I mean people already you can just look up on the
internet from the storm out of the volcano and you'll see what it actually looks like and there are
there's not ever a volcano that has been recently active around there. The people thinks that
it's Sinai but there is no doubt that the people were familiar with some volcanic imagery.
We are MythVision. Welcome back to MythVision podcast. I have a wonderful scholar joining
me today who's written many books but let me get his name out of the way so that we can properly
address who he is. His name is Yaku Garrick or Gettick. It's like Yahu or Yahweh you know it's
got the same kind of gist to it but it's like Jacob you know and spelled kind of like you would go
with Jacob but welcome to MythVision. How are you Dr. Gettick? I'm okay thanks and how are you?
I'm good. I came across your work actually a couple friends of mine on my Patreon were like
you really need to talk to this gentleman because he knows a lot about God especially Yahweh.
I figure I'd start real quick just to let everybody know in the description he has a website
and I want everyone also to know he's associate professor of theology and philosophy at Northwest
University in South Africa. He is the author of What is a God? Philosophical Perspectives on
Divine Essence in the Hebrew Bible Bloomsbury and the Hebrew Bible and Philosophy of Religion.
You just published one in 2020 and that uh we get to that one here that one nice specifically a
philosophical theology of the Old Testament that one was caught my eye and so um I'm really
interested in diving into this as well and then you have an older version does this older version
the Hebrew Bible and Philosophy of Religion kind of do somewhat what the new one does but the new
one goes into more detail or? Well yes um well the other one the first one was like a introduction
on possibilities for Hebrew Bible scholars to work with Philosophy of Religion um that mainly my
background is in Semitic languages and the Old Testament and um I try to find new ways
that um Philosophy of and Philosophy of Religion can be used to understand ancient specifically
conceptions of divinity and so um that one that the SPL Society of Public Literature was
like a first attempt to outline the new methodological proposals um whereas
um well so that one has all the basic um things of Philosophy of Religion and Religious Language
Religious Epistemology, Nature and Attributes of of Yahweh and so and existence but the whole
thing was not to it was to do a sort of impossible mix up where you if you don't focus on
contemporary Philosophy of Religion you simply use it as a tool to see what is assumed in the
Old Testament about the nature of religious language or the nature and attributes of Yahweh
even though it wasn't intended for that whether this can be reconstructed also if regards to
the existence of the divine um are there is any implicit details in the text that sort of
gives away what made them think that such an entity is there even though there are no
philosophical arguments so this was the first attempt to reintroduce Philosophy into Old Testament
Studies after it fell into disrepute for good reasons and for a long part of history I just
thought there are descriptive tools where you can analyze ancient conceptions of the divine
without arguing um a projectically for it or apiologically against it just to clarify
just because it's not philosophy to clarify it in philosophical terms so the new the new one
is is basically there's often a distinction between Philosophy of Religion and
philosophical theology in the analytic philosophy world in a certain way where
philosophical theology is more just focused on the conception of the specific
religious traditions deity so this one was more focused on the new one was more focused on
the nature and attributes of Yahweh in different contexts exactly again because the Old Testament
is not philosophical theology but instead of the older way of trying to harmonize it with
say Christian or Jewish philosophical theology once again this was an attempt at using philosophical
theology as a tool for conceptual analysis to to understand um what um the Old Testament in this
case they distinguished between Old Testament and Hebrew Bible um what it assumed about the nature
and attributes of Yahweh not so much as of divinity per se whereas in the the first one the focus was
more on conceptions of the divine generically and even the second book was about the scholarly question
well what is a god so in the second book the focus was still generic
because Yahweh is called a god so that's like a classification of a type of
species in a cosmic hierarchy so God is a god so so in the second book it was more focused on
what is understood by this question of what a god is that is being asked in scholarship
if you look at it from specific philosophical perspectives so he didn't answer the question
it actually analyzed different ways that what this question can mean and the third one was
the final one where the focus is only on the specific god and an attempt at philosophical
theological clarification sort of an extension of Old Testament theology but not as part of
the Christian agenda or atheist agenda more purely historical interest and if that makes
sense no makes perfect sense and I want everybody to know also before we get off the intro he has
an academia page I have an academia page go follow him go check out his work he's done a lot here
so he's written articles I've had scholarly friends mention your works and they think you are
very funny as well and you're writing so they enjoy what you say also I have the patreon of
course I'm letting those who know who are patreon members you're watching this early and everyone
else has got to wait and so I really appreciate your support I'm also going live of course later
but please consider helping support us I do a lot of scholarly interviews and we love getting into
these questions and diving in deep because we want to know just like you said Dr. Garrick that
I want to know what the truth of the matter is and I'm not saying because like personally I
identify as an atheist I'm not against this literature I actually love the Bible I love
the New Testament I love the Bible I love finding out you know what sources may have been used to
develop some of this literature finding out for example that the flood may come from an older
mess of itamian like getting into that finding out Moses's story probably comes from other
religious traditions or Jonah with Oh Ones or Dagon like with these influences where's the
source I love this stuff and yes part of me gets a joy out of finding out that modern apologetics
are completely off track now it's their agenda but I do have a motive of trying to show
their conception of God is modern and they want to anachronistically project the God of the Hebrew
Bible to this omnibenevolent outside space and time deity when this is in an ancient Near Eastern
context and I can't imagine that they thought this way especially before Plato I just can't see
anyone thinking of something beyond what was in the air and what was going on at the time so
real quick question before we get started do you know Francesca Francesca Stavrakapulu God
and anatomy she wrote a book I saw that one I haven't read it yet no it's all about God's
corporeal body like the physical body of God but that's a popular topic in the field as well
yes several scholars have written on that and it comes from an interest in embodiment in various
forms of biblical scholarship so but thank you I haven't read it but oh so thanks it kind of goes
in the vein I think of what might be discussed today and I guess I'll start with a common question
of your book what is a God and then we're going to get into Yahweh specifically you might bring
up the development from L to Yahweh whatever you want to do I'll follow your lead so if you could
take us off okay um well since you mentioned the origin of um Yahweh if we pronounce it like that um
this is a topic with a long history so what I always like to tell people is
every question itself doesn't just arise out of thin air um questions of origins of deities
go back to go back to the ancient world so you already had ancient in ancient mess you have
stories of origin of the gods but they are not purely historical questions so the question of the
origin of um Yahweh and Yahvism and this should be distinguished and I'll come to this soon
can like the question what is a God it can be interpreted in different ways okay so
um let me say it like this in um biblical scholarship there is no
pure reading of the text it's not like the analogy of you are reading a letter or a newspaper where
you just read and you know the conventions so especially in academia um you are always using
a method now there are several approaches in in biblical studies and for example a basic one
is a linguistic approach now if you ask the question about the origins of Yahweh and you use
a linguistic approach there are several things that scholars focus on most to ask this question
about a holistic approach so they incorporate several methods but one of the
topics that come up in the origin of um Yahweh is the question of the name
and the language behind it so of course linguistics is more than simply a question of grammar or
semantics or um pragmatics and and so on so it's such a rich field and there are so many
sub methods but what I can say is one way scholars have tried to answer this question
of the origin of Yahweh was by trying to analyze the word and see if you look at it
from the perspective of the language family uh northwest Semitic and what does this mean now
there's a bit of at the forefront of research in any field it's a running debate and nothing
is really fixed it's just a scientific spirit not because because it's wishy washy but because
everything is left open for reconsideration so what you find in um for example some linguistic
answers to this question is that um the name itself as you know it's not Jehovah that is a
later reading where the vowels of other nine was read back into the Hebrew
constant so that is a later interpretation but
it's often the name doesn't really give us the origin because a conception of a God
goes further than just the name the name is important it gives you an idea of okay if the
name is in Hebrew and the name possibly means this and this or that which will come to it means
that it couldn't come before people spoke Hebrew right so there are certain things about the language
of a text or in a way a deity is described the technology they use um the political system that
the cosmos looks like that sort of gives the game away that it couldn't be before this um it couldn't
be a divine king before humans had monarchies um there couldn't be a deity let's say a flaming
sword before the humans use swords otherwise they wouldn't have that idea now one might think okay
why is this a problem and it is not necessarily a problem but the thing is suppose you use the
history of weapons and you think of there's a time when different cultures use certain weapons
even before the homo sapiens and so something like a sword or a spear as a history so when a
certain word is used for a specific type of weapon or even say a chariot or certain clothes the deity
is presented as or not to mention speaking Hebrew but of course there's ways around that
um it's sort of the the technomorphism or the form of the technology gives the game away
of roughly before when this could not have been thought of so what you would have is for example
in um in some texts where um the divine is pictured as um in certain ways as with uh like in Genesis
9 where the word for the rainbow is that reaches the bow which is the deity put in the clouds after
the flood which is um so the rainbow is like this bow and the lightning is like the arrows
part of their storm and but the bow and the arrows have a history in human weaponry so
that doesn't come point at all but it gives it sort of tells you when um some of the origins
of these images and the actual time of the composition may be later and you see the same
other approaches to the language we um not only does the deity speak in the form of Hebrew
what he refers to um the way the deity refers to parts of nature the words he uses for clouds
the words he uses for his own abode if it's a palace or which is the same word as temple
then there's a certain political they would say metaphor but you can also say sociomorphism
like it's a projection of some human political system on the cosmos it is an analogy like the
capital building someone might say that they go well that had to be around the time the United
States had a capital um you know so it'd be kind of like that right yes so in actually what the deity
was like very much like the white house it was the temple was a place where it's the it's it's the
upper upper class like the central of the town the the building of the um the highest ranking
official in in town and um this is such a complex question about the origin so if we if we if we
just look at to some this part up if we look at the language in which the deity is used to describe
as when he makes an appearance as part of a theophany if there's elements and not only certain
elements of certain beliefs also certain ways of thinking certain morality a certain certain
views of society certain ways of referring to humans and to himself um and just to go back
to the swords and the flaming swords and genesis um two so three sorry um that sort of gives a game
away of when these stories were told now um to come back to your question most scholars try to
deduce the origin of your way from imagery used when the deity appears as a character in narratives
and this links up to the literally critical um approach to the text where the deity is a character
in a story whatever else you believe or don't believe in the world of the text which is usually
distinguished from the world behind the text so the world behind the text is literally the the
messy religions of ancient as well as you would have christianity today you would have official
religious text but you would also have religion on the ground so when i speak of the origin of
your way or imagery in the bible i'm not yet talking about the origin of israeli religion
which is a separate thing you can't equate stories in text with the world behind it okay so
many scholars have tried to identify the origin by looking at the imagery present when the deity
appears so when the deity appears on cyanide in a storm or these references to to to storm imagery
this was used to think of when there were storm gods and when when people had certain views of
meteorology so you can almost look at the history of this concept of the deity as associated with
the storm as a warrior and as a king and every one of these ideas in human the history of ideas
have history so that's how you trace the origin of imagery okay so back to the origin of the name
one interpretation of the origin of the name is if you if you this word is ambiguous you are
aware and so it could mean several things it could it's not i am that i am but it could mean
in it's depending on the Hebrew if you use or the form of the word it could mean anything from
you causes to be or you will be what you will be but not in the philosophical sense or you
you is but again not in the philosophical sense or you is shows himself to be what he will be or
even up to right to it's none of your business so i am what i am so i'm not gonna ask answer your
question are this interpreted with you who falls or the the imagery of liking falling so
in terms of the origins many associate the origins of the deity with not in the of the
segment of the revival but in the ancient world with storm deity imagery and of the
Sinai or the the peninsular the Arabian Peninsula and this is where things get complicated because
and just stop me if you want to ask but we have to remember certain things come before certain
other things yeah we could not be called the god or classified as a god before people have
conceptions of gods you have to remember that ilawim or the word translated as god with the
capitalism is also used in a generic sense as Yahweh is a never been he is a god so it's the type of
being is it or it's the species if you want to call it or them so then the question is
what what kind of god um Yahweh is in a given takes and that usually helps scholars to trace
the origin of that imagery real quick just to just for our audience if i may just to point out
this helps with the terminus ad quim ad quo so so everything that you've described up to this
point from linguistics to political to cultural to storm deity when we're storm gods prevalent
where were they prevalent etc the language everything matters to letting you know the
earliest pretty much of when these things could be that we know from contemporary examples to
the latest that this would have been used gives us an idea of where this god would have originated
in right yes and because there was no centralized systematic theology of dogma
different communities have different views of Yahweh and many especially in the pre-exilic
period before the sixth century didn't worship Yahweh alone so there's a reason why Yahweh is also
called an Elohim as if he was one of many even if monotheism or the belief in one god was later
developed um because this storm god imagery is very similar to imagery of Baal in the um
in the uberritic it's a word for canaanite or syria palestine um the other context
it's it's much the same injury imagery as you would find of storm deities in the northwest
Semitic world of the Arabian peninsula and north up to Syria so some of the ancient myths um there's
traces of this in the old testament mention Yahweh as um one of the um what you would call sons of
eel um in Genesis the predominant word for Yahweh or the older word is um often eel which is um not
the same as Elohim which is the plural of Hebrew um for gods which is was later used as a singular
for Yahweh to as a amalgamation of all the deities so there are traces in certain texts that that are
not visible always in the translation um like in Deuteronomy 30 30 2 or 3 and 30 and 32 um sorry um
just tired of it and uh and you see in other texts residues of it in Psalm 82 um even Psalm 58 um
um and otherwise where Israel is said to be Yahweh's inheritance so which means that there's the
father of the gods the most high El El Yun like in Genesis 14 and then Yahweh is like was one of the
like all one of the sons of eel and this obviously later became a problem which was later
um solved by emerging conceptions of eel that the father figure in the deity the figure of the deity
as an infront king infront on the waters that comes from the Canaanite or Uluritic um eel stories
the father of the gods many traces of that in Genesis in the Psalms and elsewhere in many
poems in our testament um so you can see why answering the question of origins is very difficult
because um it's not just the case of a singular origin of a singular conception with one line
so most traces of this yes no i was just going to say this i i could see how someone would really
stumble over what you were mentioning about Elohim and and uh being plural than being singular and
and i think that's the problem with people like me i don't know language right i don't know the
language and it's a diachronic approach you know christine haze and other academics they talk
about this they're like the meaning of words that change over time and the same thing happens with
the word like ethne uh ethnos the gen tiles that changes from generic use and genesis to just mean
any nation anywhere anytime uh political you know entities to later on individual singular people
you know and so i think it's interesting what you're saying if i could be direct maybe as you're
developing this um what is as far as Yahweh the name for that specific god what would be the the
oldest i think that's terminus ad quim i think i might have a backwards quote i think it's quim
but the oldest that we can put that name for that god that we could that we're aware of
okay again this question has a few different answers um the one is if you're asking it in
the context of archaeology um and if you leave the Bible out of it if you're just going to look at
the material culture um some findings and even there it's controversial and interpretation you have um
um texts um or references um in like the mannefta stale and in from the egyptian um
there's a late second millennium although the dating is sometimes debated and even the presence
of the name there is debated because um it refers to a shashu tribe and the the egyptian use there
and the name is it's disputable whether that is actually refers to Yahweh and or whether it's
maybe a shortened form because there are in the old system itself as you see in the word like that
you know like hallelujah where there's just the yah at the end of the word that part of the name
in some place there's a in many personal names like um Elijah which is in Hebrew actually Eliyahu
which means Eliyus my god and Yahu is a form of this name like the internet um Yahu but in this case
so depending on on on how you think of this some scholars have thought this was early evidence others
looked to the uberitic um text where they thought they could identify the name as one of the sons
in the lists of gods and some archaeological evidence come from the early first millennium bc
which means the first half 900 or 800 700 right up to 600 before what they call the exile so um
there are ideas that a god of Yahweh was worshiped and this is again different in Israel which was
for a long time the northern kingdom and Judah the southern kingdom and so this name Israel which was
the northern kingdom usually people have a name of their gods um especially like the story of Jacob
so but the fact that Israel as well as this eel at the end well if you're a conservative scholar
you're gonna say it just refers to god you trust god but that eel um it's usually a personal name
in the context of a people and in the northern part closer to uberit um the worship of the god
Yahu or Elu or however you pronounce it was there when this is again a complex answer when other
people began to migrate into the area so even in the Old Testament in the names of many individuals
um also from the northern kingdom in some of the names of um what you would call god that people
in church would like to say all the names of god in the Old Testament but there's no historical
consciousness yet because if you read the word god in the Old Testament people bring all the baggage
of the associative meaning of this perfect being these characteristics and um that is just this
one god and it's the same as the god they know so but most of the references to eel awaits a personal
name in the earlier parts of the Old Testament and not to be confused with necessarily genesis one
which is later than say genesis two but and also um these eels um like um eel shall die and things
like should die also has different interpretations or eel alum which means refers to time or not
eternity in the popular sense all these were names of local deities so what you have in the
ancient world behind the text um not in the stories is a world where different communities have
different gods or many gods one of these gods was Yahweh and in different communities he had
different associations and some he had a female counterpart like um Asherah as Baal also had
um and in others um there is no such obvious connection in some places he was just worshiped
as eel or identified as eel in others you have Yahweh of Samaria Yahweh of Jerusalem with its own
history associated with Deity they which was the before the history of Judah and so um and the name
Salim in Jerusalem um is usually associated with a specific um older deity that was there so
just historically this thing is so complex as you said and develops over time that even this
name Yahweh over time um it's impossible to pinpoint exactly the oldest occurrence of this name
the Old Testament has some in the text has a few
divergent traditions that remind in the rest of the story so you have in Genesis
and four you would have this reference to that the people began to for 26 that the people began
to call on the name of Yahweh which then in Exodus um uh six you and also in three that this idea
was that Yahweh that God was not known as Yahweh to the patriarchs because this magical eel into
for Abraham Isaac and Jacob um so um we were we're not actually related in but that's a different
story um so what you have here is um sorry I was saying the documentary hypothesis there
that would be a breaking source yeah that is also being modified as to what remains
very mostly um the Duteron domestic traditions remain but some things like the Eloist or the
even the Yahweh's depending whether it's some American scholarship or European or way
these are constantly modified and right most mainstream historical critics don't speak so much
of the Eloist anymore at all um or um it doesn't mean that the problem that the documentary hypothesis
identified is not there it's still there you still have these different things it's just that the
older explanation of the Yahweh's as an author or the Elohim author in the 21st century this
is being modified um so it doesn't go back to a conservative view it's actually more complicated
so so what you have there the Old Testament then has this association with Moses that the name was
first made known to Moses and explained in Exodus 6 and so um and there you have the tradition of
Moses in Midian which is another um part of the story of scholarship on origin the so-called
Midianite hypothesis where if you look at the story of Moses he goes from Egypt into the desert
and then he meets um a man there and became a fulbran law but he was already worshiping Yahweh
and in other texts if you look at the way that it's like let's do the Midianites in some texts
um or the keynotes even um there this means that the origin of Yahweh lies south of Palestine
in the desert um and even Sinai the mountain is not with the monasteries currently um the exact
location is not known but most theories of the origin of Yahweh as a storm deity sees him as a
a god a mountain god um which in all the theories was anything from a personified volcano which
people superstitiously misinterpreted right up to later views where you find storm and um
fertility and um warrior imagery or in one in this appearance of this god but there are poems
in the Old Testament and other texts which refers to Yahweh as coming from the south which some theories
have interpreted the origin of Yahweh is not in Israel or even with those people or with Moses
it lies with other peoples outside of Israel so um that depending on where you make this
entry into history and what part of the imagery you use um we it's often traced back and also
acknowledged by the Old Testament in some texts to come from the south so
historically um a deity with a mountain um and that you find like in Exodus and so on and a lot
of that imagery um one has to one cannot generalize this all the imagery there but the text we have
it and the theologies that were built in to the left of time so in a singular text um like the
10 commandments of which are different versions and in different context where this you find this
mountain deity you have so many different imageries because what we have in the text ultimately
is when scraps from later times um and there was no canon and so on and there were these texts
when they reworked these and um combined them and different communities have different texts and
scrolls you find that um new theologies were incorporated so the deity is almost like you
as you relate to your ancestors genetically you have genes from a lot background say if I ask
what makes Derek the origin of Derek Lambert you can say your mother and father but if you
ask the question genetically if you ask it um socially or culturally if you asked it in other
ways um depending on where you make the historical artificial cut off say your ancestors immigrated
from Europe or um and uh you come from this um gene um line of a genetic ancestry or um your name
say this so I cannot I can probably tell from your name maybe more surname some of your ancestry
and sometimes it's misleading but um but it's also the ancestry up to a point up to a certain point
when people had surnames so up to a certain point where gods were anthropomorphic where where gods were
this kind of gods because early gods were not creators and early gods were not city dwellers
so when when Yahweh is this nomadic god who lives on a mountain and those images are older than
Yahweh as a king thrown in Jerusalem which is a whole different theology and the origin of that
theology as its own history so long story short um answering the question of origins
usually depending on whether you're interested in the question of the language
just literature history origin social origins you can ask it even psychologically um why did
people think um or believe this from a psychological perspective and or politically or and so there are
all these entries into this question um and even theologically um so depending on where you come
from there are all these answers and everyone is complete this this is a very yeah this is
it seems to me ultimately we don't know for certain any of this but there are good leads to maybe
give us some um ideas about this and there are some things we do know and some of those things
are like you talked about some of the stuff is later theology a later idea of god god is now
a throne on a throne is a king with a whole community of other people around him etc um
and you know i have questions that i'd love to know the answer to i don't think we will but
you know it makes me wonder if you go far enough back in Yahweh worship outside of the bible like
what god was before them just like when we see with the like Anzuber in the midst that are in
Mesopotamia eventually Marduk comes on the scene and then he takes over and it makes me wonder if
they had some form of polytheism like that i i don't know but it it is polytheistic and this
is the thing i i think most people don't get is at one point when you go far enough back you'll
find that these religions they're mini gods it's not like a single monotheistic god um
yes so so i just want to say they um everything before the sixth century BCE
was very likely even in ancient Ezra and Judah was very likely polytheistic um
and what they would call is what they would say is um also polytheistic so there were different
centers of worship of Yahweh and there are different um traditions of him and his story
and so also with regard to uh conceptions if you come in from philosophical perspectives
you can say that there are some things you can conceptually take back before Yahweh was even
a new entry because Yahweh is a very light deity a very young deity in historical terms
i mean we we have nothing older concretely older than 3000 years of this name and even other
words like Elohim or someone because um these languages and their scripts didn't exist before
certain time they also was no possibility of a certain conception of the divine so as what if
there is imagery of uh solar imagery or of the stars or you can trace it back to early human
conceptions like David Hume and you can see the these or other philosophers have done and you can
see origins of certain forms of worship that became more sophisticated but was originally
associated with natural phenomena or social phenomena or people um but it's it's completely
lost to us we only have traces but these traces gives us concrete hints of not so much the diet
of origin of the imagery but of the kind of imagery and whether it's um astronomical or meteorological
or associated with uh um say uh certain political uh types of um say types or certain social structures
these tells us when this topic imagery couldn't be before this so origins um
is is can be answered um but not in a way people precipize like saying oh the origin of Yahweh
is in one two three four five bc and from this this this and this because because the conception of
the divine involved every time you are going to have to be specific of which this view of Yahweh
you're referring to what part of that imagery you're referring to and whether you want to know
the origin of the imagery which cannot always be associated just with Yahweh or the origin of when
people as far as we know um in ancient Israel when Judah might be Judah um when we are with
and uh in the Persian period we can try something lighter was used so again complicated it is
complicated if i were going to have you guess because you're you know experts are very careful
about making assumptions and i can tell that you're very cautious you don't want to say this and be
wrong or that but if i were to have you guess just to put a guess what century would you say Yahweh
appears in in the Israelite religion or period i don't know yeah okay so i'll answer this quickly um
as you want but just first say also again as with Christianity there's no Christianity there's
forms of Christianity and so there was no there are many Israelite religions in the plural a very
good introduction to this would be Zionist David's book um 2003 and Zionist David wrote a book on
Israelite religions a history of parasitic approaches and it's a it's a very good summary
of scholarship on that from the history of religion archaeology and so on um
and a more recent book um that i would recommend to the public to answer your question
that also summarized this as courses and clear as possible that better than i've done now
is a french scholar but it's in English the book translated it's thomas rumour
thomas rumour and the invention of god you can just google the invention of god by thomas
r o with two dots and then um mer he wrote the invention of god as a way to educate the public
and this really is the latest of forefront scholarship with archaeology theology and all
the questions you're out of the name and these are answered as cautiously and clearly as possible
in this book the invention of god summarizing the scholarship and showing what we can and cannot
know but if i was to say um when Yahweh first appeared in Israel what we do know is that
the first people who worshiped Yahweh was not the people of Israel and what we do know was
that when Yahweh appeared in Israel he wasn't the only deity and he didn't only appeared in
what was called Israel and what was meant by as well there was a people i have to say listen you
know i want to say something this is amazing because i know what you're saying and it's very
difficult trying to break this down because when you say israel like what do you mean do you mean
northern kingdom is this anachronistic there's so many layers i love what you're saying because
it tells you how much research you have to dig to get everything you're saying to lead to this
point but please continue i love this you know so we know that Yahweh became the official of the
most high-ranking deity um even when there was polytheism um the state apparatus and so Yahweh
was one if he had a consul a female consul he was still primary deity at the late point in
israel earlier maybe ill but but the theology was um the god ill and even ball is still present in
the names of people even of the kings of ancient israelan juda even before the the splitting of
the kingdom so even some of david's sons um you have the the rabbinic translation of
the Hebrew of shame or otherwise of poset but some of king david's
list of his sons and whether you see this is historical or not um the name actually still has
the word ball and of course ball was not just the deity the word ball could also mean a lord or
husband because ball just basically means lord or that the English translation of lord comes from
Hebrew i don't know which is the translation of Yahweh the name Yahweh throughout the English Bible
and they never just say so every time you read the lord and the testament it's usually Yahweh but
the word ball uh wife called the husband her ball you see this but so the older names or
ill and ball and they which is typically up the area so
when exactly Yahweh first appeared is not the same as when he was first worshiped and when
he was first worshiped is not the same as when he was the highest ranking worshiped and even then
some communities did it and some didn't or was alone or it wasn't and he had certain characteristics
in some contexts and in others he was already mixed with deities um solar deities and depending on
the um ancient israelan Judah were very small kingdoms so as soon as egypt or the Babylonians
or the assyrians or the persians or the Greeks um took over the area and the empire there was
immediately and not immediately but eventually over time and they tend to say well our deity which
was not originally Yahweh but Yahweh later that our deity is the Elohim is all these gods um and
whatever they could do they of course had left some things out but they to say that Yahweh is Elohim
like plural to say that in Yahweh all the gods are joined so what you have an earlier time is
is part of what they call a pantheon or family that you have you're at the top you have Yahweh
or all and others and their wives and then other minor deities um like rechef or pestilence or um
these in lighter tradition you would have Yahweh greater than the gods and then on the top and
then you would have angels which is not seraphim or cherubim or what you would call angel these are
the malach or the malachim and they are messengers um later that became part of this several of the
armies um of this deity the heavenly armies and also like when god was a deity of the mountain
he wasn't yet the sky god so a god of the heavens and earth and the idea of Yahweh creating the
heavens and earth was not it's not the earliest view the earlier view is this nomadic deity of
mountain with stormy nature a lighted deity that the time when he became this cosmic king
that created everything is only possible when there were empires and and one empire ruled and
all their gods and religions was included only then could malachism developed and people could
have an idea that one must be corrected in all other gods would that would that put it around um
syria or would you say at least syria that's the earliest right wouldn't we say
yeah the empire um um some would say monotheism or monotheistic tendencies or what could we call
monotheism and notes that like in the commandments you shouldn't worship other gods i'm jealous of
other gods which means that there are other gods but don't worship them or or we are they're fighting
against the gods like exodus 1212 where he fought against the gods of Egypt so there are all these
residues of other imagery and yes so i would say you have monotheistic tendencies in the seventh
century and is where the syrian empire um but even then and even later on the ground
though you had a rare um monotheistic phase um in egyptian religion a lot earlier um with uh
a certain thing or in the second millennium in the akhenaten yes and you can see also why
you would think that so if you look at the sky just from a naturalistic point of view
the sun and the stars because they didn't know stars were suns and you look at the stars you
look at the sun the sun is completely dominating the sky so this idea of a light or a power greater
than all the others um and as its origin in solar imagery and and so when the sun deity and all the
complex um and look this was really highly sophisticated theology with different like
the trinity you have just as sophisticated concepts of ancient deities with of marguc and his
fifty names or um different forms of the sun god these are not so primitive and
superstitious as or sometimes mighty altestinal just as sophisticated as the altestinal could be
in its its deity that couldn't be seen or the altestinal is seen all these other religions had
equally sophisticated theologies that are just caricatureized in the altestinal yeah yeah that
that happens a lot let me ask you this you mentioned solar imagery uh when i was um leaving the
fundamentalist community that i was part of that tells you how to read it what to look at you know
if you don't read the west minister confession of faith you know that kind of stuff when i left
i looked at samson uh again and i was listening to a person who was discussing this that samson
is actually a solar uh the imagery is that samson is a maybe allegorized form or some
anthropomorphized story i don't know what the term you would want to put on it but he is like the sun
with seven locks because there's seven days to a week um and his hair or the days of the week are
cut off meaning it's probably and this is guessing interpreting the text it's probably the sun going
into the winter solstice which is another reason why they gouge out his eyes so he cannot see
which is darkness so the sun is going into darkness losing his strength um delilah sells
him for silver which might be a symbol for the moon i don't know and the 30 there was the riddle
with the 30 um days they had which is which is obviously a lunar calendar if i'm not mistaken
or it's it's and so this seems to be an image of old solar lunar battle what what are your
thoughts on that yes um in the 19th century especially when when the ancient eastern cultures were
assimilated into scholarship um there was always a thing to link it with especially astral religion
in Babylonia and so on and because the the the cuneiform sign for deity the the pacifized
deities is a star and the association of deities with astronomical imagery um this was one of the
ways in which minnetics were interpreted which has a good foundation but it's it's a bit temperate
these days so in terms of samsung it's undeniable that there are links although it's it's not so
these links have been a bit there are so many links that you have some of you have mentioned
like shemin the word samsung is literally the the mini to form of the word shemish so it means little
well you have the seven yes the rays of the sun the lila which is a reminder of
lila in Hebrew is also the word for night okay so and he's in his cave he pulls down the pillars
of this cosmic it everything you said about that that is all being the story it it's a rich story
now what you see there for samsung is in a way also done for solar deities but you have to remember
Yahweh as time goes on he's incorporating more of different deities into himself so initially this
nomadic tribal deity of the mountain likely storm god not yet the king
god of the desert of a certain area not the cosmic god not a creator god god of a certain tribe or
tribes eventually this god as he's being worshiped in different contexts takes on imagery of the
high god um of the kind of penitent young the father figure the kind god the merciful
the father and then you have the stone god imagery like paul that was already there
but now also a warrior god and then you have other images also female deities that are there
in terms of fertility but it's not mentioned as feminine but it's part of Yahweh's maker
so by the time you have the idea of god as the light or god as in flowing above the cherubim
or in heaven the very idea of a god as in heaven is immediately as its origins in astronomical
imagery and so this idea of god as a light that you can't look at um of a ruler of the skanis
with all these that you command the stars um this is solar imagery yes it's not um complete
identification it's more sophisticated but on the other hand without the solar imagery it's not there
so what we take for granted uh or we have in a christian context uh if you're a race christian
like me also have a lost faith but you you say god is light okay you don't think about it as a form
of primitive view um but the very fact that um uh is light it's it's it's you have to ask you have to
take nothing for granted so if it says um god is um light you have to ask but and it's easier when
you're out of the faith you can say okay but where is the obvious and greatest idea that the deity
which the word like Yahweh like also the word yo or elim also has certain roots related to power or
otherwise depending on my history so this idea of god is this heavenly god who is white um is
undeniably as its origins in solar imagery and right you look up at the sky you look up in the
side you the the greatest light there is and the best example is the sun itself so and this is
another reason why when it says like god is a consuming fire yes why would you you know what is
a consuming fire you know well that can be both solar and it can also be more geological i mean
people really um you can just look up in the internet from the storm over volcano you you'll see
what it actually looks like and they are there's not ever volcano that has been recently active
in the way the biblical texts locate Sinai but there's no doubt that the people were familiar
with some volcanic imagery and which later by the way became a view of how of a fire
we love it yeah yeah yeah and in god's punishment which would be that so yeah so so yes so what so
what you have is if you if you look at the the Israelites going through the desert now from a
pure and naturalistic or sacred view imagine yourself naive not naive because if naive is
historical and cultural relative but if you had to think you're in the desert and there's a
something that's a column of fire by night or pillar or smoke by day it is very clearly borrowed
from volcanic imagery that you would see as fire by night or day that does not mean that there was
an exodus we always more than the people walked and saw these things but the origin of this imagery
of smoke by day fire by night is a volcano it doesn't mean as in the oldest scholarship this
deity was just a personal fire volcano but like the sun gods in other religions that was one of
his manifestations and in the older tradition as a mountain deity definitely um so that's also why
people shouldn't come to close the mountain is rumbling there's this lightning and this is all
borrowed all these images are borrowed from or at least natural phenomena that was not understood
but it's not because it was not understood it was just when people describe the deities
they use these injuries not just metaphorical but but not just literal either there's always a
distinction between the deity and his appearance and anyways that's another thought yeah there's
so much there to dig into that you've brought up the the long story short i honestly want to
say this to our audience is as you can see there's no easy answer and for anybody anybody i want to
speak to them because this is something you just i take away from this whole lesson that you've
already taught us so far is anybody who acts like they know and they have the truth and they
understand what it says and like no just just know that that's not true um there is way more to this
than they know and when you get into this you'll begin to be more humbled by this entire discussion
and have respect for the research and and diving into this stuff but also you have something when
you listen to these academics you know you can walk away and go yeah they're trying to sell you
something and the real reality of the development is something i'm interested in i'm no longer
interested in the anachronistic philosophical understanding of god that we've made over time
that developed over a long time i want to know the reality of like how did these gods develop
and you know the famous quote god made us in his image um this is my opinion on everything i hear
you saying and everyone i do study we made the gods in our image but also in the image of the
natural world around us so it's not that it's completely made up people think oh god man just
made up these ideas no like their perception of the reality of the world they live in in the
natural world and the way things worked and operated played a big role as well as their own
experience their own morals their own ideas they projected because i suspect correct me if i'm wrong
if i'm thinking a certain way well god must be thinking a certain way and i must have got this
idea from god instead of the other way around yes um what happens is the same thing that happens
today in in many forms of apologetics on one end there's no historical consciousness so the popular
claim is that the reason you always describe what i did and describe it is because i presuppose from
the outset naturalistic assumptions i presuppose it's just a god like that other gods that the
ultimate is just the text not like other texts so on these naturalistic assumptions it looks like this
but it's because i am not saved or don't have this this is for a super naturalistic view right
but in reality um the thing is those people don't actually believe the bible if you can't just
believe the bible there's just one thing to believe about yaware and even nobody nobody in the bible
in the old testament studied the bible or thought um nobody in any given point of time
thought of yaware so that when people read today the word god or the lord and they bring all the
modern views of a perfect deity into it they have to remember that even where people say
yaware is like a king or like a master and people are servants or like a father even views
of what it meant to be a good king it was not democrat democracy it was not capitalist
there was no um the views of what even views of masculinity or malice what it meant to be a king
was different what it meant to be a father the role so the problem is there's no
historical consciousness so people will just repeat the translation of god or the father
and then people then bring all the contemporary associations of that into it and you can't really
blame them because they're not taught better right the problem is what gives the game away
is that like the apologists today they have even when they don't accept evolution or
cosmology as physicists in astrophysics they still have to borrow bits of it you see it in
people like William Lane Craig or others they they they still reason or like cosmological
arguments for the existence of god or seven they still say there's a universe with a cause but
this language universe and cause also have a history and the same with yaware's knowledge
in the old testament when yaware speaks of the natural world his knowledge is never better than
the people who constructed his character so he has the same wrong ideas about the world about
animals about so cosmology yes um and the problem is as with evolution there's always an error
theory or an explanation by the apologist why it seems so in the covenants tradition
yaware is simply accommodating himself to the people in the knowledge of the
so it is not really a fault or it's it's not a mistake when he refers to the earth as flat and
even then you have another different strain of apologists who say the bubble has all these
one scientific views and they reinterpret it just of this flat disk as a it's a it's not
a flat disk it's it's it's trying to describe yeah so when this this only arose with the rise of
modern science when religion had to defend it so so as soon as a new scientific theory comes up
they challenge a certain strain of religion because they have no historical scenes they are
gonna read into it what just like if for whatever reason aliens pretend pretend that aliens came
to earth they will automatically say see the watchers or see the Elohim the sons of god who
came down to marry daughters whatever you know yeah so the problem is because it's a philosophy
on the lies say fundamentalism because they have had that almost two millennia or longer
of being able to defend some of the views and against certain criticisms that were already
being of the early Roman philosophers and others and and because it's psychologically
cognitive dissonance or the experience of being refuted and nobody who takes the five
seriously it's just gonna say oh you're right I was wrong and so on because it's these they're so
connected with your entire world view and nobody wants to have a matrix experience that without
reality melts away so you people are gonna come up with these ad hoc hypotheses to explain why
it's still actually true otherwise they will modify the view of scripture but but then climb
it was always like that um and then places going through history but yes the best position I can
think of if I were and I'm gonna go on a a limb here the best position I can think of to try and
you know make a model for god that might work to me would be like open theism where god
learns and changes over time that's the only thing that to me if I were to force that idea
onto like I gotta keep this god well that could make sense of a lot of problems and god not knowing
god sorry god jealous what he's learning like we're learning that's okay but when you have
the later god that's a problem yes um it's very interesting what people are willing to give up
so in open theism and also in precious theism but then don't want to give up the goodness of god
so there's this good god who's not or doesn't have maximum greatness can't do everything
can't have all the power doesn't know everything in all the ways but but as with like the arguments
in philosophy of religion like the cosmological argument for god's existence even if the universe
had a cause it doesn't mean that causes god and definitely what god and so right and there could
be so many interpretations of cause and effect and even if you take that seriously so the same with
the world is actually makes people make sense of the events of their time and the concept of
their deity that is why in all this meant many images of Yahweh also as in responsible for evil
of course they interpret away these days because of Christianity and the good god but
as one um one scholar actually not biblical scholar I think he was a physicist also joked
that you can definitely keep god but there's no reason why there can't be a god it's just
not all powerful it is it's evil but not very efficient so um that is still
reconcilable with a lot of problems in the world and you wouldn't have all these discrepancies but um
of course they're not going to go for that because you have to understand everything is part of a web
if uh before one
as as critical scholars or even atheists we we we must also say that even if god as understood
doesn't exist what does exist is religion and what does exist are pernicious views that keep
sticking despite all the good science and all the good arguments so as scholars of religion
instead of just we can well be frustrated and but we must also try to distance ourselves
sometimes from it and say okay it's also a reality that people seem to keep on believing
things despite all else that these are the things that currently believe in so what kind of
interesting scientific explanation can we have for this doesn't have to be a attack of the person
or just say they're stupid or or this or they don't know better um besides evolutionary explanations
that it's adaptive if if certain views are certain psychological I mean there are stars
where things don't change too much for the organism um in the frame of reference um
reality shock is it's not good for everybody especially as you get older but also if you
look at religion over time and belief revision change in beliefs um even yagway and belief in
yagway doesn't just change there are always people who wanted to go on to older views and
some who are willing to go with new views so yes we can be frustrated at the across the
trees of religion at the stubbornness of people and they don't want to see it like this
but on the one hand there were times when we also couldn't and on the other hand
okay even if we move on let us just accept some people are never going to do it that
that's also the facts yeah yeah so yes you can one can try to be also missionary like in your
reverse uh convert deconvert people that is that that is there as it's used but
if you you can also be a scholar about it and say okay this is an interesting social phenomenon
god doesn't exist but the worship of gods and belief and these irrational thinking do and as
a since that as social effects god is a sociological or the concept the concept a certain
concept not many concepts of god is a certain sociological reality um that has effects in
society or the belief in it so i i went from very militant and i'm not saying this is better but
i guess to survive in or to cope with doing my job without being disgusted all the time i really
um had to and this is perfect cop out but i had to become more disinterested and move away from
the debating scene and the the angry artists that i was to to as as i would look at other
religions i'm not very much upset about other ancient gods um so for me that's like logical
transition happened where i just i tried to convince myself i'm very interested in all
these ancient gods and they become interesting and i can i can of course i i will also get worked up
if some uh if you have fundamentalist people in the in your face and um they they of course
understand that and that part of one doesn't go away because i mean there's so much everyone has
personal baggage but um i think in in some ways it helps one's scholarship if you can
if you can separate that sometimes when you study ancient journalism because otherwise one is also
more prone to want to to just accept certain views that the more the rocketry out there the better
and and initially then you believe whatever scholarship looks to really um take the old
belief apart so at least in that sense post scholarship it helps to become more disinterested
but i understand personally it's um when people come up with truth and certain views it can be
difficult to emotionally regulate this because we're still in our culture in transition we have
all these different yeah no i'm with you i think that uh that's been something i've been trying to
do over the last few years while i've been you know deconverting i guess you'd say um is to
find a way to appreciate uh the study and the religion and like the the the mainly the literature
i may not like uh certain things about these religions and the religion i specifically
came out of which was christianity there are certain forms and ideas that i just think aren't
very good but now that i'm looking at a kind of like a scientific approach where i want to look
at the text what is the origin where does this come from what is it really saying what was their
idea of the the world around them what was the real idea about how they understood god did god
have a physical body did god have sex did god have children you know what where did he where
was he at was there water above the heavens and did they think of a flat or earth all of these
things i like to do and yes in one respect they they completely cut up my current religious faith
that i came out of that evolved to try and combat science but i also know there's an like you could
take this approach like an anthropologist kind of like an anthropological approach an evolutionary
approach a psychological approach where there's emotion involved as well there's a lot of ways
to approach this but i also believe if you take like an evolutionary approach i think all of these
religions are byproducts of our survival mechanism and how we survive in the environments we live
in so yes you know while atheists love to bash christians and i get it or but bash whatever
religious view i understand why i did it and i sometimes still do it in little ways but i also
know that it's part of the process of us humans trying to learn the existential crisis of existence
why are we here why does the sun go up and then it comes down you know all of these questions we
want answers to and these are outdated um ideas that are trying to update but it seems that the
natural scientists have natural sciences have better conclusions first than the religious ones
that have all of these assumptions and they're trying to keep up with a different philosophy of
natural sciences so and i'm like what but anyway yeah no no you're absolutely right um i i do think
that in line with this conversation there are many um philosophers and scholars who have
just mentioned the fact that sometimes you don't need a proof as michael also said
that you don't need a proof that there is no god you just need to understand the history of idea
which is this unrefutation and then so the history of any dogma say for example the
divinity of christ or difference between the historical jesus and the jesus of later traditions
the difference between christian views of god now and earlier views um if you understand this
historically um then that is his own refutation you don't need a proof my thing you can't prove
and that's okay but like you said um the thing is if in a context of where one is a scholar of
religion and suppose as like you're a biologist you may be a vegetarian a biologist you may not
like that lines eat and eat um but you also there's a point where okay this is part of reality and if
you are a scientist then then that also requires an explanation of certain predator behavior and so
so um on the one end yes um uh there is no simple solution i i think nobody's the the liberally
hearted it also i i think sometimes we have this idea coming from a christian background
we want to converge people if they're just receptive we were just if they're just lesson
um uh if they just open themselves and so on the other way around we think the people just
listen to reason and i also thought so but years of debating and so it shows me it's a much more
complex thing and obviously yes one can get upset about certain forms of religious oppression and so
on but purely scientifically um and look not all evolutionary um byproducts are necessarily beneficial
beneficial for room but none are completely without beneficial i mean even visual thinking has
its upside so the problem is it's also not correlated to intelligence sometimes the smarter
person is the better they're able at coming up with all these extra arguments for why they're
still right after all so you can't say people not you but um it's very difficult psychologically
to explain the assistance of belief um because obviously it's it's it's not just about reason
when you when you start believing as a kid you didn't start because your the adults gave you
reasons and so when you believe and it's part of your life and it defines you it's it is it is really
connected to an identity that um to lose month five is it's literally to lose your worldview to
to lose your concept of self it's not and it that is um psychologically uh new waters for human
society where you in the past you grew up with the religion and you may have some changes but
we live in cultural changes where you you are exposed to aware of so many different cultures
different religions different denominations since protestantism came about and
it's it and i want to be a bad man but it's enough to make anybody crazy and i'm not saying people
believe uh the joker i'm not saying
yeah i i i really think it's
religious belief and persistence and conceptions of god and i'll i'll give you this brief example
i really don't think any of it is it it has its bad side and and then there are things
that scholars have discovered that are not so um easily dismissed as bad side if you think about
technology today where did humans first get the idea of that we can meet like we are now
across the distance sitting in a meeting um humans first imagine gods doing things traveling and
speed talking over distance communicating and appearing and disappearing these ideas i'm not
saying we needed all the religious oppression and social and certain views and wars and so
some of that theological ideas later became part of the history of ideas that get rise to
technology if if if we never imagined humanoid beings in the in the heavens or with certain powers
it's almost like it's not that ancient religions were science fiction as and that um
that the people had this idea that it will become technology but it's it's almost like humanity
by first imagining the gods doing things later eventually transcendent themselves to do those
things if you think about science nobody has a view of the world as a whole in the ancient world
nobody had this view of a cosmos as a whole this anybody came possible when you imagine the god
new skin of the cosmos and saw everything as a whole and as from a neutral point of view so that
this view is the view so in a way this the rising of scientific objectivity is not just coming from
the Greek philosophy and there's a history of neurotic Christian introspection where you are
not perfect you don't know anything you might be at fault so you're looking where might i be wrong
and this old tradition of Christian monks completely neurotic introverted as soon as
that became extroverted that you find in Charles Darwin where he was constantly making notes about
maybe he's wrong please send me your criticism help me with my theories a lot of the scientific
spirit as its origins in certain forms of religious asceticism a lot of the views of scientific
objectivity of and even some of the scientists will say i'm trying to see the world as a god we
see the mind of god like Isaac Newton thought thinking god thought doctrine it it's very
doubtful if people didn't imagine somebody looking at everything at once that one would have cosmology
developed as it did or that one would have understanding of nature as a whole you have to
remember people in ancient times had no idea that everything was glass connected and only when
they could imagine a god when humans tamed all the animals and a lot of the natural phenomena not
everything they could imagine themself looking at it so even today when science think of certain
things though history of life nobody's seeing this empirically nobody's seeing the universe
of the history of it but we first imagine this a god as maybe outside time or so and the same with
the future if you think all these debates and philosophy of religion like can can a all powerful
being of the stone can create a stone that he cannot live or can an omission or pre-ognition
deity know the future and and also be all powerful because if you know the future you can't change it
so he's not all powerful or can an omission deity have free will because if he knows everything
he's going to do for all time he can't do anything else so he doesn't have free will
or can an omnipresent deity be anywhere but everywhere and all therefore also how is that
mean with everything and all these things and I can tell you this the more technology develops
some of these things come back they come back and they become real problems if you had to add
everybody at one point in the far future technology was so advanced that everybody could have their
own mental universe through over and you have over your power and you have to make certain
decisions about your simulated universe or your game whatever or it becomes such that humanity can
manipulate time in space and do things that only the gods or the all powerful gods could do
then all these metaphysical riddles that currently is completely like it has no use
might just come and return and so it's not like the old theology means old form as a use
but theology is constantly returning and the gods are constantly returning not just as
mobile characters or whatever but as as soon as science fiction arises you'll see how much is
borrowed from other math because we have now the language to talk so that even the debates
philosophically general fundamentalists and they're now worried about whether and all good god
can can also be there's a world full of evil the problem evil and this is not absolutely
relevant in the questions of certain forms of politics we and certain forms of future imagined
realities where you you you have a governing other place and can you can you have evil without
we won't of course it's kind of couched in christian and prognostic terms depending on the religion
or in our thoughts but i i don't think it's not that it's because of these religious superstitions
that the science fiction and the technology eventually comes to pass it's in spite of it
but it's still part of this conceptual history without which even things like human rights
of course there was no such thing of course there was slaves of course it was horrible the
way people were treated and women and so on and children even and others peoples but unless you
have this image of a god under whom all people are equal who made everybody there was no image of
other peoples as your equals i'm not saying that there was no oppression in christianity but
on that form of ethical and even science fiction as i've discussed
it might have its use from that but maybe not now
so here's why scholars of religion already show how despite all the nonsense and and the
horrors and the wars and whatever else the superstitions was then religion
the rise of critical thinking in the west besides things like the roman law court
or the greek philosophers there were things even in the so-called dark ages which is a
pejorative term of in certain forms of christianity that you would think as an atheist this is
absolutely the worst and somehow that became part of developing critical thinking in the west
where part of the scientific spirit is this epistemological humility that either marry
everything i could be wrong so i have to keep on investigating check myself and this constant self
doubt this that would not be possible without the other neurotic introspection of christians
who believe things that we don't believe in so it's all part of the story
you know so i'm not justifying anything i'm not saying i'm saying the bigger picture shows you that
it's not this all that or this in human history of ideas even the worst religious
conceptions or the one with the worst permittical effects somehow a residual element of that
gets taken up into a collective psyche or whatever you want to call it or a theory and it has unexpected
results um we're all inside of a big science project and we're all trying to figure it out
here's my last question as i let you go i want to do this again by the way um suppose someone
really wants to know the truth they want to get to the bottom of this and so they have
option between two fields that they want to approach to get at the answer and i'm giving you
this question because i engaged recently with a conversation i don't do debates personally
i like to have conversations i think debates are like tribalism want like like perfect tribalism
you have a football team i have a football team well who are you rooting for i root for the
buffaloes oh i root for the um miami dolphins okay oh when they go in and they go to have their
match one team wins the other team loses you're still a fan of your team and they're still a
fan of their team and it's just that's it i don't debates are like ancient tribes fighting to me
and so i'm more interested in learning from my the person who's different and hoping that they'll
learn from me and i recently had a conversation with a Calvinist i used to be one uh i don't
know if you know what a Calvinist is okay so he wanted to mention Jordan Peterson and then get
into philosophy and he went all into this philosophy philosophy philosophy i'm not a big philosophy
guy i don't know a lot about philosophy i know enough to keep track but i'm not like a uh look i
start with philosophy and then i work that word for me i started i start with like historical
methodology i want to get into the text i want to know its origins what it meant in its original
context and approach things on the ground because i noticed philosophy can be word salad a lot of
times people could say anything and it could sound good and i can listen to one philosopher
who's a theist and it could sound true and it can make sense and then i listen to Graham oppie for
example uh and he's a atheistic philosopher in austria and he and boom atheism makes sense and
it's like they both make sense if you listen to one guy he knows how to bend words and it sounds
good and then it bends another word and for me i thought maybe i'd get your opinion do you think
if someone really wants to get to the bottom of understanding the truth about the bible the
truth about yaway the truth about l the truth of this religion that they shouldn't start with
philosophy but they should get into the text and get into its origins and look at the historical
cultural um you know zeitgeist in which this literature is written and what were the ideas
going instead of starting with philosophy which already carries all that baggage and would you
agree with me on this i i would um if if one is looking for truth um i'd say what you mean by
think think of it as what um physicists or scientists would say they would say our current
knowledge um uh the as best we can or mainstream scholarship this is we are these current theories
these are the dated we no longer question this or talk about this most so by definition the
scientific a scientific spirit doesn't work with truth in all the sense this this quest for
absolute truth i is part of religious heritage as a scientific ideal is great but the best scientists
will say um we we know what is not the case they said good reasons for what we no longer think like
that but we also know that the language in which we talk about these things are historical and
cultural context the paradigms and science the all these things have an influence but to the best
of our knowledge such and so and so so i would say that when you get to something like biblical
scholarship it's it's not an exact science it's not so like for example in source criticism the
documentary hypothesis in mainstream scholarship does you work on it especially in the european
context then it worked with the jdp theory and if you look at the history of theory but what you
can't do is you you can't like the mistake uh many conservative scholars make is or
fundamentalism by definition they can't be philosophers because there are some things
you can't they can't question and since philosophy is the ability to at least question everything
at least as an experiment and they can't seriously question with the current system by
definition they can't do philosophy in that in that mode so that's why you find all fundamentalist
philosophy and religion is actually apologetics it's not philosophy and philosophy doesn't give
you answers it helps you to understand why certain things become a question why certain things
become problems and different ways of seeing this problem and we need that we need this ambiguity
and multiplicity of views because people get stuck in one view and then even science can get stuck so
i would say yes um if you if you're looking for deep truth about the our way in our audience of
your way and all these things and these things and the meaning you'll find that the forefront of
research is a running debate but don't think like a carbonist you think aha look the scientific
scholarship gives us now answers number one you can't we can't level both the faith on
definitive answers it leads to nihilism or meaninglessness so it's just that shows you it's
it's not functional for our species and also given that that scientists have met everything's open
and there's nothing to add on to and we were raised with the idea that you have to stick the
beliefs and something brought on in the western culture like that and it's existentially puts
them off immediately so the mistake they make is you know in a possible world imagine certain
theories in astronomy um are shown to be problematic or certain views and biology
certain things to open what's wrong take this imaginary world where everything about evolution
is wrong and everything about current astronomy is safe wrong the mistake they make is that they
because they're only work negative they can't do science so fundamentalist biblical
scholarships mistake is that they never come up with research they only come up with new
defenses for things for what they are gonna believe in so they think if they can disprove
in their mind evolution or certain cosmological views or at least make them if they can disprove
it their view wins by default that's the mistake they make
even if you disprove evolution or disprove cosmology and then cosmology
that is not a proof for a certain fundamentalist view of the bible of the history of life of the
cosmos so you don't prove yourself right by proving somebody else wrong the second one is that
um as was shown in the bites about religious language you if you ask them what would count
as a proof against your belief that would be very fine at all the space for any conditions
that you actually count so all this the biking is a force there's nothing that's going to convince
them they really might not mind you are the one right um and so what happens now in philosophy
of religion is some of them say okay we can't prove you wrong and you can't prove us wrong
our our task is to prove that at least we are not irrational people like i've been planting
our and others they just want to show that they are at least not irrational they can't prove themselves
but it's still rational and then they have always are looking so long story short for your um if you're
looking for the truth don't think of scholarship as the truth think of the best given everything we
have learned given everything we have discovered um and that people who were very religious and
fundamentalists they also discovered and that's how some of these ideas began um
you can as as in natural science you you can find the current state of scholarship
the best we are able to come up with and um then you can now yes some things might change
but it's still the best of where we are at um this is very difficult so it's not the truth but
because if it was the truth and you have all these truth if scholarship now is the truth
it um it means that um it's at an end and it doesn't mean we go on because we need
truth so we can go on it just means as in all sciences everything must be left open for constant
new understanding because it's always something more to know there's always things we can't know
there's gaps and so the problem is on the one hand that conservatives and the conservative mentality
think well if you admit that you could be wrong or that the theory might change why should i take
you seriously now and that's also the arguments the environment but what i don't get is because
i have no historical consciousness in one year it was like this all the time we always make things up
as we want the one do the best we can that's why you know but that's why your work like what you're
describing about Yahweh what you've been describing about the god of the bible what you've been
describing while they're saying that this is what i want to point out to them is that your god your
concepts of this god that you believe in is evolving this same way there is no absolute this is the
way this god is at one point your god did not exist outside of space and time at one point
he was not omniscient omni benevolent omni this and and so like getting them to see it in their own
court you know their own uh their own you know world then they they should humble themselves
right to try at least to make them humble i don't want people to say i don't want there to be a god
and i don't believe in there i don't believe there's something i can't believe there's anything i'm
no i tell people all the time spinoza you know you can you can think of concepts of something
of a deity but it's like fundamentalist um who are knocking on your door who are pushing it and
are making political changes in the world and things like that these are backwards ideas often
some of these things are bad you know so yeah yeah you're right about that i think there is a room
for debate um it's not for everybody but people like me and you wouldn't be out if people were
not debating because we we sort of learned because we followed some debates and that changed our mind
so there is hope that people's minds can change um it doesn't mean we have a much to offer them
necessarily because from there we what we offer is a lot of omega fair because there's no certain
there's no so so you're the reason people don't go for these views is on the one hand they already
have centuries of explanations why people think like us are wrong and what's wrong with us and all
these uh whether we are possessed or we don't have that spirit we're not really safe or we
we are we are fallen for the naturalistic assumptions of science or we go out to the long
disappear positions or we have been led by liberal theology or we just start out segment
all these they all these error theories so they're already going to have all these ways that it will
never work if you ask them just um accept this fact because besides having no historical consciousness
that the things have a history because dogma is eternal and they also um already have an
explanation of why we think like we this way historical way and but what you can do is there's
a books two books by james bore fundamentalism and uh from a few decades ago and escaping from
fundamentalism or beyond fundamentalism and these books actually helped me to understand
that the fundamentalist not uh to understand not what is the truth but why what's that what i'm
what i'm doing with the bible and then i'm not so biblical as i think so and the other thing is
you have to understand subconsciously people are not listening to reasons because they've been so
scared about what it means to be an atheist and that literally as philosophers like Nietzsche have
shown because all god is all the value and this world is nothing if in very subconscious
um calculations that they're not even aware of all they can think about if there is no god
then life is meaningless because literally since all value is in god and this world is not worth
much they got away and in that the natural world is not for them very interesting place it's not
it's not life is not exciting um but they believe they fall into immorality and relativism and
nihilism or it's a psychological existential threat and as it was to me i mean that that
deconversion of me some people say that it was liberating for them to be free of the fetus for
me it was absolute for about a decade i mean oh wow so i think suicide initially it was
unreal i mean i i i initially i didn't want to it was a very reluctant deconversion it took a long
time and i pretty much made sure about everything about it and read up everything i can to make sure
that i'm on my for a mistake it would be too big if i was using it so um so there are so much things
in place that it's very complex what helps a person move on and think historically but wow
yeah there's there's a lot of good scholarship and some views are better than others but because
everything is so specialized it's difficult to follow the leading scholars and the technical
stuff and like most people can't think they're experts on cosmology but they don't know
math and physics and so but they've always arguments against so that's a problem and because
their own authority is in religion seem to know so much more and they're from the faith they're
going to listen to them and it's the singular thing that guides this is authority all the way
you have authority like in the military there's certain things you just have question and there's
a hierarchy and the same in religion yeah there's a baking order and even in your mind so to to move
through that to lose all faith in authority in a certain line i don't know it's different for
everybody but i've when i found out it's just it's simple reasons simple explanations saying this is
not how it is it usually doesn't work there's something behind that that they have to get
a psychological emotion there's a lot more to the whole thing and they can even learn all
liberal theology that i won't be converted yeah exactly there's something else that and it's not
that i must now open themselves it's those books of james bar and please for me it worked i discovered
it didn't work for everybody else it didn't even i didn't buy all the liberal theology on and so on
but there were some things that was the core of fundamentalism that you are biblical and he brings
in this historical view to show you that you are not as biblical as you think and there's no such
things to be in but because since the biblical things are diverse but he also anticipates all
your fundamentalist reasons of what you're going to say and because you have all your so and then
philosophy of religion which is also a group if you if you learn all the arguments what let
least learn that you're proofs for our existence or your religious experience is not so such a
reality that you thought it was so i think there's a lot of i don't know i can't speak on behalf
anybody else who say the bithy is good or bad or basically good or bad yeah again it's too complex
but that is my curse as a scholar it's everything is complex and i've never pledged in complexity but
you know it's yeah well dr yako getik is this correct is it getik thank you so much this has
been a blast i really want to do this again and get deep diving into some of your books and have
another interview with you so as we're exiting here i want everybody to make sure you go check
out my patreon help support us here at myth vision go to amazon the link is down in the description
he's got three books what is a god of course the new one here is a i really look forward to diving
deep into each individual book and maybe do an episode specifically on that book in the future
also he has an academia page he's written a lot on academia so you can go there and read and read
and read and read and read and read and read lots and lots of reading and then also he has
the website so he break dot dot org um this is where obviously i was able to pull off you know
his specialty what he does and so i really appreciate you joining me on myth vision
let's do this again thanks so much derrick just a small remark on those books that more
research book for scholars they're not popular um so there's a lot of technical stuff and the two
last ones um have a lot of typos that are discovered um so that's a bit of a shame for me but um
they are more research works they're not um i don't know if the if somebody with no background
will find them very interesting um but i can definitely recommend related literature that
were written for public not pretty supposing a lot of background of course people are welcome to
read them but um to be honest um as interesting as the title sounds that was the marketing division
deciding against what i wanted the title to be because it will catch your eyes and searches and
so on but it's a bit technical and it's written for other researchers so but thank you so much i
also enjoyed and i appreciate this opportunity because i need to research and don't get a lot of
time actually interacting with the public and we have time i appreciate these little occasions
we i'm giving opportunity and thank you so much for your esteem and the invite and i wish you well
thank you this has been a blast i hope you've learned something let us know down in the description
or down in the comment section what your thoughts are of this episode and ya way you know volcano god
deity king the name all the stuff the linguistic terminus ad quim terminus ad quo where do you
think this stuff goes and uh i thought this was very academic please never forget we are myth vision
ladies and gentlemen join myth visions patreon not only to support us but there are 72 videos that
i did with dr denis r mcdonald and richard carrier all on the patreon early access you guys can ask
personal questions when i go to interview these scholars and you're helping myth vision grow
