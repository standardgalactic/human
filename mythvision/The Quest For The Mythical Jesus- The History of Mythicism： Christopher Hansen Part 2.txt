We are MythVision. Welcome back to MythVision podcast. Your host Derek Lambert. We're going
to be talking about the history of Methodism. We've already had part one with Christopher
Hansen and you've done a fantastic job describing a lot of the history that took place with Methodism.
It sounds like it was like a predominant or even a majority position for skeptics at least
during certain times in our history and of course I love what you do and the reason why is it shows
that with new information we should always consider it and move forward in our inner
knowledge and I am not a mythicist. I say that up front. I am agnostic on the Jesus question,
seeing very good reason why there may have been and seeing good reason why a lot of its myth
and how to know is very confusing depending on the methodology you use and all sorts of stuff
so it's an interesting question I like to journey into. Our first part we were way back in black and
white TV days before that okay before TV existed. We're getting into the 20th century here and
you've done a little bit of that last time so can you recap what we've discussed and what we may be
talking about today? Christopher Hansen by the way if you don't mind mentioning your book
that's coming and a little bit about you for our audience. Yep so hi everybody for those that don't
know I am Chris Hansen. I am an activist and I'm also primarily primarily in my scholarly stuff
working on the history of Methodism and also trying to create a more conducive platform for
having actual debate on whether or not Jesus existed. My book has been recently accepted,
it's been accepted at Whitman Stock. It's going to be entitled The Quest of the Mythical Jesus
and so basically it will hopefully be out in the next year or a year and a half so
the Quest of the Mythical Jesus. I'm calling back to to Albert Schweitzer he had the Quest of
the Historical Jesus mine is the Quest of the Mythical Jesus. I know you did this on purpose
I mean you knew you were going to catch some crap from people. You're making kind of a pun there
for anybody who doesn't understand like you're saying we got to look for the Mythical Jesus
technically because you're suggesting there's a historical Jesus made. Yeah well it's a it's a
specifically a pun on the work of Albert Schweitzer. Albert Schweitzer wrote what is one of the most
quintessential tomes of historical Jesus scholarship back in the early 1900s and I think we talked about
it briefly because he was actually part of the Mythesis debate as well but he wrote The Quest
of the Historical Jesus and it was an absolutely seminal work and it is still at least called back
to by academics today like his central thesis of an apocalyptic Jesus is still held by academics
like Bart Ehrman. So I decided because his work was very focused on going through different
presentations of Jesus in historical literature since I'm doing a similar thing I'm going to
pun off of this title so we are now we are now entertaining the Quest of the Mythical Jesus
and so I think last time we did talk about I think mythicism in the Soviet Union right
and we talked about the Arthur Dress controversy and so we're starting to move into modern times
then so just as a brief recap at the dawn of the of the 20th century in Germany specifically
there started a the probably the largest debate on whether Jesus existed or not in history. It was
primarily sparked by Albert Kaltow who was a pastor actually in Germany. He was at St.
Miranda. I can't remember this exact place. Anyways he joined the German Monast League
and the German Monast League facilitated a lot of this and then Arthur Dress wrote De
Christus Mitha in 1909. It was it is probably to this day the best-selling mythesis book ever written.
It was something that influenced basically the entire world of mythicism.
It was translated into at this point at this point it's been probably translated into more
than a dozen languages. It had it was in that day it was translated into Japanese, Russian,
French, English, Spanish, and more. It influenced debates that happened in India.
It had it influenced Kotoko Shitsui in Japan. It also is then what sparked the acceptance of
mythicism in the Soviet Union. Vladimir Lenin in his article on the significance of
militant materialism argued that basically if we were going to take out religion we should
ally ourselves with people like Arthur Dress who are so instrumental in destroying the Christian
faith that way. During this time it's also worth noting that most proponents of mythicism particularly
in Germany and Russia usually were anti-religious in some way or at least anti-Christian. Arthur
Dress thought that Christianity for example was like an impedance on science and on culture
and so he wanted to create a new religion. He had an idealistic monism. He basically created
a new religion to replace Christianity. Vladimir Lenin saw Dress's religion as ridiculous and said
that that need to be wiped out too. Just wipe out all religion but we'll use Arthur Dress's work
to take out Christianity while we're at it. That's basically how it became the majority
position in the USSR which was staunchly anti-religious and especially anti-Christian
with the vast majority of its members, the leading mythicists in academia in the Soviet
usually being a part of the godless militant league. There was an atheist museum that
Joseph Krivlev was part of, Sergei Kovalev was head of atheist movements and stuff like that.
Most of these historians of the Bible were usually also associated with ardent anti-religious
activism in some way. Towards the 1950s then the Khrushchev Thaw happens. That was basically
a policy that was starting to open things up a little bit and then Archibald Robertson's book
The Origin of Christianity was translated into Russian and that basically started a complete
downward trend for mythicism because Archibald Robertson's book was a Marxist analysis of
early Christianity from the perspective that Jesus existed and so it demonstrated that
Marxist academics did not actually have to require Jesus not exist and it sparked a massive debate
and in a Russian journal in the 1960s there was hosted a specialized issue of it all on whether
or not Jesus existed and basically coming out of the 1960s almost every single Marxist academic
in including all the Bible well most of all the Bible academics in the Soviet Union came
to the conclusion either that Jesus existed or that the issue wasn't important and so they didn't
even bother talking about it anymore and by the 1980s Joseph Krivlev was basically the last
mythicist in Russian academia and then by the 90s he died the year that the Soviet Union
collapsed if I remember correctly and with that basically all mythicists in academia were gone
in Russian academia to my knowledge is now all historicists. Now what we didn't get into last
time was then a parallel development actually in China so in this is where we go and this is
where we're going to step into more of the modern time frame so right now we're now pushing into
the 1970s so I'm going to focus on China first but we have to remember when I go back parallel to
what's going on in China there are other developments specifically in England
that are really important and also in Germany so in China after the Communist Party won out
basically after World War II and Mao Zedong took over religious studies in particular became
extremely censored in China and one thing that became basically a mainstay was the
promotion of the idea that Jesus did not exist. This was actually influenced a lot by the work of
Kotoku Shutsui out of Japan for those that are unaware Kotoku Shutsui was an anarchist
in Japan he was trying to basically fight against the imperial regime against the emperor and
everything and he wrote a book called on the obliteration of Christ which was published after
his death in 1911. He died because he was falsely implicated in a plot to assassinate the emperor
and then executed for it and then the book came out after that almost all of Kotoku's work was
actually considered was actually censored but this one actually somehow got through the censors
even though basically the reason he argued against Jesus' existence was he used it also as a metaphor
to argue that basically it was very anti-emperor so it's really odd that that managed to actually
make it through the censorship but it did and then from that time there were a number of
of Chinese academics also that were visiting in Japan and a few of them one of them we don't know
for certain because the first translation of his work into Chinese is anonymous uh it's
signed under a pseudonym so basically what ends up happening is that it's brought into Japan in the
1920s and translated into Mandarin and then simultaneously Jujutsu uses it to basically
argue that Jesus was a liar and deceived everyone. This further developed by so basically from about
1945 to 1948 onward it was the mainstay in Chinese academia to teach people that Jesus did not exist
and that was basically the end of it and there wasn't really any debate on it. Archibald Robertson's
work was translated into Mandarin shortly after it was published in the 1950s but it
actually didn't make much of any impact there in fact according to Wang Xiaoqiao in this book
the Chinese face of Jesus Christ volume 3b the and also I apologize to all people because I've
tried to learn the pronunciations but I don't worry we're not going to crucify you I promise yeah
but anyways um he are he basically notes that he couldn't find a single rebuttal to Robertson's
work in Chinese academics at all it just made like almost no impact surprisingly so the exact
opposite of what happened in the USSR but what actually ended up happening is so in the late
1970s what happened was called the open door policy and this policy opened up it first started
opening up things like trade and economics and then also started opening up academics a little bit
more and so within a few years there was a journal that was started on the hit uh in academia that
was approved for the studying the history of Christianity for study of religion and a bunch
of other stuff um and so this began actually a whole series of debates that really start in the
late 70s and early 80s so in 1981 Hu Yutong publishes a paper on the arguing that Jesus existed
and he argues it primarily based on the idea that it just seemed absurd that the gospels the
epistles and then also some extra biblical sources all seemed to have this idea that there was a
person Jesus and that somehow was just all made up um but then two years later Yin Changyu
published another article in the same journal entitled Jesus a Legendary and Unhistorical
Figure and he basically argued on the premise of silence that Jesus never existed so he argued
that Josephus never wrote about Jesus and that was an interpolation oddly enough it's not he didn't
do it actually based on the language Josephus used but on the fact that he noticed that Josephus
considered Vespasian via Messiah and so he's like why would he can sit why would he write
that about Jesus being in Messiah when he thought that Vespasian was so he didn't he never wrote that
so it was actually for me that's a really intriguing argument um but uh then he and but then he also
argues that we can't date the gospel so they can't be used as any solid evidence and so our
basically argues that because we have no sources that can adequately attest to Jesus that he didn't
exist um what ended up uh shifting actually it is towards the end of the 80s and then into the 90s
actually what was a very particularly influential work again again according to
Zhao Chao is actually the work of John Dominic Crossen. John Dominic Crossen published a book
Jesus a Revolutionary Biography in the early 90s and it was translated into Mandarin and it had a
huge impact primarily from the because it was not clearly apologetical so it was not like
clearly with a christian bias to it and was also taken from a sociological standpoint
and so um Chinese academics really took to that work and then another um Chinese academic
who was very influential was Tang Yi um and he published a book on the history of Christianity
and also argued that Jesus existed in it so by the 1990s Chinese academics also
started dropping mythicism and today I can't find anything past the 2000s that really attests
to Chinese academics using it any longer this brings up a great question I think uh that's
necessary I love when you are telling us the history and what I really loved about last
episode including what you're already doing so far is as you're telling us like scholarship in
these particular places in the world how they change from mythicist to historicist or historicist
to mythicist you kind of give a little bit of the details as to like what their argument was and
you're not even coming through bias that's one thing I really appreciate in this what you're
doing right now even though you have a position and in fact you would openly say I'm biased you're
saying this is what they said and I love that about you and what you're doing here you're teaching
something amazing my question would be this we started finding some stuff and I know this is
kind of pausing the timeline on pushing into contemporary because we're going to get there
but with the discovery of the Nagamati texts discovery the Dead Sea Scrolls like further
research into knowing some of the stuff that was going on in the first century bc ad or bce
and then common era ce and onward we found out more than what we knew in the 1800s let's just put
it that way is there any arguments that the scholars are using at this point to say hey
okay this helps the weight of an apocalyptic teacher why would they have been in full fiction
when we have evidence of guys like it kind of like we can go to the book of acts and we could say
look he looks like the adus the egyptian like it's another movement like that but it survives the war
so we keep it around and those are good arguments by the way which I find compelling and this is why
I cannot say I'm staunch mythicist no I'm not I'm I'm agnostic because I don't have all the
information and I'm not as well read and eventually I plan to take a position if the evidence leads
me there and I can entertain historical Jesus all day long I just did a Dave Allen video
loved his theory his idea was there a negative testimony in flavinium like was there something
there that wasn't in positive light of a character that might have been Jesus I don't know it's
interesting so I just say that to say was there anything before we move on was there like
archaeological evidence was there more evidence we didn't have that really mythicism couldn't
survive in an academic world the way it did in the 1800s for so to speak because there was more
weight brought to the table in a different respect that made them think hey there was a guy and there's
more likely there was a guy than there wasn't and here's why yeah so I um in chinese academics I
can't see that was a huge factor in it as much um it was it was the case with a lot of chinese
academics actually a lot of them did not speak a lot of the languages of of the ancient christians
that much so they aren't always working from a lot of primary primary sources directly a lot of
times they're working either from translated sources or translations of translations and stuff like that
um uh but this that has been definitely changing uh quite a lot uh recently um but it was definitely
the case in russian academics especially it was actually the dead sea scrolls in particular
that changed a lot of understanding about about early christianity um the dead sea scrolls uh
were very quickly uh grabbed on by soviet academics before that when discussing christianity
basically everything that they wanted to know about christianity was basically to be found in
this book by abram revanovich um it is uh um basically uh it is the sources of early christian
history and it was primarily all greco- roman sources um and then also the new new testament
sources and stuff like that they didn't have a whole lot outside of that yet um the when the dead
sea scrolls began being published in russia um it became extra a huge thing um and then also what
what it it really influenced the way that they characterized early christianity and thought
about how early christianity developed because it made it seem more plausible that a person could
have started it in this way because they had now a whole lot more background information
another thing that really changed their positions and actually in the second edition of this book
which is what i have um uh the they ended up um when more data was published specifically on the
testimonium um flavianum a lot of them changed their positions as well um so uh for those unaware
in the 1970s um shalom opines published a small book um on the syriac fragments uh and arabic
he had found of the testimonium in other uh writers works like agapius um and so in that those works
basically was presented a testimonium that didn't have all of the clear interpolations that we do
in the greek in the textus receptus um and so that was latched on by russian academics as well
really hard and um the historicists were like see y'all were just wrong the partial the partial
authenticity thing was right um and so um for example um there's a passage on it in an appendix
here by erinus fenstkoi um uh and then that was only that's only been further um aided by the
discovery of some uh different latin recensions of the uh testimonium which don't have the really
forceful language either for example in one of the uh one of the recensions by rufinus i think
is a reading that is he was believed to be the christ instead of he was the christ um
so there is there's a lot more that's been discovered out there in russian academics
latched onto that and so that really also helped influence their position i was going to ask you
about that specifically um he was believed to be like so the consensus i need to ask because i'm not
brought up on the consensus um some of the mythicist friends of mine that are that are scholars in
this field will say look uh it's hard to make good evidence out of bad evidence right so it's almost
like um you remember the oj semson case when the guy fbi agent had the blood come on they had his
they had dna they had evidence to to prove he was guilty yet they had to throw it out because
the guy didn't go through the proper procedures when he was actually taking this evidence uh
against oj semson well they're kind of making that argument like well this is bad evidence so how
can you make good evidence but when you take a magnifying glass to this thing is it your opinion
and the consensus opinion that listen there's probably something that was here this isn't
an ex nihilo interpolation i don't want to get caught up on this because i know you're trying
to get into the history yeah i think this plays a part to some degree if they're talking about a
guy i mean we the argument is used by christians they have a hard time arguing with mythicists
because well you know look at what it says it's obvious jocephus didn't really think that and
there's evidence maybe that it comes from a luke n type gospel maybe you see this did interpolate this
but what are your thoughts like quickly if you don't mind so uh yeah my position i i'm going
to actually be real my position is that i think it's interpolated entirely okay i think and i
think that the james brother of jesus passage is probably as well i'm perfectly willing to change
my mind on it um uh but right now i think that they're interpolated but if i was to actually
pause it that they were uh that there was like a core to them in some way i actually don't still
don't consider them good evidence either i actually agree with mythicists on this and the reason i do
is because let's uh let's just say that it that it was authentic in some way we have no idea what
it said all the reconstructions are hypothetical and so my problem is that i don't think you can
actually gain solid evidence from a hypothetical source this is my one of my major christisms
abart airman's book so he appeals to um sources like q and m and l but we don't actually have any q
m or l these are reconstructions and they're hypothetical and so i don't think you can base
um and i don't think you can base evidence of the historical jesus on a hypothetical reconstruction
even if it seems like a solid reconstruction i don't think you can because i don't think you can
epistemologically get there and there's um one more problem that's actually even worse than in the
case of q when we look at the testimonium um and i'll be done after this but basically when we look
at the testimonium and it the fact that it's hypothetical we also then have no idea where
the information came from and so it could be that he got this information from christians
could be that he had another source and got it from like a jewish source on uh on jesus but we
have no idea where it came from and so we're basically left in this state of even if it did
exist it's a hypothetical reconstruction so we can't really argue that we know anything about
jesus from it and even if we had a solid reconstruction of it that we could all agree on
we still don't know where it came from where that information stemmed from
well thank you thank you for taking the time to yeah no i it's interesting because uh i think
you know i'm learning and i think that's an interesting topic to look into but anyway i stopped
you i'm gonna go back to full screen view and it's back on you brother just take us off but
i figured the dead sea scrolls played a part and that's why i asked and i'm sure there's more to it
when they analyze the linguistics they start considering things they probably said you know
what okay uh i think it's this fits more of a historicist position in their view and i'd like
to get of course into contemporary times and and stuff like that as we go too so okay so like you
know well uh i'm gonna step back just a little bit we're going to go back into the 1960s again now
so in the 1960s we do have some more mythicist work coming up uh in new zealand there's a um
there's a writer named patrick cambell who wrote a pamphlet uh called um the mythical jesus or
something like that uh in new zealand um he was um i can't find much information on him but i know
that the work went through a number of editions um the latest one i found i think was a third
edition of the work in the late 1960s um so we know that was present there we know it was present
in australia there are works that were being printed like small pamphlets and stuff in the
united states by secularist presses trying to push out uh mythicism but it basically had no
academic acceptance but academics were actually still responding to it um there it wasn't that
they were like completely ignored um by far they were not like handled with with much care but
like you could still find like short chapters on them and stuff like that um coming into the 1970s
though this starts to really change big time um so night the early 1970s we have three authors
two in england and one in germany all publishing simultaneously uh for the most part on whether
or not jesus existed and these are john m allegro the um ga wells and uh uh rudolf augstein uh in
germany so uh i'll start with uh uh john allegro allegro was actually one of the most famous dead
sea scroll scholars um ever uh you can find pictures of him smoking over the scrolls
they will make you cringe trust me those early scholars will make you cringe in those photos
they're sitting there cigarette smoke over these 2000 year old artifacts and you're just like
wow it was a different time but uh uh but allegro basically uh he'd been coming off of a
couple controversies so he had come off like the copper scroll controversy and i won't get into that
but there's a uh you can you can read about it elsewhere um and he was criticized quite frequently
for not citing everything properly and making it hard to find stuff in his published work um
but then uh in the 1970s based he got really into um sumeriology and then also then uh the
dead sea scrolls and he got a lot of got into this realm of conjectural linguistics um basically he
came to the conclusion um that jesus did not exist but that he was a mushroom hallucination
by a cult of clandestine worshipers who would ingest hallucinogenics
and then have these hallucinogen visions of jesus um it was not based on much of solid evidence
a lot of it was based off of these really conjectural readings of things uh in the dead
sea scrolls and the new testament based on these speculative and often just made up
etymologies and readings from Sumerian um for example using Sumerian to get the idea that
Jesus's name means semen that saves yes um what that's crazy yeah okay yeah and look i just want
to say for anybody watching like i'm not against the idea that there are potential locations of
the early church that might have uh possibly potentially ingested things that might have made
them see things like a shamanistic sense i don't know this but uh you know i'm not closed off to
that but to say that that means jesus himself was that experience that that uh that i think that's
way overstepping the boundaries of possibly spiked wine within a ritualistic ceremony
or something like that's different than in my opinion than saying jesus himself was the ritual
you see what i'm saying like yeah yeah and so um as one can imagine Allegro's work was not taken
fondly um it it that's an understatement to say the least uh there was mass protests from academics
so and Allegro had anticipated this so Allegro was occasionally brought up as a case of an
of um mythicist who was forced out of academia uh and was and was like fired from his position
this is not true uh he was not fired uh he actually left his academic position before the
publication of the book um but basically um he was kind of forced out in the way that basically
this was the last straw he'd already had a history with controversial ideas that were not being
accepted at all and this was kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back finally they're
like okay why are we still listening to him um the there were a mass ton of reviews published
of his work all of them scathing by academics i only think i found one that was even remotely
positive um in the entire english-speaking world um it was just lambasted um it was bad enough
that there was a letter signed by several academics in a newspaper in england including
by his dissertation advisor basically condemning the work um and it got to the point that the
publisher actually apologized for publishing it um easily one of the biggest controversies
in recent history on whether Jesus existed um but despite this he did get picked up by
secularist movements and we'll get to that because in the 1980s there was a there was a bit of a
fiasco because of it actually again but in the atheist community um so but then
contemporaneously at the same time there was an academic who uh who was not actually a vital scholar
but he was at but he was more or less at least taken seriously um and this was g.a wells uh g.a
wells uh was a he recently passed away rest in peace uh but he was an academic of german
and german intellectual history and language uh in england um he did not have a specialization in
the bible but he made sure to do his research and read the literature and to make sure he knew
what he was talking about um so he was not by any means uh a poor academic on the matter i
consider him actually one of the best mythicists to have ever written um personally um and i have
most of his works as well um he his first book uh was published in the early 70s um and at the
time he was still arguing that in favor of there being like dying and rising god parallels and
stuff to jesus um g.a wells is very notable for being probably the most consistently evolving
mythicist in written with his written publications uh he changed his views according to criticism
he just admitted he was wrong and he just kept evolving um and so uh it actually came to the
point that in the 1980s he actually scorned other mythicists for still doing the pagan parallel
stuff uh he he was like no this is this is wrong um you can actually read this uh so he did a
brief little debate in a volume edited by our Joseph Hartman uh Hoffman and Gerald LaRue um
published by Prometheus books um a title of jesus and myth and history um in the late 1980s
and his uh contribution to it has uh basically starts out being like stop the pagan parallels
to stop um by the 1990s uh g.a wells actually came to a composite position so he no longer was
actually a traditional mythicist so as i went through in the first or in my first um lecture
on here uh uh mythicism is the position that there was not uh or most likely was not a historical
jesus of any kind um g.a wells took a composite position which was that there was a historical
jesus and there was also a mythical jesus that were combined this this i love this okay this was
the question i had when i first started the channel you know you go from like a fundamentalist
christian and trust me i've learned even as i've if you will deconvert it from christianity that
there are various forms of christianity i didn't realize that liberal christianity can allow you
to see things allegorical allow you to see mythology things like that and still believe the bible right
well i saw jesus and i said no i just don't buy i don't buy it anymore i don't buy that he actually
rose from the dead right so i have to understand like what does that mean he rose from the dead is
this a cognitive dissonance where a loved one they experience after he dies in some sense and then
they try to come up with a mythologized tale that he did he didn't die he rose from the dead or
something like that of barred airman type stuff or is it all fiction a part of a legendary tell and
stuff but i have to say i'm glad we got to this point because i can see a composite figure making
sense of details that are in the gospels but this is where i'm at chris is this i'm not drawing any
conclusions to say oh yeah he is a composite figure just because they may have borrowed from
josephus or something like that when you write a tale it doesn't mean they had in mind let's
combine all these different messianics and therefore we're just creating a composite
they might have like laid on top of some of the stuff from historical text of a real guy that
may have existed it doesn't mean there wasn't a guy and so to say it's composite i think it's
interesting that ga wells went there and he wasn't like strictly mythosus because i do see
jesus spin and anias you know saying whoa and and and we clearly see that with jesus in the gospels
and it's like okay is that complete fiction or did they borrow that from this jesus character to
kind of like lay it on on the layer of the gospel of jesus what is up with this so anyway i i have
the commentary because i know you're you're actually given the real history and you're
trying not to be biased and i know you're like look uh we can get into this if you want but i
want to move on in the history anyway that's for my audience just to let you know like it's good
to keep consideration that there may have been a guy and who knows a composite of figures even
not complete fiction you don't have to you don't have to be a dogmatic mythosist you can really
keep an open mind and consider the evidence which is what i'm doing so thanks for letting me say that
yep yeah and so uh wells is in my opinion probably one of the best exemplars and i really think that
people should really take his work more seriously than they do um he was very notable from the
standpoint that some at very famous academics did take him seriously seriously enough to seriously
to like physically debate him um uh for those that are familiar morten smith debated him
morten smith is the secret gospel of mark guy um jesus the magician that uh all that um he
debated j wells in the 1980s at the university of michigan and arbor um on whether or not
jesus existed and then debated him again in that edited volume um so yeah that he was a very
j wells is a very public figure he was also featured on a bbc um documentary which then
actually got or responded to by um james dg done um also rest in peace he died this year
one of the greatest new testament scholars hands down but um uh he he responded to him in the 1980s
in a book called um the evidence for jesus he was responded to by rt france in another book with us
with the same title um in the 1980s he was responded to by ian wilson um by um i marshal
howard and numerous others um and most recently was responded to by part airman and maryce kasey
um maryce kasey also passed away in 2014 for those that don't know um so yes uh he he was very
notable specifically for being very well versed in scholarship for having consistently evolving
views and for being very consistent also being pretty well known in the field enough to be responded
to quite frequently um his ultimate view was that the jesus in paul is a myth based primarily on
this personification and conception of jewish wisdom um and that jesus did exist as exemplified
in the q document but at some point in the past we don't really know when and that these two were
eventually merged into what we have in the gospels um so it was a it was a really interesting
thesis uh he passed away in 2017 um contemporaneously so we're now i'm going to go back again
because we have so many figures happening at once so that's again back in the 1970s almost
same time as a leg bro and uh wells in germany there's a different person rudolf augstein
people familiar with augstein know him from um der spiegel which is a political news outlet in
germany um he published a series of work of articles on whether uh or not jesus existed
and then he published a book called jesus son of man um this largely reiterates a lot of what
mythos from the past were saying so there's not a whole lot that's new to it and it's not
in my opinion worth getting into too much but it's notable specifically for the endorsements it got
um because it was not just endorsed by mythos it was endorsed by um uh david no uh not yet
try to remember the person specifically i think it was david noel freedman
who uh for those that don't know david noel freedman uh was a leading academic
in specifically old testament um uh yeah it sorry i was just confirming just to make sure
but yeah it was uh david noel for me leading scholar in old testament he was specifically
really influential um on the developing knowledge that we have of canonite religion
and how it relates to the old testament a lot um he has a had a massive bibliography but he wrote
the afterward to augstein's book you know when it was translated into english in 1977 um it was
interestingly enough also endorsed by gore vedal
who wrote the forward to the book and then in another place was also like another scholar
samuel sandbell uh who wrote what is a pinnacle of scholarship entitled parallelomania in the
journal of biblical literature um he he also was like yeah we should really check this out
and thank augstein for writing this so it got massive endorsements by leading academics world
over um but interestingly enough kind of just fizzled out it didn't make almost any impact
beyond that except a little bit in germany where it caused some controversy among pastors
who were like you're wrong but it it didn't get much beyond that than just brief mentions
for the most part um some german academics also reviewed it um and dismissed it but not much after
that um i cannot confirm this yet because i don't have a second edition of the book um but i have
heard that in the second edition he later changed his view to be a historicist um so he might have
made a big shift there as well um so now we're going so with that those are basically our big
figures in the 1970s during the 70s we also have um if i call loy graham who wrote a book called the
deceptions in the bible or something similar to that um it wasn't particularly at all well
received it didn't have like any notoriety um loy graham is also a pseudonym he claimed to be a scholar
of some kind but we have no idea who wrote it um so during during a time we don't have a whole lot
more the 1980s they're in the 90s then there's a huge pickup in mythicist literature like a massive
amount that pops up um 1980s we began having the work of barbara walker who is a um second-wave
feminist um thinker and she wrote uh books like uh the women's encyclopedia of religion and the women's
uh encyclopedia of secrets or something like that um i've got both of those volumes she recently
also had an edited volume of all a bunch of her essays put together um uh she became very
closely associated with dorothy murdoch actually also known as akari s yeah if she was still alive
i'd be interviewing her you know what i mean i really would i'd be shocked i actually kind of
speculate in my head sometimes because i have a very good friend of mine who introduced her to me
when i was first getting into this stuff and um he was close friends with her but i kind of wonder
where she would be at right now in her research you know what i'm saying like i kind of wonder
about that i did you ever meet her i did not unfortunately no that had been cool so it would
have yes um but yeah during the 80s we have we also have others um there were more writings
actually being written uh by in india by a few indian mythicists um the in china um actually
kotoku shutsui's work was translated for like a third time into chinese in the 1980s
no one knows why um the last major mythicist book in the soviet union was published in 1987
that was yosef krivlev's christ myth or reality and it was published in english
it's one of the very few mythicist works available in english um it's very hard to find
there is a pdf of it floating around on the internet but i have no idea where to find it
at the moment um so it basically other than that you have to hunt down an extremely rare
copy of a very niche soviet book which and that is the kind of there are a whole lot of in red
scare america that's what i was gonna say like that is stuff that you are best at like you really
have tons of these strange books that nobody will ever probably ever read yeah like uh
so i do have a small collection of like soviet mythicist work but i largely had to import this
from other countries in order to get my hands on it so like this came from russia uh this is
ranovic's work uh this is one of krivlev's from the 1960s this guy came from russia as well
these both this is um yekhov lenzman's origins of christianity and this is another book by krivlev
these are translated into french and these came from france uh and then this was actually a
mythicist soviet textbook used to indoctrinate children what that's awesome i got this from i
got this sent to me from germany so yeah it you basically have to import most of this stuff um
to get it but anyways um so back in the 1980s um so uh during this uh time in the united states
there's a there is some also pick up uh more mythicist works coming out um but they're not
getting a whole lot of attention yet um there are like some brief mentions of it so like um
in a book that kreg blomberg published in the 1980s uh he mentions it uh briefly just in footnotes
literally a footnote issue at the time um 1990s really start changing this a lot
so in the 1990s we have a number of academics that are beginning to respond to mythicists
more in full so karsten peter thied in um germany he was a pat he was a specialist on
pepperology he's specifically noted for peddling the conjectural pretty bad theory that the gospel
mark was found in a dead sea scroll fragment um it's been almost completely disproven by
actual by more analyses but uh he became noted because he wrote of um two books responding to
mythicists um the last one was published in the early 2000s right after he died it was published
post-humously first one was in the 1990s um simultaneously at the same time um murray j
harris who's a new testament scholar published three crucial questions uh about uh jesus or a
new testament or something like that that was published with width and sock um first chapter
of that deals with whether or not jesus existed and he argues that he did based on extra biblical
criteria um but then mythicists are also publishing en masse during this time a particularly
popular view that sprung up um was actually the astrological uh views of jesus so that he was
a personification of the sun and the twelve um uh apostles are the zodiac so it's basically just a
astrological play theme basically um there so there were a number of works like that like
from zine winter um akariya s very notably published the christ conspiracy during this time
malik jabbar um who is a who's a mythicist out of ohio um there and then also uh actually in
all the same year there were a number of mythicist books all published all of which are basically
instrumental for pushing it then into the mainstream more um all in the year 1999 they were they were
published um earl doe herdies the jesus puzzle uh akariya s the christ conspiracy and timothy
freaking peter gandy's the pagan uh the pagan christ or something like that or yeah yeah some of
some of the jesus mysteries that's what it was the jesus mysteries um so all three of them
published the same year 1999 and that published it pushed it into a lot of mainstream attention
for an amount of time but also during this time we have a very notable um series of publications
that are coming out um which is the journal of higher criticism journal of higher criticism
starts in the early 1980s it's sponsored by drew you uh drew university if i recall correctly um
it and the institute of higher criticism uh and it's edited by daryl uh dowdy and robert m price
um the first uh issue comes out with daryl dowdy's uh are basically
writing a publication that he where he doubts the authenticity of all of the polling epistles
daryl dowdy basically during this time is he's contemporaneous and simultaneously arguing
at the same time with herman datoring herman datoring over in germany is the the first of the
neo uh of the neo um dutch radicals in in my view um he basically come so you have uh herman
datoring i i just say datoring uh dr robert m price and well is it dr datoring dr datoring
yeah and dr price and then dr dowdy yeah okay so you have these three gentlemen that are all
kind of neo um yep all all becoming all would become neo dutch radicals okay robert price
actually would be the last of them to switch over um but uh the first of them is herman datoring
herman datoring writes his he wrote his entire dissertation on this which then got published
with peter long uh in 1992 and then daryl dowdy publishes in the journal of higher criticism
in english and then robert price uh follows not long after um so we uh basically the dutch radical
school is quasi revived oddly enough uh there are a few dutch um academics and theologians
that are still dutch radicals who are students of um vandenberg ben i senior who is the last of
the main group um and he died in the 50s but none of them had like any scholarly presence um
so datoring is the next to really launch them back into academia followed by uh dowdy and then
price and then this is basically follows the trajectory for the journal of higher criticism
the journal of higher criticism from that point on basically publishes a lot of things that probably
would not make it into most mainstream journals um but are nonetheless very interesting and i think
well working into with a lot of them um actually as one can see here i have an entire back catalog
of old issues of it um so then in the mid 1990s earl dowdy publishes in it um and also herman
datoring publishes his first english article in it uh which is the dutch radical approach to the
pauline epistles um and that uh basically um cements it in the english speaking world with at least
some of the mythosists that are going on um noteworthy though is that date datoring is not a
mythosist at this point and in fact in uh his uh book um uh early christianity in the twilight
the fabricated paul uh he actually explicitly states that he thinks jesus existed um that was
also translated into english by daryl dowdy and then published in um issue 10 uh two of the journal
of higher criticism as well and then later datoring also published it himself um in uh 2018
in english um so it is it's it's widely available on amazon for those that want to read it in english
and it's also available in german um so but uh datoring would actually later uh change his views
from those of being a historicist to a mythosist he would uh one of the last books he published
before his death uh argues that um so basically then going into the two we're now entering into the
2000s uh it's also worth note noting um i should actually backtrack a little bit because we we do
need to actually mention this one place and it's um american atheist um so that's a it's an atheist
and secularist organization that started by madeline mario herre um it's particularly noteworthy
because it has a long-standing association with publishing mythosist work um in fact it's one of
the most common places that mythosist stuff got published another common place being uh prometheus
books um a the uh american atheist um under madeline mario herre actually brought in john
allegro in the 1980s they were going to do a tour uh and speaking engagements over in england
and it actually turned into a whole fiasco because it was poor it was very very poorly managed
and uh also many of the speakers associated including allegro were misled by o'hair and others
um and it basically was bad enough that allegro uh dropped off of the circuit that they were going
to do um so that it went south needless to say um but this had been while they were pro during this
whole thing they had been uh promoting his work but then they just completely misled him uh
it was mishandled so bad um it this can actually be read about in the in the biography about um
john allegro it was written by his daughter um judith and it was published in erdmans in early
2000s so you can just go find that um but basically uh in then into the into the 80s they were also
publishing the work of john g jackson uh he was he was an afrocentric um academic um and wrote uh a
few uh works throughout his life on whether or not jesus existed um the main one that was really
popular was christianity before christ um which got its last edition right after he died in the
early 2000s uh published by american atheist also notable is um frank arsindler the editor of the
press uh primarily because he did a lot of his own publications and then also um he also translated
stuff into english uh it was pretty you know noteworthy because he did he translated arthur
dreads's work of the legend of st peter into english for the first time in the 1997 if i
recall correctly and that was published in the press um and then in the early 2000s so now we're
back to where we were so in in the early 2000s then frank arsindler publishes uh the jesus that
the jews never knew where he goes through all of the uh jewish writings on that talk about jesus
and he basically argues that it was either all knowledgeable of christian doctrine or were
interpolations and similar things and so there was like no independent evidence from um uh jewish
sources that jesus existed um another uh other works that were published around this same time
then and our year 2000 robert m price publishes deconstructing jesus um and then shortly after
he uh writes um the incredible shrinkings on a man um then we have and we have a few other
publications that start appearing um so we have primarily a lot of stuff from popular presses um
and this is also like the start of the self-publishing services um popping up so we start seeing that a
lot more um entering into uh the fray um but then we also see catching in the mainstream a little
bit more and catching academic attention again so deconstructing jesus was reviewed in a few
journals by academics um it was largely rejected for the most part um noteworthy also during this
whole time is that basically is the concept of the dying and rising god was for the most part
summarily refuted by academics um this started with uh jonathan z smith uh in the 1980s he wrote
he wrote an article that was published in the encyclopedia of religion edited by marcia elliott
and basically he argued that there was no dying and rising gods before christianity for the most
part um uh this was followed by marcus smith who is one of the leading um old testament scholars
out there uh and also a expert on canaanite religion and um he argued that um there were
probably not there was probably not a category of dying and rising gods and he specifically
presented a thesis that ba'al was not a dying and rising god but was actually the whole dying and
rising episode in the um ba'al cycle is actually a metaphor for the uh death and ascension of kingship
um and he based this off of a funerary text that they discovered um what ended up happening then
is that in the early 2000s then trick uh trick v mettinger uh publishes his work the riddle of
resurrection which mithesis today tried to uphold basically as like the pinnacle of dying and rising
god scholarship because it's like oh this definitely proves there were a dying and there was a
category of dying and rising gods um this is actually to the contrary um trick v mettinger
actually argues there was no single category of dying and rising gods there were gods that dying
rise but there was no category dying and rising gods um there was no he specifically argues
against there being an ideal type so he argues against basically what uh robert price argued for
in deconstructing jesus um uh but he he basically went through and he argued that marcus smith's
interpretation wasn't very good but he was pretty fair and he acknowledged that there were a lot of
problems with the dying and rising thesis for example there is no evidence of a dying and
rising ball all outside of hu gharat none that one text is all there is um he also acknowledged
that there is no um there's not really a lot of solid evidence for deities like ash moon dying
and rising um despite what previous academics had held not a whole lot he adamantly argues there is
none whatsoever for marduk um he agrees with uh past scholars that that was a political propaganda
piece not a piece reflecting a dying and rising god belief at all um uh he does argue osiris was
but he actually retracted that later in a review of another book he are he basically stated that he
concluded that osiris wasn't dying and rising dying and rising god actually um so it it was
it's a work that i think has been critically misused um since then um but anyways uh it was
very instrumental in rejuvenating that concept in mythicism again much to the chagrin of ga wells
this is uh this is a hot that's a hot topic within mythicism uh yeah it is you know and
it's something that i've had dear to me i mean even if there aren't types you know one of the
things that gets me like i i didn't know the field of of conversation here one of the things that
really grabbed me was people died and supposedly rose again from the dead like you know to me whether
it was and i know this gets complicated for anyone who watches and does not know some of the
stuff that christopher's talking about here this is extremely complex because is it talking about
a physical uh is it talking about an apotheosis type situation like there's a very there's varieties
of concepts is it agricultural there's so much stuff here that you can't wrap your head around uh
if you haven't really dug into this you won't really get the whole argument here that uh you're
bringing up but i think it's important that like when i came from christianity like all i thought
of is that there was only one guy who ever lived according to any tale ever that in some way rose
from the dead and of course the orthodox position is its physical literal body and of course that's
what it seems like the text says you know so regardless uh when i started finding out even
that there were other figures in history that may have had an apotheosis or some type of ascension
type thing to me that simple bit of my mind is like could this play a role and i don't know you
know this this is why methodology plays a huge uh importance in this because i am open to is this
a cognitive dissonance thing i mean they do say that like if i'm not mistaken everyone without
mental health problems like everyone who's got like a perfect record of no mental health still
experience their loved one 15 to 20 percent of them post mortem they experience them in some way
is that what happened and so anyway i leave that question mark for any of my audience who's watching
to think could this have been a great rabbi or apocalyptic teacher that they were loving they
loved so much that they thought that they really had experienced him and therefore everyone out
there is starting to fall in line with this so i don't know i don't know anyway yeah i'll shut up
so yeah uh basically though um marcus smiths and jonathan z smith's works um saw basically
solidified the fate of the dying and rising gods as being permanently dead in the eyes of academia
for the most part um there are other than trick trick may mettinger was basically one of the
only exceptions to this largely um there have been a few others since then but it's not at all
become um mainstream um the most recent uh have been scholars like john granger cook um
but uh basically uh despite that uh mettinger's work reinvigorated the concept uh greatly um
recontributed to it being brought back in mythicism in particular even though his epilogue
specifically argues that none of these deities can really be argued to be a parallel to jesus
actually um because they're all vegetative uh deities who are tied to agricultural conceptions
not to solvific elements um so what ends up happening after that is um there we enter into
the mid-2000s um a very controversial work came out it was called pagan christ by tom harper
tom harper had previously done graduate level at um uh education in new testament he was a
qualified academic he had taught new testament at university of toronto um in the 1960s and
then he became a journalist after that um uh and so but he wrote pagan christ in 2004 was
published and with uh thomas nelson um in uh nashville and it gained quite a lot of notoriety
especially uh in evangelical circles um it got a number of responses to in the mcmaster journal
theology uh and then also received an entire book in response to it as well uh by stanley
porter and steven j bidard and for those that don't know stanley porter is a leading scholar on
new testament um specifically on um uh methodology and historical jesus um uh so yeah it became
a very influential uh debate for the most uh from that perspective and it kind of reinvigorated
the whole debate especially between atheists and christians again um and that's kind of
where it has stayed a lot of in popular discourse um then uh not long afterwards was
announced the jesus project um jesus project uh was supposed to be basically like a sequel to the
jesus seminar in a way um it was headed by our joseph hoffman and robert price um but it there
was a lot of uh controversies about it uh robert price has talked about it before on here um but
one of the biggest controversies was its association with mythicism because there were a lot of
mythicists that were associated with the project including price frank zindler herman datoring
and then uh the uh well uh herman datoring was like on the fence at this point this is the mid-2000s
but then there's also hector avalos who at that point was an avowed agnostic on the concept
and then at one of the meetings um arthur droge announced that he was agnostic on the
idea that jesus existed arthur droge is a new testament academic um by the way um
so yeah we had there it was kind of controversial from that point of view and then there was also
the problem that just uh even even just aside from the fact that a lot of its membership was
questionable um there was the fact that its website instead of like linking to
a lot of academic sources would do things like link to mythicist blogs and mythicist forums
so it created a huge controversy that basically set the public against it pretty quickly and so
academics like mark goodacre and april de conic basically were like yeah we're not even getting
involved with this um so it it lost a lot of uh trucking power soon after our joseph hoffman in
one article was like uh our stated that there was also an attempt by some mythicist to try and have
like their own specified mythicist area in in it to study mythicist issues opposed to the
historicists so there's like or there's like apparently according to hoffman differing bridges
happening within it um it only produced one volume the sources of the jesus tradition
was published by prometheus books which also didn't help because prometheus books already had a
publish with publish had a history of publishing mythicist stuff and also it's not an academic press
um it was it was specifically a secularist press set up by paul curts so it the whole thing was
just a mess of publicity from the start the one book that got published didn't make a huge impact
it is notable however that there were a number of academics who are still involved in the
debate that were in it who are historicists so um very notably justin megeet um uh justin
megeet's work is uh absolutely excellent i highly suggest it uh yet uh last year he also
published an article specifically on uh it was a meta critical um uh paper on the whole debate
on jesus's historicity um but yeah so that the project basically fizzled out um but during
the same time there are a few other books published um in response to mythicists that are
still pretty influential today uh the first was by paul roads who's a leading scott he's a new
testament scholar and gregory boyd who's a theologian and very uh well-known um figure
on issues of theology and the bible um he the they published um the jesus legend um
which was a whole book arguing for the reliability of the synoptic tradition um and specifically
what was not notable about it um in particular um was the fact that the book um was not only
dense it's several hundred pages um it responded to various mythicists so specifically taking aim
at well's price and doerty um during this time then we also have a few brief responses happening
from like daniel wallis um and j ed kamazowski um we also have uh another work published which
has also been pretty influential um still uh and it's called the historical jesus five views
which was also edited by um james k bilby and paul roads eddie uh or paul roads sorry um and so
and uh basically um that work uh was noteworthy because literally the first essay in it is
robert prices um jesus at the vanishing point which people are probably also familiar with
because it was published in his um the christ smith and its problems um so but that so that
was that was published um there were a number there were four responses to robert price in it
from john dominant crossin um dale allison luke timothy johnson and james dg done um so four big
name new testament scholars basically right there um responding to price um it was published by
university academic press um we also have another publisher that has kind of had a little for a few
years anyways had like a little bit of a symbiotic relationship with um dr price um signature books
in utah it's a mormon press but it published both of his major works on uh promoting the dutch
radical ideas um it published um first uh the priest uh the pre-nicean new testament um which is
an absolutely massive tome i think i have yeah this mon this just it's massive this is a monster
you could kill your brother with this he might have written it for that very reason you just never
know you know sometimes there's a store assist you just gotta beat
but uh then uh then after that it published his amazing colossal apostle and so it was really
strange and actually there was a um one writer in a mormon journal uh it basically kind of got a
little uppity about it actually um it was uh and it was like the robert price in signature books
has this weird symbiotic relationship and it's not mormon enough basically i mean if you read
dr price you would be like hold on dude you know this doesn't line up with my faith yeah um but uh
then there's one thing that's worth noting and i hate to do it and i'm pretty sure most
mythosists here will hate that i have to bring it up but i do and it was zeitgeist
speaking of zeitgeist i don't want to spend too much time i actually told dr price he's never
watched it by the way which you can only imagine an old school guy like him he he always posts about
like zombie movies and frankenstein like he likes the classics and i'm like look you haven't seen it
and he said no i said i tell you what one of these days will get donations enough to spend the time
and just sit through it and we get your assessment i want your critical assessment and like i hope we
can get this because i think it's important to hear what he might say about it in light of the fact
that a lot of people are like dude there's a lot of issues that to take place with this um he said
i don't even know if i want to watch it so that sounds like well maybe we can get the donations
for people to like help you sit through and i'll record you responding to the video as it goes
we'll pause okay first of all i'll call baloney on that and here's why or whatever you know and
just comment on it but uh in the meantime yes i i've heard quite a negative views on zeitgeist
but i heard there's some things that are probably taken out of context and utilized on jesus that
are probably true in the ancient world about agricultural deities and connections to uh
some of the astro theological kind of stuff except something like you would probably go
there's a huge stretch they're taking probably what was known in antiquity like way way back
with these deities and they're trying to apply it onto jesus and do you think i wanted to ask you
about this when we were passing by acharya and the astro theology movement that was making an
uprising in the early late 90s early 2000s um do you think there's fragrance i guess to give it
like there's scent in the air so to speak somewhere within the new testament of an astro theology
but that it's not this strange devil's pulpit the whole thing is this code and it's all written
i don't buy that but do you think there's some astrology these hints of agricultural
aspects but it's not that it is an agricultural text does that make sense like do you think
there's something there there's definitely there's definitely astrological work in the bible um
there's a lot in in the old testament um samson for example probably or actually one of the best
examples actually is isaia 14 12 through 15 that's the whole narrative of halal ben shahar so the
the morning star translated in greek lucifer so that whole thing actually makes use of
astrological conceptions of the of deity so um basically uh he uh the the the those that don't
know it's a it's a um canaanite myth that's been applied to nebuchadnezzar if i remember correctly
i can't remember don't quote me on that but anyways i know this part anyways uh so it's
probably in my opinion and in the opinions of john day and um oulf oldenberg and a number of others
is talking about the god aftar but aftar is basically identified by the uh plant but by the
star he is associated with i.e venus um the morning and uh evening star um he's also being
associated and then he's also being uh associated with trying uh with the polemic of trying to climb
above the stars of l and so this is a very common theme is that gods are associated with um planetary
movements in a lot of ways um it starts uh it's not that present in the new testament but there are
like at least some at like items in the new testament that attests to at least not like uh
awareness of star movement and star and at least veneration that would be probably where the problem
comes in i say is like there's it's like black or white either or and so often like if you see
little pieces they kind of go what are we not seeing the whole thing must be hidden secrets
and that's we're rabbit trolls yeah that's what sand mel colt would have characterized as another
episode of parallel mania and i personally don't find the astrological views um convincing
most of the academic mythos never did um i'm gonna i'm gonna quote um yosef krivlev in christ
smith or reality but it more resembles mental gymnastics i find i can respect that because
i understand why people do it i just asked that those people and i asked those who are watching
right now um who might believe this they might believe what you're saying you don't believe
right um i want them to just understand that like look uh who knows right we could be wrong
or you could be wrong and i say that to say keep an open mind continue to research keep
studying don't take offense you know you're not trying to jab at somebody you have an opinion
and you do conclude different opinions then you disagree with me like you are more certain there
was a jesus where i'm like i can see it and then i'm like back and forth tug of war sometimes but
like i do see that as a thing and we're really good friends like we're not enemies at all because
that like what you think about attacks shouldn't reflect how you discuss in the situation but anyway
um you were getting a zeitgeist so i kind of really took you off track actually actually it's
actually fine because zeitgeist basically um really works from um the work of akari asked a lot um
and she later wrote the source book for it actually um along with um the director um and so it's
well worth bringing up actually um zeitgeist basically promoted astro theological idea that
jesus was a smith based on the stars it takes and it takes a lot from the christ conspiracy
and this is where i need to bring up a lot of the theories that they were bringing up that they were
making use of are really bad um and it's not because necessarily that the argument is a
bad argument but it's because the evidence they're using is not actually evidence um this was a
major criticism of akari asked and this one that she tried to somewhat resolve in later books but
she still fell into it a lot was this use of a lot of old 19th century writers a lot of old 19th
century mythicist writers who didn't quite know what they were talking about one of these and the
most pertinent well there's two the two that are most pertinent here are gerald massie and alvin
boy kuhn um gerald massie was a self-taught egyptologist i hate using that word because and
i'm not kidding virtually every egyptologist on the world disowns him um uh he could not really
actually read hieroglyphs and he also fabricated a lot of stuff so um he is where the nonsense
ideas of jesus being baptized by a noob the baptizer started or the idea that he that osiris
had 12 disciples and a bunch of other nonsense like that um some of it was based off of him
misreading the hieroglyphics and then a lot of it was based on him just making things up
but it got popular and it got popular um because then alvin boy kuhn used it alvin boy kuhn um
not a uh a biblical scholar in any way he was actually a theosophist um i'm not going to get
into what theosophie is because it's really complicated you can just look it up um but it's
basically like a kind of spell it form real quick just so they can look it up ph eo s o ph y theosophy
it's it's basically a spiritualist religion it was started by helena bolivotsky in the 1800s um
alvin boy kuhn uh is notable specifically because he got a phd in theosophy columbia is also going
to come up again because it's the alma mater of another mythicist who's very popular now um
but basically uh he wrote numerous books they were almost all self-published um and they had
basically no notoriety during his life he died in the um 60s if i recall correctly um
uh the only place where they had much of any influence were in theosophist movements um
but then they were picked up again by akariah s in the 90s and then also by tom harper uh
tom harper based the pagan christ largely off of the work of massi and off of kuhn um and kuhn
is noted uh he's again in that school of looks alike is alike when it comes to linguistics
um so for example he tries to argue that the spanish work um the spanish article uh la l
meaning the comes from the um hebrew l meaning god because they look the same
and then he tries to argue that our um article the comes from the word theos in greek meaning god
he has a lot of just absolute nonsense like that and it's strewn throughout he
did not cite things very well this was a habit of a lot of those schools is that they didn't cite
things very well and when they did usually went to a bad source like massi and so this is what
basically plague zeitgeist zeitgeist and this is why you get things like the idea of mithras
being a dying and rising savior god who had 12 disciples and stuff no he didn't with no evidence
of any of it um and if you want to act like and it's to the it's actually gotten to the place now
where it was bad enough that lots of of the more credible mithasists had to like hammer this back
into the ground because they're like stop you're giving mithasists a bad name
so zeitgeist kind zeitgeist nakari s and tom harper kind of like created this huge split in
mithasism and a huge amount of infighting occurred um and robert price was actually
part of this robert price wrote a scathing review of the christ conspiracy which he later
regretted um he later came to the conclusion basic uh in one of his other reviews of akira's work
that we should like team up even if we disagree and not like point out all the faults and stuff
that's a whole that's a whole methodological thing that i might get into but anyways um
there was a uh robert price also wrote a pretty scathing review of tom harper's work
and all and then zeitgeist basically became the fuel of um evangelical apologist's world over
to be like look how stupid mithasists are um because it was just a bad documentary and it was a bad
it was bad research is bad bad sources um and it said a bunch of things that are just ostensibly
not true so it gave them a lot of fuel to basically really really hammer mithasists down a lot um
and it made it a lot harder for mithasists i think to get much recognition which is why i bring it up
to because despite the fact that it's such a negative part of mithasism to the street it is
important in like the public perception of it um uh but it got basically rejected by most
of the leading mithasists out there got rejected it got lambasted by carrier and others so it's
most of the more of what we consider a lot of the more credible mithasists have basically
just turned their backs to that sort of thing um what and so then entering into the 2010s
where the most major stuff recently happens um there's a number of really important stuff things
published um so firstly we have um uh uh sorry uh it is uh actually real quick in 2009 um Richard
Carrier publishes one of his first books on the issue not the impossible faith um which has become
a little bit instrumental late lately he he cites it a lot in his um other books um it was a
self-published book through lulu um but anyways um in 2012 Bart Ehrman publishes did jesus exist
um though there had been quite a few and um i will actually provide you the link with it but
i have a huge bibliography of mithasist works and responses to mithasists um there's been over 90
responses to mithasists since the 70s um but basically despite the fact that there were
quite a few responses none of them were particularly um publicized in a popular way
in a way that got a lot of recognition this is where Bart Ehrman's work comes in because did
jesus exist was published in 2012 again and published by harper one and at the time Bart
and to this current day Bart Ehrman has been one of the most well-known public uh new testament
scholars out there he's coming off with the fame of misquoting jesus jesus interrupted and a bunch
of other books which have been which were just absolutely uh insanely well received by the
public and so he writes did jesus exist his response to the idea to mithasist
um for me the book is a mixed bag um i think there's a lot of good things in it i think there's a
lot of things he could have done better i don't like the fact that he argues using hypothetical
sources um i think he's very right to call out that the extra biblical sources aren't that useful
for jesus um but anyways um the book was very was was very popular most people uh liked it and
accepted it it became a main it's become kind of a mainstay especially by evangelicals um
um uh but it did not sit well with the mithasist that much and it got a full massive treatise
response by um frank zindler earl doe herdie renae salm uh robert price richard carrier
akariah s in an edited volume um called bart airman in the quest for uh the historical jesus of
nazareth and that was published in american atheist again um uh and uh basically was super
it was super controversial to say the least um renae salm at the very least like thanked bar
airman for at least making the issue known enough to warrant responses and um mithasist were at
least accepting of the fact that airman um quite right in my opinion rightfully held that mithasist
should be actually responded to by academics and they should not just be ignored and sidelined um
then the same year and with an epilogue that responded to airman was the first peer-reviewed
mithasist book of the 21st century and that's thomas l brody's uh the quest beyond the the
beyond the quest for the historical jesus published by sheffield ben express um the book
is basically a memoir of how he came to conclude that jesus never existed uh which he came to
in the 1970s it is really worth noting that brody did not know of any other mithasist literature
at that time he came to this conclusion completely independently it's also well worth noting that
he's not an atheist he's a christian and he holds to be a he's he was a dominican priest and he
still holds to be a dominican catholic in spite of the fact that he thinks jesus didn't exist
um this is a long tradition in mithasis actually um j van den berg van asinja was a pastor
and so were a number of other of the uh dutch radicals um albert keltoff was a pastor
as well um then there's also uh william brough william montgomery brown uh who is a marxist um
and episcopal priest and one of the first of the 20 of the 20th century to be tried for heresy
but um but uh and then most recently has been um um edward van der kage in the netherlands who's
also a mithasist and he's also a pastor his views are largely based off of the jesus mysteries by
freaking gandy um so there's a long tradition of christian mithasis actually um and oftentimes
what i see if they're not christians uh or they don't claim christian um some might they're new
ages in some sense they're spiritual mithasist and they sound just like christians uh to me
the way that i've listened to a lot of them communicate i mean i've i've watched uh some
lives about one guy named mithasist on facebook i'll leave his name unknown um but it's extremely
like he goes into these little lives on his facebook there's only like two or three people
watching but he like goes into these long prayer chants and stuff like he sits there and he just
like for a while and i'm thinking okay it's not necessarily an academic thing uh for these guys
there's maybe they have some reason why they really think uh why they want to argue that way
if you will uh for jesus not existing it's not about any evidence whereas like for me it's not
one might go well you're biased you don't want christianity to be true and i've had people
actually try to say that of me um i don't think that christianity is true uh not in any ontological
sense uh you know i don't think that a guy actually rose from the dead i don't believe in those things
anymore um the question of whether he existed became a seriously curious one for me because
i started seeing that there are mythologies of the world you know like i didn't even know about
mythologies like that i mean never took serious that real greeks in some time in the past thought
zeus and apollo were real beings that actually existed at some point you know things like that
just just those ideas was like how could someone actually believe those things were true and so
i started to come out of it and maybe went to the far extreme starting with the he didn't exist
in everything and and all of its astro theology and it's all a myth and everything and i did go
that path um to sweeping away i always refer to it as like i'm on a dirt lot playing a soccer game
and i start to find out there's a concrete basin underneath this and i'm sweeping or
there's some bones i'm finding dinosaur fossils and i'm like whoa hold on there's some meat to this
i didn't know and so that's kind of in my own journey but uh anyway i don't want to stop you
anymore because we're already getting quite far into this yeah so um uh basically this is just to
say uh i want i'm sorry i said not all mythosus erathias though the vast majority of them are and
the vast majority of them are also ex christians on top of this um but i i'm not saying this as any
kind of aspersion or to cat or to like dismiss them like um merese casey kind of did it's i i know i
try to know more for sociological study reasons it's like okay well a lot of them are are ex christians
a lot of them are and atheists and now mythosus there are also um in the new pagan communities
um um mythicism has been somewhat popular as well sorry uh so yeah um anyway uh anyways basically
thomas brody's work is was pretty noteworthy it caused a big scandal in the dominican order
he became one of only two academic mythosus i know of the other being bruno bower
to ever lose um academic privileges over mythicism um he got basically banned from
teaching and writing by the dominican order um uh because um well mythical jesus's are not usually
part of catholic uh in dominican tradition dominican order tradition so uh yeah
yeah he he did it didn't fare well for him um but basically after that then there is um
somewhat a little bit of a lull um uh i think in 2012 or 2013 though um rafael lachester um in
australia uh public basically passes his master's um thesis which was on the uh uh
him basically evaluating mythicism um then in 2014 we have two big ones we have marie's casey's
jesus um evidence this is one came up first evidence in our argument or mythosus myths
um published by bloomsbury bloomsbury the burry is particularly notable because it is a very well
known and very very well respected publisher on religion and biblical issues um but uh his work
largely took aim not at academic mythosus but of the more popular ones um really took aim at
like herald leidner uh who was a lawyer he passed away in the early 2000s um acria asked freaking gandy
and others um and then he also noteworthy uh is his introduction to the to this uh basically his
who's who um in the debate and it's a mixed bag to say the least um
but then the same year uh is then richard carrier's uh tome on the history of jesus in 2014 um it was
published by sheffield phoenix press um it it it's been heralded as one of the
the great achievement for peer review it's uh carrier argues that it is um the um first peer
reviewed uh case for mythicism and an alternative start for christianity it's not actually 1993
the first one is john magnate uh who published in brown steak studies series and it was endorsed by
jakem newsner um well it's uh from it called uh from nosus to cranny christianity and from christianity
to nosus um for those interested um i don't think it's in print any longer but you can find used
copies of it fairly cheaply um so that was actually the first um and then but anyways his is by far
the most um the most comprehensive um his work basic his art his his book is in a school of thought
which uh i i i identify there being various schools of thought and mythicism um so the
astro theological school that is uh current today is a unification of um two older schools of thought
so there was the the french astrothiologists and then they kind of fit and then with akariah
s they're really unified with the egypt centrists uh like massi and basically became an egypto
astrothiological um school of thought and we see that uh now most recently with um pier two leap
and then the second edition of the christ conspiracy by akariah s edited by uh robert price um
um the other thing the the thing with carriers is carriers comes out of a uh out of the french
the schools as well but out of a different one um this one is primarily founded by paul louis
kushu who we talked about before um and then it's funneled through uh ga wells and then through ga
wells and paul louis kushu we get url doherty's work and then carriers is basically the successor of
url doherty um in fact it's eerily similar on most levels um the argumentation is largely the same
so it's basically um they both use the ascension of isiah base to make the case that there were
conceptions of jesus as a purely celestial being um existing in the heavens who dies and
who's died and crucified in this sub lunar realm and outer space
no i don't like carriers you're not a fan of uh this mythicism i am not a it's not that i'm not a
fan of the mythicism it's not a fan of the language um because it's just really weird um
but anyways um he basically the idea is that jesus dies um between like the firmament and earth
it in up there uh he never comes to earth he's just a purely celestial being um and that that's
how paul originally um uh refers to him and then um he argues on the bit i should have mentioned
this earlier just a brief note as predecessors to this there's also an edited volume um is this
not the carpenter by thomas thompson and thomas verena which has a bunch of mythicist works in it
by robert price times and thomas verena as well as responses thomas verena's work is the one that's
most pertinent here because carrier uses um verena's allegorical readings of various passages to
argue that paul is just allegorizing a celestial jesus that there was no historical jesus in paul's
writings um of course relations chapter four with the the mother above these arguments of
him being born of a woman oh well what woman the woman from above which is mother it's not a
literal biological mom but making an allegorical uh right and stuff and on and on yeah and then like
romans one three he argues that uh the word genomenals there he argues literally means to make or
manufacture and that jesus is manufactured out of the sperm of david which was stored in the heavens
in a quote cosmic sperm bank unquote um uh but anyways um that that's basically like the basic
thesis there's other things that are interesting about carrier's work um he tries to reinvigorate
the dying and rising god um in it but it doesn't really serve a huge purpose that i can see
in his work honestly he can make his case without it in my opinion it's kind of just there um
he also argues that phylo has this pre christian jesus um in his work on the confusion of tongues
and this is largely based on um carrier's uh conjecture that phylo conceptualized this heaven
his logos as this um figure jesus in the book of zekariah the book of but the lxx makes it clear
that the person that builds the temple in zekariah 12 and 13 i.e the branch isn't actually jesus
it's zaruba bell which you read in the previous two chapters and then also in verse 13 anyways
it's it's a real a really weird thing um it's not been well received it was actually argued
against by larry hertado and by joel edmund anderson um uh but um basically um his thesis
is uh just that purely celestial jesus dies crucified in heavens um and what's really
notable about his work and probably the in my opinion the most noteworthy thing is his attempt
to apply a new methodology um to the issue of um historicity and it's by the use of basian
probability theorem and um for those that don't know it's basically it's a probability theorem
basically meant to assess the likelihood of x happening and so um the first thing you have
to do is like assess your prior probability carrier does this by making use of the roglin
archetype he argues that there's no historical figure that scores um 11 above 11 points so
basically the cutoff is 12 if you get 12 or more you're most you're you have a prior probability
of being most likely mythical because all the figures that score above 12 are usually mythical
figures so like osiris romulus um uh uh mithra um uh osiris romulus uh
zelmoxis and other yeah i think he's just actually wouldn't score that highly on it because we don't
have very much at all on zelmoxis i just throwing the name out because i didn't know if that was one of
anyways he he basically there's just 15 figures on this jesus is one of them at best jesus has a
33 chance of having uh for his prior probability and then the uh the low is like extremely low
and then after he goes through everything he makes an argument from silence for the extra
biblical sources which is a pretty standard mithist argument it's probably the most universal one
it's when you can find in china japan india the soviet union germany everywhere that's probably
the only universal mithist argument um uh and then argues the gospels can't be used as good sources
because uh they're basically just myth um and then our and then he goes into the epistles and argues
that those are most likely talking about celestial being so then we cut so that's his main conclusion
um carrier's work has been lauded by mithesis as probably one of the best works for mithism out
there um it has been pretty much condemned by most academics um the only exception to this
is rafael lotister who's agnostic on jesus's historicity um he published the first review of
it if i recall correctly in the journal of religion um which is a very positive review
of usir tuckard who is the only other major proponent i know of who argues basing probability
can be used for history um but he basically argues that uh carrier should have uh that carrier was
too dismissive of other methodologies uh for assessing jesus's historicity and so he doesn't
really agree with carrier necessarily on this um christina peterson um she is a uh she's a new
testament scholar and then also she studies christianity um it's like in the 18th and 19th
centuries a lot um she's noted for like works like this um from two texts and stuff like that
but anyways um she wrote a review of his uh of on the historicity of jesus and relegera
and was scathing um she referred to um carrier's work as not she basically was like nothing in
this work shocked me it was pretty uh rudimentary first year new testament stuff
was how she referred to it in her review um carrier got extremely upset with this and
actually tried to claim that she was a christian she's actually an atheist she's actually a marxist
atheist um so he was like very wrong um but it it goes into there is i'll go into this a little
bit later but there's a really there's a real polemical attitude in this debate that's i think
really unhealthy uh for it actually progressing um but anyways after carrier's work um which was
pretty noteworthy um for being like the first peer review text even the the peer review process
that went on in his book has come under some scrutiny um after that actually sheffield
phoenix press had like his whole shift of management um that occurred um and i have
heard from some people i can't name sources but carrier's book has kind of been viewed like the
the unfortunate side of the press by its latest managers and stuff so it's not it's not taken
highly unfortunate unfortunately it's not really dealt it's not worked with much at all either in
academia um there have been a few other rebuttals uh to carrier by simon gayther cole and daniel
galada um both of the both of them and the journal for a study of uh his study of the
historical jesus um carrier's paper the carrier's argument that the tacitist passage was um in
authentic has also been um uh rebutted to by willem blom in the july christianne as well
um so there's been a lot of stuff that's been made in response to in response to him there's
not been a whole lot of acceptance of most of his ideas um one that has caught a little traction
actually is his identification um um there's uh there's he has a little bit in the uh on
his history of jesus on the star and the magi in the gospels and that idea has actually gotten a
little bit of recognition more um so it's it's not all negative that's happened but it is mostly the
case um rene song then in 2015 published a new book so he's public he published previously a book on
the idea that nasa earth never existed in the first century and he published another one in
2015 called nasa earth gate um that it has since been rejected by almost every single archaeal
actually i think every single archaeologist that he has ever that has ever talked about the issue
has basically explicitly rejected his work um most the most um public on this has been ken dark
who as recently as this year rejected psalm's stuff again um uh then um herman datering continued
publishing more works he argued he wrote a book basically um arguing against any of the sources
for jesus being authentic he then wrote another book um arguing that none of the letters of
st augustin are authentic um and then he his final works were basically on the history of jesus and
he argued that jesus didn't exist um and then um datering uh passed away in 2018 he had been suffering
from uh i believe cancer and he hadn't really told anyone um so he sadly passed on uh then
basically after that there's not a whole lot yet academically going on um there are more
mythicis works that were published uh there's been a like don't get me wrong there's been a
absolute mass of mythicis works published um populary um it is worth noting in 2018 the
journal of higher criticism was restarted it's no longer endorsed by an university and it's not
peer reviewed but it is been uh restarted by um dr price and alex crittle um has the main editors
um and it has had a number of academics still that have published in it like christian lintner
christian lintner is also a mythicist he's a boot he he's a professor of buddhist studies um
he was associated with the university of copenhagen uh which is the same one that thomas l thompson
is associated with um he uh but he basically argues that paul and jesus never existed and
there's like a uh it's a really complicated mathematical cipher and stuff uh based on buddhism
and sanskrit and things it's really complicated um but i don't think he's ever published any
books on the matter i could be wrong on that but i haven't seen any um but uh so yeah like christian
lintner's published in it i believe russell gemurcan is going to have an article in the journal
of higher criticism i've had um two in the journal of higher criticism before um so anyways um going
on from that then uh from 2018 in 2019 come some very notable developments and these are basically
some of the most recent uh until uh yesterday i think um so uh in 2019 uh where was the next
peer-reviewed book advocating uh questioning jesus's historicity uh this is questioning the
historicity of jesus by rafael attester uh published with um uh ridopi uh which is an uh
publishing imprint under brill um uh this book is
on it i do have a copy of this book it's unfortunately extreme
where is it anyways it's unfortunately really expensive it's like $210
um jeez yeah it so it's like not affordable under any metric at all um but uh base this
is following a ton of like papers that a lot of stories published and also he had published
two he'd done two self-published books through create space um both both which he took down
jesus did not exist and there was no jesus and there was no god and then he published his
dissertation which is the case against theism um and that was published in the academic press
springer uh and also has a brief chapter on uh why jesus may not have existed um but questioning
the historicity of jesus was is basically supposed to be kind of a medic critique of the debate in a
way um so he had so he basically um uh the first he has he has his introduction his introduction
is very strange um and very polemical uh he he basically critiques a new testament scholars
who call out the fact that a lot of mythesists are unqualified and he tries to make the case that
all new testament scholars are unqualified to talk about the history of jesus
funnily enough very coincidental and very lucky for latester though uh analytical philosophers
like latester are definitely qualified for it it's funny how those things work out when you
have a narrative right a little bit but uh there's other things that are really obvious about it
that he has a narrative like he has an entire section where he wants to argue that christians
should be excluded from the debate um he also he and then his next section is uh the case for
historicity where he examines marie's casey and bart airman's works and he's very insulting on a
regular basis accuses them of being like liars and hacks and stuff like that um it's very very harsh
then in the net uh in the next section is the case for agnosticism he's in he's an agnostic
it's and then after that's a case for mythicism both of them are very very reliant on the works of
our richard carrier uh for the most part like most of all of his interpretations and ideas are
based on carrier occasionally he steps into dutch radical realm which is really interesting um so
i think he recognizes that some of carrier's interpretations of paul are are strained so
he instead actually posits that they could be interpolations and so he's falling back on like
the work of dowdy and the work of robert m price um the the ways he does this is usually by appeal
to marcian which has a lot of methodological problems but i'm not going to get into those um
because it's a long thing but anyways that's the most recent peer reviewed work on the matter
it has received one very short review um but the review the reviewer was basically
of the opinion that the work is interesting and would probably be notable for mythesis but academics
will probably overlook it um it's only been published for a year now so there's not a
whole lot to say yet um i know for a fact that james migrath has received a view review copy of it
and is planning to produce a review of it um so we're going to probably see that but i haven't
seen it cited in any academic literature since then um other books that have been published
though since then are um works like uh michael laurance has published a book on his theory
on the early christianity um there have been there uh and then uh entering into 2020 there
are a few notable things that have come out the one of the most uh uh probably in my opinion one
of the most interesting is uh the second edition of the christ conspiracy by akariya s um it was
like her final wish that that book could be redone because it's kind of it was really badly
lambasted um and so um dr price and a few others got together basically to edit it and
um help set a second edition up for it um and so that was published this year in i believe march um
and then uh at the next most notable thing which i believe came out either yesterday or the date
before it might have been the day before it might have been tuesday anyways the most recent one
is and also probably the silliest named in all of these is the one and only jesus from outer space
um by richard carrier um it is and it's basically just an abridged popular version of on the history
of jesus there's not much new occasionally he responds to um some of his latest critics but
other than that there's not a whole lot of changes but that came out just recently and so the only
thing other other that's really worth noting are the fact that there have been a pickup of debates
by uh like public debates on the history of jesus um a well-publicized one was at mithesis
milwaukee in 2016 um and it was between robert price and barred airman but there's been others
um uh richard carrier um debated um um uh uh denis mcdonald um and uh for those that aren't aware
it was um partially based on the fact uh that carrier used a lot of denis mcdonald's work in
ohj and denis mcdonald's and eggs always take kindly to that because he felt his views were a
little misconstrued um carrier is also debated mark goodaker um he has debated zeba crook
and craig evans as well so there's been some pretty high profile debates going on
in spanish academia there's also been a number of others as well um there was an edit volume in 2008
called it uh that was edited by antonio pinheiro uh and it was a collection of essays from
several academics including one of my favorites fernando bermello rubio um uh on the history
of jesus and then he recently did a third edition to one of his main books on it uh that was published
in 2018 or 2019 um as well and so there's actually been a number of span of spanish academics
involved in this issue um it's definitely not calmed down there at all there was one there's
been one main french academic i know of uh who's been involved but he's not a but he's not a
biblical scholar he's a philosopher and it's michelle onfrey um who argued based on the works
of ga wells that jesus didn't exist um but to my knowledge it didn't receive like any recognition
really um other than it got a few like uh there were a few news outlets that commented on it
but other than that it died it died out um pretty quickly french academics are basically
unanimous that jesus existed german academics i think just for the most part pretend that this
debate doesn't exist um it's really a big thing though in the uk and america and australia um
it is the case that mythicism is most certainly on the rise in the popular audiences um third a recent
poll by barnard group estimated that about 39 percent of england doubts whether jesus existed
39 percent that's over one third in the united states it's over eight percent
and in australia there are around 90 to 100 000 people that doubted jesus existed so um there's
several there's tens of millions of people in those three countries i think that jesus
may not have existed i would happen guess uh actually i know from a fact that from james
mcgrath that it is still occasionally promulgated in romania um romania was under the so was very
influenced by the so by the soviet union and communist regimes um there are occasional
comments on it in czechoslovakia um czechoslovakia was actually had its own major debate on whether
or not jesus existed basically it was in the 1980s there's a whole conference on it actually
among academics and they're all like yeah he existed um and then um i'm gonna guess that it's
probably still a thing among popular audiences in russia and in china it is um still occasion
is still published on in india there is um the prime minister of um uh if i remember
i believe it was syria might be wrong on that one of the prime ministers over there in the
middle east uh actually stated that jesus didn't exist um in there was a there was a president
there was a presidential um candidate in i believe it was finland again uh
not off the top of my head anyways uh but she basically lost the election because she
thought jesus may not have existed i mean look look i have to say we're we're here now right
we're at 2020 you missed one of the most important things though myth vision podcast
has played a huge role well i i'm gonna get to that because actually because um popular
yeah i think that probably one of the most uh one of the ways that it's probably spread the
fastest has been through um popular outlets like myth vision um also among especially among um
but also especially among youtubers in the atheist community um so arne raw um godless
engineer are two very those are two very notable examples of this who have promoted these views
arne raw in particular uh with his associations with richard carrier i must say and we're getting
close to the end of the hour you know so um give us a few more and i'll give you some closing
statements or give us whatever you'd like to top off with yeah so um i'm just actually gonna
close it with what i hope for the future i think that there's something to be said that we need to
actually correct a lot of the discourse going on not from the standpoint that i think that
necessary that we need to like correct the ideas but the way that discourse is actually done so
um for example rafael attester's work is very clearly anti christian he thinks christians should
be excluded from the debate explicitly he explicitly states that um he all richard carrier
has a habit of very frequently lambasting of verbally abusing uh his opponents who criticize him
and it's also indicate and there's also there are a few rhetorical techniques that are used as
well so like when you go into their works you'll notice that um there are several times where
they just refute where they refer to their co two colleagues who are phd academics as apologists
and the reason that that's done is because when you refer to various academics or figures as
apologists in the atheist community um and this has actually been shown in studies it
automatically takes away from any chances of them being taken seriously um i think that there's
there's a desperate need to refocus that um there has also been the case that if you notice um
mo almost all the popular mythicists are usually men usually white guys um it is very seriously the
case that uh people of color are almost never talked about rafael latches are the only ones
out there and women are almost never talked about and it's not only the and it's not only
the case i'm doing virtue signaling here or anything but it's actually a very real problem
from the standpoint that if they're not their words are not being talked about it's not being
evaluated it's not being fairly discussed and if it's not being discussed then they're just being
ignored and i think that's unfair and a lot that actually comes from both historicists and mythicists
i'm not like uh historicists have a lot to do with the with the way this discourse has gone
as well moray's case his work is extraordinarily um um just spiteful of mythicists and people who
doubt the history of jesus and he just regularly lambasts and attacks them and insults them
throughout it is not pretty he did not contribute positively to the interactions at all and i think
that there's a need to completely reframe this because i think that's basically where it is right
now is that this is not necessarily even an academic debate it is with the rhetoric and the
way it's framed right now it is a debate between people that don't like christianity and people that
do interesting and i think that needs to be reframed it's not that i'm saying that any of
their ideas are wrong i think that the way that both sides have framed this is bad and as part of
the reason why i'm wanting to actually write why i've been writing a history mythicism is
because i want this issue to be taken seriously i want academics to actually take mythicists
seriously and to take these and take and debate these opinions for real and i think that the
one of the best ways to do that is that we look at a lot of the works that have come out um and
take what's good and treat the rest as a warning you're not going to have a conducive atmosphere
when you're when you act like richard carrier and every single person you don't like you call a
hack a liar a pseudo scholar and stuff like that or how he does with even other mythicists
he referred to akarias as a pseudo-intellectual and he gaslighted her about a lot of stuff too like
um we very well know that akarias was very unfairly treated by most of the mythicist community
and the historicists out there and it let and it was really bad she was just attacked from all
circles she was attacked in very sexist ways she was attacked her intellect was assaulted everything
and in one of his articles on on his blog richard carrier was like no it's a myth you just think
people are out to get you he's like no they were and know that she spoke about that for sure and
i know that discourse she had with dr price over time helped like he was reasoning with her with
some of her stuff like you would agree would be like whoa you know you went off the deep end
but he kind of reeled her back on some of those ideas and of course he is a mythicist so you
you can only imagine from your view because this is the thing we have different views
that we're discussing here even from your view even if dr price goes too far and he's too critical
like he doesn't allow certain evidence to even be weighed in it because he says interpolation or
whatever um he still reeled her in some and over time she shifted some of her views which i can't
imagine like that's what i said earlier i can't imagine what she would be thinking today with
the research and who knows she might be like you know what jesus agnosticism or there might have been
a guy or a composite figure whatever who knows where he where she would be at right now um i've
seen the videos of her i've read a little bit of her and i would be shocked uh i wouldn't be shocked
to find her changing her views over and over um we're wrapping up here so i want to say i think
everything that you said in this is honorable and it's needed i think anyone can turn around
right now um from any potential because i've never had any issues i'm actually good friends with all
sides i'm good friends with everyone from all sides historicist mythicist agnostic on the position
composite figure you name it and i choose to always be friends with everyone because i don't
know where i'm gonna be at in five ten years and i don't think if i tried i could read all the books
that you've read in the rest of my lifetime you're very well read you know the arguments you've heard
this stuff and and just i wish i could read as well as you um myth vision i hope hasn't contributed
in a negative way we've made public the arguments we've allowed the people to speak and say what
they think and why and i've even entertained some of these theories to believing them not saying that
i conclude them but i've entertained them i'm also bringing in more and more the historic aside
because i'm finding there i want to be a balanced show i'm not mythicist vision i'm myth vision
and the reason i want to be balanced is because i don't know if i'm right on concluding he's
complete myth i do think there's good reason to believe there was a guy i don't think that's crazy
in fact there's a good reason most of the scholars agree with this and i'm not doing it because a
majority i couldn't care less if 99 of scholarship out there said well i believe in a historical
jesus and let's say 99 of it was christian okay well maybe their their orthodox position could
weigh in their respect of what they think and i know that this is the polemic right they use this
and people always bash each other i'm just making the point like consensus isn't the reason why i'm
making these decisions i'm truly trying to figure it out and i'm thinking there really could be a guy
christ i'm not i'm not i promise you man like too often the non-religious mythicist act religious
in their thinking and they want to bash the religious when they themselves are dogmatist on
the position not even really entertaining with a with an open mind could there be a guy no they're
already closed off they already interpolated everything everything's already not good evidence
everything like what if that evidence is potentially good evidence or what if we could use that as an
argument so i ask for people to remain open minded everyone who watches this show i hope
understands that i don't conclude everything that you may believe or think about the matters here
i don't even know some of these things um but that you're not coming at this as a basher either
like you love this stuff you wouldn't have all those books behind you right now and i can guarantee
you those are all topic related to what we're discussing oh yeah every all of these are see
you love this stuff chris and i wish we could all get along better and try to find a way to
i don't know make this like you said a more serious discussion and allow this conversation
to progress if that makes sense with more people not being dogmatic on either side i bumped into
for example are good for an ean mills okay ean mills shocked the crap out of me when i was interviewing
him i said tell me about the apocalyptic jesus and he started to tell me when the video was done i was
like how are you a christian right like in my head i'm like how are you he goes it's my faith
it's subjective and i'm like okay i have respect for that i just didn't understand how because
all i knew of christianity even from roman catholic to the other orthodox positions to
me as a protestant when i was is that it's like fundamental like there's certain things you cannot
allow jesus could not have been an apocalyptic apocalyptic preacher who failed that can't be
the case but he accepts some of these things that scholars are saying yet he doesn't allow his faith
to interfere with his scholarly research and i respect that that takes a lot of guts that takes
a lot of honesty and he has it so i'm with you on those respects with that being said chris i'd
like to see you come back if you would um evaluate your friendship man and your your knowledge dude is
we got to do a show and i don't necessarily need you to have the answers right i love entertaining
the theories all of this information we just discussed on the mythicist arguments and the
historicist arguments i'd like to have a show where you come on and we talk about the probability
of various historical jesus's if you would and just just talking about him like look man no judgment
i don't care who's watching it doesn't matter i want to know like what you think isn't good and
what you think is and say well he was probably a rebel or no i don't think he was militant and
here's why and like all the various forms of a historical jesus i would be like honored to have
you join me in discussing that because you have so many books in your brain and if we can find a
way to download that to mine i would love to just borrow it but would you be willing to do that with
me man yeah i think so yeah i'd love that and if there's anything else you could think of like
for future shows in light of your research like i said man i i um i really do value this and it's
been a heck of a what three hours two and a half hours yep there's a lot here and i'm sure you
skipped a lot of stuff along the way yeah you couldn't there's no way to exhaustively do this
without having a series of 12 14 hours even if i want like i i'm going to be real even my book
won't be completely exhausted if i was to write the most exhaustive history i could have mythicism
it would just be books upon books wide i couldn't extrapolate upon every theory upon it how it should
every theory evolved about on every single thing in one book um but uh but uh since it is up again
i will have a book out in the next year specifically all over on the history of mythicism um there's
there's a whole chat there's a chat there are chapters on it on the dutch radicals on the
soviet union on china on mythicism in china on the united kingdom on france on uh united states um
and and more so it it and then on top of that it's split into three it's going to be split in
three sections um the second section isn't going to go into um common arguments and the current
like historic the current um trends in academia is in general in regards to them so
right different archetypal arguments different um like argument from silence and stuff like that
and then also um going into ideological trends because i'm hoping that this could my book could
also serve as a basis for any sociological studies dude this is awesome i love this christopher
thank you for joining me on mythish and podcast giving us a history of mythicism and i think
this is just my opinion i know that the common section will tell their opinion i think you did
a really good job of trying not to be as biased as possible i know that you've had encounters in
the past where you and dr carrier aren't on the greatest of terms i know that uh some of these
guys you may not be like best friends with or you may have differing views from them but um you
came across quite respectful i felt and uh you weren't too uh biased in any in any way in my
opinion i you could tell your hysteresis but uh man i you can learn from everyone and so
i thank you for joining me here and uh is there anything you'd like to say before we go uh no
i'm all good well make sure everybody doesn't forget if you have already forgotten how could you
we are myth vision
you
