Robert W. Sullivan IV is a freemason,
philosopher, historian, antiquarian, jurist,
laethiologian, writer, mystic, radio-TV personality,
best-selling author, CEO, and lawyer.
He attended Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania
becoming a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity,
earning his Bachelor of Arts in History in 1995.
Mr. Sullivan spent his entire junior year of college abroad
at St. Catherine's College of Oxford University in England
studying European history and philosophy.
Upon returning to the United States in June of 1993,
he took a year off from Gettysburg College
to serve as Office Director of Washington International Studies Council
located on Catherine Hill.
That's right, folks, we have a Washington insider with us today.
He attended Weidner University School of Law Delaware campus
where he received his Jurist Doctorate,
and Mr. Sullivan has been admitted to the State Bar of Maryland
as well as that of the District of Columbia.
He is, of course, a freemason,
having joined the amicable St. John's Lodge No. 25 of Baltimore, Maryland.
For 20 years, he's been a 32nd degree Scottish Wright Mason.
His book, The Royal Arch of Enoch,
The Impact of Masonic Ritual, Philosophy, and Symbolism
was released in 2012 and republished in 2016.
It's the product of 20 years of research.
In 2014, Mr. Sullivan published a second book, Cinema Symbolism,
a guide to esoteric imagery in popular movies
which was republished in 2017.
We'll get a lot into that today.
And his third book, which was also released that year,
is called Cinema Symbolism II,
more esoteric imagery from popular movies.
That same year in December,
he published his first work of fiction, A Packed with the Devil.
Mr. Sullivan is currently working on five books at once.
Count them.
I'm running out of fingers to count his projects,
including one called Free Masonry and the Path to Babylon,
Cinema Symbolism III,
and a sequel and prequel to A Packed with the Devil.
Check out his website.
Robert W. Sullivan, The4th.com,
The4th is spelled in Roman numerals IV,
and you'll find there his blog, news, updates, events,
media appearances, tantalizing excerpts from his book,
glowing reviews and much more.
You can order his books through that site.
Robert, it's great to have you on Myth Mission Podcast.
Well, thank you, Luther.
Thank you and Derek for having me on.
It's my pleasure to be here,
and I must say that I think that was probably
one of the best introductions I've ever received.
I have to be honest with you.
When people read that,
there is always a word that doesn't come out right
or something is mispronounced,
and I think you nailed everything.
So my hat's off to you, brother.
That was fantastic.
Well, thank you, Robert.
I didn't want to mess up on the secret things,
you know, given the nature of the show, right?
Oh, yeah, I mean, no, it was a great way to start,
and I don't know why this is.
It's funny that we start off like this because,
and again, it's not a knock on any other shows
I've been on or anything like that,
but I cannot tell you how many times
when people mispronounce the first book
I ever wrote of the Royal Arch of Enoch.
I do not know why this is.
It might be psychological
when people think of the Ark of the Covenant or something,
but people are constantly calling that book
the Royal Arch of Enoch,
and that is a mispronunciation.
And that happens so often.
I cannot tell you.
It's happened more than once.
It's happened on numerous occasions,
and it was so wonderful to hear that introduction
where you just nailed everything.
Everything went right.
So my hat's off to you.
We're going to have a great time
talking about that book
and so much more with you.
You've been really busy
the last couple of years, haven't you?
Oh, yes, sir.
I did the Royal Arch of Enoch book.
That came out, I mean, that's hard to believe.
That's almost five and a half years old now.
That book was republished by me.
That was my first book.
That was republished by me,
let's see, those 16,
so a little over two years ago
at the end of December.
The company that originally put it out,
that originally put out in the first cinema book,
I'm no longer in business with for various reasons.
I'll just leave it at that.
And then as I was reorganizing
and getting those books out,
I was working on two other books,
which was Cinema Symbolism II,
which was the sequel to the first movie book.
That book was released exclusively by me,
Deadwood Publishing is my publishing house.
That came out in August,
let's see, that was April of 17,
so that's been out almost two years.
And then a pact with the devil,
that was something I was also working simultaneously
at the same time when I was writing Cinema Symbolism II.
That came out like you correctly said
in December of 17.
So yeah, I have four books out right now.
They're in the print edition e-book.
You can get them right now.
And right now I'm currently really concentrating
on, you were right on the five books,
but I'm really concentrating on two of them in earnest,
which is Cinema Symbolism III
and this prequel story from a pact with the devil.
Those are the two really that I'm writing in earnest right now.
Wow, well Rob, with everything that you're doing,
you know what people want to talk about now.
What's with this free masonry?
There's Derek smiling in the background there.
Tell us something about the masons in our midst now.
What's the overview of the structure of free masonry?
How is it organized administratively around us
or in the country?
Or however you want to frame that.
Right, right.
So the way it works is, it's a broad question.
I'll try to narrow it.
Essentially the way a person would want to become,
it starts small and I would say gets larger.
The way a person would,
if they wanted to become a mason would be
to join what is called the local blue lodge.
This is the first three degrees of free masonry.
This is the degrees of entered apprentice,
fellow craft and master mason.
Once you have completed those three degrees,
then you can hold yourself out as a free mason.
At that point in time, you can go into,
there are numerous high degree bodies of free masonry.
You can go into the two premier ones in the United States
or what are called the York right and the Scottish right.
Those are completely voluntary.
You do not have to go into them.
You can if you want to,
but no one will twist your arm for one or the other.
Administratively, the way the blue lodge is organized,
it's run by the guy who runs it for the year.
It's run annually.
It changes.
It's called the worshipful master
and he's assisted in running the lodge by two wardens.
Then you have, that's the local blue lodge level.
That's how you become a free mason.
The blue lodges, the local lodges,
like you mentioned during the intro,
amicable St. John's Lodge, which is the one I'm in.
These far under the ages of the Grand Lodge of Maryland.
I'm in Baltimore,
so the lodges in Maryland
are far under the state Grand Lodge of Maryland.
What is particular is each state land,
excuse me, each state Grand Lodge governs itself.
There is no unifying national Grand Lodge in the United States.
Each Grand Lodge is its own separate entity.
For example, I'd be under the state Grand Lodge of Maryland.
The Grand Lodge of Maryland couldn't bark orders
or dig into the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, let's say.
That's really the way, administratively,
the lodge system in the United States is structured
with the local blue lodges
answerable to the state Grand Lodges
who are independent of each other state Grand Lodges.
Then you have the high degree bodies.
Like I said, there's other ones,
but the two biggies are the Scottish right and the York right.
They are recognized by the state Grand Lodges
as legitimate affiliates of masonry.
There are masonic-like organizations out there
that are legal and out of a problem with them,
but they are not free masonic, per se.
They do not attach themselves at any state or local
or high degree Grand Lodge system.
They are masonic-like, but they are not part of free masonry proper.
Interesting.
You guys, I know I had to get conspiratorial
with my little pyramid with the eye.
You'll see me change it throughout the show.
Quick question, I think this is something
any average person, even as such as myself,
I'm no expert in understanding any of this,
so I'm taking notes.
How does an individual progress within the organization,
at least your organization, yourself,
being a 32nd degree Scottish right free mason,
really kind of how do they progress
and what is the purpose of it?
Is it really holding secrets?
I understand the question.
It's a great question and it's one of those questions
where it almost depends on who you talk to.
I am in the camp that it does contain,
the rituals do contain esoteric secrets.
That is the camp I am in.
There are other masons out there who will tell you
these are just harmless allegories
that have no deeper meaning
and that people like myself are seeing things that aren't there.
My research has led me to believe the otherwise.
I believe these rituals and these symbols
are containing these lost esoteric,
what you would want to call mystery school symbols.
Free masonry incorporates so many elements into it.
It's one of the reasons I was attracted to it
and like writing about it and like talking about it.
When you are dealing with free masonry,
even in the blue lodge and the high degrees,
you are dealing with elements of Christianity,
Islam, Judaism, the occult, Kabbalah, mysticism,
the mystery schools, Gnosticism, alchemy.
This all gets blended into this comparative religion.
This all gets mixed into masonic symbolism
and the rituals.
The way it works is,
it's not any state secret,
but if you want to become a mason,
you have to petition a masonic lodge to join.
Usually you have to know someone in the lodge to join,
although there is a way around that
if you do not know anybody and you want to join a masonic lodge.
There is a way around that.
The way I joined was,
I had a mutual friend of my mother and father
who was a free mason and in the summer of 1996,
he wore the masonic ring, the masonic bell pin.
In the summer of 1996, I was out of college
and I was not in law school yet.
So I asked him, I just had to point blank.
I mean, you probably heard the term to be one-ask one.
So I just said, you know, I see you're a free mason.
I come from a line of long Maryland masons.
This is something that's always interested me.
I want to join.
He got me the petition, I filled it out,
I submitted it with the fee.
The masons will set up an investigative committee
to talk to you.
They just pretty much want to make sure, you know,
you're a torso ahead, two arms and two legs,
and not a raven maniac.
They will ask you if you believe in God.
That's one of the requirements.
You can't be an atheist.
You have to believe in a supreme being.
And then if everything checks out,
they will vote on you in the lodge.
They will, you know, you will have a vote.
And you probably have heard the story,
you know, where the black ball,
someone being black ball,
but this is where the term comes from.
You go into a little room
and there's a bowl of white cubes
and a bowl of black cubes.
If you accept the candidate,
you drop the white cube in to the ballot box.
And if you don't want them,
you drop the black cube in.
You're a black ball.
And it only takes one black ball
to reject the candidate.
It's rare that it happens.
Most candidates are accepted.
The reason for rejection
is usually someone in the lodge
knows the person
and perhaps they erode money by this person.
Or somehow they were swindled by this person,
you know, five, six years earlier
and they want to make amends.
You know, they'll just say,
look, if they got pays me back the money,
I'll vote.
But you know, otherwise,
I'm not going to allow them in.
That's usually what causes the black ball.
But anyway, I petitioned, I joined,
I got in no problem.
And then to kind of lead
into the next part of your question,
you go through the rituals.
The way it works
is you go through the first one,
which is entered apprentice.
Once you take that,
you have to perfect the catechism.
It's a series of questions
and predetermined answers
that you have to memorize.
And once you do that,
you stand in front of the lodge
and you perform the catechism.
And then you can do the felicrate degree
and then so on and so on to you,
reach the third degree of master Mason.
It took me about nine months
to go through it.
Some lodges operate differently.
Some are very strict,
some are very liberal.
Some will let you,
when it comes to the catechism,
some will simply allow you
to read it off the paper.
My lodge made me memorize it.
And then once you go through the third degree,
you're a free mason
and you're entitled
to all the benefits of a lodge.
You can come to lodge meetings,
you can participate in lodge activities.
And again, you are then eligible
for the high degree bodies,
assuming you want to join them.
They are voluntary.
I joined the Scottish Rite
because that's where all my family went.
And that's, it's the same thing.
Only the one thing that I would stress
is the big difference
between the Scottish Rite
and regular blue lodge free masonry
is in blue lodge free masonry,
the rituals are participatory.
You put on a costume,
you walk around the lodge,
you're blindfolded,
you participate in the lodge,
in the ritual.
In the Scottish Rite,
it's more akin to watching
a, what's the word I'm looking,
a passion play.
You sit in an amphitheater
and watch actors on stage
put on these morality tales,
essentially, in the Scottish Rite.
There are moments in it
when it becomes participatory,
but for the most part,
you basically are just sitting
in an amphitheater
watching plays being played out
in front of you.
That's the degree structure
of the Scottish Rite.
That's pretty.
Rob.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, Derek.
No, I was saying,
that's really neat.
It's interesting
how this thing works out.
The catechism idea,
it kind of reminds me
of how the Presbyterians,
for example,
have catechisms.
You've got the church.
This same tradition
has ran all the way back.
Right.
It's a predetermined answer
with a predetermined answer.
And you just stand there.
The way the lodges do it is,
they're very lengthy.
And it's a lot to memorize.
So what the lodges usually do,
and this is what my lodge did,
is they will get a class together.
So like for example,
when I was initiated
as an entered apprentice,
it was January of 1997.
So this would have been
22 years ago now.
In fact, January 17th,
it might have been to the night,
actually.
I mean, it was right around this time.
So at any rate,
but then what they'll do is,
they'll get other people,
they'll initiate other people,
and they'll get a class of like
four entered apprentices together.
And then the catechism is divided amongst
the four candidates,
so you don't have as much to memorize.
So for example,
when I went through it,
I had to answer like one out of every four questions.
Instead of answering all 100 questions,
all I had to memorize
was every fourth question.
And some questions only have one word answers.
So that makes it a lot easier
and it expedites it faster.
Rather than having a guy have to memorize
like whatever the questions,
I think it's 50, 60, 70 questions,
they'll break it up,
and you memorize like every fourth question.
So that'll expedite.
Don't wait until we get a class together.
And that's the way I did it.
And then I did the entered apprentice in January,
I did the fellow craft in May,
and then I did the master Mason in September of 1997.
You know, Rob,
you sold me already on the eclectic idea.
The fact that Free Masonry combines
all these mystical traditions,
you know, mystical Islam, Sufism,
Kabbalah, mystical Christianity, presumably.
And that makes it very attractive.
It sounds very much like my ordination ritual
for the Christian ministry that I went through.
But I'm sure there's a whole range of motivations
and satisfactions that people get from joining.
Give us an idea of people's motivations
for becoming Free Masons.
We understand yours personally.
But give us a glimpse into the range of those motivations
and how maybe have they changed over the years.
Yeah, that's a very good question.
Most people's motivation for joining when I went through,
and you know, through like the 70s and 80s,
I joined in the 90s was,
but to continue a family tradition.
That was my motivating factor.
I had grandfathers and great-grandfathers.
It skipped over my father.
He didn't have an interest in it.
But that was my interest in it.
There was, you know, also people wanted,
I wasn't like you pointed out during the intro,
I was a member of fraternity house at Gettysburg College.
And what was interesting was the fraternity house
I was a member of, that was you nailed that,
Lambda Chi Alpha.
I cannot tell you how many people pronounce it,
Lambda Chi Alpha.
You nailed it though, Lambda Chi Alpha.
The ritual for Lambda Chi Alpha
was written by a Free Mason of all things.
So I had a bit of kind of, you know,
heads up to what was coming when I joined Free Masonry.
And I, like I said, as a child, when I was growing up,
I was always interested in the mystical,
you know, cryptozoology, ghosts, the supernatural.
That just ran in my blood.
And people like myself,
I joined to continue on a family tradition.
It could be community involvement.
It could be wanting to be part of something bigger than yourself.
These are, you know, and to be honest,
there's a negative aspect of it.
Some people are talked into it by their families
and they have no interest in it.
That unfortunately can be a motivating factor as well.
I'm of the belief that if you're interested in it
and it's something in your heart, you should pursue it.
But if not, you know, leave it alone, you know.
And people often ask me, like, you know,
well, I'm an atheist, but I'm going to join in anyway.
Well, if you're an atheist, you're not going to have
any genuine interest in it anyway.
So, but those are my motivating factors.
I do believe, and this is where we get into the 2000s
and the advent of the internet, I mean,
I do believe that there is definitely without question,
especially among millennials,
an interest in Freemasonry in the esoteric,
in the mystical side of it.
This is something that I knew was there,
but I really didn't discover it until after I joined it.
It wasn't until after I joined it
that I, you know, was exposed to the works.
I knew a little bit about Albert Pike and read some of his,
but then you get into, like, Albert Mackey,
and then especially like Manly P. Hall.
That's when I really started, you know,
to piece this all together and figure it out.
And I am, like I said earlier,
and in the camp that this does contain,
these rituals and symbols are mystical in nature.
Just to end, with millennials,
there is definitely, and the advent of the internet,
an element of interest in the occult and esoteric.
This has been decidedly absent
prior to the advent of the internet.
Masonry, and there's a reason for that,
is Masonry in the 1820s suffered a massive blow,
and it almost put Freemasonry out of business
in the United States.
It survived, but one of the consequences
of the William Morgan affair was
Masonry had to distance itself from the occult,
the esoteric side of things,
and essentially re-emerged as
just a fraternal organization that helps
widders and orphans.
This was the philosophy that carried Masonry
through the 19th century,
through most of the 20th century,
through the 80s, 70s, 80s,
up until really the internet,
where then people were being exposed
on a much more easier basis
to these Masonic mystical writers,
and there's definitely been
a renewed interest in Freemasonry
because of the esoteric side of things.
I totally agree with that
and would not refute that.
Wow, so if you don't mind,
Rob, we're going to jump over here
to your book for a second,
because your book traces the origins
of a higher ritual in Freemasonry
named Enoch.
Who is Enoch?
What's his importance to Freemasonry?
I want to say this
because I know you want to jump right in that.
Me and Luther have seen strange numbers,
patterns, symbols,
even in a lot of the literature,
but anyway, this is your
run with this
because I'm really interested in learning more about this.
All right, this is the thesis of my main book,
and I'll do my best to condense the answer,
but it's a very lengthy one.
Enoch is a person in the Bible.
He is one of two Biblical figures
never to experience physical death.
It's him in the Prophet Elijah.
He is essentially
transported into heaven
and is exposed to what could be best described
as esoteric wisdom
through a bunch of angels
and fallen angels known as the Watchers.
They have fallen into
ill-repute with the Supreme Being
because they have come down the earth
and made it with human
being, human women
producing this race called the Nephilim.
They are, you know,
and you know the story with them, with the giants
and all that. I'm not going to get into that.
The legend of Enoch,
as it is in the book of Enoch,
and the book of Enoch is left out of the Bible,
it's very controversial,
is he interacts with these fallen angels,
this group called the Watchers
and he learns information from them.
They have taught humans how to read,
write, arithmetic.
Enoch comes back to earth
and catches wind
that the flood of Noah is coming
and because of that,
he decides to trick the Supreme Being
and he takes this wisdom that he learns
and buries it in a subterranean vault
under nine arches.
He inscribes the mathematical wisdom on one pillar
and he describes the seven liberal arts
and sciences on another pillar
and in between the two pillars
he places the name of God
in a tetragrammaton
on a golden delta
and he buries it in the ground.
The whole purpose of this
is to trick the Supreme Being,
trick God
who is trying to eradicate mankind
and eradicate this knowledge, this forbidden wisdom.
Of course, the flood of Noah comes
and the treasure vault survives it.
In Masonic lore
and this is the entire
heart and soul of Freemasonry
is the recovery
of this subterranean treasure vault.
How does this tie into Freemasonry?
I'm going to explain it.
In the Masonic ritual in the Blue Lodge
there is a character
who turns up in the third degree
who is building King Solomon's temple.
His name is Hiram Abith.
He is finishing the first temple of God.
He possesses this name,
this name of God, this tetragrammaton.
He has it.
It is through the pronunciation of this word
that all wisdom is made possible.
As the temple is nearing completion
three fellow-craves want the name of God.
They want this word and they accost him.
He is trying to leave the unfinished temple
and they accost him.
They accost him one at a time.
They say, give us the name, give us the name
and he won't do it. He says, I'll tell you
when the temple is done, I'll give you the name.
They say that's not good enough and they murder him.
They murder Hiram Abith.
He's dead and the word dies with him.
It's what's called the lost word of a master Mason.
The candidate is playing
Hiram Abith and he's killed.
He's ultimately resurrected.
Think a Christ-like figure
and when the candidate is resurrected
he has a substitute name of God
whispered in his ear.
It's not the real name of God.
That's the end of the blue lodge ritual.
The blue lodge masons are forever running around
looking for this lost word of a master Mason.
You move into the high degree rituals
in the Scottish Rite and the York Rite
and you move forward in time
to the Jewish people
being exiled in Babylon
under the a Persian monarch
named Cyrus the Great
and Cyrus decides
to restore the temple in Jerusalem
so he dispatches a Jewish
governor named Zoro Babel
whose name literally means the heart of Babylon
back to the Holy Land
to build the second temple.
This is the temple that Jesus raises
in the New Testament.
This is the temple that Herod's temple.
The second temple becomes Herod's temple.
You go back
to build the second temple
and the remnants of Solomon's temple
are still there on the temple mount.
As they are clearing the rubble of way
they discover a trap door
in the ground.
It sprung and behold
here is the vault of Enoch
that has survived the deluge of Noah.
They go down and there's the tetragrammaton
and there's the lost wisdom.
This is the 13th degree in the Scottish Rite
it's called the Royal Arch of Enoch
it's the 7th degree in the York Rite
and the reason this is important
is the candidate
by discovering this lost name
of God becomes Godlike.
It's a form of cabalistic
ascensio or apotheosis.
He becomes this Godlike
being in the Masonic ritual
that gives him express warrant
to rule over other people.
If you know your US history
all the political leaders in this country
were part of this high degree system
the guy who ran it was a guy named DeWitt Clinton
who was a former governor of New York State
and mayor of New York City.
You had to have gone through this Royal Arch
ritual and received this name of God
this was your express de facto
warrant to rule in the United States
in the early days back in the day
this is how Masonry literally crafted the country.
The ritual is important
because it documents
the recovery of this lost name of God.
There's two things I should point out is
in the Masonic lore
before the masons discover the treasure vault
the vault has been breached by two other people
before the masons get there
they're legendary figures
the first one is a character
who comes out of Hellenistic Egypt
known as Hermes Trismegistus
he is essentially the de facto God of Magic
he goes down into the treasure vault
he sees the name of God
he pronounces it correctly and restores the seven liberal arts and sciences
back to mankind
if you got the symbolic eye
you will see Hermes everywhere around the library
this is why
the other character who goes into the treasure vault
is Pythagoras
the Greek mathematician
who has his Eureka moment
in the vault of Enoch
I have found that the name of God
pronounces it correctly and restores
mathematics back to mankind
the reason this is so
important
and this is the entire thesis of my first book
is this Masonic ritual
what I have been talking about
this is one of the components
of the lost book of Enoch
which was lost to history
to western civilization
from around the second third century
to around 1792 I believe it was
when James Bruce, a Scottish traveler
returned from Ethiopia with three copies
those copies
they weren't even translated into English until 1821
the Masonic ritual that is crafted around
this book of Enoch
was developed
it was part of the high degrees
it comes out of Paris France in the 1740s
1750s
and there was someone out there
who had knowledge of this book of Enoch
to incorporate it in
to this Masonic ritual
this is the entire thesis of my first book
and why this ritual is so critical
is because it's the recovery of this lost word
I hear him a fifth
when you understand it and you understand the importance
within Freemasonry
it is where all the symbolism
that is crafting the government
the architecture of Washington D.C
the sea that is
all this Masonic architecture
this is where a lot of it is coming out of
so Rob, you're saying that
the degrees are not
equal
some degrees within Freemasonry
are more critical than others
yes that is without question
this is a point of confusion
that many people are not aware of
the degree structure
in the Scottish Rite
is out of order
you hear people say all the time
the 33rd degree to 33rd degree
that's important
that's honorary
you have to be invited to that
but the most important degree in the Masonic ritual
is the 13th degree in the Scottish Rite
and it's the 7th in the York Rite
it's the recovery
believe it or not the degrees
a lot of the degrees that come after that
to that ritual you go back in time
the end of the Masonic story
the end of the Grail Quest
the recovery of the Golden Fleece
call it what you will
is the recovery of this lost word of the Master Mason
that's the end of the story
that's the end of the Masonic journey
which is the 13th in the Scottish Rite
I would argue it's the most important
critical ritual of all Freemasonry
outside of maybe the Blue Lives 3rd degree
and it is really
if you understand it and you understand what's going on
in the Blue Blodge and how it relates
you understand so much more of the symbolism
that's coming out of Blue Lives 3rd Masonry
tying into this high degree
literally it was what the United States
was literally forged around
so Rob
this 13th degree inspired you
it drove you
to write the book
but as we understand
the entire story for the book
came to you in a dream
is that right?
no the
the Royal Arch of Enoch was a product of 20 years
the Royal Arch of Enoch was
a
history book I mean it's not fiction
it's a factual book
what happened was the way that book got started
was
I know where you're going with this
I'll get into what you're talking about was
when I wrote the Royal Arch of Enoch
this was a history book
what tipped me off to this was
there was a book out there called
the top of my head it's here in my library
it's a book the Freemasons Guide to the Royal Arch
by B.E. Jones
I was reading that book this was years ago
and B.E. Jones cites a lecture
by A.E. Waite
who is a Freemason and associated with
the Rosicrucians at least Neo-Rosicrucians
a very famous English mystic
and he was giving a lecture
in London and he was talking about
this Royal Arch of Enoch ritual
and he actually said in the lecture he said
well this ritual is a retelling
and this is in this B.E. Jones book
what no one was putting together
what no one was connecting the dots to
was that this book was lost to history
from the second third century to 1821
so it immediately presents an anomaly
well then whoever is crafting this ritual
must have had a copy of the book of Enoch
at the very least a summary to it
so this was my motivation
and my research that lasted for 20 years
in writing the Royal Arch of Enoch
and what we are referring to is
when I got done the Royal Arch of Enoch book
which was originally published in 2012
I immediately moved it to my next book
which was called Cinema Symbolism
dealing with these occult themes and images in movies
that was a continuation of the final chapter
of the Royal Arch of Enoch
where I talked about a lot of the Masonic
what I could call Inaquic
you know solar symbolism in film
it was really a continuation of that chapter
and I was writing that and it was in
so this would have been around April of 2013
I was writing Cinema Symbolism
at that point in time the first one
and out of nowhere
I went to bed one night
this would have been April of 2013 it was
I had this very lucid dream
this very vivid lucid dream
that usually when I fall asleep
I don't have them
but this one seemed the last hours
I had dialogue, I had characters
it was a work of fiction
it was a story that was just presented to me
in my dreams
I remember waking up very early
and I went over to my desk and I always keep a pad of paper
and a pencil nearby
and I just started outlining
this was like 5.30 in the morning 6 o'clock
I just started writing down these characters
these stories
the story that I just envisioned in this dream
and this dream
this dream scape, this dream vision
became my first work of fiction called
A Pact with the Devil
I liked the story, the dream was very lucid
and the characters
the dialogue, the names
I mean, it became my first work of fiction
and the reason why
it was just so unique was
I've been on other shows
and a lot of people have told me
that in writing these books
I somehow tapped into a higher consciousness
of some kind
a higher stream of thought perhaps
and that this book somehow like
like I'm a service like an antenna almost
to receive this information
to receive
this book, this work of fiction
the one thing I can tell you is
when I first started doing this
I never intended to write a work of fiction
never, I wanted to write the Royal Archivine
I like the movie symbolism stuff
but the story was just so interesting to me
and I just really liked it
and I like the characters
I like the story and I like the twists and turns
but I thought okay, let me just start
playing around with this on the side
and it became my first work of fiction
and me personally I happen to love the story
dark, it's very sinister
it's got conspiracy in it, it's very erotic
and it's out right now, it's called
a pack with the devil, you can get it on kindle
or the print form.
That dream of yours was very momentous
do you remember the date of it?
Yes I do, it was actually
I believe the night that I fell asleep
was April 16th 2013
and the reason I've specifically
remembered this is if you go to the book
at the very introduction
of the book is an author's admonition
which I believe is dated
April 17th 2013
I wrote that next morning
so the dream I fell asleep
and I know that specifically
so the dream occurred on the night
of April 16th into the early morning hours
of the 17th of 2013
I have to totally agree with you man
not to get really
I guess you'd say
too spiritual
but I've had some really strange experiences
as well with dreams
and it was like something
was talking to me
No go ahead Darren, get spiritual
I'm going to tell you, I have experienced
some things, I think
each one of us, I know Luther has
I've experienced some things
where things were said to me
and it was almost like whether it was verbal
or subconscious or within my
gut
but they came true
Yeah sure
it was real
and I just can't tell myself
I can't close the gate off
I mean do I personally
I'm going to be honest with you
I personally don't buy into the typical
story of what we understand
a god to be or a higher power
to what people say
the typical understanding of that
I don't buy into
I think a lot of that is
man has anthropomorphized
and put a lot into it
I'm certain that there isn't something going on
and I'm very highly open to it because
I've experienced in fact that same
premonition that takes place within the dream
I've communicated internally
and asked for it to help me overcome addiction
and look I went from death
and shooting up heroin
to today I'm clean and I'm helping
thousands across the world with my recovery
so I'm not trying to plug that in here
no it's wonderful
I quit drinking
I never considered myself an alcoholic
but I was drinking too much
and in September of 13
I stopped cold turkey because it was no longer good for me
so good for you on that
I've been clean and sober now since
September 2013
have no interest in going back to it and never would
but no you are spot on with what you're saying
I've had similar experiences
to what you're talking about
that I can relate to
what's happened and what my experiences are
and I've been asked about this on other shows
about UFOs and ghosts
I've experienced one ghost
and I've experienced one UFO
the one thing that's happened to me
that's very unique is
it's two fold
for whatever reason now
when I look back on memories
and past memories especially older ones
going back like 5, 10 years or older
when I have those memories
the memories are not viewed
for me as
me seeing them I'm watching myself
I don't know if that makes sense
if I go back to college
the memory is me watching myself do something
walk around
go into a party something like that
it's not remembered as me seeing it myself
that's number one
but the one thing that's happened to me in my life
that's been very peculiar
it's only happened a couple of times
and it's always very innocuous
I will be
it's completely innocuous
it's not anything drastic or scary
or life shattering
sitting there watching TV
or a movie or playing a video game
and I'll have a vision in my head that's very lucid
and it'll be something akin to
walking down a shopping center's aisle
or in a supermarket's aisle
while a particular song is playing
and it'll last for like 3 seconds
and that's it 3 or 4 seconds
10 years later
that image it'll happen
and I'll say to myself
I remember this
I remember
I was picturing this 10 years ago
and here it is happening
and that's happened more than once to me
and it's never anything serious
it's never like a car accident
or something earth shattering
it'll be something like
I'll be outside mowing along with a song playing
or in a supermarket with a song playing
or
looking at something on the shelf
it's always something completely innocuous
but there it is
I've visioned this 10 years ago
that is without question
happened to me and I can't explain it
I totally agree with you
I think Luther does too
did you want to comment before I ask any questions Luther?
I sure can't identify with that Derek
I think the
the forms
and structures of
masonry can give fullness
to some of these spiritual experiences
because if you don't have a framework
you don't want to share
you just don't want to tell anybody
and it just remains interior
and it's not of any use to anybody
but just like the three of us right now
we feel comfortable
invoicing some of these deep experiences that we've had
I've talked with
many Christians
who can't find that kind of a framework
and orthodox Christianity
but in the esoteric traditions
that gives them the expression that they're looking for
I was
a Methodist growing up
and at one time a Methodist pastor
and
you have a lot of free Masons
in the Methodist tradition
those Masons
are not
Scottish right for the most part
they are African American and they are Prince All Masons
I'm not quite sure what the difference is
right there
maybe you can enlighten us somewhat
but I became aware
that there were many free Masons
in the congregation
and sometimes they would wear
pins
identifying them
as Masons
and as pastor
I preferred that they not do that
during service because
I wanted everybody to focus
on the transcendency
of God
consciousness or what it is we were doing
but I didn't have anything against it
outside of that if we would have church meetings
or something like that
we had Masons in the midst
and it was the strangest thing
I remember one meeting
that was being set up
and one of the church directors
I was working with
set the chairs up in a certain way
I had already laid the chairs out
he was a Mason
and he redid the chairs
Rob what is that about
oh I don't know
that sounds kind of peculiar
you know I don't know
in the lodge
maybe he was setting it up subconsciously
based on a blue lodge scenario
it's certainly odd
the Prince Hall
it's interesting you bring that up
I'm not an expert on Prince Hall
I don't claim to be
Prince Hall is essentially the African American
lodges
it's exclusively African American
the issue
the problem that
that stemmed with
the Prince Hall lodge
was a lot of the grand lodges
in the states refused to recognize them
and when you can see the problem
right off the bat
that this is going to create
is this a racist organization
it was a problem
the Masons
the lodges
that were recognized
wrote it off as
wrote it off as if they weren't doing the rituals correctly
my understanding
is
that essentially
this was going to be very
when you had the advent of the internet age
this could obviously present some very negative
PR for the obvious reason
my understanding is that all the grand lodges
now recognize the Prince Hall lodges
I know that's the way it is in Maryland
but for a while
the Prince Hall lodges were never
they existed but they were never recognized
by some of the grand lodges
my understanding now is that's all changed
that all the grand lodges recognize
all the Prince Hall lodges
do you have
African Americans who are Scottish right?
yes
yes you can
there is no
in a lodge
there should be no racial requirement
to join a lodge
or anything like that
I would be vehemently
all Masons would be vehemently against that
I will say to you
that there are some lodges
that are very arcane
that hold to traditions
for example
the oldest lodge in Baltimore
was the Jewish lodge
if you were Jewish
this is the lodge you went to
it was just the way it was
it wasn't exclusionary per se
but that was just the way it was
they changed all that
when Masons started to decline
people of different
I'm kind of non-denominational theist
so I walked in but
with the advent of the internet
and things like that
this is all changed now
where people of
different ethnicities are admitted
the standard is do you believe in a supreme being
the ethnicity
none of that should matter
it should never matter to join a Masons lodge
as long as you believe in a supreme being
and literally on a stark raving maniac
a lot of the Prince Hall guys
depending on the jurisdiction
and this also
you could see where this was causing a problem
was the Prince Hall lodges
would not be recognized by
per se the Grand Lodge
but the Scottish Rite would recognize them
so the Prince Hall guys
could go into the Scottish Rite buildings
but they weren't being recognized
by the Grand Lodge
so this doesn't make any sense whatsoever
so it was really this
probably in the late 90's
early 2000's
there was this movement
where the Grand Lodges
recognized the Prince Hall lodges
this is going to cause more problems than it solves
and now all the Prince Hall lodges are recognized
by the Grand Lodges
but if you are
of a different race
if you're Chinese
or whatever
Japanese
no one should be excluding you
because of that
in a lodge system
if that was the case
I would be very disappointed to hear that
but my understanding is that
that just doesn't happen anymore
it shouldn't at any rate
so Rob if you don't mind in that same vein
because we're talking about masons in general here
what is the
it seems that some free masons
aren't happy campers
with your writings
and what's been the most hostile reaction
that you've seen
most free masons like the book
it's funny that you mentioned it
it's a very good question
the part that I thought was going to be
controversial
wasn't and the thing that I didn't think
controversial caused the problem
my
understanding when I wrote the book
I mean the book is controversial
I don't back off of that
it may not be for everybody
I own that
most of the masons
most of them who have read it like it
there was actually
I won't name him
but this was years ago
I was actually on a radio show
hosted by a free mason
who just snapped on me
and he just started calling me demonic
and evil
and he kind of lost all control
and I eventually got hung up upon
and he invited, I mean it was just a total debacle
the controversial element
well there's a comparative religion study
in the book which I thought was controversial
but that didn't really
wasn't really the problem
the problem was that
it's the whole idea that
the wisdom that is being preserved
by Enoch is stemming from demons
essentially from fallen angels
so in a way
the free masons are the preservers
of this lost
forbidden wisdom
that is coming from demons
that's where there is some
problems with this
and this is where the hostility comes in
that I've met is
this was the controversial aspect
that I didn't anticipate
because
it deals with
and it comes right out of the book of Enoch
is the whole idea of
God how can I say this
so I'm trying to come
to the controversial is
it's the whole notion of divine evil
that probably doesn't make a lot of sense
it's a doctrine that's embodied
in a theory called universalism
and a lot of the Scottish right
and a lot of the masons were universalists
in the early days
and what universalism is
is this notion that in the very end
in the very end of days
even Satan and all the demons in hell
get admitted into heaven
in the end of days God even forgives them
and lets Satan out
and basically forgives all the demons
and lets them into heaven
and it is forgiven
the idea is in the book of Enoch
and I say this and this is where you have the clash
with the Old Testament and the book of Enoch
is in the Old Testament
the evil is definitely considered evil
this is what God is trying to eradicate
with the flood of Noah
in the book of Enoch even though the wisdom
is coming from this fallen angel coterie
the wisdom is considered divine
it's even considered godly
even though it's coming from this
race of fallen angels
so this is the controversial element
that I've run into
you know like I said
most masons I mean I'd say 98%
of them don't have a problem with it
and you know I've lectured in masonic halls
about you know on the book of Enoch
and on the royal arch of Enoch
so most of them that I've met
don't have a problem with it
but I have encountered a few that this
doesn't go over with too well
but I mean it's right there in the masonic literature
I mean you read TS Web's
monitor illustrations of free masons
I mean he talks about Enoch
concealing this wisdom
and bearing it to trick
the god of the Old Testament
and preserving it
and Pythagoras and Hermes
and that this wisdom is restored
in this lost
excuse me this lost wisdom is restored
in this 13th degree
so you know I guess
you know I mean this was part of the crux
of anti-masonry back in the day
I mentioned earlier about the William Morgan affair
this was part of it
you know is that the masons were part of this sort of
black cabal
you know preserving this you know forbidden wisdom
of some kind
so you know this is definitely a
controversial element
and if you're interested and like I said
not trying to do a shameless plug here but
it's really the thesis of my book
so if you're interested in what I'm talking about
by all means check out the book
please dude
well it is controversial Rob but it's also
noble the thought about
ultimate reconciliation even with
the devil and his angels right
oh of course
one of the
one of the
the high degree the
what I talk about universalism
the high degrees of freemasonry
I have to stress this I should stress this
we were talking about the high degree system
of freemasonry this is not blue lodge
freemasonry per se we're really talking
about the higher degrees here
I should stress that
the high degrees and you're going to
get into a lot of deep history here
it's very it's very controversial
history
but you know it's really a long
talking point I'll do my best to try to condense this
blue lodge freemasonry comes out of
England okay it comes out of England in
1770 this is when blue lodge freemasonry
the first three degrees come on to
the history pages
I totally agree with you I know what people
are saying out there oh it may existed in some
former fashion before that I don't disagree
with you I agree there were masonic lodges
there were these operative masonic guilds
Scotland the continent of Europe building
these gothic cathedrals I do not dispute
that masonry is organized in 1717
and it comes out of England
London specifically
the high degrees are different
they come out of Paris France
and
you got to really know your masonic
history here
four years after masonry is created
a man named a presbyterian minister named
James Anderson writes the constitutions
of freemasons
this is the bylaws of freemasonry
but in it he gives this legendary history
of masonry dating masonry all the way
back to the tower of Babel
these biblical stone builders I mean
Adam the fig leaf in the garden is a masonic
apron and god taught Adam freemasonry
was the first thing he did
no mason takes this literally
it's a legendary history
this is what is part of
the masonic lore
then it's handed down
this masonic lore
these building techniques build the pyramids
they build the gothic cathedrals
in 1737
a Frenchman
an Englishman living in France
by the name of the Chevalier Ramsey
he comes along
and this is where we have a problem
where he comes out
and he says
Anderson I don't disagree with you about the mason
mason's building the cathedrals
and I don't really even
get into you with the
you know the biblical stuff
he said but masonry is Roman Catholic
he said freemasonry is the
pure Roman Catholic religion
he said and here's why I know this
it's called the oration of Ramsey
it's issued in 1737
he said freemasonry comes
from this medieval warrior monk
class that ran around
the middle ages called the night's
Templar he said and the Templars are the
inventors of freemasonry
and the masonry is the pure Roman
Catholic religion
and the masonry comes from these ancient
mystery schools from
the Middle East Sufism
the cult of Mithras
Pythagoras the mysteries of the Lucius
the Osirian mysteries
the Templars brought this lost
mystery school remnants back to Europe
they were exoterically
Catholic but they embedded
all this comparative religion
and this is where freemasonry comes from
this oration
this is where you have to
split within freemasonry this is where the whole
night's Templar element comes
into freemasonry and
he writes this oration it's called Ramsey's
oration of 1737
and this oration
births a high degree system
what is known as the right of perfection
where does this come from
this is being crafted by the Jesuits
in the college of Claremont
and the reason they're doing this
is part of what's called the counter-reformation
everyone knows of the reformation of Martin Luther
the Jesuits were charged with
the counter-reformation
what is the sole purpose of the counter-reformation
its sole motivation was one thing
destroy England
and destroy the church of England
specifically
they never forgot the Henry
can settlement where Henry the 8th
tossed out the Jesuits
tossed out the Catholic church
created the church of England
enshrined himself as pope
which existed this day where the English monarch
is head of the English church
the Catholic church and the Jesuits
never forgot this and they created
the high degrees of freemasonry
as a counter-reformation
sub-refuse rues
to undermine England
and to restore the stored Catholics back to the throne
when you understand that
and you understand that interplay
and the difference is where you get into this Roman Catholic
Jesuit night-templar element
coming into it which goes completely
contrary to the blue lodge philosophy
this is when you will start making sense
of this split the history
the codification of the Scottish right
the York right
what the whole thing was doing was
the whole motivation of this is
continuing these rituals and saying
you think you have the secrets in the blue lodge
we've got the secrets
we've got the name of God
and this is the entire crux of the Royal Arch of Enoch
whoever is crafting this ritual
knew something
had access to a book of Enoch
and what you will come to understand
and I've talked about this in other podcasts
is that this ritual is conveying
some sort of lost history
look at the ritual
the discovery of treasure on the Temple Mount
in Jerusalem
this must have happened
this must have been some sort of lost history
that the Templars discovered something over there
and smuggled it back
and it's being mirrored in this Masonic ritual
that is actually trying to convey
lost yet legitimate history
I am absolutely 100% convinced of that
and that is why
this ritual in particular is so critical
because it is probably documenting
some sort of lost yet
Masonic lost Templar history
that actually happened
so let me grab a thread of that
Rob
the Jesuits
who were vehemently opposed
to these original
Reformation impulses
did that follow
Reformed theology
even outside of England
I mean Derek has, Derek you can speak to this
because you've identified with the Reformed tradition
I never
I never really identified with it
but I know that you have
so
is that what has happened
that there's been
this tradition
that is opposed to
the Reformation and what came out of it
absolutely it's called the Counter Reformation
it was created, I forget it
it was created by the Roman Catholic Church
it's called the Counter Reformation
I forget the name of the
the Council
that met
it's in my book, it's just escaping me right now
it's in the 1500s
and essentially the Jesuits were put in charge
of destroying the Protestant Church
using subterfuge
and you will find this
throughout history, I mean the Jesuits are behind
the Spanish Armada
where they tried to invade England and atop of Queen Elizabeth
the guy Fox
blowing up a parliament in 1605
with the Protestant James I
that's a Jesuit Counter Reformation
1666
the Jesuits burnt London to the ground in the Great Fire
then you have
but what happened is
and you have to understand English history
in the 1640s
you have this English Civil War
where the English Monarch
who is head of the Catholic
who is head of the English Church
remember the Church of England is a Protestant Church
it's a Protestant, the English Monarch
it's this way to this day
is head of Church and State
the English Monarch
Queen Elizabeth right now is a Pope
she's the head of the Church of England
she is not only the Monarch
but she's head of the Church of England
in the 1640s
the Church of England
Henry I separated it from Rome
it's a Protestant Church, the Church of England
in the 1640s
the Monarch is Charles I
the problem you have is
his wife is Catholic
and what happens is
this causes tremendous stress
among the countryside
where they begin to see
of Roman Catholic influence
invading the Church of England
so much so that there's an English Civil War
the parliamentary forces actually
capture Charles I and cut his head off
it's that bad
the force of Oliver Cromwell
actually rise up, he's a Puritan
he's a Protestant
they capture Charles I
you have a commonwealth
you have a republic in England
essentially what happens is
Cromwell falls
and Charles II is invited back to Rome
he's Protestant, no problem
he never marries
he dies, his brother comes to the throne
who's Catholic
problem
1688 we have the glorious revolution in England
where he is deposed and tossed out
it's called resurrecting the bones of Oliver Cromwell
and they toss out
Charles II
in 1701
they have the settlement act
which forbids a Roman Catholic forever sitting
on the English throne again
and William and Mary after the Storts
after Queen Anne are invited to rule
and this problem finally goes away
and that's kind of the end almost
of the counter reformation at that point
where the Jesuits were trying to
destroy England
the high degrees are
burn it to the ground
and the Jesuits
seize upon this
they seize upon this very popular
Protestant group
coming together
of men and they see this as a threat
so let's resurrect the counter reformation
and they create these high degrees
as a way to try to restore
the old stort pretenders
the Catholic side of the Storts
back to the throne of England
it doesn't work in the end
it eventually fades
because the high degrees become very popular
not so much in London
because of who they associate with
because they associate with the French and the Jesuits
the arch enemies of the English people
but in places like Wales, in Scotland
the high degrees catch on
and then of course in the United States
you have the revolution in 1776
well who's our ally, the French
to defeat England
where are the high degrees coming from, France
so the high degrees in this country become
very popular
so let's press to the listeners
by that point in time the Jesuits are out of the picture
although what they create is like Frankenstein's monster
they're out of it but their monster remains
that makes sense
Luke this is intense
and you have released a lot here Rob
and I mean I can only imagine
there's so much mystery
and if you will shrouded
stuff around
masonry for so many people
whatever lodge you might be part of
we're always thinking conspiratorial
so something that me and Luther have been
famously known for recently
is dealing into
I guess you'd say synchronistic ideas
and stuff and so
you talk about how well the blue lodge
the third degree ritual as a solar
Osirian metaphor
where astro theology
resurrected sun god man
comparative religion with Christianity
can you go a little bit into that
because that's something I'll be honest
what made my eyes open for me
to get out of the orthodox position
and to really say
whoa
I'm really missing the truth here was
seeing all these religions
having similar
truths and that they're borrowing from each other
sure absolutely
it's a study in comparative religion
and it's a study of neoplatonism
which was a philosophy that comes out of the
second third century which was a twining
of paganism and Christianity
it comes
it's called neopaganism
excuse me neoplatonism because
it has to with Plato's Republic
where Plato equated god to the sun
essentially
and what happens in the blue lodge
in this third degree ritual you can compare it to Osiris
I mean you'll clearly see this overlap
with Christianity with this
where here I'm a biff is
is this architect I mean remember Jesus was the carpenter
so we have the builder figure
who's constructing Solomon's temple
who's betrayed
I mean we have these three
fellow craft
who betray him I mean you could look at this as
the Judas Iscariot type figure
in the Osirian mysteries
if you want to equate
here I'm a biff to Osiris the sun god
the dying sun god
which is what here I'm is
this would be the set character
or set or typhon character
if you wanted to put it in Hellenistic terms
so we have
here I'm a biff is this solar god figure
building the temple he's betrayed
he's killed
he's buried
and the identifying marker
for his grave is a sprig of acacia
that is a flower
sacred to the sun god Apollo
so we have a solar allegory there
and then here I'm
excuse me Solomon
obviously it's notice
that here I'm is missing
and Solomon assembles 12 fellow crafts
to go looking for his body go looking for him
or find out what happened to him
this is of course in Christianity
the 12 apostles or the 12 houses
of the zodiac comparatively
who are going looking for their lost solar ruler
they find the
sprig of acacia identifying
identify as this must be where he's buried
and they ultimately
resurrect him
they resurrect him from the grave
and this is where you get into this deep
comparative Egyptian
mystery school take on this
where they try resurrect
and when you go through the blue lodge
part of it is grips handshakes
which I'm sure you're aware of
these are identifying markers
that is how you can identify one mason
from another
they try raising him with the grip of
an an apprentice and it doesn't work
it fails then they try
resurrect him with the grip of the second degree
that fails so they resurrect him
they resurrect him on the third time
three days dead
third time
and they resurrect him on the third time
with what's known as the grip of the lion's paw
the strong grip of the lion's paw
this is what's known as the grip of a master mason
lion's paw leo
ruled by the son solar allegory
when he is resurrected
he has a
he is met upon what is called the five
points of fellowship
that is a body gesture
that is made I won't get into it
you can look it up online
these five points are a pentagram
five points pentagram
if you are familiar with masonry
and it's symbols one of the symbols
of masonry is a pentagram
a pentagram can symbolize many things
if it is two points up and one point down
it is left hand path kabala
the goat of mendes
negative energy
if it is one point up and two points down
it's Pythagorean
it's mystery school
it's white magic no problem
in masonry
it's one point up two points down
and it represents
in masonry you read this in all the masonic literature
it represents the egyptian goddess
isis
it's the symbol for the dog star sirius
isis is
osiris's virgin
consort
this is egyptian mythology
osiris like harem
is betrayed and killed
let me so far
how does isis resurrect osiris
she has
the secret name of god
this is the secret name of the god
amun ray orah
this is sort of the sun god above osiris
she has his secret name
whatever this name was it's lost
we don't know what this is anymore
she has this name
her star
in the stellar pantheon is serious
osiris is Orion
the next to each other
the candidate is raised
on five points forming a pentagram
symbolizing isis
he has the name of god
a substitute name whispered in his ear
that's how he's brought back to life
this is paralleling how osiris
was brought back to life by isis
by having the secret name of amun ray
raw
it's a study in comparative religion
with a decidedly christian twist
to it
we're dealing with the ancient egyptian mysteries
stellar theology
solar theology
dealing with the solar motifs
symbols
so the hyrum of bith
legend
ritual is rotating around
the legend of osiris
the sun god who has killed and resurrected
brought back to life
you ultimately hear
brought back to life on the five points of fellowship
a pentagram symbolizing his virgin
consort isis
who has the secret name
that she used to resurrect him
which is the name of amun ray raw
and she resurrects the candidate
you often hear the term
the widow's son
the son of the widow
the widow is isis
who is widowed upon the death of osiris
that's where that phrase comes from
that is a complete study
in comparative mythology
comparative egyptian religion
the solar symbolism is carried forward
in the high degrees
when you get into
the high degree of the royal arch
this astrological
egyptian solar symbolism
is completely continued
what i'm saying to you is not a stretch
i mean this is
when you get into the royal arch
before you go to the holy of holies
and this subterranean treasure vault
you pass through four veils
what are the four veils feature
it's a soler journey
it's a soler annual journey
that the candidate is going on
when they spring the treasure door
and the treasure trap
and they find the subterranean treasure
it's noon, the sun's overhead
that's how it's illuminated
so immediately you have this immediate nexus form
between the tetragrammaton
the name of god and the sun
it's Plato's republic
it's neoplatonism
it's egyptian solar symbolism
if you're interested
read the royal arch of enoch
i explained it in much more depth
in that book
and again that book was a product of 20 years of experience
excuse me of research and writing
and my own experience in the masonic lodge
so it's a lot of deep
i mean what's fascinating about this is
this is what i've just given you
is only one interpretation
of this
there's other ones
i mean you can look at this as
it's here in a biff building solomon's temple
and he's betrayed
by the fellow craft
and he's resurrected
he's restored
and then you get into the high degrees
with the recovery of the name of god
where the candidate becomes this god-like figure
this apotheosis occurs
remember the blue lodge rituals
this is coming out of england in 1717
many people
have interpreted
what the ritual i just described
is a ritual of a war
when i talked about where here in a biff is charles the first
and he is murdered
betrayed by oliver cromwell
and the parliamentarians
he is killed, he's executed
and then he's ultimately resurrected
when charles the second takes the throne
and then you move to the catholic high degrees
with the recovery and the restoration of the name of god
is the attempts by the Jesuits
to restore the stored pretenders
so you can look at this politically
this ritual is a political allegory
as well
which is also a fascinating study
so it's a lot of deep history
it's a lot of deep symbolism
and i hope i've shed some light on this
but it's something that's just fascinating to me
and again if you like it by all means please check out
the royal archivine
tremendous rob it's intriguing
and i'm going to blend my next two questions
let's see
if you get into these kinds of
depths
in symbolism
i mean really expressions of the profound
values of life
isn't it difficult
to return to a world where you're just a human
being taking out the trash again
i mean is there a disconnect
among masons
where the craft
has you in a
in a different world than the world
that you function every day
that's that's my first question but let me blend it into this
that's a very good question
the practical business of setting up a country
okay the united states
set up according to masonic doctrine
what's the advantage
in setting up a nation
which is a very practical enterprise
according to masonic doctrine
what's the advantage for the country
and what's the advantage for the founders
tell me
how that works
they're both very good questions
what i would say to you on the first question is
i definitely view things differently now
i feel like
almost that the masonic rituals
going through them and then going through the high degrees
i almost feel like for me personally
and i don't know if this will make sense but i'll do my best to explain
to me it was like a gnostic revelation
that i was i was awakening
to a higher godhead
i don't want to say it sounds too mystical
or pagan or anything like that
but what i'm trying to say is
when i went through the rituals
i didn't really i mean it was just a ritual
i was just researching it
and when i started going into the depths of the symbolism of it
that's when i really began to connect the dots
and understand this
i will say this to you
not all masons do it
masonry, albert pike talks about this
basically masons put you on the path you walk
many masons will go through the rituals
and just go back to their perfunctory lives
and not look any further into it
you got to look at the books of albert mackey
i mean you've got to sit there
as i did on a lonely night
and it was worth it
pouring through these boring
dense books
by albert pike, albert mackey
manly peaky halls, the madame blavatsky
and the information's out there
but it's all in different places, it's scattered
and you got to bring it together
for me it was profound
i mean it changed my life, i could still function
and i could still watch supporting events
and stuff like that
but i do watch it with a kind of heightened sense
if that makes sense to you
and this is especially true
there was a side effect to this
that i did not anticipate at all
there was a side effect to this
that i did not see coming and that was
watching film
and artistic expression differently
because i see things
this is where when i watch artistic expressions
movies and tv shows
i see things on a much more subconscious level
and archetypal level
and symbolic level, i could see through these movies
and see what these movie makers are going through
on a much readily easier basis
than i could ever before
and that was sort of a unique side effect to this
the second question
about the founders
it's a great question
why did the founders use freemasonry
as a template to create the country around
well here we go
we have 1776, they're falling out of favor with england
they don't want a
the founders knew what they didn't want
they did not want a monarchy
i mean when george washington had the famous line
what was it, i did not defeat george the third
to become george the first
so they didn't want a monarchy
and they did not want a Vatican style
religious organization
dictating
they did not want a state sanctioned religion
so what fraternity do we all belong to
where there are these egalitarian democratic
values where a man can
hold whatever religion he wants to
freely without
without being persecuted
or more alternatively
being atheist
if you want no religion whatsoever
freemasonry, we all seem to belong to this
we all treat each other as equal brothers
when we go into this
it's governed by three branches
i mean a worshipful master
a senior warden and a junior warden
why not create three
co-equal branches of government based upon that
and again this is another
i'll just diverge for a second
this whole idea of the three branches of government
the separation of power
in the government
coming from the masonic lodge is solar
this has to do with the sun
the three stages of the sun
the sun in the morning in the east
as the rising sun this is where the worshipful master sits
the sun in the south at noon day
at meridian at high point
and then the setting sun in the west
which is where the senior warden sits
so the whole triple division is the triple division
of the movement of the sun in blue lodge freemasonry
and of course this filters into
the government
but of course you also have
the founders there
you know
we belong to this fraternal order
it's egalitarian, it's democratic
it's promotes religious freedom
and it has an operating constitution
we have the constitutions of the freemasons
put out by anderson in 1721
talking about all this
talking about how these power structures work
about the triple division of government
wow maybe we should rely upon that
monarchy
when you join a masonic lodge
the lowest
a surf could sit next to the prince of
the prince of wales
there's no division
there's no segregation
you all sit amongst yourself as equal brothers
as equals
that appeal to them
the idea of
the idea of
no concentrated power
where you have the president, the legislature
and the judiciary
our equal branches of government
so you have the constitution as a masonic document
the founders
this seemed to work for them
they kind of liked it, like i said
it wasn't a monarchy
and there was no Vatican so this is what they turned to
and you will find the fingerprints of masonry
and of course i've talked about this on other shows
not only on the constitution
and the creation of the government
i mean of course the architecture
and the streetscapes and the city planning
this still comes out of masonry as well
the designs, the templates
things like that
this is quite interesting because
my next question i had for you
it delves into astro theology once again
and i almost
i'm begging you to come back
everybody you got to get his book
but this is something i would definitely want to have him on another show on
because i have a gut feeling
you could probably do an entire show
talking about astro theology alone
and
i could
it's a study in comparative religion
i'll again answer your question
but what a lot of the masonic
writers talk about
and myself included is
what seems to have happened here
and i don't know if it was psychological or conscious
there must have been an element of consciousness in this
is that when you have
the crafters of these religions
they are obviously relying on
mystery school templates
this is what manly people
this is what manly peahaw
laments
when he talks about jesus
he kind of says
when he talks about christ
it's a shame that
300 years after christ's death at the council of mycia
the pagans took over his religion
and crafted a solar religion around it
and you have this neoplatonic imagery
going on
so there is this almost
lamentation within masonry
of astro theology
but it's there
it's clearly there
this comparative religion study with this
it's irrefutable
it's fascinating to me
i could definitely talk about it more and more
you can get into it with me now if you want to
i don't have a problem
i want to save some questions
because i think we're going to eat some popcorn
and go to the movies here in just a second
just to touch on a few things
because we could delve deeper into some of these things
and what i was actually going to ask you
is that with luther not long ago
look at me luther eating that popcorn
be careful with that nine dollar popcorn
that you just bought from the movies
what i was going to ask you
because i said to luther i said man
i feel like we're getting closer
the whole goals to seek what the truth really is
in terms of what is really going on
in the biblical text
because it's so controversial
i mean everybody has a take on it
and i started to recognize something
from someone who does sacred geometry
we had him on a show
and we call him
pretty much a sacred geometry decoded
which is actually a youtube channel
and he talks about jesus being
the chief cornerstone
he talks about a lot of masonic symbolism
and mathematics that are pythagorean
and how it all ties together and so forth
so do you think jesus in this
just i figured i'd ask this question
rather than getting too much into the astro theology
because i want to save that for a show in the future
do you think jesus is
a real man in this story
or is he possibly
symbolic and
masonic in nature
that he represents building structures in a craft
rather than an actual individual man
what are your thoughts on him
maybe just go into some detail
all for the heretic stuff so please help me
well that's a very controversial question
it is
jesus is often
it is it's a deep question
i get into this jesus is called the cornerstone
you know in masonry
this is also the keystone
this is the keystone that the builders reject
and the reason the builders reject this
is because it's a
it's a block that's neither square or rectangular
have you ever seen a keystone
so jesus always considered the keystone
that the builders reject
which is again a royal arch symbol
it's a solar symbol you can't have an arch
without a keystone
the
to make a long story short
what does a keystone do
it binds it binds the other blocks to it
you have the box blocks going up on an arch
and then the keystone which has the
kind of diagonal lines on one side
and then the others it unites
the blocks right are you with me
this is why what happened
i'm going to get to your question but this is a
this is a good little symbolic story
what happened during the american revolution
you had 13 colonies being united
as one okay where was the declaration
of independence you know where these
blocks these states were united as one it was
philadelphia where was the constitution
signed philadelphia where did the 13
colonies become one
right it's pennsylvania this is why pennsylvania
is the keystone state because it's
the unification of the
colonies into one
the jesus the jesus story
um
i believe that the jesus
story is it lays is it laid out in the bible
i mean yes there could have been
there could have been a real jesus figure
the story that strikes me is laid out in the bible
is astro theological
um and and in the old testament
as well um
could there have been like a jewish
rabbi rebel running around
the early first century
of course yeah i was i wasn't
there i mean you know i mean is of course
but i mean there are so many
symbolic
things surrounding jesus
i mean in moses and the old testament
um you know and the creators
of the you know a lot of the christian church
fathers really struggled with this
um you know with the comparative religion
side of it i mean even with like the
mastic side of this um
you know it was the god of jesus
the god of the old testament
because the god of the old testament and the god
of jesus had nothing in common um so
there were a lot of christian writers you said well
there's two gods out there you have the god
of moses who is hates people
wants to kill people wants to destroy
people and test them test them any of the god
of jesus who wants to forgive everybody and
love everybody this is two separate
entities that these guys are praying
to here um but
you know and then you have the christian
fathers saying oh no no no this is the same god
this is one god you know and
jesus comes from the same one
um you know you know so you
have that controversy um
but no i mean if you get into
i mean i get into this in the book i mean with the
the the whole idea i mean
if you want to look at it from a comparative religion
you know where you have
um you know you know jesus being
the solar avatar
um the 12 apostles being the 12 houses
the zodiac um
you know you have a whole idea
the procession of the equinoxes with jesus
being the son in the house of pisces which
is coming to an end um i mean of course
you know i mean i mean you know you have
the fish symbolism of pisces all over jesus
i mean you know the fisher of men
things like that i mean what's the symbol
for um
pisces the feet
i mean what's jesus do he just washes people's feet
right um
so um
you know the opposite house of pisces
virgo the virgin pisces virgin
birth right and then you
have the old house of the sun which is
moses aries you know this is
the fire worship you know where
the the burning pillar
you know the burning bush is where moses
gets the uh name of god you know
talks to god through aries is a fire sign
uh you have moses with the rams horns
you know denoting aries
so you can look at the bible
as you know you know
a measuring stick of the movement of the sun
based on the procession of the equinox with the
old testament the story of moses is the son in the
house of aries the ram and then the jesus
story is the son in the house of pisces
you know what what what
a lot of masonic
thinkers have argued is and this is the manly p hall
take is the manly p hall take
when it is jesus was real but his story
was corrupted at the council of mycia
where the pagans
basically crafted a solar religion
around this guy that's the manly
p hall kind of albert pike take on it
you know
that's kind of like a cop out almost
but you know
you would it's irrefutable to me
that you know there are clearly these solar
allegories these astro theological allegories
going on with the jesus
story with the moses story
i mean you know
the whole idea i mean again of
the death and resurrection
you know i mean the whole
thing i mean the christian holiday i mean christmas
is the winter solstice which is the
birthday of the sun the resurrection
of the sun is when this three month stone
of winter is all away and with the vernal equinox
i mean the whole celebration the jewish
celebration a lot of people
are aware of this the jewish
celebration of Passover and the easter
celebration of christianity is actually
demarcated by the moon and the sun
i believe
that the
Passover
begins
after the vernal equinox regarding
the first full moon and
the easter is the first
sunday after the first full moon
it's something like that i'd have to go up so i mean these are
set by the sun and the moon i mean
that's irrefutable so i mean if you
don't think there's a lunar solar
importance to this you're kidding yourself
i mean that's irrefutable what i just
said so
yeah i mean i get
i mean what interests me with this
was these these christian jewish
motifs that are revolving
around the sun and the moon and astrology
and astronomy and how this is
being continued on
in masonry almost like as a
preserver of these mystery school
thoughts or traditions
if that makes sense to you
so i mean i
am fascinated by the
theological take on this
and it's something that
very much interests me
and like i said i think that when you are
looking at this from a free thinking
standpoint i do believe it is really
hard to deny the solar
astrological motifs in judeism
and christianity
i mean that's my take
rob this takes us really to the door
of these movies
that i'm sure everybody's excited about you
commenting on and showing us some symbolism
but at this point
i'm listening to your command
of the symbols
and the questions are asking themselves
so i have to
i have to make a kind of
a comment
what do you think
well i'll put it to you this way
do you have any statistics
on freemasons who still
attend church
our world a case could be
made is more divided
than ever and you know it's not
just the country but i mean people can
pursue their own prerogatives you've got
the internet and unlimited information
you can go in a thousand different
directions are freemasons
still
maintaining a presence in church
are they interested in maintaining a
presence in the orthodox church
has that changed
over the years what's their relationship
to orthodoxy
i'm going to give you a cop out
answer to that one
but it's the only way i know how to answer it
it's an individual masonic question
i cannot speak for any other freemasons
you just have to ask them
i know of no statistics nor does masonry
keep i don't believe any sort of
stat on
masons and their church going activities
the only way i can really answer that question
is in order to join freemasonry
you have to believe in a supreme being
whatever that supreme being is left to you
you can call
it can be jesus christ
it can be yawe
that is left to you
no it is not
the business of another mason
to dictate another man's religion
in masonry it is
your pay at the god is your own
so if a mason
wants to go to church or doesn't want
to go to church that would be
an individual prerogative that mason
would have to decide for himself
i know pretty well i can state
for a fact that masonry would not
keep any sort of statistics like that
and you would just if
you are interested i mean i can only speak for
myself i want to never presume
to say well these guys don't go
or this guy doesn't go you would just have to
question the individual mason
on that but i can kind of say that within
masonry
it is one of those things where
you know when you enter a masonic lodge
there is the sort of like
leave your politics and religion at the door almost
you know no one kind of
you know wants to really get into that
it is a little disingenuous i mean
to be honest with you where especially more from
a political standpoint i mean masonry
you know that
has had political pentacles before
let's be honest about that
but like you know
as a mason i would never
get into what another mason's religious
beliefs are
or do they attend church
i can answer the question for myself
which is no i don't
but i mean i do believe in a god
but i do not attend church
regularly but that's really the only
way i can answer that question
look at rob it's
only fair
i ask one more question
i'm okay
we can keep going because i know
you guys wanted to get into the movie stuff
i mean i have nothing scheduled for
you know after this so i mean i'll keep going
if you want to keep going
i can usually usually a little way
i mean we're into it for about an hour and a half now
usually a little way after two hours
my voice starts to go
well i was gonna i was gonna say i have something
scheduled and that's why i was gonna
i was gonna wrap things up here with this question
and then we have to continue this because
sure look
you've done something different than any of our guests
and you've discussed things at a total
different perception in a different
way same web
i tell luther this is
all attached to itself
in so many ways the teachings
that these people like apart
from freemasonry are coming to these conclusions
in so many ways it's like
and it just makes so much sense to me
i mean to me i'm beginning
to start thinking i need to really investigate
the freemasons traditions
in attach because like you said is this
a continuity
of the real teachings of the biblical text
i told luther i wonder
if jesus
is this symbolic
ritual rather than a
real man and and i said that because
of the three days and three nights and
and and so many other things chief
cornerstone there's so many
aspects being a tecton in greek
we know has to do with master mason or
some type of a builder
okay there's just something going on
does he represent
the masons themselves is he
a symbol of each man
in this tradition so
there's so much question marks but i want
to ask you about the wizard of
us i set my chair back
luther has his popcorn
i figure why not go out with a bang
and let's leave more
of the movies for the next show
and astro theology and stuff
for the next show because our audience is going to love
this show this is going to be awesome get his
book please so
political allegories and
initiation in the mysteries in the wizard of
us rom
right well the wizard of us was
a movie that i took on in the first movie
book it's in my first cinema book called cinema
symbolism and the winners of us
is a very interesting movie because
this is one of those movies that is
multi-layered there's a lot going on
in this and this should not surprise anybody
because the guy who wrote the story
was a man named l frank bomb
and l frank bomb was a disciple of
madame blovatsky he was a member of her
theosophy movement which was
for lack of a better word i'm condensing
here but just for the lack of it
was essentially neo-nosticism
and you have
this multi-layered
story of the wizard of us
and anytime you have moved a movie
that is multi-layered
i like that i mean that's more of a challenge
for me the one i'm writing
cinema symbolism three right now
and the one i just watched
that is just we won't get into it
the one that is there's a couple of them that are really multi-layered
donnie darko boy oh boy
we could do a whole
show on that one
dark city is another one
and believe it or not the lego movie
the very first one boy oh boy a lot
strange things going on in that one as well
wizard of us
three ways to look at this movie
one is you can just look at it on the surface
that it's about a girl who gets swept away to a
magical land
goes on a venture kills an evil witch
returns home
and the story have a nice day
that's what you would call your profane explanation
this would be your explanation
what albert pike would call the explanation
for the vile multitude
or for the profane masses
this is just your base story
but then we look deeper
and we'll get to the mystery school religion
that's the one these people know
we'll get to the one more people know first
that essentially the wizard of us
is a retelling of political socio
economic
culture in the united states
from about 1895 to 1900
i believe wizard of us
was published in 1900 maybe 1901
i'd have to look where
you have
you had
in 1896 i believe it was
you had a depression in 1896
where you had
layoffs
closures
the farm being swept away by the
tornado is of course foreclosing on the farm
you have
the president at the time
was william mckinley
what he wanted to do was
he wanted the paperback money
and he wanted to use the gold standard
to do it so the wizard of us
is william mckinley who lives in the green palace
paper money emerald city
and of course the gold standard
the yellow brick road leads to the creation
of paper money which is emerald city
in the novel
the dorthy slippers are silver
this represents something called the free silver movement
which is also akin to the gold standard
this is why silver walks
alongside gold to lead the paper money
the scare crow
the american farmer
the tin man
the american laborer who was laid off
was put in a state of
stasis because of the depression of 1896
he eventually went back to work
because of the oil companies
of people like jp morgan and melso rockerfeller
so to get the laborer moving
you have to oil him up
this is why tin man needs oil to move around
the cowardly lion is political
or the political opponents or enemies of william mckinley
mckinley was a republican
so his democratic challenger was
william shenning bryant
who was the cowardly lion of bark no bite
you can also look at him as eugene debbs
who was a socialist
we have reflections of this now
history seems to be repeating itself
so you can look at the cowardly lion
as a combination of both eugene debbs
and william shenning bryant
william shenning bryant
didn't drink alcohol
which is known as a tea toddler
toto the dog is representing that
dorthy is the average everyday
person
and of course the average everyday
person when mckinley
ran upon his running mate was theodore roosevelt
who represented the every man
dorthy spelled backwards as theodore
so we have the reference to theodore roosevelt
right there
dorthy theodore
and of course
with inflation
with the idea of green money
you have inflation, the wicked witch
green skin, the negative side
of paper money
in the novel
the witch is a cyclops
she lives in the castle
with one eye overlooking the land of Oz
this is the raw material
that became sauron
in lord of the rings
the sigh of sauron up in the tower
pervaying mordor
so that was where tolkin is getting that
from
then you get into
that's essentially the political allegory
i may have missed one or two but that's good enough
the mystery school gnostic
element of this this comes from
bombs involvement with
blavatsky and this is where you have the idea
of initiation into gnosis
where you have the farm girl
this is a kind of alice in wonderland
also by louis carroll you're going to see parallels
with these two stories where you have the girl
going up the ladder of ascension
going up the ladder of mithris
the staircase
of the middle chamber of solemn
in the winding staircase to tornado
to be taken to the magical land to experience gnosis
to receive enlightenment
according to madame blavatsky
you need three things to receive enlightenment
you need intelligence
you need steadfastness
and you need courage
you need a brain a heart and courage
you know the cowardly lion
the tin man the scarecrow
Dorothy walks upon
the golden path of religion
only to find that it leads to a false messiah
this is a common gnostic
theme where the god of the
Abrahamic things is the demiurge
the lesser god
of creation
this is the creator god
this is the wizard of odds
the god who rules and fear
but is just the little silly man behind the curtain
so she walks on the golden path of religion
only to find that it leads to a false messiah
and then you can look at the demiurge
in order to receive gnosis
the demiurge likes to keep
mankind in a steadfastness
and to do that he uses a group of angels
and demons called archons
and you can look at the trials of Dorothy
the defeating the witch
the getting the broom as a test against the archons
which she eventually passes
and at the very end she receives her wisdom
she receives her enlightenment
she reserves her gnostic epiphany
which is there's no place like home
wisdom received
she clicks her heels three times
the magic number and is transported
back to
you know the Kansas
and you will notice and this is intentionally done
and this ties into what Luther was asking me earlier
about researching this
and you know how do you interact in this world
well when you notice when she gets back
she's smarter
the farm hands don't understand her
she doesn't really understand them
they kind of laugh at her but she knows she's smarter than them
she's received her gnosis
she's received her
she's passed her trials, been initiated
I've gone through the ritual of wonderland
or of Oz
and you know you can look at the wizard
the Alice in Wonderland story is the exact same story
only she goes down underground
Dorothy goes to the magical land
so the whole idea
of the Wizard of Oz is this
initiation of Dorothy this young girl
where she goes into this magical land
to receive gnosis
to receive wisdom
to have this self revelation
to receive wisdom which for her
is there's no place like home
on this point gnostic themes
in Hollywood are very prevalent
it is a very common theme
in Hollywood movies
especially some of their blockbusters
and I'll end on this we can save this for next time
gnostic cinema includes
where do you want to start
The Matrix, The Truman Show, Fight Club
Dark City, The Lego Movie, The Nellis Sky
this thread
that I just described runs through all those movies
and
it's a fascinating subject
and the Wizard of Oz is a great movie
a lot going on
I like that because it's multi-layered
and if you're interested in that
that was a movie I dissected in my very first book
Cinema Symbolism so we can wrap up on that
and there it was
Magnificent Rob
you tickle my brain
well thank you
I take that
I want my books when I write them
I want them to provoke discussion
and to be controversial
to a degree
and there's the Royal Arch
book out the two cinema books
and as we went over
I'm working on some more right now
so I'm always trying to provoke
and engage in stimulation
even if it's negative
I can take a negative comment
and like I said
if you're interested in what we were talking about
by all means check out the books
you can get the printer or the kindle
the kindles are obviously or the e-books are a lot cheaper
but it was great and I look forward to continue this conversation
in a future date
I thought you guys were well prepared
and there's a lot of material clearly
and anytime you want to have me back on
you just let me know and I'd love to come back on
I don't want to cannibalize your show of course
but anytime you're ready you just let me know
well let's say to have you back
but we don't want to let you go
we gotta do that first before we have you back
but listen let me do a follow up
on the Wizard of Oz
because again this is so
thought provoking for me
1939 was the movie
we had
Roosevelt administration
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
and the Tennessee Valley Authority
the work progress administration
the country coming out of the great depression
America is going back to work
well that's what was happening
with domestic policy
but you had a myth to go along with that
in the Wizard of Oz
and so is that the one to punch
in a country getting back on its feet
I mean you gotta have the myth
on one hand but then you have the reality
and I'm seeing
how they both work together
in building up a nation
or rebuilding a nation
your point is very well taken
you are definitely onto something
this is something I've noticed as well
that there seems to be this synchronicity
whether it's conscious or unconscious going on
within the reality of popular culture
in the artistic expression
and the reality of the quote-unquote real
no Luther you are definitely onto something
and here's what I can tell you
you are spot on with the Wizard of Oz
but you will find this in other
there are other examples of this
Star Wars
I mean you had the end of essentially the Vietnam war
where people wanted fantasy
if Star Wars comes out in 1967 it's a flop
that movie was timed perfectly
you could not
that movie would not have worked
five years later or five years earlier
five years later you would have been into the 80s
new wave forget about it
five years earlier Vietnam war forget about it
and you are spot on with Wizard of Oz
I first started picking up on this
when I was writing Cinema Symbolism 2
but I started noticing this when I was really
started noticing this when I was writing Cinema Symbolism 3
so when we talk about these Gnostic movies
this awakening to consciousness
these journeys of self-revelation
where the character
comes to know thyself
these journeys of
gnosis means to die
to know thyself
to discover something hidden
these Gnostic movies that Hollywood produced
and this must be psychological
or subconscious
the ones we always wind up talking about
like I said The Matrix, The Truman Show
Dark City, Vanilla Sky
Donnie Darko
they all came out in this five year window
between about 1998
and 2002
where you had the change over the millennium
the end of the old, the start of the new
you know almost
I know this is going to be controversial
but you have the destruction of the old
the 9-11 motif
the death to the old, the wiping away
the moving forward into this new age
and at that exact time you had all these
Gnostic movies coming out
The Matrix is like 98
Fight Club is 98
Dark City I think was 97
it was all this
lead up to 2000-2001
Vanilla Sky was 2001
Donnie Darko was 2001
which involved the plane crash
it was all these Gnostic films
were being condensed
right at the turn of the last millennium
I can't believe that's a coincidence
I cannot believe that has to be psychological
archetypal, subconscious
conscious
and it definitely is this idea of
the art
being mingled with what's going on in reality
I totally agree with that
I couldn't agree with you
more
in fact
all these things
are becoming more and more evident
the more I'm researching
but also it's just been experiential
it's something I've experienced
and know to be true
now this show
it's almost like every show
we do just gets better
it's just getting better and better
