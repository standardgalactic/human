In the ancient corridors of faith and myth, miracles served as the heartbeat of the divine,
from the mystical realms predating Christianity. Stories of gods and heroes performing miraculous
healings were etched into stone. These miraculous claims were not a unique feature of Judaism
and emerging Christianity. Our exploration begins in the vivid world of pre-Christian deities and
demigods. Here we'll uncover how seriously these cultures held their divine figures and their
miraculous acts. This isn't just a journey through ancient myths, it's an expedition to the core of
religious fervor and human inclination towards the miraculous. Yet there's a striking imbalance
in how these tales are received today. Many Christians firmly believe in the historical
truth of their own miraculous narratives, while often dismissing similar claims from Greek and
Roman sources. This documentary seeks to challenge that perspective, erging affair, and equal treatment
of all ancient miracle stories. We are diving into the primary sources of these miraculous
claims, bringing them to light for you to discover what they truly reveal. Christianity didn't emerge
in a vacuum, it was born in a vibrant world where miracles were the mark of divinity.
If your hero didn't perform miracles, he was a nobody. Understanding this context is crucial.
Taking MythVision's perspective, people would create stories about your hero or god performing
miraculous feats as better than the competition. No wonder Jesus checks off all the boxes in the
gospels. In this documentary, we'll navigate through the seas of ancient beliefs where every
culture claimed a monopoly on truth. We will examine these superstitious claims, not to disprove
them, but to understand their place in the fabric of human history. At the very least,
those who are often called fundamentalists that presume these miracles are counted in the New
Testament actually happen it. Need to seriosly account for the countless, miraculous claims
from the much more popular gods and heroes of the world at the time of the first century.

the light and history reveals its deepest secrets. Miracles are stories that serve a purpose.
In the bustling, intellectual world of ancient Greece and Rome, stories of divine wonders
were as common as olives at a market. These tales, though not formally recognized or studied,
in academic circles like their more esteemed cousins, the pithy sayings of the wise,
were shared and cherished by everyone from the humble farmer to the lofty senator.
Unlike the revered wisdom anecdotes, which had their own guidebook thanks to Theon's teaching
manual, no such instruction manual existed for the miracle story, a narrative where the
extraordinary intervened in the ordinary, often through the actions of gods or heroes.
However, it wasn't until the early 20th century that scholars led by the likes of Martin de
Bilius and Rudolf Buchmann began to seriosly dig into these narratives as a distinct category within
the vast literary landscape of the time. They were particularly interested in the miracle tales
surrounding a certain carpenter from Nazareth. De Bilius and Buchmann noticed a common thread
in these stories, a three-part structure involving a problem, a miraculous solution,
and then a reaction to this supernatural intervention. What makes these miracle stories
stand out, apart from their divine flair, is their singular focus. Much like the witty one-liners of
ancient sages, these tales aren't concerned with painting a detailed picture of the characters
or setting. Instead, they zoom in on the miraculous moment itself. Yet De Bilius and
Buchmann had to concede that, unlike the short and sharp sayings, these were full-blown narratives
with the potential to offer much more than just a punchline. In essence,
ancient authors had the freedom to craft these stories as they wished, without the constraints
of a formal structure or style. This freedom makes each story unique and perhaps more compelling.
Every story is like a puzzle, holding within its words the keys to its own deeper meaning.
This is especially true for stories of miracles, where understanding the author's intent
is like embarking on a scholarly treasure hunt, to truly grasp what the author meant. We must
immerse ourselves in the world they inhabited, understanding the symbols and references that
were second nature to their original audience. Just as a detective looks for patterns and
connections, we must place these miracle narratives alongside similar stories and
discussions from the same era to gauge their impact and significance. Since the ground-breaking
work of Rudolf Boltmann, scholars have delved into the depths of these stories,
uncovering layers of meaning and context. Gerd Thiesen's meticulous analysis
in the miracle stories of the early Christian tradition and Howard Key's comprehensive
discussions in his volumes are just some examples of this rich scholarly tradition. Yet,
despite all this research, there was a gap, a need for an English language source book
that would provide a collection of texts from the Greco-Roman world to further enrich
our understanding of these narratives. Inter's Miracles in Greco-Roman Antiquity,
a source book by Dr. Wendy Cotter, this documentary will be highlighting her work on the clear context
in which Jesus' miracles are to be understood. We will mainly center our attention to sources
from the first to third century CE to help establish what was commonly understood during
the appearance of the New Testament, as well as the well-known Greek and Roman world. My objective
is to present a diverse array of prevalent conceptions surrounding illness and healing,
then with other documentaries, demons and exorcisms, the forces of nature and the mystical
realms of magic as understood in the first century world. When I speak of the ordinary,
I'm referring to the perspectives and beliefs of the common folk, the non-elites,
who formed the vast majority of the population. However, it's important to note that the authors
penning these miracle stories were educated enough to write in Greek, and it's through the subtle
nuances and specific references in their narratives that we can infer their expectations of their
readership. This is equally applicable to the miracles attributed to Jesus. In this exploration,
texts from noted intellectuals like Pliny the Elder and Plutarch are invaluable, not because we
believe the average person in the Greco-Roman world directly engaged with their elite literature,
but rather because these authors often chronicled the prevailing customs, trends, and societal
notions that permeated the empire. Their works provide a window, albeit from an elite into the
broader cultural and intellectual currents of the time, capturing a snapshot of the beliefs and
practices that, while they might mock or critique them, were widespread and influential among the
populace at large, gods and heroes who heal. Meet the healing trio, Hercules, Isclepius,
and Isis. In the ancient Greco-Roman world, gods and heroes were often called upon for
miraculous healings. Among them, a few stood out for their consistent links to health and recovery.
Hercules, known in Greek as Heracles, is celebrated not just for his strength,
but his deep empathy. Though he ascended to godhood, his own mortal struggles kept him attuned
to human suffering. Isis, the cherished Egyptian deity, extended her motherly care far and wide.
Her healing embrace was sought after by people from all walks of life, making her a beacon
of hope and comfort. Above all, shines Isclepius, the divine doctor. Starting as a mortal physician,
his extraordinary abilities elevated him to divine status. He's revered as the ultimate
healer, guiding medical practitioners and offering solace to the sick. His sanctuaries,
inscriptions, and representations across the ancient world underscore his esteemed position.
Interestingly, tales of Hercules, Isis, and Isclepius each include them reviving the dead,
pushing the boundaries of healing into the realm of resurrection. This dramatic act underscores
the profound impact these figures had on ancient concepts of health and recovery.
Greek heroes, now divine, Hercules and Isclepius. Here are some primary sources about Hercules'
healing diseases. Ilius Aristides elevates Hercules from a legendary hero to a divine figure,
transcending human nature. This transformation reflects the ancient Greek belief and the
possibility of mortals becoming deified through extraordinary feats. In Aristides' portrayal,
Hercules symbolizes the ultimate triumph over mortal limitations, embodying the aspiration
to surpass the ordinary and reach a godlike status. This perspective emphasizes the ancient
notion of fluidity between the human and divine, highlighting the power of myths to express deep
human aspirations and desires for transcendence. Ilius Aristides, Hercules, 40, 111.
Athens, which was the oldest Greek city, and as it were, a guide for all men in the matter of
piety toward the gods and in all other serious activities. Further, it also had many other
ties of friendship with Hercules, including the fact that he was the first foreigner to be initiated
while he was among men. And the manifestation of the Athenians, Zeal, was so great and his
position was adjudged as so very much superior that they even changed all the shrines built in
honor of Theseus throughout the Demes and made them shrines in honor of Heracles instead of Theseus,
in the belief that Theseus was the best of their citizens, but that Heracles was beyond human nature.
Ilius Aristides, a prominent figure in the realm of ancient Greek oratory and literature,
offers a fascinating perspective on Hercules, elevating him beyond the bounds of mere mythological
heroism. In his view, Hercules transcends the role of legendary warrior and becomes a divine
healer, an enduring symbol of salvation and cure. Aristides, with his eloquent and sophisticated style,
portrays Hercules not just as a conqueror of monsters and performer of epic labors,
but as a timeless celestial figure endowed with the power to heal all diseases. This portrayal
reflects a deep-seated belief in the ancient world, in the intercession of gods and demigods,
in the affairs of mortals, especially in matters of health and disease. Hercules,
in Aristides' narrative, is venerated not only for his physical strength and heroic deeds, but
also for his ability to bring about healing, offering a beacon of hope to those suffering
from ailments. This aspect of Hercules as a healer underscores the multifaceted nature of mythological
figures in ancient Greek culture, where they were often invoked for protection, guidance,
and healing, demonstrating the enduring power and versatility of these ancient stories
in addressing the fundamental concerns of human existence. Ilias, Aristides, Hercules, 40, 12.
Hercules also raises the dead, Apollodorus, circa first century CE. In the colorful depths of
Greek mythology, as recounted by Apollodorus, a tale of Herculian valor unfolds. It's a narrative
where Hercules, the epitome of strength and heroism in the ancient Greek pantheon, engages in a
formidable confrontation with Hades, the enigmatic ruler of the underworld. This clash is not just
a mere battle of brawn, it represents a deep-seated struggle between life and death, a theme central
to many mythological stories. In this gripping episode, Hercules' mission is profound and
deeply personal. He descends into the shadowy realms of Hades, a place where few dare to tread,
driven by a noble cause, to bring back Alcestus to the world of the living. Alcestus, renowned for
her selfless sacrifice, had chosen to die in place of her husband, had Metis, earning her a
place of honor and the honours of mythology. The encounter between Hercules and Hades is a pivotal
moment, charged with tension and cosmic significance. Hercules, known for his 12 labours and countless
feats, adds another laurel to his legend by wrestling with death itself. In successfully
restoring Alcestus to life, Hercules not only triumphs over the inexorable force of death,
but also reaffirms the values of courage, loyalty, and the power of the gods to intervene in the
affairs of mortals. This narrative, so vividly captured by Apollodorus, continues to resonate
as a symbol of hope, the triumph of life over the darkest of forces. Apollodorus, the library,
1, 9, 154. Now, Pelius had promised to give his daughter, Alcestus, to him who should yoke a lion
and a boar to a car, and Apollo yoked and gave them to Admetus, who brought them to Pelius,
and so obtained Alcestus. But in offering a sacrifice at his marriage, he forgot to sacrifice
to Artemis. Therefore, when he opened the marriage chamber, he found it full of coiled snakes.
Apollo bade him appease the goddess, and obtained as a favour of the fates, that,
when Admetus should be about to die, he might be released from death,
if someone should voluntarily choose to die for him. And when the day of his death came,
neither his father nor his mother would die for him. But Alcestus died in his stead,
but the maiden Artemis sent her up again, or, as some say, Hercules fought with Hades and brought
her up to him. Euripides, 485-406 BCE. Let's shuffle the deck of ancient stories and deal a
fresh hand. Apollodorus, first, has a seasoned guide through the labyrinth of mythology,
setting the stage for Euripides' dramatic crescendo, and the spotlight is Alcestus,
a play where love's undying flame outshines the shadow of death. Picture the scene,
Hercules, the mythic muscle man, strides in, escorting a mysterious veiled woman.
They encounter Admetus, the heartbroken husband, freshly returned from bidding his wife Alcestus,
a tearful farewell. She, the epitome of selfless love, having traded her life for his.
This poignant tableau is but a prelude to a revelation. A miraculous twist,
where the veiled lady's identity and Hercules' heroic deed unfold, in a conversation
dripping with suspense and emotion. It's a classic Euripidian rollercoaster, where the
depths of despair meet the heights of hope through miracle. Hercules brings back from the dead
Admetus' wife, Alcestus. In a master stroke of ancient storytelling, Hercules, the paragon of
mythic strength, reveals his daring feat to Admetus, a bold ambush at the tomb, where he
confronted none other than Hades, the formidable lord of the underworld. Imagine the scene,
Hercules with his legendary brawn and bravery, lying in wait at the final resting place of
Alcestus. Ready to challenge the very keeper of the dead, the moment Hades appears to claim
Alcestus' soul, Hercules springs into action, ensnaring him in a grip as unyielding as fate
itself. This audacious encounter at the threshold of life and death marks a pivotal turn in the story,
a moment where the impossible becomes possible, thanks to the indomitable spirit of a hero who
defies even the gods to write the scales of cosmic justice. Euripides, Alcestus, 438 BC, 1136
through 11,425. Admetus, O scion nobly born of Zeus most high, blessings on thee, the father who
begat thee, keep thee, thou only has restored my fortunes. How didst thou bring her from shades
to light? Hercules, I closed in conflict with the lord of spirits. Admetus, where says thou,
didst thou fight this fight with death? Hercules, from ambush by the tomb, mine hands ensnared him.
In the woven story of Euripides' Alcestus, there lies a threat of ancient ritual and celestial
decree. Alcestus must linger in a state of liminality until the third day to be released from her
consecration to the catholic powers, those enigmatic deities of the underworld. This period of waiting,
steeped in mysticism, and ancient Greek religious practice symbolizes a necessary transition,
a sort of purgatorial interlude where the boundary between life and death blurs. It's a time when
Alcestus, though reclaimed through the clutches of Hades by Hercules' valor, must yet navigate the
shadowy corridors of the afterlife before she can step back into the sunlight, world of the living.
This waiting period is not just a pause in the narrative, it's a sacred interval deeply rooted
in the cultural and spiritual ethos of Euripides' time, reflecting a profound respect for the
rites and rituals that govern the passage between worlds. Euripides' Alcestus, 1143 to 1150.
Admitus, now wherefore speechless standeth thus my wife. Hercules,
tis not vouchsafed thee yet to hear her voice, heir to the powers beneath the earth she be,
unconsecrated, and the third day come, but lead her in, and just man as thou art. Hence a fourth,
admittus, reverence still the guest, farewell, but I must go, and work the work set by the king,
the son of Stenelaus. In the closing act of Euripides' Alcestus, we witness a poignant parting.
Hercules, the heroic liberator, prepares to exit the stage, his monumental task completed,
as he takes his leave, admittus, overwhelmed with gratitude and relief,
vows to offer sacrifices of praise and rejoicing. This scene is rich with the themes of friendship,
heroism, and the ancient Greek ethos of Xenia, or hospitality. Admitus, recognizing the immense
debt he owes to Hercules for bringing his beloved Alcestus back from the brink of death,
seeks to honor his savior in the highest manner known to Greek tradition, through sacrificial
offerings and joyous celebration. This promise of sacrifices symbolizes not just thanks,
but a recognition of the divine-like intervention Hercules has made in his life.
It's a moment that beautifully ties together the human and the divine, the earthly and the
mythical, leaving the audience with a sense of closure and profound respect for the bonds
that bind mortals and heroes alike. Euripides, Alcestus, 1151 through 1158.
Admitus, abide with us, a sharer of our heart. Hercules, hereafter, this, now, must I hasten on.
Admitus, O prosper thou, and come again in peace, exit Hercules. Through all my realm,
I publish to my folk, that for these blessings dances they array, and that atonement fumes
from altars rise. For now, to happier days than those o'er past have we attained, I own me blessed
In Euripides' captivating narrative of Alcestus, the chorus, ever the reflective voice and
emotional barometer of Greek drama, steps forth to marvel at the extraordinary events that have
unfolded. They sing praises of this marvelous thing, a deed so astounding and unexpected
that it eludes the ordinary sight and understanding. This moment in the play is a testament to the
timeless allure of Greek tragedy, where the chorus not only narrates but also deeply contemplates
the unfolding drama. Their words underscore the miraculous nature of Alcestus' return
from the clutches of death, a feat that defies the natural order and the expected paths of mortal
existence. It's as if the chorus is inviting the audience to gaze beyond the veil of reality,
to acknowledge the presence of forces and pathways that lie hidden from mortal eyes.
In their lyrical exaltation, the chorus captures the essence of wonder and mystery that pervades
the play, celebrating the unfathomable and the divine intervention that has turned sorrow into joy
and despair into hope.
Chorus, oh the works of the gods, in manifold forms they reveal them, manifold things
unhoped for the gods to accomplishment bring, and the things that we look for, the gods'
day not to fulfill them, and the paths undissurned of our eyes, the gods unseal them. So fell this
marvelous thing.
This widespread devotion
is indicative of the common human desire for health and well-being and the belief in divine
intervention in matters of illness and healing. In these temples, people sought cures for their
ailments and gave thanks for recoveries, often leaving behind offerings or inscriptions detailing
their experiences of healing. Apolaus' acknowledgement of Asclepius' universal worship
highlights the gods' profound impact on the ancient world, illustrating how deities often
embodied fundamental human concerns and desires, thus gaining a broad and enduring appeal.
Embarking on a scholarly yet whimsical journey through the annals of ancient lore, we encounter
the definitive exploration of Asclepius, the enigmatic killer deity in Emma J. Edelstein
and Ludwig Edelstein's magnum opus, Asclepius. This two-volume masterpiece is akin to a treasure
offering a rich collection of archaic texts and insightful discussions that illuminate the
miracles of Jesus in a whole new light. Asclepius, known to the Romans as Esculapius or Esculapius,
initially graced Homer's epic as a mere mortal destined to accompany the Argonauts.
Yet, as legends often do, his story morphed, elevating him to a quasi-divine stature,
a celestial offspring born from the union of Apollo and his mortal lover,
Caronus, under the tutelage of Chiron, a wise centaur from Thessaly. Asclepius honed his healing
prowess, however, his compassionate act of resurrecting the dead kindled Zeus's wrath,
leading to his untimely demise by a bolt of lightning renowned for his altruistic spirit.
Asclepius was often lauded as the God most loving toward humanity. As the ancient writer
Elian once put it, his sanctuary at Epidaurus emerged as a legendary site for miraculous cures
during the Hellenic era. Here, the devout underwent a ceremonial cleansing and partook
in incubation, a ritual that involved slumbering in the Deity's temple. Amidst their dreams,
they eagerly anticipated divine revelations, hoping that the God through his priestly proxy
would impart the secret to their healing. By the imperial epoch, Asclepius' revered status,
soared to celestial heights, evidenced by his statue's prestigious placement in Apollo's temple.
The seamless blend of healer and savior roles underpinned his widespread veneration,
particularly in matters concerning life's prolongation. An intriguing facet of Asclepius'
mythos, albeit less frequently mentioned, touches upon accusations of greed. Yet this blip in his
legend does little to overshadow his overarching narrative, one that distinctively lacks the Olympian
God's notorious, jealous rages or cunning plots. Asclepius stands as a unique figure in mythology,
celebrated for his unwavering compassion and benevolence toward mankind.
Testimonies from Epidaurus Drawing primarily from an ancient stele,
circa 350 BCE, the accounts of Asclepius' miraculous healings paint a vivid picture
of his divine interventions. Among these, some narratives belong to the later Greco-Roman era,
each meticulously annotated with their estimated date of inscription.
One particularly striking tale is that of Ambrosia, a woman afflicted with blindness
in one eye. Despite her skepticism towards Asclepius' dream-based cures,
she experienced a miraculous healing. As a testament to her transformation
and a nod to her initial disbelief, she was encouraged to dedicate a silver pig to Asclepius,
symbolizing her newfound respect and acknowledgement of his power.
This story, among others, is preserved in the Excriptiones Greca,
a collection of ancient Greek inscriptions that serve as a testament to the enduring legacy
and mystical prowess of Asclepius, the healer god.
Inscriptiones Grecai, 4, 1, 121-122, Stile 1,4
The man with no eye,
but only an eye socket. In the Inscriptiones Grecai collection, which chronicles the wonders of the
ancient world, there lies a remarkable account of faith and miraculous recovery under the
auspices of Asclepius. This narrative centers on a man who, despite having only an eye socket
and facing the scorn of others, placed his unwavering trust in the healing powers of Asclepius,
defying the derision of the people around him. This individual sought refuge in the divine
intervention of Asclepius. In a profound testament to his faith, the god rewarded his belief by
miraculously restoring his eye. Inscriptiones Grecai, 4, 1, 121-122, Stile 1,9
A man came as a supplicant to the god. He was so blind that of one of his eyes he had only
the eyelids left. Within them was nothing, but they were entirely empty. Some of those in the
temple laughed at his silliness to think that he could recover his sight when one of his eyes
had not even a trace of the ball, but only the socket. As he slept, a vision appeared to him.
It seemed to him that the god prepared some drug then, opening his eyelids, poured it into them.
When day came, he departed with the sight of both eyes restored.
Alcetus, the blind man The tale of Alcetus as preserved in the ancient records
is a stirring example of divine intervention and the miraculous capacities attributed to Asclepius.
Alcetus, known for his affliction of blindness, experienced a profound and transformative dream.
In this visionary state, he perceived Asclepius himself approaching him. In the dream, Asclepius,
the revered god of healing, performed a simple yet miraculous act. With a gentle touch,
he opened Cetus's eyes using his fingers. This symbolic gesture, steeped in the mystical
traditions of ancient healing, represented the restoration of sight. Inscription is Greca,
4.1.121-122. Stile 118.
Alcetus of Haleis The blind man saw a dream. It seemed to him that the god came up to him and
with his fingers opened his eyes, and that he first saw the trees in the sanctuary. At daybreak,
he walked out sound. Herman's blindness is healed. The account of Herman, as chronicled in the
inscription as Greca, offers a captivating insight into the ancient beliefs surrounding
gratitude and divine retribution. Herman, who once suffered from blindness, initially experienced
the benevolent healing touch of Asclepius. This miraculous intervention granted him the gift of
sight, a profound change that should have marked the end of his tribulations. However, Herman's tale
takes an intriguing twist. After regaining his sight, he fell to express his gratitude to Asclepius,
an oversight that did not go unnoticed in the divine realm. As a result of this neglect, his
blindness returned, poignant reminder of the god's expectations of reverence and thanksgiving. It was
only upon his realization of the need to give thanks and acknowledge Asclepius' role in his
healing that Herman's sight was restored once again. In Scripcionis, Greca, 4.1. 121-122.
Stilly, 222. Herman of Thacis. His blindness was cured by Asclepius, but since afterwards he did
not bring the thank offerings. The god made him blind again. When he came back and slept again
in the temple, he, the god, made him well. Valerius Aper, a blind soldier. The saga
of Valerius Aper, a blind soldier, as recorded in the inscription as Greca, unveils yet another
facet of Asclepius' legendary healing powers, unlike the miraculous interventions often attributed
to him. In Valerius' case, the god of healing employed a more tangible method, a medical eye
salve. Valerius, whose sight had been taken from him, perhaps through the trials of war or
ailment, sought the aid of Asclepius. In a departure from his usual ethereal approach,
Asclepius prescribed a specific eye salve, a remedy rooted in the medicinal knowledge of the time.
Remarkably, upon using this salve, Valerius' sight was restored. This narrative stands out
as it combines the mystical with the medicinal, showcasing Asclepius not only as a divine figure
capable of supernatural feats, but also as a deity versed in the practical healing arts,
inscription as Greca, 14, 966, 2nd century CE. To Valerius Aper, a blind soldier, the god revealed
that he should go and take the blood of a white cock along with honey and compound an eye salve,
and for three days should apply it to his eyes, and he could see again and went and publicly
offered thanks to the god. Asclepius heals a woman of dropsy errata. The dropsical woman is healed
from a distance. The tale of errata, a woman afflicted with dropsy, as detailed in the inscription
as Greca, reveals a remarkable instance of Asclepius' healing power, notably characterized by its long
distance effect. This story is unique in the way it intertwines the spiritual and physical realms
through the medium of dreams. Errata, residing in Lacedaemon, Sparta, and her mother, who was in
Epidaurus, simultaneously experienced a profound and synchronistic dream. In this shared vision,
both were visited by the image of errata being healed by Asclepius. This simultaneous dream
occurrence, happening in two different locations, underscores the far-reaching influence and
omnipresence of Asclepius as a healer. The narrative highlights the significance of dreams and ancient
healing practices, and the belief in their prophetic and transformative power. The fact
that errata's healing was perceived in a dream by her mother at the famed sanctuary of Asclepius,
and Epidaurus, a central site of healing pilgrimages, further imbues the story with
a sense of divine orchestration, and the interconnectedness of the spiritual and physical
worlds. Inscription as Greca, 4, 1, 121 to 122, Stili, 2, 21. Errata, a woman of Lacedaemon,
dropsy, for her while she remained in Lacedaemon, her mother slept in the temple and sees a dream.
It seemed to her that the god cut off her daughter's head and hung up her body in such a way that her
throat was turned downwards. Out of it came a huge quantity of fluid matter. Then he took down the
body and fitted the head back onto the neck. After she had seen this dream, she went back
to Lacedaemon, where she found her daughter in good health. She had seen the same dream.
Dumbness, Asclepius heals a mute boy. The story of the mute boy's healing, as recorded in the
inscription as Greca, is a striking example of the miraculous deeds attributed to Asclepius.
This particular account stands out for its dramatic and instantaneous nature.
The narrative unfolds with the boy's father seeking Asclepius's aid for his son's muteness.
During this encounter, a servant of Asclepius requested the father to pledge a thank offering
in return for the boy's healing. In a stunning and unexpected turn of events,
it was the mute boy himself who suddenly spoke, exclaiming, I promise, this moment marked the
boy's miraculous recovery from muteness, a feat that no doubt left those present in all.
The story encapsulates the ancient belief in the power of the divine intervention and the
significance of vows and offerings to the gods. It also highlights the immediacy with which Asclepius
was believed to act, responding to faith and promises of gratitude with swift and life-changing
healings. Inscription as Greca, 4, 1, 121 to 122, stilly, 1, 5.
Epilepsy. Asclepius heals a man with epilepsy. The healing of a man with epilepsy by Asclepius
as chronicled by Oribasius in Collectionis Medici presents a fascinating glimpse into the
ancient approaches to healing and the versatility of Asclepius's methods. In this case, the cure is
particularly intriguing as it involves substituting one element for another. Asclepius, renowned for
his wisdom in the medical arts, chose an unconventional path to cure the man's epilepsy.
Instead of directly eliminating the condition, he replaced it with a quarten fever. A type of
malaria characterized by fever episodes recurring approximately every third day. This method of
curing by substitution reflects a sophisticated understanding of illness and treatment strategies
one that goes beyond mere supernatural intervention. Oribasius, Collectionis Medici, 45, 30, 10 through
1,412. Also, epilepsy is a cramp of this quarten fever, therefore, is a cure so that if it supervenes
afterwards, epilepsy is broken up. While if it comes previously, epilepsy does not befall that
man anymore. How it happened to Tusa, the Cisisinian, circa 100 C, is worth telling. When he was
afflicted with epilepsy, he came to Pergamum to Asclepius, asking for liberation from the disease.
The God appearing to him holds converse with him and asks if he wants to exchange his present
disease against another one. And he said he surely did not want that, but would rather get some
immediate relief from the evil. But if at all, he wished that the future might not be worse than
the present. When the God had said it would be easier and this would cure him more plainly than
anything else, he, Tusa, consents to the disease and a quarten fever attacks him and thereafter,
he is free from epilepsy.
Nicanor, the lame man. The story of Nicanor, a lame man documented in the inscription as Greca,
offers a captivating and somewhat humorous insight into the methods of healing associated with
Asclepius. This particular account stands out for its unexpected turn of events leading to recovery.
Nicanor, burdened by lameness, experienced a rather unconventional path to healing.
In a surprising twist, a boy mischievously stole Nicanor's crutch. Instinctively, Nicanor found
himself running after the boy to retrieve his crutch. This spontaneous act, driven by necessity,
resulted in Nicanor miraculously regaining his ability to walk properly. This narrative not
only illustrates the miraculous healing powers attributed to Asclepius, but also highlights
the element of spontaneity and the unexpected in the process of recovery. In Scripcionis Greca,
4, 1, 121 to 122, Stile, 116.
Nicanor, a lame man. While he was sitting wide awake, a boy snatched his crutch from him and
ran away. But Nicanor got up, pursued him, and so became well.
The lame man from Epidaurus. In the story from Scripcionis Grecai, a lame man from Epidaurus,
initially too fearful to follow Asclepius' directive to climb the sanctuary at night,
eventually overcomes his fear and lameness by completing the climb during the day.
This act of bravery leads to his miraculous cure, highlighting the ancient belief in the
interplay of divine intervention and personal courage in the healing process. In Scripcionis
Grecai, 4, 1, 121 to 122. Stile, 235.
In the story of Scripcionis Grecai, we encounter a man with a crippled foot who initially scoffed
at the healing powers of Asclepius. However, his perspective drastically changed when he himself
was in need of healing. This account underscores a common theme in ancient narratives,
transformation of skepticism into belief through personal experience of the miraculous.
Sificis' journey from a doubter to a beneficiary of Asclepius' healing illustrates
the power of personal experience in altering beliefs and attitudes. In Scripcionis Grecai,
4, 1, 121 to 122. Stile, 236.
Paralysis. The man with paralyzed fingers is healed. In the Scripcionis Grecai, a man with
paralyzed fingers, initially skeptical of the Asclepius powers, was humorously renamed
incredulous by the deity due to his doubt. Miraculously, by the next morning, he found
himself healed, symbolizing the shift from skepticism to belief through the experience
of divine intervention. In Scripcionis Grecai, 4, 1, 121 to 122. Stile, 13.
He expressed incredulity regarding the cures and scoffed at the inscriptions. But in his sleep,
he saw a vision. It seemed to him that as he was playing a dice below the temple and was about
to cast the dice, the god appeared, sprang upon his hand and stretched out his the patient's fingers.
When the god had stepped aside, it seemed to him, the patient that he, the patient, bent his hand
and stretched out all his fingers one by one. When he had straightened them all, the god asked him
if he would still be incredulous of the inscriptions on the tablets in the temple. He
answered that he would not. Since then, formally, you were incredulous of the cures, though they were
not incredible for the future. He said, your name will be incredulous when the day dawned,
he walked out sound. The man who was paralyzed in his body is healed. In the story from the
inscriptionist Grecai, Hermodocus, a man paralyzed in his body, experienced a remarkable healing.
Asclepius commanded him to bring to the temple the largest stone he could carry.
Despite his paralysis, Hermodocus, complied with this challenging and in doing so,
found himself miraculously healed. This narrative emphasizes the theme of overcoming
physical limitations through faith and effort, highlighting the ancient belief in the power
of divine intervention, combined with human determination. Inscriptionist Grecai, 4.1.21-22,
still.1.15. Hermodocus of Lampsacus was paralyzed in body. This one, when he slept in the temple,
the god healed, and he ordered him upon coming out to bring to the temple as large a stone as he
could. The man brought the stone, which now lies before the avatar. Hermodocus leaves an inscription
to Asclepius' honor. In the ancient text Inscriptionist Grecai, dating back to around the
third century BCE, Hermodocus of Lampsacus leaves a poignant inscription in honor of Asclepius.
His words, This rock is an evidence of your art. Serve as a lasting testament to the miraculous
healing he received. The inscription likely referring to the very stone he was commanded to
carry as part of his healing symbolizes both his gratitude and the tangible proof of Asclepius'
divine intervention. Inscriptionist Grecai, 4.1.1.25, circa third century BCE, Hermodocus of Lampsacus.
As an example of your power, Asclepius, I have put up this rock which I had lifted
up, manifest for all to see, an evidence of your art. For before coming under your hands and those
of your children, I was stricken by a wretched illness, having an abscess in my chest and being
paralyzed in my hands. But you, Pion, by ordering me to lift up this rock, made me live free from
disease. Clemens of Argus, paralyzed in body. Asclepius demands that the cowardly Clemens be
full of hope. Inscriptionist Grecai, 4.1.1.21 to 1.22, stilly, 2.37. Clemenus of Argus,
paralyzed in body. He came to the Abaton and slept there and saw a vision. It seemed to him
that the God wound a red woolen fillet around his body and led him for a bath a short distance
away from the temple to a lake of which the water was exceedingly cold. When he behaved in a cowardly
way, Asclepius said he would not heal those people who were too cowardly for that, but those who came
to him into his temple full of hope that he would do no harm to such a man, but would send him away
well. When he woke up, he took a bath and walked out unhurt.
Diatus, paralyzed in the knees. In the story of Diatus, from the inscriptionist Grecai,
we encounter a unique and symbolic instance of healing. Diatus, paralyzed in the knees,
had a vivid dream in which Asclepius drove his horses over his body. This dream was a pivotal
moment for a Diatus, as it was then that he regained control of his knees. In scriptionist Grecai,
4.1. 121-122. Stilly, 238. Diatus of Cura, he happened to be paralyzed in his knees. While sleeping
in the temple, he saw a dream. It seemed to him that the God ordered his servants to lift him up
and to carry him outside the Additan and to lay him down in front of the temple. After they had
carried him outside, the God yoked his horses to a chariot and drove three times around him in
a circle and trampled on him with his horses, and he got control over his knees instantly. When day
came, he walked out south. Asclepius in Dreams, Artimiderus, late 2nd century CE. Artimiderus'
work in the late 2nd century CE offers a fascinating glimpse into the cultural psyche
of the Greco-Roman Mediterranean world. His collection of dream interpretations, as described,
goes beyond the scholarly circles and draws from a diverse array of sources, including
everyday conversations and beliefs found in marketplaces across the empire.
The true worth of Artimiderus' compilation lies not necessarily in the accuracy of the
interpretations, but rather in its reflection of the prevailing thoughts, values, and associations
of his time. It serves as a window into the common symbolism and meanings attached to
various situations, objects, and people within that historical and cultural context. This
compilation is invaluable for understanding the collective mindset and the cultural realities
of the 2nd century CE, offering insights into how dreams were perceived and interpreted in
everyday life during this era. Asclepius always indicates those who help in time of need.
In Artimiderus' On the Interpretation of Dreams, a work that delves into the symbolism and
meanings of dreams in the ancient world, Asclepius is portrayed as a harbinger of healing and help.
According to this text, dreaming of Asclepius entering the house of a sick person is a sign
of impending recovery. This interpretation underscores the deep reverence and trust placed
in Asclepius as a divine healer. His mere presence in a dream, especially in the context
of visiting the sick, was seen as a powerful omen of positive transformation and healing.
Artimiderus On the Interpretation of Dreams, 2.37
If Asclepius is set up in a temple and stands upon a pedestal, if he is seen and adored,
it means good luck for all. But if he moves and approaches or goes into a house, it prophesies
sickness and famine. But for those already sick, it signifies recovery, for the God is called
pion, the healer. Asclepius always indicates those who help in time of need and those who
manage the house of the dreamer. Asclepius is healing as distinctive in the Greco-Roman period.
Howard Key provides this as an example of the main difference between the Greco-Roman attributions
to Asclepius and those of Hellenic times. The contrasts with the ear martyr of Hellenistic
times are striking. Although the God is given ultimate credit for the cure, the therapy seems
to have been largely self-administered. There is no mention of the sacred sleep or dream visions.
Rather, there are baths and strolls, presumably extending over a period of many days.
The ailments are multiple. To heal them, there is no lick by the tongue of a snake or a dog.
The beneficiary is grateful for the improvement in his health, but there is no miraculous healing
at a stroke. Significant, however, is the clear implication that the course of Appellus' life,
see below, is under the guidance of the God. It is a factor which figures importantly in the
evidence from Pergamum in the same period that Appellus was overcoming his maladies at Epidorus
with the aid of the God. A devotee receives general healing of stomach and throat.
Inscription is Greco, 4-sil, 3-1-1-1-7-0, circa 160 CE.
I, M. Julius Appellus, was sent forth by the God since I fell sick often and was stricken with
indigestion. On the journey to Aegina, not much happened to me. When I arrived at the sanctuary,
it happened that my head was covered for two days, during which there were torrents of rain.
Cheese and bread were brought to me, celery and lettuce. I bathed alone without help,
was forced to run, lemon rinds to take, soaked in water. At the aquae in the bath I rub myself on
the wall, went for a stroll on the high road, swinging, smeared myself with dust, went walking,
barefoot. At the bath, poured wine over myself before entering the hot water, bathed alone and
gave the bath. Master and Attic Drachma made common offering to Asclepius, to Epion, his wife,
to the Ellucinian goddess, took milk with honey. I used the oil and the headache was gone. I gargled
with cold water against a sore throat, since this was another reason that I had turned to the God.
The same remedy for swollen tonsils. I had occasion to write this out, with grateful heart and having
become well, I took leave. According to his legends, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for bringing the
dead back to life. The most popular version explains the punishment in connection with the myth of
Hippolytus. When Hippolytus, Theseus' son, discovered that his stepmother desired him,
he violently upbraided her, after which she committed suicide, leaving a note which falsely
accused Hippolytus of rape. Despite Hippolytus' pleas of his innocence, Theseus believed the
suicide note and exiled Hippolytus. While the young man was driving his chariot by the sea,
a monster came out of the waters and frightened the horses. Hippolytus was thrown from the chariot
and died. Artemis, who loved Hippolytus, moved Asclepius to bring the young man back to life.
This act was sufficient to bring the wrath of Zeus against Asclepius, and he sent
lightning to strike and kill the physician. The element that is of importance then, as we see it,
is the availability of the idea of a healer giving up his own life in return for raising the dead
Diodorus Sicilis wrote around 60 to 30 BCE. Asclepius is slain by Zeus at the complaint
from Hades about the diminishing numbers of dead because of the healing gods saving them.
Diodorus Sicilis, the library of history, 4, 71, 1 through 317.
Asclepius was the son of Apollo and Coronis, and since he excelled in natural ability and
sagacity of mind, he devoted himself to the science of healing and made many discoveries which
contribute to the health of man kind. And so far, did he advance along the road of fame that
to the amazement of all, he healed many sick whose lives had been despaired off and for this reason
it was believed that he had brought back to life many who had died. Consequently, the myth goes on
to say Hades brought accusation against Asclepius, charging him before Zeus of acting to the detriment
of his own province, for he said the number of the dead was steadily diminishing, now that men
were being healed by Asclepius. So Zeus, in indignation, slew Asclepius with his thunderbolt,
but Apollo, indignant at the slaying of Asclepius, murdered the Cyclopes who had forged the thunderbolt
for Zeus. But at the death of the Cyclopes, Zeus was again indignant and laid a command upon Apollo
that he should serve as a laborer for a human being and that this should be the punishment
he should receive from him for his crimes. Virgil, 70-19 BCE. The father omnipotent hurled down to
waters the finder of such healing craft, Virgil Aeneid 7, 765 to 77,318.
Apollodorus, circa 1st century CE. Asclepius raised six men, Capaneus, Lycurgus, Hippolytus,
Tindarius, Hymennaeus, and Glaucus. Apollodorus, the library 3, 10, 3-419.
To wit, Capaneus and Lycurgus, as Stessichorus, 645-555 BCE. Says in the Eryphilly, Hippolytus,
as the author of the Nalpactica, 6th country BCE reports. Tindarius, as Paniacis, circa 500 BCE
says. Hymennaeus, as the Orphic's report. And Glaucus, son of Minos, as Melisagoras, 5th century BCE
relates. But Zeus, fearing that men might acquire the healing art from him and so come to the rescue
of each other, smote him with a thunderbolt. Phylodemus, 1st century CE. Was Asclepius struck
with lightning for raising Hippolytus, or Capaneus, and Lycurgus? Phylodemus, day Petate, 5220. Zeus
struck Asclepius by lightning, because according to the writer of the Nalpactica, 6th century BCE,
and the Asclepius of Thelestes, 4th century BCE, and the like-named work of the Lyric poet Sinnesius,
4th century BCE, he raised Hippolytus from the dead at the instance of Artemis. But according to
the Eryphale of Stesachorus, circa 645-555 BCE, it was because he raised Capaneus and Lycurgus.
Pliny the Elder, 1st century CE. Asclepius was killed for raising Tindarius to life. Pliny the Elder,
natural history, 29-1.321. Lucian, circa 120 CE. Zeus was angry with Asclepius over the resurrection
of Tindarius. Lucian, the dance, 4522. Sparta II affords not a few stories of this sort. The
resurrection of Tindarius, and Zeus' anger at Asclepius over it. Zeus must stop the quarreling
between Hercules and Asclepius over who should rank above the other. Lucian, dialogues of the gods,
Zeus, Asclepius, and Heracles. Zeus, stop quarreling, you two. You're just like a couple of men. It's
quite improper and out of place at the table of the gods. Heracles, but Zeus, do you really mean
this medicine man to have a place above me? Asclepius, he does by Zeus, for I'm your better. Heracles,
how you crack brain, because Zeus blasted you with his thunderbolt for your impious doings.
Four, and now you've received immortality because he relented and pitied you. Asclepius,
you must have forgotten Heracles how you too were scorched to death on Etta, T-5,
that you taunt me with getting burned. Heracles, that doesn't mean our lives were the same. I'm
the son of Zeus and performed all those labors cleaning up the world by overcoming monsters
and punishing men of violence, but you're just a herb chopper and quack, useful perhaps, among
suffering humanity for administering potions, but without one manly deed to show. Asclepius,
have you nothing to say of how I healed your burns when you came up half scorched the other day?
Between the tunic and the fire after it, your body was in a fine mess. Besides, if nothing else,
I was never a slave like you, carding wool in Lydia, wearing purple and being beaten with
Omefale's golden sandal, and what's more, I never killed my wife and children in a fit of spleen.
Heracles, if you don't stop insulting me, you'll pretty soon find out that your immortality won't
help you much. I'll pick you up and throw you head first out of heaven so that you'll crack
your skull, and not even Apollo the Healer will be able to do anything for you. Zeus, stop it,
I say. Don't disturb our dinner party, or I'll send you both from the table,
but it's only reasonable, Heracles, that Asclepius should have a place above you as he died before
you. Sextus empiricus, circa end of 2nd century CE. Sextus empiricus, in his examination of popular
myths and scholarly stories about Asclepius, inadvertently underscores the deep association
of this god with the extraordinary feat of raising the dead. His intent to demonstrate the uncontrollable
nature of myths instead highlights how entrenched the notion of Asclepius' powers, miraculous powers,
had become in the collective consciousness. This paradoxical outcome of Sextus empiricus' critique
reveals the enduring strength and influence of mythological narratives. The stories of Asclepius
' ability to defy the ultimate boundary of life and death had become so ingrained in cultural
and scholarly discourse that even in an attempt to critique or rationalize them, these stories
only gained further prominence. This phenomenon illustrates the complex relationship between
myth, belief, and scholarly inquiry in the ancient world, where even skeptical analyses could reinforce
the legendary status of deities like Asclepius. Asclepius was slain by Zeus for raising the dead
of a falsehood that is so multi-formed that it cannot be checked and changes its shape at each
man's fancy. There can be no technical treatment. Sextus empiricus against the professors 1, 260,
to 26, 227. But particular histories are both infinite because of their great number and without
fixity, because the same facts are not recorded by all respecting the same person. For instance,
for it is not out of place to use familiar and appropriate examples of the facts. The historians
adopting a false assumption say that Asclepius, the founder of our science, was struck by lightning
and not content with this falsehood. They invent many variations of it. Stesichorus, 640, 5.555,
saying in Irifoli that it was because he, Asclepius, had raised up some of the men who had fallen at
Thebes, polyanthus of Cyrene, date unknown. In his work on the origin of the Asclepiedes,
that it was because he had cured the daughters of Preetus who had become mad, owing to the wrath of
Hera, Panias's circa 500 BCE, that it was owing to his raising up the dead body of Tindereos,
Staphalus, circa 300 BC. In his book about the Arcadians, that it was because he had healed
Hippolytus when he was fleeing from Trozen, according to the reports handed down about him
in the tragedies. Philarchus, 3rd century BCE. In his 9th book, that it was because he restored
their sight to the blinded sons of Phineas, as a favor to their mother Cleopatra, the daughter
of Erich Theus. Telusarchus, Hellenistic historian, in his Argolicum, that it was because he set
himself to raise up Orion. Thus, of an assumption which begins with a falsehood and is so multi-form
that it cannot be checked, and changes its shape at each man's fancy, there can be no
technical treatment. Pausanias, circa 150 CE. In description of Greece, Pausanias, a notable
ancient geographer, provides detailed accounts of religious legends, including those of Asclepius.
He focuses on Asclepius' birth, his renowned healing abilities,
and his power to raise the dead, as seen in Epidaurus. Pausanias also highlights a significant
legend where Asclepius resurrects Hippolytus after his death by Thesias, further illustrating Asclepius'
exceptional role in Greek mythology. Soon after Asclepius' birth, it was reported that he was
healing and raising the dead. Pausanias' Corinth, description of Greece, 126-4-528.
As the child lay exposed, he was given milk by one of the goats that pastured about the mountain
and was guarded by the watchdog of the herd. And when Arestanus, for this was the herdsman's name,
discovered that the tail of the goats was not full, and that the watchdog also was absent from the
herd, he left, they say, no stone unturned, and on finding the child desired to take him up. As he
drew near, he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and thinking that it was something divine,
as in fact it was, he turned away. Presently, it was reported over every land and sea that
Asclepius was discovering everything he wished to heal the sick, and that he was raising dead men
to life. Hippolytus dedicated 20 horses to Asclepius in thanksgiving Pausanias' Corinth,
description of Greece, 127-4-5. Apart from the others, Steely thanking Asclepius for various cures,
is an old slab which declares that Hippolytus dedicated 20 horses to the god, Asclepius.
The Euricians tell a tale that agrees with the inscription of this slab, that when Hippolytus
was killed owing to the curses of Theseus, Asclepius raised him from the dead. On coming to life again,
he refused to forgive his father, rejecting his prayers he went to the Eurichians in Italy.
A Foreign Deity, Isis
In the rich landscape of Greco-Roman mythology, Isis stands as a figure of profound depth and
mystery. Celebrated for her unwavering loyalty as a wife and her deep affection as a lover,
she also shines as the epitome of maternal care, offering her protection to everyone,
regardless of their social status. Her cult, renowned for its sacred mysteries, held a significant
place in the spiritual life of the Mediterranean. Distinctly different from the gods of the Olympian
Pantheon, Isis is not bound by the fates. She wields the extraordinary power to alter future
events, a privilege she extends to her followers. This ability elevates her role beyond that of a
healer. She is venerated as the ruler of the cosmos and the personification of universal goodness.
For those interested in delving deeper into the mythos and significance of Isis within
the Greco-Roman root world, Plutarch's Isis and Osiris is an essential text, offering a
comprehensive examination of her attributes and cultural impact.
Hills Diseases Isidoris, circa 88 BCE Isis, manifold miracles, were your care that you
might bring livelihood to humankind and morality to all. Isidoris, hymn to Isis, 1-1-5.
You taught customs that justice might in some measure prevail. You gave skills that men's life
might be comfortable and you discovered the blossoms that produce edible vegetation. Because of you,
heaven and the whole earth have their being.
Isidoris, hymn to Isis, 1-6-24.
And the gusts of the winds and the sun with its sweet light. By your power the channels of Nile
are filled, everyone. At the harvest season and its most turbulent water is poured on the whole
land that produce may be unfailing. All mortals who live on the boundless earth, Thracians,
Greeks and Barbarians, express your fair name, a name greatly honored among all, but each speaks
language in his own land. The Syrians call you, a starter, Artemis, Nanaya, the Lysian tribes
call you, Leto the Lady. The Thracians also name you as Mother of the Gods. And the Greeks call
you, Hera of the Great Throne, Aphrodite, Hestia, the Goodly, Raya and Demeter. But the Egyptians
call you Theues because they know that you being one are all other goddesses invoked by the races
of men. You save all who are in pain through long anguished sleepless nights. Isidoris, hymn to Isis,
1-25-38. Mighty one, I shall not cease to sing of your great power, deathless saviour. Many named
mightiest Isis, saving from war, cities and all their citizens. Men, their wives, possessions
and children. As many as are bound fast in prison in the power of death. As many as are in pain
through long anguished sleepless nights. All who are wanderers in a foreign land and as many as
sail on the great sea in winter. When men may be destroyed and their ships wrecked and sunk. All
these are saved if they pray that you be present to help. Hear my prayers, O one whose name has
great power. Prove yourself merciful to me and free me from all distress. Isidoris wrote it.
Diadoris Sicilis wrote 60 to 30 BCE. Now that she is immortal, Isis finds her greatest delight
in the healing of humankind. Diadoris Sicilis, the library of history, 1-25-2-331.
As for Isis, the Egyptians say that she was the discoverer of many health-giving drugs and was
greatly versed in the science of healing. Consequently, now that she has attained immortality,
she finds her greatest delight in the healing of mankind and gives aid in their sleep to those
who call upon her. Plainly manifesting both her very presence and her beneficence towards men
who ask her help. Standing above the sick in their sleep, she gives them aid for their disease and
works remarkable cures upon such as submit themselves to her. Diadoris Sicilis, the library
of history, 1-25-4-5. In proof of this, as they say, they advance, not legends, as the Greeks do,
but manifest facts. For practically, the entire inhabited world is their witness,
in that it eagerly contributes to the honors of Isis because she manifests herself in healings.
For standing above the sick in their sleep, she gives them aid for their diseases and works
remarkable cures upon such as submit themselves to her. 32. And many who have been despaired of
by their physicians because of the difficult nature of their malady are restored to health by her,
while numbers who have altogether lost the use of their eyes or of some other part of their body,
wherever they turn for help to this goddess, are restored to their previous condition.
Raises the dead. Isis discovered the drug which gives immortality by means of which
she raised her persecuted son from the dead, Diadoris Sicilis, the library of history, 1-25-6.
Furthermore, she discovered also the drug which gives immortality by means of which she not only
raised from the dead her son Horus, who had been the object of plots on the part of the titans,
and had been found dead under the water, giving him his soul again, but also made him immortal.
And it appears that Horus was the last of the gods to be king after his father Osiris departed
from among men. Isis's son, Horus, is now a benefactor of the human race through his
oracular responses and his healings. Diadoris Sicilis, the library of history, 1-25-7.
Moreover, they say that the name Horus, when translated, is Apollo, and that having been
instructed by his mother Isis in both medicine and divination, he is now a benefactor of the race
of men through his oracular responses and his healings. Whatsoever laws I have established,
these no one can make void.
Now I am not unaware that some historians give the following account of Isis and Osiris. The
tombs of these gods lie in Nissa in Arabia, and in that place there stands also a steely of each
of the gods, bearing an inscription in hieroglyphs. On the steely of Isis it runs, I am Isis, the queen
of every land, she who was instructed of Hermes, and whatsoever laws I have established, these no
man can make void. I am the eldest daughter of the youngest god Cronus. I am the wife and sister
of the king Osiris. I am she who first discovered fruits for mankind. I am the mother of Horus,
the king. I am she who riseth in the star that is in the constellation of the dog.
By me was the city of Bubastus built. Farewell, farewell, O Egypt that nurtured me.
The most common way for a hero to be an agent in a miracle is by winning a god's favor to do it.
In the Greco-Roman period, we begin to see the kind of miracle story in which the hero
works a miracle without prayers to a deity. Such stories invite speculation on the source
of the power, of course. The narrators of this type of story sometimes offer the interpretation
by an internal reference, that is, some allusion to a well-known text might be found in the story,
or on the lips of some character. Dr. Windy Cotter's research revealed five classes of heroes
who are attributed with miraculous healings, each type representing its own particular reason
for the power. The five types or classes are presented in descending order of popular familiarity
to the Greco-Roman world. In the first category are the two Pythagoreans, Pythagoras himself
and his famous disciple, Empedocles. The lore that these Pythagoreans were able to
chase away pestilences arises from the fact that Pythagoras and his disciples, like Empedocles,
probed the secrets of nature. It was only to be expected that nature's intelligent entities would
come to know these philosophers intimately. Thus, it is no surprise if Pythagoras and Empedocles
could call upon their insider knowledge of nature to chase off an epidemic. We need to remember that
in the cosmology of Greco-Roman antiquity, the elements of creation are both living and rational
entities. A second category is that of three political rulers, one Greek king and two Roman
emperors. Plutarch does not explain why it is that King Pyrrhus is able to heal the spleen
just by touch. In a metaphor of praise Phylo gives to Caesar Augustus the power of healing the
pestilences of trouble infecting the world. Vespasian's healings are interpreted by Suetonius as
events designed to correct the new emperor's lack of prestige and certain divinity. Since it is the
god Serapus who sends the two sick men to Vespasian, it is clear that the great god of the Egyptians
will likewise give to Vespasian all manner of miraculous powers. The itinerant philosopher
and miracle worker Apollonius of Tyanna occupies the third category, although he is identified as a
Neopythagorean by Phylostratus. The old legends about him date from the late first century and
illustrate that he is better understood as a rather eclectic holy man rather than a Neopythagorean.
Apollonius' miracles seem to be the result of his personal holiness and the forces of nature
as well as the Daemon forces seem to bow to him into his total purity of life. In the fourth
category is the famous physician of Augustus, Esclipiades, who received many honors for his cure
of the emperor's rheumatism. He is attributed with saving a girl from burial by recognizing
that the force of life was still within her. His salvation of the girl belongs to his keen
knowledge that intelligence that understands nature so very well. His story is mentioned here
because as Celsus remarks, conclusions that someone might be dead can be completely mistaken.
Esclipiades is so revered because the wonders associated with him seem to mark him out as
someone extraordinarily graced by the gods. The fifth type of hero are the prophets of Jewish
Scripture, Moses, Elijah, and Elisha. In the healing miracles attributed to them, the narrators
sometimes include the significance to be drawn from the account. For example, in Moses' dependence
on God's instructions, or in the case of Elijah by the cry of the widow of Zarephath,
now I know that you are a man of God and the word in your mouth is truth, 1 Kings 17, 24.
Elisha's cure of Naaman, the Syrian of leprosy, 2 Kings 5, 14, has no prayer to God as even Naaman
expected but the prophet's order to wash in the Jordan. The divine power of Elisha is more
heavily underlined. Jewish tradition in these prophetic stories is usually a guarantee of
the reliability of the prophet as a spokesperson of God. Following the five types of heroes,
I'm presenting the collection of the Jesus miracles to invite the scholar to decide for him
or herself which traditions from antiquities seem to find an echo in Jesus' accounts.
As a final word, it will be noted that as the case of the gods of healing, so too,
several of the heroes who heal are attributed with having raised someone from the dead. With the
exception of Pythagoras, Moses, and the political rulers, Pyrrhus, Augustus, and Vespasian,
all the heroes, Empedocles, Apollonius, Elijah, Elisha, and Jesus, raise the dead.
Greek Classical Philosophers
Pythagoras, 582 to 500 BCE, Hills Diseases, Porphyry, 222 or 223 through to 305 CE.
Pythagoras chases away a pestilence. Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras, 291.
Verified predictions of earthquakes are handed down. Also, that he immediately chased away a
pestilence, suppressed violent winds and hail, calmed storms on both rivers and seas,
for the comfort and safe passage of his friends. Pythagoras prepared songs for the diseases of
the body by singing by which he cured the sick. Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras, 332.
His friends he loved exceedingly, being the first to declare that the goods of friends are common,
and that a friend is another self. While they were in good health, he always conversed with them.
If they were sick, he nursed them. If they were afflicted in mind, he solaced them,
some by incantations and magic charms, others by music. He had prepared songs for the diseases of
the body by singing which he cured the sick. He had also some that caused forgetfulness of sorrow,
mitigation of anger, and destruction of lust. Iamblichus, 250-325 CE. Pythagoras is said to
be responsible for the rapid expulsions of pestilences. Iamblichus, Life of Pythagoras, 283.
Many other more admirable and divine particulars are likewise unanimously and uniformly related of
the man. Pythagoras, such as infallible predictions of earthquakes, rapid expulsions of pestilences
and hurricanes, instantaneous cessations of hail, and tranquilizations of the waves of rivers and
seas in order that his disciples might the more easily pass over them. Impedocles, 484-424 BCE.
Hills diseases. Diogenes laertes, circa 250 CE. Impedocles saves a woman from a month-long trance.
Diogenes laertes, Impedocles, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, 860-614.
Heraclides in his book on diseases says that he, Impedocles, furnished Porcinius with the
facts about the woman in a trance. This Porcinius, according to Aristipus and Satterus,
was his Impedocles bosom friend, to whom he dedicated his poem on nature. At all events,
Heraclides testifies that the case of the woman in a trance was such that for 30 days,
he, Impedocles, kept her body without pulsation, although she never breathed. And for that reason,
Heraclides called him not merely a physician, but a diviner as well, deriving titles from
the following lines also. All the suffering come to the new God, Impedocles. Diogenes laertes,
Impedocles, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, 862.
My friends, who dwell in the great city, sloping down to yellow acrogas,
hard by the citadel, busied with goodly works, all hail. I go about among you an immortal God,
no more immortal, so honored of all, as his meat, crowned with fillets and flowery garlands.
Straightway, as soon as I enter with these men and women into flourishing towns,
I am reverenced and tens of thousands follow, to learn where is the path which leads to welfare.
Some desirous of oracles, others suffering from all, kinds of diseases desiring to hear a message
of healing. He also raises the dead. Impedocles saves the life of Panthea, who was given up by
doctors. Impedocles cures Panthea, who was given up by doctors. Diogenes laertes, Impedocles,
Lives of Eminent Philosophers, 869. Hermippus tells you that Impedocles cured Panthea,
a woman of agregentum, who had been given up by the physicians. And this was why he was offering
sacrifice, and that those invited were about 80 in number. The rulers who heal. A Greek king,
King Pyrrhus of Epirus, 319 to 272 BCE. While the ancient Pythagoreans heal through an intimate
knowledge of nature and its forces, this king's power to heal is unexplained. Perhaps the fact
that Pyrrhus was an enemy of Rome may account for Plutarch's portrait of him. Here we can note that
by the Greco-Roman period, there are more stories of a king's power to heal. This power would be
explained as one sign of the king's divine empowerment from heaven for his authoritative
role on earth. This account by Plutarch may be a case of damning with faint praise.
He heals diseases. King Pyrrhus healed spleen trouble of even the most poor simply by his touch.
Plutarch, Pyrrhus, Lives, 345. In the aspect of his countenance, Pyrrhus had more of the terror
than of the majesty of kingly power. He had not many teeth, but his upper jaw was one continuous
bone on which the usual intervals between the teeth were indicated by slight depressions. People
of a splenetic habit believed that he cured their ailment. He would sacrifice a white cock and while
the patient lay flat upon his back would press gently with his right foot against the spleen.
Nor was Ney one so obscure or poor as not to get this healing service from him if he asked it.
Let's look at Roman emperors who heal. Augustus, 63 BCE to 14 CE. Augustus heals the
pestilences of the world by the pacts. Philo, the embassy to Gaius, 144 to 1456.
The whole human race, exhausted by mutual slaughter, was on the verge of utter destruction.
Had it not been for one man and leader, Augustus, whom men fitly call the averture of evil, this
is the Caesar who calmed the torrential storms on every side, who healed pestilences common to
Greeks and barbarians. Pestilences which descending from the south and east course to the west and
north, sowing seeds of calamity over the places and waters which lay between them.
Vespasian, 9 through 79 CE. Tacitus writes of Vespasian. He lived 56 to 115 approximately CE.
Vespasian's cure of the blind man and the restoration of a man's useless hand marked the favor of heaven
and a certain partiality of the gods toward him. Tacitus, histories, 4, 8, 17.
During the months while Vespasian was waiting at Alexandria for the regular season of the summer
winds and a settled sea, many marvels occurred to mark the favor of heaven and a certain partiality
of the gods toward him. One of the common people of Alexandria, well known for his loss of sight,
threw himself before Vespasian's knees, praying him with groans to cure his blindness.
Being so directed by the god Serapis, whom this most superstitious of nations worships before all
others, and he besought the emperor to deign to moisten his cheeks and eyes with his spittle.
Another whose hand was useless, prompted by the same god, begged Caesar to step and trample on it.
Vespasian at first ridiculed these appeals and treated them with scorn. Then when the men persisted,
he began at one moment to fear the discredit of failure, at another to be inspired with hopes of
success by the appeals of the suppliants and the flattery of his courtiers. Finally, he directed
the physicians to give their opinion whether such blindness and infirmity could be overcome
by human aid. Their reply treated the two cases differently. They said that in the first, the case
of the blind man, the power of sight had not been completely eaten away, and it would return if the
obstacles were removed. In the other, the useless hand. The joints had slipped and become displaced,
but they could be restored if a healing pressure were applied to them. Such perhaps was the wish
of the gods, and it might be that the emperor had been chosen for this divine service. In any case,
if a cure were obtained, the glory would be Caesar's, but in the event of failure, ridicule would fall
only on the poor suppliants. So Vespasian, believing that his good fortune was capable of anything,
and that nothing was any longer incredible, ate with a smiling countenance and amid intense
excitement on the part of the bystanders, did as he was asked to do. The hand was instantly
restored to use, and the day again shone he for the blind man. Both facts are told by eyewitnesses
even now when falsehood brings no reward. Vespasian understands his healings from a vision
in the temple. He is royalty, tacitus, histories, 482. These events, the healing of the blind man
and the cure of the useless hand, gave Vespasian a deeper desire to visit the sanctuary of the god,
Serapis, to consult him with regard to his imperial fortune. He ordered all to be excluded
from the temple. Then, after he had entered the temple and was absorbed in contemplation of the
god, he saw behind him one of the leading men of Egypt named Basilides, who he knew was detained
by sickness in a place many days journey distant from Alexandria. He asked the priests whether
Basilides had entered the temple on that day. He questioned the passersby whether he had been seen
in the city. Finally, he sent some cavalry and found that at that moment he had been 80 miles
away. Then, he concluded that this was a supernatural vision and drew a prophecy from the name Basilides.
Suetonius writes of Vespasian. He wrote in 41 to 69 CE. Vespasian's miracle gives him the prestige
and divinity he lacked. Suetonius, divine Vespasian, lives of the Caesars, 7, 210. Vespasian has yet
lacked prestige and a certain divinity, so to speak, since he was an unexpected and still new-made
emperor. But these also were given him. A man of the people, i.e. in Alexandria, who was blind,
and another who was laying, came to him together as he sat on the tribunal, begging for the help
for their disorders, which Serapis had promised in a dream. For the god declared that Vespasian
would restore the eyes if he would spit upon them and give strength to the leg, if he would deign
to touch it with his heel. Though he had hardly any faith that this could possibly succeed and
therefore shrank even from making the attempt, he was at last prevailed upon by his friends and
tried both things in public before a large crowd and with success. Deo Cassius wrote of Vespasian
in 194 to 229 CE. Heaven was magnifying Vespasian by miracles, but the Alexandrians detested him.
Deo Cassius, Roman history 65, 811. Following Vespasian's entry into Alexandria,
the Nile overflowed, having in one day risen a palm higher than usual. Such an occurrence,
it was said, had taken place only once before. Vespasian himself healed two persons, one having
a withered hand, the other being blind, who had come to him because of a vision seen in dreams.
He cured the one by stepping on his hand and the other by spitting upon his eyes.
Yet though heaven was thus magnifying him, the Alexandrians, far from delighting in his presence,
detested him so heartily that they were forever mocking and reviling him. For they had expected
to receive from him some great reward because they had been the first to make him emperor.
But instead of securing anything, they had additional contributions levied upon them.
The itinerant philosopher of imperial times, Apollonius of Tiana, circa 98 CE.
The sole surviving account of Apollonius of Tiana, a wandering holy man of antiquity,
is authored by Flavius Philo Stratus, who lived approximately between 170 and 249 AD.
Philo Stratus composed this biography at the behest of Empress Julia Domna, wife of emperor
Septimius Severus. The Empress held Apollonius in high esteem and sought to counteract claims
that he was merely a magician. The authenticity and reliability of Philo Stratus' work
have been subjects of scholarly debate. Central to this debate is the character of Damus,
presented as a disciple of Apollonius and the author of an initial biography. Damus is widely
considered a fictional creation of Philo Stratus. However, the dismissal of the
miracle stories associated with Apollonius is not as straightforward. These accounts
present a more complex challenge to historians and scholars. Philo Stratus himself, a neo-Pythagorean,
would have faced significant philosophical conflicts in fabricating such miracle stories.
Neo-Pythagoreanism, characterized by its philosophical principles,
would deem the creation of such fantastical tales incongruous with its doctrines.
If Apollonius was indeed a follower of this school, as Philo Stratus acknowledges,
it seems improbable that he would have concocted these miracles, which starkly contrast with his
philosophical learnings. This incongruity adds a layer of complexity to the assessment of the
historical accuracy of Apollonius' miraculous deeds as recorded by Philo Stratus. He heals
diseases. Apollonius cures a lame man and a blind man. You can also see Mark 8, 22 through 26,
Mark 10, 46 through 52, and Luke 4, 16 through 30. Philo Stratus, life of Apollonius of Tyanna,
3, 3,912. Apollonius cures a paralyzed hand,
Philo Stratus, life of Apollonius of Tyanna, 3, 39. Apollonius is responsible for a woman
successfully giving birth. Philo Stratus, life of Apollonius of Tyanna, 3, 39.
Apollonius heals a boy bitten by a mad dog. Philo Stratus, life of Apollonius of Tyanna,
6, 4313. Here, too, is a story which they tell of him in Tarsus. A mad dog had attacked a lad,
and as a result of the bite, the lad behaved exactly like a dog, for he barked and howled and went on
all four feet using his hands as such, and ran about in that manner. And he had been ill in this
way for 30 days, when Apollonius, who had recently come to Tarsus, met him and ordered a search to
be made for the dog, which had done the harm. But they said that the dog had not been found,
because the youth had been attacked outside the wall when he was practicing with javelins,
nor could they learn from the patient what the dog was like, for he did not even know himself
anymore. Then Apollonius reflected a moment and said, O damis, the dog is a white shaggy sheepdog,
as big as an amphilochian hound, and he is standing at a certain fountain trembling all over,
for he is longing to drink the water, but at the same time is afraid of it. Bring him to me to the
bank of the river, where there are the wrestling grounds, merely telling him that it is I who
call him. So damis dragged the dog along, and it crouched at the feet of Apollonius, crying out
as a supplicant might do before an altar. But he quite tamed it by stroking it with his hand,
and then he stood the lad close by, holding him with his hand. And in order that the multitude
might be cognizant of so great a mystery, he said, the soul of telophus of Misia has been transferred
into this boy, and the fates impose the same things upon him as upon telophus. And with these words,
he bade the dog lick the wound all round where he had bitten the boy, so that the agent of the wound
might in turn be its physician and healer. After that, the boy returned to his father and
recognized his mother, and saluted his comrades as before, and drank of the waters of the Sidnos.
Nor did the sage neglect the dog either, but after offering a prayer to the river,
he sent the dog across it, and when the dog had, crossed the river, he took his stand on the
opposite bank and began to bark, a thing which mad dogs rarely do, and he folded back his ears and
wagged his tail because he knew that he was all right again. For a draft of water cures a mad dog
if he has only the courage to take it. He also raises the dead. Apollonius raises from the dead
a young bride. Apollonius said to the people, put down the beer, for I will stay your tears.
Phylostratus, life of Apollonius of Tyanna, 445. Here, too, is a miracle which Apollonius worked,
a girl had died just in the hour of her marriage, and the bridegroom was following her beer,
lamenting as was natural. His marriage left unfulfilled, and the whole of Rome was mourning
with him, for the maiden belonged to a consular family. Apollonius then, witnessing their grief,
said, put down the beer, for I will stay the tears that you are shedding for this maiden.
And with all, he asked, what was her name? The crowd accordingly thought that he was
about to deliver such an oration, as is commonly delivered as much to grace the funeral as to
stir up lamentation. But he did nothing of the kind, but merely touching her and whispering in
secret. Some spell over her at once woke up the maiden from her seeming death, and the girl spoke
out loud and returned to her father's house, just as Alcestis did when she was brought back to life
by Hercules. And the relations of the maiden wanted to present him with the sum of a hundred and
fifty thousand. Cestertis, but he said that he would freely present the money to the young lady
by way of a dowry. Now, whether he detected some spark of life in her, which those who were nursing
her had not noticed, for it is said that although it was raining at the time, a vapor went up from
her face, or whether life was really extinct, and he restored it by the warmth of his touch,
is a mysterious problem which neither I myself, nor those who were present, could decide.
The physician Esclipiades, first century BCE. Esclipiades, a distinguished physician of the
Augustan era, gained significant recognition for his unconventional medical approaches,
particularly noted successfully treating Augustus's rheumatism, contrary to the
prevailing medical practices of the time, which often involved hot water baths,
as Esclipiades employed cold treatments, a method that proved effective where traditional
treatments had failed. His medical philosophy and practice were deeply rooted in Epicurean thought,
markedly diverging from Hippocratic principles that dominated contemporary medicine.
The Hippocratic tradition was centered around the concept of the four bodily humors,
and the idea of a natural law governing health. In stark contrast, Esclipiades rejected these
notions, focusing instead on the maintenance of atomic stability within the patient. This approach
emphasized the significance of immediate and individualized care, prioritizing factors such as
diet, environmental conditions, and emotional well-being in the treatment process. Esclipiades'
method highlights a distinct shift from the conventional medical wisdom of his time, placing
greater emphasis on the physical and mental state of the patient, rather than inhering to a standardized
set of treatments based on the theory of humors. His contributions to medicine during the Augustan
era are notable for their innovative approach and departure from the traditional practices.
He raises the dead. Esclipiades' revival of a girl thought dead proves how deceiving the signs
of death often are. Kelsus, on medicine, 2, 6, 16 through 1814.
And such is the characteristic of a conjecture, that though it answers more frequently, yet it
sometimes deceives. A sign, therefore, is not to be rejected if it is deceptive in scarcely one
out of a thousand cases, since it holds good in countless patients. I state this, not merely in
connection with noxious signs, but as to salutary signs as well, seeing that hope is disappointed
now and again, and that the patient dies whom the practitioner, at first, deemed safe. And further,
that measures proper for curing now and again, make a change into something worse,
nor in the face of such a variety of temperaments, can human frailty avoid this. Nevertheless,
the medical art is to be relied upon, which more often, and in by far the greater number of patients,
benefits the sick. It should not be ignored, however, that it is rather in acute diseases
that signs, whether of recovery or of death, may be fallacious.
The famous Asclepiades, who ranks among the greatest of doctors,
indeed, if you accept Hippocrates, as the very greatest, was the first to discover the use
of wine as a remedy. It requires, however, to be administered at the proper moment,
and it was in the discovery of the right moment that he showed special skill, noting most,
carefully the slightest symptom of disorder or undue rapidity of the pulse. It chanced that once,
when he was returning to town from his country house, he observed an enormous funeral procession
in the suburbs of the city. A huge multitude of men who had come out to perform the last honors
stood round about the beer, all of them plunged in deep sorrow and wearing worn and ragged apparel.
He asked whom they were burying, but no one replied, so he went nearer to satisfy his curiosity
and to see who it might be that was dead, or it may be in the hope to make some discovery
in the interests of his profession. Be this as it may, he certainly snatched the man from the
jaws of death as he lay there on the verge of burial. The poor fellow's limbs were already
covered with spices, his mouth filled with sweet smelling unguent. He had been anointed
and was all ready for the pyre, but Asklipiades looked upon him, took careful note of certain signs,
handled his body again and again, and perceived that the life was still in him,
though scarcely to be detected. Straight away, he cried out, he lives, throw down your torches,
take away your fire, demolish the pyre, take back the funeral feast, and spread it on his board
at home while he spoke. A murmur arose, some said that they must take the doctor's word,
others mocked at the physician's skill. At last, in spite of the opposition offered even by his
relations, perhaps because they had already entered into possession of the dead man's property,
perhaps because they did not yet believe his words. Asklipiades persuaded them to put off the
burial for a brief space. Having thus rescued him from the hands of the undertaker, he carried the
man home, as it were from the very mouth of hell, and straight away revived the spirit within him,
and by means of certain drugs, sixteen called forth, the life that still lay hidden in the
secret places of the body. Ancient heroes from the Jewish scriptures, Moses, depicting him,
circa 1200 BC, though the texts are much later. In the story of the people's cure of snakebites,
it is God who heals them, but Moses, who is their advocate. The people do not see God, but they do
see Moses, his designated leader of these people. Thus, Moses' role is that of God's agent, but
it is clear from the story that it is God who is responsible for the salvation, heals people of snakebites.
Moses intercedes for the people and follows the Lord's commands for their healing,
Numbers 21, 4-9.
among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died.
7. The people came to Moses and said,
We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you.
Pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.
So Moses prayed for the people.
8. And the Lord said to Moses,
Make a poisonous serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.
9. So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole.
And whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.
Elijah, circa 900 BCE, though the text are most likely much later, raises the dead.
Elijah's prayer wins back the life of the widow's son.
This story, and the one that follows about Elisha, again engaged the idea that a man empowered with
the authority from God will be able to call back the dead. In this case, Elijah's miracle is interpreted
for us by the widow. And the widow said to Elijah,
Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
See Mark 5, 21-43 and John 11, 1-46 below, or when we get there.
1 Kings 17, 17-24
O man of God, you have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son.
19. But he said to her, Give me your son.
He took him from her bosom, carried him up into the upper chamber where he was lodging,
and laid him on his own bed.
20. He cried out to the Lord, O Lord my God, have you brought calamity,
even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?
21. Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried out to the Lord,
O Lord my God, let this child's life come into him again.
22. The Lord listened to the voice of Elijah. The life of the child came into him again,
and he revived. 23. Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper chamber into the house,
and gave him to his mother. Then Elijah said, See, your son is alive.
24. So the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God,
and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
25. Josephus writing around 63 to 79 CE, a retelling of the Elijah miracle.
The mother thanked the prophet and said that now she clearly realized that the deity spoke with him.
26. Josephus, Jewish antiquities, 8, 325 to 32,717.
27. Now the woman of whom we spoke above, the widow of Saretha, who gave food to the prophet,
her son fell ill so seriously that he ceased to breathe and seemed to be dead,
whereupon she wept bitterly, injuring herself with her hands and uttering such cries as her
grief prompted, and she reproached the prophet for having come to her to convict her of sin,
and on that account causing the death of her son. But he urged her to take heart
and give her son over to him, for he would, he said, restore him to her alive.
So she gave him over, and he carried him into the chamber in which he himself lived,
and placed him on the bed. Then he cried aloud to God, saying that he would ill-requite,
the woman who had received him and nourished him. If he took her son from her, and he prayed God
to send the breath into the child again, and give him life thereupon God, because he took pity on
the mother, and also because he wished graciously to spare the prophet from seeming to have come to
her for the purpose of harming her, and beyond all expectation brought the child back to life.
Then the mother thanked the prophet and said that now she clearly realized that the deity spoke with him.
2 Kings 5, 1-19
1 went in and told his Lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said,
5, and the king of Aram said, Go then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.
He went, taking with him 10 talons of silver, 6,000 shekels of gold, and 10 sets of garments.
6, he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, When this letter reaches you,
know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his leprosy.
7, when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said,
Am I God to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy?
Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me.
8, but when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes,
he sent a message to the king, Why have you torn your clothes?
Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel.
9, so Naaman came with his horses and chariots and halted at the entrance of Elisha's house.
10, Elisha sent a messenger to him saying, Go, wash in the Jordan seven times,
and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.
11, but Naaman became angry and went away, saying, I thought that for me he would surely come out
and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and would wave his hand over the spot and cure
the leprosy. 12, are not Abana and Farfar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of
Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean? He turned and went away in a rage. 13, but his
servants approached and said to him, Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something
difficult, would you not have done it? How much more? When all he said to you was, Wash and
be clean. 14, so he went down and immocid himself seven times in the Jordan. According to the word
of the man of God, his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean. 15,
then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company. He came and stood before him and said,
Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Please accept a present from
your servant. 16, but he said, As the Lord lives whom I serve, I will accept nothing. He urged him
to accept, but he refused. 17, then Naaman said, If not, please let two mule loads of earth be
given your servant, for your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any
God except the Lord. 18, but may the Lord pardon your servant on one count. When my master goes
into the house of Riman to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow down in the house of Riman,
may the Lord pardon your servant on this one count. 19, he said to him, Go in peace.
To punish Ghazi's sacrilegious greed, Elisha causes Naaman's leprosy to fall upon him
and his family forever, 2 Kings 19 through 27. But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance,
20, Ghazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, thought, My master has let that Aramean Naaman
off too lightly by not accepting from him what he offered. As the Lord lives, I will run after him
and get something out of him. 21, so Ghazi went after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running
after him, he jumped down from the chariot to meet him and said, Is everything all right?
22, he replied, Yes, but my master sent me to say, Two members of a company of prophets have just
come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two
changes of clothing. 23, Naaman said, Please accept two talents. He urged him and tied up
two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothing and gave them to two of
his servants who carried them in front of Ghazi. 24, when he came to the citadel,
he took the bags from them and stored them inside. He dismissed the men and they left.
25, he went in and stood before his master and Elisha said to him, Where have you been,
Ghazi? He answered, Your servant has not gone anywhere at all. 26, but he said to him,
Did I not go with you in spirit when someone left his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to accept
money and to accept clothing, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen and male and female
slaves? 27, therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.
So he left his presence leprous as white as snow, raises the dead. Elisha's prayer wins the life of
the woman's dead son. It is clear to anyone familiar with the Elijah account that this story
is an expansion upon it. In both cases, the petitioner is a non-Jewish woman who has offered
hospitality to a Jewish prophet. The prophet is recognized as holy by the strength of his prayers.
We can expect that this story was taught to early Christians as they became more and more
familiar with the heroes of the Jewish tradition. She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground,
then she took her, restored son and left, 2 Kings 4, 18 through 37. 18, when the child whom Elisha
had promised God would grant to a woman who was kind to him, was older, he went out one day to
his father among the reapers. 19, he complained to his father, Oh my head, my head, the father said
to his servant, carry him to his mother. 20, he carried him and brought him to his mother. The child
sat on her lap until noon and he died. 21, she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
closed the door on him and left. 22, then she called to her husband and said, send me one of the
servants and one of the donkeys so that I may quickly go to the man of God and come back again.
23, he said, why go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. She said, it will be all right.
24, then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, urge the animal on, do not hold back for
me unless I tell you. 25, so she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of
God saw her coming, he said to Gahazi, his servant, look, there is the shunamite woman. 26, run at once
to meet her and say to her, are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?
She answered, it is all right. 27, when she came to the man of God at the mountain,
she caught hold of his feet. Gahazi approached to push her away, but the man of God said,
let her alone, for she is in bitter distress. The Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me.
28, then she said, did I ask my Lord for a son? Did I not say, do not mislead me? 29, he said to
Gahazi, gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, give no
greeting and if anyone greets you, do not answer and lay my staff on the face of the child. 30,
then the mother of the child said, as the Lord lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave
without you. So he rose up and followed her. 31, Gahazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the
face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. He came back to meet him and told him,
the child has not awakened. 32, when Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on
his bed. 33, so he went in and closed the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord. 34,
then he got up on the bed and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon
his eyes and his hands upon his hands. And while he lay bent over him, the flesh of the child became
warm. 35, he got down, walked once to and fro in the room, then got up again and bent over him.
The child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes. 36, Elisha summoned Gahazi and said,
call the Shonomite woman. So he called her. When she came to him, he said, take your son. 37,
she came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground. Then she took her son and left.
The Healing Miracles of Jesus
Hills Diseases. Jesus heals Simon's mother-in-law of a fever. He came and took her by the hand
and lifted her up. Then the fever left her and she began to serve him. Mark 1, 29-31,
Matthew 4, 1-11, Luke 4, 1-13. 29, as soon as they left the synagogue,
they entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John. 30, now Simon's mother-in-law was
in bed with a fever and they told him about her at once. 31, he came and took her by the hand
and lifted her up. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them. Jesus heals a leper,
moved with pity. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him,
I do choose, be made clean. Mark 1, 40-45, Matthew 8, 1-4, Luke 5, 12-16, 40, a leper came to him,
begging him and kneeling, he said to him, If you choose, you can make me clean. 41,
moved with pity. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, I do choose,
be made clean. 42, immediately the leprosy left him and he was made clean. 43, after sternly
warning him, he sent him away at once. 44, saying to him, See that you say nothing to anyone, but
go. Show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as a testimony to
them. 45, but he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word so that Jesus
could no longer go into a town openly, but stayed out in the country. And people came to him from
every quarter. Jesus heals 10 lepers. Then Jesus asked, We're not 10 made clean, but the other
nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?
Luke 17, 11-19. 11, on the way to Jerusalem, Jesus was going through the region between Samaria
and Galilee. 12, as he entered a village, 10 lepers approached him, keeping their distance.
13, they called out saying, Jesus master, have mercy on us. 14, when he saw them, he said to them,
Go and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were made clean. 15, then one of them,
when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. 16, he prostrated
himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. 17, then Jesus asked, We're not 10
made clean, but the other nine, where are they? 18, was none of them found to return and give praise
to God except this foreigner? 19, then he said to him, Get up and go on your way. Your faith has
made you well. Jesus heals a man who is paralyzed, but so that you may know that the Son of Man has
power on earth to forgive sins. And he said to the paralytic, I say to you, stand up, take your mat,
and go to your home. Mark two, one through 12, Matthew nine, one through eight, Luke five, 17
through 26. One, and when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at
home. Two, so many gathered around that there was no longer room for them, not even in front of the
door. And he was speaking the word to them. Three, then some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed
man, carried by four of them. Four, and when they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd,
they removed the roof above him. And after having dug through it, they let down the mat on which the
paralytic lay. Five, and when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Son, your sins
are forgiven. Six, now some of the scribes were sitting there questioning in their hearts. Seven,
why does this fellow speak in this way? It is blasphemy. Who can forgive sins but God alone? Eight,
at once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves.
And he said to them, why do you raise such questions in your hearts? Nine, which is easier
to say to the paralytic, your sins are forgiven. Or to say, stand up and take your mat and walk.
Ten, but so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. And he said
to the paralytic, 11, I say to you, stand up, take your mat and go to your home. 12, and he stood up
and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them so that they were all amazed and
glorified God, saying, we have never seen anything like this. Jesus heals the paralyzed servant of
a Centurion. And to the Centurion, Jesus said, go, let it be done for you according to your faith.
The servant was healed in that hour. Matthew eight, five through 13, Luke seven, one through 10.
Five, when he entered Capernaum, a Centurion came to him, appealing to him. And six, saying, Lord,
my servant is lying at home, paralyzed in terrible distress. Seven, and he said to him,
I will come and cure him. Eight, the Centurion answered, Lord, I am not worthy to have you
come under my roof, but only speak the word and my servant will be healed. Nine, for I also am
a man under authority with soldiers under me. And I say to one, go and he goes and to another,
come and he comes and to my slave do this and the slave does it. Ten, when Jesus heard him,
he was amazed and said to those who followed him, truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found
such faith. Eleven, I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Twelve, while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown
into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Thirteen, and to the
Centurion, Jesus said, go, let it be done for you according to your faith. And the servant was healed
in that hour. This story would not be classified as a miracle story because according to form
criticism, the focus is on the faith exchange of the soldier and Jesus. But as far as content is
concerned, Jesus is being approached by the Centurion precisely because the soldier sees him
as a healer with heavenly authority. Moreover, the fact that the Centurion's servant is healed from
a distance, emphasized Jesus, empowerment from heaven, which demonstrates itself in the most
compassionate ways. Jesus heals the sick child of a royal official. Jesus said to him, go, your son
will live. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him. As he was going down, his slaves met
him and told him that his child was alive. John 4, 46 to 54. 46. Then he came again to Cana in
Galilee, where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill
in Capernaum. 47. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him
to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 48. Then Jesus said to him,
unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe. 49. The official said to him,
sir, come down before my little boy dies. 50. Jesus said to him, go, your son will live.
The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way. 51. As he was going down,
his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive. 52. So he asked them the hour when he
began to recover. And they said to him, yesterday at one in the afternoon, the fever left him. 53.
The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him, your son will live. So he
himself believed along with his whole household. 54. Now this was the second sign that Jesus did
after coming from Judea to Galilee. Jesus heals the man by the pool called Bethzathah. Jesus said
to him, stand up, take your mat, and walk. And once the man was made well and he took up his mat,
began to walk. John 5, 1 through 18. 46. Then he came again to Cana in Galilee,
where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in
Capernaum. 47. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to
come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 48. Then Jesus said to him,
unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe. 49. The official said to him,
sir, come down before my little boy dies. 50. Jesus said to him, go, your son will live. The man
believed the one. After this, there was a festival of the Jews. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
2. Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool called in Hebrew Bethzathah, which has five
porticoes. 3. In these lay many invalids, blind, lame, and paralyzed. 5. One man was there who had
been ill for 38 years. 6. When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time,
he said to him, do you want to be made well? 7. The sick man answered him, sir, I have no one to
put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. And while I am making my way, someone else steps
down ahead of me. 8. Jesus said to him, stand up, take your mat and walk. 9. At once, the man was
made well, and he took up his mat and began to walk. 10. Now that day was a Sabbath. So the Jews
said to the man who had been cured, it is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry your mat.
11. But he answered them, the man who made me well said to me, take up your mat and walk. 12. They
asked him, who is the man who said to you, take it up and walk? 13. Now the man who had been healed
did not know who it was, for Jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there. 14. Later, Jesus
found him in the temple and said to him, see, you have been made well, do not sin any more,
so that nothing worse happens to you. 15. The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who
had made him well. 16. Therefore the Jews started persecuting Jesus, because he was doing such things
on the Sabbath. 17. But Jesus answered them, my father is still working, and I also am working.
18. For this reason, the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because he was not only
breaking the Sabbath, but was also calling God his own father, thereby making himself equal to God.
18. Jesus heals a man withered hand on the Sabbath. He looked around at them with anger.
He was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man, stretch out your hand. He stretched
it out, and his hand was restored. Mark 3, 1-6, Matthew 12, 9-14, Luke 6, 17-19.
5. According to form criticism, this unit of tradition is categorized as a controversy story,
because the healing is subordinated to the healing. However, I include it here because
it is very doubtful that earliest Christian listeners would have made such distinctions.
In the story, Jesus stands up to the authorities to restore this man's hand,
and for many a working person, this story would have emphasized Jesus' great humanitas as a healer.
Jesus heals a woman from her 18-year infirmity on the Sabbath. When Jesus saw her, he called her
over and said to her, Woman, you are set free from your ailment. Immediately, she stood up
straight and began praising God, Luke 13, 10-17. 10. Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues
on the Sabbath. 11. And just then, there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for
18 years. She was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight. 12. When Jesus saw her,
he called her over and said, Woman, you are set free from your ailment. 13. When he laid his
hands on her, immediately she stood up straight and began praising God, 14. But the leader of the
synagogue indignant because Jesus had cured on the Sabbath kept saying to the crowd, There are six
days on which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be cured and not on the Sabbath day.
15. But the Lord answered him, You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox
or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to give it water? 16. And ought not this woman,
a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for 18 long years, be set free from this bondage on the
Sabbath day, 17. When he said this, all his opponents were put to shame and the entire crowd was
rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing. 17. Jesus heals a man with dropsy on the
Sabbath. Jesus said, Is it lawful to cure people on the Sabbath or not? They were silent. So Jesus
took him and healed him and sent him away. Luke 14, one through six. 1. On one occasion, when Jesus
was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the Sabbath, they were watching
him closely. 2. Just then, in front of him, there was a man who had dropsy. 3. And Jesus asked the
lawyers and Pharisees, Is it lawful to cure people on the Sabbath or not? 4. But they were silent.
So Jesus took him and healed him and sent him away. 5. Then he said to them, If one of you has a
child or an ox that has fallen into a well, will you not immediately pull it out on the Sabbath
day? 6. And they could not reply to this. 7. Jesus heals a woman suffering from hemorrhage for 12
years. She said, If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well. 8. Immediately, her hemorrhage
stopped and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. Mark 5, 21 through 34.
Matthew 9, 18 through 26. Luke 8, 40 through 48. 21. When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to
the other side, a great crowd gathered around him and he was by the sea. 22. Then one of the leaders
of the synagogue named Jairus came and when he saw him, fell at his feet. 23. And begged him
repeatedly, My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her so that
she may be made well and live. 24. So he went with him and a large crowd followed him and pressed
in on him. 25. Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for 12 years. 26. She
had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and she was no better,
but rather grew worse. 27. She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and
touched his cloak. 28. For she said, If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well. 29. Immediately
her hemorrhage stopped and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. 30. Immediately
aware that power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, Who touched my
clothes? 31. And his disciples said to him, You see the crowd pressing in on you. How can you say
who touched me? 32. He looked all around to see who had done it. 33. But the woman,
knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him and told him
the whole truth. 34. He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be
healed of your disease. 35. Jesus heals a man who is deaf and has a speech impediment.
36. Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, Epthatha, that is to be opened,
and immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.
Mark 7, 31 through 37, Matthew 15, 29 through 31. 31. Then he returned from the region of Tyre
and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis. 32. They
brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech and they begged him to lay his hand
on him. 33. He took him aside in private, away from the crowd and put his fingers into his ears
and he spat and touched his tongue. 34. Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him,
Epthatha, that is, be opened, 35. And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released,
and he spoke plainly. 36. Then Jesus ordered them to tell no one, but the more he ordered them,
the more zealously they proclaimed it. 37. They were astounded beyond measure, saying,
He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.
38. Jesus hills the blind man of Bethsaida. Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again and he
looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly. Mark 8, 22 through 26.
22. They came to Bethsaida. Some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him.
23. He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village and when he had put saliva
on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, Can you see anything? 24. And the man looked up
and said, I can see people, but they looked like trees, walking 25. Then Jesus laid his hands on
his eyes again and he looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly.
26. Then he sent him away to his home saying, Do not even go into the village.
Jesus hills the blind man, Bartimaeus. The blind man said to Jesus, Master, let me see again.
Jesus said to him, Go, your faith has been made you well. Immediately he regained his sight and
followed him on the way. Mark 10, 46 to 52. Matthew 20, 29 through 34. Luke 18, 35 through 43.
46. They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples in a large crowed were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus,
son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. 47. When he heard that it was Jesus of
Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. 48. Many sternly
ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly. Son of David, have mercy on me. 49.
Jesus stood still and said, Call him here. And they called the blind man, saying to him,
Take heart, get up. He is calling you. 50. So throwing off his cloak,
he sprang up and came to Jesus. 51. Then Jesus said to him, What do you want me to do for you?
The blind man said to him, My teacher, let me see again. 52. Jesus said to him, Go,
your faith has made you well. Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.
53. Jesus hills a man born blind. Jesus spat on the ground and made mud and saliva and spread
the mud on the man's eyes, saying to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. Then he went and
washed and came back, able to see John 9, 1-41. 1. As he walked along, he saw a man blind from birth.
2. His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind?
3. Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned. He was born blind,
so that God's works might be revealed in him. 4. We must work the works of him who sent me
while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work. 5. As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world. 6. When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva
and spread the mud on the man's eyes. 7. Saying to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,
which means sent. 8. Then he went and washed and came back,
able to see. 8. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask,
Is this not the man who used to sit and beg? 9. Some were saying, It is he. Others were saying,
No, but it is someone like him. He kept saying, I am the man. 10. But they kept asking him,
Then how were your eyes opened? 11. He answered, The man called Jesus made mud,
spread it on my eyes and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash. Then I went and washed
and received my sight. 12. They said to him, Where is he? He said, I do not know. 13.
They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. 14. Now it was a Sabbath
day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. 15. Then the Pharisees also began to ask him
how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put mud on my eyes.
Then I washed and now I see. 16. Some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God,
for he does not observe the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner
perform such signs? And they were divided. 17. So they said again to the blind man,
What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened. He said, He is a prophet. 18.
The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight,
until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight. 19. And asked them,
Is this your son who you say was born blind? How then does he now see? 20. His parents answered,
We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 21. But we do not know how it is
that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him, He is of age. He will speak for
himself. 22. His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already
agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. 23.
Therefore his parents said, He is of age. Ask him. 24. So for the second time they called the man
who had been blind. And they said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner. 25.
He answered, I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I know, that though I was blind,
now I see. 26. They said to him, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes? 27. He answered
them, I have told you already and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you
also want to become his disciples? 28. Then they reviled him saying, You are his disciple, but we
are disciples of Moses. 29. We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we do not
know where he comes from. 30. The man answered, Here is an astonishing thing. You do not know
where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes. 31. We know that God does not listen to sinners,
but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will. 32. Never since the world began
has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. 33. If this man were not from
God, he could do nothing. 34. They answered him, You were born entirely in sins and are you trying
to teach us? And they drove him out. 35. Jesus heard that they had driven him out and when he
found him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of man? 36. He answered, And who is he, sir? Tell me
so that I may believe in him. 37. Jesus said to him, You have seen him and the one speaking with
you is he. 38. He said, Lord, I believe and he worshiped him. 39. Jesus said, I came into this
world for judgment so that those who do see may see and those who do not see may become blind.
40. Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, Surely we are not blind,
are we? 41. Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say,
We see, your sin remains. 41. Jesus' miracle will fill the prophet Isaiah. No prophet is acceptable
in his own country. Luke 4, 16 through 30. 16. When he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up,
he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read 17 and the
scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where
it was written. 18. The spirit of the Lord is up on me because he has anointed me to bring good news
to the poor. He sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind,
to let the oppressed go free. 19. To proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. 20. And he rolled up
the scroll, gave it to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
21. Then he began to say to them, Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. 22.
All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. They said,
Is not this Joseph's son? 23. He said to them, Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb,
Doctor cure yourself. And you will say, Do hear also in your hometown the things that we have
heard you did at Capernaum. 24. And he said, Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the
prophet's hometown. 25. But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah
when the heaven was shut up three years and six months. And there was a severe famine over all
the land. 26. Yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarefath in Sidon. 27. There
were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha. And none of them was cleansed
except Naaman the Syrian. 28. When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage.
29. They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which
their town was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff. 30. But he passed through the midst
of them and went on his way. Rises from the dead. Jesus raises a 12 year old girl from the dead.
Some people come. Let me say that again. Some people came from the leader's house to say,
Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any further? But overhearing what they said,
Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe. Mark 5, 21-43,
Matthew 9, 18-26, Luke 8, 40-56. 21. When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side,
a great crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea. 22. Then one of the leaders of the
synagogue named Jairus came. And when he saw him, fell at his feet. 23. And begged him repeatedly,
My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be made
well and live. 24. So he went with him. And a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him.
25. Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for 12 years. 26. She had endured
much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had. And she was no better, but rather
grew worse. 27. She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.
28. For she said, If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well. 29. Immediately her hemorrhage
stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. 30. Immediately aware that
power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, Who touched my clothes?
31. And his disciples said to him, You see the crowd pressing in on you. How can you say, Who
touched me? 32. He looked all around to see who had done it. 33. But the woman, knowing what had
happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 34.
He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed of your disease.
35. While he was still speaking, some people came from the leader's house to say, Your daughter is
dead. Why trouble the teacher any further? 36. But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the
leader of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe. 37. He allowed no one to follow him except Peter,
James, and John, the brother of James. 38. When they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue,
he saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. 39. When he had entered, he said to them,
Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping. 40. And they laughed at him.
40. Then he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him,
and went in where the child was. 41. He took her by the hand and said to her,
To lether come, which means little girl, get up, 42. And immediately, the girl got up and began to
walk about. She was 12 years of age. At this, they were overcome with amazement. 43. He strictly
ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat.
44. Jesus raises the only son of a widow from the dead. When the Lord saw her,
he had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep. 45. Then he came forward and touched the
beer and the bearers stood still. 46. And he said, Young man, I say to you, rise.
47. Luke 7, 11-17. 11. Soon afterwards, he went to a town called Nain,
and his disciples and a large crowd went with him. 12. As he approached the gate of the town,
a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother's only son, and she was a widow,
and with her was a large crowd from the town. 13. When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her
and said to her, Do not weep. 14. Then he came forward and touched the beer and the bearers
stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to you, rise. 15. The dead man sat up and began to speak,
and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16. Fear seized all of them, and they glorified God, saying,
A great prophet has risen among us, and God has looked favorably on his people. 17. This word
about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding country. 18. Jesus raises his friend
Lazarus from the dead. 19. Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me,
but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you
sent me. 20. When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out. 21. John 11,
1-46. 1. Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
2. Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her
brother Lazarus was ill. 3. So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, Lord, he whom you love is ill.
4. But when Jesus heard it, he said, This illness does not lead to death,
rather it is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.
5. Accordingly, though Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,
6. After having heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.
7. Then after this, he said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again.
8. The disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you,
and are you going there again? 9. Jesus answered, Are there not 12 hours of daylight?
Those who walk during the day do not stumble, because they see the light of this world.
10. But those who walk at night stumble, because the light is not in them.
11. After saying this, he told them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
but I am going there to awaken him. 12. The disciples said to him,
Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be alright. 13. Jesus, however, had been speaking about his
death, but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep. 14. Then Jesus told them plainly,
Lazarus is dead. 15. For your sake, I am glad I was not there,
so that you may believe. But let us go to him. 16. Thomas, who was called the twin,
said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
17. When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. 18.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away, 19. And many of the Jews had come to
Martha and Mary to console them about their brother. 20. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,
she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home. 21. Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been
here, my brother would not have died. 22. But even now, I know that God will give you whatever
you ask of him. 23. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again. 24. Martha said to him,
I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day. 25. Jesus said to her,
I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live. 26.
And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this? 27. She said to him,
Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world. 28.
When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary and told her privately,
The teacher is here and is calling for you. 29. And when she heard it, she got up quickly
30. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still at the place where Martha had
met him. 31. The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly
and go out. They followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep
there. 32. When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him,
Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 33. When Jesus saw her weeping,
and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved.
34. He said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see. 35. Jesus began to weep.
36. So the Jews said, See how he loved him. 37. But some of them said, Could not he who opened
the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying? 38. Then Jesus again, greatly disturbed,
came to the tomb. It was a cave and a stone was lying against it. 39. Jesus said, Take away the
stone. Martha, the sister of the dead man said to him, Lord, already there is a stench because he
has been dead four days. 40. Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed you would
see the glory of God? 41. So they took away the stone and Jesus looked up war and said, Father,
I thank you for having heard me. 42. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the
sake of the crowd standing here so that they may believe that you sent me. 43. When he had said
this, he cried with a loud voice. Lazarus, come out. 44. The dead man came out. His hands and feet
bound with strips of cloth and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, Unbind him and let
him go. 45. Many of the Jews, therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed
in him. 46. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what he had done.
47. The Healing Miracles in Jesus' Name
Acts of the Apostles The healings in Jesus' name that would find their way
to the Acts of the Apostles provide more evidence about the significance of Jesus' own miracles
for these communities. Both the actual miracle story and the interpretation attached to it
when one occurs are included. Peter heals the infirm. Peter heals a crippled beggar in Jesus'
name. By faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know,
and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.
Acts 3, 1-16. 1. One day, Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. 2. And a man lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay
him daily at the gate of the temple, called the Beautiful Gate, so that he could ask for arms
from those entering the temple. 3. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple,
he asked them for arms. 4. Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said,
Look at us. 5. And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.
6. But Peter said, I have no silver or gold. But what I have, I give you. In the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk. 7. And he took him by the right hand and raised him up,
and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. 8. Jumping up, he stood and began to walk,
and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 9. All the people saw
him walking and praising God. 10. And they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for arms
at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what
had happened to him. 11. While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them
in the portico called Solomon's. Portico, utterly astonished. 12. When Peter saw it,
he addressed the people, You Israelites, why do you wonder at this? Or why do you stare at us,
as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? 13. The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed
over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. 14. But you
rejected the holy and righteous one, and asked to have a murderer given to you. 15. And you killed
the author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. 16. And by faith in his
name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know. And the faith that is through
Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you. 17. Peter hills the
paralyzed Aeneas in Jesus's name. 18. Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ,
hills you, get up and make your bed. 19. And immediately he got up, Acts 9, 32-35.
30. Now as Peter went here and there among all the believers, he came down also to the saints
living in Lidder. 33. There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years,
for he was paralyzed. 34. Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ, heals you, get up and
make your bed. And immediately he got up, 35. And all the residents of Lidder and Sharon saw him
and turned to the Lord. 35. Raises the dead. Peter raises Tabitha from the dead in Jesus' name.
Peter put all them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said,
Tabitha, get up. Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. He gave her his hand
and helped her up. Acts 9, 36-42. 36. Now in Joppa, there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha,
which in Greek is Dorcus. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity. 37. At that time,
she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs. 38. Since Lidder
was near Joppa, the disciples who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request,
please come to us without delay. 39. So Peter got up and went with them. And when he arrived,
they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and
other clothing that Dorcus had made while she was with them. 40. Peter put all of them outside,
and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, Tabitha, get up. Then she
opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. 41. He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then
calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive. 42. This became known throughout Joppa,
and many believed in the Lord. 43. Paul hills the infirm. Paul is given his sight by Ananias,
in Jesus' name, saw as blinded by the light from heaven, Acts 9, 1-9. 1. Meanwhile, Saul,
still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest.
2. And asked him for letters, too. The synagogues at Damascus. So that if he found any who belonged
to the way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3. Now, as he was going along
and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4. He fell to the
ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? 5. He asked,
who are you, Lord? The reply came, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 6. But get up and
enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do. 7. The men who were traveling with him
stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one. 8. Saul got up from the ground,
and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand, and brought him
into Damascus. 9. For three days, he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
10. Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision,
Ananias. He answered, Here I am, Lord. 11. The Lord said to him, Get up and go to the street
called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment,
he is praying 12. And he is seen in a vision, a man named Ananias come in, and lay his hands on
him so that he might regain his sight. 13. But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many
about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem. 14. And here he has authority
from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name. 15. But the Lord said to him, Go,
for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings,
and before the people of Israel. 16. I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake
of my name. 17. So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said,
Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you
may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. 18. And immediately something like scales
fell from his eyes and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized. 19. And after
taking some food, he regained his strength. 20. Paul cures a lame man. When the crowd saw what Paul
had done, they shouted in the Lyconian language. But gods have come down to us in human form.
Acts 14. 8-18. 8. In Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet and had never walked,
for he had been crippled from birth. 9. He listened to Paul as he was speaking,
and Paul looking at him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed. 10. Said in a loud voice,
Stand upright on your feet, and the man sprang up and began to walk. 11. When the crowd saw what
Paul had done, they shouted in the Lyconian language. The gods have come down to us in human form.
12. Barnabas. They called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
13. The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the
gates. He and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice. 14. When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of
it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting, 15. Friends, why are you doing
this? We are mortals just like you, and we bring you good news that you should turn from these
worthless things to the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that
is in them. 16. In past generations, he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways. 17.
Yet he has not left himself without a witness in doing good, giving you rains from heaven and
fruitful seasons and filling you with food and your hearts with joy. 18. Even with these words,
they scarcely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them. Paul raises the dead, but Paul
went down and bending over him, took him in his arms and said, do not be alarmed for his life is
in him. Acts 27 through 12. 7. On the first day of the week, when we met to break bread, Paul was
holding a discussion with them. Since he intended to leave the next day, he continued speaking until
midnight. 8. There were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting. 9. A young man
named Uticus, who was sitting in the window, began to sink off into a deep sleep while Paul
talked still longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell to the ground three floors below and was picked up,
dead. 10. But Paul went down and bending over him, took him in his arms and said,
do not be alarmed for his life is in him. 11. Then Paul went upstairs, and after he had broken
bread and eaten, he continued to converse with them until dawn. Then he left. 12. Meanwhile,
they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted.
Exorcisms Next
I hope you see by now with 45 non-Christian accounts of gods performing healing, miracles,
and 19 what we call pagan accounts of heroes who performed miracles, totaling to 64 primary
examples. These claims of miraculous powers were serious enough that temples to these gods were
all over the Roman Empire. You saw firsthand the primary sources, and this is just a glimpse
of the overall materials in antiquity. We limited our scope to roughly around the beginnings of
Christianity. And a few centuries after, because we wanted you to see, the pagan world also had
stories of their gods and heroes performing very similar feats to Jesus. I want to thank scholars
like Dr. Wendy Cotter, who put together this list of sources as a textbook for people to see.
I know many of the Christian persuasion will attempt to limit the scope of influence
from Jewish sources exclusively when the New Testament is swimming in the larger world of
Rome and reaching people well beyond Jews alone. Jesus was competing with the long-standing
existing Greek and Roman deities and heroes. No wonder Justin Martyr saw fit to compare Jesus
with the known gods and heroes of his time, stating that they believed nothing different
about their Christ as the Romans did about their gods. From raising the dead back to life,
giving sight back to the blind, hearing to the deaf, lame, crippled, diseased, mute, and more,
the Greek and Roman gods were already performing such miracles. Of course, we should have skepticism
of these stories ever having happened, but this is no different to the Jesus traditions. The narratives
of these healing miracles are all mythical and superstitious from MythVision's perspective.
You can see this special pleading and critical thinking kicks in when those who favor their
faith evaluate the other miraculous accounts. They are quick to discount the accounts of other
figures. I think I would have more respect intellectually if they consistently accepted
all of these miraculous events as likely having happened since they do this with Jesus or the
Jewish heroes. We should be consistent in being critical across the board. In the next documentary
in this series of the miraculous, we will dive into the various exorcism sources from beyond
the Jesus stories. I hope you will stay tuned. Like this video and descend into the comments
