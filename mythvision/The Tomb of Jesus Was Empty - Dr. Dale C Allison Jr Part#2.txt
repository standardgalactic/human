Ladies and gentlemen, I want to fly to Princeton University in New Jersey to interview Dell
C. Allison, Jr. Professor Allison is a very deep mind as you will see in this three-part
series here we did remotely.
I want to interview him in person, high definition and make history.
Go check out our Patreon, help join us to grow that, ask me questions, but if you help
participate I'll ask your questions.
I just need to meet this goal because in October I'd like to be up there and interviewing
him.
Dr. Dell Allison is joining me and I almost call you junior because when I go online
looking you up it's like it's Dell Allison and then there's Dell Allison Jr. and you're
both authors.
It's Dell C. Allison, Jr. and that's what I always want my publishers to put on books
and they don't always do it for reasons I can't fathom, but that is my name.
I think they're trying to address the four different points that are within you and
they're likeâ€¦
Okay.
So Dr. Allison one of the things I as a Christian believed is that a flesh and blood Jesus died
and a flesh and blood Jesus rose and he came out of the grave to show hey we're all one
day if you believe in me I'm kind of jumping here but one day you as well will rise physically
from the dead flesh and blood and have immortal bodies and the way I understood that as a
Christian many years ago is like the same exact body will somehow be immortalized but
not really picturing that's beyond our understanding especially when you see stuff like the transfiguration
you're kind of like what the heck is that am I going to look like that?
Well that's probably something pictured for those who are going to rise from the dead.
It seems I want to get into the empty tomb and possibly get into general resurrection
what is going on what's the teaching in the New Testament.
So first thing to say Paul mentions in passing a tomb he's buried is what it sounds like
where are you buried they didn't just you know go set him on top of the ground
there were literal tombs in this time historically that people were buried into.
The Gospels talk about Joseph of Arimathea.
I don't think he's put in there for no reason so can you tell us about what this is and how this
plays into the resurrection and last thing I'll say and then just let you take over is Dr Bart D
Ehrman believes that the Gospels are kind of legends about the empty tomb if I'm not mistaken
he's changed his position on this correct me if I'm wrong but tell me where you would disagree
or agree and how that plays into a the whole gospel scenario.
Okay so the view I take in in the book and which I dub as probable and not certain
is that there's memory behind the story of the burial and that there's memory behind the story
of women running into Jesus's empty tomb soon after he died so for me those are two historical
conclusions but they're probable they're not certain and somebody could convince me otherwise
down the road. Now I think that the two stories hang together that is I think the burial and the
empty tomb go together so what I do in the book is I have a whole chapter discussing whether the
story of Joseph of Arimathea goes back to a memory and then a whole chapter on whether
there's any history behind the story of the empty tomb. Now with regard to Joseph of Arimathea
the most popular skeptical proposal today is that the Romans as a rule when they crucified
people left them up on the cross right for scavengers for vultures or they took them down and just
threw them disrespectfully into a pile and the dogs dogs would eat them and that seems to have been
the normal course but I don't think that that's what happened with Jesus so first of all
the earliest tradition as you indicated is 1 Corinthians 15 and Paul says he was buried I
don't think he would speak that way if he were just thrown into a pile and eaten by dogs and then
the Gospels all four of them have a story of burials so I guess one observation I would make
doesn't establish that this is not a legend but it's worth noting I don't see a rival tradition
here some people have tried to find them here or there I don't I don't think that there that there
is a rival tradition the second thing is that Josephus actually says that the Jewish custom
is to take down even criminals from crosses and bury them before nightfall now that comes out of
the Pentateuch comes out of Moses Deuteronomy what is it 21 where you're not supposed to
leave a body on a tree overnight we know from the Dead Sea Scrolls and other texts that this
was understood to refer to crucifixion so what Josephus is saying is that we take down
criminals from crosses and implicit in this I think must be the idea that when it isn't a war
when it isn't wartime the Jews try to get bodies down to bury them and that's what happens
in the Gospels we also have a rabbinic text it's an extra mishneh tractate but it talks about
somebody being crucified and then the relatives going to the Roman authorities and asking for
the body now in this particular text the authorities say no and so the question is should we steal it
you know it's a pious thing to do to uh to get it back to what the point is is that this source
remembers or could remember that people asked for the bodies to come back we also have I don't know
if you've been to Jerusalem but we also have the body of a crucified man and it was found in an
ossuary it's pre-70 if you go to the the Israel Museum in Jerusalem you can see it it's in a
glass case wow and we know that this guy was crucified because they hammered his a nail into
his ankles to hold them together and and it went into a knot and when it was time to take him down
they couldn't get the nail out so they just cut the wood and the wood still there with the nail
in it and the ankles but the point is this guy was crucified and he was buried and this is pre-70
so here we have archaeological evidence of a crucified victim presumably a victim of Roman
crucifixion in the first century and he was given a burial a Jewish burial in a bone box
in an ossuary now sometimes people say well there's only one of those so that doesn't show
anything I think the problem with that argument is that we just don't have many skeletons at all
I remember talking to an archaeologist where are all the the bones where are all the skeletons
from first century burials and the answer is oh we don't know they're just not not there so
you know I think that's um that's a good argument and when you add that the gospels themselves seem
to think that this happened or at least make sense that somebody that a Jew would go to
a Roman authority and say could we have the body please for burial that's our custom
so I think that this story makes sense I also don't think that early Christians would have
um made this a burial by the member of a Sanhedrin that's really out of
sync with what what you find elsewhere in the gospels anyway um so for those reasons and others
I end up saying I think there's an historical memory here I think somebody in Joseph of Arimathea
buried Jesus by the way also there are rival accounts of how this story was created
and part of what I do in that chapter is try to argue that none of them um
none of them are persuasive all right so whether others are persuaded by that I don't know but
once I've concluded that chapter and said I think despite questions that we we have
um what was Joseph of Arimathea's intention was he doing this on his own was he acting as a member
of the Sanhedrin was he usually in charge of the the the burial of criminals what happened
to the other two bodies and so on I don't I don't know the answers to those questions but I think the
basic um memory um is still there oh oh one one more thing um I don't see why they would have
invented this story if it weren't true the my my reasoning there is they lived with crucifixion
crucifixion was shameful and abhorrent and terrible and I find it odd to say well Jesus
was crucified and the early Christians like Paul and first Corinthians can you know celebrate that
or wallow in it turn it into a positive but they just couldn't stand the thought that Jesus hadn't
been buried and so they made a burial story so he could be honored um I I think that's a little
odd they could they could live with a scandal and um and crucifixion so I I think they could have
lived with with with a burial um now if I could I'd like to I'd like to make a confession um as
someone who I was evangelical christian hardcore fundamentalist to full mythicist skeptic is
what I was not too long ago I'm still skeptic of course but I like to say a skeptic light someone
who um really doesn't buy that this is supernatural the same way I would apply to maybe looking at
another uh another religion if you will or even like Mormonism I would approach it with the same
tendencies as I would with Mormonism but a little bit different I would say because
Joseph Smith had some serious credibility issues whereas in this case it seems very traumatic the
time in which they're living is extremely traumatic and then we get into psychological stuff as to
why maybe someone might have postmortem experiences or whatever it might be that I look at natural
explanations and say they might make more sense to me but um but I want to make the confession to
you Dale and my audience I used to even think Jesus was only crucified in the heavens for a moment
kind of the Richard Carrier Dr. Price angled and what it seemed to me ad hoc because we have real
people being actually crucified in the first century and messianic figures at that by the Roman
Empire so it just seems like you talk about the connections between things seems to be the most
plausible that there's a real guy here and he actually gets crucified by Rome why the heck make
him shamed like that and in fact Mark doesn't end in the prettiest note in comparison by saying my
god my god why have you forsaken me like whoa that's very human that's uh even though it is
mimesis in a sense it's kind of a pressure if you will like borrowing from the Old Testament to
the mouth of Jesus it's still not pretty why make that up about your savior uh very tough stuff so
yeah yeah well I I'm I'm agreeing with you okay thank you uh I I think I again uh I can't prove
any of this that that word just doesn't work here but um there's something in New Testament
scholarship known as the criterion of embarrassment and I have problems with this
and I'm known as a critic of it but if it grows out of the claim that some of these traditions
are hard to understand as freely made up as creation ex the helo and um
you know that's what I'm doing in the book um I can I can look at Jesus eating and Jesus being
touched and say well you know I understand why somebody created that it's harder to do that
with Joseph of Arimathea and in my judgment nobody's made the good case for for that yet and um
I think I've made a decent case uh for the to the contrary can you tell our audience just briefly
like what others say don't go too deep and then mainly what you say and why well I just gave you
an outline of my reasons if you're talking about the burial right um but Joseph of Arimathea for
example um oh well I mean I nobody has come up with a I don't I don't know of any plausible
explanation for the invention of this name or making him a member of the Sanhedrin or putting
him in charge of Jesus's burial I don't throw one to you and get your thoughts on this yeah I've heard
Joseph Arimathea all right this is this is what I've heard and tell me how off you think this is
and I respect your your answer no matter what Joseph of Arimathea sounds very much like Joseph
Bar Mathias and here you have a Josephus uh supposed Josephus connection where Josephus talks
about going in his account I think it's biography and taking down three members his close friends
from the cross and two of them die but one of them survives his wounds and is alive um could
there be a parallel here in your world or not this just doesn't okay so I don't find that convincing
and one of the things that people always do when they're trying to look for an explanation for a
story is they're trying they find parallels okay I have a couple of places in this book
where I find astounding parallels and I parade them and they are completely bogus one of them I
just made up I just said I'm going to go looking for parallels between these two texts right right
and I found them so what you have to keep in mind is that if you have any two texts and work hard
enough you can always find some parallels and there are there are lots of stories out there
there's a story in Joshua about some people being killed and and put in a tomb and it's
got a rock and uh you know some people have worked with this and tried to do this or Daniel the
the lion's den you got a rock there and and and so on um or uh I thought the most creative was um
by a scholar named David House a us um who thinks that the story of Jesus burial and empty tomb is
based on moses traditions and he comes up with some really interesting fascinating uh this stuff
but again there are two problems one um I've spent a lot of time doing intertextuality
and I know how easy it is just to conjure parallels uh in response to house I said well
let's look at the story of of Joseph in the Old Testament and he buries somebody he buries
Israel and I drew all these parallels I said what about these uh the point is as frustrating as this is
we can always draw parallels between texts and sometimes we can't find astounding parallels and
I I I thought I gave several examples of this so you're going to have to have more than a few
parallels to convince me of anything but then the second problem is this people always write up
history they write up memories with templates with phrases that they have to hand with ideas
that they have to hand have to hand and so for example uh it's possible I don't know I don't
know whether truth is possible that the disciples had a vision of Jesus or maybe Peter had a vision
of Jesus uh and so I'm glowing okay so we've got accounts of people seeing other people glow
down through history whatever you want to want to make of it and then once that that was there
it then got written up so well does anybody else glow well it's Moses so we're gonna have Moses
here they're gonna have a cloud and they're gonna have a voice speaking from the cloud it's going
to be on a mountain I you know I don't know exactly how to sort out history and fiction here
but the point is is that I think people themselves when they're remembering can draw upon uh
parallels and even highly fictionalized things uh can have memories so um you can read a conspiracy
book on the assassination of president John F Kennedy and you would say oh oh I I I don't think
this is a myth but you know what somebody did shoot the guy right so you can have myths that grow up
out of historical events right uh so this then again becomes very complicated you can't just
say look at some parallels right um you have to say uh what is the complex process that gave us this
text and is there any memory involved so this so I don't I don't I don't buy your parallel
but it's because I've spent a lot of time um looking at parallels by the way I live across the
street from the Princeton Seminary Library which is a really uh first-class theological library
and you can go through there if you know what you're doing you can look at book after book
after book that draws phantom parallels between two texts commentaries on lube commentaries on
Deuteronomy commentaries on Jonah whatever I've all got their parallels and a lot of them are just bogus
they're just bogus well I want to I want to stand corrected that's uh not my parallel that's someone
else's but okay that's fine that's fine no I'm trying to be cautious not to have parallelomania
take place because and I don't mean it in derogatory term but I mean it like it really happens it's a
phenomenon like you say I would like to pitch a parallel before we get back just okay in this uh
empty tomb this tomb scenario uh maybe address Bart Ehrman's position if you don't mind but uh
Joseph the code of many colors story I founded this passion narrative kind of thing also with
Judas the betrayer Judas in one if you take the documentary hypothesis approach Judah is the one
who kind of is saying to Joseph let's get rid of them let's sell them okay um one of their brothers
is saying let's kill them the other one's saying let's sell them but I do take uh I think there's
some source material here that's kind of conflated by the redactor but nonetheless if you take this
approach I see Judah uh Judas just kind of the s on the end is one who sells his brother and I wonder
if Memesis is playing a role uh this is speculation but then Joseph gets in a dungeon I'm skipping
some stuff Potiphar uh I wonder if there's a parallel in some sense the Pontius pilot don't
know but he goes into a dungeon he's in charge of a dungeon he hears a dream and there's just three
days from now theme where the wine bearer and the bread uh the baker will one will resurrect to
condemnation one will resurrect so to speak I'm using anachronistic ideas from the New Testament
one's going to go back to status and don't forget me remember me well Jesus says in
remembrance of me and I wonder if there's a motif here deep into this tradition saying
you know the baker the bread the wine bearer the wine and there's somewhat of a Eucharist
tradition if you will playing a role do you think I'm on to something or is this parallel
Armenia I don't have any idea because that's not one I've looked at before but I'll tell
you what I do think if I'm looking at Judas in the New Testament I'm not back in Genesis I'm
actually uh in Samuel because there is the story of David and he has a betrayer and his name is a
hithafel and a hithafel is a trusted member of the inner circle and he betrays David David goes out
to the Mount of Olives he weeps there he asks God for deliverance and uh if you know that story
you'll also know that a hithafel he goes out and hangs himself Matthew says of Judas he went out
and hung himself Matthew's actually cut and pasted from that story all right so and also
one of the the the verses that cited about the friend and the and the bread in the Gospel of
John lifting his heel against me that's from a psalm that's attributed by the rabbis to
a hithafel so the problem is here what do you do when you have I got a bunch of good parallels here
and I got a good bunch of parallels here and I got a bunch of parallels here can they all be true
this is a real problem so one of the things I did years ago was I wrote a book called
The New Moses and it's a book on what I perceive as a Moses typology that runs throughout the
Gospel of Matthew and some people have read this book and said this is really good it's on target
other people have read it and said there's more here he hasn't seen everything that that's here
and others have read it said no he's a victim of parallel media Jesus isn't like Moses and so on
so this whole issue of intertextuality of how one source relates to another it really is very
difficult which is one reason why New Testament scholars for about 30 years now have been in a
debate looking for criteria criteria by which you can judge that one text is actually using another
or alluding to another you may be familiar with Dennis McDonald and some of his work so he sees
parallels with the between the gospels and let's say Homer right and some of them are interesting
but the truth is that most of the books haven't convinced a lot of people right so maybe the
gill has not been fair to him or maybe he's seen things that that aren't there actually I read one
of his books I think it was on Mark maybe and Homer I thought it was funny because the one place where
I see Homer in in in the gospels he doesn't see it it's the place where if you have faith you can
pluck up a mountain and throw it into the sea and if I ask have I ever seen that before yeah it's a
story of the Cyclops who takes a mountain and he throws it into sea anyway I don't have any idea
whether that has anything to do with the saying of Jesus but it's a it's a parallel as one he
didn't do anything with so um wow you have well well the the the question is broader than this what
do you do uh just with all these resurrection traditions so traditions so you can look at
Greco-Roman parallels to people who are exalted or maybe even their bodies are missing right
but then you can look at modern visionary stories of people who run into their dead
relatives and a lot of these parallels make sense um you can do parallels with Moses you
can do a lot with Moses there's a lot of Jewish lore about Moses you could draw these parallels
it used to be in the 19th century during the heyday of uh well I guess you would know this better
because it's been revived uh you know this well uh people would then draw all sorts of parallels
between the gospels and the Greek gods right so what does this tell us does it tell us we can just
find parallels where we want to or if we work hard enough we seek and we will find is is that what
this is uh and how do we tell which group of parallels is actually relevant to the subject at hand
and again I'm going to say this is very difficult and there are no simple answers and I've often
argued for parallels that other people have looked at and said that Allison doesn't know what he's
doing here uh and I'm sure I'm right wow so this I think it's important to practice certain tools
of milieu right trying to stick within the milieu uh because if we could we could make a parallel
right now for whatever president you know there's always something you're right um if I may on the
apotheosis thing and the missing bodies concept that we see within the Greco-Roman world this is
obviously taking place in a Hellenized you know Roman world and I love that we've been floating
around just kind of like discussing concepts and saying how these things are but if I were to ask
the skeptic within you to put on his cap for a second and to play uh skeptical on this
if you were to try and say look let me try and naturally explain what may have happened to you
based on the evidence that you've looked at and how you perceive all this information how would
you best explain this if you were trying to say well there wasn't a literal actual physical resurrection
of Jesus what happened was body what do you think is the best way to explain that from a
skeptic point of view okay I think there are uh two two theories and um actually argued for one of
in one of them in the book I said uh I want to be even-handed and I want to come up with the best
um skeptical hypothesis uh I can and part of my it's not agenda it's actually a conclusion
I think uh awful lot depends upon worldview and where you start and what you're rooting for uh
and so on anyway I think there are two possibilities one is the story of the empty
tomb is just a myth now I argue that it's not the strongest argument for it is that you can find
these parallels you can find some Greco-Roman parallels you can also find Christians later
on inventing stories of missing bodies um John the Baptist's father goes missing in a second century
uh Christian text I think I think it's that acts of Paul where Paul rises from the dead
comes back and talks to Nero after his head's been cut off so there is a case for
a mythological origin for the empty tomb and there again the Greek parallels the Roman parallels
would be the the strongest thing you have uh now I argued against that in the book but I said that
the issue uh is not an easy call and you can go back and forth and and and so on but if if I were
a skeptic that's not the view I would take if I were a skeptic the view I would take is that the
tomb of Jesus was robbed and uh we know from ancient sources the magical papyri and elsewhere
novels and so on that people stole bodies and they sometimes used them uh as for magical recipes
body parts the parts of people who were victims of an untimely death or victims of a violent death
or crucifixion victims we have we have some recipes we also know from the sources that this
is something that went on people stole bodies uh now if you're a naturalist a plausible story is
that Jesus was buried and somebody wanted the body for their own purposes and so they came
at night when else are you going to do this it's going to be at night and if you're in a hurry
you're not going to put the stone back over the door you're just going to run away right
and so if the women came then um they would find an empty tomb and they would find the stone
rolled away which is what you have uh in the gospel that also fit with the idea that like
later later legends if you will as we see in john where i think it's john or luke uh where you have
roman soldiers in a seal like they're adding this whole they're really yeah i think nobody's getting
this in this tomb if that makes sense so i think that the guard is later apologetics and it's in part
to get rid of this possibility that somebody stole the body i think john although he doesn't have the
guard he does as you may remember have the wrappings and nobody robbers aren't going to unwrap a body
before they steal it uh i think he's saying that this is evidence there was no robber it's neatly
rolled up and oh come on uh they're just gonna heft it and walk away right so there are signs i think
that early christians wondered about this or worried about this and this scenario would explain
an empty tomb with the stone rolled away right so i think i think that's the the simplest and
and best explanation for that now i want to be fair um i'm not your typical skeptic i would like to
hear what seems to be the most plausible apologetic approach that you would you would take and i mean
a scholarly you know approach as an apologist saying i'm putting on the apologist hat now
this seems to be the best data i wouldn't put because i know you're not an apologist but
it's i think it's only fair to kind of give the other side if you don't mind well the other side
would say there's no evidence for that it's purely hypothetical what an odd coincidence that
jesus predicted his own resurrection and then somebody stole the body conveniently to make them
think this uh it just would be an odd series of coincidences for which there is no concrete
evidence is very speculative uh they would say now i don't think uh that that should trouble the
skeptic the skeptic i think could just say well coincidences aren't that uh uncommon and it's less
unlikely than a guy rising from the dead what are the odds of that you know compared to the to the
other thing but but then i think the apologist would say you can't think about the empty tomb
in isolation then you also have to think about the appearances and then of course their go-to thing
is collective appearances one person can hallucinate if you've got a several there then what are you
going to do um that's a very interesting argument because um you know if you got first hand witnesses
and you independently quizzed them and they all came up with the same sort of report and they
haven't had time to you know uh talk to each other about it so on that would be really evidential
right uh the problem is that's not what we have we've got these later sources and the the sources
actually say some people doubted some people who doubted who were there so uh i i think that the
apologist case can't be argued to its end i don't think uh now i should add autobiographically that
i was really hoping for more when i started out that is when i started out as a historian of early
christianity i was hoping to be able to do more things than i've been able to do so i've been i've
been frustrated and um yeah i'll just say that i've been frustrated there are fewer things that
i can establish than i had hoped i could establish right wow so i guess one last thing on that topic
is predictive things you are big on apocalyptic uh or at least the eschatological stuff in the new
testament which i so cannot wait to come and visit you there's there's so much i would love
to do videos just on matthew and talk about the new moses and there's so many things i'd love to
talk to you about and i could tease the audience with about like what's going on with matthew 10
and 15 i came only for the law sheep or only go to the law sheep who are the law sheep what is this
is this jews only or what is going on there's people who believe that scattered lost tribes
visual play a role somewhere there's so many things i want to do and i want maybe people who
are watching this to see we need to have a recordings just to probe and ask so final thing
predictive stuff jesus predicts the fall of the temple is this anachronistic and it's saying oh
it's not unlikely that a guy thought the temple's going down especially when if i can use the kumran
sec the escenes are already saying hey this temple's no good anyway look it's the herodian temple
the leadership and it's no good but i want to focus on jesus predicting his own death
and going to paul does paul say jesus predicted his own death um or is this legendary kind of
things in the gospels okay so paul does it seems to imply that jesus predicted his own death the
reason is in first chrithy it's 11 he's got the words of the last supper and jesus is presumably
alive when he's uttering these and he's talking about his death right so paul is assuming that
jesus foresaw his own uh death and by the way he assumes this elsewhere he assumes this it seems to
me in um philippians 2 for example uh behind this is the notion that jesus didn't run away from death
or that jesus wasn't arrested and forced you know uh that jesus somehow didn't resist when that when
the time came he gave him himself so so that's a notion in in paul now the problem of whether
jesus predicted his own death and resurrection is very complex and nobody likes the position i hold
which is the only reasonable one and which uh i share with albert swizer so jesus believed in a
near end and if you look at jewish literature from antiquity the end doesn't just come it's a series
of things and they're all terrible it's always darkest before the dawn it's what you find today
in christian dispensational circles that is there's a great tribulation and then the end comes well
the idea that there's a horrible tribulation and that the saints die and are persecuted and everything
goes so bad hey it's in daniel uh it's in the gospel it's all over the place it's in jewish
literature is a major theme uh we actually had a book several years ago written on the great
tribulation it's all over the place so if jesus thinks the end is near what does he think is near
well among the things that are near are tribulation for the saints right because that's everywhere
and beyond that reward and bliss and resurrection so my take is that jesus because he thought the
end was proximate thought that he and his followers would suffer persecution that some of them would
die but of course god would vindicate them uh afterwards um so i think the passion predictions
go back to prophecies of eschatological affliction and reward they've been narrowed because that's
what you do after the facts you rewrite things you narrow them down i can't think of any context
in which a first century jew could have said uh yeah i'm gonna die and then i'm gonna rise three
days later i just i don't know the context for such a thing but the thing i just shared with you
is a is a context that makes sense and it makes sense to the data in in the gospels it's just
perfectly reasonable actually if jesus if you were interviewing jesus and he said i think the
end is near and you said well what does that involve uh he would have said three or four things and
one of them would have been resurrection and one of them would have been yeah it's going to be tough
because the end is near uh the saints of the most high are going to be persecuted haven't you read
the book of daniel what's wrong with you there's it's everywhere so it's in the gospels there's
gonna be such tribulation as never was you know before the end so what i think happened is that
jesus and his disciples are living in an eschatological scenario and that scenario uh can be
reinterpreted so that the expectation is fulfilled in jesus or at least initially
fulfilled in jesus or prolectically fulfilled in jesus or however you want to to to to think about
that uh that's why in my judgment the passion narratives are themselves sort of little apocalypses
if you look at mark 13 talk about parallels lots of parallels between mark 13 14 15 the
sun is going to go dark people are going to run away uh and and so on so i think that this is the
early christians struggling with we have an eschatological scenario some of us were going to
die then we're going to be raised but what's happened is jesus died and he is so far the only
one to be raised until you get to matthew 27 so that's how i think about uh prophecy of again
could be wrong about this but i think it's the only reasonable uh explanation of of all the data
it's the best best thing we have when i went to carolina bible college they changed the name
to carolina college of biblical studies i think to sound more sophisticated but uh trust me it wasn't
the depth i wish uh a college i would have been able to go to um the last thing that i said i was
going to study was eschatology because it's a study of last things and so with that being said
let's go to part three it won't be too long but ladies and gentlemen check out part three here
we're ending part two and uh i really appreciate it del let's let's do that is that okay okay thank you
