Did Genesis 1-3 borrow elements from much earlier Mesopotamian mythological stories?
Brace yourself as we explore the linguistic lexical and thematic connections between these
ancient myths such as the Enuma Elish and the Genesis narrative.
But let's not overlook the implications of such borrowing.
Shouldn't this compel open-minded individuals to question the literal truth of these stories?
Before we proceed, let's address some crucial points.
The Hebrew language as recorded in the earliest texts dates back perhaps to the 10th century BCE,
while the Mesopotamian myths etched onto clay tablets are often over 1,000 years older.
Contrary to mistaken assumptions, the Hebrew Bible's creation and flood story contains
Akkadian cognates from that much earlier language, not the other way around.
It is essential to clarify this misconception and correct any misguided notions
that suggest the other myths drew inspiration from the Bible.
This factual inaccuracy needs to be rectified before we continue.
Those who attempt to use Mesopotamian myths as evidence supporting the historical truth
of the biblical narrative are quite frankly missing the boat,
or rather missing Noah's Ark altogether.
Can we genuinely believe that Utnapishtim and his wife are walking among us,
bestowed with immortality by the gods?
Do we truly entertain the notion that inlil annihilated humanity simply for being too noisy?
Or that Marduk fashioned the cosmos from the remains of the sea goddess Tiamat?
It's a resounding note to both, of course.
As someone who was a Bible fundamentalist, I understand the profound impact of blindly following
ill-informed teachings.
Today, reading these older texts and understanding their original context
has given me a richer understanding of the meaning of these stories.
I actually love these stories for what they are,
and it is my goal for others to enjoy reading them in their actual historical context,
and not as if they dropped out of heaven.
However, as we explore the intricate web of connections between these polytheistic Mesopotamian myths
and the later monotheistic Hebrew Bible,
it becomes evident that the Genesis creation and flood accounts
were crafted using popular mythological motifs of the time.
This realization raises critical questions about the historical plausibility
and the nature of scriptural inspiration.
Yes, the Bible is undoubtedly inspired,
but by these pre-existing Mesopotamian myths
that served as a foundation for its storytelling.
Join us on this intellectual journey, my friends.
Scholars agree that most of the primeval history borrows
directly or indirectly from Mesopotamian mythology,
and Genesis 1 is no exception.
While there is debate as to whether such borrowing was conscious and polemical,
or simply due to the overall influence of the myth in the ancient Near East,
the consensus is that the opening chapter of Genesis
almost certainly owes its existence to the Enuma Elish.
The Enuma Elish is an Akkadian story dating back to the mid-to-late-second millennium BCE
that tells of the god Marduk and his rise to power over the other gods.
The story begins before heaven and earth had been created.
The two water deities, Apsu and Tiamat, brought forth the gods.
Shortly after their creation, however,
they became noisy and bothersome to the god, Apsu, who decided to kill them.
Aya, however, in his wisdom was able to thwart Apsu's plans and fought back.
Aya was aware of all, discerned their stratagem,
he fashioned it, he established it, a master plan,
he made it artful, his superb magic spell,
he recited it and brought him to rest in the waters,
he put him in deep slumber, he was fast asleep, he made Apsu sleep,
he tied up Apsu, he killed him.
Having killed Apsu, Aya and his spouse Damkina take over his home
and give birth to mighty Marduk.
His body was magnificent, fiery his clans, he was a hero at birth,
he was a mighty one from the beginning.
Anu creates four winds for Marduk to play with
and with them, he disturbed Tiamat.
He caused a wave and it roiled Tiamat.
Tiamat was roiled, churning day and night,
the gods finding no rest for the brunt of each wind.
Tiamat plots to kill Marduk and the other gods.
Mother Hubor, Tiamat, who can form everything,
added countless invincible weapons, gave birth to monster serpents pointed a fang.
With merciless incisors, she filled their bodies with venom for blood.
Fear's dragons she clad with glories, causing them to bear auras like gods,
saying whoever sees them shall collapse from weakness.
Wherever their bodies make onslaught, they shall not turn back.
Her commands were absolute, no one opposed them.
Eleven indeed on this wise she created.
Her husband Kingu, she promoted to the highest position,
giving him the famous tablet of destinies, she proclaimed,
I cast your spell, I make you the greatest in the assembly of the gods.
Kingship of all the gods I put in your power.
You are the greatest in the assembly of the gods.
Kingship of all the gods I put in your power.
The great god Anshar called upon Ere to go fight Tiamat,
but his response was shocking.
Ere went to seek out Tiamat's stratagem.
He stopped, horror stricken, then turned back.
He came before Anshar the sovereign.
He beseeched him with entreaties saying,
My father, Tiamat has carried her actions beyond me.
I sought out her course, but my spell cannot counter it.
Her strength is enormous, she is utterly terrifying.
She is reinforced with a host.
None can go out against her.
Her challenge was not reduced.
It was so loud against me, I became afraid at her clamor.
I turned back.
My father do not despair, send another to her.
Anshar then went to Anu, another senior god who gave the same response.
It was only then that Marduk volunteered to take Tiamat down.
Marduk then charges to battle.
Defeats Kingu simply by approaching and ultimately kills the sea goddess,
creating the world from her carcass.
There are several possible points of contact between these two myths.
Let's begin with the very first line of the book of Genesis.
Along with John 3.16, many of us can probably at least start Genesis 1.1.
In the beginning, God created
This familiar English translation has led to some interpreters suggesting
that the first sentence in the Bible is of existential proof.
In the beginning was God.
However, the intended meaning of this first clause is not quite so simply construed
as King James had commissioned.
The Hebrew phrase that starts off the verse
can be translated at least two, if not three different ways.
And the translation is significant for reading the rest of the story.
Professor David M. Karn notes of this passage.
One of the first and most important interpretive and translation issues in this chapter
is the question of whether Genesis 1.1 is a dependent clause introducing what follows
when God created
or an independent clause in the beginning God created.
While there are other interpretive issues involved here
like should this be considered creation from nothing,
our only concern on this point is
Genesis 1.1's potential similarity to Anuma Alish.
This story opens
When the heavens above did not exist
and earth beneath had not come into being
there was Apsu, the first in order there begetter
and Demiurge Teamot, who gave birth to them all.
Notice how the first line is part of a dependent clause.
That is a clause that cannot stand alone in the sentence
and is dependent on another clause.
This is otherwise known as a temporal clause
describing a period before creation.
If Genesis 1.1 should be translated
When God began to create
or something similar
then this should describe a situation before God began to create.
The arguments are somewhat complex
and we need not go into them here.
For example, Prof. Robert D. Homstead
wrote an article in 2008 dedicated entirely
to the grammatical and syntactical features
of this first phrase in Genesis 1.1
to determine whether the verse should be translated
as a dependent or independent clause.
Basically, there are several occurrences
of this phrase in the Hebrew Bible
and they are usually translated with the word
of attached to them
in the beginning of the reign of so-and-so king.
This would mean that Genesis 1.1
would be translated something like
In the beginning of God creating the heavens and the earth
or more smoothly
when God began to create the heavens and the earth
When we continue the passage in Genesis 1.1
if understood in this way
the text is explaining
When God began to create the heavens and the earth
the earth was
In other words, this was the state of the world
when God began to create.
When we compare this to other Mesopotamian creation stories
and Enuma Elish in particular
we see something similar
Professor Joseph Blankensopp writes
Genesis 1.1 belongs to the genre of cosmogony
narratives about world origins
and ancient cosmogonic myths in that culture area
begin by describing the way it was
at the time of the first creation
only then proceeding to the creation itself
This is not only true of other ancient Near Eastern cosmogonic myths
but also in at least one other place in the Hebrew Bible
In Genesis 2.
The second creation story begins by describing
the state of the earth
before God begins his creative act
Car writes
Likewise begins with the description of the uncreated prologue
to God's creation
Genesis 1. similarly begins with a statement
of what creation was like before God created
It seems as though this narrative pattern
of describing the pre-creation state of affairs
is common not only to ancient Near Eastern compositions
but also to the Old Testament
It appears that Genesis 1 is also following this pattern
perhaps modeled after the opening line of Enuma Elish
This possibility is strengthened by the presence
of the Hebrew word to home
the deep
that is found in Genesis 1.2
Professor Ludwig Kohler and Walter Baumgartner
explained that the word to home
likely is derived from the general Semetic
Tiham
C
So as such it is not a loan word from Akkadian
both Akkadian the language of the Enuma Elish
and Hebrew the language of the Old Testament
are Semetic languages
and the word to home Hebrew and Tiamat
the name of the Akkadian sea goddess
in Enuma Elish
go back to the Semetic word Tiham
In other words this appears to be a case
in which both the Hebrew and Akkadian
are drawing on a similar source
but one may not be directly drawing from the other
This is an important point
as we want to be precise
when attempting to see connections and dependence
between texts
as we noted in a previous section
one of the ways that we determined borrowing
is the presence of shared language
between the two texts
the more unique the language that is shared
the greater the possibility of borrowing
in this instance
one might be tempted to see a direct borrowing
of Tiamat
the Akkadian sea goddess
in the word to home
but this is not necessarily the case
both words are clearly cognates
but we may not be able to say more
than that from a strictly lexical standpoint
Blankensopp agrees
the to home may be related to the same Semitic root
as the proto goddess Tiamat
representing the chaotic salt waters of the ocean
from whose body the earth was formed
what is noteworthy, however
is its place in the text
to reiterate the opening lines
in Enuma Elish are
when the heavens above did not exist
and earth beneath had not come into being
there was Apsu the first in order
there begetter
and Demiurge Tiamat
who gave birth to them all
notice that following dependent temporal clauses
we see the figure Tiamat appearing
in the first few lines
right at the beginning of the text
in Genesis 1 we read
as in Enuma Elish
the cognate word for sea
shows up in the opening lines
following a dependent temporal clause
there is more to suggest
that the to home is meant
to be connected to one degree or another
to the sea goddess Tiamat
of Enuma Elish
the word shows up in many other passages
in the Hebrew Bible
many of which used the term
all inspiring
and completely out of reach place
however
it does appear to have a more nuanced meaning
in certain texts
particularly in some of the Psalms
in Psalm 77
it appears that Yahweh is doing some sort of battle
with a personified form of
the deep
in Psalm 77 17
we read
this Psalm zeroes in on the Exodus event
but the description of the waters here
has a clearly primordial nuance
Professor Frank Lothar Haasfeld explains
the cosmological insertion
holds a unique place within the whole of the Psalm
it is true that the emphasis on the element of water
has an obvious association
with the passage through the sea
the Exodus
but here it is a matter of the mythical cosmic confrontation
between the superior god king
and the waters of chaos
concerning verse 17 specifically
he writes
in verse 17
the subterranean primeval waters
are in terror before the god manifested in theophany
here the primeval waters
are the direct opponents
it would seem that the to home
is personified in the text
as an enemy of god
that needs to be conquered
similar but not identical language
can be seen in Psalm 104
a hymn that praises Yahweh
for his power in and over his creation
in verses 6 through 7 we read
there is clear poetic imagery here
that personifies the deep
it flees and hurries away
from the power expressed by Yahweh
however there is a clear poetic imagery
that personifies the deep
it flees and hurries away
from the power expressed by Yahweh
however there is a move
away from depicting to home
directly as an enemy combatant
as seen in other passages
this in fact appears to be the same nuance
that appears in Genesis 1 verse 2
notice what professor daniel estes says about this
in any thought
the waters represented the forces of chaos
but throughout the Old Testament
they are under the control of the Lord
let's sum up and tie this back to Genesis 1 2
and to home
first passages like Psalm 77 and 104
clearly describe Yahweh
working against the primordial cosmic forces
to bring about creation
or show forth his unmatched power
professor athmar keel and sylvia shrower
discuss various passages
featuring the chaotic waters
in these creative contexts
and conclude
traces of the motif of the battle
against chaos
can be found in many Old Testament passages
the use of traces here
is at times more appropriate than others
there are certainly passages
that depict the battles
with the forces of chaos
against Yahweh
in clear straightforward language
however
in Psalm 104 and Genesis 1
I think we are seeing only traces
of the divine battle with the sea
in other words
instead of an overt description
the author of Genesis 1 seems to have gone to some lengths
to downplay the significance
of the power of the primordial sea
Blankensopp says it this way
the author of Genesis 1
a learned priest and scribe
familiar with Mesopotamian
and leventine myths of origins
has so thoroughly demythologized
the different narrative elements
of the creation story
for example
by substituting the
to home for tiamat
and by eliminating the use
of physical material in creation
mud, blood, etc
that we have to work hard
to detect the mythological
background of his account
although the priestly writer
has constructed the creation story
to downplay the mythological aspects
of the battle with chaos
and therefore rendering the primary
opponent powerless
before Yahweh
we can still see remnants
of the narrative components
still present in the text
there are obviously more points of contact
between the enuma elish
and the story in genesis 1
car notes several
including the connection between
tiamat's carcass
being used to create the dome
over the world in enuma elish
and the formation of the vault
of heaven in genesis 1
from the waters
he also draws attention
to heavenly signs
from both enuma elish and genesis 1
as well as the great sea monsters
these two may function as
blind motifs
what is more important here
however
is the fact that genesis 1
is dependent upon the enuma elish
and potentially other
ancient Near Eastern myths
that incorporate the battle
with primordial chaos
these myths clearly predate
the biblical text
and the parallels between them
and genesis 1 are arguably
too numerous and contextually
to be mere coincidence
if someone begins to read
the Old Testament for the first time
it probably won't take them
long to realize that genesis 1
1 through 2
4 sounds quite different
from genesis 2 4
to 25
if they are paying close attention
to the story
chapter 2 seems to tell the story
of creation for a second time
John J. Collins writes
whatever the origin of the
adam and eve story
it stands in sharp contrast
to the priestly account of creation
that now forms the opening
chapter of the bible
not only does the sequence
of events differ
from the first account to the second
but the writing style
is quite distinct
in this section however
we will only focus on the order
of events and how they are distinct
from and contradictory to one another
let's begin with
genesis 1
if we go through the chapter
we see the following order
of creative events
day 1 light
and god saw that the light was good
and god divided
between the light and the darkness
and god called the light
day and the darkness
he called night
genesis 1 3 to 5
day 2 the vault
sky
and god made the vault
and he divided between the waters
that are under the vault
and the waters that are above the vault
and it was so
day 3
dry land
seas and vegetation
and god said
let the waters be gathered together under the heavens
to one place
and let the dry land appear
and it was so
and god called the dry land earth
and the accumulation of waters
he called seas
and god saw that it was good
and god said
let the earth sprout vegetation
plants producing seed
fruit trees producing fruit
according to its species
whose seed is in it upon the earth
and it was so
genesis 1 9-11
day 4
sun, moon and stars
and god made the two great lights
the great light to rule the day
and the small light to rule the night
and the stars
genesis 1 16
day 5
sea creatures and birds
and god said
let the waters team with swarms of living creatures
and let birds fly over the earth
over the surface of the vault
of the heavens
genesis 1 20
day 6
land creatures and mankind
and god said
let the earth bring forth living creatures
according to their species
beast and creeping animals
and animals of the earth
according to their kind
and it was so
and god said
let us make mankind in our image
according to our likeness
and let them rule over the fish of the sea
and the birds of the heavens
and the beasts and all the earth
and all the creeping things
that creep upon the earth
and god created humanity
in his image
in the likeness of god he created them
male and female he created them
genesis 1 24
26 the 27
the narrative in genesis 2
is not as literally
structured as genesis 1
nevertheless
we can determine the sequence
in which god created and organized
event 1
man created
then the lord god formed the man with dust
from the ground
and blew into his nostrils the breath of life
and the man became
a living creature
genesis 2 7
event 2
god plants a garden
and the lord god planted a garden
and Eden in the east
and he set the man there
whom he had formed
genesis 2 8
event 3
god causes vegetation to grow
and the lord god caused
every tree that is pleasing to the eye
and good for food to sprout
from the ground
along with the tree of life in the midst
of the garden and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil
genesis 2 9
event 4
god puts man
in the garden to work
and the lord god took the man
and settled him in the garden of Eden
to work and to tend it
genesis 2 15
event 5
god creates the animals
and the lord god formed
from the ground every animal
of the field and every bird of the heavens
and he brought them to the man
to see what he would name them
and everything that the man named
each living animal
that was its name
genesis 2 19
event 6
god creates
woman
lord god made a woman from the rib
which he took from the man
and he brought her to the man
genesis 2 22
when you view
both sets of creative
and organizing events
you quickly see that they appear
rather contradictory with respect to their
order
if we set them side by side
we can compare the order
event 5
event 6
event 6
while we will not point out
every discrepancy between these two accounts
in their canonical forms
let's highlight a few
for example
when was man created
in genesis 1 26 to 27
god creates humanity
on the sixth day
the end of the creation period
furthermore
he creates man and woman
at the same time
and god created humanity
in his image
in the image of god he created them
male and female he created them
but what do we see in genesis 2
man is god's
first creation in genesis 2 7
and the lord god formed
the man with dust from the ground
and he blew into his
nostrils the breath of life
and the man became a living creature
in contrast
woman is his final creation
after the garden
vegetation and animals
and where was humanity
supposed to live
in genesis 1 28 to 29
we see god's command
and god blessed them
and god said to them
be fruitful and multiply
and fill the earth and subdue it
and rule over every fish
of the sea and over every bird
of the heavens
and over every living thing
that creeps upon the ground
and god said look
i have given you every plant
bearing seed that is upon the surface
of the earth and every tree
that has seed bearing fruit in it
is yours for food
so god commands humanity
to fill the earth
and to rule over
all the animals that were created
in contrast
we read in genesis 2
15 through 17
and the lord god took the man
and settled him in the garden of eden
to tend and guard it
and the lord god commanded the man saying
from every tree of the garden
you may certainly eat
but from the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil
you must not eat
we see that the man
and later the woman
remain in the garden until they are driven out
as a result of their disobedience
genesis 3
23
it seems as though
the story in genesis 1
commands them to go into all the world
while they are expected
to remain in the garden in genesis 2
with regards to animals
and birds and genesis 1
we see that birds were created
before the land animals
which were created before mankind
in genesis 1
20 we read
and god said
let the waters team
with swarms of living creatures
and let birds fly over the earth
over the surface of the vault of the heavens
we then see
and god said
let the earth bring forth living creatures
according to their species
beasts and creeping things
and animals of the earth after their species
and it was so
and god made the animals of the earth
according to their species
and the beasts according to their species
and every creeping thing
of the ground according to their kind
and god saw
that it was good
genesis 1
24 to 25
this all took place on day 6
before humanity had been created
however
in genesis 2 19
we read
from the ground every animal of the field
and every bird of the heavens
and he brought them to the man
to see what he would call them
and everything that the man called
each living creature
that was its name
clearly in genesis 1
the birds and land animals
are created before mankind
while in genesis 2
they are created specifically
to try and fill a specific role
for the man
again
there are many other problems
that can be discussed between these two accounts
but these will suffice
it is interesting to see how
some other scholars
have attempted to reconcile
these contradictory accounts
for example victor hamilton
argues that the creation
of animals in genesis 2
is not the first creation
of animals but the creation
of a specific
group for adam to name
that occurs after the creation
of animals in genesis 1
24 through 25
of course this seems to fly
in the face of the natural reading
of the verse
and the lord god formed from the ground
every animal of the field
and every bird of the heavens
and he brought them to the man
to see what he would name them
and everything that the man named
each living animal
genesis 2 19
in short
there appear to be contradictions
between the account of creation
given in genesis 1
1 through 2 for a
and what we see in genesis 2
for b through 25
we have focused on the
contradictions and inconsistencies
in the sequence of events
that are given in the creation accounts
although this is but the tip
of the iceberg however
our goal here
is only to provide a specific
contradiction that can be
supported well by the data
the story of the garden of eden
adam and eve and the snake
has had a wide reaching influence
on western culture throughout the last two millennia
but
where does this story come from
is the eden narrative
simply lifted from
an ancient mesopotamian myth
a completely independent
work or perhaps
something in between
in this section we will provide
a brief glimpse into some of the more
common parts of the story
that can be connected to earlier
ancient Near Eastern myths
and traditions to see how the story
of adam and eve relates to earlier texts
while there are a number
of aspects in the story
that we could investigate at great
length I will try to
focus on those portions that find
greater overall agreement among scholars
in the field concerning their intertextual
relationships with older
mythology
we will begin with the creation
of man particularly
with respect to how he was created
his initial state
and his initial purpose in the garden
we will turn then to eve
considering the order
and method of her creation
finally our attention will turn to the theme
of the lost chance at immortality
that can be seen in the tree of life
I need to make something clear from the
outset the garden of eden
story does not appear to
recreate any
one mythological text
from the ancient Near East
in other words there does not appear
to be another
adam and eve story
where a Mesopotamian
man and woman are created by the gods
and they live in and are expelled
from a garden because of disobedience
to the gods or the like
we can contrast this
to the story of the flood
in Genesis 6 through 9
which finds another clear parallel
in the story of Atrahasis
and Tablet 11
of the epic of Gilgamesh
what appears in Genesis 2 through 3
is most likely
a newly formed myth
not directly patterned on a previous
story
however
that does not mean that it does not
also draw on common themes
and motifs and perhaps
even particular myths
from the ancient Near East
notice what
Kar writes
though Genesis 2 to 3 does not
represent a reformulation
of any one of these texts
it features a similar
combination of anthropogonic
and mortality themes
as that was seen in the epic of
Gilgamesh
moreover the Mesopotamian
cosmogonic tradition
drawn upon in Gilgamesh
seems to be part of a broader
literary world
in light of which certain features
of Genesis 2 to 3
have particular significance
including the formation
of the first human from clay
earth his destiny
to work the ground
the focus on divine wisdom
human sexuality
and the lost chance at immortality for humans
the human distinction
from animals by virtue of wearing
clothing and human
multiplication
I will argue that the author of Genesis 2 through 3
borrowed directly or indirectly
from earlier ancient Near Eastern
mythologies as evidenced
by the close similarities
and the textual and or cultural
availability of these themes
and motifs to the writer
a final opening word before
we look at the specifics
as we argued in the previous section
both Genesis 1
and Genesis 2 through 3
appear to open their creation accounts
by describing the state of affairs
before the creative process began
Genesis 2
4b through 7
reads
when Yahweh God made the earth
and the heavens before any plant
of the field existed in the earth
and before any herb
of the field had sprouted
because Yahweh God had not
sent rain upon the earth nor was
there a man to work the ground
but a stream went up from the earth
and watered the entire face of the ground
Yahweh God
formed the man out of the soil
of the ground and he breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life
and the man became
a living being
Genesis 2 4b to 7
this type of
pre-creation introduction
is incredibly common in Mesopotamian
literature both
in Sumerian and Akkadian texts
for example
in the Sumerian composition
Gilgamesh, Inkidu
and the Netherworld
in those days
in those distant days
in those nights
in those remote nights
in those years
in those distant years
in days of yore when the necessary things
have been brought into manifest existence
in days of yore when the necessary things
have been for the first time
properly cared for
when bread had been tasted
for the first time in the shrines of the land
when the ovens of the land
had been made to work
when the heavens had been separated
from the earth
when the earth had been delimited from the heavens
when the fame of mankind
had been established
when An had taken the heavens for himself
when Enlil
had taken earth for himself
when the Netherworld had been
given to a reshkigol as a gift
another example of this
can be seen in a bilingual Sumerian
Akkadian incantation
from the mid first millennium BCE
the text opens
a pure house
a house of the gods had not yet been built
in a pure place
a reed had not yet come out
a tree had not yet been created
a brick not yet laid
a brick not yet made
a house not built
a city not built
a city not built
a city not built
animals not existing
nipple not yet built
the acor not built
uruk not built
the aiana not yet built
the opsu not built
eridu not built
the pure house
the house of the gods
their residence had not yet been built
all the countries were still a sea
as you can see
texts and many others
contain creation themes
in which the pre-existing state
of reality is described
setting the stage for the creative act
this can be seen in genesis 2
through 3
following a similar description
of the state of the preformed world
yahwe creates the man
from the soil of the ground
animating him
with divine breath
this process
of forming humans from
earthen materials is well known
from mesopotamian sources
for example
in the story of inki and ninma
the story opens
in the now all too familiar way
in those days
in the days when heaven and earth
were created
in those nights
in the nights when heaven and earth were created
a few lines later
we see that the burden
of providing for the senior gods
is laid on the lesser deities
the senior gods
oversaw the work
while the minor gods were bearing the toil
the gods were digging
the canals and piling up the silt
in harali
the gods, crushing the clay
began complaining
about this life
inki is then encouraged
to create beings that can shoulder
the work for the minor deities
inki says to his mother
my mother
the creature you planned
will really come into existence
impose on him the work
of carrying baskets
you should need clay
from the top of the abzu
the birth goddesses
will nip off the clay
and you shall bring the form into existence
another sumerian text
that speaks of both heaven and earth
and the creation of mankind
from the earth
is the song of the hoe
the farming instrument
to be clear
the text begins
and lil
who will make the human seed
come forth from the earth
and not only did he hasten
to separate heaven from earth
and hasten to separate earth from heaven
but
in order to make it possible
for humans to grow in
where flesh came forth
he first suspended
the axis of the world
at doran ki
concerning these lines
gertrid farber
writes
the creation of man
is described
by which the hoe strokes clay
into a human like form
and then digs up the earth
from which men sprout
like plants
this is quite similar to the more popular
akkadian story of atrahasis
which opens in this way
when gods were man
then the creation of man
is described
by which the hoe strokes clay
when gods were man
they did forced labor
they bore drudgery
the lesser gods eventually took up arms
and rebelled against their divine overlords
and inki is again commissioned
to create a human to bear the burden
of manual labor
the text reads as follows
enki made ready to speak
and said to the great gods
on the first
seventh and fifteenth
days of the month
i will establish a purification
a bath
let one god be slaughtered
then let the gods be purified
in it
let nin too mix clay with his
flesh and blood
let that same god and man be
thoroughly mixed in the clay
let us hear the drumbeat
for the rest of time
from the flesh of the god
let a spirit remain
both the theme of the creation
of mankind from some earthen
substance and his purpose
to serve the gods are present
at least two of these texts
in atrahasis a divine
substance is introduced into the
clay in order to bring about
the final human form
as we see in genesis two through three
notice however
that the burdensome
aspect of the work the human
is to perform is not
present in the eden narrative
yawe creates the man
and places him in the garden
to care for and protect
it genesis two fifteen
but this work is
not cast in a negative light
conversely in both
enki and ninma
and atrahasis the gods
are being relieved of their incredibly
burdensome duties
as this work is foisted
upon the shoulders of newly
formed humanity
as doctor john j collins notes
in the atrahasis
story humanity was created
to do agricultural work
for the gods
in genesis the first human
being is also charged with
keeping the garden of god
but the task does not appear
to be onaris
this may suggest
a type of inversion of the
massivitamian tradition on the part of the
writer of genesis two through three
one of the aspects
of the eden narrative that scholars
focus on is the similarities
between life before
eve and the purpose
and method of her creation
and themes and myths from the ancient
near east
in the epic of gilgamesh
inki do the companion
of gilgamesh was created
and lived in the wild
among the animals
however
shamha a prostitute
from the city of aruk
came and copulated
with inki do
which resulted in him losing
his kinship
with the animals
and becoming a civilized human
he is clothed
eats bread
drinks beer
and goes to live in the city of aruk
as you recall
from earlier in this video series
this progression
from innocence
to becoming civilized
is a positive movement
people who live in the mountains
eat raw meat
and do not know what it is like
to dwell in cities are backward
and displeasing
to the gods in general
massivitamian thought
a good example of this can be seen
in the sumerian debate poem
the debate between sheep
and grain
the opening of the composition
surprise surprise
contains a dependent clause
and speaks of conditions
prior to the creative act
when upon the hill
of heaven and earth
on spawned the anunagods
the story continues
the people of those days
did not know about
eating bread
they did not know about wearing clothes
they went about with naked limbs
in the land
like sheep they ate grass with their mouths
and drank water from the ditches
when we view
the eden narrative
we see a similar movement
ultimately from innocence to civilized
adam is created
and initially interacts with
the animal kingdom
specifically to find a partner
that is good fit for him
however
finding no such match
Yahweh resorts to
creating his partner
the man's own ribs
eventually following
their disobedience in the garden
they are clothed
gain wisdom and understanding
and are brought out of their
state of innocence
and into a type of maturity
the difference however is
that this movement is not positive
it is only through disobedience
that they become civilized
the text paints this progression
towards civilization
in a negative light
although the man is not to be
associated with the animal kingdom
he retains his status
as innocent and childlike
which appears to be a
perhaps subtle inversion
of mesopotamian thought
the method of eve's creation
is another potential point of contact
between the biblical text
and the ancient near eastern mythology
the word used to describe
how Yahweh created
with the rib
the text reads
and Yahweh God created
a woman with the rib he had taken
from the man
and he brought her to the man
the word translated
created in this verse
is the Hebrew verb
banah
which usually means to build
normally the verbs for creating
used in genesis 1
and 2 through 3
are yatsar to form
asa to make
or bara to create
is the use of banah
to build
of any significance here
the verb banu in Akkadian
the cognate of
banach in Hebrew
is used in context
of creation
for example in the epic of Gilgamesh
when the gods decide to create a companion
for Gilgamesh
we see the following scene
they summoned aruru
the great one
you aruru created
literally built
the human race
now create what anu commanded
to his Gilgamesh's
stormy heart
let that one be equal
let them contend with each other
that oruk may have peace
when aruru heard this
she conceived within her
banu commanded
aruru wet her hands
she pinched off clay
she cast it down upon the step
she created
built valiant
enkidu in the step
we see something quite similar
in enuma alish
when marduk heard the god's speech
he conceived a desire to
accomplish clever things
he opened his mouth addressing aya
he counsels that
which he had pondered in his heart
i will bring together
blood and form bone
i will bring into being
lulu whose name shall be
man
i will create build
luluman on whom
the toil of the gods will be laid
that they may rest
even atrahasis
contains this verb in a similar
context
let the mother goddess create
build
a human being
let man assume the drudgery
of god
it would seem that this use of
to build in the context
of mesopotamian creation accounts
is rather common
but carries a somewhat nuanced meaning
conversely
it is anything but common
in the heber bible
even evangelical professor
gordon winhem observes
only here and in amus 9.6
is this verb used
of god's creative activity
though in akkadian enuguritic
it is the regular
term for creation
thus the combination
of the common use of the verb
to build in other ancient
near eastern creation stories
coupled with its rare usage
in the old testament
suggests that this is an echo
of the mesopotamian tradition
as you can see
although there are no
known mythological traditions
to which the garden of eden
story directly corresponds
there are many connections
that can be seen between
the eden narrative and ancient
near eastern mythologies
let's look at one last connection
in the story of the garden
there is another point
of connection between
the mesopotamian traditions
and the eden narrative
the theme of loss
at the chance of immortality
as in the previous sections
we will not be able to cover
all known occurrences of this theme
in ancient near eastern literature
but there are some well known myths
that are often compared
to the biblical story
the two stories that show up most frequently
are the epic of Gilgamesh
along with the less well known
Adapa and the south wind
in each story
the protagonist is within arms reach
of a form of immortality
only to lose it
either through deception
or theft
beginning with the epic of Gilgamesh
in tablet 11
Gilgamesh finally makes his way
to Utnapishtim
the survivor of the worldwide flood
as Utnapishtim
has become immortal
Gilgamesh hopes to learn the secret
to eternal life
Utnapishtim then recounts
in full his dramatic story
of the flood
and how the gods granted him
and his wife eternal life
but placed them far away
separated from humanity
at the mouth of the rivers
then comes the kicker
at least
for Gilgamesh
now then
who will convene the gods for your sake
that you may find eternal life
you seek
a perfect storm of events
forgive the pun
had led to Utnapishtim
being granted eternal life
how would Gilgamesh convene the gods
to have them agreed to do the same for him
he couldn't
however
as a type of consolation prize
Utnapishtim agrees to tell him
about a secret plant
that grows under the water
which will rejuvenate the one
that consumes it
hooray
off goes Gilgamesh
tying rocks to his feet that drag him down
under the water
where he finds the plant
now you might expect to see him consuming the plant
the moment his head clears the water
but no
we'll tell him
to urshinabi
the boat man
or shinabi
this plant is a cure for heartache
whereby a man can regain his vitality
i will take it to ramparded
uruk
i will have an old man
eat some
and so test the plant
you can probably guess what happens
on his journey back to his home city

the
Mesopotamian story known as the adapa in the south wind also contains a story in which the main
character has a shot at immortality but misses the opportunity the myth has both Sumerian and
Akkadian versions its composition goes back at least to the early second millennium bce but was
copied well into the first millennium bc the story tells of adapa a wise man who serves the god of
aia who has bestowed upon him this wisdom adapa takes it upon himself to prepare the offerings
for aia each day which includes fish while on the water one day fishing for these offerings the
south wind blows hard and capsizes adapa's boat after struggling in the water all that day adapa
angrily curses the south wind because aia has granted adapa magical powers the wing of the south
wind is broken and the wind does not blow for seven days this eventually comes to the attention
of anu in heaven who learns of adapa's actions and summons him to heaven aia advises adapa to be
wary of what anu might do when you come before anu if they proffer you food of death do not eat
if they proffer you water of death do not drink if they proffer you a garment put it on
if they proffer you oil anoint yourself aia warns that if anu gives him food and drink it will be the
food and drink of death as it turns out this is not true the food and drink would have bestowed upon
adapa eternal life notice anu's words why did aia disclose to a human being something bad of heaven
and earth the ability to do this kind of magic and give him such a stout heart since he aia has so
treated him adapa what for our part shall we do for him bring him food of life let him eat
they brought him food of life he did not eat they brought him water of life he did not drink
anu stared and burst out laughing at him come now adapa why did you not eat and drink won't you live
alas for the wretched peoples leaving aside why aia might have tricked adapa into passing up
the chance at immortality the salient point for our purposes is that adapa had a shot at eternal life
but was tricked into passing it up if you're interested in a critical examination on why inki
aia and yahue would lie to adapa in the mesopotamian story and adam in the biblical one
the description will have the video just for you with these stories in our minds
let's turn back to the eden narrative yahue commands the man and the woman not to partake of
the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when they eat they gain a certain level
of knowledge and understanding becoming more civilized and this leads to a new circumstance for
yahue to deal with and yahue god said the man has now become like one of us knowing good and evil
and now lest he stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever
so yahue god sent him out from the garden of eden to work the ground from which he had been taken
and he drove out the man and he stationed on the east side of the garden of eden cherubim
and a flaming sword that rotates to guard the path of the tree of life genesis 3 22 to 24
another missed opportunity here the man and the woman have gained wisdom and understanding
but this has resulted in them being cut off from the tree of life which had been within reach
if only for a brief period of time what we see in the tree of life is likely quite similar in
function to the plant that gilgamesh found in the sea it rejuvenated the individual to their youth
by cutting off access to the tree yahue was ensuring that they would not be able to partake
of the tree of youth and would not be able to extend their lives through rejuvenation
professor joseph blinkensopp writes analogy between this plant of gilgamesh and the tree of life
the fruit of which grants immunity from death suggests that the proto parents had not eaten
its fruit because being still young they did not yet need rejuvenation when taken together the theme
of the loss at the chance of immortality is clear in each of these stories given the presence of
other points of comparison between these earlier myths and the story of adam and eve the fact that
there was a snake that was instrumental in the loss of access to the life-giving plant in the
epoch of gilgamesh as well as in the eden narrative the biblical story here is quite likely dependent
on the mesopotamian traditions again i owe a huge thanks to dr joshua bowen who is an expert in a
syriology and hebrew bible studies for his invaluable insights into the intricate details
you watched in this video the man is a linguistic genius again fluent in sumerian akkadian aramaic
hebrew he is a book on how to read sumerian and more and he's up to date with the latest
scholarship in the field his book the atheist handbook to the old testament is an absolute
gold mine of information on this subject and much more if you're serious about diving deeper you
can find it on audible or grab a hardback copy the link is also in the description we trust you
found the examination of how the biblical author skillfully repurposed earlier mythologies to craft
their own unique narratives of creation and the great flood to be a fascinating endeavor has this
revelation peaked your curiosity about delving further into the earlier mesopotamian stories
that influenced these biblical authors we could probably do a series just discussing the ancient
mesopotamian myths and their stories for everyone to learn because i'm an honest believer that if
you do not know those stories that way predate the bible you really don't get the background
and the tradition that eventually birthed what we see and call the bible we eagerly
