From the beginning, his mother knew that he was no ordinary person.
Prior to his birth, a heavenly figure appeared to her, announcing that her son would not
be a mere mortal, but would himself be divine.
This prophecy was confirmed by the miraculous character of his birth, a birth accompanied
by supernatural signs.
The boy was already recognized as a spiritual authority in his youth.
His discussions with recognized experts showed his superior knowledge of all things religious.
As an adult, he left home to engage in an itinerant preaching ministry.
He went from village to town with his message of good news, proclaiming that people should
forego their concerns for the material things of this life, such as how they should dress
and what they should eat.
They should instead be concerned with their eternal souls.
He gathered around him a number of disciples who were amazed by his teaching and his flawless
character.
They became convinced that he was no ordinary man, but was the son of God.
Their faith received striking confirmation in the miraculous things that he did.
He could reportedly predict the future, heal the sick, cast out demons, and raise the dead.
Not everyone proved friendly, however.
At the end of his life, his enemies trumped up charges against him, and he was placed
on trial before Roman authorities for crimes against the state.
Even after he departed this realm, however, he did not forsake his devoted followers.
Some claimed that he had ascended bodily into heaven.
Others said he had appeared to them alive afterward, that they had talked with him and
touched him, and become convinced that he could not be bound by death.
A number of his followers spread the good news about this man, recounting what they had
seen him say and do.
Eventually, some of these accounts came to be written down in books that circulated throughout
the empire.
This holy man lived in the first century CE.
But I doubt that you have ever read them.
In fact, I suspect you have never heard the name of this miracle-working Son of God.
The man I have been referring to is the great Neo-Pythagorean teacher and pagan Apollonius
of Tyanna, a worshipper of the Roman gods, whose life and teachings are still available
for us in the writings of his later third century follower, Philo Stratus, in his book
The Life of Apollonius.
Apollonius lived at about the same time of Jesus, even though they never met.
The reports about their lives were in many ways similar.
At a later time, Jesus' followers argued that Jesus was the miracle-working Son of God,
and that Apollonius was an imposter, a magician, and a fraud.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Apollonius' followers made just the opposite claim, asserting that
he was the miracle-working Son of God, and that Jesus was a fraud.
The New Testament, a historical introduction to early Christian writings, by Bart D. Ehrman,
page 19 through 21, Daemons, Demons, and Greco-Roman Antiquity.
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, what is this, a
new teaching?
With authority, he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
Thanks to the wonderful work by Dr. Wendy Cotter, Miracles and Greco-Roman Antiquity,
a source book for the study of New Testament miracle stories, we will help you explore
the times around the rise of the movement called Christianity, with its hero God, Jesus,
doing very much the same things that were already in the air in the world around the
century.
Whether one is looking at miraculous healings as our last documentary shows, several gods
and heroes before, during, and after the time of Jesus, from the Greco-Roman world, healing
the blind, deaf, crippled, and raising the dead, just like Jesus.
Or if you're interested in the strange narratives of casting out demons, this series is giving
you primary sources from ancient authors who share the beliefs of people in this period.
My goal isn't to falsify a narrative from the New Testament, rather my goal is to level
the playing field by bringing Christianity down to the world from which it was birthed.
Apologetics often wants to insulate the New Testament from any non-Jewish sources, and
this is becoming a stumbling block for an accurate assessment of the materials.
Jesus wasn't the only healer, nor was he the only guy running around supposedly casting
out demons.
Many would like to ignore those other sources, or hand-wave the claims from other sources.
Myth-Vision is like your modern-day Lucian of Samasara.
We try to bring humor, critical thinking, and skepticism as we engage in much of what is
considered superstitions, by evaluating whether these claims are purely literary, serving
a story or narrative function.
Was there really an itinerant preacher named Jesus or Apollonius running around like a
shaman casting out demons?
Or is there a bit of both happening?
We will ultimately never know with absolute certainty, but let us begin our exploration.
Diving into the world of exorcisms is a bit like stepping into a magic circle where your
perspective shapes what you see.
Harold Remus in his exploration of second-century miracle squabbles between pagans and Christians
points out that what you make of Jesus' exorcism gigs could range from witnessing
divine rescue operations to suspecting dark arts or even outright fraud.
It all boils down to whose glasses you're looking through.
Consider an exorcism approved by the critics as the real deal in a bona fide act of heroism.
The story can take on different shades depending on the cosmic scenery the narrator has pointed
for us.
Let's say the backdrop is apocalyptic, like the ultimate showdown between good and evil
is just around the corner.
In this scenario, an exorcism by Jesus gets the blockbuster treatment, heralding the curtain
call for Satan's reign of earthly terror.
But strip away those apocalyptic vibes and you're left with a Jesus exorcism that blends
into the everyday supernatural hustle and bustle of the Greco-Roman world.
To really get a grip on the spectrum of meanings an exorcism can conjure, you've got to be
acquainted with the local demonology.
Be it the garden variety Greco-Roman spooks or the heavyweight contenders from Jewish
apocalyptic thrillers in the day and age of the rise of the New Testament literature.
Each brings its own flavor to the exorcism tale, seasoning our understanding of what's
at stake when spirits get booted out.
Simply put, there are several accounts of exorcisms from other figures before, during,
and after the time of the stories of Jesus.
It was in the air during this time in history.
Truth be told, this idea of exorcisms spans back all the way into ancient Mesopotamia
with Sumerian demons being expelled at the name of their wise sage, Adapa.
But this video isn't giving the long history of demons, rather sources showing that Jesus
was among many other figures who supposedly had the power to exorcise demons.
So are these exorcists worthy of our worship now that they can perform miracles and cast
out demons?
Of course not.
These sources are for sure literary works and at best claims of what these figures did.
They are claims which are just as plausible as the Jesus claims.
In my book, extremely unlikely and more legendary.
But when someone tries to put the New Testament claims above these others, they are forced
to have to special plead for Jesus and downplay these other figures.
I cannot disprove these things never happened.
But we can have extremely high confidence that we are dealing with crafted stories with
a literary thrust which looks more crafted than actual history.
How do we sweep away the legend and literary nature of these stories to find Bedrock?
What if these stories have no historical foundation but are just that?
Well crafted stories about Jesus decades after the guy is off the scene.
Was Jesus even an exorcist?
Possibly yes.
But he wouldn't have been the only one.
We have several in the historical record.
Imagine how many exorcists were running around who never made it into the history books.
What if one of these exorcists were the true Son of God and we got the wrong guy to worship?
Deusing, of course.
The nature and identity of daemons in non-Jewish sources of Greco-Roman antiquity.
Frederick E. Brink, SJ, takes us on a moonlit journey through the pages of demonology from
the dawn of folklore to the 3rd century CE in his captivating study in The Light of
the Moon, Demonology in the Early Imperial Period.
His exploration uncovers the rich picture of beliefs surrounding the enigmatic daemon.
Revealing a term so versatile, pinning it down to a single meaning would be a fool's
errand.
Context Brink convincingly argues is king when it comes to understanding what a daemon
signifies in any given narrative.
The plot thickens with Plutarch, a luminary of the 1st and 2nd centuries, 45 to 125 CE,
who credits Hesiod withdrawing the celestial line of scrimmage, separating the daemons
from the gods and assigning them a lifespan that would make any tortoise green with envy.
9,720 years, to be exact.
But this demarcation is just the beginning.
The term daemon flits about donning a plethora of roles that could dizzy even the most seasoned
mythologists.
At its most encompassing, spirit seems to be the word that best captures the essence
of these beings.
These spirits can be anything from divine messengers, cosmic middlemen, if you will,
to rebellious forces at odds with the gods.
They might guard humans like celestial bodyguards, or haunt them like spiteful specters.
Some are akin to cheerfully departed souls, while others are more in the vein of bitter
ghosts, harboring a grudge against the living.
In the end, Brink's essay illuminates the complex and shifting landscape of ancient
beliefs about the supernatural, where daemons play a role as varied and vibrant as life
itself.
Plutarch, circa 50 to 120 CE.
Plutarch, a towering intellectual figure of the early 2nd century CE, offers a treasure
trove of insights into the spiritual and philosophical beliefs that permeated the Mediterranean
world during the Roman Empire.
His work spans a rich array of subjects, but it's in de-fectu oracleorum on the decline
of oracles, found within the pages of 415a-418d, that we encounter a particularly intriguing
discourse on the fading voices of the ancient oracles, a phenomenon that puzzled many of
his contemporaries.
This narrative unfolds in an evocative setting, a group of erudite friends gathering in the
baths at the temple, perhaps enveloped in steam and the echoes of philosophical debate.
It's here, amidst the backdrop of Delphi, once the epicenter of divine prophecy, that
they ponder the silence that has befallen the oracles, which in bygone eras served as
channels for the gods voices to the mortal world.
Intercliumbrotus of Sparta.
Not merely a man of wealth, but a voracious seeker of wisdom, with a passport stamped
by the known world, it is he who steps into the conversation with a perspective shaped
by his extensive travels and unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
Its contributions to the dialogue reflect a broader examination of the spiritual mechanics
behind the oracles' silence, inviting readers into a contemplation of divine presence and
absence in a changing world.
Plutarch references to daemons, particularly in his Moralia 350e, and the exploration of
their possession effects in his lives, specifically in the story of Marcellus 20.5f.
Through these writings, Plutarch not only documents the beliefs of his time, but also
engages deeply with them, offering a window into the complex interplay between humanity
and the divine, the seen and the unseen, in the vast world of imperial Mediterranean culture.
Let's dive into what Plutarch writes pertaining to this philosophical discussion, acting
like flies on the wall listening in.
Many perplexities are explained by the teaching that a race of demigods exists between the
gods and humanity.
Plutarch, they put the case well who say that Plato, by his discovery of the element underlying
all created qualities, which is now called matter and nature, has relieved philosophers
of many perplexities.
But as it seems to me, those persons have resolved more and greater perplexities who have set
the race of demigods midway between gods and men, and have discovered a force to draw
together, in a way, and to unite our common fellowship.
Whether this doctrine comes from the wise men of the cult of Zoroaster, or whether it
is Thracian and harks back to Orpheus, or is Egyptian or Phrygian, as we may infer from
observing that many things connected with death and mourning in the rites of both lands
are combined in the ceremonies so fervently celebrated there.
Heroes who die can become demigods and demigods heroes.
Plutarch, among the Greeks, Homer moreover, appears to use both names in common, and sometimes
to speak of the gods as demigods, dimoners.
But Hesiod was the first to set forth clearly and distinctly four classes of rational beings.
Gods demigods, heroes in this order, and last of all, men.
And as a sequence to this, apparently, he postulates his transmutation, the golden race
passing selectively into many good divinities, and the demigods, into heroes.
Others postulate a transmutation for bodies and souls alike, in the same manner in which
water is seen to be generated from earth, air from water, and fire from air, as their
substance is born upward.
Even so, from men into heroes and from heroes into demigods, the better souls obtain their
transmutation, but from the demigods, a few souls still, in the long reach of time because
of supreme excellence, come, after being purified, to share completely in divine qualities.
If souls lose control of themselves, they can again be clothed with earthly bodies.
Plutarch, but with some of these souls it comes to pass that they do not maintain control
over themselves, but yield to temptation, and are again clothed with mortal bodies,
and have a dim and darkened life, like mist or vapor.
The Lobe Edition supplies a note on Hesiod's calculation that a demigod lives 9,720 years,
and a discussion of how to interpret one generation, resistance to the stoic theory of conflagration.
It is impossible to imagine the cosmos without the daemons.
Plutarch, now if the air that is between the earth and the moon were to be removed and
withdrawn, the unity and consociation of the universe would be destroyed, since there would
be an empty and unconnected space in the middle, and in just the same way, those who refuse
to leave us the race of demigods make the relations of gods and men remoto and alien
by doing away with the interpretative and ministering nature, as Plato has called it,
or else they force a use to a disorderly confession of all things, in which we bring
the god into men's emotions and activities, drawing him down to our needs as the women
of Thessaly are said to draw down the moon.
Just as with human beings, so too among the demigods, there are different degrees of excellence.
Plutarch, for as among men, so also among the demigods, there are different degrees
of excellence, and in some there is a weak and dim remainder of the emotional and irrational,
a survival, as it were, while in others this is excessive and hard to stifle.
Of these things, there are in many places sacrifices, ceremonies and legends which preserve
and jealously guard vestiges and tokens embodied here and there in their fabric.
The gloomy practices on festival days are meant to ward off evil spirits.
Plutarch, as for festivals and sacrifices, which may be compared with ill-oamened and
gloomy days, in which occur the eating of raw flesh, rending of victims, fasting and
beating of breasts, and again in many places scurrilous language at the shrines frenzy
and shoutings of throngs in excitement with tumultuous tossings of heads in the air.
I should say that these acts are not performed for any god, but are soothing and appeasing
rites for the averting of evil spirits.
A possessed man, demons affect the signs of madness, such as shrieking, running and nakedness.
Plutarch, just as they were ready to arrest him, Nisius, an assembly of the citizens was
held and here Nisius, right in the midst of some advice that he was giving to the people,
suddenly threw himself upon the ground, and after a little while, amid the silence and
consternation which naturally prevailed, lifted his head, turned it about, and spoke
in a low and trembling voice, little by little, raising and sharpening its tones.
And when he saw the whole audience struck dumb with horror, he tore off his mantle,
rent his tunic, and leaping up half naked, ran towards the exit from the theatre, crying
out that he was pursued by the mothers.
No man venturing to lay hands upon him, or even to come in his way, out of superstitious
fear, but all avoiding him, he ran out to the gate of the city, freely using all the
cries and gestures that would become a man possessed and crazed.
Apolaeus of Medara, 123-190 CE
Apolaeus of Medara, a figure of considerable intellect and creativity, navigated a world
where the boundaries between philosophy, poetry, and the supernatural frequently blurred.
His life took a dramatic turn in 161 CE when he was elevated to the esteemed position of
chief priest in the province of Carthage, a role that underscored his prominence in
the religious and intellectual circles of his time.
However, this ascent came after a period of significant personal turmoil.
Just six years before his appointment, Apolaeus found himself entangled in a legal drama that
could well have been lifted from one of his own works.
He was accused of employing magic, a serious charge in the Roman world, with the aim of
winning the affection in hand of a wealthy widow.
The implications of such accusations went far beyond personal scandal.
They threatened his freedom, his reputation, and his very life.
In response to these charges, Apolaeus crafted a defense that not only showcased his eloquence
and wit, but also his deep understanding of philosophy, law, and the natural world.
His speech preserved as the Apologiae, also known as Pro Sede Magia, or Discourse on
Magic, offers a fascinating glimpse into the inner play of magic, society, and personal
integrity in the 2nd century CE.
The following passage is taken from Apolaeus' Apologiae on the matter.
All divination and miracles of magicians are controlled by demons.
Apolaeus of Medora, Apologiae 439.
I believe Plato when he asserts that there are certain divine powers holding a position
and possessing a character midway between gods and men, and that all divination and the
miracles of magicians are controlled by them.
Celsus, Origins Contra Celsum, 177-180 CE.
It is sorcerers who deal with demons, blow away diseases, and invoke the souls of the
heroes only for base gain.
Celsus, Origen, Contra Celsum.
Celsus puts them, the Jesus Miracles, on a level with the works of sorcerers who profess
to do wonderful miracles, and the accomplishments of those who are taught by the Egyptians,
who for a few obols make known their sacred law in the middle of the marketplace and drive
demons out of men and blow away diseases and invoke the souls of heroes.
Celsus, the 2nd century critic of Christianity, famously equated the miracles performed by
Jesus with the acts of sorcerers and magicians.
As recorded in polemical text against early Christian claims, his critique illuminates
a broader cultural skepticism towards supernatural interventions, especially those performed by
figures outside the established religious and social norms of the Roman Empire.
By placing Jesus's miracles alongside the feats of sorcerers and the esoteric practices
of Egyptian magicians, Celsus not only challenges the uniqueness and divinity of these miracles,
but also embeds them with a wider context of magical practices prevalent in the ancient world.
It would be wonderful if we had earlier sources of critics like Celsus to Christianity.
I guess one could put Lucian in that category, but it's very interesting to see Celsus jabbing
at the claims of Christians by paving the well-worn path of Greco-Roman tradition,
which was before Christians came along with their hero, Jesus.
We should ask ourselves questions like, is Celsus accurate in his criticisms of Christianity?
Are we just following the winners of history, meaning church history and their perception
instead of listening to the critics of a superstition that recently rose in history,
which co-ops the very same mythical and magical tropes already established in the Greco-Roman
world? The term sorcerer serves as a powerful, pejorative, conjuring images of deceit and
manipulation and is strategically used by Celsus to undermine the legitimacy of the exorcist's
work. The choice of language reflects a common rhetorical tactic, framing the unfamiliar,
or foreign, as a source of dubious knowledge or practices. In this case, attributing the
origins of black magic to Egyptians, this not only serves to exoticize and otherwise these
practices, but also implies a corruption of Roman virtues through the influence of foreign,
suspicious healers. Celsus' critique extends beyond mere association with sorcery. He condemns
the commercialization of sacred acts, accusing practitioners of profaning spiritual matters
for personal gain. This accusation taps into a broader concern about the integrity of religious
and spiritual leaders, suggesting that the commodification of divine interventions
undermines their authenticity and sanctity. Practically, he sees these Christians as ancient
biny hens selling their spiritual matters. Furthermore, Celsus is grouping of various
supernatural activities, exercising demons, curing diseases through spells, and invoking
the spirits of heroes under a single umbrella of critique highlights the fluidity between
different forms of ancient supernatural practices. This amalgamation serves to diminish the perceived
sanctity of these acts, equating them with necromancy and other forms of dark magic. It underscores
the skepticism towards the mingling of disease, demonic possession, and sacred divination,
suggesting a pervasive intertwining of health, spirituality, and the supernatural in ancient
thought. Funny thing about this is, the same criticisms towards the Christians is reversed
towards the Greek and Roman gods and heroes. Celsus' arguments provide a window into the
complex landscape of ancient religious and magical practice or beliefs, where the boundaries between
divinity, magic, and charlatanism were often contested. His critique reflects broader debates
about the nature of spiritual authority, the legitimacy of supernatural interventions,
and the ethical implications of monetizing sacred knowledge.
Let's turn now to Lucian of Samosata. Lucian of Samosata, 120 to 190 CE.
Lucian of Samosata, a master satirist whose pen was as sharp as his wit, remains one of the most
intriguing figures of classical antiquity. Born in the eastern reaches of the Roman Empire,
Lucian's works often reflect the cultural and religious diversity of his homeland,
offering a unique perspective on the complexities of life in Syria and the broader Near East.
He would be in a position to know what the common folk of these regions practiced and believed.
One of Lucian's notable contributions to literature is the Lover of Lies, a work that
gleefully dives into the world of the supernatural, the miraculous, and the downright unbelievable.
Through this text, Lucian not only entertains but also critiques the gullibility and superstition
he perceives around him. His skepticism towards the miraculous is embodied in the character of
Aion, who chastises another character for doubting the existence of the supernatural,
specifically referring to a Syrian exorcist's ability to cast out daemons. This narrative
choice is particularly fascinating as it provides a window into the cultural interactions and
tensions of Lucian's time. The reference to a Syrian exorcist is significant, highlighting
the cross-cultural beliefs in spirits and their exorcism that were prevalent across the Roman
Empire. Lucian's satirical lens does not spare these beliefs, instead he uses them as a vehicle
to explore themes of truth, belief, and the human penchant for embracing the fantastical.
Lucian's work stands as a testament to the enduring power of satire to challenge societal
norms and beliefs. Through the Lover of Lies, he invites his readers to question the nature of
truth and the foundations of their convictions, all while navigating the cultural and religious
practices that defined the ancient Mediterranean world. These sources throughout this documentary
are windows into the ancient world. It is ridiculous to doubt everything. What about those who free
the daemon possessed from their terrors? Lucian, the Lover of Lies, you act ridiculously, said Aion,
to doubt everything. For my part, I should like to ask you what you say to those who free possessed
men from their terrors by exercising the spirit so manifestly. I need not discuss this. Everyone
knows about the Syrian from Palestine, the adept in it, how many he takes in hand who fall down
in the light of the moon and roll their eyes and fill their mouths with foam. Nevertheless,
he restores them to health and sends them away normal in mind, delivering them from their straits
for a large fee. When he stands beside them as they lie there and asks, quents came you into his
body. The patient himself is silent, but the spirit answers in Greek or in the language of
whatever foreign country he comes from, telling how and whence he entered into the man. Whereupon,
by aduring the spirit, and if he does not obey, threatening him, he drives him out. Indeed, I
actually saw one coming out, black and smoky in color. Lucian's portrayal of exorcism in
The Lover of Lies cleverly navigates the fine line between societal critique, the depiction
of prevalent beliefs in ancient society. Through the lens of satire, Lucian reveals
not only the widespread acceptance and popularity of exorcist, but also hints at a more cynical
view of their motivations and the credulity of their audience. The demand for monetary compensation
by the exorcist, as highlighted by Lucian, serves as a critical commentary on the commercialization
of religious and supernatural practices. This detail is crucial, as it suggests that the exorcist
primary motive might be financial gain rather than altruistic spiritual liberation. Lucian
uses this point to subtly question the authenticity of the exorcist's powers and the sincerity of
their intentions. Meanwhile, the character Ion represents the perspective of those who whole
heartedly believe in the power of exorcisms, to Ion and presumably to many in Lucian's society.
The exorcist's ability to cast out demons is seen as a genuine liberation from suffering and fear.
This belief in the exorcist's power to heal symbolizes a deep-seated need for relief from
the unexplained and the supernatural that plagued individuals in the ancient world.
By juxtaposing these viewpoints, Lucian not only mocks the gullibility of those who uncritically
accept the exorcist's claims, but also reflects on the human condition and the universal search
for solutions to life's mysteries and maladies. His satirical approach serves as a mirror to his
society, revealing both the exploitation of belief for personal gain and the genuine desire for healing
and understanding in the face of the unknown. Through this portrayal, Lucian invites his readers
to reflect on the nature of belief, skepticism, and the power dynamics at play, and the transactions
between those who claim supernatural abilities and those who seek their aid.
Diogenes Laertius, circa 250 CE
Diogenes Laertius, an enigmatic figure in the history of classical literature,
is primarily known for his monumental work, The Lives of Imminent Philosophers.
This collection serves as a crucial source of information on the lives,
teachings, and anecdotes of ancient philosophers, ranging from the pre-Socratics to those of the
Hellenistic period. His detailed accounts begin with Thales and conclude with Epicurus, covering
a broad spectrum of philosophical traditions and schools of thought. Given the scope of Diogenes
Laertius' work, which does not extend into the era of Neoplatonism, a philosophical movement that
gained prominence in the 3rd century CE, scholars infer that he must have lived before this period.
This lack of reference to Neoplatonic philosophy suggests a dating of Diogenes Laertius' life
to the early to mid 2nd century CE. However, without direct evidence of his existence outside
his writings, much of his life remains shrouded in mystery, and any attempt to pinpoint his dates
more precisely relies heavily on contextual clues within his work. In Book 8 of The Lives of Imminent
Philosophers, Diogenes Laertius delves into the life and philosophy of Pythagoras, offering
insights into the doctrines traditionally ascribed to this seminal figure and his followers.
This section is particularly valuable for its portrayal of Pythagorean philosophy,
which encompassed not only mathematical and cosmological theories,
but also ethical and metaphysical teachings. Through Diogenes Laertius' narrative,
readers gain access to a blend of historical facts, legends, and philosophical principles
that have been attributed to Pythagoras and his school, reflecting the broader intellectual
and cultural milieu of ancient Greece. Impure souls may not approach the pure, but are bound
by the furies. Diogenes Laertius Pythagoras lives of eminent philosophers. Hermes is the steward
of souls, and for that reason is called Hermes the Escorter, Hermes the Keeper of the Gate,
and Hermes of the Underworld. Since it is he who brings in the souls from their bodies,
both by land and sea, and the pure are taken into the uppermost region, but the impure Akathartas
are not permitted to approach the pure or each other, but are bound by the furies in bonds
unbreakable. The whole air is full of souls called Gini or Daimonis, or heroes who send
people dreams and signs of future diseases. Diogenes Laertius Pythagoras lives of philosophers.
The whole air is full of souls which are called Gini, Daimonis, or heroes. These are they who
send men dreams and signs of future disease and health, and not to men alone, but to sheep also
and cattle as well. And it is to them that purifications and lustrations, all divination,
omens and the like, have reference. Papyrus Berolinensis
Daimans are capable of freezing waters so they can run over them. Papyrus Berolinensis,
hey, the Daimon, will quickly freeze rivers and seas, and in such a way that you can run
over them firmly. Berolinensis, and the biblical account of Jesus walking on water as found in
Mark 6, 45 through 52, highlights distinct conceptions of supernatural power within ancient text.
In the Papyrus Berolinensis, the Daimon's power is depicted as an alteration of the natural environment,
requiring a transformation of water into a solid state to enable passage across it.
This act of freezing large bodies of water showcases a direct manipulation of the physical
world, emphasizing the Daimon's control over natural elements. On the other hand, Jesus's
act of walking on water does not involve altering the water's physical state. Instead, it is presented
as a miraculous ability to tread upon the water in its natural, liquid form. This difference
underscores a fundamental distinction in the nature of the powers attributed to Daimans and to
Jesus. Jesus's miracle is portrayed as the direct defiance of natural laws, a testament to his
divine authority and the transcendent nature of his powers. It is an act that goes beyond
mere manipulation of the environment, suggesting a level of sovereignty over the created order.
Exorcism Stories from Non-Jewish Sources of Greco-Roman Antiquity
Step right into the captivating realm of ancient Greco-Roman exorcism tales,
where the supernatural is just another part of everyday life. Forget about authorship,
we're diving into these stories based on their themes and juicy details. Organizing them like a
curator arranges artifacts in an exhibit by their fascinating features rather than their creators.
Each story is set in its own spotlight under a subheading that hints at the drama to unfold,
making it easy for you to navigate through this maze of ancient mystique. While we tread through
these tales of old, we'll occasionally glance over at the miraculous acts attributed to Jesus,
drawing a line or two that connects across cultures. It's a journey that promises not
just a scholarly exploration, but a witty and entertaining stroll through history's shadowy
spellbinding corners. Parents petition the exorcism of their child.
Neo-Pathagorean philosopher Philostratus for the details of his life and activities. It has been
argued that Philostratus fabricated these stories to contest the Christians. This argument deserves
a lengthy treatment for which there is no room here. However, the most obvious response is that
there are too many embarrassing features about Apollonius' miracles for Neopythagoreans to
suggest that they were invented by the Neopythagoreans. But let us notice here that if they did copy
the Jesus exorcisms, it is a clear signal that they did not recognize anything about the Jesus
miracles that supported a cosmology as odd as apocalypticism. A mother petitions for the exorcism
of a soldier's ghost enamored of her son. Philostratus, 170 CE, life of Apollonius of Tiana.
This discussion, Apollonius' response to his Indian hosts about the relation of the sea to the earth,
chapter 37, was interrupted by the appearance among the sages of the messenger, bringing in
certain Indians who were in want of aid. And he brought forward a poor woman who interceded in
behalf of her child, who was, she said, a boy of 16 years of age, but had been for two years possessed
by a devil, Diamond. Now, the character of the devil was that of a mocker and a liar. Here one
of the sagas are scared. Why, she said this, and she replied, this shield of mine is extremely good
looking, and therefore the devil is a morose of him and will not allow him to retain his reason,
nor will he permit him to go to school or to learn archery, nor even to remain at home,
but drives him out into desert places. And the boy does not even retain his own voice,
but speaks in a deep hollow tone as men do. And he looks at you with other eyes rather than with
his own. As for myself, I weep over all this and I tear my cheeks and I rebuke my son so far as I
well may. But he does not know me and I made up my mind to repair hither. Indeed, I plan to do so
a year ago. Only the demon discovered himself using my child as a mask. And what he told me was
this, that he was the ghost of a man who fell long ago in battle, but that at death he was
passionately attached to his wife. Now he had been dead for only three days when his wife insulted
their union by marrying another man. And the consequence was that he had come to detest the
love of women and had transferred himself wholly into this boy. But he promised, if I would only
not denounce him to yourselves, to endow the child with many noble blessings. As for myself,
I was influenced by these promises. But he has put me off and off for such a long time now,
that he has got soul control of my household, yet has no honest or true intentions. Here the sage
asked afresh, if the boy was at hand and she said not, for although she had done all she could to
get him to come with her, the demon had threatened her with steep places and precipices and declared
that he would kill her son. In case, she added, I hailed him hither for trial. Take courage,
said the sage, for he will not slay him when he has read this. And so saying, he drew a letter
out of his bosom and gave it to the woman. And the letter, it appears, was addressed to the ghost,
to Eidolon, and contained threats of an alarming kind. In this intriguing narrative, we find ourselves
confronting the multifaceted nature of daemons, as understood in ancient times, echoing Plutarch's
belief that these spirits could tread the line between benevolence and malevolence. Here the
spotlight falls on a daemon with a vendetta, one that strips a person of their sanity,
severs family ties, and leads them into desolation. Twist, this daemon is unmasked as the restless
spirit of a soldier, embittered by a betrayal of the heart, his wife's haste to remarry following
his death. The story weaves the haunting concept that the dead could linger, transforming into spirits
with the power to harm the living. Inter-Apollonius, who approaches the situation with a blend of
diplomacy and boldness, akin to dealing with a particularly troublesome mortal. His weapon of
choice, a letter imbued with a stern warning, aimed to banish the ghostly soldier back to the realm
of the departed. This story not only explores the ancient understanding of spirits, but also
showcases the unique ways in which they were confronted and appeased, drawing parallels to
the biblical accounts found in Mark 9, 14-29, Matthew 17, 14-21, Luke 9, 37-43, and Mark 7,
24-30, Matthew 15, 21-28. We observe a similar narrative rhythm, confrontations with beings
beyond the mortal coil, though with a distinctively different approach to resolution. A point to my
careful viewers, do we believe this story of Apollonius of Tyena actually happened?
Ask yourself, does this story serve more of a narrative function for the reader and follower
of Apollonius rather than a strict literal belief in the historicity of this account?
Apply the same logic to the stories of Jesus, the exorcism of daemons who cause their victims to
harm themselves, Apollonius of Tyena. A ghost hides and leads a young man into excessive behavior.
He no longer showed himself licentious, nor did he stare madly about, but he had returned to his
own self as thoroughly as if he had been treated by drugs.
Philostratus, life of Apollonius of Tyena. Now, while he was discussing the question of
libations, there chance to be present in his audience a young dandy who bore so evil a reputation
for licentiousness that his conduct had long been the subject of course, street, corner songs.
His home was Corkshire, and he traced his pedigree to Alsinus, the Faetian who entertained Odysseus.
Apollonius then was talking about libations and was urging them not to drink out of a
particular cup, but to reserve it for the gods without ever touching it or drinking out of it,
but when he also urged them to have handleys on the cup and to pour the libation over the handle,
because that is the part of the cup at which men are least likely to drink.
The youth burst out into loud and coarse laughter and quite drowned his voice.
Then Apollonius looked up at him and said,
It is not yourself that perpetrates this insult, but the demon, Ho Daemon,
who drives you on without your knowing it, and in fact the youth was without knowing it,
possessed by a devil-dimonian, for he would laugh at things that no one else laughed at,
and then he would fall to weeping for no reason at all, and he would talk and sing to himself.
Now most people thought that it was the boisterous humor of youth which led him into such excesses,
but he was really the mouthpiece of a devil-dimonian,
though it only seemed a drunken frolic in which on that occasion he was indulging.
Now when Apollonius scazed on him, the ghost to Adolon in him began to utter cries of fear and
rage, such as one hears from people who are being branded or racket, and the ghost swore
that he would leave the young man alone and never take possession of any men again.
But Apollonius addressed him with anger, as a master might a-shifty,
rascally, and shameless slave and so on, and he ordered him to quit the young man
and show by a visible sign that he had done so.
I will throw down yonder statue, said the devil, and pointed to one of the images which were in
the king's portico, for there it was that the scene took place, but when the statue began by
moving gently and then fell down, it would defy anyone to describe the hubbub which arose there at,
and the way they clapped their hands with wonder. But the young man rubbed his eyes as if he had
just woke up, and he looked towards the rays of the sun and assumed a modest aspect, as all had
their attention concentrated on him, for he no longer showed himself licentious, nor did he
stare madly about, but he had returned to his own self, as thoroughly as if he had been treated
with drugs, and he gave up his dainty dress and summery garments, and the rest of his
cyberritic way of life, and he fell in love with the austerity of philosophers and donned their cloak
and stripping off his old self-modeled, his life in future upon that of Apollonius.
In this story, a young man's extreme emotional turmoil stirs alarm among his acquaintances,
painting a picture of a life overshadowed by a daemon, known for inciting intense emotional
outbursts and violence. The turning point in this narrative is visual and dramatic,
offering a clear signal to the onlookers that the young man has been liberated from his unseen
tormentor. This moment of clarity is not only a spectacle for the crowd, but a deeply personal
victory for the young man, who demonstrates his newfound freedom by adopting a life dedicated
to philosophy, symbolizing his complete breakaway from the chaotic influence of the daemon.
Apollonius emerges as a heroic figure in this story, showcasing his wisdom and courage by
freeing the young man from what is described as a form of a devastating enslavement to the
malevolent spirit. His approach to exorcism is not just a battle against a supernatural force,
it's also a rescue mission aimed at restoring the young man's autonomy and setting him on a
path of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment. This narrative invites comparison with the biblical
count in Mark 5, 1-20, where a man tormented by demons is healed by Jesus. Both stories share
themes of liberation and transformation, highlighting the power of higher knowledge
or divine intervention to redeem individuals from the grips of dark forces. Apollonius of
Tyanna dispels an empusa, a hobgoblin. Apollonius realized what it was and himself heaped abuse
on the hobgoblin and instructed his party to do the same, saying that this was the right remedy
for such a visitation. And the phantasm fled away shrieking even as a ghost do.
But on their way to this river, our wayfarers found the following incidents worthy of notice,
for they were traveling by bright moonlight when the figure of an empusa or hobgoblin appeared to
them that changed from one form into another and sometimes it vanished into nothing. And Apollonius
realized what it was and himself heaped abuse on the hobgoblin and instructed his party to do the
same, saying that this was the right remedy for such a visitation. And the phantasm fled away
shrieking even as ghosts do. Apollonius of Tyanna exercises an empusa who was disguised as a beautiful
woman. This is the best known story of Apollonius, for many people are aware of it and know that
the incident occurred in the center of Hellas. Philostratus, life of Apollonius of Tyanna. Now
there was in Corinth at that time a man named Demetrius who studied philosophy and had embraced in
his system all the masculine vigor of the cynics. Of him, Favarinus in several of his own works
subsequently made the most generous mention and his attitude towards Apollonius was exactly that,
which they say Antisthenes took up towards the system of Socrates, for he followed him and was
anxious to be his disciple and was devoted to his doctrines and converted to the side of Apollonius.
The more esteemed of his own puppils, among the latter was Minipus, a Lycian of 25, years of age
well endowed with good judgment and of a physique so beautifully proportioned that in Mien he resembled
a fine and gentlemanly athlete. Now this Minipus was supposed by most people to be loved by a foreign
woman who was good looking and extremely dainty and said that she was rich. Although she was really,
as it turned out, none of these things, but was only so in semblance. For as he was walking all
alone along the road towards Centrae, he met with an apparition and it was a woman who clasped his
hand and declared that she had been long in love with him and that she was a Phoenician woman and
lived in a suburb of Corinth and she mentioned the name of the particular suburb and said,
when you reach the place this evening you will hear my voice as I sing to you and you shall have wine
such as you never before drank and there will be no rival to disturb you and we too beautiful
beings will live together. The youth consented to this for although he was in general a strenuous
philosopher, he was nevertheless susceptible to the tender passion and he visited her in the
evening and for the future constantly sought her company as his darling for he did not yet
realize that she was a mere apparition. Then Apollonius looked over Minipus as a sculptor
might do and sketched an outline of the youth and examined him and having observed his foibles he
said you are a fine youth and are hunted by fine women but in this case you are cherishing a serpent
and a serpent cherishes you and when Minipus expressed his surprise he added for this lady
is of a kind you cannot marry why should you do you think that she loves you indeed I do
said the youth since she behaves to me as if she loves me and would you then marry her said Apollonius
why yes for it would be delightful to marry a woman who loves you there upon Apollonius asked
when the wedding was to be perhaps tomorrow said the other for it brooks no delay Apollonius
therefore waited for the occasion of the wedding breakfast and then presenting himself before the
guests who had just arrived he said where is the dainty lady at whose instance you come
here she is replied Minipus and at the same moment he rose slightly from his seat blushing
and to which of you belong the silver and gold and all the rest of the decorations
of the banqueting hall to the lady replied the youth for this is all I have of my own
pointing to the philosopher's cloak which he wore and Apollonius said have you heard of the
gardens of tantalus how they exist and yet do not exist yes they answered in the poems of Homer
for we certainly never went down to Hades as such replied Apollonius you must regard this
adornment for it is not reality but the semblance of reality and that you may realize the truth of
what I say this fine bride is one of the vampires that is to say of those beings whom the many
regard as lameas and hobgoblins these beings fall in love and they are devoted to the delights of
Aphrodite but especially to the flesh of human beings and they decoy with such delights those
whom they mean to devour in their feasts and the lady said cease your ill omen talk and be gone
and she pretended to be disgusted at what she heard and no doubt she was inclined to rail at
philosophers and say that they always talk nonsense when however the goblets of gold
and the show of silver were proved as light as air and all fluttered away out of their sight
while the winebearers and the cooks and all the retinue of servants vanished before the rebukes
of Apollonius the phantom pretended to weep and prayed him not to torture her nor to compel her
to confess what she really was but Apollonius insisted and would not let her off and then
she admitted that she was a vampire and was fattening up Manipus with pleasures before devouring
his body for it was her habit to feed upon young and beautiful bodies because their blood is pure
and strong I have related at length because it was necessary to do so this is the best known story
of Apollonius for many people are aware of it and know that the incident occurred in the center of
Hellas but they have only heard in a general and vague manner that he once caught and overcame
Alamia in Corinth but they have never learned what she was about nor that he did it to save Manipus
but I owe my own account to Damus and to the work which he wrote. Damus or Damus is supposed to have
been a disciple of Apollonius but scholars conclude there is little evidence for his actual
historical existence nevertheless the stories seem to have been passed along for centuries the
nature and identity of demons demons in the non-apocalyptic Jewish writings of the imperial period
in this exploration of the intriguing world of demons or demons as they're sometimes known
we venture into the heart of non-apocalyptic Jewish literature from the imperial period
our journey begins with a foundation in scripture specifically two pivotal texts from the Septuagint
that cast light on these enigmatic beings the mysterious account of Genesis 6 1 through 4
and the captivating narrative found in Tobit 6 1 through 8 9 from there we delve into the writings
of Jewish scholars and historians of the Greco-Roman era including the philosophical musings of Philo
the historical accounts of Josephus and the legal discussions in the Mishnah these texts provide us
with perspectives on the nature and function of demons demons in Jewish thought offering
insights into how these beings were perceived their roles within the cosmos and their interactions
with humanity our exploration then takes a dramatic turn with two riveting stories of demon
expulsion the first is drawn from the genesis apocryphon offering a glimpse into the ancient
narratives that expanded upon the canonical scriptures the second account comes from Josephus
whose writings bridge the gap between history and legend providing a unique viewpoint on the
practice of exorcism within the Jewish tradition of his time through this comprehensive examination
we aimed to shed light on the multifaceted roles that demons demons played in Jewish thought
and society during the imperial period tracing their evolution from scriptural entities to
characters in the broader cultural and religious landscape of the Greco-Roman world scripture
the sons of god unite with human women who give birth to giants the sons of god went in to the
daughters of humans who bore children to them these were the heroes that were of old warriors of
renown when people began to multiply on the face of the ground and daughters were born to them too
the sons of god saw that they were fair and they took wives for themselves of all they chose
three then the lord said my spirit shall not abide in mortals forever for they are flesh
their days shall be 120 years the Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward
when the sons of god went into the daughters of humans who bore children to them these were the
heroes that were of old warriors of renown the intriguing reference to half-breeds in these
ancient texts sparks a fascinating discussion especially within the context of Hellenistic
Judaism staunch monotheism these beings though not identified as demons or demons emerge from
narratives mentioning the sons of god a concept that intriguingly blurs the lines between the
divine and the mortal this notion introduces the idea of beings that occupy a liminal space between
humanity and the singular deity of monotheistic belief a theme that both captivates and challenges
traditional interpretations as we delve deeper it becomes clear that these stories are not just
ancient myths they are the precursors to a more complex theological discourse that would later
flourish in apocalyptic literature these stories of extraordinary beings lay the groundwork for
the future narratives creating a base upon which the intricate world of apocalyptic visions will be
intricately crafted in the upcoming documentary we will explore how this narrative thread is picked
up and expanded in apocalyptic writings highlighting the enduring fascination with the nature of beings
that exist in the shadowy realm between the human and the divine Tobit exercises the demon who has
killed the seven former husbands of his new wife an angel Raphael instructs Tobias that smoked fish
heart and liver will exercise a demon Tobit 6191 the young man Tobias went out and the angel went
with him two and the dog came out with him and went along with them so they both journeyed along
and when the first night overtook them they camped by the tigress river three then the young man went
down to wash his feet in the tigress river suddenly a large fish leapt up from the water and tried to
swallow the young man's foot and he cried out four but the angel said to the young man catch hold
of the fish and hang on to it so the young man grasped the fish and drew it up on the land five
then the angel said to him cut open the fish and take out its gall heart and liver keep them with
you but throw away the intestines for its gall heart and liver are useful as medicine six so after
cutting open the fish the young man gathered together the gall heart and liver then he roasted
and ate some of the fish and kept some to be salted the two continued on their way together
until they were near media seven then the young man questioned the angel and said to him brother
azariah what medicinal value is there in the fish's heart and liver and in the gall eight he replied
as for the fish's heart and liver you must burn them to make a smoke in the presence of a man or
woman afflicted by a demon or evil spirit and every affliction will flee away and never remain
with that person any longer nine and as for the gall anoint a person's eyes where white films have
appeared on them blow upon them upon the white films and the eyes will be healed rafael instructs
tabias how to exercise the demon who killed his betrothed seven husbands tobit six to ten 1810
when he entered media and already was approaching ekpatana 11 rafael the angel said to the young
man brother tabias here i am he answered then rafael said to him we must stay this night in the home
of raguel he is your relative and he has a daughter named sarah 12 he has no male heir and no daughter
except sarah only and you as next of kin to her have before all other men a hereditary claim on her
also it is right for you to inherit her father's possessions moreover the girl is sensible brave
and very beautiful and her father is a good man 13 he continued you have every right to take her in
marriage so listen to me brother tonight i will speak to her father about the girl so that we
may take her to be your bride when we return from rages we will celebrate her marriage for i know
that raguel can by no means keep her from you or promise her to another man without incurring the
penalty of death according to the decree of the book of moses 14 then tabias said in answer to
rafael brother azaria i have heard that she already has been married to seven husbands
and that they died in the bridal chamber on the night when they went into her they would die
i have heard people saying that it was a demon that killed them 15 it does not harm her but it
kills anyone who desires to approach her so now since i am the only son my father has i am afraid
that i may die and bring my father's and mother's life down to their grave grieving for me and they
have no other son to bury them 16 but rafael said to him do you not remember your father's orders
when he commanded you to take a wife from your father's house now listen to me brother and say
no more about this demon take her i know that this very night she will be given to you in marriage
17 when you enter the bridal chamber take some of the fish's liver and heart and put them on
the embers of the incense an odor will be given off 18 the demon will smell it and flee and will
never be seen near her anymore now when you're about to go to bed with her both of you must first
stand up and pray imploring the lord of heaven that mercy and safety may be granted to you
do not be afraid for she was set apart for you before the world was made you will save her
and she will go with you i presume that you will have children by her and they will be as brothers
to you now say no more when tabias heard the words of rafael and learned that she was his kinswoman
related through his father's lineage he loved her very much and his heart was drawn to her
the marriage is proposed and the contract is written out and sealed and a dinner is prepared
tobit seven nine fifteen tabias obediently follows rafael's instructions
tobit seven fifteen eight nine fifteen reguel called his wife edna and said to her sister get the
other room ready and take her there 16 so she went and made the bed in the room as he had told her
and brought sarah there she wept for her daughter then wiping away the tears she said to her take
courage my daughter the lord of heaven grant you joy in place of your sorrow take courage my daughter
then she went out eight one when they had finished eating and drinking they wanted to retire so they
took the young man and brought him into the bedroom two then tabias remembered the words of rafael
and he took the fish's liver and heart out of the bag where he had them and put them on the embers
of the incense three the odor of the fish so repelled the demon that he fled to the remotest
parts of egypt but rafael followed him and at once bound him there hand and foot four when the
parents had gone out and shut the door of the room tabias got out of bed and said to sarah sister
get up and let us pray and implore our lord that he grant us mercy and safety five so she got up
and they beg and to pray and implore that they might be kept safe tabias began by saying
blessed are you oh god of our ancestors and blessed is your name in all generations forever
six you made adam and for him you made his wife eve as a helper and support from the two of them
the human race has sprung you said it is not good that the man should be alone let us make a helper
for him like himself seven i now am taking this kin's woman of mine not because of lust but with
sincerity grant that she and i may find mercy and that we may grow old together eight and they both
said amen amen nine then they went to sleep for the night when we compare the evidence of the
ideas about demons in this account with the sort of concepts we find in plutarq one noticeable
differences in the clear and separate category given to the angels in plutarq's treatment good
and evil are both called daemons as we have seen in this account the angels seem to belong to a
special group and their names plainly identify them as messengers in fact the angel rafael could be
an embodiment of the good daemons in plutarq he serves god acting as a messenger a unifier and a
prophet in oracles in this story the good daemon rafael acts as an oracle to the obedient
tobit against the bad daemon a second important difference is the explicit demand for prayer
it is not the technique alone that will ensure the expulsion of the daemon but the technique
accompanied by a sincere appeal to the merciful god phylo 30 bce to 45 ce
navigating through phylo's evolving thoughts on demons is a bit like watching a philosophical
saga unfold across three captivating acts as detailed by the keen observations of dr fredrik
let's break down this intellectual journey into its thrilling parts in the opening act phylo
introduces us to a world where angels or as he intriguingly calls them daemon's psyche
flipped through the air like incorporeal human souls on a celestial ballet it's a vision where
the boundaries between the ethereal and the human soul are as thin as gossamer setting the stage for
a narrative rich with spiritual intrigue as the plot thickens in the second act phylo begins to
blend genres here angels still dance as daemon's psyche but they've been upgraded to logoi status
think of them as divine messengers carrying cosmic wisdom it's a transitional phase where phylo's
thinking starts to shift gears paving the way for a grand philosophical pivot and then in the
climatic third act phylo takes a bold leap into a realm where angels are no longer just ethereal
beings but embody logoi essentially divine inspirations or good thoughts it's a dramatic
departure from traditional demonology where demons were often seen as sources of inspiration at best
phylo redefines the narrative positioning these entities not as external influencers
but as embodiments of divine wisdom one of phylo's most intriguing plot twists occur
in his treatment of genesis six one through four in his work on the giants here he interprets the
tale of celestial beings mingling with mortals not as a lurid tabloid headline of ancient mythology
but as a symbolic exploration of the soul's descent into the corporeal realm of fleshly concerns
phylo isn't in the business of adding mythical creatures to the scriptural cast instead he
sees the narrative as an allegory for the journey of heavenly souls into human experience debunking
fears of fantastical hybrid beings phylo's perspective is that the cosmos is a producer
of souls with the air churning out spirits as naturally as earth sprouts flora these souls
might linger in the celestial realms basking in their consecrated status or dive into the human
saga enriching it with their divine essence but always remaining distinct from the fantastical
hybrids of lore some souls descend into bodies and some become consecrated for the service of god
these earthly souls can become immersed in superficial concerns or soar to heaven through
philosophy phylo on the giants now some of the souls have descended into bodies but others have
never deigned to be brought into union with any of the parts of the earth they are consecrated and
devoted to the service of the father and creator whose won't it is to employ them as ministers and
helpers to have charge and care of mortal man but the others descending into the body as though into
a stream have sometimes been caught in the swirl of its rushing torrent and swallowed up thereby at
other times have been able to stem the current have risen to the surface and then soared upwards
back to the place from whence they came these last then are the souls of those who have given
themselves to genuine philosophy who from first to last study to die to the life in the body
that a higher existence immortal and incorporeal in the presence of him who is himself immortal
and uncreate may be their portion but the souls which have sunk beneath the stream
are the souls of the others who have held no count of wisdom they have abandoned themselves to the
unstable things of chance none of which has ought to do with our noblest part the soul or mind but
all are related to that dead thing which was our birth fellow the body or to objects more lifeless
still glory wealth and offices and honors and all other illusions which like images or pictures
are created through the deceit of false opinion by those who have never gazed upon true beauty
it is a superstitious idea to imagine that bad daemons are a special species distinct from good
daemons the difference between them is in unfaithfulness to a previous divine consecration
not a difference in species fellow on the giants so if you realize that souls and demons daemoners
and angels are but different names for the same one underlying object you will cast from you that
most grievous burden the fear of demons or superstition the common usage of men is to give the name of
demon daemoners to bad and good daemons alike and the name of soul psychers to good and bad souls
and so too you also will not go wrong if you reckon as angels not only those who are worthy of the
name who are as ambassadors backwards and forwards between men and god and are rendered sacred and
inviolate by reason of that glorious and blameless ministry but also those who are unholy and
unworthy of the title the contribution that both Josephus and phylo bring to our efforts to
reconstruct ideas available to people living in greco-roman antiquity as its spirits are to be
expected just as surely as one knows of the existence of air or wind second these creatures
are intelligent and make choices rather than being by nature only capable of good or only capable
of evil third the soul within a person longs for spiritual life and one must beware of sinking
into the mire of the physical Josephus 70 to 90 CE Josephus aligns with the prevailing greco-roman
perspectives on spirits as highlighted by Everett Ferguson's analysis in demonology of the early
christian world in his use of the term daemon Josephus applies it broadly to encompass divine
power destiny and the forces behind misfortune as well as explicitly evil entities ferguson
points out that Josephus specifies when a daemon represents a benevolent force by attaching the
qualifier good to it this nuanced approach reflects the complexity of spiritual beliefs in Josephus's
time where spirits could embody a wide range of roles from divine agents and arbiters of
fate to malevolent forces with the distinction of their nature made clear through descriptive
adjectives the so-called demons are spirits of wicked men the root of the plant barris is used
to expel demons Josephus Jewish war flame colored and towards evening emitting a brilliant light
it the plant barris eludes the grasp of persons who approach with the intention of plucking it
as it shrinks up and can only be made to stand still by pouring upon it certain secretions of
the human body yet even then to touch it is fatal unless one succeeds in carrying off the root itself
suspended from the hand with all these attendant risks it possesses one virtue for which it is
prized for the so-called demons in other words the spirits of wicked men which enter the living
and kill them unless aid is forthcoming are promptly expelled by this route if merely applied to the
patients and god granted him Solomon knowledge of the art used against demons demonion for the
benefit and healing of people Josephus Jewish antiquities there was no form of nature with
which he king Solomon was not acquainted or which he passed over without examining but he
studied them all philosophically and revealed the most complete knowledge of their several properties
and god granted him knowledge of the art used against demons demonion for the benefit and
healing of men he also composed incantations by which illnesses are relieved and left behind
forms of exorcisms with which those possessed by demons drive them out never to return three
concepts about the nature and identity of demons demons one successful exorcism is joined to erudition
Josephus claims that Solomon had probed the understanding of the phenomenon of possession
philosophically god grants knowledge of the art the association of exorcism with specialized
study backs up Plutarch's scholarly discussion of the nature of demons within the larger cosmology
this underlines the fact that one may not assume that possession and exorcism were
universally regarded as superstitious and low class by men of letters and antiquity to Josephus
explains exorcism as a type of healing this means that when exorcisms occur in the christian
material they cannot be assumed to imply the beginning of satan's downfall or of an imminent
three successful exorcisms require the knowledge of efficacious forms so that the demons demons do
not return the notion that Solomon left this legacy provides an honorable context for the
exorcism stories attached to important Jewish figures thus any hint of magic in a pejorative
sense is dispelled Mishnah and the nature and identity of evil spirits
the Mishnah a cornerstone of Jewish rabbinic literature was codified around 190 CE making
it a significant post new testament text that aimed to solidify emerging rabbinic teachings
despite its official compilation in the late second century much of its content is acknowledged
to have originated well before that time reflecting a continuity of Jewish thought and practice
within the Mishnah the acknowledgement of demons illustrates the integration of spiritual beliefs
into Jewish life and law three specific passages highlight this acknowledgement
per K a bolt five six this section part of a collection of ethical teachings references
demons in a context that underscores the broader spiritual and moral universe within which these
teachings were meant to be applied Shabbat 2.5 here the discussion involves Sabbath laws where
the mention of demons may relate to the intricacies of observing religious commandments in a world
perceived as filled with both seen and unseen forces Eruvan 4.1 this passage dealing with the
laws of Eruvan or the mixing of domains on the Sabbath similarly reflects an awareness of the
spiritual dimensions impact on daily and religious life these references to demons in the Mishnah not
only attest to the belief in such beings but also highlight how spiritual understandings were woven
into the fabric of Jewish legal and ethical discourse they reveal a world where the spiritual
material coexisted influencing how laws were interpreted and ethical life was conceived
the evil spirits were created on the eve of the Sabbath
per K a both 10 things were created on the eve of the Sabbath between the sons at nightfall
the mouth of the earth the mouth of the well the mouth of the she ass the rainbow and the manner
and the rod and the Shamir the letters and the writing and the tables of stone some say also
the evil spirits and the sepulchre of moses and the ram of Abraham our father some say also
the tongs made with tongs because evil spirits are attracted to a light the Sabbath lamp may be
extinguished if one fears an evil spirit is near Shabbat if a man put out the lamp on the night
of the Sabbath from fear of the Gentiles or of thieves or of an evil spirit or to suffer one
that was sick to sleep he is not culpable but if he did it with a mind to spare the lamp or to
spare the oil or to spare the wick he is culpable but our Jose declares him exempt in every case
accepting that of the wick since he thereby forms charcoal evil spirits have power to transport a
person from one place to another a ruben 4.133 if a man was taken out beyond the Sabbath limit
by Gentiles or an evil spirit he may only move within four cubits if they brought him back again
it is as though he had never gone out if they brought him to another town or set him in a
cattle pen or a cattle fold Rabban Gamaliel and our Eliezer be Azariah say he may traverse their
whole area but our Joshua and our Akiba say he may only move within four cubits it happened when
they came from Brundisium and when their ship was sailing in the sea that Rabban Gamaliel and our
Eliezer be Azariah walked the whole length of the ship but our Joshua and our Akiba
did not stir beyond four cubits since they were minded to apply to themselves the more stringent
ruling these three texts then signal some common traditions about the nature and character of the
demons such as we have seen in the non-Jewish texts preke of both 5.6 shows that some Jewish
communities do regard evil spirits as a hybrid species rather than a singular pure beings the
angels or souls of Philo. Sabbath and Eruban suggests that living with demons is as possible a
danger as living subject to Gentiles when we find Torah prescriptions that deal with observance in
the face of Gentile or demon interference we have a sign that the community expects both Gentiles
and demons to feature in ordinary life what we do not find is any evidence that the community sees
these demons as the lackeys of any great identifiable demon lord such as Belzebel or Belial nor is there
any reference to the coming end when these demons will be punished by gods avenging angels in other
words the apocalyptic themes and expectations do not seem to be present in the treatment of demonic
interference with ordinary Jewish life rather the sense of the demon as a creature of the
liminal space between the divine and the human and capable of bringing grief to humans is what we
find as we do in the speech of Plutarch's Cleombrotus so in this way the mission reflects the more
general ideas of demons in the Greco-Roman world rather than echoing the organization of demonic
and angelic armies and the organization of time that we find so prominently in apocalyptic documents
evil spirit demon stories from Jewish sources in Greco-Roman antiquity kumran documents the Genesis
Apocryphon the Genesis Apocryphon found among the kumran documents offers a fascinating glimpse
into Jewish beliefs about demons during the Greco-Roman period this text often described as a
little Genesis due to its embellished retellings of Genesis narratives dates between 50 BCE and 70 CE
JC Trevor highlights its similarities in character and content to the book of Jubilees
suggesting a shared cultural or religious backdrop that enriched the patriarchal legends with
vivid details and dramatic flair in particular column 20 of the Genesis Apocryphon revisits the
story from Genesis 12 10 through 20 featuring Abrams Abraham's expulsion of a demon this incident
while not found in the canonical Hebrew Bible provides valuable insight into how the community
responsible for the Genesis Apocryphon perceived demons through Abraham's or Abrams confrontation
with an evil spirit we glimpse the beliefs and practices related to demonic forces at the time
including the notion that such beings could interact with and influence the human realm
and that righteous individuals possessed the authority or ability to expel these malevolent
entities this story and others like it from the kumran text underscores a broader Jewish
understanding of the spiritual world in which demons were a real and present danger the
ability to expel a demon as demonstrated by Abram reflects a belief in the power of faith
and righteousness to overcome evil influences a theme that resonates with Jewish exorcist traditions
and the broader cultural milieu of Greco-Roman antiquity Genesis 12 10 through 20 10 now there
was a famine in the land so Abram went down to Egypt to reside there as an alien for the famine
was severe in the land 11 when he was about to enter Egypt he said to his wife Sarai I know well
that you are a woman beautiful in appearance 12 and when the Egyptians see you they will say
this is his wife then they will kill me but they will let you live 13 say you are my sister
that it may go well with me because of you and that my life may be spared on your account 14
when Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful 15 when the
officials of Pharaoh saw her they praised her to Pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house
16 and for her sake he dealt well with Abram and he had sheep oxen male donkeys male and female
slaves female donkeys and camels 17 but the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of Sarai Abram's wife 18 so Pharaoh called Abram and said what is this you have done to me
why did you not tell me that she was your wife 19 why did you say she is my sister so that I took
her for my wife now then here is your wife take her and be gone 20 and Pharaoh gave men orders
concerning him and they set him on the way with his wife and all that he had having lied to Pharaoh
that Sarah is his sister Abram calls on God to prevent Pharaoh from having relations with her
Genesis Apocryphon the beauty of Sarah is praised by the Pharaoh's servants when the king heard the
words of Hikarnos and the words of his two companions for the three of them spoke as one man he coveted
her very much he sent off in haste and had her brought to him when he beheld her he marveled at
all her beauty and took her to himself as a wife he sought to kill me Abram but Sarai said to the
king he is my brother so that I might be benefited by her and I Abram was spared because of her I
was not killed but I wept bitterly I Abram and lot my nephew with me on the night when Sarai was
taken away from me by force that night I prayed I entreated and I asked for mercy in my sorrow I
said as my tears ran down my cheeks blessed are you oh god most high my lord for all ages for you
are lord and master overall and have power to meet out justice to all the kings of the earth
now I lodge my complaint with you my lord against the pharaoh Zohan the king of Egypt because my
wife has been taken away from me by force meet out justice to him for me and show forth your great
hand against him and against all his house may he not be able to defile my wife tonight
that it may be known about you my lord that you are the lord of all the kings of the earth
and I wept and talked to no one the lord sends a pestilential spirit to afflict pharaoh and all
the men of his household for the next two years genesis apocryphon but that night god most high
sent him a pestilential spirit to afflict him and all the men of his household an evil spirit
that kept afflicting him and all the men of his household he was not able to approach her
nor did he have intercourse with her though he was with her for two years at the end of two years
the plagues and afflictions became more severe and more intense for him and all the men of his
household when pharaoh calls on all the wise men physicians magicians to cure him and the spirit
afflicts them too he turns to abram as he has been led to do by a dream genesis apocryphon so he
sent for all the wise men of egypt all the magicians and all the physicians of egypt to see if they
could cure him of this plague and the men of his household but none of the physicians the magicians
nor any of the wise men were able to rise up and cure him for the spirit afflicted all of them
too and they fled then her carnos came to me and begged me to come and pray over the king
and lay my hands upon him that he might be cured for he had seen me in a dream when lot explains
that abram cannot pray for pharaoh while abram's wife is still with him pharaoh upbrades abram for
his lie and gives her to abram genesis apocryphon but lot said to him abram my uncle cannot pray for
the king while his wife sarai is with him now go tell the king that he should send his wife away
from him back to her own husband then he abram will pray for him that he might be cured when her
carnos heard lot's words he went and said to the king all these plagues and afflictions with which
my lord the king is beset and afflicted are due to sarai the wife of abram let sarai be returned to
her husband abram and this plague will depart from you as well as the spirit of purulence
so he the pharaoh summoned me to him and said to me what have you done to me for sarai's sake
in telling me she is my sister when she was really your wife and i took her to be my wife
here is your wife take her away go depart from all the provinces of egypt but now pray for me
and for my household that this evil spirit may be commanded to depart from us abram lays hand
on pharaoh's head and the evil spirit is commanded to depart apocryphon so i prayed for that and i
laid my hands upon his head the plague was removed from him and the evil spirit was commanded to
depart from him and he was cured and the king rose and made known to me and the king swore an oath
to me that he had not touched her and then they brought sarai to me the king gave her much silver
and gold many garments of fine linen and purple and he laid them before her and heigar too he handed
her over to me and appointed men to escort me out of egypt so i abram went forth with very many
flocks and with silver and gold too and i went up from egypt lot my brother's son was with me
and lot too had acquired many flocks he had taken for himself a wife from the daughters of egypt
in this story the evil spirit is not presented as being who is rebellious to god but rather
one obedient to his commands it is not a ghost but a separate spiritual being meant to serve god
in this way the ideas cohere with those of plutar who see daemons as capable of good or evil in
this case the evil spirit fulfills the role of meeting out justice on god's behalf while the
evil spirit brings trouble to ferro and his servants his services to help abraham thus the
evil description is really relative to the situation and people involved notice that
just as the demon is sent by god so too he is commanded to leave by god thus although abram
is said to lay hands on ferro it is clear that the narrator does not want it to be understood
that abram exerts direct authority over the demon his laying on of the hands becomes part of his
sincere prayer to god so the demon is ordered to depart jocephus
king sauz exercised from his demons by david and against that trouble caused by the evil spirits
whensoever they assailed him he had no other physician than david who by singing his songs
playing upon the harp restored saul to himself antiquities of the jews so after these exhortations
to the youth david samuel went his way and the deity abandoned saul and passed over to david
who when the divine spirit had removed to him began to prophesy but as for saul he was beset by
strange disorders and evil spirits to daemonia which caused him such suffocation and strangling
that the physicians could devise no other remedy saved to order search to be made for one with power
to charm away spirits and to play upon the harp and whensoever the evil spirit should assail
and torment saul to have him stand over the king and strike the strings and chant his songs saul
did not neglect this advice but ordered search to be made for such a man and when one of those
present said that he had seen in the city of bethlehem a son of jessie a mere boy in years but
of pleasing and fair appearance and in other ways worthy of regard who was moreover skilled in playing
on the harp and in the singing of songs and an excellent soldier saul sent to jessie and ordered
him to take david from the flocks and send him to him he wished he said to see the young man
having heard of his comeliness and valor so jessie sent his son also giving him presence to
carry to saul when he came saul was delighted with him made him his amour bearer and held him in the
highest honor for his illness was charmed away by him and against that trouble caused by the evil
spirits whensoever they assailed him he had no other physician than david who by singing his songs
and playing upon the harp restored saul to himself he accordingly sent to jessie the lads
father desiring him to leave david with him since the sight of the boy and his presence gave him
pleasure jessie would not gain say saul but permitted him to keep david here josephus represents the
story of david bringing peace of mind as a kind of constant exorcism by his powerful charm the
method is just to sing songs and play the harp no incantations or spells the singing and playing
is sufficient to cause the demons to leave josephus is speaking to pagans who are obviously prepared
to understand a story such as this and josephus presumes that this explanation of david's singing
and playing will be seen as credible and a very good explanation for saul's feeling better evil
spirits bring great disturbance to mind and spirit the text calls david a physician exorcism
of this type if it brings wholeness to the patient's health is the job of a doctor so josephus calls
exorcism a healing for the romans these songs would have had the power of the well-known karmine
eliezer the Pharisee 70 to 90 c e draws on solomon's methods for exorcisms we have been induced
to speak of these things in order that all may know the greatness of solomon's nature and how
god favored him josephus antiquities and this kind of cure solomon's forms of exorcisms is a very
great power among us to this day for i have seen a certain eliezer a countryman of mine josephus
in the presence of vespecian his sons tribunes and a number of other soldiers free men possessed by
demons and this was the manner of the cure he put to the nose of the possessed man a ring which had
under its seal one of the roots prescribed by solomon and then as the man smelled it drew out the
demon through his nostrils and when the man at once fell down adjured the demon never to come back
into him speaking solomon's name and reciting the incantations which he had composed then wishing
to convince the bystanders and prove to them that he had this power eliezer placed a cup or
foot basin full of water a little way off and commanded the demon as it went out of the man
to overturn it and make known to the spectators that he had left the man and when this was done
the understanding and wisdom of solomon were clearly revealed on account of which we have
been induced to speak of these things in order that all men may know the greatness of his solomon's
nature and how god favored him and that no one under the sun may be ignorant of the king's surpassing
virtue of every kind notice that eliezer gets the demon to behaves that he can prove to his audience
how efficacious his power is this is what we see also in apollonius's exorcism of the young dandy
both phylo stratus and josephus show that a listening audience appreciates some proof that
demons are indeed present and are subject to the hero next apocalyptic exorcisms
demons and exorcisms were all over the roman world at the time while jews attributed these
magical exorcisms in a long tradition spanning back to solomon christians to jesus the roman world
had a long tradition of daemons from homer and hessia various sources like plutarch's description
of daemons calcis criticisms of jesus miracles and exorcisms being from egyptian sorcerers and
charlatans apolaus of madara being accused of possession through magic lucian syrian from
palestine apollonius of tayana eliezer solomon david abram to bias we see a well-established
exorcism tradition with jewish and christian religious scenes forming to the cosmology of the
day in the roman world the shift towards all demons being evil in the judaeo christian tradition
and daemons being both good and evil from the greco roman tradition is a blast to recognize
i find the comparison between apollonius of tayana a late first century exorcist and son of god
to be a great comparison to jesus in the competing figures of this period i hope one will walk away
better informed on the topic of demons and see that christianity doesn't have a monopoly on
exorcisms thanks to dr wendy codder's book for these primary sources make sure you get a copy
