Welcome back to MythVision Podcast. My name is Derek Lambert and I'm the host. Today we're going to be touching on a really sensitive topic. It's not sensitive to us, but it's sensitive to many people who have kind of a conspiratorial mindset.
And that is the Kabbalah. What is the historical context? What is the Kabbalah? When was it written? See, the who, what, when, where, why, how, all of that is so important when we investigate this literature because it has been weaponized against minority groups such as Jews.
And there are bad actors in all of this literature. Dr. Justin Sledge will point this out. There is nothing to shy away from. But when you see people use this kind of literature in modern day period or even in history such as the Nazis and such who were running into this kind of material trying to use it against Jews, you have to be very critical.
Bring your skepticism to this kind of propaganda that is used against people. Because I want to know what it is. Where was this written? Who was this intended for? What were they trying to convey? And what's the meaning behind it? That's what we're going to try and discuss today with Dr. Justin Sledge. And I hope that you stick around. Stay tuned. Hit the like button. Share this content to somebody who thinks this somehow predicts the next presidential election or something. And stay tuned for the ride. I appreciate you all.
John, do you want to know what the truth is? After this, there's no turning back. You take the blue pill and you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to. You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland. And I show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Thank you to everybody who's hitting the Like button and who's sticking around for Dr. Justin Sledge. How are you, my friend?
my friend. I'm doing very well Derek. It's great to be back on MythVision. It's been a little while.
It's great to be back on. We always appreciate your presence here and always learn something new
and I know a lot of people walk away from your videos just blown away especially me on your
recent Yahweh video. I said wow this was a it is a very complicated matter. I'm trying to discover
where Yahweh comes from and and I've talked to some scholars. One of them I can't remember
his name. He's in South Africa and it is so complicated. You had simplified it and popularized
it in such a way that video's gone viral. Where's it at in views right now? Oh I don't even know.
Maybe north of six. Almost 700,000 views. Yeah it's done quite well.
Yeah it did quite well and I think it's doing quite well because it's a very challenging
idea and that speaks to people's character. They want to be challenged and you know and again I
don't pretend that the video does anything more than just sort of lay out kind of where the rough
consensus of scholarship is but yeah what part a great deal of what the video is and I think a lot
of what people were dissatisfied with it about it is that we don't know and you know we don't know
what we don't do at least in my opinion is we don't say well the Bible says this it must be that.
The Bible's just one piece of evidence that we can add to the pile and so yeah so it's
in that way. It's quite a complicated question and it's complicated by the fact that
the great Bronze Age collapse doesn't make anything any clearer. We just have so little
evidence and where it seems that y'all came from was not a terribly developed area and so
there aren't written text and there's not much archaeological evidence. There's so many interesting
things about that too. I mean it is a mystery to try and figure out but that mystery allows so many
people to I would say even wiggle out of problems but even if they did discover where exactly came
from they'd find another way if they're trying hard enough. Subscribe to Dr. Justin Sledge YouTube
channel Esoterica. Dr. Sledge has a website as well where you can go and there's a lot of ways to
contact or buy books from him. You're always doing stuff right? Yeah yeah I'm just actually
also dealing with antiquarian rare books on topics and occultism. I actually have a new
catalog coming out here in the next few weeks so I'm have a good chunk of books from the 17th
century coming in which will be some pretty cool ones I think so folks are interested in that kind
of thing. I'm also a dealing antiquarian occult books. Nice and then you also have the Patreon
Patreon. I always say Patreon but you know I think I say Patreon too I don't know what the
I think the right way to say it is that people understand you and sign up. I think if they
understand you and sign up you said it correctly. So yeah if you love what Dr. Justin Sledge is doing
go and sign up. And I just googled right? I was like conspiracy theories surrounding Kabbalah
and of course there's always somebody and I noticed why conspiracy theories keep turning
into Jewish mysticism from early Nazis to modern day MAGA etc but I just thought this was interesting
in this like little clip. I'm not going to play it. At Klepper's urging she types a few phrases
into her mystical all-seeing Gamatria calculator phone app. The phrase America is in a bad place.
She finds yields the same Gamatria value as let's go Brandon. Now famous coded catchphrase used to
decry President Joe Biden. She grins triumphantly. Do you have goosebumps yet? She asked Klepper.
He looks incredulous. Clearly for this subject or for his subject this lady there's only one
possible meaning. Anyway I want to get into the nitty gritty details here and first ask you
what makes you an expert to be able to even tell us what this book is about?
So the Kabbalah you mean? Yes. So the Kabbalah isn't one book just to be clear. It's actually a
tradition. In fact it just is the Hebrew word for to receive right? So the name for the service that
we do on Friday nights for welcoming the Sabbath is called Kabbalah Shabbat. The welcoming the
receiving of the Sabbath. So Kabbalah just means the ones to receive and people who do Kabbalah
are the receivers is literally what the word straightforwardly means in Hebrew. Of course
it means more than that now. But why am I an expert? I've studied this material academically. I have
there's only one place really in the world that it grants degrees in the academic study of
Western as a Terrorism and that's the University of Amsterdam and I graduated from there. In fact
I'm going back there this summer to do some probably do some work with the library there and
and the university. So there are very few places in the world that grant a degree
in this kind of material and I have one of those degrees. So that's so that's I guess that's that
and I tend to specialize in Kabbalah mostly in the early modern uptake of Kabbalah into the sort
of occult world. So that would be the transformation of Jewish Kabbalah into Christian Kabbalah and
then the uptake of Christian Kabbalah into what we now know as Western as a Terrorism. So folks in
the chat may know people like Johans Ruchelin, Dela Porta Giovanni, Francisco Dela Porta, John D.
General Bruno. So there's some luminary figures in the history of Western occultism are all very
much informed deeply Alistair Crowley of course very informed by the Kabbalah. So there's just no
doing Western occultism without reference to without without reference to the Kabbalah. So that's
typically where I tend to enter into it but my study the whole the whole the whole Megillah
to mix my metaphors. So you told us what the word means and of course it seems there's a practice
behind this this literature there's kind of a tradition. What is it? Yeah so this is where
things get really complicated really fast. So Kabbalah is it's a form of Jewish mysticism.
It's important to point out that Judaism has existed a long time in various iterations and
that there have been forms of Jewish mysticism that existed prior to Kabbalah. So Kabbalah is not
all of Jewish mysticism but Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism. Previous forms of mysticism
that existed before the Kabbalah were things like Merkava mysticism where you would descend
into the various palaces of God to become enthroned on the divine throne. You could become
transformed into an angel like happens in third Enoch. It seems that Paul was familiar with this
form of mysticism and second Corinthians he mentioned someone who was caught up to the third
heavens. That's all very Merkava language. So that was the dominant form of Jewish mysticism
for about 800 years and then what what begins to happen is that new forms of Jewish mysticism are
pioneered primarily around a text called the Seifer Yetzirah the book of formation and the
book of formation is a very short enigmatic work that we don't know when it was produced
seventh eighth century. This describes the mechanism by which God spoke the world into being
and it focuses very heavily on language and alphabet mysticism and in that text the primary
modes by which God created the world are these things called Sphereot. We don't this word is
complete neologism. It's related to the word for to count but it's not the word for number.
Miespar is the word for number in Hebrew. So the Sphereot are not numbers but there's something
related to numbers. Sometimes I translated numericalities. It's a really weird word to
translate but anyway there begins to be a speculation intense speculation on these Sphereot
these emanations of the of the godhead are these mechanisms by which God created the world and
by the 13th century this speculation on these Sphereot produces a book called the Seifer Bahir
the book of brilliance which is sort of a midrash or a commentary finding these Sphereot in the
Bible and then sort of exegetically building them out into a form of mysticism and then the real
explosion of Kabbalah is going to be in the late 13th century with a text called the Zohar the
Seifer Zohar this is a monumental it's a massive text you can see it over my shoulder there
three volumes that's that's the Zohar there in a very tiny little dense script
the English translation if you want to know is about 12 volumes it's a huge it's a huge text
so that text the Zohar is where the Kabbalah as we know it really is foundationally developed
and then from there there's later interpretations of it Isaac Luria and other folks in the 16th
century will develop it further and there'll be an entire theosophy that's developed out of
the understanding of the of the Zohar and that entire theosophy becomes the Kabbalah as we know
it as developed by Isaac Luria and his his disciple mostly Chaim Vital so if you want to think about
what if you want to think about a parallel to sort of what it is imagine if a new kind of scripture
was discovered in Christianity in the Middle Ages and that's what this book claims to be it claims
to be a book actually written in the second century that goes back to Sinai we know that
historically it doesn't is it fair to just jump in there and say this is kind of what the the
Jews who are becoming the Babylonian Talmud or the Jerusalem Talmud are kind of stretching their
tradition back assuming they go back to Moses that similar tradition for sure for sure the idea
right that all this is ultimately going back to Moses and not saying there wasn't some form of a
tradition of something but they're trying to lay claim to the the kind of like the apostolic
tradition right we go back to but we go back to our church goes back to St. Thomas and that's why
we're you know the Thomas Christians in Egypt or what have you yeah it's a way of legitimating
authority and you do it by linking your linking your text to some really really ancient idea
we know that the Zohar was not produced in the second century like we can tell that from the
we can tell it from the internal evidence inside the text Orthodox people will maintain that it
goes back to the second century and really they'll say it was revealed in the second century but it
goes back to Sinai that's not true and so what you have to imagine is that the Kabbalah is a
series of traditions that have grown up around these texts and the practices that come with them
and just to give you some general idea about how rich this literature is and how complicated it is
we just did on my channel my buddies Evie and I from Seekers of Unity we just did a
we just did a study of a very small part right it's about four pages in the original Aramaic
and it took us nine sessions and about 13 and a half hours reading them out loud and
then working through the logical and scriptural and metaphysical implications of what it all meant
it took us about 13 and a half hours of live streams to get through what's equivalent to about
four four and a half five pages of the original Aramaic of the Zohar so you're talking about a
text that runs into the hundreds of pages thousands of pages it's incredibly complicated and very very
dense so there's layers to this and it's not just simple but it's a mystical practice can you give
us a little more about like if I if I were to say what Christianity or what the New Testament might
teach you'd get a you'd get a ton of different flavors if I were to use it as ice cream you'd
have mysticism you'd have theology you'd have I'd say legend you'd say there there's multiple
things going on in this literature um but there are people who read it who pray over it who
meditate over it who take it as practical wisdom on how to act how to behave is this something you
could almost say is going on here but is it more mystical if you were to put how much percentage
of weird mysticism stuff's going on and what does that even mean what does it mean to be mystical
yeah so um basically the idea right is that the Zohar takes for granted that you've basically
Kabbalah takes for granted that you've mastered rabbinical Judaism which is to say you have a firm
understanding of the bible in the original language languages you have a firm understanding
of rabbinical literature so that's the Talmud of course there are two and the Midrash literature
which I wish there's a library so it just takes that for granted right so if you don't have that
you're lost uh it just it speaks that and so the basic argument the the Kabbalah makes is that
beneath the bible uh the Torah specifically beneath the plain meaning of the of the text
there's actually not just the plain meaning there's a hidden sublayer and that hidden sublayer
is actually a glimpse into a into the world of the divine manifesting itself in reality
and so as the God becomes God and as God expresses God's self in the world it's a very pantheistic
system of emanations and so far as that's happening the Torah is is a is basically a code for telling
you how that's happening and so the trick is you have to learn to not only read between the lines
but you have to learn to read beneath it and so um and so this is for instance why Hebrew and Aramaic
are essential to this process you can't really read it in English and get the the full sense of
it because they're reading things hyper literally so I'll give you an example of this just in the
first lines of the of the uh of the book of Genesis right right in English we just see in the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth right the Kabbalah says nope too fast
right so take the first three words of the Hebrew of the Hebrew
bear a sheet right at at the beginning literally on the head so read it on the head
well what was created right oh it was on the head that's what the subject is
which is not that way that sentence is graphically structured but they're like no it has to be read
that way and it created what bar what it created it now it doesn't get translated into English
it's just a a direct object marker in Hebrew it tells you the thing coming after that is a
direct object they're like no no word in Hebrew superfluous so it's at Alif Tav the entire Hebrew
alphabet so what is the first thing that was created out of the divine mind the Hebrew alphabet
and it's from there that everything else is constructed so it's an incredibly complicated
multi-layered um hermeneutical system among other things by which mystical Jews both interpret
the Bible but also how to live their lives I mean it it also has implications for how one
lives one's life it has implications for how one practices a law for instance we think of
mysticism as kind of like hippie-dippy like you know you just like wear crystals and you do hippie
stuff or whatever you like you kind of you know tune out uh Kabbalah is also extremely strict in
its practice of Jewish law and so um it is a it is a very very strict form of of Jewish practice
where not only is the law commanded by God to do it but it's actually part of making um it's
part of actually realigning the cosmos itself so if for folks who are Jewish in the chat or whatever
if you've ever been in New York or somewhere there are a lot of a big Jewish population you
often see guys chesidic guys with the black coats and the hats and they'll be out on Friday
afternoons and they'll be just asking random Jewish people random people hey are you Jewish
and if you answer yes they'll ask you have you put on Tefelon today the boxes that go on the arms
and on the head and the answer is if you say yes I am Jewish and you say no I haven't put them on
then they'll stop you and say hey could you take five minutes and put these on now why would two
random chesidic guys care whether you've committed whether or not you've performed a commandment in
the Bible because they believe as part of Kabbalah that when a Jew practices the law especially that
law it has metaphysical implications it hastens the hastenings the coming of the Messiah or something
like that so this is a place where um again it's it's it changes people's lives like there are people
out kind of doing missionary work but missionary work not to non-Jews but to Jews try to get them
to be more Jewish it's it's interesting because let's let's take Jordan Peterson for example
everything has a meta narrative um and he kind of applies his own esoteric system when he's
interpreting stuff and for me I've I'm more into the historical reality of what things really mean
what they really say even though it's interesting to learn how people can read between the lines
or come up with these things and I personally would look at patternicity and see how fanciful
we can come up with things in our context through our own experiences and then it's like with numbers
you can make numbers mean anything right you can make words and letters mean anything if you try
hard enough and I think that that might be what's going on in some of these situations where we're
really interpreting things in such a way that does that so um it's it's gotten used it's it's
being used in so many different ways so might be good to anchor this into its original context for
a moment um do you think that the the Kabbalah was meant to be just like on into like to be kind of
reinterpreted forever or is there a historical cultural context in which this thing was
anchored and we can kind of dispel nonsense from what they may have intended it initially
or is there somewhere of knowing that yeah well we know where the principal text of the Kabbalah
was written we was written in northern Spain um in the area um around Agony Moshe de Leon and his
circle is produced sometime in the 1270s 1270s 1280s so we know that's the context in which it was
produced um we don't know why it was produced we don't know why they did this it you know it's a
very strange kind of production um we have there's some scholarly speculation about what prompted
this um there were some forms of mysticism that seemed to have involved appearances of the prophet
Elijah and this may have there may have been sort of a spurning on of this but what we do know is
that the the context there is one of which um you know Jews are living in a majority Christian
culture they're living in a hostile Christian culture right this is world Spain this is the
world that will give birth to the Inquisition in a little while this is not a you know cozy world
this is will become the world of the Reconquista pretty soon and um there were in many cases and
just this is true in historical cases with the history of Judaism in general that when things
get bad messianic expectation goes up right the worst things get the more likely you think it is
the messiah is about to come and save you from everything um you see this in the second temple
period you see this so you know see the black death you see it you know over and over again
so there probably was some messianic expectation and they thought maybe these visions and things
they were receiving were part of this sort of imminent coming of the messiah and um
again the worst things get the more gods in control that's kind of the logic of apocalypticism
and after the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 you're talking about hundreds of thousands of
refugees you know basically told to convert or die um and they were expelled and eventually
settled in in Israel and and Salonica uh in the Ottoman Empire and it's there that they really
went full tilt on this idea that by publicizing the Kabbalah they would basically hasten the coming
of the messiah that this was sort of the last piece of the puzzle and um that's how the Kabbalah
became one from being a very very esoteric text among a very tightly select few group of
elite rabbinical scholars to being disseminated widely into the population this of course led to the
to the um in some ways led to the disaster of the whole false messiah Shabbatites v and all
the things that have come along with that which is grist for the mill for conspiracy theorists and
Shabbatites v and some of his followers but so that's the basically the arc it's born really in
13th century Spain at least the principal text is but it gets popularized beginning in the 16th
century in the Ottoman Empire and that is all tied up with messianic expectations um and the idea that
this terrible you know tragedy and again it's something interesting and people often forget
this because we typically have this weird view that Jews and Muslims don't get along or something
like that there's a it's taking the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and riding it through all of history
which is right just not the case um but people forget and he doesn't get the credit for it but
Bayez II the Ottoman Sultan but when you know the Spanish were kicking the Jews out he realized
these people were an incredible asset in terms of literature and learning and being doctors
and he sent his entire fleet to pick them up he picked up a ton of refugees brought them back
to the Ottoman Empire and people often don't remember that uh there were no printing presses
in the Ottoman Empire until one was established by a Jewish family in Salonica in 1495 so so he
was right and in the you notice the meteoric rise in some ways of the Ottoman Empire after that
they they just basically import an intellectual class um and also think about Spain's fortunes
um in the aftermath of those kinds of things so I think that um that you know that kind of
cultural trauma um fed into the into the Zohar and the Kabbalah in a lot of ways and that explains
a lot of this sort of pretty gross xenophobic um anti- Gentile language that you see through the
through the Kabbalah which is unfortunate but you know I don't get the I don't have the right
nor the ability to change history and sense or what I don't like or what I don't agree with and
it's certainly there but it has a historical context and the historical context is well would
you have a terribly high opinion of the Christians around you who are forcibly converting your people
and exiling you and things you would you would have a low opinion of them I think yeah yeah and I
mean I guess it would be a different situation for me if I saw a huge population of people in the
world who gravitated toward that negative kind of anti- Gentile type thing and it was really
making a major impact that was obvious but instead it's almost like divine hiddenness
you might find a few rabbis who are radical out there that are saying stupid spewing nonsense you
know that is literally you know somehow they relate to that to that rhetoric in their own world
but uh for the most part yeah that's yeah yeah I mean you're talking about a bunch of like it's
the equivalent of you know making the Taliban the spokesperson for all of Muslims that are
making the Ku Klux Klan the spokesperson for all of Christians right um you're talking about you
know Jews let make up less than a one percent of the world's population and Kharedi Jews make up
less than uh half a percent of that you know it's a it's a tiny group of people at the at the end
of the day they're just a tiny group of people who have to record themselves and put themselves on
the internet saying hateful stuff in the name of Judaism and um I didn't want to get caught up in it
but it's good to address I mean what I do find interesting about Jewish history and these books
is they are they're even Jews who see that and say that was bad we don't agree with that like have
that documented in their history and they keep it around they want people to see the good the bad the
ugly the debates that are going on through the Talmud and like you you know you you see all the
voices that are taking place and it's documented for you to look at and so yeah we don't we don't
tend to deal with our heretics by silencing them we tend to deal with our heretics by printing what
they say so that other Jews can look at what they say and go well that guy's crazy um you know you
it's easy to corn the easiest way to quarantine people is by what what it's called religious
expose if you really want to if you really want to if you want a person to shut up let them talk
because eventually no one's going to listen to them if they're saying insane things um
and of course they don't complain about being de-platformed and things like that when you know
there are consequences to the bizarre things that you say or the hateful things that you say you
get de-platformed and all of a sudden the world's against you and it's all grist for the mill your
conspiracy theories but um yeah the worst heretics in all of Jewish history we record right alongside
the rest and the idea is um the truth will out over time and um you know hateful stuff like
that so it's not going to make the cut eventually and even the rabbis of the time look at some of
these other rabbis and go this guy's nuts um so could you give an example that you can think of
or maybe the most famous example is Shimon Bar Yochai I mean Shimon Bar Yochai in the Talmud
he's the worst of sort of the anti-Roman anti- Gentile bigots um and again he's living under
Roman oppression he was himself personally oppressed you know he you know he you know he was a um
he was a hardcore Jewish partisan you know he was one of the he was an extremist we would call him
I think he would like in him very much to um I don't know Mullah Omar from the Taliban he was
sort of the Mullah Omar of the Jews um now he was very righteous but so was Mullah Omar I mean you
can be religiously righteous and still be a jackass um and he was very righteous and very religiously
righteous I suppose and yeah he famously said things like a snake and a Gentile have the same
thing in common they're both better with their heads cut off you know and this is the kind of
thing that is in the Talmud um again we don't censor it it's there you can read it and it is
hateful and bad and I don't agree with Shimon Bar Yohai and the other rabbis of the time were like
no like you can't have that kind of attitude with the Romans because at the end of the day the
Romans are a mixed bag like they actually provide a lot for us and you know we are better off with
their infrastructure and being part of their empire because they keep us safe at night like
it's a complicated mixed bag and so you have some rabbis that were very much part of the
establishment didn't want anything to do with the revolution didn't want anything to do with the
rebellion many of them were murdered by the rebels that's part that goes unquoted and then
there were of course these you know hardcore Roman anti-Roman bigots anti-Gentile bigots
and yeah he gets quoted now of course you know because he's associated with mysticism he goes on
to play a prominent role in the Zohar he's the lead rabbi of the Zohar so again it's all about
sort of like you know how these texts are read and what contexts are read what are the historical
circumstances by which by which they're read you know again like if you take someone like
Malcolm X and you know Malcolm X had plenty of hard things to say about white people but
was it unreasonable to say hard things about white people in like the 1960s when you get
dogs attached on you and your dogs attacking your people and people bombing churches and
killing little girls and it's not an unreasonable position even if it is a regrettable one and
also if we quote Malcolm X out of context early on in his life as opposed to later in his life
where he was much more you know much more interested in working with white people on the
question of civil rights and stuff like that so context matter historical circumstance matters
and with the Zohar it's really important you know how this when this text was produced
how it was produced what it's meant to do who's wielding it now you know and again you take a
bunch of Kharedi ultra-orthodox rabbis from Benay Brock who are living in a completely
insular world that's not has no contact with the outside world and if you take them to be
representative of all of Judaism it's like taking some tribal Muslims from Afghanistan who live in
constant contact with war and be like oh yeah their interpretation of jihad is the only legitimate one
right it's just a complete misreading and oversimplification of a very complicated affair
and isn't it fair and before we go to super chats isn't it fair to say that what happens when we do
that we're making all of the people who identify with this particular name for this religion or
this group whatever they might be we're lumping them in and this is honestly a horrible approach
to understanding these things like finding radical Muslims and saying all Islam is this I mean sure
you can find ugly things and I mean look I've done this right there's a lot of people who are
what people call Islamophobes right but I have I have criticism of all religion
including Islam and even have Muslim friends so like what do you think we should do is more
of a practical thing I'm asking a Jewish question here not so much of a mental ascent kind of thing
what should we do Dr. Sledge to mitigate that from happening do you think more compartmentalizing
should take place do you think we should try to uh stop making things uh what was the term they're
all under one umbrella um thinking I can't even think of the term but what do you think we should
do about it I mean I think one I think communities need to call out members of their communities
who are bad actors I think that when you see people in your community doing bad stuff and saying
evil things and call them out on it like um because it has to be you have to clean your side of the
street first you know it can't be me being like oh Islam has a violence problem I'm like no I can
say that Judaism has a xenophobia problem like Orthodox Judaism has a xenophobia problem that's
rooted in the Torah it's it's in there right the idea of chosenness the idea of you know unique
blessings the idea of all this stuff like I think those are all toxic ideas frankly um I think they
lead to um to feelings of ethnic superiority and stuff like that so it's not for me to tell Muslims
what they should and shouldn't do I think they have to clean up their side of the street and
ditto the Christians and the Buddhists or whoever else it's not like you know I agree with you all
the religions have have blood on their hands and mud on their face and so for me it's taking a hard
look at my tradition and you know cherishing what's wonderful and great about it but also being like
you know dragging it when you drag it because that's uh to me that's the only responsible
way you deal with with the tradition you have to deal with the warts and all and you know I
over my channel my buddies Evie and I um we just studied the Zohar you know continuously on live
stream for the 13 and a half hours you know we just like went through every single line of the
text uh there's a whole playlist of uh just the us studying the Zohar and yeah we went through the
whole thing and when we got to the parts that were really beautiful and amazing we covered those
and we were really happy with those and we covered the parts about why the Midianites and the Moabites
need to be destroyed and how the Moabites and the Midianites are really the Gentiles or whatever
yeah we covered all that and it was not pleasant and it's really gross to have your dirty laundry
aired in public but that's it you can't you got to air your dirty laundry and you got to admit
it's dirty and you got to do the work of owning it and do the work of saying yeah this is something
we need to study we study it not to emulate it we study it not to be like that to learn from the
mistakes of our ancestors and we study it to be honest and open and transparent about what's
there in the in the tradition thank you so I can't imagine other any other ways that you could
you could you could cover it I mean you could oh I guess you could just say well let's just
disavow all religion but I think that's at least for me throwing the baby out with the bathwater
I'm not prepared to do that but I'm also not prepared to sugarcoat a tradition or
our sugarcoat a history and just ignore the things that are gross and bad
we spent I mean people say things like oh the Jews hide the Kabbalah I'm like look ma'am
we spent 13 and a half hours reading the damn thing out loud in studying it line by line
what what else do you want us to do like I I found that that when we did a stream before and you
were calling out bigotry and stuff within your own like the in within Jewish literature right
supremacy stuff things like that and it wasn't enough for some commenters no because they just
because it's just anti-Semitism they just don't want us to exist literally like you could say
yep that was ugly yep that's wrong in the literature we should change nope slavery has been
abolished we or at least you know we would want to see more of that happen because it's still a
thing in the world we live in I mean like you could take a stand against things and it's still
not enough you know what I mean and so some people you're never gonna make happy and that's just the
way the the cookie crumbles right right right yeah and I again like when it's um you know people
also say like why don't you argue with people like that like I don't anti-Semites or whatever I'm
like I will argue I'll argue with someone we have a disagreement over facts right like for instance
our disagreement even overtaste like you might like Beethoven I like Bach right like and we could
just we can argue about maybe who's more interesting Beethoven or Bach like oh you're like oh I see
like you like Beethoven because he's more into romanticism he's more emotional and Bach you
like him because he's more technically interesting in terms of this that's a debate between two people
who can agree to disagree and see the merits in each other argument the difference between that
and arguing with an anti-Semite is they don't want me to exist it's that I think all Bach people
should be destroyed no and notice that that's a very different kind of argument there's no
winning that argument actually there's not even having a conversation because the argument just is
right I just don't want I just don't want you to exist it's because you rule the world doctor
so oh yeah yeah yeah that's why I'm on youtube on patreon and not using my uh international
jewish conspiracy checks that I get every month that's your we know that's how you're funneling
all your Illuminati income exactly you know seriously though um you know I wanted to ask
you one cool teaching from the um Kabbalah is there one that really stands out to you that
you're like you know what I really find interesting and then we'll jump to super chats just something
that you today go that's one of my favorite things I find in the Kabbalah yeah it's what's a really
great teaching in the Kabbalah that I think is really beautiful um I learned this actually it's
recently and it's put very succinctly but it's it was put by my friends Evie from the channel
seekers of unity who's a dear friend of mine and a colleague he's a great guy um but he pointed to
the idea that in the Kabbalah and he's absolutely right about this that um someone's someone other
than me someone other than me their physical need is my spiritual need which is to say if someone
needs something like food or housing or shelter or whatever then I need to that has to become a
spiritual need for me I have to that has to be something I need to fix and so I like the idea
that um that in a in a in a very deep way Kabbalah teaches that um that we're all connected that
the universe is all connected the world's all connected in some fundamental way and that that
what we do in this world has ramifications well beyond us now Zevi's doing a cool thing by the way
he asked it's a largest philosophical collaboration on all of YouTube he's going to all the major
philosophy and religion channels and asking them uh does philosophy have meaning in the modern world
and they have two minutes to answer so he's just going through uh like and it's just a really
interesting kind of project so you know there are like huge channels on there uh my little
dinky channel there's a bunch so you know it's a funny kind of um kind of uh kind of project
but I think that's a cool idea for me that you know we tend to have the idea in America
that we are like atomized individuals right the rugged individual you know like you know home on
the range I'm by myself and I'm free you know as long as the government leaves me alone and people
leave me alone then I'm free we think of freedom as sort of the the ability to do nothing but the
Kabbalah says that's not freedom and that's not liberty we're all connected everything's connected
from this world to the divine realm and everything that you do has an impact on everything else
so one of the big ideas in Kabbalah is being very careful about what you do and what you say
because it has ramifications that you can't control and you are you're responsible even for
the ramifications that that you couldn't control but you're spiritually responsible for those
ideas for those things and so most of us have heard of that the idea of bystander cons bystander
effect right you walk past a piece of trash on the ground because you expect someone else will
pick it up but there's a you know there's an idea that says no like if you're the one seeing it
you're the one destined to pick it up if you're the one seeing the need you are the one ordained
by god to fix it like the fact that you see it means that you're implicated in and so it's a
it's a teaching that I think is very powerful because it means that responsibility is a giant
web as opposed to like you know I'm just responsible for me as opposed to like no
like you're part of this whole thing and you need to get on board fixing it and so I really
appreciate that idea come from coming from Kabbalah and I'm not a person who believes in
mystical stuff or whatever practical implications from that that is so rich I mean we do live in
this kind of in America at least the idea I notice this in different traditions because my my
sisters married into Spanish or Mexican families and so they're very tight-knit the grandmother
and the parents they all live in like the same house for the house next to the same house they
all are as we would say how our ancestors evolved together as units and like my dad moved as far
away as he could from his mom and dad with my with our family my mom moved away as well they
became military you know military brats we relocated but we weren't connected like that
and I see the practical implication whether you think the ontology is true there's something about
even if you wanted to redefine god in the context and go you have to live with your own
awareness of this do something because there is a reward to oneself in this and I find that is true
so there's that aspect of religion that aspect of religion that I think we should always keep
we should have that we shouldn't move past these things so it when I hear people speak and they
say hey I'm religious or I come from a legend and they speak of these kind of practical implications
that I see are very rewarding and necessary for us as humans um I I kind of inside go amen I may not
attribute this to thinking there's really this like man upstairs with a checklist or even if it's
not even that much like I think there's some divine force that's involved I myself um you don't have
to live with myself and so I have kind of reinterpreted some of these models of what we used in biblical
or even like religious language and I still see myself my own consciousness as something that I need
to answer for to myself if that makes sense so absolutely yeah yeah I think that I don't think
there's anything look truth is truth um Averroi says that truth cannot contradict the truth and I
think that if there is a truth to be found in religion then it can be found in secular life too
um and and to me um it speaks powerfully to me because it's just in my tradition that doesn't
make it any more or less true the true is just the true but it's a way of anchoring in a language
that you know comes from my ancestors and you know it's you know the way that we talk it's like you
know so it's so for me um you know I don't think it I don't think it has to be rooted in a religious
language right religious discourse religious ontology because if it's true it's true that's
just the way the truth functions um just like you know people say well religion can justify all
kinds of dreadful things I'm like yeah it absolutely can but so can secularism right
Hitler and Stalin were perfectly secular and uh we're more than happy to massacre millions of people
so I'm for me the question is not whether it's you know secular or religious the question is
whether it's true and if it's true then we can use the work of religion or philosophy to sort it out
but um I'm not yeah I don't want to be because I again I'm not a supernatural believer in a
god I don't believe anything like that so the question for me is like what is not just what
is true but also what is meaningful and meaningful has as much to do with art and history and aesthetics
as it does anything else yeah and I found that that teaching is pretty beautiful the way that
that's described and we don't have enough of that right so people that's a good thing to live by um
let's hit some of these supers if that's cool with you so feel free to super chat your questions in
um we are talking Kabbalah but like mystical teachings anything that you want to discuss
feel free to super chat the questions all I ask is that we're respectful and um Dr. Sledge has
been doing this for quite some time uh I really appreciate everybody in the chat so Sophia Hill
says thank you both so much both of you have a wonderful day yeah thank you Sophia thank you
Sophia I really appreciate the love and the support a Syrian uh I'm gonna butcher this is it Nahrin
Nahrin I don't want to butcher the last name but thank you for the super chat did you have a
comment oh here we go I am posting my question for super chat now for later to watch the show I
read that Kabbalah is taken from the sacred Assyrian tree of life is it any way connected to it
I don't think so um so the the tree of life uh is a the Eitzuchayim is a term actually it's
first used to describe the Torah the the the bible describes the Torah as Eitzuchayim a tree of life
um but um the Sfirot which we were talking about earlier these are these nodes or emanations of
the divine when they're put into a very particular configuration where they're all perfectly balanced
which they never really are in Kabbalah when they're perfectly balanced we call that configuration
the Eitzuchayim the tree of life um and so the idea is that we want to
reconfigure those parts of God to be in balance because the Kabbalists believe that they're out
of balance and that's what causes all the chaos in the world and that God is actually in God is
actually out of balance at some level um which is a very different vision of God than the Christian
God where God is sort of like all all good and all powerful and Kabbalah God is not good or all
powerful um God can be downright evil and your your task is to is actually to fix God
as part of you interacting with the world God is fixing the world and you're fixing God and it
all meets in the middle wow this is a very different conception of God um as a as a as a being uh in
Toto but I doubt it because the safer the Eitzuchayim configuration of the Sfirot um is an ideal
state and we don't really see it emerging until until a bit later so I don't think they're related
thank you so much Assyrian I appreciate you but people like to put uh put lots of these things
like Yagrasil like the the Norse tree lots of mythologies have trees right just because lots
of mythologies have trees and snakes doesn't mean that they have anything to do with one another
right um Dhaka says besides sanitation irrigation the wine roads public safety and peace what have
the Romans ever done for us jokes aside love your work it sounds like more propaganda by the
Judean people's front uh no it's the Judean uh back front of the people's front of the Judean
you know yeah I love that stuff a great joke um yeah you know it's there's a great there's all
great interesting things to be read uh you know all jokes aside but so you know looking into the
history of how the rabbis related to the Romans um you know that the if you read Josephus's um the
the Jewish wars you realize that the one of the people he leaves out in many ways from the
conversation of the rabbis because they weren't have nothing to do with it they were content to
study and do their work and basically you know pay their taxes and keep their head down which they
thought was a pretty good deal all things told um but yeah the the civil war that was the the great
rebellion that the Romans took advantage of more than you know anything else um the rabbis wanted
nothing to do with it you know for them that was a by battle between um between various forms of
extremism and they prided themselves on on being moderates you know um and so um yeah again when
you when you see the vast majority of rabbis in the Talmud and other texts like Josephus mostly
they're trying to do is negotiate peace because they know that you know what do you want to kick
the hornet's nest is that a good idea and it wasn't a good idea yeah definitely wasn't uh I
appreciate that uh super chat that's that's a funny one really appreciate it uh constellation
Pegasus in the house thank you for the support man good to see you here saying the names of angels
will piss them off if you don't know Kabbalah good enough and will make you insane one rabbi says
there's a hospital in Israel to keep these people I'd like to see that place investigated
I would too um there's like the crazy and the religiously crazy um it's a unique brand um
yeah so there's a there is a tradition in Judaism um that's coming out of this America
va tradition where um it sounds like a video game it needs to be a video game where in order to get
to the the throne room of God you have to pass through a bunch of anti chambers these anti chambers
regarded by angels now I know that we typically think of angels as like two-year-olds wings or
something like that but angels in the Jewish tradition nothing like that they're like they're
more like marines they're like spiritual green berets they're they're very vicious merciless
fighters uh they're soldiers they're not they know they're not uh not babies not they're the
coddle you mean this is the reason why you read the Hebrew Bible the first thing that angels say
when they appear is be not afraid because they're real terrifying but um you know there are stories
in the there's lore there are stories in the rabbinical literature and the mystical literature
where people have gone into these um these palaces unprepared you typically need to know the secret
names of the angels and there's some gestures you have to do to you know get past like passwords
and um there were cases in history um and what Constellation Pegasus says even now
where people practice these forms of mysticism and they go inside of these various divine chambers
and um they're not they're they're where they shouldn't be and the angels just they can't kill
them um but they can like decimate their minds and the most famous case of this was a rabbi
in the Talmud named Benzoma he went to one of these palaces and there's a there's an illusion
God sets traps for people it's like goonies God sets traps for people in these palaces
and one of the pal one of the traps is a the water illusion and the water illusion looks like
marble it's so pure water it looks like marble and if you think it's marble and you get confused
and then God like kicks you out or the angels kick you out they don't just kick you out they're like
they like destroy your mind and um Benzoma famously goes to the water illusion that says um
it's this is a wall of pure marble we can't pass through it as opposed to realizing it's water
and he goes out he's kicked out and the text says that he remained outside for the rest of his life
and it's some euphemism for like he could never speak again and he didn't he wasn't interacting
with the world properly anymore and it said and from that day Benzoma was outside and it's a really
weird crib and we didn't hear nothing about him after that like he had some kind of complete
mental breakdown we think um this so we don't know we don't know what happened but there's
lots of stories like that I just to ask you because you've experimented just like I have we've we've
definitely tried substances to see things to experience things you name it um you've probably
done them in religious settings my like I'm curious to know if you think that these men were dabbling
with stuff that sent them into an alternative reality to a point where I don't know if you've
met people who I would almost say kind of fried the brain um definitely met space cadets yeah and
they couldn't like they're they're not the same they like you kind of know by walking around them
how they once were and how they are now it makes me wonder if if these men were dabbling in some
type of substance or it's a good question I mean we do have some records of the breathing techniques
and the physical postures that they that they used one of the one of the breathing techniques
and physical postures was called the Jeremiah position the Jeremiah is famously famous for
knowing the weeping prophet he would place his head between his legs and he would weep hysterically
apparently they would do this they would place their head between their their like sitting like
sitting this like sitting with your legs your knees bent he would rock down and then cry hysterically
then breathe as you come back up and then go back down and cry like cry hysterically and you do this
over and over rapidly and there's some reason some people believe that this was something like yoga
maybe and that these breathing techniques causes them to hyperventilate or deprive oxygen from their
brain and they would have these extreme visions or something so that maybe that's a part of it
right maybe they kill off so many brain cells or something I don't know something but we don't have
I mean it seems like you know the place to go is maybe they were doing some kind of some kind of
pharmacy like some kind of psychotropic drugs we have very little evidence like we just found the
cannabinoids on top of the teleraud shrine so that tells us the least of the all was at the
teleraud shrine we're like hot boxing inside the holy of holies um probably I mean it seems like
there's these evidence for that I mean we have I lived in the ancient world I would have what uh you
know hey you know like if you want to see your god you know it's not going to hurt um but we
just don't have any evidence of it we just don't have any there's not like a smoking gun where it's
like in this book we have a secret part of the book where it says like and you take these routes
think of buying them together and smoke them and you see the angel yeah yeah if it's said it your
point is like we don't have it that doesn't mean they weren't it's just like we don't need to like
depend on that hypothesis to answer the question because you're right hyperventilating and going
into a trance could potentially give them the mystical experience they want I mean we go into
them when we go to sleep we have dreams yeah so this could be dreams it could be you know
we also know sleep deprivation was a part of it um and so alcohol clearly was also part of
as well although alcohol is typically see you make you see that kind of stuff so yeah I mean
evidence of absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so right but you know people there's
two things we have to avoid in this literature one of them is what I call like um there's a standard
academic um what's the right word for it um there's academic bias against uh psychedelics
that's just there we know that's there there's just an academic bias against it but there's also
what I call the other side of that which is like DMT reductionism uh which is if anything is weird
in religious literature they must have been doing DMT it's like the Joe Rogan hypothesis um and so
I think neither one of those um neither one of those work and you know having experimented with
DMT and mushrooms and LSD um they just don't give you the kind they don't produce the kind of experience
they're describing which is a highly technical literary experience and so maybe it's the case
that there is some substance that work in all that we don't have any evidence that there is
and it also doesn't explain the extraordinary detail I'm doing an episode not this week but
we the week after on uh the the books of uh Jew uh which is a Gnostic text produced in the fourth
century that doesn't get any any airtime I don't know why but the apocryphal of John and other
books get all the airtime when it comes to Gnostic texts these are really important Gnostic texts
and they also have this ascent where you go through these various palaces and there are various
angelic guardians and you have to use magic codes to get past them so this was a this was a thing
that was spread through the Eastern Europe you know the Eastern Mediterranean basin uh of course
of which there was a Jewish version and the Christian version and Gnostic version and pagan
version whatever pagan um and um and so this seems to have been spread ubiquitously and also
there they just don't ever mention um the kind of substances that we would think would be involved
and I'd say there weren't chemical compounds out there like that but we don't have a lot of
bad events for it thank you for answering that constellation thank you for the support uh Brent
Brentel thank you for the super chat love your channel and your scholarship Dr. Sledge
what started your interest and reverence in Kabbalah Kabbalah and other esoteric traditions
if you read the comments I had to uh censor over on my y'all video you would not believe I had any
reference or anything um that I'm uh you know um this I'm destroying everything about religion by
historicizing y'all way you know everyone's fine with historicizing things and to it you're a god
that gets historicized right um you historicize uh you know a law or whatever and be like yeah there
was is you know is Arab polytheism before that and the Christians are all fine with it
muslims freak out uh or you know that uh that a lot might be this and that but yeah um uh how to
get into this stuff I just grew up on like a pretty steady diet of like shows like um Arthur C.
Clark's mysterious world and uh in search of with like Leonard Nimoy and these like mystery
shows right like unsolved mysteries there are all these shows about like is there been meter
triangle reel and this Loch Ness monster reel and our UFOs reel um you know uh and I used to
like those shows as a kid and I think what ends up happening to most people is all right you grow
up and either you you go off the deep end and begin believing all of it um and become a you know
history channel watcher um or you become a skeptic and you don't think about that stuff
ever again you're like of course Bigfoot's not real it's stupid um and to me what ended up happening
was I did both I continued my interest and yet I became skeptical like can I give an example
to get your thoughts yeah sure Bigfoot isn't real I don't think that Bigfoot is real however
I'm more interested I'm the weirdo who says why is this phenomenon taking place and and what did
they see um that that made them think this was Bigfoot or are some of these accounts completely
made up maybe they mistook a bearer and thought it was Bigfoot or whatever and like I'm interested
in solving the riddles because I think they can be or at least if they're unsolvable
then we put them in a category but people believing based on that kind of stuff it
interests me that the whole phenomenon interests me yeah the yeah what why people believe anything
at all it's fascinating especially believing relatively unusual things like I mean I remember
doing the math when I was a kid um about the Bermuda Triangle I was like what's a good way
of thinking about whether or not Bermuda Triangle is real well what really great with thinking about
it is does it cost any more to insure boats going through the Bermuda Triangle so for instance if
I'm if I have a big boat and I'm putting a bunch of cargo through the Bermuda Triangle which is a
very popular shipping lane does it does it do I have to pay Lloyds of London any more money to insure
it and the answer is no I don't and I was like well if an insurance company won't take advantage of
that to rip you off and it must not be real and so it was like you know or like um uh uh or like
how let's say that there is a creature roughly that size in Loch Ness how much food does it
have to eat to stay alive and how many Loch Ness monsters must there be in the lock to continue
to generate more children and you just do some math you realize like there has to be like 20
Loch Ness monsters in there and that's too the the lock's not big enough and the lock is actually
notoriously uh oxygen poor and or whatever doesn't have enough food in it to support a big creature
like that so yeah same way for me I'm I'm interested in these questions that I'm interested in
covering them from an academic scholastic evidence-based point of view and it's not to say there's
anything inherently impossible about there being a big foot it's possible the question is like what's
going on there and so when it comes to Kabbalah and stuff like that you know um basically I I
decided that I wanted to study this unusual part of our tradition right our unusual part of uh
as the art tradition I'm thinking of the western world when I think about magic Kabbalah alchemy
you know the occult or whatever and it just turns out that there's not a lot of places that you can
do that study academically and I was like I want to do it because I because it's interesting to me
and so I went and and studied in the University of Amsterdam and did it so um everybody niches down
in academia that's what you do you niche down right like you uh you go from a general bachelors
to now your major in religion now you specialize in early christianity or second type of your
Judaism my specialty just happens to be uh western esotericism I definitely I appreciate you too and
like I think that uh some people who are believers of some sort whether they are christian whether
they are esoteric in their beliefs they're gnostic whatever you could tell they get offended by my
what I do like like I am somehow damaging or tampering with their traditions because I do
have a lot of my stuff is rhetorically aimed at dismantling fundamentalist and apologetic works
however that's what also interests people to even take notice in the teachings that we find
within gnostic circles and such so so we all play a part um in what we're doing and I'm personally
interested in learning all of this stuff knowing what the gnostics taught what they think the weird
interesting things they thought about God or whatever I don't believe it and for some that
offends that makes them not uh not want to hear me out or they think I don't like because I don't
believe it I'm abusing and I have no clue what I'm talking about it's like well do you do you
believe it Dr. Sledge but you know what you're talking about here so I don't see why we're not
you know encouraging that more even if we don't agree at the end of the day on certain things
yeah there there seems to be a weird a weird thing that happens uniquely in the world of
religious studies where there's the idea that you can't really understand something unless you
believe it you know in the same way that like you know if I were I don't know if I were a
studier of of Norse mythology I don't think it wouldn't be terribly surprising that you know if I
didn't believe in Thor I guess like you know but there's an expectation in this field for whatever
reason that like unless you're a real as a terrorist you don't know what you're talking about
so that's the one critique I get like oh you don't know what you're talking about because
you're not really a practitioner this stuff um the other critique I get weirdly enough is that I'm
exposing all the secrets and therefore all of the all of the gurus and stuff are angry at me
because I'm like you know exposing their secrets I'm like they're not that secret man like I'm just
like looking at google scholars and like archive.org to look at these old books and I'm just telling
you what's in them. If you can read it you can find out what they say. Yeah I'm like if your secrets
are being put out there it's not my fault. Yeah thank you for that I just want to make that comment
man. Philip A. Demick says someday comment on Oak Island, Nolan's Cross, what's TOL?
I don't know. I mean there's nothing on Oak Island. I mean they like plowed that entire
island to the bedrock in the 60s or whatever the there's nothing there like it's just it's great
TV I mean it's really fun for the Lagina brothers like to go out there and basically be like kids
spend a whole bunch of the history channel's money like you know sinking boars or whatever but um
no like there's no there's no treasure on Oak Island I don't I I would love to uh I'd love for
there to be a treasure on Oak Island but um the Templars were all massacred that didn't yeah
none of that stuff it's it's good TV but it's bad history yeah the ironically named channel um
like but yeah I um um yeah I would love for there to be some kind of treasure on that island
just because I'm a goonie at heart too but um yeah that what is it the whatever the Atlas Company
or whatever that's like plowed that island to the bone uh in the 60s and they found I would watch
that on what was it like discovery or history or something I was watching them and I was thinking
they're gonna eventually find like a thing right and you know like every time the machine almost
kills a man they dive down into the well and then they almost don't make it out alive they found a
chamber down there like and it's always like they come back with nothing it always tries to leave
you hanging at the end for the next episode or like the the rhetorical like could it be yeah that
the Templars escaped from the Inquisition and landed in Milwaukee I'm like anything could be yeah
like that there's something logically prohibitive about that um the question is what do we what do
we actually have evidence for and um like again if we're gonna study the I don't know the Templars
we should study the Templars and then understand like why they were prosecuted and what happened
to them and if some of them did survive what what happened to them or whatever right but um
again what makes for great TV is one thing and trust me I like good I like good trash TV too
but um you know whether it's ancient astronauts or UFOs or Oak Island stuff I think again
that's uh that's entertainment not they should have to put a disclaimer in front of a lot of
that stuff actually just be like this is in the same way that like you go to a casino and it's
like this is for in your entertainment not uh you can't really uh trust it this is a scheme
it's a you know way to make ad revenue yeah like they warn you on cigarette packs um
pan panag geotas forgive me if I butchered this I've really been enjoying your Zohar streams
wondering if you consider doing something similar on our Chaim of Volazine's Nefesh hot Chaim I don't
know if I'm saying that Chaim yeah uh yeah so this is a uh so Rabbi Chaim of Volazine was a
pretty famous Hasidic master and he has a pretty famous book called Nefesh Chaim the
soul of life the life of the soul um probably not one because I have a complete bias against
Hasidic because I'm irrational and mean um Hasid Hasidism was a form of Jewish revivalism
kind of think about like Jewish Pentecostalism that sort of took hold in the 18th century
I come from a more Lithuanian background and they were fiercely opposed to it in fact they
called themselves the Mitnagdine the opponents those who lock horns with them um probably not
just because I'm not that I don't have that much background in Hasidut and um I just find
like at least from my content I want to go back to as far back into the original sources as possible
and deal with as primary sources as possible as opposed to like you know uh you know Zohar's being
written in the late 13th century you know these are much later you know 500 years later old texts
that were lying on much older traditions and I feel like um and I'm sure this is the same
thing you have to deal with Derek that um that religious literacy is so abysmally low in the
in this world that you really have to do a really firm foundational work to like
be like okay let's get at what the New Testament actually is what does it say
um because if you try to jump four centuries later to Augustine and you don't really see
what the polemics and what the the lay of the land looks like uh before that it's really really
difficult to to have an intellect and have have an intellectually responsible intellectually rich
conversation without having a really firm foundation and you know to to your point on the
super chat most people to have a conversation on Hasidut we would need to have a really firm
foundation and uh not just Zohar but also Lurian at Kabbalah and its uptake uh post
Shabbatite's V and then the rise of the Hasidic movement the Baal Shintov and and those guys so
it's like asking could we do the same thing about a text that people are even less prepared
to to deal with it's it's a it's a difficult um process to go through because you know I'm
actually going to be interviewing let me list off some names here coming up this week um
just to tease everybody so I got you today Dr. Jennifer Glancy is coming on tomorrow for those
who don't know she wrote about slavery in New Testament time with Jesus and stuff um Del
Martin right he's coming on Wednesday and I haven't interviewed Del for a long time I was in
contact with him a while ago but I got I got kind of I guess discouraged we had a conversation on
the phone one night and it was like I don't know East Coast probably like 9 30 10 o'clock I was shocked
he emailed me back and gave me his number and stuff and I was like all right I gave him a call
we talked and he was like what do you want to cover now this was my words so you can get where
I'm coming from and get where he's coming from I said I want to know what Paul meant I want to
deal with Paul what did Paul what was Paul trying to do what did he mean when he wrote some of
these letters and stuff like that and he answered with this thing like stop trying stop trying to
know what Paul meant stop trying to figure out what he said like what he said do you care why
Beethoven wrote his first symphony symphony and I'm like no uh he goes it doesn't matter it matters
how Beethoven is understood or how his first symphony is understood today because it's art
this is how he was putting it I couldn't disagree with him more on this like I'm not saying people
don't make their own like we're talking about Kabbalah and like esotericism and the meaning
and meta narrative as Jordan Peterson does and I have like such criticism of kill all men women
and children of the Amalekites I imagine Jordan Peterson would read this and probably go inside
each one of us there's a man around yeah like inner struggle of the and it's like oh the historical
context please well we got in a back and forth on that for a while on the phone and I just was like
it turned me off but then I did some more research and stuff and I want to talk about
the single savior sex in the single savior book that he wrote particularly dealing with Jesus
and we're gonna talk about that Wednesday that being said I'm getting what you're saying like
you need to have a foundation because if you take Augustine and you interpret Paul that way
you're you're probably gonna miss Paul right you're gonna miss Paul because you're reading
Augustine because Augustine believes that Paul wrote everything that was described to him and he
didn't things like that yeah and there's also historical context that sways his interpretation
of Pauline material and how do we get behind that how do we see the wizard behind the the curtain
here which is Paul if we're reading through Augustine's specific particular biases he's dealing
with or his own historical context centuries after Paul so I'm that's a this is a tough one
yeah it's it's always hard because you never well you also don't want it to be like oh we're just
gonna spin our wheels and do history and never get to later stuff like yeah obviously the history
it doesn't matter because if no one ever read Paul and if I would say that in some ways
Augustine had more impact than Paul did because of he basically pioneered western Christianity
as we know it so clearly he's important but but yeah I feel like for me this is in my methodology
I'm a historical materialist I'm a historicized and so when I when I get into these texts what
is interesting to me what's interesting to me is what what are the historical and social cultural
economic conditions that produce them and it's only when I have a grasp or at least a handle on
that that I can I can begin to have an appreciation for how they get taken up into the the broader
scope of of history so yeah like you know and it's also like and people find this sometimes
unrewarding what I do in my channel is it like well I just listened to a 40 minute video on
y'all way what does this mean for my monotheism I can't tell you that I'm not a I'm not I'm not
here to do theology like that's a I believe what you said Dr. Sledge but how do you fix this problem
I now have what does it mean and I'm like I don't know what it means I you know because that's a
that's a philosophical question and my my channel is not a philosophical channel I can tell you what
it means for me right but that's not what it means and so I think that again it's it's a
it's often people who are raised in a religious environment where meaning is ultimately what
matters and not history and therefore when you do the history and it doesn't line up with what it's
supposed to line up with according to their beliefs and they're they're left with this cognitive
dissonance and that's a healthy place to be if you if you experience a cognitive dissonance sit
with that what I want to defend myself here for just a second and say what you just said is important
to what I do my I know I deal with a lot of apologists and and I know that there's a constant
rhetoric that comes from my channel my ultimate goal in this historical research with many people
who are like me is to show as example and I'm saying it that I have meaning like you have meaning
I have meaning we find our meaning somehow with whatever it is in our life and the things we do
within ourselves and and with others around us that give us those meaning and purpose I try to
combat this this notion that you can't have meaning unless you have this foundational principle
you know metaphysical if you don't know if you don't have a absolute morality for example whatever
like I'm trying to show like no you have meaning I have meaning even if you found out historically
highway was just another ancient Near Eastern deity who you know was evolved over time and
you're somehow going oh my gosh this is popping my bubble I don't think I can literally believe
this anymore well we have meaning you don't need to have that in order to have meaning
I'm trying to give people options is the goal so anyway thank you for listening to my TED talk
no like yeah I think any yeah any any meaning that's that can be historicized away was probably
not a very good meaning to begin with right I mean that's why you said in your video on
Yahweh at first you're like look like I'm just doing historical work here like fair warning but
if finding out a fact like a historical fact like pops your bubble you might want to align
yourself more with historical facts and find meaning there you know yeah I'm the same with
Kabbalah you know when people find out that the Kabbalah is a 13th century invention and it doesn't
go back to the Torah or back to the Sinai or when they find out that Sinai wasn't in the Sinai was
probably in Mount Seir or whatever this can be a real blow to people's belief systems but you
know for me I'm like I can't change the fact they're medieval Spanish words in this book like
I don't get to make the facts thank God I wouldn't want to have that responsibility but all I can
do is say this is what we know and what we know will change we will learn new things and what I'm
saying now will be you know we have to be undergo its own critique but at the end of the day for me
what being open and being willing to receive the criticism and adjust one's worldview accordingly
it's just not I mean aside from burying your head in the sand there's not a lot of a lot of other
respectable options thank you Nadav thank you Kravitz Justin Sledge could you do a video on
Volkish esotericism in the Third Reich or esoteric anti-Semitism more generally yeah I mean are you
trying to avoid the the the people that come in from this kind of stuff or oh no I don't care about
that I'll just block those people that doesn't really matter the short answer is the short answer
maybe probably no and the reason is not because I'm shy away from as you know Volkish esotericism or
Nazi esotericism or whatever the real the main answer that I why I would shy away from it has
more to do with the fact I just don't have an expertise in that okay I just don't I don't work
in the 20th century you'll notice that almost all of the content on my channel skews to about
my pre 1850 I kind of do sorties out from there I'll maybe do a little touch and grab but even if
I cover something like Alistair Crowley I'm only covering him because he has a connection back to
pre-modern times in a way that I can I can tell a responsible story given my expertise so
you know Nicholas Gower-Kark and other folks have written some really great stuff about
about Nazi occultism and stuff like that I in so the one I just don't have the expertise to
I think it gets overplayed I think that when we look at the totality of the Third Reich and you
look at the inner circle around Himmler really in the SS Anenurba it looks like a tiny group of people
but in it in there's a way of making it out to be like the the SS or the Nazi movement really the
SS was sort of mystically inclined and Hitler certainly wasn't I think he couldn't give a
damn about whatever those weirdos were doing up in that castle or whatever but we we we have this
Catholic Wolfenstein version of Nazism right where they're all like it's like a mystical New
War loader and I think that that represented a very tiny clique within you know the Rune Society
and its uptake into maybe a little bit of the SS Anenurba and maybe the clique right around
Himmler but I think it was a really tiny minority of people and I think it didn't have any sort of
long aside from some runes on their uniforms or whatever I don't think it had a huge impact on
the overall ideology of the SS or the overall ideology of the Nazi movement which is heterogeneous
I mean people forget that you know you had as a you know Hitler fanatics and then you also
had just like rank and files of soldiers who couldn't give a shit about Aryan purity or whatever
so again I think I just don't want to there's a part of me that's just like yeah it was there
but I don't think it was that big again it's the history channelification of this stuff
it makes for good sensationalism but I just don't know that it would be that I don't have
the expertise and also I don't think it's that it's um it's um it's it was all that central to
the to the ideology I mean I think corporatism within the Nazi movement scared me a lot more
than um SS mysticism around Himmler thank you thank you yeah what like an interesting topic
that I think of wanting to know more about is just how they came to create their own little
Aryan mythology and like how it circles itself around the folk and the people in this region
and like the land all of that it interests me to learn it's also one of those super sensitive
areas where it's like dude this is look at how bad people's beliefs in this weird mythology really
caused such propaganda against Jewish people it's it's wild yeah yeah it's it's fascinating
I mean like I said the SS Anunerba is incredibly interesting yeah it's basically a wing of the
SS that was sent out throughout the world think much to Tibet and all kinds of places
basically to try to find evidence of this Aryan theory which the Nazis didn't event they they
inherited it it was developed outside of them and a section a clique of the Nazis developed it and
but yeah the the SS Anunerba is sort of the the the real interesting wing of all that
yeah anytime the military and the archaeological wing of a country are combined be worried
no joke thank you jerry uh hogweed hogweed thank you for the super chat I'm making sure I didn't
leave you hanging here there you are I've seen astrology incorporated in Kabbalah if true do
they use zodiacs or constellations yeah I mean so there there is both Kabbalistic and non-Kabbalistic
astrology astrology has a long complicated history and Judaism just like it does in Christianity
in Islam it's never it's never totally kosher and it's never totally forbidden the the the
Jewish tradition which I will speak for particularly has a split mind about what to do with astrology
and on one hand right on the one hand there's a famous saying in the in the Talmud right
in mazal by Israel there's no mazal on Israel there's no there's no astrological forces on
Israel therefore astrology doesn't apply to Israel therefore astrology in general is bunk and we
shouldn't do it and the other position is no god made the universe to work a certain kind of way
and the stars are a way that god communicates you know like like the weather right you look at the
the way the winds change and you're like oh it's gonna rain tomorrow well you look at the stars
you're like well it's gonna be a pestilence tomorrow and so you you basically god is telling you
what's about to happen so you can prepare yourself and so if you're wise you can look up there and
figure it out and it's like no it's just one more way of telling the weather it's just the
astrological weather and so Judaism has always had a split mind about what to do with astrology and
that's true with whether it's Kabbalistic astrology or normie Jewish astrology but you know the biggest
bible commentator of the of the 13th century ibn Ezra also wrote huge books about how to do
astrology so because back then it was a science it was taught in the universities it wasn't it wasn't
esoteric back then actually which is weird not considering how we think of it now but yeah
Judaism has always had an interesting relation you got um Derek did you go to the bait office
synagogue when you were in israel i think so that sounds fair with the big uh the big uh
zodiac in the middle multiple ones we went i went to multiple ones with the zodiac on the floor
one had one you could see had the sun god in the middle the other one was defaced but one of them
wasn't defaced and from greek and hebru uh inscriptions both Gentiles you could see or at
least Hellenized Jews that yeah yeah so again that's like you know if you want a classic example
we have the Talmud saying it's bunk and nonsense and no one should do it and we have it on the floor
of synagogues in the galley multiple yeah so it tells you that it was a it was always a complicated
issue and um so it would depend largely on who you asked about whether they were doing astrology
and whether they thought it worked or not those are really great things to go look at in person too
if you ever go brave new history eliot in the house eliot appreciate you here man thoughts on
a braxis why a rooster man snake i have no idea no one knows uh i mean i'm sorry i just like you
know this when we get into the early days of gnosticism you know like sort of what does this
imagery represent so where does it come from uh why they're an evil demiurge like there's a lot
of speculation but we just don't have a smoking gun um it seems like there were some heterodox Jews
you know sometime first century bce ish first century c e that were that came to the conclusion
that the god that they had learned about him the Hebrew bible is evil for you know it's not a weird
conclusion to come to if you just look around the world's pretty crappy um and so but why that image
of the the rooster man snake um because it's also sometimes also a line in there um
and there's something about monstrosity obviously like there's something about this this entity of
a braxis the out of both right probably out of both is coming from hebrera may like has somebody
with chaos and so the idea that you get a deity that's sort of a mixed up version of a monstrous
of um of of a thing where it's it's it's an inherently confused it's nature is confused
makes speaks to the fact this this creature is somehow you know having to do with chaos somehow
but again speculation i'm just speculating i don't know and and we don't have a smoking there's no
text in agama it says oh and if you're wondering the rooster means this and the snake yeah i mean
exists and and you know people spin it that the the snake is off is orfic stuff offic stuff that the
you know the you know there's a part in the talmud where it says that demons have legs like roosters
you know snakes obviously have a long history and you know and and lots of religions about being
you know malevolent and also like healing healing i think of the brass serpent and the
and moses but the truth of the matter is i don't think anyone knows um
ellie thank you man and look keep fighting the fight just rise above and keep doing what you do
brother uh brentley we're almost done here dr sledge i just and we got to give a plug to you
because we're running out of time we only got like four or five minutes i don't want to go
past 90 minutes given your knowledge of everything esoteric can you speculate the origins of qabbalah
like neoplatonism gnosticism mother mary islamic mysticism yeah the short answer is yes um
so pretty clearly neoplatonism is playing a role in that right we know that they're active jewish
neoplatonist like ibn gabi roll who are a big part of it i think less gnosticism i know that
gershwin sholem and and those folks in the early 20th century really linked the idea that there
was some of gnostic a survival some gnostic ideas uh you know again whatever gnostic is
gnostic is a really difficult category that should be used with a lot of caution
but we know that that that some jews were already independently developing a kind of neodoulism
and dualism dualism was kind of in the air there seemed to have been christian dualists
folks that we now call the kathars were also operating in that in that region in southern
france in northern in northern spain um you mentioned mother mary the that's another important
part of all of it right the rise of the marian cult in spain in the 13th century um
that's also going to be part of the polemics that go on inside the zohar in terms of the
importance of god's female the feminine imminent part of god the schina
and so they're clearly polemicizing against the christians and sort of anything you can do i can
do better with the the marian cult and the rise of schina um islamic dualism isn't going to play
a big role in the very beginning of of the of the kabbalah but it will play a big role later
especially in the dissemination of kabbalah as it sort of rubs up against sufi circles
over in the ottoman empire and have a huge impact of shabbatism and stuff like that so
absolutely there's there all of those things at some level are part of the part of the um
they're part of how the sausage got made to mix by metaphors but um but again i'll give an
example of this we've looked and looked and looked and looked and looked for any connection
you know uh for instance if we could find the word a braxis or if we could find
sofia or yaldabaoth or samaya or sarclas or something like that samya is actually in there
but if we could find part of the apocryphon of john you know barbella mythology it if we could
find some of that stuff in some of these early kabbalistic texts we'd have a smoking gun we just
don't it seems like they come to these conclusions independently and if you get into the weeds of
it uh yeah they're all kind of imminent emanatory systems where there's some kind of cosmic tragedy
well you don't really need to borrow something to make that happen because you have to explain
how you get from an infinite god to a finite world and emanation is one way of doing it
and you have to also explain why the world sucks and to do that you need some kind of
fall some tragedy some metaphysical mistake and so in so far as they're dealing with the
same fundamental logic in the same fundamental world you don't have to really think oh well
secret gnostic teaching survived all the way and they were imported into spain they did this and
that and the other you can simply say well there were people trying to figure out how the way the
world worked and they probably came to very similar conclusions independently of one another
and so uh i would say i would say that just that's what the evidence seems to be um increasingly
pointing us to last one last second here last second gravy jay says in what way does zionism
relate to kabbalah i mean zionism is a secular movement uh it has a religious component now
that's been growing since the 1960s really um and there are definitely religious jews who are
deeply opposed um it's okay i can stay until 145 um yeah so the the short answer is that
if you're looking at really orthodox jews who are really into kabbalah they're going to be
anti zionists um but there are also zionists who are interested in kabbalah who are who are interested
in it and who believe that the state of israel is part of the grand you know apocalyptic eschatology
and it's all part of the plan or whatever the redeeming the messiah so um zionism is a secular
movement and how it gets really how it got taken up into the religious movement it's a very complicated
story but in general um i mean most historical religious jews were opposed to zionism until
basically the late 60s thank you and by the way the largest group of calcitic jews satmarers are
still opposed to it um i know i've heard orthodox jews say things like um um raising the israeli
flag is equivalent of burning a Torah um like because they hate the state of israel because
they think it's an apostate state right they're like only the messiah can make the israel anything
other is is uh is uh is apostasy uh apricorcing wow thank you for that sorry these key look last
two uh dr romanot how do we differentiate mainstream of gnostic pythagorean thought as
older schools merged into eclectic so many shadowy figures like the amonius sacus uh or pentaneous
yeah so amonius sacus was famously the teacher of platinus and panitius i think is who you're
referring to who was the teacher of postodonius he was one of the uh scolars by the way panit panitius
actually rejected astrology one of the few stoics it did um i don't know they were ever mainstream
to be honest with you i think they were always fringe movements um and the way that i i think
that is basically like how many survive you know how many manuscripts of those kinds of folks
survive into history you know two manuscripts of the apocrypha of john versus dozens and dozens
of other texts so i think they were always relatively not mainstream um and i think that
also the way we think of schools is probably probably not accurate i think that we think of like
um i don't know i'm on team this and your own team that i think that it was a lot more i might go
to listen to amonius sacus one day and i might go listen to valentina's the other day and i might go
and they're you know you'd have some hardcore members and you have a lot of people floating
around and i think that it was a it was a pretty amorphous world where these kind of a buffet
in a way i think it was a bit of a buffet and i think that there were lots of movements in
between these things and and some of them were initiatory and i think the fact that they were
initiatory is actually an acknowledgement of the fact that they were trying to get people to stick
with them um that tells me that they didn't want that they wanted you like no pick us you got to
be valentinean or whatever maybe he's a bad example actually because i think that he the
borders of that movement were very very porous in fact um because i don't think he ever called
himself valentineanism he was his christian um but yeah i i don't think they're you know
amonius sacus and panatius definitely aren't shadowy figures they're they were heads of schools i
mean amonius sacus taught platinus and panatius was the lead scholar of uh the stoic a stoic
school and i think alexandra but um i think eclecticism was the rule and dogmatism was the
exception um and you know christianity uniquely i think became dogmatic and you know i think it was
that the early the early uh so proto orthodoxy its dogmatism i think was really unusual
doc thanks for that support and and popping in last minute
erin miller thank you both so much for all your dedication to making scholarship digestible to
us mere mortals yeah it's it's my pleasure you know um i'm for me what's the purpose of
knowing all this stuff if you can't make it accessible you know we you know whether it's
just like making accessible at the level of having conversations or making accessible as
part of like the project democracy i really think that education what separates democracy
from mob rules education right to like a mob rule they're both just a bunch of people deciding to
do stuff but what makes democracy democracy is that we're all thinking before we act and an educated
population especially on religion where religion is playing such a huge role in america american
politics and world politics um the question for me is always like do i want to live in a better
society and if i do i need to be contributing what i can and what i can contribute is this weird
little chunk of knowledge i have and more educated people better critical thinking people um
whether you're religious or not or whatever we live in a better world where people are
thinking harder thinking deeper and you know and if i can contribute to that then then i i will have
you know left the world a easy being a bit better than i than i found it and you know i'll die happy
that's such you that is exactly what i was saying two weeks ago having conversation with
family members about what i mean i hypothesized that you know the way it used to be is this
knowledge needs to be kept away they had this idea about knowledge having power and if it gets into
the wrong hands right like what is going to happen so we need to keep all of this deep teaching and
wisdom hidden from the the common folk uh this idea a lot of people have i don't know if that's
ubiquitous but in my mind it's like if everyone knew this historical research and understood all
of the material we're talking about it would make such an impact on the world um it would change
so much so at first my whole inquiry and the myth vision was purely like just a knowledge thing let's
just learn over time i realized how practical how applicable this is to society and how it can really
change the world in a better way so i love what you said there dr sledge i mean you're doing it
you're doing it and i'm trying to do it as well no you're certainly being a certainly part of it
man you're really again this whole little sphere of love you know religion youtube i think is really
you know making stuff that uh no one should have to go into massive amounts of debt and move halfway
across the country to take a class or learn about the jesus movement or esotericism or anything else
uh we have a platform we have the ability to make it free and we can crowdsource the the costs that
it takes us to do it and it does cost us and you know it allows us to do all this kind of it allows
us to do all of this without uh yeah without uh sinking our ship and again making this stuff
accessible it's just it's just it's well worth it and people deserve to have access to it and they
should not have to go into crippling debt um and some prestigious Yale they can't get into
because they're not born in with a silver spoon in their mouth um they should have access everyone
should have access to material look i'm doing this on air i want to one day if you're available
i'd love to do a course with you dr sledge and make your make obviously it would be beneficial
to helping you but it makes your education accessible and stuff you already do it on your
channel but it might be cool to have like a classroom setting type thing one day so maybe you
me can talk yeah let's talk i'm uh i'm uh take me i'm always listening always uh interested in
what we can do to again to amplify each other's voices and i'm always glad to be to be on your
channel Derek you do fine work and i really appreciate the work that you do so thank you
the least i can do is mention you have your youtube channel please subscribe let's do there's
no reason you're not at a million subs we need to grow the community by doing so you can like his
videos you can share his videos to your audience everybody plays a significant role in growing
these platforms especially i was talking to dr justin sledge this morning you know he's
untangling some of the most mysterious text on planet earth and yet we're talking about this
algorithm that we don't even know how to crack on youtube we're just somehow it's working for us in
some ways you better than me at the moment but uh it's like you know help us i we think this will
help share it out there get this material out there go support him by subscribing go check out his
website go support him on patreon you can do the same for here at myth vision all of these are ways
you can contribute to helping change the world as we said at the end and educating more people to
to think critically to to and not not just bash like value the historical information don't judge
the ancients learn from them like like know what's right wrong and do these kind of things so any
words from you about your patreon maybe you have something coming up yeah i guess a big thing coming
up uh just that you know i'm doing a uh like a celebration of you know the some of the milestones
of the channel this this uh thursday or friday haven't decided yet but um yeah it's like you know
every week i try to put out a new content whether you know and every week it's some live streams it's
some uh original content it's q and a's i really try to keep the the door at esoterica open at least
a couple times a week just so that people can plug in and and you know pick up something so um
but yeah what is anything big playing coming up um we had really we had good success with the
with the zohar with me and zevi uh philip over at let's talk religion has uh agreed to do something
similar with meister ecard so if you're interested in christian mysticism uh we'll be looking at
a pretty famous text by by meister ecard at some point in the future i'm not sure when we'll kick
it off but um you know i i i i enjoy all these texts and i love studying them and
be great to to do that but yeah the what you said about the ancients just don't uh you know
let's don't cancel the ancients um let's study them and um yeah philip also has a great channel
but um yep i totally agree with you with you derrick um we we don't have the we don't have
the luxury luxury of cancelling history uh because it's there whether we like it or not if we don't
learn from it we will repeat it absolutely and i i seriously value and appreciate what you've done
by coming here and joining me at nubis fire thank you great job love the work appreciate
not giving us a question i was still guilty because i had one time done live stream and somehow
missed like three or four because the scholar had to go i got messages of like really upset people
and i was like i never intend i can't help that that happens youtube should you should
should have a refund ability because i also sometimes when i when i like you know with the
abraxist question um like when i just don't know like at some level want to have the ability to
like offer a person a refund and they can accept it and they want to make a donation great but
also don't like if i don't know the answer i don't want them to have to pay for my i don't
know so i wish the youtube would give us a a little refund button where we could actually
go through and refund at least some of them or or whatever i don't know i just just like i think
that uh thus people that run channels or youtube gods that can control everything but you'd be
surprised of how little uh we have we have like the ads on your channel like if i wanted to target
channels to put ads of my own on them i can i have no say over who puts ads on the channel
there's so much we can get a lost oh yeah yeah oh yeah i have like jews or jesus ads on my channel
it's like enraging same here man and i'm like oh i yeah it's like cringe like do not want this so
bad so well yeah there's but they're funding me it's almost like the tithes that go to support
them are supporting me and i'm like you know what so be it then if you want to help support
what i'm doing go for it robin robin hooding we call that exactly thank you dr slidge and
i appreciate everybody in the chat and final words from you no thank you thank you everyone for
their questions and hanging out thank you son do you want to know what the truth is after this
there's no turning back you take the blue pill and you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you
want to you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you just how deep the rabbit hole
goes remember all i'm offering is the truth nothing more
oh
oh
