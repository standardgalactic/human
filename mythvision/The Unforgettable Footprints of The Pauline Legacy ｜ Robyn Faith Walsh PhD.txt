Paul, the connection with Paul's burial of Jesus, the empty tomb narrative in Mark, Paul's philosophy, understanding Paul is so important on getting as close to the origins of Christianity as humanly possible.
I recorded this course with her and it is the most in depth, high quality Pauline course I have ever seen and I hope that you will check it out.
Enjoy this video, like, subscribe, share, sign up for the course down in the description. Don't miss it.
Well, I start with trying to reimagine the historical Paul. So what do we know about him from his own letters?
I tried to stay away from acts of the apostles just because we know it's later, although it is interesting and I do talk about some of the information that it provides trying to fill in those blanks for the things that he doesn't tell us himself.
And so I try to really give us a, there's kind of an arc to the course where I start with the historical Paul and then I try to fill in what I know about the context of his life, not based on things again like acts that come later, you know, church history,
but based on what I know about the ancient Mediterranean world. So what can I tell maybe about his relative education?
What it was like when he went from city to city. And then also looking at his writings, the philosophy that he's using or the other cross references that he's making, both because he's an educated person writing in Greek in the first century, but also because he's talking to Gentiles.
And he's trying to make his idea sensible to them.
When you strip away 2000 years of interpretation and discussion and theology from Paul, I think you get a very, very different image of Paul, of course, but also what we might call the historical Jesus or Jesus in general,
meaning what the figure, let's call it the figure of Jesus meant to Paul and what he was trying to communicate about what he refers to as Christ Jesus, the nature of Christ, the importance of Christ in human events and his significance,
the importance of grafting in as he says Gentiles to be co-heirs with Christ, children of God, his reading of the Hebrew Bible.
We try to look at all of that and to your point about philosophy also understand his terminology as somebody who was a Greek speaker in the first century would have understood it coming from not an anachronistic standpoint of you mentioned Numa,
of spirit as we understand say the Holy Spirit or the Trinity or something like that, but understand what somebody hearing that word for the first time the points of reference they would have had from the ancient Mediterranean world.
So we try to bring all of that together in the course, and then by the end of it, we start to think about the the the legacy, let's call it of Paul, how has he influenced culture, how is he influenced law, how is he influenced, you know, our morality,
common contemporary morality, particularly in the western world, of course, but globally.
So we will be thinking about all these things and holding them in tension.
Each one we try to keep kind of pithy, you know, kind of a quick survey of this material, but there are supplementary materials as well, a couple of exercises that I put together for some of the individual lectures that people can use to reflect on their own thinking after hearing what we have to say.
And so that's basically what the course tries to do is make you an active participant and thinking more about this really central important and foundational figure for both Christianity, but also ideas of western morality.
There are several scholars, I guess, especially it was a more common position amongst critical scholars that Paul was like the creator almost or the originator of Christianity.
But as I asked Bart Ehrman in our last little recording, I was mentioning this to get his thoughts because he's doing a Paul and Jesus kind of thing.
And I wanted to know, I was like, so what are your thoughts on this, Paul being like the originator, so to speak, of Christianity needs as well.
Paul's in his own letters, saying he persecuted this Christ group that follows this, this Jesus.
And my question to you is a Pauline specialist because that's something you actually specialize in is Paul.
I went to grad school for Paul, but I ended up writing about the Gospels, but it was a close, it was a close call.
It was, it was right, right in dissertation on the Gospels or Paul, but I went, I went with Paul.
I mean, I went with the Gospels and I abandoned Paul.
Right, right.
And this, this question I have about Paul, since he says he persecuted the Christ group is, do you think the earlier Christ group believed in some resurrected Jesus?
I mean, he has this list in 1 Corinthians 15, he references them.
Do you think his quarrels weren't about a crucified Jesus, but rather were over like some, you know, mosaic Torah observance or making Gentiles observe circumcision?
Do you think that's what it really boiled down to and that he's entering into an already existing cultic, we believe in a resurrected Jesus movement?
I think that resurrection was not a strange concept in the ancient world, because I think there are multiple people who claim to have risen.
Or to experience something that the word is often used apotheosis, including the Roman emperors.
This wasn't a strange concept.
Also, we know the Pharisees in the first century are one faction of Judaism that does believe in resurrection.
What you seem to have are people claiming to be able to interpret people speaking in tongues or to be able to interpret divine messages, what you might say is divination.
And here I'll also just make a plug for Jennifer Isle's work on Paul and divination, which I think is incredibly interesting.
But there are many people in the ancient world who are making that kind of claim. Paul's not alone in this.
And so it's certainly conceivable that what he calls, say, super apostles are people claiming to have that kind of power, right, to talk to the resurrected Jesus or to receive other kinds of spiritual knowledge or divination experiences that they communicate to others
to try to convey their authority and knowledge of what's going on in what we might call the supernatural world.
To me, all of it's a natural world for someone like Paul.
But I just, you know, you get what I mean.
I think people are all making those kinds of claims.
And I think that's evident in Paul's letters.
But I think you're right that there is also something going on that distinguishes Paul's message, at least according to him from other people who are also Christ followers,
which is the question of whether or not Gentiles have their own covenant with God that requires things like baptism and Eucharist to become, again, co-heirs with Christ through the Numa,
or do they have to subscribe to all of the things that you have to do to become part of the covenant between God, the original covenant between God and his people, the Jewish people,
which would include things like circumcision, dietary laws and following the law.
Paul says repeatedly, the law is spiritual.
The law is good.
The law is still, sometimes I say, you know, the operational covenant between God and his people, the Jewish people.
What's happened is because of Jesus' death on the cross, his faith, often in English it's translated as faith in Jesus.
That's not what the Greek necessarily says.
It's the difference between a subjective and objective genitive, but you don't have to worry about that.
What the text is actually saying is it's Moses' faithfulness in God's plan that creates the covenant with the Jewish people.
It's Jesus' faithfulness in God's plan that creates a covenant between God and the Gentiles.
And so he doesn't want to see other people come in and say, yes, it's a Jewish movement.
That doesn't mean that you have to convert to Judaism.
This is the language we would use today, convert.
You don't have to turn to Judaism to make that the way that the Gentiles are grafted back into this family tree of Abraham.
You just have to follow this new covenant and you can ignore things like circumcision if you're a Gentile because you have these other tools at your disposal.
I want to throw you a curveball just to get your ideas.
This is something I do.
I'll interview 20,000 scholars and I'll ask 20,000 scholars what some other scholars' thoughts are and then just get their opinions.
I don't do it to pit people against each other.
I get it to kind of just get the ideas of what scholars think and why.
And so I traveled to California not too long ago, interviewed with Richard C. Miller in person, did a ton of different interviews.
And in his book, Resurrection, Reception and Early Christianity, he kind of highlights that there's this almost a topos like this.
There's like this tradition of eyewitness testimonies from the mythic Romulus tale.
But it materializes in the Roman emperor cults with Augustus, Julius, you name it.
Even eyewitness testimonies after the emperor would die about people seeing them apotheosized, divinized, deified better yet.
And he made a connection I never thought about.
Wanted to get your thoughts was this first Corinthians 15, what we call creed or eyewitnesses that we have listed.
He thinks there's a good chance since this apotheosized man that they're using a Jewish term resurrection for,
even though they're pretty much doing the same thing, the other deified resurrected figures claim about their people,
is that these are eyewitnesses like what you're getting with the Caesars, like what you're getting with the Romulus tale and such.
So it's hard to nail down whether or not this is a memory of like real people claim they're actually seeing,
or if this is what you did when you deified your figure is had people say,
haha, we have a tradition of eyewitnesses just like your guys have a tradition.
Where do you fall on that spectrum of are they really, do you think they're really claiming that they're really seeing and they're actually claiming to see something?
Or is it more along the lines of like we have people coming forward purposefully saying they witnessed as part of the topos?
I know you can't judge their motives, but what do you think personally?
Well, it's such an interesting, but it's such a hard question because you don't want to project the skepticism of modernity on to ancient people,
but you also don't want to make it sound like ancient people are either just all trying to get one up on each other by making some kind of fantastic claim,
or on the other extreme that they believe anything or like they're seeing things, right?
We have this kind of modern skepticism that makes this a really complicated question, which also makes it super interesting.
What I can only look at really are the texts and like you said, the topos is the perfect kind of word.
You know, what happens in other kinds of literary texts where eyewitnesses are invoked and it's not just the Gospels.
You see it across literature, including in people like the ancient historians.
I'm thinking of someone like Herodotus right off the top of my head where if you're going to make a claim about something that seems pretty fantastic,
one way to sort of temper the idea that people will come back at you and be like that's completely not believable.
And by the way, it's really hard for me not to cite the Boston song like don't stop believing whenever I talk about any of this stuff.
But my point is, you know, you cite that like, well, I talked to somebody who said that they saw it.
And when you think about how knowledge is conveyed in the ancient world, this is kind of how it's conveyed, right?
You know, you don't have cameras. You don't have, you know, real time reporting.
You have artistic work. You even have, you know, things like coins. You have things like arches.
You have writings. You have other ways that histories are told, including, you know, by word of mouth.
And I think we have to be careful about how we separate these categories, at least conceptually, and how we talk about them.
Is it the case that in literature you have, again, these eyewitnesses encoded in the text quite often? Yes.
Are they all true eyewitnesses of something that actually happened? I doubt it, right?
Especially some claims are so plainly fantastic that we have no problem dismissing in modernity.
I'm thinking like there are some really hard things that some of the historians say about territories outside of the empire
that they know, you know, people have like certain disfigurements or that like their blood is a certain color.
I mean, things that we know are not true, right? Like we know that couldn't possibly have been true even then.
We have to remind things that are like fantastic, you know, miracles.
So sometimes people just say things that aren't true and they claim eyewitnesses have told them.
That certainly happens. But we have to keep that kind of intention with the other thing that you tend to see too,
which are claims about eyewitness testimony about fantastic things that we can evaluate from a different perspective.
I'll give you one example, which is people also thought that they saw the resurrected Nero all over the ancient world after his death.
And you've heard me say before he was like from what I can tell the Justin Bieber of the late first century
because he was supposed to be like, you know, this great musician and I don't know how attractive he was.
I mean, that's kind of up for, you know, that's a subjective judgment.
But people kept saying, you know, I've heard this guy, he's a great musician out on nowhere.
He must be the resurrected Nero, right? Like these claims are all over the place.
And certainly you're going to see, you have to judge the motivations.
Not that again, like you said, you can always make a stable judgment on all of this for every single case.
But if you have somebody who's been hired by the empire to write the lives of the Caesars
and claim that, you know, the founding, you know, figure of Rome and then all subsequent leaders of Rome
were all, you know, resurrected to use that language or have experienced apotheosis and they're now a god.
You know, you can start to evaluate the truthiness of that claim in a particular way, given context.
So we always just have to keep it as dynamic as possible when we make these judgments
and then think about those literary tropes if we're dealing with literature.
Think about other kinds of discourse and narrative we know is going on in the ancient world.
And so I think that that's something that Miller does a really admirable job of
is trying to aggregate all of these things and evaluate them on their own merit.
This is a fun discussion and I'm glad to have you as another class assist,
but also a specialist to understand the New Testament scholarship that's out there.
And so we just discussed this eyewitness thing and, you know, there's various hypotheses
that, you know, is cognitive dissonance explaining it?
Is it postmortem, a bereavement?
But then how does that explain Paul?
What is, you know, there's so many different things.
I definitely look forward to reading your friend on divination and Paul
because I do think he's a strange mystical, like mystic kind of guy.
But then I want to leap a little here.
Let's marry the gospel of Mark to Paul assuming Mark's first without diving into Mark and priority debate.
Let's just go for it.
Mark and priority is the case.
You have an empty tomb.
As Richard Miller also has written about the body goes missing.
He has like this list of Greek and Roman heroes.
Yeah.
Yeah. In Jesus is missing.
It's a tough one.
But Paul says in first Corinthians he was crucified.
He was buried.
He resurrected.
Many scholars.
Dale C. Allison Jr.
Others want to go.
I don't see a problem with continuity between empty tomb of Mark, burial of Paul.
Like it's not a stretch to them.
Others go.
It says nothing about a tomb.
It just says he was buried.
That could be a common grave.
That could be this, this, that.
What do you think?
And let me just say one more caveat as to my discussions with Richard Miller, what he said.
With Paul thinking empty tomb.
Because in his mind he thinks Paul's already part of, they've already established the mythic apotheosis translation fable.
Paul is late as Paul Fredrickson would say on the apocalypticism.
But the cult has already developed its mythic resurrected Christ narrative in some way.
There's not a gospel yet.
We already have like the foundation.
It's not like Mark invented everything whole cloth is the point that I think Richard's trying to get at is that Paul's already talking in legendary terms about this Christ.
What are your thoughts about the empty tomb connecting it to the burial quote unquote.
And then I have another thing I want to talk about the missing body, but anyway, please.
So you're right.
The scholars have sort of jumped all over with this particular answer.
And you've cited some of them here.
And also I have in mind a couple of 19th century German scholars who would say well like of course he wasn't either put into a more buried because if you were crucified, you were denied that so that that even in itself was fantastic thinking.
Some people have also said, you know, I won't name any names, but you alluded to it that like, you know, it's kind of like idiomatic speak or speech or like just kind of saying like oh he's dead and buried even if someone's been cremated right.
We might use that kind of language today.
So that it might just be kind of euphemistic, I guess, that he's saying that he was buried and risen.
So I don't know how much difference it does make.
It does make for a more consistent narrative within the gospel though, especially if you have somebody donating some burial space right you know there's all kinds of ideas of patronage here.
There are some scholars who have argued in the past just kind of generally that whenever you see a minor character mentioned in kind of an auspicious role in terms of them interceding in particular events and like a compassionate or meritorious way.
So somebody donating their tomb, somebody helping, you know, volunteering to carry Jesus' cross that these might be the patrons for a text, you know, somebody who's a financial backer who wants to put their fingerprints on the text.
These are all operative theories within scholarship to how to explain the gap that you're identifying.
To me, it's sort of a neither here nor there.
I think that the question kind of gets at this idea of, you know, is there a gotcha moment between Paul and the Gospels.
And I sort of, you know, not to be disappointing, but I sort of put my hands up and say, you know, I'm not sure.
I think that the idea is there that he has died and resurrected.
And the empty tomb, though, as a motif, which Miller has demonstrated, I think so beautifully, is a literary motif that is persistent.
It pre-exists strongly, consistently the Gospel narratives exist afterwards.
He gives all these examples of missing bodies in that book.
Again, it's a really great book.
I think in my own book, reflecting on Miller, I counted something like over 120 examples of this with individual figures in the ancient world.
So I think it could be more of back to that idea of topos, like the idea of the empty tomb, just symbolizing the gravity of the situation, the significance of it.
And keep in mind, you know, when the Caesars experience their apotheosis, if they're not cremated, their bodies are also entombed, right?
So there's interesting kind of parallelisms going on there as well.
Do I want to subscribe to any one as a theory for this?
Not necessarily, but I would recommend that people look at Miller's book and look at all these other ancient examples, because I think sometimes people will be surprised to see how much this was a persistent kind of image in the ancient world.
So please check out those lectures.
Yeah, check it out.
Beyond the lookout.
So do check those out.
Sorry.
So through these lectures, I've given you an idea of how you might approach thinking about Paul or rereading Paul.
So please check out those lectures.
I'm a bit polemical here, but I'm going to throw it at you to see what you say.
I thought about this and I said, okay, Bart Ehrman, others think it's complete legend, the empty tomb, others think, no, no, no, there's a real empty tomb and there's a spectrum, right, of different people who think maybe the Jewish elite relocated Jesus' body the next morning and then they came and there's this empty tomb and then others think that
Yeah, the disciple's soul body, you also have the swoon theory that you never die, you have so many rationalizations to make sense of this.
And I thought if we were going to have to say this happened in some way, like meaning the body went missing, what best explains the data.
After reading Miller's book and reading your book, I thought it would be a great idea to see how much this was a persistent image of Paul.
What best explains the data.
After reading Miller's book and reading your books on the Gospels and reading and going through the course, of course, I helped edit that.
So like getting aware of Paul and like trying to get my world wrapped around this is that if we played the game that this is somehow historical, then I really would have thought the disciples would have stolen the body.
And the reason I thought I had a good motivated reason is that is they would have known the body needed to go missing for their cult leader to become a god, to be deified.
So I noticed there's so many other questions that would be raised and like can be brought up like why would they die.
People would argue for something that they know that they did to lie about people die for things they lie about all the time.
The point of getting is that you would have made sure your person was missing just like they melted the wax effigies of the of the Caesars in the Roman imperial cult.
But everyone saw there's no bones just like Hercules.
So you kind of I imagine that that made sense.
What are your two cents on my little speculation?
Well, I think that you give a lot of how complex the question is right and all the different pieces you have to have into play.
Sometimes I wonder how important it is that the body is still there, although I know bodily resurrection is supposed to be the point right.
But if he is appearing to people like Paul like the twelve right, you know, that we have in the as part of that discourse in the aftermath or at least in the surviving writings, then as long as he's appearing bodily in a pneumatic form, that might be good enough.
And then whatever literature does with that in retrospect becomes kind of a device to communicate those ideas.
So I have I can't help but reflect back on, you know, many of the heroes, the Homeric heroes had cult sites.
We might call them but, you know, temples where their bodies are reputedly buried and that people would go there.
And this is a much later text, but just to throw one out that the people might find interesting is the heroic kiss where you have somebody who was formerly a literate, you know,
successful person in the city who goes out into this kind of more rural region and claims that the bodily resurrected we could use resurrected figure of one of these heroes at his own cult site continually appears to him.
And so the same kind of language is used there that we are seeing in the Gospels.
It's actually something I'm working on now.
And so this idea that you would have a vision of that bodily resurrected body, did you need the body to be disappeared for that to still be something that would be convincing or authorizing for people.
I have to think about that a little bit more.
But as a matter of literary storytelling of signaling, whatever signposting whatever word you want to use, the empty tomb certainly gives a very direct very vivid illustration of precisely.
What the gospel authors are trying to get across.
That is a really interesting point you bring up.
And I've had this debate with academics on the channel.
Steve Mason, James Tabor, they say it's a pneumatic body.
The physical flesh and blood does not matter.
And Paul literally says that flesh and blood does not inherit the kingdom.
Luke talks about flesh and bone that Jesus is flesh and bone.
Are they contradicting?
These are questions you know people ask, but it's interesting because both of them go, you know, he could have stayed wherever.
I mean, even James Tabor has brought it up like he thinks that Jesus's body could have remained wherever it was on the cross in a common grave wherever and however.
And still they could have been saying this man resurrected and he's in a physically or some pneumatic physical sense.
Because remember we talk about that in your course on Paul, what is meant by pneuma and they're going to have to sign up for that.
But it's an interesting thing you just bring up that makes me wonder, like, are we arguing about something in creating categories that weren't the categories they were thinking in.
There are flexible categories in my mind because if you also do something that I never advise to do, but I think it's helpful.
Think about later and sort of we can reverse engineer what happens with the cult of the saints.
So the saints resurrect bodily quote unquote, but they resurrect because they have sacrificed themselves because they've been martyred to use the language of the church, you know, in ways basically by the Roman state, imitating Christ.
Right.
So you see this language throughout martyrology throughout letters like Ignatius's letters, etc.
But their relics, their bodies are preserved in places like the catacombs right or turned into relics these physical objects of the body itself.
Even though we know that the spiritual body of this saint has automatically resurrected and is up in heaven at the right hand of Christ like this is all language that should seem familiar.
Because people pray to these saints as intercessors as they wait for their own resurrection at the end time.
Those who are martyrs and saints go directly up.
Right.
They don't have to wait for that resurrection like the rest of us.
And you still have, you know, some kind of attachment to the physical body there in the form of relics.
So you don't necessarily need a whole body resurrection to accomplish this.
Where you do see whole body resurrection though and I'm sure Miller gets into this is in some of the foundational heroic figures of, you know, the founding of Rome.
Right.
It just, it portrays the gravity of the figure.
And also, I mean, like for those who are trying to think of maybe a historical rationale, although I don't like to speculate.
Certainly, you know, bodies on the cross were often kept up as a dire warning to others who may transgress, but they could also be taken down from the cross and disappear.
Right.
And so, yeah, if his body disappears by other means as a historical question, then, you know, this is this is one of those.
One of those issues that I fear we may never come up with a great definitive answer to.
But we can certainly keep in mind historical processes, literary tropes, and then the greater Greco-Roman world and where we see the same, whether we call it motif or same kind of discourse or same kind of events being described.
We can have really interesting conversations as we've had right now, just comparing all of these things.
But can I give you a definitive answer to it right now?
I can't.
But it's something I'll continue to think about.
This is what I appreciate about what you do, Dr. Walsh.
And at MythVision, it's been my goal to understand.
This goes against some scholars I've had that are like really postmodernist and think that everything's so subjective.
We can't get to the meaning of things.
But I want to know what Paul or the letters of Paul meant, even the pseudo Paul.
The non-canonical Pauline tradition.
I want to know what they meant, when they wrote it, to whom they wrote it, and some of that stuff is lost to us.
But we're trying to reconstruct using heuristic approaches.
We're not limiting it as like it's this insulated bubble that you got to look at the bigger world and the literature around and archaeology and several little things that add up to make sense of it.
And you do that.
So what should people look forward to with this Paul course?
Paul doesn't get enough attention, to be honest with you.
For somebody who had the innovation of thought and the creativity of mind to merge together,
what are seemingly disparate worlds to us today, although not in the ancient world,
but Greek and Roman philosophy, Hebrew scripture, his particular learning and knowledge and experience,
call it divination experience, call it what you like.
But of this risen Christ and trying to make sense of it, not only for the people to whom he writes,
not only to the people he describes as competitors or skeptics, we might use that term,
but to himself, you know, you see that going on, especially in his genuine letters as well.
He's trying to explain this experience that he has reputed to have.
And this, the word we use for conversion actually means to turn, this turning that he's had
and the significance he thinks that it has in human events.
If you imagine the imperative that he must have felt that he thinks the end of the world is coming
and it's, you know, on his shoulders against even, you know, Peter and James to try to bring this into reality,
you know, to bring in these Gentiles into the fold.
It's quite a mission.
I don't think mission is, it's maybe a troubled word in many ways in the way it's been used,
but it's definitely a mission in the sense of its difficulty, of its complexity.
That alone is something I think really worth investigating.
Bring on to that then as you mentioned the way that Paul is untaken up in later centuries
by later figures as not only something or someone to think with or through,
but also to write in his name to imitate him, to imagine him as a founder of the church
and then to write stories around that, that inculcate that into the Christian narrative.
Again, even though he's a man who never met Jesus, the historical Jesus,
which is going to become so important, you can say for us today,
certainly the case that we want to know more about the historical Jesus, not a concern of Paul's,
but even the gospel writers, right?
It doesn't take very long to get from Paul to the pen of the gospel writers
trying to reimagine the life of Jesus, and one of the only sources they have written down is Paul.
So you really can't measure his influence and his significance in the course of the history of Christianity,
but I would also argue that what you have is through his thought,
through his claims about things like morality, the nature of the world and the world to come,
real influence again on how we've constructed ideas of morality and modernity in the western world,
especially how we've codified certain kinds of law and even how we understand who Jesus was.
Again, even though he's a man who didn't meet the historical Jesus and historical Jesus
and he challenges what's important to us, right?
Whether you're a person of faith or somebody who's just interested in these things from a secular perspective,
looking at Paul challenges all of our preconceptions, challenges, all of these, again,
layers of interpretation of history and theology that lie on top of creating that more linear narrative
for the founding of Christianity, tells us a lot about Judaism in the first century.
Sometimes that gets lost. I mean, Paul is such a good stoic in many ways,
our middle plain is that I think he's forgotten sometimes as a philosopher.
He wears all of these hats, and I don't think that you can really underestimate the significance
of all of that, and so we try to accomplish a little bit of it.
It's not really quite possible in a series of, you know, eight or nine lectures,
but we try to get at some of that in the course.
And so at the very least, I think it should stimulate thinking,
probably make some people angry, but that's okay.
At the very least, it'll get people thinking and really, again, kind of being self-reflective
of their own questions, why they're asking them, their expectations,
and then it becomes this, you know, a mirror onto yourself,
which I think is why I continue to do this and to challenge myself
and to be able to bring that to others, even if, you know, you can't or won't
or don't want to pay college tuition.
It's a little, it's a chance to have that kind of glimpse,
and I think that that's a real gift on both sides.
I hope you go sign up because you won't want to miss it.
It's in 4K, very high quality, deep, deep dive on Paul.
I love what you said, everything that you said.
I look forward to having people sign up.
If we get enough people to sign up for the course, Dr. Walsh,
I'd love to have like a Zoom follow-up meeting with, you know, our students.
And I want to bring more scholarship like this of yours and others to the world.
So sign up for the Paul course down the road.
We're going to be also bringing up the gospel course.
So maybe for those who sign up for the Paul course,
we can figure out something to give them a deal on also getting the gospel course.
But I really do appreciate your time and I love how balanced, how non-dogmatic,
but assertive you are on facts that we do know.
And then leaving open the questions for things we shouldn't be so dogmatic about
even if we think, hey, that might be the case.
I just, it could also be this, it could also be that.
And that's the measure of a true scholar in my estimation.
Thank you very much.
And thank you for everything you do too, Jerry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
